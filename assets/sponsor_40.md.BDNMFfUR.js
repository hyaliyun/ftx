Deters (born April 4, 1957) is an American politician of the Republican party who currently serves as Prosecuting Attorney for Hamilton County, Ohio. Career Deters began his career in public service in 1982 as an Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor. In 1988, after six years as an Assistant Prosecutor, Deters was elected the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. In 1992, Deters returned to the Hamilton County Prosecutor's office when he was appointed and later elected Prosecuting Attorney. Deters started the first victim and witness advocate program in Hamilton County. He was subsequently reelected in 1996. In 1999, Deters was sworn in as Ohio's 44th State Treasurer. As Treasurer, he was responsible for collecting, managing, and investing over $11 billion in assets for the State of Ohio. During his six- year tenure, the Ohio Treasurer‚Äôs Office received 23 national awards for innovation and technology and earned interest on investments faster than any previous administration. In the fall of 2004, Deters became a write-in candidate for his former position, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney. He was elected Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney on November 2, 2004, with nearly 60% of the vote. He was subsequently reelected in 2008, 2012 and 2016. On April 1, 2005, Deters and Matthias Heck were sued in their official capacity in a federal lawsuit, Citizens for Tax Reform v. Deters. In 2012, Deters was highly critical of Xavier University for expelling Dezmine Wells, one of its basketball players, due to a rape allegation. Prior to the school hearing on the matter, a grand jury had refused to prosecute Wells and Deters, who is known for being tough on crime and said the prosecutor's office had conducted a thorough investigation, maintained that the accusation lacked any credibility and the decision \\"wasn't even close.\\" He said that the school proceedings had egregiously violated Wells' right to a fair hearing by putting the burden of proof on Wells instead of his accuser, had assigned incompetent staff to examine the forensic evidence, and prevented Wells from presenting evidence which would have proven his innocence. After learning of Xavier's decision, he called for the university to reexamine Wells' expulsion. On July 29, 2015, Deters oversaw the indictment of University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing in the killing of Sam DuBose during a traffic stop. He called the killing \\"totally unwarranted\\" and \\"senseless.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/us/university-of-cincinnati- officer-indicted-in-shooting-death-of-motorist.html His comments regarding the killing received some criticism from the public. Many critics also pointed to the published comments of the editorial board of the Cincinnati Enquirer which had previously criticized Deters for his remarks about a violent assault earlier that month which he had decided not to charge as a racially motivated crime. In describing the people responsible for the assault, Deters called such people \\"soulless and unsalvageable\\" and implied that he perceived a race or broadly generalized socioeconomic status origin to this type of violence when he said further: In July 2018, Deters said he wants the state to bring back death penalty by firing squad amid complaints about lethal injection.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ohio-prosecutor-joe-deters-bring-back- firing-squads-for-executions/ Affiliations Deters is a 1979 graduate of the University of Cincinnati and graduated from the University of Cincinnati College Of Law in 1982.

This expansion, as well as the rest of the block, is centered on artifacts and was only the second set to do so (from a card frequency point of view) since Antiquities. The percentage of artifact cards is much higher than in any preceding set. Each of the expansion symbols in the Mirrodin block depicts a legendary artifact: ' (Mirrodin), ' (Darksteel) and ' (Fifth Dawn). Storyline: The world of Mirrodin The setting for Mirrodin is a plane by the same name. An artificial world created by the planeswalker Karn, originally named Argentum, and named after the Mirari by Memnarch, Mirrodin's environments and inhabitants mix organic and metallic. Mirrodin is orbited by four satellites, which are called suns and moons interchangeably, that correspond to red, black, white and blue magic. Green was notably absent until Glissa Sunseeker became a conduit for its birth. The set focuses on five main regions on Mirrodin, each corresponding to a part of the Magic color pie: * The Oxidda Chain, a range of mountains populated by goblins and the human Vulshok tribe. * The Tangle, a dense jungle populated by elves, the human Sylvok tribe and beasts. * The Mephidross, a mucky swamp, and a home of Nim (zombies) and the human Moriok tribe. * Quicksilver Sea, a sea of mercury populated by Vedalken and the human Neurok tribe. * Razor Grass Fields, the plains of Mirrodin, overgrown with sharp metallic grass and home to the Leonin, the human Auriok tribe and Loxodon. The main character of the story is the elf Glissa Sunseeker, who visits all these places, guided by revenge against the machines that killed her family. The story is captured in the novel The Moons of Mirrodin by Will McDermott. Magic returned to the setting of Mirrodin with the Scars of Mirrodin block. =Darksteel= The Darksteel Eye is the second novel in the Mirrodin Cycle by Jess Lebow. It continues the journey of Glissa, after the infiltration of the Synod and the recollection of all the golem Bosh's memories. They now must travel back across Mirrodin to seek the power that resides in the center of Mirrodin. =Fifth Dawn= The final book in this expansion series is simply named The Fifth Dawn. Glissa, Bosh, and Slobad journey deep within Mirrodin's core to confront the insidious Memnarch. With them is the Kaldra avatar‚Äîan immensely powerful being of energy summoned when Kaldra's sword, shield, and helm were brought together. But what was supposed to be the world's salvation turns out to be a vile trick. With a single spell, Memnarch seizes the avatar and turns it on Glissa and her companions. Kaldra's avatar relentlessly pursues Glissa into the Tangle, destroying everything in its way. Finally, at the Radix, Glissa's destiny becomes clear. As rage and despair overcome her, Glissa's body calls forth a great column of green mana from Mirrodin's core, annihilating the avatar in the process. Now that mana hangs overhead in a glowing sphere‚Äîthe green sun at last, Mirrodin's fifth dawn. Set history =Mirrodin= Mirrodin is notable for being the first expansion set to feature the new card front design (which debuted in 8th Edition). The high number of artifacts in Mirrodin highlighted the inherent flaw of the new border design ‚Äî artifact cards, which were now bordered in a very light grey instead of brown, were very hard to distinguish from white cards. The problem prompted Wizards of the Coast to change the bordering background of artifact cards to a much darker grey in Fifth Dawn. Also due to complications when switching to the new card frame, mana symbols in the text box of Mirrodin cards are greyed out instead of being in color. Beginning with Mirrodin Wizards reduced the size of their large expansion sets from 350 to 306 cards. This was due to regular complaints, that Wizards was producing too many cards and players could not keep up. Beginning with Darksteel Wizards also increased the size of small expansion sets from 143 to 165 cards. Thus the number of cards released each year would stay the same, but then Magic developer Randy Buehler explained that Wizards believed this change would make it easier for collectors and players to keep up with the number of new cards as these would be released more homogeneously over the course of the year. =Darksteel= Darksteel was the first \\"small\\" expansion to have 165 cards, whereas previous small expansions had 143, (with the exception of Legions which had 145 as a balance among the five colors.) =Fifth Dawn= The name Fifth Dawn is derived from the plane's five suns. Each sun is associated with a color of mana and the green sun, which has long been absent, returns to the sky as part of this set's storyline. Fifth Dawn adds a new twist to artifact theme of Mirrodin and Darksteel: it encourages using colored mana for playing artifact spells, via the Sunburst mechanic (see below). Fifth Dawn introduced an enhanced design for artifact cards, which uses a darker inner border to help players distinguish artifacts from white cards. Fifth Dawn theme decks contained a few reprints from Mirrodin and Darksteel with the improved card face. Mechanics Mirrodin introduced a number of new mechanics, including Equipment, Affinity, Imprint and Entwine. The artifact subtype Equipment, which has become a staple of Magic, represented weapons, clothing and armor that could be wielded or worn by creatures. Equipment functions like the older \\"Enchant Creature\\" cards (now called Auras) in that they provide some effect while attached to the creature. Unlike Auras, however, Equipment can only be attached to creatures you control in most cases, and remain in play even if the creature they were attached to leaves play. Affinity reduces the total cost of the spell by the number of permanents in play of a certain type, which in the case of Mirrodin was always artifacts or basic land types. Entwine was an optional cost on modal instants and sorceries, which allows a player to choose all effects (rather than only one) if the Entwine cost was paid. The Imprint keyword allowed an artifact to gain additional effects if another card is exiled and imprinted on that artifact. Mirrodin also had an infamous cycle of artifact lands. Darksteel continued the Equipment, Affinity, Imprint and Entwine mechanics, and introduced the indestructible and modular keywords. Something that is or has indestructible can't be destroyed by damage or \\"destroy effects\\". In Darksteel, indestructible cards (all of which were artifacts) are made of the titular metal, though other things have been deemed indestructible when it became a common mechanic in later sets (similar to Double Strike, introduced in the Onslaught). Modular was a keyworded ability of artifact creatures, these creatures would come into play with a set number of counters and, upon the destruction of that creature, could transfer them to another artifact creature. Modular was part of a larger theme of charge counters on artifacts throughout the set. Fifth Dawn introduced the Sunburst and Scry mechanics. Artifacts with Sunburst get +1/+1 counters (if the card is a creature) or charge counters (if noncreature) for each color of mana used to pay the artifact's mana cost. \\"Scry X\\" means \\"Look at the top X cards of your library. Put any number of them on the bottom of your library and the rest on top in any order.\\" X was always 2 in Fifth Dawn, but other numbers were introduced when Scry was reprised for subsequent sets. Notable cards One notable cycle in Mirrodin was the cycle of artifact lands (, , , and ). These enhanced the power of cards with the \\"Affinity\\" mechanic by increasing the number of artifacts in play while still being considered lands. Due to abuse, they are banned or restricted in some formats. Other notable cards include and . Notable cards in Darksteel include , , , , , , , and . Notable cards in Fifth Dawn include , , and .

The Trust specialises in talking therapies. The education and training department caters for 2,000 students a year from the United Kingdom and abroad. The Trust is based at the Tavistock Centre in Swiss Cottage. The founding organisation was the Tavistock institute of medical psychology founded in 1920 by Dr. Hugh Crichton-Miller.Henderson, David. Ed. (2012) Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society, Cambridge Scholars Publishing. . pp. 5‚Äì18 It has long been regarded as a professional centre of excellence of international renown, in its application of psychoanalytic ideas to the study and treatment of mental health and interpersonal dynamics.Care Quality Commission recognises international reputation of the Clinic: http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/cqc-rates-tavistock-and-portman-nhs-foundation- trust-good The institution is notable for the great number of publications that have issued from it and its continuing engagement in a broad dialogue on the major social issues of the day.The Tavistock Library ‚Äì staff publications http://repository.tavistockandportman.ac.uk/view/subjects/ Its approaches have in the past been seen to be influential in the British Army, the English Prison Service, aspects of the judicial system, the Probation Service, in Education, Social Services, the National Health Service, in management consulting across industry and in the arts. Its signal attribute has been the multidisciplinary approach to its work. Threats to the Clinic's organisational and financial survival have surfaced from time to time. At one such juncture, in 1994, it joined forces with the neighbouring Portman Clinic in Fitzjohn's Avenue. The Portman specialises in areas of forensic psychiatry, including the treatment of addictive, sociopathic and criminal behaviours and tendencies.The Portman Clinic http://cindex.camden.gov.uk/kb5/camden/cd/service.page?id=dLDf6SNkX2c Early history Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury London, birthplace in 1920 of the eponymous Clinic. It owes its name to the fact that its original location was in Tavistock Square in central London. When it moved later to larger premises, it took its name with it. Although Hugh Crichton-Miller was a psychiatrist who developed psychological treatments for shell-shocked soldiers during and after the First World War, clinical services were always destined for both children and adults.Bourke, Joanna. (1996). Dismembering the Male: Men's Bodies, Britain and the Great War, Reaktion Press and University of Chicago Press. Dicks, H.V., (1970). 50 Years of the Tavistock Clinic. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. Reissued by Routledge, 2014, The clinic's first patient was a child. From its foundation it was also clear that to offer free treatment to all who need it meant that the Tavistock Clinic needed to generate income by providing training to clinical professionals who could eventually help people across the UK and beyond. The clinical staff were also researchers. These principles remain influential to this day. Carl Gustav Jung. Following its foundation the Tavistock Clinic developed a focus on preventive psychiatry, expertise in group relations ‚Äì including army officer selection ‚Äì social psychiatry, and action research. There was an openness to different streams of research and thought as for instance the famous series of lectures given by the Swiss psychiatrist and one time collaborator of Sigmund Freud, Dr. Carl Jung, which were attended by doctors, churchmen and members of the public, including H. G. Wells and Samuel Beckett. Its staff, who were still mainly unpaid honorary psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, were interested in researching and consulting to leadership within the armed forces. The staff also offered treatment to members of the civilian population who might be traumatised by the prospect of a further world war, which could bring bombing of cities, evacuation of children and the shocks of loss and bereavement. Post-war history After the Second World War, the Tavistock Clinic benefited from the Northfield Hospital experience and from the arrival of talented professionals from Europe, many fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1948 it became a leading clinic within the newly created National Health Service. At this point its education and training services were managed separately by the Tavistock Institute for Medical Psychology, which was also the umbrella for the Tavistock Institute, involved in social action research and thinking about group relations and organisational dynamics, and for work with marital couples. The clinic was managed on a democratic model by a professional committee and developed further its distinct focus on multi-disciplinary and community-centred work. =Children and young people= New developments in child and adolescent mental health were particularly fruitful in the immediate post-war period. In 1948 the creation of the children's department supported the development of training in child and adolescent psychotherapy. Dr John Bowlby supported this new training and naturalistic infant observation. He also developed Attachment Theory. Husband and wife clinicians James Robertson and Joyce Robertson showed in their film work the impact of separation in temporary substitute care on young children for example, when their parent was admitted to hospital. The Tavistock Clinic opened its Adolescent Department in 1959, recognising the distinctive developmental needs and difficulties of younger and older adolescents. In 1967 it absorbed the London Child Guidance Clinic, founded in 1929. In 1989 the Tavistock established the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), a highly specialised clinic for young people presenting with difficulties with their gender identity. =Training in education= By the 1960s The Tavistock Clinic was also providing both 1-year and 4-year professional training courses in educational psychology, the latter embracing a teacher training element through Leicester University School of Education. For a number of years the senior tutor and principal psychologist for these courses was Irene Caspari who did much to promote the concept and practice of Educational therapy. In the 1970s systemic psychotherapy became the Tavistock Clinic's newest professional training. Applications of the clinical ideas and skills of its multidisciplinary clinicians are at the heart of its education and training, with academically validated programmes developing from the early 1990s with the University of East London, and later with the University of Essex and Middlesex University. =Reflecting on the workplace= Work discussion, supervised clinical practice and experiential group relations work are central to many trainings all of which aim to equip mental health workers with the emotional, organisational, and relational capacities to operate confidently in front line settings. A BBC TV series 'Talking Cure: Jan' brought the work of the Clinic to a wider audience in 1999 and remains relevant today. Organisational consultancy by former CEO, Dr. Anton Obholzer, featured in the TV series, and their edited collection, with Vega Roberts, 'The Unconscious at Work: Individual and Organizational Stress in the Human Services', remains one of the classic texts to emerge from the Tavistock Clinic.Obholzer, Anton and Roberts, Vega Zagier. Eds. 1995. 'The Unconscious at Work: Individual and Organizational Stress in the Human Services'. London: Routledge, pp 224. =Public sphere= The Tavistock's tradition of social and political engagement has been renewed in recent years through its programme of Policy Seminars which model a dialogic, exploratory approach to policy analysis and debate with the social epidemiologist, Richard G. Wilkinson, the psychologist, Oliver James and the columnist, Polly Toynbee, among recent contributors. The series of Thinking Space events follows a similar model of participatory engagement around themes of diversity, racism, and sexual orientation. The Tavistock Institute, which had been part of the Tavistock family, moved to its own premises in 1994. The Tavistock Centre for Couples Relationships, TCCR, formerly the Tavistock Institute of Marital Studies, was always a separate, charitably-funded organisation which left the Tavistock Centre for new premises in 2009. NHS Trust In 1994, the Tavistock Clinic joined with the Portman Clinic to become the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. In 2006 the Trust acquired Foundation Trust status and become the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust. It is an active member of UCL Partners, the Academic Health Service Centre located in North London. Paul Burstow, former Coalition government health minister, became Chair of the Trust in November 2015. =Services= The Trust provides clinical services for children and families, young people and adults. It also provides multi- disciplinary training and education. These programmes include core professional training, for example in psychiatry, psychology, social work and advanced psychotherapy training, as well as applied programmes for anyone working in the mental health or social care workforce. Since 2010, the clinical work of the Trust has diversified with new services such as the Family Drug and Alcohol Court in Milton Keynes and the City and Hackney community psychotherapy service. It is the largest provider of transgender services in England, but funding for the service has not kept pace with demand. In August 2019, 5,717 people were on the waiting list for a first appointment, and average waiting time was about two years. The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock Centre has come under scrutiny due to reports that concerns over children's welfare were \\"shut down\\". The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust defended their practices. =Performance= It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 449 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 0.92%. 84% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 73% recommended it as a place to work. The Trust borrowed ¬£58 million in 2016 which it intends to repay by selling its current sites. Notable contributors to the clinic Over the years many hundreds of staff members, at all levels, have contributed to the work of this institution. This list is merely representative of some of the lasting contributors to the different fields encompassed by the Clinic. =Medical directors, chief executives and Chair of Trust= * Hugh Crichton-Miller 1920‚Äì1933 * John Rawlings Rees 1933‚Äì1947 * J.

However, with Jock Sutherland's return to Edinburgh in 1968, he became the catalyst for the formation of an organisation modelled on the London centre, albeit on a smaller scale. The Scottish Institute of Human Relations (SIHR), now defunct, was constituted as a charitable educational institution in Edinburgh in the early 1970s. Eventually a branch was opened in Glasgow. The 'MacTavi', as it was sometimes fondly called, worked closely with the National Health Service in Scotland and provided psychoanalytic training and courses for professionals in the health and educational systems and beyond.Hugh Moreton's witness statement at the Witness Seminar (2009) about the History of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 1960‚Äì1990 at Yorkhill Glasgow: p. 7. Retrieved 26 December 2016 It also guided adults and children into treatment for the forty years of its operation. Retrieved 14 November 2016 SIHR was finally dissolved in 2013 and its centres closed down. Some of its functions were taken over by a number of other organisations, specifically psychoanalytic training has become the remit of the Scottish Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy (SAPP).

He was a member of the Vardhana dynasty; and was the son of Prabhakarvardhana who defeated the Alchon Huna invaders,India: History, Religion, Vision and Contribution to the World, by Alexander P. Varghese p.26 and the younger brother of Rajyavardhana, a king of Thanesar, present-day Haryana. At the height of Harsha's power, his Empire covered much of North and Northwestern India, extended East till Kamarupa, and South until Narmada River; and eventually made Kannauj (in the present Uttar Pradesh state) his capital, and ruled till 647 CE.International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania by Trudy Ring, Robert M. Salkin, Sharon La Boda p.507 Harsha was defeated by the south Indian Emperor Pulakeshin II of the Chalukya dynasty in the Battle of Narmada when Harsha tried to expand his Empire into the southern peninsula of India.Ancient India by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar p.274 The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors from far and wide. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity. His biography Harshacharita (\\"Deeds of Harsha\\") written by Sanskrit poet Banabhatta, describes his association with Thanesar, besides mentioning the defence wall, a moat and the palace with a two-storied Dhavalagriha (white mansion).  Origins  Palace ruins at \\"Harsh ka tila\\" mound area spread over 1 km After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century, North India was split into several independent kingdoms. The northern and western regions of India passed into the hands of a dozen or more feudatory states. Prabhakara Vardhana, the ruler of Sthanvisvara, who belonged to the Vardhana family, extended his control over neighbouring states. Prabhakar Vardhana was the first king of the Vardhana dynasty with his capital at Thaneswar. After Prabhakar Vardhana's death in 605, his eldest son, Rajya Vardhana, ascended the throne. Harsha Vardhana was Rajya Vardhana's younger brother. This period of kings from the same line has been referred to as the Vardhana dynasty in many publications.Harsha Charitra by Banabhatt Legislative Elite in India: A Study in Political Socialization by Prabhu Datta Sharma, Publ. Legislators 1984, p32Revival of Buddhism in Modern India by Deodas Liluji Ramteke, Publ Deep & Deep, 1983, p19Some Aspects of Ancient Indian History and Culture by Upendra Thakur, Publ. Abhinav Publications, 1974, Sources suggest that Harsha belongs to Kshatriya Varna as described in Harshacharita written by Banabhatta. Xuanzang mentions an emperor named Shiladitya, who had been claimed to be Harsha. Xuanzang mentions that this king belonged to \\"Fei-she\\". This word is generally translated as Vaishya (a varna or social class). According to the, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´-m≈´la-kalpa, a 7-8th century CE Buddhist text, in the Imperial History of India by K.P Jayswal; Harsha was born of King Vishnu (vardhana) and his family were of Vaishya caste. They first became ministers, then Kings. The style vardhana seems to have been borrowed from their imperial ancestors. Ascension Harsha's sister Rajyashri had been married to the Makuhari king, Grahavarman. This king, some years later, had been defeated and killed by king Devagupta of Malwa and after his death, Rajyashri had been cast into prison by the victor. Harsha's brother, Rajya Vardhana, then the king at Thanesar, could not accept this affront on his family. So he marched against Devagupta and defeated him. However, Shashanka, king of Gauda in Eastern Bengal, then entered Magadha as a friend of Rajyavardhana, but in secret alliance with the Malwa king. Accordingly, Shashanka treacherously murdered Rajyavardhana. On hearing about the murder of his brother, Harsha resolved at once to march against the treacherous king of Gauda, but this campaign remained inconclusive and beyond a point, he turned back. Harsha ascended the throne at the age of 16. Reign As North India reverted to small republics and small monarchical states ruled by Gupta rulers after the fall of the prior Gupta Empire, Harsha united the small republics from Punjab to central India, and their representatives crowned him king at an assembly in April 606 giving him the title of Maharaja. Harsha established an empire that brought all of northern India under his control. The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors from far and wide. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the court of Harsha, and wrote a very favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity. Autograph of King Harsha. Pulakeshin II defeated Harsha on the banks of Narmada in the winter of 618‚Äì619. Pulakeshin entered into a treaty with Harsha, with the Narmada River designated as the border between the Chalukya Empire and that of Harshavardhana. Xuanzang describes the event thus: : \\"Shiladityaraja (i.e., Harsha), filled with confidence, marched at the head of his troops to contend with this prince (i.e., Pulakeshin); but he was unable to prevail upon or subjugate him\\". In 648, Tang dynasty emperor Tang Taizong sent Wang Xuance to India in response to Harsha having sent an ambassador to China. However once in India he discovered Harsha had died and the new king Aluonashun (supposedly ArunƒÅsva) attacked Wang and his 30 mounted subordinates. This led to Wang Xuance escaping to Tibet , also secured a reported Buddhist relic for China. He fought back to India with Tibet and Licchavi force, during the war, an apocryphal story written many centuries later, it's claimed that the new king was among the captives during Wang Xuance's attack.  Religion  \\"King Harsha pays homage to Buddha\\", a 20th- century artist's imagination Like many other ancient Indian rulers, Harsha was eclectic in his religious views and practices. His seals describe his ancestors as sun-worshippers, his elder brother as a Buddhist, and himself as a Shaivite. His land grant inscriptions describe him as Parama-maheshvara (supreme devotee of Shiva), and his play Nagananda is dedicated to Shiva's consort Gauri. His court poet Bana also describes him as a Shaivite. According to the Chinese Buddhist traveller Xuanzang, Harsha was a devout Buddhist. Xuanzang states that Harsha banned animal slaughter for food, and built monasteries at the places visited by Gautama Buddha. He erected several thousand 100-feet highs stupas on the banks of the Ganges River, and built well-maintained hospices for travellers and poor people on highways across India. He organized an annual assembly of global scholars and bestowed charitable alms on them. Every five years, he held a great assembly called Moksha. Xuanzang also describes a 21-day religious festival organized by Harsha in Kannauj; during this festival, Harsha and his subordinate kings performed daily rituals before a life-sized golden statue of the Buddha. Since Harsha's own records describe him as Shaivite, his conversion to Buddhism would have happened, if at all, in the latter part of his life. Even Xuanzang states that Harsha patronised scholars of all religions, not just Buddhist monks.  Literary Prowess  Harsha is widely believed to be the author of three Sanskrit plays Ratnavali, Nagananda and Priyadarsika. While some believe (e.g., Mammata in Kavyaprakasha) that it was Bana, Harsha's court poet who wrote the plays as a paid commission, Wendy Doniger is \\"persuaded, however, that king Harsha really wrote the plays ... himself.\\" See also * Surasena Kingdom * History of India * Bhaskar Varman References Further reading * Reddy, Krishna (2011), Indian History, Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, New Delhi * Price, Pamela (2007), Early Medieval India, HIS2172 - Periodic Evaluation, University of Oslo * \\"Conquests of Siladitya in the south\\" by S.

Candido, was a bassist and vocalist in Ted Fio Rito's big band, and they can be seen in a Soundie, \\"Ma, He's Making Eyes at Me\\". In 1933 he married Anita Bivona. Radio Candido's distinctive, four-octave speaking voice became familiar to radio listeners and moviegoers. Speaking his lines in his normal tenor, he would suddenly adopt a high, squeaky soprano and just as suddenly plunge into a gruff bass. His weekly repetition of \\"I'm feeling mighty low\\" on Jimmy Durante's radio show made it a national catchphrase. The running gag became so familiar that he recorded a song of the same title with Durante. The line can be heard in the 1950 Bugs Bunny cartoon Homeless Hare, although it was not spoken there by Candido. Voices Candido briefly but memorably was the voice of the \\"Angry Apple Tree\\" in The Wizard of Oz (1939), and provided the voice of a skeleton in Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion, and he later teamed with Bud Abbott during Abbott's attempted comeback in 1960. He was the voice of the bear in the Gentle Ben TV series, and he worked as a voice actor on animated films, notably for Walt Disney, where he portrayed the voice of the Indian Chief in Peter Pan, one of Maleficent's goons in Sleeping Beauty, the Captain of the Guard the crocodile in Robin Hood, the deep voiced prisoner in the Haunted Mansion attraction, and Fidget the peg-legged bat and a Reprobate in the Pub in The Great Mouse Detective.The New York Times Other animated films with Candido voices include Chuck Jones' adaptation of The Phantom Tollbooth, and the Ralph Bakshi movies Hey Good Lookin' and Heavy Traffic. Films His various credited and uncredited roles as an actor, bassist and vocalist in live-action films include Sadie McKee (1934), Roberta (1935), Only Angels Have Wings (1939), The Wizard of Oz (1939), Rhythm Parade (1942), Campus Rhythm (1943), Sarge Goes to College (1947), Smart Politics (1948) and The Great Rupert (1950).

He used the title of Labarna at the beginning of his reign. It is uncertain whether he is the second king so identified, making him Labarna II, or whether he is identical to Labarna I, who is treated as his predecessor in Hittite chronologies. During his reign, he moved the capital from Ne≈°a (Kane≈°, near modern K√ºltepe) to ·∏™attu≈°a (near modern Boƒüazkale), taking the throne name of ·∏™attu≈°ili to mark the occasion. He is the earliest Hittite ruler for whom contemporary records have been found. In addition to \\"King of ·∏™attu≈°a\\", he took the title \\"Man of Ku≈°≈°ara\\", a reference to the prehistoric capital and home of the Hittites, before they had occupied Ne≈°a. A cuneiform tablet found in 1957 written in both the Hittite and the Akkadian language provides details of six years of his reign. In it, he claims to have extended the Hittite domain to the sea, and in the second year, to have subdued Alalakh and other cities in Syria. In the third year, he campaigned against Arzawa in western Anatolia, then returned to Syria to spend the next three years retaking his former conquests from the Hurrians, who had occupied them in his absence. The end of his reign is of historical importance because of his Succession Proclamation.

He has published extensively on the land and marine temperature record and its consistency. In 2002, he was an organiser of a \\"Workshop on Advances in the Use of Historical Marine Climate Data\\". In 2004, he has published a paper in Nature, showing that the urban heat island effect has not affected the historical temperature record. In this article, Parker shares his observations of the minimum temperature over 24 hours worldwide since 1950 that were expressed as anomalies. Also it includes his reasoning to why urbanization has not systematically exaggerated the observed global warming trends in minimum temperature. He further goes on to mention how the criterion for ‚Äúcalm‚Äù was changed while the global trend for minimum temperature remained unchanged. From his analysis he finds that windy and calm nights warmed at the same rate. Both the windy and calm increased at a rate of (0.16 + 0.03 C). He compares his small sample of 26 stations in North America and Siberia with global trends from 1950 to 1953, covering over 5,000 stations. Estimates of recent global warming, supported by Parker‚Äôs analysis shows that urban warming has not introduced significant biases. ‚ÄúThe reality and magnitude of global- scale warming is supported by the near-equality of temperature trends on windy nights with trends based on all data.‚Äù (Parker) This paper has been commented on by Roger Pielke, Sr., et al.

Career  =Columnist= Lileks began his writing career as a columnist for the Minnesota Daily while he was a student at the University of Minnesota. After college, he wrote for City Pages, a Twin Cities alternative tabloid. He served as a general columnist for City Pages until 1988, when he was hired as a columnist for the St. Paul Pioneer Press. This led to a columnist job with Newhouse News Service and thence The Washington Post for a period in the early nineties. In the mid-nineties, Lileks returned to the Twin Cities for a job with the Star Tribune, retaining his Newhouse column until late 2006. The Star Tribune discontinued Lileks's column in 2007, eventually naming him editor of the now defunct community website buzz.mn. Lileks also writes a regular column (Athwart) for National Review. =Radio personality= Lileks's first foray into radio came in 1987, while he was a writer with City Pages. He became a regular guest on the Geoff Charles show, an afternoon talk show on KSTP. When Charles left the Twin Cities, Lileks filled the slot and served as an afternoon-drive host on KSTP for a time in the late eighties. In the mid-nineties, after returning from Washington DC, Lileks reappeared on KSTP with a new program, The Diner ‚Äì a show set in a fictional fifties-era diner. The show lasted several years on weekday evenings and then a few more as a weekend-evening program before leaving the air in the late nineties. As of October 23, 2013, The Diner was revived on Ricochet.com. In late 2006, The Diner was revived in podcast form. Selected original Diner programs and new original Diners are available on Lileks's website. Lileks is also a weekly guest on the Hugh Hewitt show, Pajamas Media's weekly PJM Political show on Sirius-XM Satellite Radio's POTUS channel, and a frequent guest and guest host on the Northern Alliance Radio Network program. Lileks has also been a monologist for the public affairs program Almanac, carried on Minnesota PBS television stations. =Website= Lileks's blog, the Daily Bleat, began in 1997. The Bleat covers many topics in his personal life (including his daughter Natalie (referred to as \\"Gnat\\" until she became old enough to object) and the family dog, Scout), politics from a conservative viewpoint, and cultural points of interest ranging from art and architecture to movies and music (one perennial topic is the Minnesota State Fair). Lileks's website also hosts a vast repository of vintage advertisements and other ephemera from the 1920s to the 1970s. =Other work= Lileks is a regular contributor to the social networking and blogging network Ricochet.com, and co-hosts the site's podcast with Rob Long and Peter Robinson.  Star Tribune controversy and resolution On May 7, 2007, Lileks announced that his home paper, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, was ending his column in the interest of budget cuts and putting him on a straight local news beat. The move, which was forced by cuts in other parts of the Star Tribunes newsroom, drew criticism from many, including Dave Barry. Mike Argento, president of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists, said in reaction to the news: > It's just a reflection of the sad state of the newspaper industry. Many of > the people running newspapers don't have a vision. They're concerned with > dollars and cents, and the bottom line. They should look at the future, not > just slash and burn. On June 5, 2007, the Star Tribune changed course and announced Lileks would serve as editor of buzz.mn, a community website.Ladies and gentlemen, I has a bucket., The Bleat, June 5, 2007.

A male Narwhal, whose tusk, as a Unicorn horn, was a common piece in cabinets. Cabinets of curiosities (also known in German loanwords as Kunstkabinett, Kunstkammer or Wunderkammer; also Cabinets of Wonder, and wonder-rooms) were collections of notable objects. The term cabinet originally described a room rather than a piece of furniture. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to natural history (sometimes faked), geology, ethnography, archaeology, religious or historical relics, works of art (including cabinet paintings), and antiquities. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. In addition to the most famous and best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of science in Europe formed collections that were precursors to museums. Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be \\"the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic,\\" or the less grandiose, \\"the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes.\\" Evans goes on to explain that \\"no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design\\". A corner of a cabinet, painted by Frans II Francken in 1636 reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era virtuoso might evince In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the Royal Society, whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of \\"learned entertainment,\\" or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions. Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was \\"a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the English Civil War and Interregum [sic].\\" This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which \\"[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.\\" A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as \\"something much more like a gentleman's club,\\" an idea supported by John Evelyn, who depicts the Royal Society as \\"an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty's Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.\\" History Fold-out engraving from Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale (Naples 1599), the earliest illustration of a natural history cabinet The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale (Naples 1599) (illustration, left). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his herbarium. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a studioloStudiolo: the small retreats in the palaces of Urbino and Gubbio were inlaid with intarsia that figured just such fitted cabinets with feigned lattice doors and shelves filled with scientific instruments, books and small sculptures in trompe-l'oeil perspective. The Gubbio studiolo has been reassembled at the Metropolitan Museum; the Urbino studiolo remains in situ. with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens.Sixteenth-century cabinet-makers serving the luxury trades of Florence and Antwerp were beginning to produce moveable cabinets with similar architectural interior fittings, which could be set upon a carpet-covered table or on a purpose-built stand. Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars. In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised Christian I of Saxony that three types of item were indispensable in forming a \\"Kunstkammer\\" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly \\"curious items from home or abroad\\"; and thirdly \\"antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals\\".B. Gutfleish and J. Menzhausen, \\"How a Kunstkammer Should Be Formed\\", Journal of the History of Collections, 1989 Vol I: p. 11. When Albrecht D√ºrer visited the Netherlands in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 48. The highly characteristic range of interests represented in Frans II Francken's painting of 1636 (illustration, above) shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene‚Äîa genre in itself‚Äîto a portrait and a religious picture (the Adoration of the Magi) intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely amber, which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing Libera, a Roman fertility goddess)Her base is inscribed LIBER[A] on the one hand and modern and religious (Christ at the ColumnIt appears to represent a reduction of a well-known sculpture by Alessandro Algardi.) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): portrait miniatures, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia chiaroscuro woodcuts or drawings, and a small still-life paintingStill life was considered a lesser genre than even portraits or landscapes. leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals‚Äîpresumably Greek and Roman‚Äîand Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl. Celestial globe with clockwork, made for the Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, 1579 The Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor (ruled 1576‚Äì1612), housed in the Hradschin at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplationThis is the secretive aspect emphasised by R. J. W. Evans, Rudolf II and His World: A Study in Intellectual History (Oxford) 1973. that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates.Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, \\"Remarks on the Collections of Rudolf II: The Kunstkammer as a Form of Representatio\\", Art Journal 38.1 (Autumn 1978:22‚Äì28). Rudolf's uncle, Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, also had a collection, organized by his treasurer, Leopold Heyperger, which put special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle in Austria. \\"The Kunstkammer was regarded as a microcosm or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction.\\"Francesaco Fiorani, reviewing Bredecamp 1995 in Renaissance Quarterly 51.1 (Spring 1998:268-270) p 268. Of Charles I of England's collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, \\"The Kunstkabinett itself was a form of propaganda.\\".Thomas, \\"Charles I of England: The tragedy of Absolutism\\", A.G. Dickens, ed. The Courts of Europe (London) 1977:201. Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of Ole Worm, known as Olaus Wormius (1588‚Äì1654) (illustration, above right), and Athanasius Kircher (1602‚Äì1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork automata; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently mythical creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a Scythian Lamb, a woolly fern thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the narwhal's tusk as coming from a whale rather than a unicorn, as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages. In the second half of the 18th century, Belsazar Hacquet (c. 1735‚Äì1815) operated in Ljubljana, then the capital of Carniola, a natural history cabinet () that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, Joseph II, the Russian grand duke Paul and Pope Pius VI, as well as by famous naturalists, such as and . It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the Idrija mine, a herbarium vivum with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an anatomical theatre. Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the Museum Wormianum (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more. Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many monarchs, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the Studiolo of Francesco I, the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. Frederick III of Denmark, who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the Kunstkamera founded by Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from Albertus Seba and Frederik Ruysch. The fabulous Habsburg Imperial collection included important Aztec artifacts, including the feather head-dress or crown of Montezuma now in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna. An early eighteenth- century German Schrank with a traditional display of corals (Naturkundenmuseum, Berlin) Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex Kunstschr√§nke produced in the early seventeenth century by the Augsburg merchant, diplomat and collector Philipp Hainhofer. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1632, which is kept in the Museum Gustavianum in Uppsala. The curio cabinet, as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples. The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality. A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the \\"Green Vaults\\" formed by Augustus the Strong in Dresden to display his chamber of wonders. The \\"Enlightenment Gallery\\" in the British Museum, installed in the former \\"Kings Library\\" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world. In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a cabinet came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of virt√π or curiosities, such as a virtuoso would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, Michael Bernhard Valentini published an early museological work, Museum Museorum, an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents. Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial freak shows and sideshows. =England= The richly decorated vault of the Studiolo of Francesco I in Palazzo Vecchio, Florence In 1671, when visiting Thomas Browne (1605-82), the courier John Evelyn remarked, His whole house and garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarities and that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things. Diary of John Evelyn entry dated 17th October 1671 Late in his life Browne parodied the rising trend of collecting curiosities in his tract Musaeum Clausum an inventory of dubious, rumoured and non-existent books, pictures and objects. Sir Hans Sloane (1660‚Äì1753) an English physician, member of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Physicians, and the founder of the British Museum in London began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the Duke of Albemarle offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and enslaved African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, Natural History of Jamaica, published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g., snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.Alexander, Edward P.

Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. Herman Boerhaave gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased Leonard Plukenet's collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630‚Äì1715), left him a twelve- volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend Adam Buddle gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and James Petiver's virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. Mark Catesby gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. Philip Miller gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the Chelsea Physic Garden.Alexander, Edward P.

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica. \\"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain James Cook in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the British Empire.\\"Alexander, Edward P.

Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for ¬£20,000. In 1759, George II's royal library was added to Sloane's collection to form the foundation of the British Museum. Italian Baroque-era cabinet of curiosities, circa 1635. John Tradescant the elder (circa 1570s‚Äì1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, John Tradescant the younger (1608‚Äì1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to Powhatan, father of Pocahontas. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g., the dodo from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g., wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g., a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.Ivins, Jr., William M. \\"The Tradescant Collection\\", in The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Vol. 20, No. 8 (August 1925), 194‚Äì197; Josten, C.H.

Strange Blooms: The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants, (London: Atlantic, 2006) Elias Ashmole (1617‚Äì1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, Freemason, and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in astrology, alchemy, and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of Musaeum Tradescantianum, a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the University of Oxford, provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole's donation formed the foundation of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at Snowshill Manor and Wallington Hall. The concept has been reinterpreted at The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History. =United States= Thomas Dent Mutter (1811‚Äì1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to M√ºtter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. M√ºtter's collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The M√ºtter Museum began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including Benjamin Rush's medical chest and Florence Nightingale's sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, Joseph Hyrtl (1810‚Äì1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the \\"soap lady\\"; the conjoined liver and death cast of Chang and Eng Bunker, the Siamese twins; and in 1893, Grover Cleveland's jaw tumor. The M√ºtter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities. P. T. Barnum established Barnum's American Museum on five floors in New York, \\"perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs‚ÄîBarnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, \\"THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!\\" at the exit door\\".\\"Catalog of Curiosities\\" by BARRYMORE LAURENCE SCHERER Wall Street Journal. January 1, 2013. In 1908, New York businessmen formed the Hobby Club, a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their \\"cabinets of wonder\\" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and incunable; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.According to its constitution, \\"This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects.\\"Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912‚Äì1920.

In Los Angeles, the modern-day Museum of Jurassic Technology anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused.The American writer Lawrence Weschler, wrote an entire book about the museum: Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology (1996) In Spring Green, Wisconsin, the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as House on the Rock, can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In Bristol, Rhode Island, Mus√©e Patam√©canique is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by Pataphysics. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, Cabinet magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association WunderkamernWunderkammern uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how \\"amazement\\" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called \\"Wunder Kammer\\", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.wunder-kamer.com Several internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as YouTube as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions \\"just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century.\\" See also * Antiquarian * Holophusikon * Found objects * Medical oddities * Museum  References  Further reading * Under the Sign: John Bargrave as Collector, Traveler, and Witness, Stephen Bann, Michigan, 1995 * The Origins of Museums: The Cabinet of Curiosities in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe, ed.

He led the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and wrote the Stroop Report, a book-length account of the operation. Following the defeat of Germany, Stroop was prosecuted during the Dachau Trials and convicted of murdering nine US prisoners of war. After his extradition to Poland, Stroop was tried, convicted, and executed for crimes against humanity. Early life Josef Stroop (he later changed his forename) was born in the Principality of Lippe, in the German Empire. His father, Konrad Stroop, was Lippe's chief of police. His mother, Katherine, was a homemaker. In a conversation with Kazimierz Moczarski while imprisoned in 1949, Stroop recalled his devoutly religious Roman Catholic mother as \\"a near fanatic\\",Moczarski (1981), Conversations with an Executioner, Prentice Hall, p. 10. who subjected him to childhood physical abuse.Moczarski (1981), p. 13. Both of his parents were enthusiastic monarchists. During parades in Detmold, Konrad Stroop often pointed out Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe and said, \\"Remember this always. This is our Prince. Obey him and serve him as I have.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 14. Young Josef's sense of German patriotism was fostered by growing up in the shadow of the Hermannsdenkmal.Moczarski (1981), pp. 14-15. Stroop enlisted in the Prussian Army in 1914 and served in several infantry regiments along the Western Front. He was wounded in action near La Bass√©e in October 1914.Moczarski (1981), p. 20. To the outrage of his devout mother, Stroop married Katharina, the daughter of a minister from the Protestant Church of Lippe, on 3 July 1923.Moczarski (1981), p. 31. Katharina Stroop remained a loyal and obedient wife despite her husband's many infidelities.Moczarski (1981), p. 58, 60. Their marriage produced a daughter, Renate Stroop, who was born in February, 1928. Their son, Olaf Stroop, was born in February 1936.Moczarski (1981), p. 60. During the early 1920s, Stroop joined the Tannenbergbund and embraced Germanic neo-paganism under the influence of General Erich Ludendorff and his wife Mathilde. He later recalled that Mathilde Ludendorff revealed \\"the truth about the Catholic Church in Germany and returned us to the true Germanic gods. By recalling the pure, pre- Germanic ways, she pointed out the rottenness of the Judeo-Christian ethic and showed how the organized Church had been strangling the Reich for twelve hundred years.\\" Stroop further recalled, \\"It was thanks to what I was lucky enough to learn from her books that I was able to rid myself of religious prejudice and mark Gottgl√§ubig in the column concerning belief.\\"Kazimierz Moczarski (1981), pp. 33‚Äì34. In another conversation with Moczarski, Stroop called Catholicism \\"a catch-all of religions, infected with Judaism.\\"Moczarski (1981), pp. 57‚Äì58. He further claimed that Christianity was created as a Jewish conspiracy for \\"the weakening and debasement of man through guilt.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 58. SS career Stroop joined the Nazi Party and SS in 1932. In 1933, he was appointed leader of the state auxiliary police. One year later, he was promoted from the rank of SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer to SS- Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. Subsequently, he worked for the SS administration in M√ºnster and Hamburg. Cardinal, Count Clemens von Galen. In 1934, Bishop Clemens von Galen of M√ºnster attacked the racist ideologies of the new regime, partly poking fun at it, partly critiquing its ideological basis as published by Alfred Rosenberg. He declared it unacceptable to refuse the Old Testament because of its Jewish authorship, and to limit morality and virtue to the perceived usefulness of a particular race.Rudolf Morsey, Clemens August Kardinal von Galen ‚Äì Bisch√∂fliches Wirken in der Zeit der Hitler-Herrschaft. Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung, D√ºsseldorf 1987, p. 14. In retaliation, Stroop and a von Galen family member of the SS made an official visit to the Bishop. Both were instructed to pressure the Bishop into approving Rosenberg's doctrines. If he refused, they were ordered to threaten him with the confiscation of Church property and an anti-Catholic propaganda campaign.Kazimierz Moczarski (1981), p. 56. The visit began well, with the bishop commending Stroop's mother for her devout Catholicism and charitable work in Detmold. However, the Bishop turned the tables on his two visitors. He categorically refused to accept or praise Rosenberg's doctrines of euthanizing or forcibly sterilizing the disabled. To Stroop's further shock, the Bishop denounced the Nazis for trying to introduce Germanic neo-paganism into his diocese. He scoffed at marriage ceremonies and funerals conducted before altars dedicated to Wotan. Stroop, who attended such a ceremony only days before, was stunned that the bishop had learned of it so quickly.Moczarski (1981), pp. 56-57. At the end of the meeting, he stated the Church would remain loyal to the State in all lawful matters. He expressed his deep love for Germany and reminded them he was the first Catholic Bishop to publicly acknowledge the new regime.Moczarski (1981), pp. 56-57. Stroop lamented the fact that von Galen's German patriotism \\"was tainted by Papist ideals, harmful to Germany for centuries. Besides, the Archbishop's orders came from outside the Fatherland, a fact which disturbed us. We all know, despite its diverse factions, the Catholic Church is a world community, which sticks together when the chips are down.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 57. In September 1938, Stroop was promoted again, this time to the rank of SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel), and served near Reichenberg (Liberec), in the Sudetenland. In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop happily reminisced about his many visits to the hot springs at Karlsbad. For this reason, their cellmate, Gustav Schielke, expressed disgust, instead of serving in combat, \\"Herr General did battle in spas.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 82. =Early World War II= After the German invasion of Poland, Stroop served as commander of the SS section in Gnesen (Gniezno). During the occupation of Poland, Stroop was transferred to Pozna≈Ñ as head of Selbstschutz, the notorious \\"self-defense\\" formation of the local ethnic Germans. In May 1941, Stroop changed his forename from Josef to J√ºrgen for ideological reasons and in honor of his dead infant son. From 7 July to 15 September 1941, Stroop served in combat on the Eastern Front in the SS Division Totenkopf. He was awarded an Iron Cross 2nd Class. On 16 September 1942, he was promoted to SS-Brigadef√ºhrer and assigned as an Inspector of the SiPo and SD of the Higher SS and Police Leader for Russia South. Beginning October 1942, Stroop commanded an SS garrison at Kherson, before becoming the SS and Police Leader (SSPF) for Lemberg (Lviv) in February 1943. Stroop was SS inspector of Durchgangsstrasse IV, a large forced labor project to built a road from Lemberg to Stalino (now Donetsk). =Suppression of the Warsaw ghetto uprising= J√ºrgen Stroop (center, in a field cap) with his men in the burning of Warsaw Ghetto, 1943 Stroop was involved in the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, an action which cost the lives of over 50,000 people. He was sent to Warsaw on 17 April 1943 by Heinrich Himmler, as a replacement for SS-Oberf√ºhrer Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, who was relieved of duty.Moshe Arens, Who Defended The Warsaw Ghetto? (The Jerusalem Post)Jurgen Stroop Diary, including The Stroop Report: Table of Contents (Jewish Virtual Library) Stroop took over from Sammern-Frankenegg following the latter's failure to suppress the uprising at the onset.Jewish Virtual Library, Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg Source: Danny Dor (Ed.), Brave and Desperate. Israel Ghetto Fighters, 2003, p. 166. He commented to war crimes investigators: Stroop ordered the entire Ghetto to be systematically burned- down and blown-up, building-by-building. All of the survivors, including men, women, and children were either killed on the spot or deported to extermination camps. In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop described the destruction of the Ghetto in great detail. Stroop also disclosed, unlike the men under his command, he always left the Ghetto at mealtimes and overnight. well-known photograph showing the clearing of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943. In his daily report 1 May 1943 Stroop reported: \\"Progress of large scale operation on 1 May 1943. Start 0900 hours. 10 searching parties were detailed, moreover a larger battle group was detailed to comb out a certain block of buildings, with the added instruction to burn that block down. Within this block of buildings there existed a so-called armament factory which had not yet been entirely evacuated, although it had had enough time to do so. It was not exempted from the operation. Today's operation a total of 1,026 Jews were caught, of whom 245 were killed, either in battle or while resisting. Moreover, a considerable number of bandits and ringleaders were also caught. In one case a Jew who had already been made ready for transport fired three shots against a 1st Lieutenant of Police, but missed his mark...\\". Stroop recalled this shooting episode (quoted in the book Conversations with an Executioner by Kazimierz Moczarski): Stroop expressed confusion that the Ghetto's Jewish combatants, whom he viewed as Untermenschen, fought effectively against his men.Moczarski (1981), p. 148. =SS and Police Leader of Warsaw= Great Synagogue of Warsaw, c. 1910 After the suppression, Stroop ordered the destruction of Warsaw's Great Synagogue 16 May 1943. Stroop's description was quoted in Conversations with an Executioner: At that point, Stroop assumed the position of SS and Police Leader of Warsaw. Kr√ºger presented an Iron Cross 1st Class to him on 18 June 1943 for the Warsaw Ghetto \\"action\\" at a gala reception in Warsaw's ≈Åazienki Park. Stroop's detailed 75-page report on the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was bound in black leather. It included copies of all communiqu√©s sent to SS Police Leader East Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr√ºger and many photographs. Titled The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw is no more!, it would later be used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. =Occupied Greece= In September 1943, Stroop was named the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF) in Greece. On 16 October, the government of Ioannis Rallis published a decree which put the Security Battalions, Hellenic Gendarmerie and City Police under Stroop's orders.Gasparinatos (2015), pp. 112-113, 261. The local civilian administration found his methods and behavior unacceptable, and withdrew cooperation, forbidding the local Order Police from having anything to do with him, which made his position untenable. Consequently, he was removed and replaced by Walter Schimana, and on 9 November, was appointed Commander of SS- Oberabschnitt Rhein-Westmark (an SS administrative district named for the Rhine and Gau Westmark) in Wiesbaden, serving there until the close of the war. =Plot of 20 July 1944= The conference room at the Wolf's Lair after Claus von Stauffenberg's attempt on Hitler's life According to Moczarski, no subject enraged Stroop more than the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler. Whenever the subject came up, Stroop cursed those involved, \\"in unprintable terms,\\" as a \\"murderous band of generals and Jew-ridden civilians.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 220. Stroop blamed Germany's defeat on Germans: \\"A few weaklings poisoned by enemy agents and infected with subversive ideologies were all it took to undermine us. The minute we suffered military defeats, the cancerous elements in our society swung into action, organizing Mafias and creating 'patriotic discussion groups.' In the end, they destroyed our nation.\\" Stroop proudly related his involvement in the purge of anti-Nazi Germans following the plot's failure. He expressed annoyance Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was allowed to commit suicide rather than being hanged from a meat hook.Moczarski (1981), p. 222. He also praised Roland Freisler of the Volksgerichtshof as \\"a fine judge.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 224. Stroop also boasted about his participation in dealing with Field Marshal G√ºnther von Kluge for his involvement in the plot. As General Wilhelm Burgdorf did with Rommel, Stroop claimed to have offered the Field Marshal a choice between suicide and a show trial before Judge Freisler. To Stroop's outrage, Kluge demanded his day in court. Stroop then claimed he shot Kluge in the head. Himmler announced the Field Marshal was a suicide.Moczarski (1981), pp. 226‚Äì234. =Murder of US prisoners of war= Between October 1944 and March 1945, nine troops of the United States Army Air Forces were summarily executed after they were shot down and captured in Stroop's district. They were Sergeant Willard P. Perry, Sergeant Robert W. Garrison, Private Ray R. Herman, Second Lieutenant William A. Duke, Second Lieutenant Archibald B. Monroe, Private Jimmie R. Heathman, Lieutenant William H. Forman, and Private Robert T. McDonald.Moczarski (1981), pp. 276-277.List of Allied POWS killed after capture After Moczarski reminded him the killing of POWs was defined as criminal under the Hague and Geneva Conventions, Stroop responded, \\"It was common knowledge American flyers were terrorists and murderers who used methods contrary to civilized norms ... We were given a statement to that effect from the highest authorities. It was accompanied by an order from Heinrich Himmler.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 250. As a result, he explained, all nine POWs were taken to the forest and given \\"a ration of lead for their American necks.\\"Moczarski (1981), pp. 251-252. =End of the war= In late March 1945, Stroop was forced to retreat from Wiesbaden as the advancing U.S. Army crossed the Rhine bridgeheads. Upon his arrival in Pottenstein, Bavaria, Stroop received word Heinrich Himmler wished to meet him in Berlin. On 14 April, Stroop met Himmler in his private train near Prenzlau. With a pass signed by Himmler, Stroop traveled to the Alpine Redoubt with a group of teenaged Hitler Youth members he was training for war. To obtain gasoline and other scarce supplies, Stroop showed Himmler's signed order and claimed to be transporting his Werwolf unit to build an Alpine bastion for the salvation of the Reich. However, after a secret conference at Taxenbach, Austria, Stroop and his fellow Werwolf commanders decided to change into Wehrmacht uniforms and surrender to the Western Allies. Soon after, Stroop abandoned his Werwolf unit near Kufstein and fled north.Moczarski (1981), pp. 243-244. On 10 May 1945, Stroop surrendered to the American forcesMoczarski (1981), p. 248. in the village of Rottau, Bavaria.Moczarski (1981), p. 244. Stroop told Moczarski he was carrying a cyanide tablet, which he intended to take if captured. After Moczarski asked him his reasons for not taking it, Stroop replied, \\"It's really quite simple. I was afraid.\\"Moczarski (1981), p. 246. At the time he surrendered, Stroop carried forged discharge papers made out to a Wehrmacht Captain of Reserve Josef Straup. He kept to this story for nearly two months, before admitting his identity on 2 July 1945. Trial at Dachau Judicial Bench, Dachau Trials. In the case of U.S. vs. Jurgen Stroop, et al, the former General and his subordinates were prosecuted by the U.S. Military Tribunal at Dachau for the \\"liquidation\\" of the nine U.S. POWs executed in his district.Moczarski (1981), pp. 248-256. Lieutenant Colonel William Dwinnel, a U.S. Army lawyer from Brooklyn, New York appeared for the prosecution. Brigadier General Emil C. Kiel of the United States Army Air Forces was assigned as the trial's judge. Stroop later called General Kiel \\"a cunning devil,\\" and expressed a belief the General was a Jew.Moczarski (1981), p. 249. In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop lamented, \\"Nearly all of those judges were Jews or Freemasons. I studied them very closely. Most of them had dark hair.\\" He further lamented one of his U.S. Army defense lawyers was wearing a Masonic ring in court. According to Gustav Schielke, his cellmate, > Stroop behaved like a swine in the dock. He acted innocent as a lamb, > pretending the killings were news to him. Because of his incriminations, > several fellow defendants were sentenced to death, as many as thirteen of > the twenty-two. As senior commander of the SS and police, he gave all the > orders, Herr Moczarski, yet he stated in court his underlings killed the > American airmen. How could a top German officer act like that?Moczarski > (1981), p. 253. After an eight-week trial, Brigadier General Kiel sentenced Stroop to death by hanging on 21 March 1947. In November 1947, a death warrant was signed by General Lucius D. Clay. By then, however, Stroop was imprisoned in Warsaw for five months. In late May 1947, Stroop was flown to Berlin-Tempelhof Airport, and extradited to the People's Republic of Poland. He recalled, \\"My heart sank when I saw those Polish officers at Tempelhof. So, the Americans were liars after all! They promised me time and again I'd never be given to the Communists and my death sentence for killing the U.S. airmen would be commuted to life imprisonment.\\"Moczarski(1981), Conversations with an Executioner, p. 258. Trial in Warsaw and execution Stroop before a Polish court in 1951 Stroop's trial began on 18 July 1951 at the Warsaw Criminal District Court and lasted three days. Stroop stood accused of four crimes: :1. Belonging to the SS, a criminal organization. :2. Liquidating the Warsaw Ghetto, leading to the murder of more than 50,000 people and deporting hundreds of thousands of other Jews to the death camps. :3. Ordering the shooting of one hundred Poles on 16 July 1943. :4. Participating in the mass murder of Polish civilians in the Warthegau.Moczarski (1981), p. 264. On 23 July 1951, the Court sentenced Stroop and Franz Konrad to death by hanging. In passing sentence, the Court declared, > Since the character and magnitude of Stroop's crimes, his attitude and his > twisted explanations not only indicate a total lack of repentance but > actually confirm that he retains his Nazi view of the world, the Court is > unable to find the slightest extenuating circumstance in the accused > Stroop's conduct. His actions show that he is a being devoid of human > feeling, a Fascist hangman who tracked his victims with cold and relentless > cruelty, an executioner who must be removed from the society of > man.Moczarski (1981), p. 265. Warsaw's Mokot√≥w Prison in 2007 Stroop was hanged at Mokot√≥w Prison at seven o'clock in the evening on 6 March 1952. In 1961, Moczarski wrote to the Procurator General of the Polish Republic and received a letter about Stroop's last moments. According to the Procurator's letter, Stroop was calm, \\"exhibiting his usual arrogance\\", in the day before his hanging. He expressed no \\"last wish\\". Several days before the hanging, the prison director asked Stroop whether he could reconcile his conscience with the fact he murdered women and children in the Ghetto and watched others do so at his orders; he replied he felt no guilt about killing Jews. Stroop did not utter a word about Germany, Hitler, or future revenge.Moczarski (1981), p. 266.  Conversations with an Executioner  Kazimierz Moczarski (1907‚Äì1975) While awaiting trial in Warsaw's Mokot√≥w Prison, Stroop spent 255 days in a cell with Kazimierz Moczarski, a former officer in the pre-war Polish Army. Moczarski, under the codename Maurycy, served in Poland's anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet resistance movement, the Armia Krajowa (AK) in World War II. By the time they met, he was incarcerated for more than three years after communist judges sentenced him on 18 January 1946. Moczarski was ordered by the AK to assassinate Stroop for crimes against the Polish Nation during his tenure as SS and Police Leader of Warsaw. Due to the unpredictability of Stroop's movements, Moczarski was unable to carry out the mission.Moczarski (1981), pp. 182-184. Following the Soviet-led transformation of Poland into a Marxist-Leninist police state, Moczarski was arrested and tortured by the Polish Ministry of State Security,Stephane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999. Pages 377-378. spending four years on death row before his release in 1956. During their incarceration, Stroop opened-up in detail about his life. He also shared with Moczarski his letters from his mother, wife, and children in West Germany. Moczarski recalled: \\"The letters from his mother Stroop gave me to read ... seemed to indicate Frau Stroop did not view as crimes the acts for which Stroop is jailed.\\" Moczarski collected notes and wrote a memoir about his 255-day incarceration from 2 March 1949 until 11 November 1949 in one cell with J√ºrgen Stroop after his release from prison and re-habilitation in 1956 during the anti-Stalinist Polish October.Andrzej Szczypiorski (1977), Moczarski Kazimierz, Rozmowy z katem text with Notes and Biography by Andrzej Krzysztof Kunert (PDF 1.86 MB, available from Scribd.com).

The current companies also include subsidiaries Nosler Custom and Nosler Reloading. Nosler's contributions to shooting sports include both polymer-tipped bullet designs and new manufacturing techniques used in their production. Early history John Amos Nosler was born on 4 April 1913 in Brawley, California. While hunting moose in British Columbia in 1946, the bullets he was using failed to penetrate deeply enough to reach vital organs and kill the animal quickly.Aaron Carter \\"John A. Nosler\\" American Rifleman January 2011 pp. 38‚Äì39 At the time, most jacketed bullets employed a single copper alloy envelope (the jacket) around a single lead alloy core. The jacket on most military bullets was closed in front and opened at the base. These full metal jacket bullets offered good penetration, but often failed to expand and passed completely through an animal leaving a comparatively small wound. Soft-point hunting bullets like Nosler was using had the jacket applied in the opposite direction to completely cover the base, but open at the nose. These bullets would expand to leave a large wound channel, but sometimes broke into small pieces with inadequate momentum to overcome resistance of moving through bone or muscle tissue. The experience inspired Nosler to develop a new bullet design, intended to expand readily at low impact velocities yet maintain integrity at high impact velocities (see terminal ballistics). These Nosler Partition bullets used a specially designed jacket enclosing two separate lead alloy cores. The front core was open on the nose to expand easily, but expansion would stop at the partition (which was a solid layer of copper extending right across the bullet, not just the thin shell of copper which composed the jacket). The portion of the bullet behind the partition has the structural integrity of a full metal jacket bullet, but the expanded forward jacket leaves a larger wound channel. Bullets were originally manufactured for personal use, using hand made, lathe turned jackets. In 1948 Nosler began to sell the partition bullets commercially, forming Nosler, Inc. Further innovations by Nosler included new techniques of manufacturing bullet jackets that yielded more consistent expansion, better core bonding techniques to prevent separation of the lead core from the copper jacket, and the plastic Ballistic Tip (polymer nose cone) used to provide hollow point bullets a streamlined shape of boat tail Spitzer bullets. The Nosler Ballistic Tip design has been copied by other manufacturers, such as the V-Max, ELD and A-Tip (aluminum tip) series bullets by Hornady. John Nosler sold the production facilities to his son in 1988, and died at his home in Bend, Oregon on 10 October 2010. Company Information Today, Nosler makes a number of different hunting bullets for rifle, handgun, and muzzle-loaders. They also manufacture brass and sell loaded ammunition, and Nosler Custom has recently begun to sell limited edition and semi-custom hunting rifles. The original Partition design bullet still is the company's flagship product. It has undergone many refinements over the years, but the basic design concept has remained unchanged. Company News Nosler experienced a massive explosion at their plant in Bend, Oregon on 2 June 2010. No one was harmed in the blast.KTVZ report on Nosler Explosion In February 2015, Nosler announced plans to expand their long-standing operations in Bend, Oregon to their neighboring city of Redmond, where the company purchased 60 acres of undeveloped land in December 2014. Construction of a 30,000 sq. ft. building is planned for completion in 2016 and will house Nosler's growing ammunition and cartridge brass operations, including the manufacturing of their SSA by Nosler product line based on the company's acquisition of Silver State Armory in 2013. The expansion is expected to add approximately 20 jobs in Central Oregon and will allow the original Bend plant to focus exclusively on bullet production. Company Developments In 2006 Nosler announced its very first rifle offering, the Model 48 Trophy Grade. Nosler announced the company's first proprietary cartridge, the 26 Nosler, as the world's most powerful 6.5mm cartridge commercially available during SHOT Show in January 2014. In January 2015, Nosler introduced the company's second cartridge, the 28 Nosler, a 7mm rifle cartridge based on the 26 Nosler case. Since their release, the 26 Nosler and 28 Nosler have been known for high muzzle velocities and extremely flat trajectories. The parent case for both cartridges is based on the .300 Remington Ultra Magnumhttps://randyscustomrifles.com/812-2/ case. In October 2014, Nosler introduced Ballistic Tip Ammunition as the latest product offering in their factory loaded ammunition. The ammunition is loaded exclusively with Nosler's line of Ballistic Tip hunting bullets, a polymer- tipped projectile made popular by the company when introduced in 1984 as a premium choice for hunting medium-sized game such as deer, antelope and wild hogs. The Ballistic Tip Ammunition line pairs the performance of the Ballistic Tip projectile with Nosler's own component brass. Late 2014 Nosler revamped the Model 48 line. It did away with the Trophy Grade Rifle and replaced it with the Patriot Rifle. The new rifle has a Basix trigger and Bell and Carlson stock. For the most accuracy out of the Patriot, Nosler incorporated an aluminum bedding chassis into the aramid-fiber reinforced carbon fiber stock, and the barrel is free-floated. The stock is a hand laid-up laminate that is elephant gray with black epoxy webbed over the surface. Which means it's never going to warp or crack. The comb is straight with a pancake cheekpiece and a thick, solid pistol grip. The Patriot rifle chambered in .26 Nosler should be an effective hunting combination from the mountains to the prairies. Early 2016 Nosler introduced its third cartridge the .30 Nosler. October 2016 Nosler introduces a new line of Competition / Target Bullets - RDF Bullets October 2016 Nosler introduces the .33 Nosler January 2017 Nosler introduced the .22 Nosler.

HEK 293 cells have been widely used in cell biology research for many years, because of their reliable growth and propensity for transfection. They are also used by the biotechnology industry to produce therapeutic proteins and viruses for gene therapy.  History  293FT cells, a variation of 293 cell HEK 293 cells were generated in 1973 by transfection of cultures of normal human embryonic kidney cells with sheared adenovirus 5 DNA in Alex van der Eb's laboratory in Leiden, the Netherlands. The cells were obtained from a single, apparently healthy, spontaneously or, under Dutch law, legally aborted fetus; the identity of the parents and the reason for the abortion are unknown. The cells were cultured by van der Eb; the transfection by adenovirus was performed by Frank Graham, a post-doc in van der Eb's lab. They were published in 1977 after Graham left Leiden for McMaster University. They are called HEK since they originated in human embryonic kidney cultures, while the number 293 came from Graham's habit of numbering his experiments; the original HEK 293 cell clone was from his 293rd experiment. Graham performed the transfection a total of eight times, obtaining just one clone of cells that were cultured for several months. After presumably adapting to tissue culture, cells from this clone developed into the relatively stable HEK 293 line. Subsequent analysis has shown that the transformation was brought about by inserting ~4.5 kilobases from the left arm of the viral genome, which became incorporated into human chromosome 19. For many years it was assumed that HEK 293 cells were generated by transformation of either a fibroblastic, endothelial or epithelial cell, all of which are abundant in kidneys. However, the original adenovirus transformation was inefficient, suggesting that the cell that finally produced the HEK 293 line may have been unusual in some fashion. Graham and coworkers provided evidence that HEK 293 cells and other human cell lines generated by adenovirus transformation of human embryonic kidney cells have many properties of immature neurons, suggesting that the adenovirus preferentially transformed a neuronal lineage cell in the original kidney culture. A comprehensive study of the genomes and transcriptomes of HEK 293 and five derivative cell lines compared the HEK 293 transcriptome with that of human kidney, adrenal, pituitary and central nervous tissue. The HEK 293 pattern most closely resembled that of adrenal cells, which have many neuronal properties. Given the location of the adrenal gland (adrenal means \\"next to the kidney\\"), a few adrenal cells could plausibly have appeared in an embryonic kidney derived culture, and could be preferentially transformed by adenovirus. Adenoviruses transform neuronal lineage cells much more efficiently than typical human kidney epithelial cells. An embryonic adrenal precursor cell therefore seems the most likely origin cell of the HEK 293 line. As a consequence, HEK 293 cells should not be used as an in vitro model of typical kidney cells. HEK 293 cells have a complex karyotype, exhibiting two or more copies of each chromosome and with a modal chromosome number of 64. They are described as hypotriploid, containing less than three times the number of chromosomes of a haploid human gamete. Chromosomal abnormalities include a total of three copies of the X chromosome and four copies of chromosome 17 and chromosome 22. The presence of multiple X chromosomes and the lack of any trace of Y chromosome derived sequence suggest that the source fetus was female.  Variants  Multiple variants of HEK 293 have been reported. * HEK 293F * HEK 293FT * HEK 293T * HEK 293S * HEK 293FTM * HEK 293SG * HEK 293SGGD * HEK 293H * HEK 293E * HEK EBNA1-6E * HEK 293MSR * HEK 293A  Applications  Immunofluorescent HEK 293 cells HEK 293 cells are straightforward to grow in culture and to transfect. They have been used as hosts for gene expression. Typically, these experiments involve transfecting in a gene (or combination of genes) of interest, and then analyzing the expressed protein. The widespread use of this cell line is due to its transfectability by the various techniques, including calcium phosphate method, achieving efficiencies approaching 100%. Examples of such experiments include: * Effects of a drug on sodium channels * Inducible RNA interference system * Isoform-selective protein kinase C agonist * Interaction between two proteins * Nuclear export signal in a protein A more specific use of HEK 293 cells is in the propagation of adenoviral vectors. Viruses offer an efficient means of delivering genes into cells, which they evolved to do, and are thus of great use as experimental tools. However, as pathogens, they also present a risk to the experimenter. This danger can be avoided by the use of viruses which lack key genes, and which are thus unable to replicate after entering a cell. In order to propagate such viral vectors, a cell line that expresses the missing genes is required. Since HEK 293 cells express a number of adenoviral genes, they can be used to propagate adenoviral vectors in which these genes (typically, E1 and E3) are deleted, such as AdEasy. An important variant of this cell line is the 293T cell line. It contains the SV40 large T-antigen that allows for episomal replication of transfected plasmids containing the SV40 origin of replication. This allows for amplification of transfected plasmids and extended temporal expression of desired gene products. HEK 293, and especially HEK 293T, cells are commonly used for the production of various retroviral vectors. Various retroviral packaging cell lines are also based on these cells.  Native proteins of interest  Depending on various conditions, the gene expression of HEK 293 cells may vary. The following proteins of interest (among many others) are commonly found in untreated HEK 293 cells: * Corticotrophin releasing factor type 1 receptor * Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors EDG1, EDG3 and EDG5 * Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 * Transient receptor potential TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC6  References  External links * HEK 293 Transfection and Selection Data @ Cell-culture Database * A HEK293 Cell Database * 293 Cells (CRL-1573) in the ATCC database * Transcript of FDA meeting, in which, starting page 77, van der Eb describes in detail the origin of HEK 293 cell * 293T in the Culture Collections of Public Health England * Cellosaurus entry for HEK 293 Human cell lines ","title":"HEK 293 cells"},{"id":"1198167","text":"The Halifax Forum is an arena and multi-purpose facility in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its uses include sporting events, bingo, ice skating, concerts and markets. It was built in 1927 on the site of the former Nova Scotia Provincial Exhibition which was badly damaged by the Halifax explosion in 1917. It opened on 26 December 1927 and incorporated the first artificial ice surface east of Montreal. The building was added to the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2003. Sports It is the former home of the Nova Scotia Voyageurs of the American Hockey League. Other former tenants include the Halifax Junior Canadians, Halifax Wolverines (senior team), and the Maritime Major Hockey League's Halifax St. Mary's. The Voyageurs moved to the new Halifax Metro Centre in 1978. The arena now hosts Dalhousie Tigers hockey, Halifax McDonald's of the Nova Scotia Major Midget Hockey League and the QMJHL's Mooseheads preseason games as well as the Halifax Hawks minor hockey team. It is also home to basketball, boxing and curling. The arena's capacity for hockey is 5,600.

History and campus  = Architecture = The school was founded on the third floor of the old Cass Union School in 1907. Its historic landmark building on Second Avenue in downtown Detroit was built in 1917. To the south of it an addition was built in 1985. The new, modern facilities of the school were built in 2004 in an adjacent lot to the north of the original building on Grand River Avenue. In 2007 there was a large fire in the old structure. Complete demolition of the vacant Cass Tech building began in June 2011 and was finished by November. Pictures of the old historic structures, both from the outside and the abandoned inside floors and classes, can be seen here . In addition, a 3D floor-by-floor interactive map of the old building is available here as well. Following the fire in the old structure, it was demolished and removed by Homrich Demolition.Images and information on the demolition of the structure can be found in the Homrich Demolition project file. At time of demolition, the school building was approximately and weighed more than . Over 90% of the material in the building was recycled for other uses or as backfill.

History =Notable events= Centre 200 was conceived as a bicentennial project of the municipality, and was constructed on the former site of the old Sydney Forum in the downtown area. The venue opened in early 1987, and hosted a concert by musician Bryan Adams as its first major event. It was the primary sporting venue for the 1987 Canada Winter Games and hosted the opening ceremonies which were attended by then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. From 1988 to 1996, the arena was home to professional ice hockey, the American Hockey League's Cape Breton Oilers, until the parent Edmonton Oilers elected to relocate the team to Hamilton, Ontario. In 1993, the Oilers won the AHL's Calder Cup championship in front of a sellout crowd at Centre 200. In 1993 and 1994, the arena was home to the Cape Breton Breakers of the National Basketball League (NBL). The NBL folded on July 9, 1994. The arena hosted the MJAHL's Cape Breton Islanders for the 1996‚Äì97 season. Antique & Custom car show at Centre 200. Prior to the 1997‚Äì98 QMJHL season, the Granby Pr√©dateurs, winners of the 1996 Memorial Cup, relocated from Granby, Quebec to Sydney, Nova Scotia and were renamed the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles. The team, which won a division title in 2003‚Äì04, remains Centre 200's primary tenant. Future National Hockey League stars such as Sidney Crosby, Marc-Andr√© Fleury, and Vincent Lecavalier have skated at Centre 200 as QMJHL players. In March 2000, Centre 200 hosted the 2000 Esso Canadian National Championship for women's ice hockey, during which Ontario defeated Quebec to win the gold medal. Centre 200 co-hosted the 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, along with the Halifax Metro Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The arena is very popular for community ice hockey, annually hosting both the Sydney Academy Blue and White Pepsi Challenge Cup and the Royal Canadian Legion Bantam AAA Challenge Cup. The tournaments and games provide hospitality for teams from all over Nova Scotia and generally draw large crowds. Centre 200 hosted the 2008 QMJHL Entry Draft, which was projected to inject over $2 million into the local economy. The arena also hosted game one of the 2008 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge in November 2008. Aside from ice hockey, Centre 200 has also hosted performances by popular acts such as Rush, Metallica, Elton John, The Tragically Hip, Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Nickelback, Rita MacNeil, The Rankin Family, World Wrestling Entertainment events, among many others. In March 2009, it was announced that major renovations would occur to the arena, thanks to financial contributions from the Provincial and federal governments, the municipality and $500,000 from the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles. Renovations include a new video scoreboard, 13 luxury boxes and new club seating. It is anticipated that the renovations will increase the building's capacity to over 5,000. In December 2013‚ÄìJanuary 2014, Centre 200 was one of the host arenas for the 2014 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. Team USA went on to win the tournament 4‚Äì0 against Team Pacific.

Upon graduation Minshall trained as an architect at London University, before embarking on his boat the Hawke (now known as Sperwer and on display in the Netherlands in the indoor museum of the Zuiderzee Museum in Enkhuizen) on his quest to be the first Englishman to sail across Europe to the Black Sea. Minshall traded for the Hawke in Bosham, exchanging for it from Gerald Hulse in 1931 with a sports car. Hulse had only purchased the Hawke the year before from Dr. Marmaduke Fawkes who had owned the boat since 1926 having bought it over from the Netherlands. Minshall was accompanied by his first wife, Elizabeth, but they separated during this trip and were later divorced. The subsequent encounter with the German agent, Lisa Kaltenbrunner came while sailing down the River Danube. She hitched a lift on his yacht ‚Äì but it was no coincidence. She had been sent to discover whether he was charting the river and investigating oil storage depots for British intelligence. Having seduced him, she attempted to poison him, but Minshall survived, and the knowledge he had gained did indeed prove useful to the British in a subsequent operation during the war. Minshall was also well known as an amateur racing driver, who specialised in the kind of road races that are generally illegal today. A two time competitor in the Monte Carlo rally, his greatest trump came in 1937, when he was presented with a trophy by Benito Mussolini for winning the 1937 Italian Foreign Challenge Trophy ‚Äì a three-day, 4,000-mile road race between Rome and Sicily. It involved over 400 cars, and led to the death of four drivers. He also was the first man to drive an air cooled vehicle north to south across the Sahara desert. At the outbreak of World War II, he was recalled to duty as part of the RNVR where he had a varied career, including working for Ian Fleming. Initially he was a watchkeeper in the Admiralty operations room in London. In early 1940 he was a major participant in the failed scheme to block the Danube in Rumania to disrupt German oil imports, working under diplomatic cover as British Vice Consul in Bucharest. Later, in November 1940, leading a joint NID/SOE teamhttps://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3496.html Extract from log of HMS TALISMAN 26th November 1940 Minshall ran Operation Shamrock, where a commandeered fishing smack was used as an observation platform for monitoring German U-boat traffic in the Gironde estuary. Minshall was Mentioned in Dispatches for his part commanding that operation. Subsequently, he ran a section at HMS Flowerdown, using direction finding and transmitter analysis (\\"Z machines\\") to identify the positions of individual ships. As such, during May 1941 he played a part in the hunt for the Bismarck. Posted to Fiji, he managed to get his posting changed to New Zealand, where he worked on various intelligence projects, including establishing a Z machine intercept station at Rapuara near Blenheim. Recalled to the UK, he was landed in occupied Yugoslavia as officer in charge of the Allied Naval Mission to Tito in Yugoslavia. Minshall was married four times, the first to Elizabeth Dorothy Magdalene Loveday, from whom he was divorced in 1935. His second wife was Isolde Llewellyn, his third Janine Paulette Sergent of Lyons and fourth Christina Majorie Zambra, great niece of the Scottish artist Harrington Mann, with whom he had four sons Peter, Matthew, Luke and Timothy.

Some of the most common waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine wave , square wave, triangular wave and sawtooth shapes. These waveforms can be either repetitive or single-shot (which requires an internal or external trigger source).cnx.org - Using a Basic Function Generator, 2005-08-21 Integrated circuits used to generate waveforms may also be described as function generator ICs. In addition to producing sine waves, function generators may typically produce other repetitive waveforms including sawtooth and triangular waveforms, square waves, and pulses. Another feature included on many function generators is the ability to add a DC offset. Although function generators cover both audio and RF frequencies, they are usually not suitable for applications that need low distortion or stable frequency signals. When those traits are required, other signal generators would be more appropriate. Some function generators can be phase-locked to an external signal source (which may be a frequency reference) or another function generator. Function generators are used in the development, test and repair of electronic equipment. For example, they may be used as a signal source to test amplifiers or to introduce an error signal into a control loop. Function generators are primarily used for working with analog circuits, related pulse generators are primarily used for working with digital circuits.  Electronic instruments  = Working = Simple function generators usually generate triangular waveform whose frequency can be controlled smoothly as well as in steps. This triangular wave is used as the basis for all of its other outputs. The triangular wave is generated by repeatedly charging and discharging a capacitor from a constant current source. This produces a linearly ascending and descending voltage ramp. As the output voltage reaches upper or lower limits, the charging or discharging is reversed using a comparator, producing the linear triangle wave. By varying the current and the size of the capacitor, different frequencies may be obtained. Sawtooth waves can be produced by charging the capacitor slowly, using a current, but using a diode over the current source to discharge quickly - the polarity of the diode changes the polarity of the resulting sawtooth, i.e. slow rise and fast fall, or fast rise and slow fall. A 50% duty cycle square wave is easily obtained by noting whether the capacitor is being charged or discharged, which is reflected in the current switching comparator output. Other duty cycles (theoretically from 0% to 100%) can be obtained by using a comparator and the sawtooth or triangle signal. Most function generators also contain a non- linear diode shaping circuit that can convert the triangle wave into a reasonably accurate sine wave by rounding off the corners of the triangle wave in a process similar to clipping in audio systems. A typical function generator can provide frequencies up to 20 MHz. RF generators for higher frequencies are not function generators in the strict sense since they typically produce pure or modulated sine signals only. Function generators, like most signal generators, may also contain an attenuator, various means of modulating the output waveform, and often the ability to automatically and repetitively \\"sweep\\" the frequency of the output waveform (by means of a voltage-controlled oscillator) between two operator-determined limits. This capability makes it very easy to evaluate the frequency response of a given electronic circuit. Some function generators can also generate white or pink noise. More advanced function generators are called arbitrary waveform generators (AWG). They use direct digital synthesis (DDS) techniques to generate any waveform that can be described by a table of amplitudes. = Specifications = Typical specifications for a general-purpose function generator are: * Produces sine, square, triangular, sawtooth (ramp), and pulse output. Arbitrary waveform generators can produce waves of any shape. * It can generate a wide range of frequencies. For example, the Tektronix FG 502 (ca 1974) covers 0.1 Hz to 11 MHz., pp=1-7-1-8 * Frequency stability of 0.1 percent per hour for analog generators or for a digital generator. * Maximum sinewave distortion of about 1% (accuracy of diode shaping network) for analog generators.FG 502 distortion is Arbitrary waveform generators may have distortion less than below and less than above * Some function generators can be phase locked to an external signal source, which may be a frequency reference or another function generator. * Amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) may be supported. * Output amplitude up to peak-to-peak. * Amplitude can be modified, usually by a calibrated attenuator with decade steps and continuous adjustment within each decade. * Some generators provide a DC offset voltage, e.g. adjustable between -5V to +5V. * An output impedance of . = Software = A completely different approach to function generation is to use software instructions to generate a waveform, with provision for output. For example, a general-purpose digital computer can be used to generate the waveform; if frequency range and amplitude are acceptable, the sound card fitted to most computers can be used to output the generated wave.  Circuit elements  =Waveform generator= An electronic circuit element used for generating waveforms within other apparatus that can be used in communications and instrumentation circuits, and also in a function generator instrument. Examples are the Exar XR2206 and , which can generate sine, square, triangle, ramp, and pulse waveforms at a voltage-controllable frequency. =Function generator= An electronic circuit element that provides an output proportional to some mathematical function (such as the square root) of its input; such devices are used in feedback control systems and in analog computers. Examples are the Raytheon QK329 square-law tube and the Intersil ICL8048 Log/Antilog Amplifier.  Mechanical function generators  Mechanical function generators are linkages, cam- follower mechanisms or non-circular gears, designed to reproduce different types of functions, either periodic (like sine or cosine functions), or single-shot (logarithm, parabolic, tangent functions etc.). Measurement instruments like pressure gauges, altimeters and barometers include linkage- type function generators as linearization means. Before the advent of digital computers, mechanical function generators were used in the construction of gun fire control systems, and mechanical calculators.

Three units were planned, each of four cars, and since the trains would have been privately owned by the operator of the entertainment complex, British Rail allocated carriage numbers 99469-99481 (from the private owner carriage series) for the individual vehicles. In the event, the early 1990s recession spelt the end of the Battersea project. The entertainment complex was never built, nor were the trains, and the former power station continued to stand as an empty shell for the next 25 years. The sale and redevelopment of the power station site in the 2010s has led to the alternative of a two stop extension to the Northern line, which removes the need for dedicated services from Victoria.

The arena opened in May 2001, replacing Memorial Stadium. The centre's name comes from it being located at the beginning of the Trans-Canada Highway. At full capacity the arena can seat 7,000 people. The arena is the home of the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada and the Newfoundland Growlers of the ECHL. Naming rights Though the centre's name is often assumed to be a generic name based solely on the building's location, Mile One Centre is in fact among the many North American sports venues that have raised funds by selling their naming rights. In the case of Mile One, brewing company Molson initially acquired the naming rights for 10 years (2001‚Äì2011), as well as other privileges such as being the venue's exclusive beer supplier, for $1.5 million.Revenues From Sports Venues - Naming Rights, retrieved August 9, 2010 Molson then resold the naming rights to Danny Williams, then-owner of Cable Atlantic (and later premier of Newfoundland and Labrador), for $600,000. Before the centre opened, however, Williams sold Cable Atlantic to Rogers Communications in order to pursue politics, but retained the naming rights personally. Ultimately Williams chose to name the centre based on the venue's geography. \\"Mile One\\" is a trademark owned by the Williams family's charitable foundation, not the city, meaning that the centre can only use the \\"Mile One\\" name so long as it has the family's permission to do so. This implies that if and when Williams's rights expire and are not renewed, the centre might be forced to find a new name, regardless of whether or not a new sponsor is found. Hockey Interior of Mile One Centre The building was originally home to the St. John's Maple Leafs of the American Hockey League. The Leafs played out of the centre from 2001‚Äì2005 before relocating to Toronto, Ontario to become the Toronto Marlies. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) stated that the relocation was necessary to better monitor prospects for the co-owned Toronto Maple Leafs. The Dobbin family were granted an expansion Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) franchise in 2004 to be later named the St. John's Fog Devils. The Fog Devils began playing at Mile One Centre in 2005. However, the Fog Devils would relocate to Montreal, Quebec, after three seasons in St. John's to become the Montreal Junior Hockey Club. Many reasons were attributed to the Fog Devils' demise including lack of fan support, a poor lease agreement and high travel costs. The Fog Devils' departure left Mile One Centre without a major tenant for the first time since the building opened. Professional hockey returned to St. John's in 2011 when Winnipeg-based True North Sports and Entertainment announced a lease agreement with former Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams that saw their AHL franchise (formerly known as the Manitoba Moose) relocated to the Mile One Centre. The St. John's IceCaps played their inaugural season in 2011‚Äì12 and as the minor league affiliate of True North's National Hockey League team, the Winnipeg Jets. In honour of this development, the Kraft Hockeyville pre-season game between the Jets and the Ottawa Senators (which was originally to be held in Conception Bay when announced as it was prior to the relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers to become the Jets, causing the Moose to become the IceCaps) was moved to the Mile One Centre. In March 2015, it was announced that the Jets would move their AHL team from St. John's back to Winnipeg as the Moose in 2015‚Äì16. The IceCaps' organization was then able to get the Montreal Canadiens' AHL team, the Hamilton Bulldogs, to relocate to St. John's for the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season, retaining the IceCaps name. However, this was only a temporary move while the Canadiens built a rink for their AHL team in Laval, Quebec. In 2017, the Canadiens-owned franchise left and became the Laval Rocket. In 2018, after a year without a hockey tenant at Mile One, St. John's was granted an ECHL expansion team with the Newfoundland Growlers. Basketball After long negotiations, the arena became the home to the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada beginning with the 2017‚Äì18 season bringing professional basketball to St. John's. Other sporting events The arena hosts the annual Herder Memorial Trophy tournament, the largest hockey tournament in the province. It hosted the 2002 AHL All-Star Game and the 2014 AHL All-Star Game in which the AHL All-Stars faced F√§rjestad BK of the Swedish Hockey League. On September 22, 2014, Mile One Centre held two split squad preseason games for the Ottawa Senators vs. the New York Islanders. New York won both games 3‚Äì2, the latter game on a shootout. The Senators faced the Carolina Hurricanes at Mile One for another preseason game on September 27, 2015. A National Basketball Association exhibition game between the Toronto Raptors and the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003, was cancelled on game night due to an excess of condensation built up on the playing surface due to the inside temperature. LeBron James was on hand as it was a scheduled preseason game of his rookie season. Other hosted sporting events include: * 2004 World U-17 Hockey Challenge * 2005 Skate Canada International * 2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts * 2008 5th World Junior Street & Ball Hockey Championship * During the 2010-2011 hockey season, Hockey Canada used the arena as host venue for the Four Nations Cup and the Telus Cup. The arena hosted the 2017 Tim Hortons Brier, the Canadian men's curling championship. Other events The Juno Awards were presented at Mile One Centre on April 14, 2002. This marked the first time the awards show officially went on the road outside the provinces of Ontario or British Columbia. In January 2009, it was announced that the Junos were returning to Mile One Centre in April 2010. Drake, K'naan, Justin Bieber, Michael Buble, and Metric performed at the 2010 Juno Awards there. This made St. John's the first city to host the awards show for a second time since they started traveling the country in 2002. Mile One Centre was the main venue for the third annual Avalon Expo sci-fi/comics/pop-culture convention on August 25‚Äì27, 2017. The first musical act to play at Mile One Centre was Live in 2001.

The 5-pence value includes emblems of the different nations of the UK. The postage and revenue stamps of the United Kingdom issued in 1887 are known as the \\"Jubilee\\" issue because they were issued during the year of the Golden Jubilee of the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne in 1837. They continued in use throughout the remainder of Victoria's reign, and many of the designs were reused in the stamps of Edward VII. The Jubilee issue includes the first British stamps to be printed in two colours. Origins The variety of colours and designs was partly in response to the much-disliked \\"Lilac and Green\\" issues of 1883-1884. The 1884 Stamp Committee was formed to make decisions about improved replacements. After several meetings, and considering a number of essays by De La Rue (many of which survive in the marketplace), they produced a report recommending the use of surface printing, two colours in fugitive inks, coloured paper, and the dropping of the corner letters that had distinguished stamps on the sheet. Issue The 1887 issue generally followed the Committee's recommendations and the d, d, 2d, d, 3d, 4d, 5d, 6d, 9d and 1s values were put on sale 1 January 1887. A 10d value followed on 24 February 1890 and the d value on 15 September 1892. The stamps continued in use largely unchanged, though specialists identify shade variations, to the end of the century. From 1 January 1900, the halfpenny value was reprinted in blue-green, and the one- shilling value went to a two-colour scheme of carmine rose and green from 11 July 1900.

It is one of the closest known stars to the Sun confirmed to possess a planetary system with more than two planets, after Gliese 1061, YZ Ceti, Tau Ceti, and Luyten's Star; as of 2018, four extrasolar planets have been found to orbit the star. The planetary system is also notable for the orbital properties of its planets. It is the only known system of orbital companions to exhibit a near-triple conjunction in the rare phenomenon of Laplace resonance (a type of resonance first noted in Jupiter's inner three Galilean moons). It is also the first extrasolar system around a normal star with measured coplanarity. While planets b and c are located in the system's habitable zone, they are giant planets believed to be analogous to Jupiter. Distance and visibility Gliese 876 is located fairly close to the Solar System. According to astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite, the star shows a parallax of 213.28 milliarcseconds, which corresponds to a distance of . Despite being located so close to Earth, the star is so faint that it is invisible to the naked eye and can only be seen using a telescope. Stellar characteristics As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is much less massive than the Sun: estimates suggest it has only 32% of the mass of the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths. Estimating the age and metallicity of cool stars is difficult due to the formation of diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is less than 5 billion years old but the long rotational period of the star implies that it is at least older than 100 million years. Like many low-mass stars, Gliese 876 is a variable star. Its variable star designation is IL Aquarii and it is classified as a BY Draconis variable. Its brightness fluctuates by around 0.04 magnitudes. This type of variability is thought to be caused by large starspots moving in and out of view as the star rotates. Gliese 876 emits X-rays. Planetary system =Observation history= The orbits of the planets of Gliese 876. Note that the strong gravitational interactions between the planets causes rapid orbital precession, so this diagram is only valid at the stated epoch. On June 23, 1998, an extrasolar planet was announced in orbit around Gliese 876 by two independent teams led by Geoffrey Marcy and Xavier Delfosse. The planet was designated Gliese 876 b and was detected by Doppler spectroscopy. Based on luminosity measurement, the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) is believed to be located between 0.116 and 0.227 AU. On January 9, 2001, a second planet designated Gliese 876 c was detected, inside the orbit of the previously-discovered planet. The relationship between the orbital periods initially disguised the planet's radial velocity signature as an increased orbital eccentricity of the outer planet. Eugenio Rivera and Jack Lissauer found that the two planets undergo strong gravitational interactions as they orbit the star, causing the orbital elements to change rapidly. On June 13, 2005, further observations by a team led by Rivera revealed a third planet, designated Gliese 876 d inside the orbits of the two Jupiter-size planets. In January 2009, the mutual inclination between planets b and c was determined using a combination of radial velocity and astrometric measurements. The planets were found to be almost coplanar, with an angle of only 5.0¬∞ between their orbital planes. On June 23, 2010, astronomers announced a fourth planet, designated Gliese 876 e. This discovery better constrained the mass and orbital properties of the other three planets, including the high eccentricity of the innermost planet. This also filled out the system inside e's orbit; additional planets there would be unstable at this system's age. In 2014, reanalysis of the existing radial velocities showed the possible presence of two additional planets. These planets would have almost the same mass as Gliese 876d. In 2018 a study using hundreds of new radial velocity measurements found no evidence for these planets. If this system has a comet disc, it is undetectable \\"brighter than the fractional dust luminosity 10‚àí5\\" of a recent Herschel study.B. C. Matthews; forthcoming study promised in None of these planets transit the star from the perspective of Earth, making it difficult to study their properties.As of 2006: . No transit has been found as of 2012, either; so they are unlikely. GJ 876 is a candidate parent system for the  ªOumuamua object. The trajectory of this interstellar object took it near the star about 820,000 years ago with a velocity of 5 km/s, after which it has been perturbed by six other stars. =Orbital arrangement= Gliese 876 has a notable orbital arrangement. It is the first planetary system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced the value of the mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions. The system has the second known example of a Laplace resonance with a 1:2:4 resonance of its planets. The first known example was Jupiter's closest Galilean moons - Ganymede, Europa and Io. Numerical integration indicates that the coplanar, four-planet system is stable for at least another billion years. This planetary system comes close to a triple conjunction between the three outer planets once per orbit of the outermost planet. =Planets= The outermost three of the known planets likely formed further away from the star, and migrated inward. ; Gliese 876 d Gliese 876d, discovered in 2005, is the innermost known planet. With an estimated minimum mass only 5.88 times that of the Earth, it is possible that it is a dense terrestrial planet. ; Gliese 876 c Gliese 876 c, discovered in 2001, is a giant planet at 0.62 Jupiter-mass planet. It is in a 1:2 orbital resonance with the outermost known planet, taking 30.340 days to orbit the star. The planet orbits within the habitable zone. Its temperature makes it more likely to be a Class III planet in the Sudarsky extrasolar planet classification. The presence of surface liquid water is possible on sufficiently massive satellites should they exist. ; Gliese 876 b Gliese 876 b, discovered in 1998 is around twice the mass of Jupiter and revolves around its star in an orbit taking approximately 61 days to complete, at a distance of only 0.208 AU, less than the distance from the Sun to Mercury. Its temperature makes it more likely to be a Class II or Class III planet in the Sudarsky model. The presence of surface liquid water is possible on sufficiently massive satellites should they exist. ; Gliese 876 e Gliese 876 e, discovered in 2010, has a mass similar to that of the planet Uranus and its orbit takes 124 days to complete.

The name of the entire inlet in the Nisga'a language is ', with meaning \\"at the back of (someplace)\\". The upper end of the inlet was home to the Tsetsaut ( in Nisga ºa), who after being decimated by war and disease were taken under the protection of the Laxsgiik (Eagle) chief of the Nisga'a, who holds the inlet's title in native law. Despite its naming as a canal, the inlet is a fjord, a completely natural and not man-made geographic feature, and extends northward from the Portland Inlet at Pearse Island, British Columbia, to Stewart, British Columbia and Hyder, Alaska. Observatory Inlet joins the Portland Canal at Ramsden Point, where both merge with Portland Inlet. Pearse Canal joins Portland Canal at the north end of Pearse Island. Portland Canal was given its name by George Vancouver in 1793, in honour of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. The use of the word canal to name inlets on the British Columbia Coast and the Alaska Panhandle is a legacy of the Spanish exploration of the area in the 18th century.

George Vancouver used both terms in his naming of inlets, Hood Canal for example. The placement of the international boundary in the Portland Canal was a major issue during the negotiations over the Alaska boundary dispute, which heated up as a result of the Klondike Gold Rush and ended by arbitration in 1903. Together with Pearse Canal and Tongass Passage, the Portland Canal is defined by the Alaska Boundary Settlement (the Hay-Herbert Treaty) as part of Portland Channel (Canal), a term used as forming the marine boundary in the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1825 but which was undefined at the time.

It flows from the Coast Mountains southwest to Nass Bay, a sidewater of Portland Inlet, which connects to the North Pacific Ocean via the Dixon Entrance. Nass Bay joins Portland Inlet just south of Observatory Inlet. The English name \\"Nass\\" is derived from the Tlingit name Naas which means \\"intestines\\" or \\"guts\\" in reference to the river's large food capacity in its fish (Naish & Story 1963; Leer, Hitch, & Ritter 2001). Can also be a Tlingit word for \\"food depot\\". Former spellings are Naas and Nasse. The Nisga'a name for the river is K'alii Aksim Lisims \\"Lisims (river name) Valley\\". The Gitxsan name is Git-Txaemsim meaning People of Txeemsim (Raven or Trickster); Xsitxemsem in the dialect of the Gitanyow). Lisims means \\"murky\\" in Nisga'a, referring to the river's silt- laden flow. The last of the river are navigable. The river is a commercially valuable salmon fishery. The basin of the Nass is the location of the first modern-day treaty settlement in British Columbia, between the government of that province and the Nisga'a Nation. The name Nisga'a is a reduced form of , which is a loan from Tongass Tlingit, where it means \\"people of the Nass River\\".Rigsby, Bruce \\"Nisga'a Etymology\\", ms. University of Queensland. History Highway 37 over the river About 220 years ago, as recorded by the oral history of the Nisga'a people, the Nass River was dammed by a long lava flow which came from the Tseax Cone and destroyed the Nisga'a villages and caused the death of at least 2000 Nisga'a people by volcanic gas and poisonous smoke. The volcano has been active on at least two occasions (220 and 650 years ago) in the last millennium. Because of our knowledge of this previous disaster, modern monitoring techniques should include studies of the gases emitted by the volcanoes and the institution of a warning system to alert people living down slope from the volcanoes. Hazards If the Tseax Cone were to erupt again, there could be a repeat of the poisonous gas disaster that happened to the Nisga'a people 220 years ago. The eruption could also cause forest fires and could potentially dam local rivers such as the Nass River and the Tseax if the volume of the lava flows are large enough. If the lava flows were to again reach the Nass River, it could have disastrous short-term consequences for the important salmon fisheries on the Nass River system.

Unlike the Beaches International Jazz Festival, most of the events are indoors and located throughout the downtown core. The hub of the festival is Nathan Phillips Square, with more than 40 other locations spread out all across the city. It attracts over 500,000 people and is the city's third largest annual music festival next to NXNE and The Beaches International Jazz Festival. Incorporating a blend of jazz styles - from straight-ahead to bop to fusion to avant-garde- with tastes of other genres (for example, blues, funk, R&B;, hip-hop, Latin, etc...) the festival has something for everyone. It was formerly known as the DuMaurier Jazz Festival, until the ban on tobacco advertising by the federal government forced the need for a new sponsor. Today, the festival is sponsored by TD Bank and has since dropped the word \\"Downtown\\" from its title. Originally started in 1987, the Festival was co-founded by Executive Producer Patrick Taylor and Former Artistic Director Jim Galloway; currently, the Artistic Director is Josh Grossman. Roy Thomson Hall, the CN Tower and Metro Convention Centre were the three venues for that inaugural season. Miles Davis, Roberta Flack and Tony Bennett were the headliners that year.

Let G be a finitely generated group. Then, for each integer n define a_n(G) to be the number of subgroups H of index n in G. Similarly, if G is a topological group, s_n(G) denotes the number of open subgroups U of index n in G. One similarly defines m_n(G) and s_n^triangleleft(G) to denote the number of maximal and normal subgroups of index n, respectively. Subgroup growth studies these functions, their interplay, and the characterization of group theoretical properties in terms of these functions. The theory was motivated by the desire to enumerate finite groups of given order, and the analogy with Mikhail Gromov's notion of word growth. Nilpotent groups Let G be a finitely generated torsionfree nilpotent group. Then there exists a composition series with infinite cyclic factors, which induces a bijection (not though necessarily a homomorphism). :mathbb{Z}^n longrightarrow G such that group multiplication can be expressed by polynomial functions in these coordinates; in particular, the multiplication is definable. Using methods from the model theory of p-adic integers, F. Grunewald, D. Segal and G. Smith showed that the local zeta function : zeta_{G, p}(s) = sum_{ u=0}^infty s_{p^n}(G) p^{-ns} is a rational function in p^{-s} . As an example, let G be the discrete Heisenberg group. This group has a \\"presentation\\" with generators x, , y, , z and relations : [x, y] = z, [x, z] = [y, z] = 1. Hence, elements of G can be represented as triples (a,, b, , c) of integers with group operation given by : (a, b, c)circ(a', b', c') = (a+a', b+b', c+c'+ab'). To each finite index subgroup U of G , associate the set of all \\"good bases\\" of U as follows. Note that G has a normal series : G=langle x, y, zrangletrianglerightlangle y, zrangletrianglerightlangle zrangletriangleright 1 with infinite cyclic factors. A triple (g_1, g_2, g_3) in G is called a good basis of U , if g_1, g_2, g_3 generate U , and g_2inlangle y, zrangle, g_3inlangle zrangle. In general, it is quite complicated to determine the set of good bases for a fixed subgroup U . To overcome this difficulty, one determines the set of all good bases of all finite index subgroups, and determines how many of these belong to one given subgroup. To make this precise, one has to embed the Heisenberg group over the integers into the group over p-adic numbers. After some computations, one arrives at the formula : zeta_{G, p}(s) = frac{1}{(1-p^{-1})^3}int_mathcal{M} a_{11}_p^{s-1} a_{22}_p^{s-2} a_{33}_p^{s-3};dmu, where mu is the Haar measure on mathbb{Z}_p , cdot_p denotes the p-adic absolute value and mathcal{M} is the set of tuples of p -adic integers : {a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{33}} such that : {x^{a_{11}}y^{a_{12}}z^{a_{13}}, y^{a_{22}}z^{a_{23}}, z^{a_{33}}} is a good basis of some finite-index subgroup. The latter condition can be translated into :a_{33}a_{11}cdot a_{22}. Now, the integral can be transformed into an iterated sum to yield : zeta_{G, p}(s) = sum_{ageq 0}sum_{bgeq 0}sum_{c=0}^{a+b} p^{-as-b(s-1)-c(s-2)} = frac{1-p^{3-3s}}{(1-p^{-s})(1-p^{1-s})(1-p^{2-2s})(1-p^{2-3s})} where the final evaluation consists of repeated application of the formula for the value of the geometric series. From this we deduce that zeta_G (s) can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as : zeta_G(s) = frac{zeta(s)zeta(s-1)zeta(2s-2)zeta(2s-3)}{zeta(3s-3)}. For more complicated examples, the computations become difficult, and in general one cannot expect a closed expression for zeta_G(s). The local factor :zeta_{G, p}(s) can always be expressed as a definable p -adic integral. Applying a result of MacIntyre on the model theory of p-adic integers, one deduces again that zeta_G(s) is a rational function in p^{-s} . Moreover, M. du Sautoy and F. Grunewald showed that the integral can be approximated by Artin L-functions. Using the fact that Artin L-functions are holomorphic in a neighbourhood of the line Re (s)=1, they showed that for any torsionfree nilpotent group, the function zeta_G(s) is meromorphic in the domain :Re(s)>alpha-delta where alpha is the abscissa of convergence of zeta_G(s) , and delta is some positive number, and holomorphic in some neighbourhood of Re (s)=alpha. Using a Tauberian theorem this implies : sum_{nleq x} s_n(G) sim x^alphalog^k x for some real number alpha and a non-negative integer k . Congruence subgroups Subgroup growth and coset representations Let G be a group, U a subgroup of index n. Then G acts on the set of left cosets of U in G by left shift: :g(hU)=(gh)U. In this way, U induces a homomorphism of G into the symmetric group on G/U. G acts transitively on G/U, and vice versa, given a transitive action of G on :{1, ldots, n}, the stabilizer of the point 1 is a subgroup of index n in G . Since the set :{2, ldots, n} can be permuted in :(n-1)! ways, we find that s_n(G) is equal to the number of transitive G-actions divided by (n-1)!. Among all G -actions, we can distinguish transitive actions by a sifting argument, to arrive at the following formula : s_n(G) = frac{h_n(G)}{(n-1)!} - sum_{ u=1}^{n-1} frac{h_{n- u}(G)s_ u(G)}{(n- u)!}, where h_n(G) denotes the number of homomorphisms :varphi:Grightarrow S_n. In several instances the function h_n(G) is easier to be approached then s_n(G), and, if h_n(G) grows sufficiently large, the sum is of negligible order of magnitude, hence, one obtains an asymptotic formula for s_n(G). As an example, let F_2 be the free group on two generators. Then every map of the generators of F_2 extends to a homomorphism :F_2rightarrow S_n, that is :h_n(F_2)=(n!)^2. From this we deduce :s_n(F_2)sim ncdot n!. For more complicated examples, the estimation of h_n(G) involves the representation theory and statistical properties of symmetric groups.

History =New Wave= Haines formed numerous bands when he was at school. At college he joined The Servants who recorded two commercially unsuccessful albums. It was only when Haines formed The Auteurs with his girlfriend Alice Readman (who had also been drafted into The Servants from time to time) and Glenn Collins in 1991 that he began to achieve some success. Regular gigging in the London area and an NME-sponsored gig brought them to the attention of Hut Records. They released their first single, \\"Showgirl\\" in 1993, and their debut album New Wave a month later. Haines was later to claim that this was the album that started Britpop, though he later showed disdain towards the movement, stating in a 2003 interview that Britpop consisted of \\"a bunch of bands who weren't good enough to exist in their own right, like music's equivalent of the Bloomsbury Group.\\" Certainly it was ahead of its time in turning back from the acid house then popular to more traditional songwriting in the vein of The Kinks or The Small Faces. It is arguable that more commercially successful bands (such as Suede) owed much to Haines' vision. In any case, the album sold only 12,000 copies but was nominated for a Mercury Prize although the eventual winners were Suede =A brush with fame= Their second album, Now I'm a Cowboy, (1994) featured \\"Lenny Valentino\\", one of their most famous songs. By now the band were touring Europe and the States regularly, and were gaining a reputation as one of the best new British bands. However, just as the band looked like achieved mainstream success (as other British bands, such as Oasis and Blur were then doing), Haines broke both of his ankles, resulting in the cancellation of much of their 1994 European tour. At the time he claimed \\"I jumped off a fifteen-foot wall (while) touring, ... to finish the tour and get the insurance\\" but later, in the sleeve notes to Das Capital, he denied that it was deliberate, writing \\"I merely drank too much wine and fell over. It happens.\\" Having to use a wheelchair for most of 1995, Haines wrote the very different songs that would end up becoming the Auteurs' third album, After Murder Park. Even bleaker and more introspective than previous Auteurs albums, this was just as English as his previous work but now showed very different influences: the downbeat folk of Richard Thompson, the aggression of My Bloody Valentine, the pared down experimentalism of Wire, and the caustic lyrics of The Fall. It was produced by Steve Albini and recorded at Abbey Road studios in North London. =After After Murder Park= The Auteurs recorded a session for John Peel on 20 February 1996. At this point, Haines created a solo side project called Baader-Meinhof. Haines released one eponymous album under this moniker in 1996, which is named after the Baader Meinhof terrorist group. The sound was similar to that of The Auteurs, but more sparsely produced and with elements of funk and electronica, with lyrics, typically for the ever-contrary Haines, about terrorism. After this, Haines disbanded the Auteurs, only to bring them back together again for their fourth album How I Learned to Love the Bootboys. This sounds like an amalgamation of Haines' previous styles: it is electronic, but has the same concern for pop hooks as his first two albums: on the other hand, the lyrics are brooding and obsessive, in a similar way to those on After Murder Park. From this point on, The Auteurs became merely a name for whatever musicians Haines chose to bring together for specific projects. =Black Box Recorder= After this album Haines created another side project with John Moore (formerly of The Jesus and Mary Chain) and Sarah Nixey: Black Box Recorder. The band produced three commercially successful albums, England Made Me, The Facts of Life, and Passionoia. There is also a B-sides collection, The Worst of Black Box Recorder. The Facts of Life produced the eponymous single, which has been the biggest hit of Haines' career so far. Although no official split announcement was made, the band was on hiatus during the mid-2000s. =Going solo= Haines has branched into film music, writing the music for Christie Malry's Own Double Entry, a British film based on the novel by B. S. Johnson. Director Paul Tickell had originally expressed a wish to license How I Learned to Love the Bootboys as the Soundtrack for the film but couldnt afford the sync rights from Virgin Records which allowed Luke to write a soundtrack more tailored for the film. Unfortunately reception for the film was lacklustre as a result of the film being released post-Twin Towers attack in America, as Luke put it \\"Back in 2000, this celluloidal genocide just seemed like logical fictitious denouement to a film about a deranged, avenging angel, but in the heightened state of paranoia of the post Twin Towers world, it seems less far-fetched. The upshot of all this is that no distributors will go anywhere [the film]\\". He has also produced a solo album under his own name, The Oliver Twist Manifesto. After the purchase of Virgin Records by French company Fnac, Hut Records' (The Auteur's erstwhile label) boss David Boyd decided before the dissolution of the company he built that Luke should do The Auteurs 'Best of' album ' but gave him a budget to re-record the songs as he saw fit. Luke speculated in his book Post Everything that this was partly as a thanks to Luke but primarily a parting shot at Fnac for dissolving the company he'd built up for over ten years. Das Capital: The Song Writing Genius of Luke Haines consisted mostly of Auteurs songs rerecorded by Luke most notably with the inclusion of a string quartet and a couple of new original songs thrown in. In 2001 Haines called for a \\"National Pop Strike\\". A box set covering his career to date, Luke Haines is Dead, was issued in 2005, and two new albums were expected in 2006: 'Off My Rocker at the Art School Bop', and the soundtrack to the abandoned musical 'Property', which like his Black Box Recorder work, also features Sarah Nixey. Cherry Red Records released a \\"Best of The Servants\\" compilation, with sleeve notes by Haines, early in 2006. New album Off My Rocker at the Art School Bop was released in October 2006. Haines worked with maverick pop producer Richard X (Sugababes, Liberty X, Rachel Stevens) on some tracks. The album was preceded by a double A-sided single 'Off My Rocker at the Art School Bop (Richard X version) b/w I Am The Best Artist/Skinny White Girls.' There is currently no news on a release date for the 'Property' soundtrack. Haines toured the UK and Ireland during November 2006. John Moore guested on bowed saw and backing vocals at some gigs. On 16 November 2006, Haines played a live session for BBC Radio 6 Music's Gideon Coe show. On 13 December 2006, Haines played a live session (three songs) for BBC Radio 2's Janice Long show. During an interview on the same show Haines said that he may play some gigs in early 2007 in support of a E.P. release of Leeds United. Haines has played at book signings for David Peace who was promoting The Damned United, a book on Brian Clough's brief tenure at Leeds United in the 1970s. Leeds United relates to this, and with the reference to the Yorkshire Ripper, to Peace's earlier Yorkshire/Red Riding Quartet. The refrain \\"The North! The North!\\" advances on the earlier Auteurs track The South Will Rise Again, itself a response to The N.W.R.A. by The Fall. The phrase \\"The North! The North! Where we do what we want! The North! The North! Where we do what we like\\" is also a quote from a character in the Red Riding Quartet. Haines and Peter Buck (formerly of R.E.M.) collaborated on an album, Beat Poetry for Survivalists, which was released in 2020. In issue four of the comic book Phonogram, Haines appears as a spirit guide leading the main character through a metaphorical land representing Britpop. =Black Box Recorder reformation= In December 2007, Black Box Recorder teamed up with Art Brut to create the single Christmas Number One under the collaborative title of The Black Arts. In October 2008 Black Box Recorder appeared at the Nick Sanderson (Earl Brutus) tribute concert. It was subsequently announced on Luke Haines' web site that the band would play their first headlining gig for five years at The Luminaire, Kilburn, London in February 2009. =Author= Haines' memoir Bad Vibes: Britpop and My Part in Its Downfall was published on 1 January 2009 by William Heinemann Ltd. The book covers Haines' experiences during the Britpop era 1991 to 1997. In May 2009 a novel about Haines by author Tim Mitchell Truth and Lies in Murder Park: a book about Mr Luke Haines was published by benben press. The book includes material based on interviews with Luke, and explores the themes of his music. Post Everything: Outsider Rock and Roll, Haines' second book of memoirs, was published in July 2011 by William Heinemann Ltd. Haines' first cookbook Outsider Food and Righteous Rock 'N' Roll was published in 2015 =Documentary= A documentary on Luke Haines by Irish director Niall McCann, called Art Will Save the World, premiered at the East End film festival in Dalston on 6 July 2012. It was also shown at the Barcelona, Copenhagen and Cork film festivals. It featured interviews with Jarvis Cocker, John Niven, David Peace and Stewart Home along with extensive interviews with Haines.

It runs from the end of Interstate 180 in Hennepin to U.S. Route 34 in Oswego. This is a distance of .  Route description  Outside of Hennepin, the road stretches east to an intersection with Interstate 39 near Oglesby, paralleling I-39 to the north for several miles on a concurrency with Illinois Route 351 before turning eastward again near LaSalle-Peru. Between LaSalle-Peru and Ottawa, Route 71 parallels the south bank of the Illinois River and passes Starved Rock State Park. It then crosses the Illinois River on a simple four-lane girder bridge. It overlaps Illinois Route 23 through downtown Ottawa and U.S. Route 6 east from Route 23 before intersecting with Interstate 80. From here it continues to the northeast, passing through Norway, Newark, and Yorkville. Its eastern terminus is near downtown Oswego at an intersection with U.S. Highway 34 and Wolfs Crossing Road. The now-defunct Prairie Parkway project, a limited-access highway, would have had an interchange with Route 71 southwest of High Point Road near Yorkville. The stretch between US 34 and Orchard Road in Oswego was widened to two lanes each direction, with the addition of center turn lane, in which the project was completed in the Fall of 2015. There are also current plans to build a silica sand mine off of IL 71 near Starved Rock State Park, pending final approval by the City of Ottawa. The plan is currently opposed by environmental groups due to the intended use of the sand in fracking practices and the potential damage caused by airborne dust and blasting operations.  History  Before 1938, Illinois Route 71 originally connected from US 51 (now IL 251) at Twelvemile Corner to US 30 at Aurora. In 1938, IL 71 moved onto a new route as US 30 was rerouted through Twelvemile Corner. It traveled from IL 29 near Bureau Junction to IL 23 at Ottawa. Before that, it was part of Illinois Route 89 as well as Illinois Route 7A, and Illinois Route 89A. In 1939, a ferry that crossed the Illinois River was replaced by a truss bridge. In 1942, IL 71 was extended towards US 34 in Oswego. In 1947, the road between Norway and Yorkville was finished and then opened to traffic. In 1969, IL 71 was truncated from Bureau Junction to Hennepin after IL 26 was extended to Peoria.

Al-Fadl was recruited for the Afghan war through the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn. In 1988, he joined Al-Qaeda and took an oath of fealty to Bin Laden. After a dispute with Bin Laden, al-Fadl defected and became an informant to the United States government on al Qaeda activities. Al-Qaeda Al-Fadl was recruited to the Afghan mujahideen \\"through the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn\\" (presumably when he was in the U.S. in the mid 1980s), and he became a \\"senior employee\\" of al-Qaeda. He attended meetings on August 11 and 20, 1988, with Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mohammed Atef, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, Wael Hamza Julaidan, and Mohammed Loay Bayazid and eight others to discuss the founding of \\"al-Qaeda\\".Wright, Lawrence. \\"The Looming Tower\\", 2006. p. 131-134Indictment of Enaam Arnaout in 2002, archived at the United States Department of Justice In Khartoum, he traveled to Hilat Koko with Mamdouh Mahmud Salim in late 1993 or early 1994, and met with Amin Abdel Marouf to discuss chemical weapons.Benjamin, Daniel & Steven Simon. \\"The Age of Sacred Terror\\", 2002 Al-Fadl became a business agent for al-Qaeda but resented receiving a salary of only $500 a month while some of the Egyptians in al-Qaeda were given $1,200 a month. When Osama bin Laden discovered that al-Fadl had skimmed about $110,000 and asked for restitution, the latter defected and became an informant for the United States. Defection After embezzling $110,000 from the organization, al-Fadl \\"defected\\". He contacted the CIA via the United States's Eritrean embassy and, receiving encouragement from FBI special agents Jack Cloonan and Dan Coleman (who were \\"seconded\\" to the CIA's Bin Laden unit), he returned (after staying in Germany for a while) to the United States, in spring 1996. While in protective custody, al-Fadl won a modest sum in scratch tickets in the New Jersey lottery, which was taken away by his guards.Junior: The clandestine life of America‚Äôs top Al Qaeda source For the next three years Cloonan and his colleagues oversaw al-Fadl in a safehouse.

In January 2001, the trial began in New York City of four men accused of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in east Africa. The U.S also wanted to prosecute Osama bin Laden in his absence under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). To be able to do so under American law, the prosecutors needed evidence of a criminal organization, which would then allow them to prosecute the leader, even if he could not be linked directly to the crime. Al-Fadl was taken on as a key prosecution witness, who, along with a number of other sources, claimed that Osama bin Laden was the leader of a large international terrorist organization which was called al-Qaeda. =Fatwa= In giving testimony, Jamal al-Fadl described a 1992 fatwa issued by \\"Abu Hajer al Iraqi\\" (Mamdouh Mahmud Salim) at the request of Al Qaeda leadership, that was putatively based on an earlier fatwa by the influential 14th-century Salafi scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (\\"Ibn al Tamiyeh\\") permitting the killing of Muslim supporters of the \\"Tartars\\" (Mongols) who threatened to invade the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. The fatwa has been described as a pivotal development in that it provided al-Qaeda with justification for the killing of Muslim civilians and bystanders. > Q. Can you tell us now what Abu Hajer al Iraqi said about Ibn al Tamiyeh? > A. He said that our time now is similar like in that time, and he say Ibn > al Tamiyeh, when a tartar come to Arabic war, Arabic countries that time, he > say some Muslims, they help them. And he says Ibn al Tamiyeh, he make a > fatwah. He said anybody around the tartar, he buy something from them and he > sell them something, you should kill him. And also, if when you attack the > tartar, if anybody around them, anything, or he's not military or that -- if > you kill him, you don't have to worry about that. If he's a good person, he > go to paradise and if he's a bad person, he go to hell. =Al-Fadl's debriefing= Patrick J. Fitzgerald, who would later become well known for serving as the Special Prosecutor who investigated the Bush Presidency's leak of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame, played a lead role in debriefing al-Fadl. The transcripts from his debriefing ran to 900 pages. According to the New York Times: The New York Times profiled al-Fadl on December 9, 2007. Their review of the transcripts described his anxieties over testifying, the emotional difficulties enforced idleness caused, and the emotional difficulties his entire family faced due to isolation and culture shock. The article describes his wife, who didn't speak English, demanding he refuse to testify, and demanding to leave him and return to Sudan.

Contents of the treaty  Under the terms of the treaty, Maria Theresa agreed to transfer to the King of Sardinia the city and part of the duchy of Piacenza, the Vigevanesco, part of the duchy of Pavia, part of the county of Anghiera which lay to the west of Lake Maggiore, and claims to the marquisate of Finale. She also engaged to maintain 30,000 men in Italy, to be commanded by Savoy-Sardinia. Great Britain agreed to pay the sum of ¬£300,000 for the ceding of Finale, and to furnish an annual subsidy of ¬£200,000, on the condition that Savoy-Sardinia should employ 45,000 men. In addition to this fiscal arrangement, Britain agreed to send a fleet into the Mediterranean.

In 2011, its population was about 494. Salmon Glacier in British Columbia, a popular tourist destination. History The Nisga'a, who lived around the Nass River, called the head of Portland Canal Skam-A-Kounst, meaning \\"safe house\\" or \\"strong house\\", probably because it served them as a retreat from the harassment of the Haida and Tlingit from the outer coast. They travelled in the area seasonally to pick berries and hunt birds. It and the rest of the Portland Canal had been the domain of the Tsetsaut people, also called the Skam-a-Kounst Indians, or Jits'aawit in Nisga'a, an Athapaskan people who became decimated by war and disease and were driven out of the Stewart area by either Haida or Nisga'a in 1856‚Äì57. The Portland Canal was first explored and named in July 1793 by Captain George Vancouver in honour of William Henry Cavendish Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (1738‚Äì1808), Home Secretary from 1794 to 1801. Vancouver met two friendly native people at the current site of Stewart, BC. The area around the Portland Canal was again explored in 1896 by Captain D.D. Gaillard of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (after whom the Gaillard Cut in the Panama Canal was later named). Two years after Gaillard's visit, the first prospectors and settlers arrived. Among them was D. J. Raine, for whom a creek and a mountain in the area are named. The Stewart brothers arrived in 1902. In 1905, Robert M. Stewart, the first postmaster, named the town Stewart. Gold and silver mining dominated the early economy. Nearby Hyder, Alaska, boomed with the discovery of rich silver veins in the upper Salmon River basin in 1917 and 1918. Hyder became an access and supply point for the mines, while Stewart served as the port for Canadian mining activity, which was centred on the town of Premier, which was accessed by a road from Hyder. Other mines in the area were the Jumbo, BC Silver, Red Cliff, and Porter-Idaho. More large camps were south of Stewart at Anyox and Maple Bay. Stewart had a population of about 10,000 prior to World War I, which then declined to about 700 in 2000. As of 2005, its population had reduced to less than 500. Disney's Eight Below, starring Paul Walker and Jason Biggs, was partially filmed here. The exterior shots from John Carpenter's science fiction classic The Thing were filmed within Salmon Glacier. Fire hall in Stewart Transportation Stewart is accessible by highway from the British Columbia highway system, via Highway 37A, by boat through the Portland Canal, or by air through Stewart Airport. Location West of Stewart is Hyder, Alaska, which is only from the town. Northwest of Stewart, and accessible only by way of Hyder, is Premier, British Columbia, notable for being in Canada, but only accessible through a portion of the United States that is only accessible from Canada. East of the town is Meziadin Junction, which is from the town. Also east is Kitwanga, British Columbia, which is located from the town, and Dease Lake, British Columbia, which is located north of Stewart. It is the northernmost point on Canada's Pacific coast.

It was established in 1946 as a joint venture between AEC and Leyland. History Historical BUT trolleybus #101 in Arnhem British United Traction was established in 1946 when AEC and Leyland amalgamated their trolleybus interests. Neither had produced trolleybuses since early years of World War II. With both forecasting that demand would return to pre-war levels as networks began to close, a joint venture was formed. The new company was organised so that AEC would design and produce vehicles for the UK market while Leyland looked after export markets, although there were some exceptions to this. The only noticeable difference between the manufacturers output was the wheels. Initially vehicles were produced at Leyland's Ham, London factory, with the first vehicles completed in 1947 for Johannesburg. After the factory closed 1948, production moved to AEC's Southall and Leyland's Leyland, Lancashire factories. Following AEC's acquisition of Crossley Motors, AEC transferred its production to the latter's Stockport factory. Trolleybus production wound down in the late 1950s, however a final batch for Wellington was built at Scammell's, Watford factory in 1964.

As regulation focusing on key factors in the financial markets, it forms one of the three components of financial law, the other two being case law and self-regulating market practices.Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), 7 Given the interconnectedness of the banking industry and the reliance that the national (and global) economy hold on banks, it is important for regulatory agencies to maintain control over the standardized practices of these institutions. Another relevant example for the interconnectedness is that the law of financial industries or financial law focuses on the financial (banking), capital, and insurance markets. Supporters of such regulation often base their arguments on the \\"too big to fail\\" notion. This holds that many financial institutions (particularly investment banks with a commercial arm) hold too much control over the economy to fail without enormous consequences. This is the premise for government bailouts, in which government financial assistance is provided to banks or other financial institutions who appear to be on the brink of collapse. The belief is that without this aid, the crippled banks would not only become bankrupt, but would create rippling effects throughout the economy leading to systemic failure. Compliance with bank regulations is verified by personnel known as bank examiners. Objectives The objectives of bank regulation, and the emphasis, vary between jurisdictions. The most common objectives are: * prudential‚Äîto reduce the level of risk to which bank creditors are exposed (i.e. to protect depositors) * systemic risk reduction‚Äîto reduce the risk of disruption resulting from adverse trading conditions for banks causing multiple or major bank failures * to avoid misuse of banks‚Äîto reduce the risk of banks being used for criminal purposes, e.g. laundering the proceeds of crime * to protect banking confidentiality * credit allocation‚Äîto direct credit to favored sectors * it may also include rules about treating customers fairly and having corporate social responsibility. General principles Banking regulations vary widely between jurisdictions. =Licensing and supervision= Bank regulation is a complex process and generally consists of two components:Richard Apostolik, Christopher Donohue, and Peter Went (2009), Foundations of Banking Risk. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, p. 62. * licensing, and * supervision. The first component, licensing, sets certain requirements for starting a new bank. Licensing provides the licence holders the right to own and to operate a bank. The licensing process is specific to the regulatory environment of the country and/or the state where the bank is located. Licensing involves an evaluation of the entity's intent and the ability to meet the regulatory guidelines governing the bank's operations, financial soundness, and managerial actions.Richard Apostolik, Christopher Donohue, and Peter Went (2009), Foundations of Banking Risk. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, p. 63. The regulator supervises licensed banks for compliance with the requirements and responds to breaches of the requirements by obtaining undertakings, giving directions, imposing penalties or (ultimately) revoking the bank's license. The second component, supervision, is an extension of the licence-granting process and consists of supervision of the bank's activities by a government regulatory body (usually the central bank or another independent governmental agency). Supervision ensures that the functioning of the bank complies with the regulatory guidelines and monitors for possible deviations from regulatory standards. Supervisory activities involve on-site inspection of the bank's records, operations and processes or evaluation of the reports submitted by the bank. Examples of bank supervisory bodies include the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States, the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, the Federal Financial Markets Service in the Russian Federation, the Bundesanstalt f√ºr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) in Germany.Richard Apostolik, Christopher Donohue, and Peter Went (2009), Foundations of Banking Risk. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, p. 63. =Minimum requirements= A national bank regulator imposes requirements on banks in order to promote the objectives of the regulator. Often, these requirements are closely tied to the level of risk exposure for a certain sector of the bank. The most important minimum requirement in banking regulation is maintaining minimum capital ratios.Investopedia:Capital Requirement To some extent, U.S. banks have some leeway in determining who will supervise and regulate them.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, The Relationship Between Regulators and the Regulated in Banking, June 2001 =Market discipline= The regulator requires banks to publicly disclose financial and other information and depositors and other creditors are able to use this information to assess the level of risk and to make investment decisions. As a result of this, the bank is subject to market discipline and the regulator can also use market pricing information as an indicator of the bank's financial health. Instruments and requirements =Capital requirement= The capital requirement sets a framework on how banks must handle their capital in relation to their assets. Internationally, the Bank for International Settlements' Basel Committee on Banking Supervision influences each country's capital requirements. In 1988, the Committee decided to introduce a capital measurement system commonly referred to as the Basel Capital Accords. The latest capital adequacy framework is commonly known as Basel III. This updated framework is intended to be more risk sensitive than the original one, but is also a lot more complex. =Reserve requirement= The reserve requirement sets the minimum reserves each bank must hold to demand deposits and banknotes. This type of regulation has lost the role it once had, as the emphasis has moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no minimum reserve ratio. The purpose of minimum reserve ratios is liquidity rather than safety. An example of a country with a contemporary minimum reserve ratio is Hong Kong, where banks are required to maintain 25% of their liabilities that are due on demand or within 1 month as qualifying liquefiable assets. Reserve requirements have also been used in the past to control the stock of banknotes and/or bank deposits. Required reserves have at times been gold, central bank banknotes or deposits, and foreign currency. =Corporate governance= Corporate governance requirements are intended to encourage the bank to be well managed, and is an indirect way of achieving other objectives. As many banks are relatively large, and with many divisions, it is important for management to maintain a close watch on all operations. Investors and clients will often hold higher management accountable for missteps, as these individuals are expected to be aware of all activities of the institution. Some of these requirements may include: * to be a body corporate (i.e. not an individual, a partnership, trust or other unincorporated entity) * to be incorporated locally, and/or to be incorporated under as a particular type of body corporate, rather than being incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction * to have a minimum number of directors * to have an organizational structure that includes various offices and officers, e.g. corporate secretary, treasurer/CFO, auditor, Asset Liability Management Committee, Privacy Officer, Compliance Officer etc. Also the officers for those offices may need to be approved persons, or from an approved class of persons * to have a constitution or articles of association that is approved, or contains or does not contain particular clauses, e.g. clauses that enable directors to act other than in the best interests of the company (e.g. in the interests of a parent company) may not be allowed. =Financial reporting and disclosure requirements= Among the most important regulations that are placed on banking institutions is the requirement for disclosure of the bank's finances. Particularly for banks that trade on the public market, in the US for example the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires management to prepare annual financial statements according to a financial reporting standard, have them audited, and to register or publish them. Often, these banks are even required to prepare more frequent financial disclosures, such as Quarterly Disclosure Statements. The Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act of 2002 outlines in detail the exact structure of the reports that the SEC requires. In addition to preparing these statements, the SEC also stipulates that directors of the bank must attest to the accuracy of such financial disclosures. Thus, included in their annual reports must be a report of management on the company's internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include: a statement of management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company; management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the company's most recent fiscal year; a statement identifying the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting; and a statement that the registered public accounting firm that audited the company's financial statements included in the annual report has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Under the new rules, a company is required to file the registered public accounting firm's attestation report as part of the annual report. Furthermore, the SEC added a requirement that management evaluate any change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during a fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. =Credit rating requirement= Banks may be required to obtain and maintain a current credit rating from an approved credit rating agency, and to disclose it to investors and prospective investors. Also, banks may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating. These ratings are designed to provide color for prospective clients or investors regarding the relative risk that one assumes when engaging in business with the bank. The ratings reflect the tendencies of the bank to take on high risk endeavors, in addition to the likelihood of succeeding in such deals or initiatives. The rating agencies that banks are most strictly governed by, referred to as the \\"Big Three\\" are the Fitch Group, Standard and Poor's and Moody's. These agencies hold the most influence over how banks (and all public companies) are viewed by those engaged in the public market. In recent years, following the Great Recession, many economists have argued that these agencies face a serious conflict of interest in their core business model. Clients pay these agencies to rate their company based on their relative riskiness in the market. The question then is, to whom is the agency providing its service: the company or the market? European financial economics experts ‚Äì notably the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that European powers such as France and Germany pushed dogmatically and naively for the adoption of the \\"Basel II recommendations\\", adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself, to rely more than ever on the standardized assessments of \\"credit risk\\" marketed aggressively by two US credit rating agencies ‚Äì Moody's and S&P;, thus using public policy and ultimately taxpayers' money to strengthen anti-competitive duopolistic practices akin to exclusive dealing. Ironically, European governments have abdicated most of their regulatory authority in favor of a non-European, highly deregulated, private cartel.M. Nicolas J. Firzli, \\"A Critique of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\\" Revue Analyse Financi√®re, Nov. 10 2011 & Q2 2012 =Large exposures restrictions= Banks may be restricted from having imprudently large exposures to individual counterparties or groups of connected counterparties. Such limitation may be expressed as a proportion of the bank's assets or equity, and different limits may apply based on the security held and/or the credit rating of the counterparty. Restricting disproportionate exposure to high-risk investment prevents financial institutions from placing equity holders' (as well as the firm's) capital at an unnecessary risk. =Activity and affiliation restrictions= In the US in response to the Great depression of the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's under the New Deal enacted the Securities Act of 1933 and the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act (GSA), setting up a pervasive regulatory scheme for the public offering of securities and generally prohibiting commercial banks from underwriting and dealing in those securities. GSA prohibited affiliations between banks (which means bank- chartered depository institutions, that is, financial institutions that hold federally insured consumer deposits) and securities firms (which are commonly referred to as ‚Äúinvestment banks‚Äù even though they are not technically banks and do not hold federally insured consumer deposits); further restrictions on bank affiliations with non-banking firms were enacted in Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) and its subsequent amendments, eliminating the possibility that companies owning banks would be permitted to take ownership or controlling interest in insurance companies, manufacturing companies, real estate companies, securities firms, or any other non-banking company. As a result, distinct regulatory systems developed in the United States for regulating banks, on the one hand, and securities firms on the other.Carpenter, David H. and M. Maureen Murphy. \\"The ‚ÄúVolcker Rule‚Äù: Proposals to Limit ‚ÄúSpeculative‚Äù Proprietary Trading by Banks\\". Congressional Research Service, 2010. Too big to fail and moral hazard Among the reasons for maintaining close regulation of banking institutions is the aforementioned concern over the global repercussions that could result from a bank's failure; the idea that these bulge bracket banks are \\"too big to fail\\". The objective of federal agencies is to avoid situations in which the government must decide whether to support a struggling bank or to let it fail. The issue, as many argue, is that providing aid to crippled banks creates a situation of moral hazard. The general premise is that while the government may have prevented a financial catastrophe for the time being, they have reinforced confidence for high risk taking and provided an invisible safety net. This can lead to a vicious cycle, wherein banks take risks, fail, receive a bailout, and then continue to take risks once again.

It is a compilation of puzzles from Eggerland: Meiky≈´ no Fukkatsu and Eggerland: S≈çz≈ç he no Tabidachi. It was available on the Wii's and Wii U's Virtual Console in North America and in PAL regions, as well as on the Nintendo Switch Online's virtual Nintendo Entertainment System library. The game received a sequel, Adventures of Lolo 2, that was released in Japan as Adventures of Lolo. Premise and gameplay The player assumes the role of Lolo and attempts to rescue Princess Lala, who has been kidnapped by the evil King Egger. Lolo travels to Egger's castle, with 50 rooms arranged in 10 floors of five. Within each room, Lolo must collect several hearts in order to open a treasure chest and collect the gem inside, which will open the exit to the next room or floor. The player must navigate the obstacles in each room and avoid or neutralize several different types of enemies, which vary by movement and attack pattern. All enemies disappear once Lolo picks up the gem. The player can move, slide certain blocks around the screen, and fire a limited number of shots at enemies. When an enemy is shot, it becomes encased in an egg for a short time; this can be pushed to a new location, used as a bridge to cross water, or shot again to make it disappear temporarily. Lolo can gain other powers on specific screens, such as the ability to smash rocks or build a bridge. Some enemies are not affected by Lolo's shots. One life is lost whenever Lolo is shot or touched by certain enemies. Others will not kill him, but can impede his movement by standing still or freezing in place when touched. The player can restart a screen at any time, at the cost of one life. Development and release Adventures of Lolo was developed and published by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America on 20 April 1989 and in Europe in February 1991. A Nintendo representative commented that Nintendo was \\"trying to stretch the kids' imaginations\\" with Lolo. It was re- released for the Wii's Virtual Console on 8 June 2007 in North America and on 6 August 2007 in PAL regions. It was also re-released for the Wii U's Virtual Console by Nintendo in North America on 15 May 2014 and in PAL regions on 21 August 2014 as well as for the Nintendo 3DS in PAL regions on 16 October 2014 and in North America on 8 January 2015, and then re-released again for the Nintendo Switch's Virtual Console in December of 2018. Reception Adventures of Lolo has received positive reception from critics and fans alike. Lolos success was surprising to its developer HAL Laboratory. Game, Set, Watchs Todd Ciolek called it the \\"leader of the [block-shoving] movement\\", garnering a cult following. IGN called it one of Satoru Iwata's successes, describing it as something that was \\"all about fun, appeal and simplicity over an abundance of bells and whistles\\". The Toronto Star listed it as one of their recommended NES games for children. Eurogamers Dan Whitehead praised it for not being \\"yet another cutesy platformer\\", calling it a \\"diverting casual game\\". He stated that it wasn't a \\"classic title that everyone should rush to own\\", but it was still a quality title. Writer Justin McElroy commented that he had fond memories of it, and has no worry of how well it has aged since its release on the NES, feeling that puzzle games stay \\"enjoyable forever\\"; however, he criticized the music, saying that its looping drove players \\"ever closer to the dark edge of madness.\\" GameSpots Frank Provo called it addictive, commenting that the gameplay holds up in the current day. He added that while the characters were cute, the graphics were simple, and that the game could be finished in one day. Wireds Chris Kohler called its Virtual Console release a \\"tempting choice\\". IGN's Cam Shea said that it wasn't worth paying for, though it had more value than many other Virtual Console titles. IGN's Levi Buchanan named it one of the best Virtual Console titles, stating that it will last for hours. Author Steven Schwartz called Lolo a strategic game, and that players who have successfully done logic problems in magazines would have an easier time with this game. Similarly, Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune called it a \\"challenge of logic, not brute force\\", as well as \\"addictive\\". He also noted that Lolo was a game that would appeal to both genders. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish called it a great puzzle game, calling it \\"highly recommended\\" due to its combination of its complexity and simplicity. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas felt that it would be intriguing to fans of puzzle-action games, calling it \\"simple on the surface, but deceptively complex once you get going\\". GameSpy's Benjamin Turner commented that it was \\"hard as hell\\", and would \\"put any Mensa member to the test\\". Fellow GameSpy writer Christian Nutt bemoaned HAL for abandoning Lolo for Kirby. Nintendo Life's Darren Calvert called its level designs \\"ingenious\\", commenting that they will \\"tax the old grey matter\\". Nintendo World Report's Michael Cole commented that its gameplay remained fresh in its Wii release, as well as \\"approachable\\". Adventures of Lolos gameplay has been compared to several other video games by critics. GamePros Heidi Kemps compared Ivy the Kiwi?s gameplay to Lolos. Selby Bateman of Game Players magazine compared the adventurous experience of Lolo to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, calling the former more sophisticated. 1UP.com's Kevin Gifford compared it to Wrecking Crew. IGN compared Kickle Cubicle to Lolo, though noting that it was easier. Writer Danny Cowan compared the video game Roll Away was similar to the \\"find the key/find the exit\\" gameplay of Lolo. It has also been the inspiration for other video games; video game developer Ryan Clark attributed the inspiration for his video game Professor Fizzwizzle in part to Adventures of Lolo. LIT developer Adam Tierney drew inspiration for LIT from Lolo. =Legacy= Adventures of Lolo was followed by two sequels for the NES: Adventures of Lolo 2 and Adventures of Lolo 3 in 1990 and 1991, respectively. A Game Boy follow- up was released in 1994 with the same name (it is known in Japan as Lolo no Daibouken). Lolo and Lala, the game's protagonists, have appeared under the monikers Lololo and Lalala in Kirby's Dream Land and later in its adaptation in Kirby Super Star, as well as in Kirby's Avalanche, where they play an antagonistic role. Both game series are made by HAL Laboratory, Inc..

The high power of the locomotive at an acceptably low axleload resulted in 22 similar locomotives being ordered by British Railways for use on East Coast Main Line express passenger services; the serial production of which became the British Rail Class 55. Background and design The English Electric company, which had absorbed the engine-maker Napier & Son into its group at the instruction of the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1942, was a major builder of diesel and electric locomotives. The two George Nelsons (Sir George, and his son, known in the works as \\"Half\\") saw the potential of Napier's Deltic engine for rail traction and in 1954‚Äì1955 built a demonstrator at its Dick, Kerr works in Preston. Officially numbered DP1, its internal project title was Enterprise, and it was intended that the locomotive would carry that name. However, in 1954, before completion, Hudswell Clarke announced a range of small diesel-mechanical locomotives using the same name. After initial trials in 1955, the locomotive received the DELTIC in large cream letters on its sides, and the name became synonymous with the locomotive. Long aluminium beadings on the sides were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive's high sides appear more slender and add to the impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each nose, in the same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive's bulldog nose styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD F-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight was to have been fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating 'Mars Light' type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, derated from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total. This derating reduced the stress on the engines, thereby increasing the service life and length of time between overhauls. Service and testing The locomotive first saw service on the London Midland Region of British Railways in 1955, generally operating fast London to Liverpool freight trains; it was withdrawn and after modifications re-entered services in 1956. Tests were carried out on the Settle to Carlisle line in August/September 1956, after which it operated passenger trains, The Shamrock and The Merseyside Express, between London and Liverpool, followed by London-Carlisle trains, and in 1957, returning to London-Liverpool trains. The region's chief mechanical and electrical engineer, J.F.Harrison, rejected the design, believing high-speed engines (i.e. 1500 rpm) unsuitable for railway applications.The West Coast Main Line was subsequently electrified, starting in 1959. In 1957, Gerry Fiennes, the line traffic manager on the former Great Northern route out of London King's Cross station, was seeking high power locomotives to run services on the East Coast Main Line, having found the 2000 hp English Electric type 4 locomotives produced under the 1955 modernisation plan lacking sufficient power for his planned timings; as a consequence he proposed using 'Deltic' type locomotives on the line. Objections to the order included those arising from: a limited permitted top speed due to the mass of the locomotive; the potential for the order to delay a proposed (1957) electrification scheme of the line; as well the size which required modifications to the King's Cross platforms. An order was placed in 1959 for 22 Class 55s to replace 55 steam locomotives. =Preservation= DP1 at the Ribble Steam Railway in 2015 In March 1961 DP1 was withdrawn after a serious powerplant failure; plans to test it in Canada fell through, and the locomotive was donated in 1963 to the Science Museum, South Kensington and placed on public display. In October 1993, it was transferred to the National Railway Museum, York.\\"Deltic Breaks Out\\" The Railway Magazine issue 1112 December 1993 pages 5‚Äì7 It then moved to the National Railway Museum Shildon. In August 2012 it was loaned to The Ribble Steam Railway in Preston, Lancashire, which is barely a mile away from where it was originally built where it was due to stay until at least October 2015 but as of May 2020 it was back at Shildon. Models The Kitmaster company produced an unpowered polystyrene injection moulded model kit for 00 gauge. In late 1962, the Kitmaster brand was sold by its parent company (Rosebud Dolls) to Airfix, who did not release model kits of this locomotive. In time, the Airfix tools passed on to Dapol who rediscovered the moulding tools and have since produced the model kit. In 2007 model manufacturer Bachmann Branchline and the National Railway Museum announced the release of an OO scale model of the DP1 for sale at the NRM Shop. Bachmann used laser- scanning (see 3D scanner) of the machine at the National Railway Museum Shildon to collect dimensional data of the locomotive.

Action Quake 2 was developed to recreate the look and feel of an action movie, having a fast pace and a semi-realistic damage system. It features many maps recreating realistic settings, such as city streets and office buildings, with a balanced range of weapons and equipment inspired by action movies. Action Quake 2 is essentially a version of deathmatch and team deathmatch in which most of the classic elements have been modified to some degree. Damage to extremities such as a shot to the leg with any weapon will cause damage and bleeding, along with crippling the player's movement until they bandage themselves. Originally released in 1998, there was still an active community of players as of 2015.  Overview  In-game screenshot. With a then unique style of play, realistic weapons and fast pace, Action Quake 2 became one of the most popular Quake II mods. The mod caught the attention of id Software in June 1998, who wished to include it in their upcoming Quake II: Internet Pack No. 1 (Netpack 1): Extremities, a commercial add-on product for Quake II. This expansion CD was released in the U.S. on November 26, 1998, included was the final version 1.0c of Action Quake, along with 11 other publicly available mods, a collection of Quake 2 deathmatch maps, and player skins. Members of the development team would later go on to work on titles such as Action Half- Life and Counter-Strike.  Gameplay  There are two main modes of gameplay in Action Quake 2: Deathmatch (Free For All) and Teamplay. In Deathmatch, spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and players battle out in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the timelimit is reached (and whoever has the most frags \\"wins\\"), or the fraglimit is reached (and whoever reaches it \\"wins\\"). By default, each player spawns with only pistol, and a combat knife. Additional equipment can be picked up throughout the map, but in Action Quake 2 DM all weapons other than pistols, knives, and grenades are \\"unique\\", meaning that only one exists on that map at any time. In Teamplay, players are split into two teams and play is round based. Players select one primary weapon and one item to use, in addition to the default pistol and knife. The teams spawn on opposite sides of the map and are then let loose to kill each other. If one team eliminates the other, they win the round.

The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. . was a Khitan who founded the Qutlugh-Khanid dynasty in the southern Persian province of Kirman the early 13th century after the conquest of the sinicised Central Asian Qara Khitai by the Mongol Empire. Buraq Hajib's Kirmani Qara Khitai Khanate ended in the 14th century. Origin The Khitan in northern China were known as ÿÆÿ∑ÿß in Arabic (Khata) and are mentioned by Muslim chroniclers as having fought against Muslims and founded the Qara Khitai. After the destruction of the Qara Khitai realm by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in 1218, the former land of the Qara Khitai became absorbed into the Mongol Empire. A small part of the population under Buraq Hajib settled in the Persian province of Kirman, converted to Islam, and established a local dynasty there. Early years Buraq Hajib is thought to be a member of Qara Khitai dynasty and a son of a Khitan noble Kulduz. Buraq Hajib and his brother Hamƒ´d Pur (or Khan Tem√ºr) Tayangu were detained or captured by Muhammad of Khwarezm in 1210, and were given important posts. He was initially in the service of Khwarazm prince Ghiyas-ad-Din Purshah, under whom he was nicknamed Qutlugh Khan. He was soon appointed as the commander of Isfahan for Khwarazmshahs. He arrived at Kerman at first as a commander of Purshah's army, joining him in the battle against Salghurid atabeg Sa'd I. However, he had an argument with Purshah's vizier Tajaddin Karim ash-Sharq and left for India hearing approachment of a Mongol army under command of Tolun Cherbi (step-son of Hoelun). While on his way to India, Buraq was attacked by the local governor of Kirman - Shuja ad-Din Abul-Qasim, but Buraq managed to defeat him thanks to defection of Turks and decided to start a siege of Kirman. He had submit to Jalal ad-Din at first, offering her daughter's hand, who in turn helped him to conquer Kirman. He quickly got involved in local politics, aiding Nasrid emir Ali b. Harb in his struggle to throne in 1225.  Reign  In 1228 Khwarazm prince Ghiyas-ad-Din Purshah sought refuge in Kirman after incurring the wrath of his brother, Sultan Jalal ad-Din. Using favorable situation, Buraq forced him to give his mother's hand, marrying her. After a revelation of conspiracy involving two Khitan nobles and Ghiyas-ad-Din. he and his mother was soon murdered by Buraq. Sometime later Buraq converted to Islam and requested the Abbasid Caliph for investiture and was granted a title of Qutlugh Sultan. His next action was to ally to Atabegs of Yazd through marriage. Buraq later submitted to the Mongol Empire, and he and his successors were conferred the title of Qutlugh Khan, and allowed to ruled as vassal of the Mongols. Throughout its rule the dynasty continued to be known as Qara Khitai. There were a total of 9 rulers of the Kirmanid dynasty, two of whom were female. He sent his son Rukn al-Din Mubarak Khwaja to √ñgedei's court just before his death in 1234/5. He was succeeded by his nephew Qutb al-Din Mohammad.  Family  He had at least two wives - a widow of Muhammad II of Khwarazm and Uka Khatun. His only son was Rukn al-Din Mubarak Khwaja who was born of Uka Khatun. Kutlugh Turkan was probably one of his concubines, although according to Fatema Mernissi she was his daughter Khan Turkan (see below). He had at least 4 daughters: * A daughter - married to Jalal ad-Din * Sevinch Khatun - married to Chagatai * Khan Turkan - married to his nephew Qutb al-Din Mohammad. According to Vladimir Minorsky, her identity was mistaken for Kutlugh Turkan. * Yaqut Turkan - married to Mahmud Shah (r. 1229-1241), Atabeg of Yazd * Maryam Turkan - married to Mohyi al-Din, nephew of Sam ibn Wardanruz, Atabeg of Yazd See also *Qara Khitai *Mongol invasion of Central Asia References Further reading Converts to Islam Mongol khans Qara Khitai people Mongol rulers 13th century in Iran 13th-century Mongolian people 1234 deaths ","title":"Buraq Hajib"},{"id":"1198378","text":"Casa de Piedra may refer to: * Casa de Piedra, La Paz, Catamarca, Argentina * Casa de Piedra, Santa Mar√≠a, Catamarca, Argentina * Casa de Piedra, La Pampa, Argentina * Casa de Piedra (Aguadilla, Puerto Rico), a historical building * The Thacher School, nicknamed Casa de Piedra, in Ojai, California, United States ","title":"Casa de Piedra"},{"id":"1198383","text":"is a Japanese company founded in 1948, originally to produce vacuum tubes.

It took over the Goole and Marshland Railway, running from Marshland Junction near to and , and the Isle of Axholme Light Railway, running from Reedness Junction to . Construction of the Goole and Marshland Railway had begun in 1898, and by the time of the takeover in early 1903, was virtually complete. The Isle of Axholme Light Railway was started in 1899, but only the section from Reedness Junction to was complete at the takeover. The northern section opened in November 1903, and the line from Crowle to Haxey Junction opened for passengers on 2 January 1905. A branch to Hatfield Moor was opened in 1909, but traffic from the peat works at Hatfield did not start to use the railway until 1913, when the company extended their line into the works. Traffic was mainly agricultural produce, together with peat from Hatfield Moor and from Swinefleet Peat Works which processed peat from Thorne Moors. Passenger services ceased in 1933, although occasional excursion trains continued to be run. The Haxey Junction to section closed in 1956, the Hatfield Moor Branch closed in 1964, and the remainder closed in 1965. However, most of the tracks were retained and operated as a long siding, to allow it to be used to carry heavy parts from Keadby Power Station across the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, as the bridge on the A161 road could not support the weight. The road bridge was replaced in 1970, and the rails were finally removed in 1972. History The Isle of Axholme lies to the west of the River Trent and to the east of Hatfield Chase, a vast area of low-lying land which was described as a badly drained swamp in the 1620s. It was recorded as Axeyholme, with the three syllables Ax-ey-holme meaning water-island-island being contributed by successive groups of Celts, Angles and Danes. In the reign of King Charles I, the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden set about draining Hatfield Chase, containing some of wetland, in 1626. The River Don, River Torne and River Idle were re-routed and re-channelled, and although there were some flaws in the initial scheme, and considerable social unrest, including damage of the drainage works, the unrest was finally resolved in 1719, and the agriculture of the area prospered. The Stainforth and Keadby Canal cut across the region in 1802, providing some transport facilities, but the coming of the railway age resulted in calls for railways to be built to carry the agricultural produce to market. =Precursors= The South Yorkshire Railway built a line which ran broadly parallel to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, passing through . Two plans for railways from London to York, which would have crossed the Isle, were proposed but not built, while the more local Isle of Axholme Extension Railway would have linked Haxey, Epworth, Crowle and Thorne. In 1846, the railway financier George Hudson proposed a line from Goole to be called the Isle of Axholme, Gainsborough and York and North Midland Junction Railway, which failed to obtain an Act of Parliament, but much of its route was used by the railway which did eventually get built. In 1882, the Isle of Axholme and Marshland Steam Tramway was proposed. It would run from Haxey to Crowle, and would use a gauge of . However, in 1883 the company joined forces with, and was then taken over by, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway to resist a proposal for the Goole, Epworth and Owston Railway. The defeat of the rival scheme was resented by local businessmen. Under an Act of Parliament obtained in 1885, the tramway was abandoned and the Isle of Axholme Railway was authorised, but this too was abandoned three years later by another Act. Nothing more happened, until the passing of the Light Railways Act in 1896, which meant that rural railways could be authorised by an order from the Board of Trade, rather than having to obtain a costly Act of Parliament. =Proposals= The Goole and Marshland Light Railway was one of the first to take advantage of the new Act. A public enquiry held in Goole on 8 October 1897 showed that the plans, which would cost ¬£59,602 to implement, had local support, and the farmers club estimated that the railway would carry 51,625 tons of agricultural produce per year. An order enabling construction to proceed was issued on 16 August 1898. It sanctioned four railways and a road. Leaving the Doncaster to Goole main line (Hull and Doncaster Branch), a line composed of two of the railways ran to Adlingfleet via , and there were branches to Swinefleet and Luddington. of road were needed to provide access to the railway. The maximum speed was restricted to , and locomotives with tenders were not allowed to run tender- first. The Isle of Axholme Light Railway was proposed in 1897, running from to Crowle via and . At Haxey, it would join the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway, while at Crowle it would pass over and also connect to the Great Central Railway, and would join The Goole and Marshland Light Railway at . Two branches, to Hatfield Moor and Newlands, were proposed. Like its northern neighbour, the plans had strong local support, and a Light Railway Order was granted on 11 March 1899. A request by the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company that the swing bridge over the Canal near Crowle should be maintained in the open position to allow free passage of boats, rather than in the closed position to prefer the railway, was refused, as was an application for running powers over the line by the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway. Neither railway remained independent for long. Both were negotiating with the North Eastern Railway by January 1900, and agreement was reached that the larger railway would run both of the new lines, also representing them at the Railway Clearing House. As well as the agricultural traffic, the route would provide access to coal from the South Yorkshire coalfields. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway also needed routes into the coalfields, and the two companies agreed with the two new railways on a takeover plan. The North Eastern Railway Act of 31 July 1902 dissolved, transferred to and vested both companies in the North Eastern and the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway companies jointly, with three directors appointed by each company. They paid ¬£73,500 for the Goole and Marshland line, which had been completed, and ¬£27,500 for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway, which was still in the early stages of construction. =Construction= Construction of the Goole and Marshland Light Railway began on 22 September 1898 at Eastoft, where the first sod was cut by the chairman, William Halkon. There was some initial disagreement with the North Eastern Railway over Marshland Junction, but this was resolved in December, and the first section of the virtually flat railway was opened from Marshland Junction to Reedness Junction on 8 January 1900, initially for goods traffic only. A locomotive and two open wagons were used to form a Directors' train to inspect the line to Eastoft on 26 June, and the North Eastern Railway carried out a survey in December before purchasing the line. At the time, the railway was open as far at , and the final section to Garthorpe was expected to be laid within a month. Eastoft station was completed, and the NER expected Reedness Junction, Luddington and Garthorpe stations to be finished to a similar standard. Garthorpe station was eventually renamed . The railway claimed its first lives when two contractor's locomotives collided in thick fog near Eastoft on 4 January 1901. Both of the locomotives were damaged, and the crew of one were scalded when the boiler tubes burst. The driver died the following day, and the stoker a few days after that. Another inspection train was run on 26 June 1901, starting from Reedness Junction and visiting, according to the Crowle Advertiser, Creyke Siding, Garthorpe and Crowle. The train consisted of two first-class carriages and an open truck. A dinner was held at the Darby and Joan Hotel in Crowle, before the party returned to Reedness. Although Creyke siding was mentioned, this term was normally applied to a siding serving Creyke's peat works on the North Eastern Railway main line to the south of Marshland Junction. Belton station in 1961, shortly before closure of the line The cutting of the first sod for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway was an altogether grander occasion. It took place on 20 July 1899, and was reported at great length in the Epworth Bells newspaper. The ceremony was performed by Miss Bletcher, the daughter of one of the Directors, after which a luncheon for a large number of people was held in a marquee. Following speeches, about 400 children were given a free tea in the Temperance Hall, while adults were catered for in the schoolrooms of four local chapels. Sports were then held, watched by a crowd of 1,500, and finally there was a fireworks display. Most of the children later received a commemorative medal. Construction proceeded slowly, to the extent that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902. By the end of 1902, the section from Crowle to Reedness Junction was finished, as was the line from Epworth to Haxey Junction. The railways became part of the Axholme Joint Railway in early 1903, and the northern sections, from Marshland Junction to Fockerby and Crowle, were opened for passengers and goods on 19 November 1903. Only Crowle swing bridge remained to be finished by March 1904, and the southern section opened for goods traffic on 14 November. The Board of Trade required several improvements to be made before it passed the line as suitable for passengers, and the formal opening took place on 2 January 1905. The work had involved excavating of earth to form the cuttings between Epworth and Haxey, and another had been used to construct the embankments by Crowle swing bridge. of bricks and of concrete had also been used. Since 17 February 1904, the official name of the undertaking had been the Isle of Axholme Joint Railway (NE and L&Y; Joint). =Hatfield Moor branch= An application for a light railway order for the Hatfield Moor Extension Light Railway was made in November 1904, and was granted on 5 August 1905. The contract to build it was given to John Moffat of Manchester on 27 September 1907, and the contract price was ¬£14,649. Construction took one and a half years, and the branch opened on 1 March 1909. Because the area through which it ran is low-lying, and had been the subject of drainage schemes since 1626, the railway had several bridges over rivers and drains. Between Epworth and Sandtoft goods station, it crossed the Folly Drain, the New Idle River and the River Torne. Beyond the station it crossed the North Idle Drain, and then ran along the bank of the Hatfield Waste Drain to reach its terminus at Hatfield Moor, close to the Hatfield Peat Works, then owned by the British Moss Litter Company (BMLC). Facilities were limited, with a borehole deep supplying a water column at Sandtoft, and a run-round loop with a lever frame at Hatfield Moor, where the staff consisted of a single porter. Traffic was agricultural, but the Railway Company hoped to obtain the peat traffic. They held discussions in September 1909, but the BMLC continued to transport their peat overland to Maud's Bridge goods yard, on the Doncaster to Scunthorpe line. The Axholme Joint Railway then built a loading dock for the peat, which was completed in December 1911, but still did not succeed in getting the peat traffic. An agreement was eventually made in April 1913, which required the Railway Company to extend their line into the peat works. When completed, all peat left the works on the Axholme Joint Railway. It continued to serve the works until 30 September 1963, and was formally closed on 29 February 1964. There was a siding from the main line to Swinefleet Works, which was also owned by the British Moss Litter Company. The works had a steam railway which ran northwards from the works to the banks of the River Ouse at Swinefleet Clough. The line crossed the intended route of the Reedness Junction to Fockerby Branch, and the North Eastern Railway met with the BMLC in October 1902, hoping that they could persuade them to waive their right to a level crossing, in return for a payment. The exact outcome is not clear, but a siding was laid into the works, which was operational from 10 August 1903, and the peat railway was lifted at about that time. Peat was brought to the works by a network of railways spreading out southwards across Thorne Moors. =Operation= Passenger traffic was sparse through most of the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a separate train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed. Motor buses appeared in the district from 1924, and passenger numbers dropped. Cheap fares and a steam railcar did not halt the decline, although in the last days of operation, five trains were run on Saturdays, three on Wednesdays and two on other weekdays. The last trains ran on 15 July 1933, with all passenger services suspended from Monday 17 July. In addition to timetabled services, excursions were run, with Epworth, the birthplace of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism being popular. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway published a booklet entitled Epworth: What to see and how to get there to entice people to travel there from Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Excursions from the Isle of Axholme to Blackpool were popular, with over 600 passengers on such a trip in 1913, and 750 visiting the Great Yorkshire Show at Hull in 1922. Excursions to Blackpool continued to be run even after timetabled passenger services were withdrawn. Early freight traffic consisted of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with large volumes of peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic into the area included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole of the number of wagons they would need for consignments of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began to take some of the trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day. =Closure= The line closed to passengers on 15 July 1933. The section from Haxey Junction to Epworth was closed on 1 February 1956, by which time most of the traffic was peat, supplemented by seasonal sugar-beet. The branch to Hatfield Moors was rarely used from 1962, when small diesel locomotives had replaced steam traction, and was closed on 30 September 1963. The rest of the system closed on 5 April 1965. Although closed, the line was not lifted, and was maintained as a long siding until 1972, on behalf of the Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972. Route The Goole and Marshland Light Railway ran from Marshland Junction, south east of Goole on the North Eastern Railway Hull to Thorne line, to Reedness Junction with a branch line from Reedness to Fockerby on the River Trent estuary. The junction with the North Eastern Railway faced Goole, and all traffic started from or proceeded to Goole. Since the railway served the needs of the agricultural community, there were many sidings, where wagons could be stored for loading and unloading. On the first section, these were Plumtree Farm siding, Dougherty's siding, Corner's siding, Smith's siding, Glossop's siding, and Goole Fields siding, before the railway crossed over Swinefleet Warping Drain on a steel girder bridge to reach Reedness station. Between Smith's and Glossop's sidings, the track was crossed by a tramway owned by the British Moss Litter Company and used for conveying peat. The tramway had been built in 1896, and a ground frame was installed to control conflicting train movements. The NER proposed that the tramway should be cut in two, with each half extended westwards, to run alongside Smith's siding and a new siding opposite it on the other side of the main line, but this was rejected. In 1905 they proposed a tunnel under their line, with gradients on the tramway not exceeding 1 in 20 on both sides. Although agreements were drawn up, the plan does not appear to have been implemented. The tramway was of narrow gauge, was about long, and used a steam locomotive. It served Old Goole Mill, although further details of either the mill or the locomotive have not been found. Although the mill closed soon after 1902, it was used for storing peat until 1914, and the tracks were not lifted until many years later. In 1903, some twelve trains per day crossed over the Axholme Joint Railway on the tramway. The bridge over Swinefleet Warping Drain was the subject of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked permission for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need to walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident. At Reedness, the Fockerby Branch turned to the north, and the Axholme Light Railway route swung to the south. Reedness Junction had a brick-built water tower, a house for the station master, and sidings to the north, accessible from the Fockerby Branch. It was some from the village centre of Swinefleet, and from Reedness village. The Branch was long. Blackers siding and Whitgift siding were passed before the line reached Eastoft station, which was north of the village centre. There were two sidings to the north. After crossing the road beside the Adlingfleet Drain, the proposed line to Adlinfleet would have continued beside the drain, but the line to Fockerby as built turned to the south-east. It passed Boltgate siding to reach Luddington station, with two sidings to the south, but still from the village. Next came Pindar's siding, after which the line curved to the north to reach Fockerby, where there were two sidings and a run-around loop. Returning to Reedness Junction, the line started as the Axholme Light Railway ran from there to Haxey. After Moor's Farm siding, Peat Moss Works siding, which serviced Swinefleet Peat Works, and Spilman's siding, the line reached Crowle. Here there was a passing loop and three sidings to the west. To the south of the station was Ealand Depot, with two sidings, which were added after representations were made by farmers. Beyond, the line rose on an embankment to Crowle swing bridge, crossing three brick arches over a road and a drain, a girder bridge over the Scunthorpe to Doncaster main line, and another brick arch as it approached. The main girders were long, and the bridge was built by the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington. To the south of it was a twelve-arched viaduct known as Crowle Arches, which crossed the Hatfield Waste Drain, the North Engine Drain, the River Torne and the A18 road, and beyond that, another nine-arched viaduct spanning the South Engine Drain and the Folly Drain, beyond which the railway started to descend to return to ground level. Hagg Lane siding, near the village of Belton, was next, from where John Blether agreed to forward 2,500 tons per year. Using Army-surplus equipment from the First World War, he built of gauge tramway in 1920 to bring produce from his farm to the sidings. The length of track was gradually extended to , and the wagons were pulled by horses. Usage declined after the Second World War, and the tramway was closed in 1953. Belton station had a passing loop, with three sidings and a loading dock, which was used for sugar-beet traffic. The station was regularly used by the photographer J. Bottomley in the 1920s, who would arrive with his photographic caravan loaded on a truck, and recorded life in the district. A brickworks and clay pit were served by the next siding. It was not constructed until 1936, and continued in use until the line closed. The line rose on an embankment to cross the A161 road, and then entered a cutting, where it was joined by the Hatfield Moors branch, the two running parallel for some before the cutting became an embankment, and they joined near Epworth station. Epworth had a passing loop and sidings to the east, with the track crossing the High Street on a brick bridge to the south of the station. Next came Burnham Lane siding, and then a high embankment, pierced by two brick bridges, which were wide enough for double track, although they only ever carried a single track, followed by another deep cutting. Haxey station had a passing loop and three sidings. It was originally called Haxey Central, and then Haxey Town AJR, and eventually became Haxey Town. The line continued on an embankment, crossed Ferry Drain and Warping Drain by a brick bridge, and turned to the south-east to reach the terminus at Haxey Junction Station. The adjacent station on the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway line between Doncaster and Gainsborough, to which it was connected by a line which required two reversals, was called . Marshland Junction to Haxey was a distance of , although working timetables normally showed the distance from Goole, which was from Haxey. The freight-only branch from Epworth to Hatfield Moors was long. Motive power During the construction of the two railways, three contractors locomotives worked on the Goole and Marshland Railway, and four on the Isle of Axholme Light Railway. All were built by the Manning Wardle company in Leeds. The first, named Margaret, was an 0-4-0 saddle tank with outside cylinders, while the remainder, built to four different designs, were 0-6-0 saddle tanks with inside cylinders. None were owned by the two railways, and five of them were auctioned at a sale of contractors' plant held at Crowle Wharf in October 1904. Once the contractors' locomotives ceased working on the line, locomotives were supplied from Goole shed, and were usually Barton Wright 0-6-2 side tanks or Barton Wright 0-6-0 goods engines with tenders. The locomotives took their name from William Barton Wright, who was the chief mechanical engineer for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at the time they were introduced. They were designed and built by Kitson and Company in Leeds. Although classified as goods engines, the 0-6-0 locomotives were employed on both goods and passenger services. They continued to work on the line until the early 1960s. Most of the 0-6-2s had been withdrawn by 1914, and their duties were performed by Aspinall 2-4-2 side tanks. A Sentinel- Cammell steam railcar of the same type as the one which worked on the Axholme Joint Railway. In 1907, the company looked at using petrol-electric autocars for the passenger services, but were advised that they would not be economic, as conventional trains would still be required on Wednesdays and Saturdays to cope with the volume of traffic. However, in July 1926 they conducted trials with a Sentinel-Cammell steam railcar, which was borrowed from the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), who had absorbed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, bought 13 steam railcars in 1926 and 1927, one of which was allocated to Goole shed for work on the Axholme Joint Railway. A similar vehicle was ordered in February 1930 specifically for the railway, and entered service in December. The steam power unit was built by the Sentinel Waggon Works in Shrewsbury, and the bodywork was built at Nottingham, at the former works of Cammell Laird, by then part of the Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. Before passenger services were withdrawn in 1933, it ran , working two return trips from Goole to Haxey Junction on weekdays, three on Wednesdays, and five on Saturdays. It was then sold to the LNER and continued in use until 1944. From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 lightweight tender locomotives were allocated to Goole shed, and were soon operating on the Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield and all of the seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for the cab, and was low enough to provide good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962. Although there were no passenger services after 1933, occasional rail tours ran along the line. The last passenger train was a 4-car diesel multiple unit, hired by the North Axholme Secondary School at Crowle on 1 April 1965. It left Goole at 11:30 am, carrying 184 pupils, members of staff, invited guests and the press. Passing through Reedness Junction, the train ran to Fockerby, where it was met by pupils from Garthorpe Primary School. It then returned to Reedness, and followed the route through Crowle to Epworth, by then the terminus. It returned to Ealand siding, where some of the passengers left the train, and the rest detrained at Crowle. The average speed for the journey was .

She is best known as a frequent writing collaborator with Leonard Cohen,Discogs ‚Äì Sharon Robinson profile and discography although she has written songs for a number of other artists as well, including The Pointer Sisters, Aaron Neville, Brenda Russell, Diana Ross, Don Henley, Michael Bolton, Randy Crawford, Patti LaBelle, Roberta Flack, The Temptations, Bettye LaVette and others. Biography Robinson excelled in school, and as a National Merit semi-finalist she earned a scholarship to Salem College in West Virginia. Halfway to her degree, money and music proved a stronger draw, so she left school to front a touring top-40 band for several years. Burnout on the road brought her back to college; this time to the California Institute of the Arts to study music. She toured as back-up singer for Cohen in 1979 and 1980, and then again during 2008‚Äì2013. They collaborated on writing the songs \\"Everybody Knows\\" and \\"Waiting for the Miracle\\", released in 1988 and 1992 respectively. In 2001 she co-wrote, produced, arranged and performed the backing tracks (as well as appearing alongside Cohen on the cover) for his album Ten New Songs. Robinson also contributed to three tracks on Cohen's 2004 album Dear Heather, and duetted with Cohen on \\"The Letters\\". She was awarded a Grammy in 1985 for the song \\"New Attitude\\" (from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack), recorded by Patti LaBelle. In 2004, Robinson gave a full-length interview discussing her life, career and work with Leonard Cohen. In 2005, Robinson wrote the song \\"The High Road\\" specifically for Bettye LaVette for her album I've Got My Own Hell to Raise, which was picked as #59 at Amazon's best of 2005 Editor's picks. Robinson's recent work also includes the songs written for Chris Botti. Sharon Robinson on stage with Leonard Cohen during concert at Edinburgh Castle, July 16, 2008 In 2008, Robinson released her debut solo album Everybody Knows, which includes three songs she co-wrote with Cohen: \\"Alexandra Leaving\\", \\"Everybody Knows\\", and \\"Summertime\\", their first collaboration, originally recorded by Diana Ross for her 1987 album Red Hot Rhythm & Blues. The set also includes \\"The High Road\\", and six new tracks written by Robinson. On October 27, 2008, Vibrant Records released Everybody Knows in the United Kingdom and Europe, replacing the original artwork from Leonard Cohen with a photo of Robinson. In February 2009, Vibrant Records closed due to the bankruptcy of its distributor Pinnacle. In April 2009, UK label Freeworld Records re-released Everybody Knows in Europe with the original Leonard Cohen-drawn cover art. Robinson self-released the album in the U.S. In 2008 Robinson joined The Leonard Cohen World Tour which lasted until December 2013. In August 2013 she was profiled in a cover story in the Financial Times. A book of her photographs was released in December 2014 along with exhibits in New York and Los Angeles, and performances in those cities and Toronto. Sharon Robinson appeared on Cohen's 2012 album Old Ideas singing, arranging choirs and playing synth bass on four tracks. Robinson performed songs from both her albums and also songs she co-wrote with Cohen on a tour in March and April 2015, coinciding with the release of her second solo album, entitled Caffeine, singing in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Ireland, Scotland and England. Caffeine included 10 new tracks written and produced by Sharon Robinson herself, with one song, \\"Lucky\\", co-written with Cohen in the 1980s but not recorded. In 2015 Robinson released a four-track EP titled Sharon Robinson EP 1, with the songs by Tom Waits, Otis Redding, Bruce Hornsby, and Eric Clapton. After her second 2015 tour was postponed, she toured in Europe again in August and September 2016. In August 2016, she was the guest of honor at the 10th Leonard Cohen Event, held in Amsterdam.

Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species. Most species within the class Phaeophyceae are predominantly cold- water organisms that benefit from nutrients upwelling, but the genus Sargassum appears to be an exception. Any number of the normally benthic species may take on a planktonic, often pelagic existence after being removed from reefs during rough weather; however, two species (S. natans and S. fluitans) have become holopelagic‚Äîreproducing vegetatively and never attaching to the seafloor during their lifecycles. The Atlantic Ocean's Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of Sargassum. History Sargassum was named by the Portuguese sailors who found it in the Sargasso Sea after the wooly rock rose (Halimium lasianthum) that grew in their water wells at home, and that was called sarga√ßo in Portuguese ().G√≥mez de Silva, Guido 1988. Breve diccionario etimol√≥gico de la lengua espa√±ola. Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica, Mexico City, , p. 627. The Florida Keys and mainland South Florida are well known for their high levels of Sargassum covering their shores. Gulfweed was observed by Columbus. Although it was formerly thought to cover the entirety of the Sargasso Sea, making navigation impossible, it has since been found to occur only in drifts. Sargassum species are also cultivated and cleaned for use as an herbal remedy. Many Chinese herbalists prescribe powdered Sargassum‚Äîeither the species S. pallidum, or more rarely, hijiki, S. fusiforme‚Äîin doses of 0.5 gram dissolved in warm water and drunk as a tea. It is called in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is used to resolve \\"heat phlegm\\".  Description  Close-up of Sargassum, showing the air bladders that help it stay afloat Species of this genus of algae may grow to a length of several metres. They are generally brown or dark green in color and consist of a holdfast, a stipe, and a frond. Oogonia and antheridia occur in conceptacles embedded in receptacles on special branches. Some species have berrylike gas-filled bladders that help the fronds float to promote photosynthesis. Many have a rough, sticky texture that, along with a robust but flexible body, helps it withstand strong water currents.  Ecology  Large, pelagic mats of Sargassum in the Sargasso Sea act as one of the only habitats available for ecosystem development; this is because the Sargasso Sea lacks any land boundaries.US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2013, June 01). What is the Sargasso Sea? Retrieved November 28, 2017 The Sargassum patches act as a refuge for many species in different parts of their development, but also as a permanent residence for endemic species that can only be found living on and within the Sargassum.Laffoley, D.d‚ÄôA., Roe, H.S.J., Angel, M.V., Ardron, J., Bates, N.R., Boyd, I.L., Brooke, S., Buck, K.N., Carlson, C.A., Causey, B., Conte, M.H., Christiansen, S., Cleary, J., Donnelly, J., Earle, S.A., Edwards, R., Gjerde, K.M., Giovannoni, S.J., Gulick, S., Gollock, M., Hallett, J., Halpin, P., Hanel, R., Hemphill, A., Johnson, R.J., Knap, A.H., Lomas, M.W., McKenna, S.A., Miller, M.J., Miller, P.I., Ming, F.W., Moffitt, R., Nelson, N.B., Parson, L., Peters, A.J., Pitt, J., Rouja, P., Roberts, J., Roberts, J., Seigel, D.A., Siuda, A.N.S., Steinberg, D.K., Stevenson, A., Sumaila, V.R., Swartz, W., Thorrold, S., Trott, T.M., and V.

Sargasso Sea Alliance, 44 pp. These endemic organisms have specialized patterns and colorations that mimic the Sargassum and allow them to be impressively camouflaged in their environment. In total, these Sargassum mats are home to more than 11 phyla and over 100 different species. There is also a total of 81 fish species (36 families represented) that reside in the Sargassum or utilize it for parts of their life cycles. Other marine organisms, such as young sea turtles, will use the Sargassum as shelter and a resource for food until they reach a size at which they can survive elsewhere. This community is being affected by humans due to overfishing, trash and other types of pollution, and boat traffic, which could eventually lead to the demise of this diverse and unique habitat. Below is a list of organisms that are associated with the Sargassum in the Sargasso Sea. The Sargasso Sea plays a major role in the migration of catadromous eel species such as the European eel, the American eel, and the American conger eel. The larvae of these species hatch within the sea and as they grow they travel to Europe or the East Coast of North America. Later in life, the matured eel migrates back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn and lay eggs. It is also believed that after hatching, young Loggerhead sea turtles use currents such as the Gulf Stream to travel to the Sargasso Sea, where they use the sargassum as cover from predators until they are mature.

Sargassum species are found throughout tropical areas of the world and are often the most obvious macrophyte in near-shore areas where Sargassum beds often occur near coral reefs. The plants grow subtidally and attach to coral, rocks, or shells in moderately exposed or sheltered rocky or pebble areas. These tropical populations often undergo seasonal cycles of growth and decay in concert with seasonal changes in sea temperature. In tropical Sargassum species that are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins occurs. Sargassum adrift in Gulf Stream Sargassum Inundation Along Western Atlantic Coastlines Saint Martin. Background In limited amounts, washed ashore sargassum plays an important role in maintaining Atlantic and Caribbean coastal ecosystems. Once ashore, sargassum provides vital nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to coastal ecosystems which border the nutrient-poor waters of the western North Atlantic tropics and subtropics. Additionally, it decreases coastal erosion. However, beginning in 2011, unprecedented quantities of sargassum began inundating coastal areas in record amounts. Coastlines in Brazil, the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the east coast of Florida saw quantities of sargassum wash ashore up to three feet deep. The first major sargassum inundation event occurred in 2011 and had a biomass increase of 200 fold compared to the previous eight years average bloom size. Since 2011 increasingly stronger inundation events have occurred every 2-3 years. During a sargassum inundation event in 2018, one sargassum bloom measured over 1600 square kilometers, more than three times the average size.. Recent inundation events have caused millions of dollars of lost revenue in the tourism industry, especially hurting small Caribbean countries whose economies are highly dependent on seasonal tourism. While the Sargasso Sea is a known source of sargassum blooms, variations in the sargassum types composing these inundation events have led researchers to believe that the Sargasso Sea is not the point of origin of inundating sargassum. Sargassum Natans I and Sargassum Fluitans III are the dominant sargassum species found in the Sargasso Sea. Recent net sampling studies have found Sargassum Natans VIII, a previously rare type, are constituting a dominating percentage of sargassum biodiversity in the Western Atlantic and Sargasso Sea. =Causes and Impact=  Biological Impacts  Unprecedented sargassum inundation events cause a range of biological and ecological impacts in affected regions. The decomposition of large quantities of sargassum along coastlines consume oxygen, creating large oxygen-depleted zones resulting in fish kills. Decomposing sargassum additionally creates hydrogen sulfide gas, which causes a range of health impacts in humans. During the sargassum inundation event in 2018, 11,000 Acute Sargassum Toxicity cases were reported in an 8-month span on just the Caribbean islands of Guadalupe and Martinique.. Massive amounts of floating sargassum present a physical barrier preventing corals and seagrasses from receiving sufficient light, fouling boat propellers, and entangling marine turtles and mammals..> With every sargassum inundation event large amounts of nutrients are being transported from the open ocean to coastal environments, the extent of this greatly increased nutrient transport and its effect on marine and coastal ecosystems are still unknown. Understanding this recent biological hazard's causes and drivers are critical as these inundation events become more commonplace.  Nutrient Factors  The Sargasso Sea, a known source area for sargassum blooms, is classified as an oligotrophic region. With warm, oxygen-poor waters and low nutrient contents, biomass production is limited by what little nutrients are present. Historically, low nutrient levels in the Sargasso Sea have limited sargassum production; however, new influxes of nitrogen and phosphorus are driving factors in increased biomass production Recent studies have found three likely drivers of nutrient influx linked to increasing sargassum biomass: an increase in nutrient output from the Amazon River, increased nutrients in the Gulf of Mexico, and coastal upwelling off the West African Coast which transfers deep nutrient-rich waters to the upper water column where sargassum resides. Nutrient output from the Amazon River has been shown to have a direct, yet delayed, effect on large Sargassum inundation events, with events occurring one to two years following years of high nutrient output. Phosphates and iron transported via the trade winds from North Africa have been reported to have a fertilizing effect on sargassum growth; however, further data is required to understand its role in causing inundating sargassum blooms. Researchers globally agree that continued research is required to quantify the effect of marine chemical changes and other environmental factors in the recent increase in Sargassum biomass and inundation events.  Currents and Winds  The physical drivers behind sargassum inundation events are prevailing winds and ocean surface currents. The Caribbean is located in a region heavily effected by trade winds. Trade winds are strong, consistent northeasterly winds which blow-dry, dust-filled air from the Sahara across the Atlantic. Trade winds additionally play a critical role in the annual hurricane season in the Western Atlantic. The Caribbean Current and Antilles branch of the Atlantic North Equatorial Current are the major current transporters of sargassum in the region. https://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/caribbean/caribbean.html Researchers have recently begun using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery and ocean current data to track and forecast inundation events with a high level of accuracy.  Human Impact  The effects of deforestation, waste-water runoff, and commercial agriculture fertilizer on facilitating the excess accumulation of nutrients in aquatic, and marine environments have been well studied and shown to be driving factors in eutrophication. Since detrimental sargassum inundation events did not begin until 2011, it is likely that an unknown nutrient threshold was reached and surpassed. Given current agricultural policies and practices, it is unlikely these inundation events will disappear on their own without human intervention.  Climate Change  Variations in sea level, salinity, water temperature, chemical composition, rainfall patterns, and water acidity all play roles in regulating algae blooms. As anthropogenic forces increase the variability of these factors the frequency, duration, severity, and geographic range of harmful algae blooms has increased causing millions of dollars of lost revenue as well as damaging fragile coastal and coral ecosystems.

Life and playing career Known affectionately as Supersub (because he was a talented goalscorer who, in comparison with other players, rarely started matches for Liverpool - but frequently came into the match as a substitute to make an impact), Fairclough was born in inner city Liverpool and as a child moved to the new Cantril Farm housing estate in the 1960s due to slum clearances. He rose through the Liverpool ranks as a teenager and made his debut for the club on 1 November 1975 in the 1‚Äì0 league win over Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park. As the season progressed, Fairclough scored seven crucial goals in just 14 appearances to land Liverpool the League championship. Nine of these appearances were as substitute. His first goal for the club came three days after his debut on 4 November 1975, during the 6‚Äì0 defeat of Spanish side Real Sociedad at Anfield in a UEFA Cup 2nd round 2nd leg tie. The pecking order of strikers at the club saw Fairclough trailing behind the 'dream duo' of Kevin Keegan and John Toshack, as well as England centre forward David Johnson. In the 1976-77 season, Fairclough made more appearances as a substitute, because of a succession of injuries to Toshack. His most famous Liverpool goal came at Anfield as a substitute in a crucial European Cup quarter final against the French side St Etienne. Liverpool had been a goal adrift from the first leg in France, and when they went 2‚Äì1 up in the home return, the aggregate score was level at 2‚Äì2 but St Etienne led on the away goals rule. Liverpool's manager Bob Paisley sent Fairclough on in the last 20 minutes of the game and with six minutes remaining, Fairclough ran on to a long ball upfield and held off two St Etienne defenders to score the tie's decisive goal at the Kop end. ITV commentator Gerald Sinstadt famously bellowed: \\"Supersub strikes again!\\" Liverpool won the League title again and reached both the FA Cup final at Wembley and the European Cup final in Rome. Fairclough was not selected for the Wembley squad as Paisley named veteran winger Ian Callaghan as the substitute, and Liverpool lost to Manchester United. However, he was a substitute in Rome as Liverpool won 3‚Äì1. The following season, Fairclough scored a goal in each leg as Liverpool thrashed Keegan's Hamburg 7‚Äì1 on aggregate in the European Super Cup. Liverpool reached the European Cup final again and this time Fairclough started the match. A 1‚Äì0 victory over Bruges retained the trophy for Liverpool. He managed 29 league appearances that season, scoring 10 goals, but the Reds were beaten to both the league title and the Football League Cup by newly promoted Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough. In 1978‚Äì79, Liverpool regained their league championship crown but Fairclough did not play enough games to seal another title medal, as he had played just four times in the league, scoring twice. Fairclough scored his only Liverpool hat-trick on 9 February 1980 in the thrilling 5‚Äì3 league victory over Norwich City at Carrow Road. His goals came in the 4th, 18th and 75th minutes, with Kenny Dalglish and Jimmy Case scoring to guarantee a late win for the Reds. However, Fairclough's league chances were again restricted that season, as he played just 14 league games and scored five goals. He came on as a substitute in the League Cup semi final second leg against Nottingham Forest four days after his hat trick at Norwich, and scored a late equaliser to preserve Liverpool's long two-year unbeaten run at Anfield. Even though Liverpool went out on aggregate to Forest, Fairclough's goal helped create an English record of eighty five unbeaten matches in succession at home. Fairclough spent another five years at Anfield, although in what was a golden era for the club, he was rarely in the first team. He was a prolific scorer in the reserves, but the phenomenal partnership of Dalglish and Ian Rush rendered him surplus to first team requirements. In the 1982‚Äì83 season he scored three times in eight league appearances but failed to play enough games to merit a title medal. He had also failed to make the squad for the League Cup victories of the previous two seasons, and in the 1981‚Äì82 season, when the Reds won another league title as well as the League Cup, he did not play a single first team game. The Supersub tag belied the number of first team starts Fairclough made at Liverpool; of his 153 appearances, only 61 were from the bench. He scored 55 goals (34 of them in the league), averaging a goal every 2.8 games. Fairclough left Liverpool on 4 July 1983 after a loan spell at NASL side Toronto Blizzard. He then moved to the Swiss side FC Lucerne before returning to England for spells with Manchester City, Norwich, Oldham Athletic and Rochdale. He moved overseas once more to Belgium club Beveren for three seasons before returning home for stints with Tranmere Rovers and Wigan Athletic. He ended his playing days at non-league Knowsley. Later life and legacy Fairclough now works as a pundit and also on the after-dinner circuit, he also writes a weekly column on the official Liverpool Football Club web-site. Fairclough is still a firm favourite amongst the Anfield faithful and was voted in at No.18 on the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop. The poll was conducted by the Reds official web-site, 110,000 supporters worldwide took part listing their favourite 10 Liverpool players of all-time. Fairclough's 18th place was higher than John Toshack's 34th and David Johnson's 77th positions, two of the players that prevented Fairclough from gaining more Liverpool appearances. Fairclough was married to Jan Fairclough who died on 9 April 2011. Jan collapsed suddenly on the morning of 6 April of a brain haemorrhage and died 3 days later. A minute of silence was held for Jan (as well as the 96 Hillsborough victims and Mark Burgan, a soldier from Liverpool) at Anfield before a Liverpool vs. Manchester City match on 11 April 2011. Fairclough and Jan have two children, Tom and Sophie. Fairclough suffered a minor heart attack on 3 October 2010, at the age of 53, but made a full recovery.

Patterson was one of the first women to head a major daily newspaper, the Washington Times-Herald in Washington, D.C. Early life Elinor Josephine Patterson was born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 7, 1881, to the daughter of Robert and Elinor \\"Nellie\\" ( Medill) Patterson. She would change the spelling of her first name to \\"Eleanor\\" as an adult, but would always be known as \\"Cissy,\\" the name her brother gave her in childhood. Her grandfather, Joseph Medill, was Mayor of Chicago and owned the Chicago Tribune, which later passed into the hands of her first cousin Colonel Robert R. McCormick, Joseph Medill's grandson. Her older brother, Joseph Medill Patterson, was the founder of the New York Daily News. Education and marriage She was educated at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. When her uncle Robert S. McCormick was named ambassador to Austria-Hungary, she accompanied him and his wife, Cissy's maternal aunt Kate, to Vienna. There she met Count Josef Gizycki and fell in love with him, a romance not interrupted even by her return to America, where she lived in Washington, D.C.. In Washington, she was a leading light in society, where the press labeled Alice Roosevelt (daughter of Theodore), Marguerite Cassini (daughter of the Russian ambassador), and Cissy the \\"Three Graces.\\" Count Gizycki came to America and they were married in Washington on April 14, 1904 despite her family's objections. A daughter was born to them September 3, 1905, and was named Felicia Leonora (1905‚Äì1999). Cissy went with the Count to his home, a huge feudal manor in Russian Poland. Their family life did not go well. They separated and then rejoined several times, but eventually Cissy set herself on leaving. She took their child, hiding her in a house near London, but the Count pursued her and kidnapped the little Countess, hiding her in an Austrian convent. Cissy filed for divorce, which took thirteen years to obtain. Business dealings and social life After her experience abroad, she moved to Lake Forest, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, but she returned to Washington in 1913. In 1920, her brother Joseph finally succumbed to his sister's entreaties and allowed her to write for his New York Daily News, founded the previous year. She also worked for William Randolph Hearst. She published two novels, romans √† clef, Glass Houses (1926) and Fall Flight (1928), part of her feud with former friend Alice Roosevelt Longworth. In 1925, Eleanor married Elmer Schlesinger, a New York lawyer. He died four years later and in 1930, Mrs. Schlesinger legally changed her name to Mrs. Eleanor Medill Patterson. Patterson tried to buy Hearst's two Washington papers, the morning Washington Herald and the evening Washington Times. However, Hearst hated to sell anything, even when he needed the money. Although he had never made money from his Washington papers, he refused to give up the prestige of owning papers in the capital. However, at the urging of his editor Arthur Brisbane, Hearst agreed to make Patterson the papers' editor. She began work on August 1, 1930. Patterson was a hands-on editor who insisted on the best of everything‚Äîwriting, layout, typography, images, and comics. She encouraged society reporting and the women's page and hired many women as reporters including Adela Rogers St. Johns and Martha Blair. In 1936, she was invited to join the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Patterson shifted the papers' editorial stance sharply to the right. In April 1931, Patterson purchased Mount Airy, a mansion built by Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, in the 1600s. Located on extensive grounds near Rosaryville, Maryland, since about 1910 the mansion's owners had operated it as Dower House, an exclusive restaurant, but it suffered a severe fire in February 1931. Patterson not only meticulously restored the mansion, but improved the stables, added a guest house, and built a greenhouse for growing orchids. In 1937, Hearst's finances had gotten worse and he agreed to lease the Herald and the Times to Patterson with an option to buy. Eugene Meyer, the man who had outbid Hearst and Patterson for The Washington Post in 1933, tried to buy the Herald out from under Patterson, but failed. Instead, she bought both papers from Hearst on January 28, 1939, and merged them as the Times-Herald. Along with her brother at the New York Daily News and her cousin at the Chicago Tribune, Patterson was an unyielding conservative. She was an ardent isolationist and opponent of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1942, after the Battle of Midway, the Times-Herald ran a Tribune story that revealed American intelligence was reading the Japanese naval code. Roosevelt, furious, had the Tribune and the Times-Herald indicted for espionage but backed down because of the publicity, charges he was persecuting his enemies, and the likelihood of an acquittal (since the Navy's own censors had twice cleared the story before it was published). During World War II, she and her brother were accused of being Nazi sympathizers. Representative Elmer Holland of Pennsylvania said on the floor of the United States House of Representatives that the Pattersons \\"would welcome the victory of Hitler.\\" Family difficulties She feuded with her daughter, who publicly \\"divorced\\" her in 1945, and with her former son-in- law, Drew Pearson, by whom she had a granddaughter, Ellen Cameron Pearson Arnold (1926‚Äì2010). An alcoholic for most of her adult life, she died of a heart attack at age 66 at Mount Airy. She left the paper to seven of her editors who within the year sold the paper to her cousin Colonel McCormick. He held onto the paper for five years, and although for several years he seemed close to returning it to profitability, it eventually proved too great a financial drain. After quietly sounding out several other publishers, McCormick opted to sell the paper to the rival Post, which promptly closed it. As Countess Gizycki, Patterson was a frequent visitor to her ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in the 1920s where Donald Hough records an unexpected aspect of her personality: the ability to speak effectively to horses in language worthy of a native cowboy. The Flat Creek Ranch is now on the National Register of Historic Places.

In November 1975, he led a mutiny on the Soviet warship Storozhevoy (, , meaning \\"Vigilant\\") in the hope of starting a Leninist political revolution in the Soviet Union. His mutiny failed and he was executed for treason nine months later. Early life Sablin was born in 1939, the son of a Navy officer. He graduated from the Frunze Naval Institute in Leningrad in 1960 and served in the Soviet Northern Fleet. He was never afraid to openly express his opinions. In 1962, when he was 23, he wrote a letter to Nikita Khrushchev with a request to ‚Äúrid the Communist Party of sycophants and corrupt elements.‚Äù Sablin was lucky and he was just reprimanded. In 1973, he graduated from the Lenin Military-Political Academy and was appointed a political officer. Officer Nikolay Cherkashin, one of Sablin's colleagues, recalled: > He had always thought globally‚Ä¶ He tried to deeply understand social > phenomena. He was a natural politician. The mutiny On 8 November 1975, Captain 3rd Rank Valery Sablin seized the Storozhevoy, a Soviet Burevestnik Class missile frigate, and confined the ship's captain and other officers to the wardroom. Sablin's plan was to take the ship from the Gulf of Riga north into the Gulf of Finland and to Leningrad, through the Neva River, mooring by the decommissioned cruiser Aurora (a symbol of the Russian Revolution), where he would protest by radio and television against the rampant corruption of the Brezhnev era. He planned to say what many were saying privately: that the revolution and motherland were in danger; that the ruling authorities were up to their necks in corruption, demagoguery, graft, and lies, leading the country into an abyss; that the ideals of Communism had been discarded; and that there was a pressing need to revive Leninist principles of justice. Sablin was a strong believer in Leninist values and considered the Soviet system to have essentially \\"sold out\\". A junior officer escaped from confinement and radioed for assistance. When the Storozhevoy cleared the mouth of the Gulf of Riga, ten bomber and reconnaissance airplanes and thirteen warships were in pursuit, firing a number of warning shots across her bows. Several bombs were dropped in front of and behind the ship, as well as cannon fire. Storozhevoy's steering was damaged and she eventually came to a stop. The pursuing vessels then closed in, and the frigate was boarded by Soviet marine commandos. By then, however, Sablin had been shot in his knee and detained by his own crew, who had also unlocked the captain and the other captive officers. Sablin was charged with treason, court-martialled in June 1976 and found guilty. Although this crime usually carried a 15-year prison sentence, Sablin was executed on 3 August 1976. His second-in-command during the mutiny, Alexander Shein, received an eight-year prison sentence. The other mutineers were freed. In 1994, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation reviewed the sentences with a possibility of posthumous rehabilitation. The court partially rehabilitated Sablin rather than fully exonerating him and Shein (who had by that time served his sentence). Reports of the mutiny in the West The Kremlin did not want news of the uprising to spread and was therefore willing, perhaps even prepared, to present it to world public opinion as an attempted defection to the West ‚Äì contrary to Sablin's intentions. The Gulf of Riga can be left northward only through a narrow passage between the Estonian islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa and the mainland. A ship making for Leningrad from Riga that wishes to avoid such confined conditions must initially head west toward the Swedish island of Gotland. Sablin steered this course, which could give the mistaken impression that the Storozhevoy was heading to Sweden or even NATO-member Denmark instead of Leningrad. Until the end of the Cold War, Western intelligence believed that the crew had planned to defect. Gregory D. Young was the first Westerner to investigate the mutiny as part of his 1982 Masters thesis Mutiny on Storozhevoy: A Case Study of Dissent in the Soviet Navy, and later in the book The Last Sentry by Young and Nate Braden. The thesis was placed in the United States Naval Academy archives where it was read by Tom Clancy, then an insurance salesman, who used it as inspiration to write The Hunt for Red October.

There are currently 10 volumes in circulation, published in English in North America by Tokyopop from May 21, 2002 to April 6, 2004. The series is mainly based on Norse mythology but is influenced by various other cultures. It falls into the genres of fantasy, action and adventure. This manhwa became the basis of the widely popular Korean MMORPG, Ragnarok Online developed by Gravity Corp, which in turn was the basis for an adaptation into the anime, Ragnarok the Animation. Currently, Ragnarok is on indefinite hiatus as Lee Myung-jin is helping with the development of Ragnarok Online. Story Ragnarok follows the life and adventures of the warrior Chaos, who is an amnesiac that cannot remember anything from before the last two years in his life. He resides in the city of Fayon, inhabited by a long lineage of warriors. The newest leader in line to claim the head position of the village is a young woman by the name of Iris Irine, who trains with Chaos, her close friend, to become a suitable leader for her people. Meanwhile, Fenris Fenrir searches for Balder's reincarnation to bring about Ragnarok. Characters =Protagonists= * Chaos: A Rune Knight who has lost the memory of his childhood. Chaos came to live in Fayon, a village of great warriors, and became best friends with Iris Irine, the heir to leadership of the village. When Fenris Fenrir arrived in Fayon, Chaos learned that he was the reincarnation of Balder, the God of Light. With his memories starting to return and his powers growing with every battle, Chaos struggles to unravel his past and find his true destiny. Chaos appears to be a newer name than his original in this lifetime. In a flashback, he wears the name tag of \\"Vermillion,\\" from a dragon knight who found him in a bloody area with slain soldiers and a young girl in his arms. Despite his troubled past, he is a relatively good-natured young man who is somewhat clueless about romantic relationships, particularly with Iris Irine. He also is a very loyal friend, including to the very reticent Loki. *Fenris Fenrir: The reincarnation of the Wolf God, Fenris has become a powerful warlock upon returning to life began searching the world for Balder, who had also been reborn as a mortal. Fenris wields many forgotten sorceries, as well as the magical demon-slaying staff Laevatein. Notably, she has the curious ability to copy any spell that strikes her. During her journey, she has come to care deeply for Chaos as well as her memory of Balder, and sees Iris Irine as both a friend and a rival for Chaos's affections. She is a dignified and intelligent woman, seen as a big sister by Iris Irine and as an enigma by Chaos. *Iris Irine: The heir to leadership of Fayon, village of warriors. Iris is a cleric in training and knows many healing spells. She uses Rune Cards (papers that are concealed with magic) inscribed with magical runes to debilitate the enemy and help her allies. Iris has been best friends with Chaos for years and cares about him a great deal (She even calls herself as Chaos' girlfriend sometimes). Though she considers herself dignified and ladylike, she's prone to throwing tantrums and acting childish when she's excited. She admires Fenris greatly and has a running rivalry with the thief Lidia. Currently, her greatest enemy is her half-sister the valkyrie Sara Irine. She wields the magic-destroying sword Chonryongdo, one of three legendary dragon blades. In the English version, there are multiple variations of the spelling of \\"Chonryongdo\\" (e.g., Chernryongdo) though none reflect the actual Korean spelling, Hepburn Romanisation suggesting instead Cheongryongdo. *Loki: The most powerful member of the Assassins' Guild, Loki had never even been wounded twice in combat before encountering Chaos. When the Assassins Guild was almost totally destroyed by Skurai (who had framed the act on Chaos), Loki hunted Chaos down and attacked him. Chaos eventually managed to convince Loki that they were not enemies, and Loki has joined forces with Chaos to hunt down the true culprit. Loki is apparently totally devoid of emotions (though there is some debate on this topic) and has a hard time fathoming them in others. He wields \\"The Might\\" (\\"Cosmic Energy\\" in the English release), the most powerful form of magic in the world, and has been described as \\"the one who is human and not.\\" *Lidia: A thief who travels with a two-tailed cat named Ses. Lidia fancies herself a treasure hunter like her father, and is searching the world over for magical artifacts. Her greatest wish is to find Alfheim, the hidden city of the elves, the one treasure (The treasure of Avariel in the original release) her father could never locate. Lidia started hanging out with Chaos and the gang in order to steal Iris's dagger, Chonryongdo, and later latches on to Loki. She is known as Lidia in the English release. *Reina (Name not stated in the original release): An elfish archer that Chaos and his friends have run into during their time in the city of Geffen. She appears to be the last of her kind and wishes to protect the secret of Alfhiem, the ancient city of the elves. She doesn‚Äôt like Lidia as she is trying to steal the treasures of Alfhiem but she puts aside her differences with her and Loki during their adventure in Alfhiem while battling a powerful assassin (Juliana Lucille) and wizard (The city Mayor). Since the manhwa has been halted it is unsure what will become of her after her, Lidia, and Loki‚Äôs adventure. =Other characters= *The Beholders: Huginn and Muninn, two mysterious individuals who are able to transform into crows. They are the eyes of Odin, Allfather of the Gods, and are acting to influence events in Midgard. They are the ones who directed Skurai to attack first the village of Fayon, and then the Assassins Guild. They also acted to save both Skurai and Sara Irine from the dragon Nidhogg that Chaos summoned during the battle (by accident, but mostly sure, due to his flashbacks). Their true motives are a mystery. However, Muninn seems to have a more sadistic side than the silent Huginn, who displays occasional compassion, such as when he kills a monster about to devour a child. *The Asgard Rangers: A wild band of strangely dressed women who consider themselves to be the champions of truth and justice. However, they seem to simply attack targets at random, then declare their victims to be 'unrighteous,' justifying their own extreme actions. Their wild poses and wacky antics serve to hide their considerable fighting skills. They seem to be a parody of sentai groups like Sailor Moon and Power Rangers. *Doyen and Peony Irine: The father and mother of Iris. They both die at the hands of Skurai and Sara Irine. Lady Irine seems to be the brains behind the operation but the Lord is not dumb, just easily blinded by love of his daughter. Lord Irine is also father to Sara, by another mother, who he later kills for unrevealed reasons. Lord Irine's dying request is for Iris not to hate her sister. Lady Irine is implied to have been killed by Skurai in an attempt to protect the children (Nuri and Seri). *Matthew and the Guards: The accomplished guards of Fayon are led by the massive, if not lovable, Matthew. His hair resembles a rooster's crest, leading Chaos to call him 'chicken head'. He has a blatant infatuation with Iris but never lets it get in the way of duty. The main weapon of the guards is a wall of lethal cannons. These valiant souls go down defending their home. Matthew is made into a zombie by Himmelmez in order to make a foe Chaos would not willingly fight. *Ses (Sessy) the Cat o' Two Tails: This cat can talk, though Lidia would prefer it couldn't. He (A 'She' in the English release) seems to be more reasonable and rational then her owner. According to the Official Player's Handbook found at the start of each volume after the first, she provides a 50% bonus on Pickpocketing Saves. While this is relatively illogical both in wording and use, Ses does seem to do all the work in most of Lidia's criminal escapades. *The Assassins Guild: This group of Arabic inspired warriors are dedicated to preserving the balance of power within the entire continent. This means favoring good OR evil as the balance shifts. The policy doesn't exactly make them friends with anyone. Most are slaughtered by Skurai. Taulin and a small band of others survive because they accompany Loki to battle Surt's minions. The survivors are eventually stationed at the Guild headquarters to rebuild and recover the heavy losses taken. *General Karl Johann Spiegal: Commander of the forces of Volsug, he is a competent and good natured man. He is forced to imprison Chaos and his companions but assures them that he trusts them and would support them as a witness. When the forces of Himmelmez attack the city, he takes Fenris and Iris to the fragment of the Heart of Ymir. He becomes critically wounded but is stabilized in time. *The White and Black Mages: These taciturn characters constantly show up in the background of any major crowd. They are mimics of their namesakes from the Final Fantasy RPG series. They appear to be a tribute to that popular series. *Angelina Kidman: This spunky young woman is the announcer for the Geffen magic tourney and the prime secretary (As said in the original release) of the Witch Guild. She has a lecherous co-host, Frontain Rod, who is more concerned with the breasts of female competitors. *Frontain Rod Kimacue: He is the co-host announcer of the Geffen magic tourney, by Angelina's side, and the account manager of the Gravity Research Union (As said in the original release). He is a rather perverted person, who keeps peeking on women's breasts with his binoculars. Although he seems to be only an old perverted man, he has a lot of knowledge about magic and fighting techniques. He recognizes every single move that Fenris uses and is being curious about who Fenris really is. Just like he stated in the original release; \\"I have no idea, that how I should be reacting to Fenris's techniques. She's a complete mystery, and I'd really like to know who she really is and where does she come from\\". *Gustav Kube the Magician: A novice magician who explains the city of Geffen to our heroes. His character model would later be used as the basis for Mage in Ragnarok Online. Additional information This series is supposed to go on for 40+ books, but Lee Myoung-Jin has put it aside to work on artwork for Ragnarok Online instead.

The band initially rehearsed at Slider's parents' pig farm, where Jonathan King sometimes came to watch them, considering the option of becoming the act's promoter.Ogg, p. 508Strong, p. 140-1 Before securing a record contract the lineup changed, with Harris and Bostock being replaced by Dave Parsons and Mark Cain. Slider left shortly afterwards and was replaced by Dave Tregunna on the bass guitar. Sham 69 went on to release four long-players via Polydor Records, and had six UK top 50 singles before it broke up in 1980, with the violence that regularly marred its gigs having taken a toll on the band. Pursey set up a short-lived new band with Steve Jones and Paul Cook, formerly of The Sex Pistols, titled the \\"Sham Pistols\\", before embarking on a solo career. He also worked around this period as a record producer on the early releases by Cockney Rejects, and the Angelic Upstarts. His first solo material was released via Polydor Records, being the single Lucky Man (1980), and a long-player entitled Imagination Camouflage (1980), recorded with Derwood Andrews and Mark Laff, formerly of Generation X as session musicians, who also received co-writing credits for two of the LP's songs).Entry for 'Imagination Camouflage' in the 'Discogs' website (2019).

In July 2011 Pursey reformed Sham 69 again with the band's late 1970s members. At a meeting held between Pursey and Dave Parsons, original Sham 69 guitarist and co-writer of nearly all of the Sham repertoire with Pursey, the two ironed out their differences. Dave Tregunna, on bass, and Mark Cain, on drums, were called in to complete the original lineup for a show in London. Personal life Pursey lives in the Surrey town of Chertsey. He is a part-time artist, and has been known to sell paintings to raise funding for the Hersham Hounds Greyhound Sanctuary. In May 2005 there was a disturbance at The Head art gallery in Brighton, when Pursey interrupted an art show opening drinks party and removed a number of his paintings from the display after a disagreement with the curator over them. In August 2005 Pursey was involved in a physical confrontation with John Lydon whilst they were both queuing for travel visas at the United States Embassy in London, Lydon reportedly having spurned an offer of Pursey's hand with verbal abuse and a drink being thrown, with Pursey responding by kicking at Lydon in retaliation.

It is the only American \\"cemetery of national memory\\" founded before the Civil War.National Historic Landmark Nomination, p. 4 Over 65,000 individuals are buried or memorialized at the cemetery, including many who helped form the nation and the city of Washington in the early 19th century. Although the Episcopal Christ Church, Washington Parish owns the cemetery, the U.S. government has purchased 806 burial plots, which are administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congress, located about a mile and a half (2.4 km) to the northwest, has greatly influenced the history of the cemetery.Department of Veterans Affairs, Congressional Cemetery Government Lots, accessed April 27, 2012. The cemetery still sells plots, and is an active burial ground. From the Washington Metro, the cemetery lies three blocks east of the Potomac Avenue station and two blocks south of the Stadium-Armory station. Many members of the U.S. Congress who died while Congress was in session are interred at Congressional Cemetery. Other burials include early landowners and speculators, the builders and architects of early Washington, Native American diplomats, Washington city mayors, and American Civil War veterans. Nineteenth-century Washington, D.C., families unaffiliated with the federal government also have graves and tombs at the cemetery. In all, there are one Vice President, one Supreme Court justice, six Cabinet members, 19 Senators and 71 Representatives (including a former Speaker of the House) buried there, as well as veterans of every American war, and the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1969, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2011. History =Founding= The Congressional Cemetery was established by private citizens associated with Christ Church on a 4.5 acre plot in 1807 and was later given to Christ Church, which gave it its official name Washington Parish Burial Ground. By 1817 sites were set aside for government legislators and officials; this includes cenotaphs for many legislators buried elsewhere. The cenotaphs, designed by Benjamin Latrobe, each have a large square block with recessed panels set on a wider plinth and surmounted by a conical point. George Clinton's monument by Benjamin Latrobe, 1812. Clinton was later reinterred in New York. The monuments to the right are in the form of the Latrobe cenotaphs. From 1823 to 1876 the U.S. Congress funded the expansion, enhancement, and maintenance of the cemetery, but it never became a federal institution. Appropriations funded a gravel road from the Capitol to the cemetery, paving within the cemetery, the public vault, fencing, and the gatehouse, as well as funerals for congressmen and the cenotaphs. During the early part of this period, graves were laid out in a grid pattern in an extension of the grid in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, and little or no landscaping or plantings were made on the grounds.National Historic Landmark Nomination, p. 8. The grid survives to this day and was extended as the cemetery expanded. =Expansion= Starting in the late 1840s, the cemetery was influenced by the rural cemetery movement in which the graves were placed in a park-like setting with extensive landscaping. To implement this new vision, the cemetery needed to expand. Between 1849 and 1869 the cemetery grew in area to 35.75 acres. The original cemetery was located on block 1115 on E Street between 18th and 19th Streets Southeast in 1808. In 1849, it doubled in size by acquiring the block to its south, 1116. In 1853, it expanded to the east on blocks 1130, 1148 and 1149 between F and G Streets Southeast. In 1853‚Äì53, the cemetery expanded to the west by acquiring block 1104, between 17th Street and 18th Streets Southeast. In 1858, the cemetery acquired block 1105 and Reservation 13. In 1859, it added blocks 1105 and 1123. Finally, the cemetery reached its current extent of 35.75 acres by growing south to Water Street Southeast with blocks 1106 and 1117 in 1869. Grave of John Philip Sousa Eventually the land to the south of the cemetery was transferred to the National Park Service although the access road to the RFK Stadium parking lot is administered by the DC Sports and Entertainment Commission. In the 1950s, it appeared that the southeast corner of the cemetery would become a part of the right of way for the Southeast-Southwest Freeway. However, protracted environmental litigation halted construction at Pennsylvania Avenue, with the dead end of the freeway being connected by a temporary road to the RFK parking lot and to 17th Street Southeast at the southwest corner of the cemetery. =Decline and revival= After 1876 the cemetery was seldom used or supported by Congress. Nevertheless, many wealthy Washingtonians continued to bury family members there, and figures associated with the government who were local residents, such as Marine Corps Band Director John Philip Sousa and J. Edgar Hoover, were buried there. By the 1970s urban decay, the declining membership of Christ Church, and the declining value of the endowment funded by Christ Church, left the cemetery in serious difficulties. Monuments and burial vaults were in disrepair. Maintenance on buildings had been long delayed. There was no paid staff and minimal funding. Drug dealers and prostitutes began to occupy the cemetery.Betsy Crosby, The Resurrection of Congressional Cemetery, Historic Capitol Cemetery Revived by Local Preservationists, Preservation, January/February, 2012. The cemetery is still owned by Christ Church but since 1976 it has been managed by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC). Progress on the renovation was very slow until two volunteers became involved. Jim Oliver, then assistant manager of the House Republican Cloakroom, became involved in the late 1980s and helped revive congressional interest in the cemetery. The K-9 Corps, a group of dog owners whose activities helped drive away the drug dealers, was organized in 1997. Renovation picked up after C-SPAN broadcast a video on the cemetery on July 5, 1996. The following weekend 100 airmen from Andrews Air Force Base arrived unannounced to mow the 35-acre lawn, and a contingent from the Army post at Fort Belvoir followed the next month. A Joint Service Day involving all five branches of the U.S. military has since become an annual tradition. In 2013, a record 328 people participated. The National Trust for Historic Preservation included the cemetery on its 1997 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places and many gifts and donations were soon received. Congress gave $1 million in matching funds in 1999 to create an endowment for basic maintenance, and a 2002 Congressional appropriation funds restoration. The APHCC now hosts over 1,000 volunteers each year working on a wide variety of projects: from planting bulbs to resetting tombstones to pruning trees, adopting and landscaping individual plots, providing research, and writing a quarterly newsletter. Events hosted by the APHCC have included free guided tours on Saturdays, Christmas caroling, Christ Church's Easter services, book signings, Pride 5k race and Dead Man's Run 5k race, Day of the Dog Festival, Ghosts & Goblets Gala, and much more. In August 2013 the cemetery began using goats to eat and clear the surrounding wooded area of poison ivy, English ivy, grass, and other plants. The 58 \\"eco-goats\\", which cost $4,000, are considered more ecologically friendly than mowers and pesticides and provide fertilizer as well. It was the first use of goats inside the beltway. The use of the goats drew widespread international attention and televised reports on BBC World News, Nat Geo, News Hour, NBC Nightly News, Tokyo TV, China CCTV, and Al-Jazeera.Shapira, Ian. \\"At Congressional Cemetery, Goats Eating Their Way Through an Acre of Poison Ivy.\\" Washington Post.

In the May 2013, Congressional Cemetery hired Topographix, a firm which surveys cemeteries using ground-penetrating radar, to document burials in the cemetery. Although the cemetery had excellent records going back to its founding, many burial sites lacked a marker or had the marker removed or stolen. Additionally, subsidence of some areas and buckling in others changed the location of graves.Bosworth, Sharon. \\"Congressional Cemetery Revealed.\\" Capital Community News. June 1, 2013. Accessed 2013-12-25. The last time Congressional Cemetery was accurately and completely mapped was 1935. By the end of 2013, about half the cemetery had been mapped, revealing a potential 2,750 unmarked burial sites. Cemetery staff said many of these burials are probably recorded, but some may be new discoveries. Congressional Cemetery officials said they were one of only 12 cemeteries in the city still accepting burials, and the mapping project would allow it to identify unused space. The mapping project will be completed in the spring of 2014, and the cemetery said it would use the results to release a mobile phone app which will allow users to search for and locate graves on their own.Binkovitz, Leah. \\"'Bone Finder' Plots Unmarked Graves at Historic Congressional Cemetery.\\" Washington Post. December 25, 2013. Accessed 2013-12-25. Monuments and structures Cenotaphs of Senators John C. Calhoun (left) and Henry Clay The Congressional Cemetery is a National Historic Landmark Historic District with 9 contributing structures and 186 contributing objects built from 1817 to 1876. Later structures and objects are considered to be \\"non-contributing\\" even if they are significant in the cemetery's current appearance.NHL Nomination, p. 9. =Cenotaphs= Of the 186 contributing objects, 168 are the nearly identical Congressional cenotaphs, believed to have been designed by the Architect of the Capitol Benjamin Latrobe. As used at the Congressional Cemetery, the term \\"cenotaph\\" includes not only monuments to those buried elsewhere, but also to the Latrobe monuments that mark the actual graves of representatives and senators. Some congressmen are buried under a cenotaph, some are buried without one in a different area of the cemetery, and for some the marker is a true cenotaph. James Gillespie (1747‚Äì1805) who was reinterred in 1892, has a separate grave and cenotaph. A cenotaph was erected for each congressman who died in office from 1833 to 1876. The first was for Rep. James Lent. After Congress appropriated funds and his monument was ordered, his family reinterred the body in New York. Congress erected the monument in 1839 anyway, establishing the tradition of erecting cenotaphs. Cenotaphs of Tip O'Neill (front, with flag) and Hale Boggs (rear, with flag). Note QRpedia QR codes displayed on metal spikes. The cenotaphs are constructed of Aquia sandstone, as are the White House and the Capitol, and were likewise painted white, forming a visual connections with these nearby symbols of federal government, and a contrast to the surrounding gravestones. They are grouped in rows in the older part of the cemetery where they dominate the landscape. After the Civil War very few congressmen were buried in the cemetery, as their bodies were commonly shipped to their home states or buried in the new National Cemeteries such as Arlington National Cemetery. Cenotaphs were discontinued in 1876 after Massachusetts Senator George Frisbie Hoar stated that \\"the thought of being buried beneath one of those atrocities brought new terror to death.\\"Congressional Cemetery, 2007, Cenotaph Walking Tour, accessed April 3, 2012. William Thornton, who served as Architect of the Capitol before Latrobe, is the only person honored with a cenotaph who did not serve as a congressman. Former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill was honored with a cenotaph in 1994, though it is not in the style of a Latrobe cenotaph. After a 1972 plane crash in which their bodies were lost, Hale Boggs and Nicholas Begich share a cenotaph. These are the only cenotaphs erected since 1876. The Public Vault =Public Vault= Arsenal Disaster Monument The Public Vault is an early classical revival structure built 1832‚Äì34 with federal funds to store the bodies of government officials before burial. A classical marble facade with baroque scrolls decorate the partially subterranean vault. Double wrought iron doors have the words \\"PUBLIC VAULT\\" displayed by means of vent holes. Temporary residents of this vault have included three U.S. presidents: John Quincy Adams (1848), William Henry Harrison (1841), and Zachary Taylor (1850). President Harrison stayed in the vault for three months, three times longer than the time he spent as president.Josh Swiller, A Walk Through Congressional Cemetery, Washingtonian, May 19, 2011. First Lady Dolley Madison was interred in the Public Vault for two years, the longest known interment in the vault, while funds were being raised for her re-interment at Montpelier. Her body was transferred to Causten family vault, located directly across the path from the Public Vault, for another six years before the funds were raised.American Artifacts: Congressional Cemetery, American History TV, CSPAN3, on YouTube, accessed April 16, 2012. First Lady Louisa Catherine Adams has been reported as having been interred in the Public Vault, but other sources report that she was interred in the Causten family vault.Johnson and Johnson, p. 139, unequivocally states that Louisa Adams was interred in the Causten family vault the day after her death. Adams is now buried next to her husband in the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts. Legend says that Lewis Powell spent a night in the vault while avoiding pursuit for his role in the assassination of President Lincoln. =Arsenal Disaster Monument= In 1864 an explosion at the nearby Washington Arsenal killed a woman supervisor and 20 teenage girls, most of them Irish, who worked packing explosives and cartridges. President Lincoln led the funeral procession to the cemetery and attended the graveside ceremonies. Later a monument was erected over the graves of 16 of the victims. A sculpture of a grieving young woman stands atop a marble column on the monument.NHL Nomination, pp. 11 and 23. Local artist, Lot Flannery of the Flannery Brothers Marble Manufacturers, sculpted the monument. Grand funerals Several nationally important or otherwise remarkable funerals have taken place at the Congressional Cemetery. These funerals featured long formal processions starting at the White House or the Capitol, moving down Pennsylvania Avenue to E Street SE, and thence to the cemetery. Parts of this road were specially funded by Congress to facilitate these processions. The form and protocol of these funerals formed the basis for later U.S. state funerals, including those of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.Johnson and Johnson, Chapter 2, \\"The Grand Procession to the National Burial Ground.\\" These funerals include those held to honor: *George Clinton, vice president, funeral held April 22, 1812.

The association has five full-time employees, one part-time archivist, and over 500 volunteers. The APHCC named Paul K. Williams President in July 2012. Its mission is: > To serve the community as an active burial ground and conserve the physical > artifacts, buildings, and infrastructure of the cemetery; to celebrate the > American heritage represented by those interred here; to restore and sustain > the landscape, to protect the Anacostia River watershed, and to manage the > grounds as an accessible community resource. Green space at the cemetery In 2009, the association retained the Oehme, van Sweden & Associates to develop a new landscape plan. The cemetery has approximately 2,000 plots available for sale. On March 20, 2014, the cemetery received its green burial certification from the Green Burial Council. Green burials are allowed in any plot in the cemetery. =K-9 Corps= Congressional Cemetery is also known for allowing members of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC) to walk dogs off-leash on the cemetery grounds. In addition to their membership dues, K-9 Corps members pay a fee for the privilege of walking their dogs. K-9 Corps members provide about 20% of Congressional Cemetery's operating income. Dog walkers follow a set of rules and regulations and provide valuable volunteer time to restore the cemetery. The K-9 Corps program is recognized as providing the impetus for the revitalization of Congressional Cemetery, which had fallen into neglect prior to the program's creation. In 2008, the association restricted K-9 membership, placing restrictions on dogwalkers as the program became more popular. The K-9 Corps program has been nationally recognized for creative use of urban green space.http://www.cemeterydogs.org See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in the District of Columbia *Alexander Dallas Bache Monument Notes Sources History of the Congressional Cemetery, U.S. Senate, December 6, 1906 *Congressional Cemetery, Historic American Landscapes Survey, 2005 * External links * with map and index CemeteryDogs.org, K9 Corps website *Cemetery Dog, YouTube video *QR codes at Congressional Cemetery, Channel 7 ABC WJLA in Washington, July 17, 2012 *C-SPAN American History TV Tour of Congressional Cemetery 1807 establishments in the United States Cemeteries in Washington, D.C.

The square has gardens in the centre with lawns and large trees. Location Tredegar Square is 90 metres north of main commercial thoroughfare of the district, Mile End Road. Six roads branch off the square including one sharing its name starting about 120 metres east of Mile End tube station. Architecture In pale brown brick, three unbroken terraces line the square, with long continuous white cornices, sash windows, fanlights, railings in front of basements and bold, traditional single-colour doors. All windows are white framed and a stucco white frame fronts the central houses of one of these three rows. The north is the exception, with similar shaped houses or sets of subdivided houses; these have white, ashlar-faced fronts or genuine large carved stone block facings, black railings on white-painted concrete and heavily porticoed, projecting and recessed features -- for example, pediments above a feature window in the few recesses. The level of complex forms and white stone-like appearance resembles many of the blocks in Belgravia and Bayswater. History The square takes its name from the landowner, Sir Charles Morgan, 2nd Baronet Tredegar, and his family estate Tredegar House near Newport, South Wales. One block north of the square is the The Lord Tredegar public house and one block east The Morgan Arms on Morgan Street. The south and west sides of the square were completed in the 1830s, and the rest by 1847. The industrial town of Tredegar in South Wales also takes its name from the Tredegar estate, following the establishment in the area of The Tredegar Iron Company in 1800, on land owned by the Morgan family. =Coburn School campus named after square= Prisca Coburn (1622-1701), the widow of a Bow brewer, left property in Bow, Stratford, and Bocking (Essex) to maintain a school for not more than 50 poor children at Bow; the boys were to learn reading, writing, and accounts, and the girls reading, writing, and needlework. An expansion plan in 1873, to day- school 200 boys and 200 girls (in adjoining buildings) meant the Bocking estate was sold and part of the proceeds used to purchase and extend a building \\"in Tredegar Square\\", however clearly shown on the map as narrowly beyond its north-west corner, also known as Stepney Grammar School. The school did not prosper on its own in its new surroundings, and by 1884 was in financial difficulties; the girl's school temporarily closed and a merger took place within a decade. In 1898 Coborn School was moved to 29‚Äì31 Bow Road, where it remained until the move to Upminster in 1971, initial plans of which had been well advanced in 1963.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol1/p290a =Restoration after damage in the London Blitz= The Tredegar Square Conservation Area was established in 1971, after the square had become neglected prior to World War II; the area surrounding it was badly damaged by bombing during the war.

In Mahabharata‚ÄîAn ancient story of war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas‚Äîthe blind king Dhritarashtra is the father of the principals of the Kaurava side. Sanjaya, son of charioteer Gavalgana, is Dhritarashtra's advisor and also his charioteer. Sanjaya was a disciple of sage Krishna Dwaipayana Veda Vyasa and was immensely devoted to his master, King Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya ‚Äî who has the gift of seeing events at a distance (divya-drishti) right in front of him, granted by the sage Vyasa ‚Äî narrates to Dhritarashtra the action in the climactic battle of Kurukshetra, which includes the Bhagavad Gita.Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1. Role in the Mahabharata =As a messenger= Dhritarashtra summons Sanjaya to become messenger of the Pandavas, Artist Daud, folio of Razmnama. Before this great war broke out, Sanjaya had gone to Yudhishtira as the Ambassador of Kauravas to negotiate on behalf of them. =Gift of Divine Vision = Vyasa gives the divine vision to Sanjaya for Dhritarashtra. Having a divine vision is completely different than just subtle sight (‚ÄúSanjaya‚Äôs Gift‚Äù). One who possesses subtle sight sees image of things invisible in his mind, whereas in divine vision, instead of it being in the mind, it is like seeing it in person. Also, the sounds are heard with the physical ear and not as a current of thought. =As the describer of the Mahabharata war= While Sanjaya was still in Hastinapur, the series of events that happened in the battlefield of Kurukshetra was very clear to him (‚ÄúSanjaya‚Äôs Gift‚Äù). He saw with his eyes as if he was in the battlefield. Sanjaya saw: partisans of Dhritarashtra and the Pandavas gathered there, heard with his ears the words of Duryodhana, the fierce battle-cry of grandfather Bhishma, the mighty sound of Panchajanya proclaiming the destruction of the Kurus, and the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna bringing out the import of the Gita (‚ÄúSanjaya‚Äôs Gift‚Äù). Sanjaya clearly has an advantage over an average person because he could hear things that would even frighten the average person. He was described to be gifted as he could see ‚Äúevents at a distance granted by the Rishi Vyasa‚Äù (‚ÄúSanjaya, Charioteer‚Äù). On the eve of the Mahabharata War, the Gita was spoken, ‚Äúwe find in the very first verse of the Gita, King Dhritarashtra seeking information about the War from Sanjaya who had received the gift of divine vision‚Äù(‚ÄúSanjaya‚Äôs Gift‚Äù). As Dhritarashtra‚Äôs advisor, Sanjaya‚Äôs job was not as hard. Until he had to tell Dhritarashtra the news of the death of his ‚Äúhundred sons at the hands of Bhima at different points of time in the battle and offers the sorrowing king solace in his darkest hours‚Äù(‚ÄúVyasa‚Äù). Sanjaya tells every incident of the Kurukshetra war. Sanjaya also gives various descriptions of: Earth, the other planets, and focuses on the Indian subcontinent and gives an elaborate list of hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, and forests of the (ancient) Indian Subcontinent (Bharata Varsha). He also explains about the military formations adopted by each side on each day, the death of each hero and the details of each war-racing (‚ÄúVyasa‚Äù). Sanjaya is known to be very frank in his narration of the battle events and his opinions and he also predicted the destruction of Kauravas at the hands of Krishna and Arjuna (‚ÄúSanjaya, Charioteer‚Äù). Sanjaya was Dhritarashtra's honest advisor.  Symbolism  Sanjaya is a virtuous character who ‚Äúrepresents intuitive knowledge, which arises from long and arduous spiritual practice, predominance of sattva and inner awakening‚Äù (V, ‚ÄúSymbolism in the Bhagavadgita‚Äù). Despite him not being as lucky as Arjuna to earn the divine grace, he is still able to receive knowledge from Lord Krishna because he mastered having control over his body and mind (V, ‚ÄúSymbolism in the Bhagavadgita‚Äù). He represents having a sense of awareness as he is able to witness all of the details occurring in the battle. Sanjaya was able to spot when ‚ÄúArjuna dropped his bow and arrows, and sat down on the seat of the chariot, with his mind overwhelmed with sorrow‚Äù (Sharma 11). Seeing Arjuna past his physical appearance as being exhausted from the battle, Sanjaya displays his mastery in the mind and body as he was able to see Arjuna as sorrowful.

Boiling chips are frequently employed in distillation and heating. When a liquid becomes superheated, a speck of dust or a stirring rod can cause violent flash boiling. Boiling chips provide nucleation sites so the liquid boils smoothly without becoming superheated or bumping.  Use  Boiling chips should not be added to liquid that is already near its boiling point, as this could also induce flash boiling. The structure of a boiling chip traps liquid while in use, meaning that they cannot be re-used in laboratory setups. They also don't work well under vacuum; if a solution is boiling under vacuum, it's best to constantly stir it instead.  Materials  Boiling chips are typically made of a porous material, such as alumina, silicon carbide, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, porcelain or carbon, and often have a nonreactive coating of PTFE. This ensures that the boiling chips will provide effective nucleation sites, yet are chemically inert. In less demanding situations, like school laboratories, pieces of broken porcelainware or glassware are often used.

The dye laser is considered to be the first broadly tunable laser. A tunable laser is a laser whose wavelength of operation can be altered in a controlled manner. While all laser gain media allow small shifts in output wavelength, only a few types of lasers allow continuous tuning over a significant wavelength range. There are many types and categories of tunable lasers. They exist in the gas, liquid, and solid state. Among the types of tunable lasers are excimer lasers, gas lasers (such as CO2 and He-Ne lasers), dye lasers (liquid and solid state), transition metal solid-state lasers, semiconductor crystal and diode lasers, and free electron lasers.F. J. Duarte (ed.), Tunable Lasers Handbook (Academic, 1995). Tunable lasers find applications in spectroscopy,W. Demtr√∂der, Laser Spectroscopy: Basic Principles, 4th Ed.

(Academic, New York, 1990) Chapter 9. and optical communications. Types of tunability =Single line tuning= Since no real laser is truly monochromatic, all lasers can emit light over some range of frequencies, known as the linewidth of the laser transition. In most lasers, this linewidth is quite narrow (for example, the nm wavelength transition of a Nd:YAG laser has a linewidth of approximately 120 GHz, or 0.45 nmKoechner, ¬ß2.3.1, p49.). Tuning of the laser output across this range can be achieved by placing wavelength-selective optical elements (such as an etalon) into the laser's optical cavity, to provide selection of a particular longitudinal mode of the cavity. =Multi-line tuning= Most laser gain media have a number of transition wavelengths on which laser operation can be achieved. For example, as well as the principal nm output line, Nd:YAG has weaker transitions at wavelengths of nm, nm, nm, nm, and a number of other lines.Koechner, ¬ß2.3.1, p53. Usually, these lines do not operate unless the gain of the strongest transition is suppressed; e.g., by use of wavelength-selective dielectric mirrors. If a dispersive element, such as a prism, is introduced into the optical cavity, tilting of the cavity's mirrors can cause tuning of the laser as it \\"hops\\" between different laser lines. Such schemes are common in argon-ion lasers, allowing tuning of the laser to a number of lines from the ultraviolet and blue through to green wavelengths. =Narrowband tuning= For some types of lasers the laser's cavity length can be modified, and thus they can be continuously tuned over a significant wavelength range. Distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor lasers and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) use periodic distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) structures to form the mirrors of the optical cavity. If the temperature of the laser is changed, the index change of the DBR structure causes a shift in its peak reflective wavelength and thus the wavelength of the laser. The tuning range of such lasers is typically a few nanometres, up to a maximum of approximately 6 nm, as the laser temperature is changed over ~50 K. As a rule of thumb the wavelength is tuned by 0.08 nm/K for DFB lasers operating in the 1,550 nm wavelength regime. Such lasers are commonly used in optical communications applications such as DWDM-systems to allow adjustment of the signal wavelength. To get wideband tuning using this technique, some such as Santur Corporation or Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT Corporation) contain an array of such lasers on a single chip and concatenate the tuning ranges. =Widely tunable lasers= A typical laser diode. When mounted with external optics these lasers can be tuned mainly in the red and near infrared. Sample Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector lasers (SG-DBR) have a much larger tunable range, by the use of vernier tunable Bragg mirrors and a phase section, a single mode output range of >50 nm can be selected. Other technologies to achieve wide tuning ranges for DWDM-systemsTunable Lasers at Lightreading are: *External cavity lasers using a MEMS structure for tuning the cavity length, such as devices commercialized by Iolon. *External cavity lasers using multiple-prism grating arrangements for wide-range tunability.P. Zorabedian, Tunable external-cavity semiconductor lasers, in Tunable Lasers Handbook, F. J. Duarte, Ed. (Academic, New York, 1995) Chapter 8. *DFB laser arrays based on several thermal tuned DFB lasers: Coarse tuning is achieved by selecting the correct laser bar. Fine tuning is then done thermally, such as devices commercialized by Santur Corporation. *Tunable VCSEL: One of the two mirror stacks is movable. To achieve sufficient output power out of a VCSEL structure, lasers in the nm domain are usually either optically pumped or have an additional optical amplifier built into the device. there is no widely tunable VCSEL commercially available any more for DWDM-system application. It is claimed that the first infrared laser with a tunability of more than one octave was a germanium crystal laser.See photograph 3 at http://spie.org/x39922.xml =Applications= The range of applications of tunable lasers is extremely wide. When coupled to the right filter, a tunable source can be tuned over a few hundreds of nanometersPhotonEtc: Tunable Laser Source from 400nm to 2300nm.Leukos : White light compact supercontinuum systems.Fianium : Powerful WhiteLase Supercontinuum Sources. with a spectral resolution that can go from 4 nm to 0,3 nm, depending on the wavelength range. With a good enough isolation (>OD4) tunable source can be used for basic absorption and photoluminescence study. It can be used for solar cells characterisation in a light beam induced current (LBIC) experiment from which external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a device can be mapped. It can also be used for the characterisation of gold nanoparticles and single-walled carbon nanotube thermopile where a wide tunable range from 400 nm to nm is essential. Tunable sources were recently used for the development of hyperspectral imaging for early detection of retinal diseases where a wide range of wavelength, a small bandwidth and outstanding isolation is crucial in order to achieve an efficient illumination of the entire retina.Tunable Lasers For Retinal Imaging. Tunable source can be a powerful tool for reflection and transmission spectroscopy, photobiology, detector calibration, hyperspectral imaging and steady-state pump probe experiment to name only a few. =History= The first true broadly tunable laser was the dye laser in 1966.F. P. Sch√§fer (ed.), Dye Lasers (Springer, 1990)F. J. Duarte and L. W. Hillman (eds.), Dye Laser Principles (Academic, 1990) H√§nsch introduced the first narrow-linewidth tunable laser in 1972. Dye lasers and some vibronic solid-state lasers have extremely large bandwidths, allowing tuning over a range of tens to hundreds of nanometres.Koechner, ¬ß2.5, pp66‚Äì78. Titanium- doped sapphire is the most common tunable solid-state laser, capable of laser operation from 670 nm to nm wavelength. Typically these laser systems incorporate a Lyot filter into the laser cavity, which is rotated to tune the laser. Other tuning techniques involve diffraction gratings, prisms, etalons, and combinations of these.F. J. Duarte and L. W. Hillman (eds.), Dye Laser Principles (Academic, 1990) Chapter 4 Multiple-prism grating arrangements, in several configurations, as described by Duarte, are used in diode, dye, gas, and other tunable lasers.F.

It is a postprocess theory of writing instruction that tries to account for factors beyond hierarchically defined goals within social settings; however, it doesn't dismiss these goals. Rather, it incorporates them within an ecological view that extends the range of factors affecting the writing process beyond the social to include aspects such as \\"place\\" and \\"nature.\\" Its main motto, then, is \\"Writing Takes Place\\" (also the title of one of Sidney I. Dobrin's articles on ecocomposition). The theory for ecocomposition dates back to Marilyn Cooper's 1986 essay \\"The Ecology of Writing\\" and Richard Coe's \\"Eco-Logic for the Composition Classroom\\" (1975). More recently, Dobrin and Weisser (2002) have assembled a more detailed theory of ecocomposition, placing it in relation to ecofeminism, ecocriticism , and environmental ethics. Other scholars (e.g., Reynolds, 2004) have shown its close proximity to social geography. According to ecofeminist scholar Greta Gaard (2001), \\"at its most inclusive, ecocomposition has the potential to address social issues such as feminism, environmental ethics, multiculturalism, politics, and economics, all by examining matters of form and style, audience and argumentation, and reliable sources and documentation\\" (p. 163). Ecocomposition is one area of scholarly study discussed at the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), a national forum for writing instructors and scholars. As an educational endeavor, it is linked most closely with progressive education (Dewey, 1915), critical education (Giroux, 1987), and place-based education (Sobel, 2004). Ecocomposition asks what effects a place has (or different places have) on the writing process. In what ways is our identity influenced by place, and what bearing does this have on our writing? What sets of relationships help us define our place‚Äîincluding the relationship between writer and reader? How do the sometimes contradictory sets of relationships in which we write allow us to see certain possibilities and foreclose others? How do these relationships define reality for each of us in different ways? \\"Ecology\\", in the wide sense in which it was used by Coe and Cooper, includes both natural and social relations. Hence, ecocomposition instructors emphasize not only the writer's relationship to physical place but also the social relations among writers and readers. In the classroom, this translates into pedagogical practices that \\"emphasize the value of fostering community and collaboration throughout the writing process\\" (Gaard, 2001, p. 166). As a post-process method of writing instruction, ecocomposition attends not only to the process of writing but also what happens to texts after they are written. Thus, ecocomposition instructors focus not only on the process of composition but also on its purpose, encouraging students to write for specific audiences, adapting their style and content to match their purpose and audience. While a primary concern has been the relationship between the writing process and natural places, concepts of spatiality also apply to cyberspace and online writing‚Äîin MUDs, MOOs, Internet Relay Chat, Instant Messages, and e-mail (Syverson, 1999; Yagelski, 2002). Ecocomposition instructors may use blogs or other means by which to allow students to interact with one another and/or write for a real audience beyond the classroom (see, e.g., Jones, 2008). Ecocomposition should not be confused or conflated with other systemic approaches to writing such as activity theory, which do not account for the dynamic relationship between writing and place but posit a transcendent \\"context\\" that affects writing.

The core handles all packet processing and DNS intelligence, while one or more backends deliver DNS records using arbitrary storage methods. Zone transfers and update notifications are supported, and the processes can run unprivileged and chrooted. Various caches are maintained to speed up query processing. Run-time control is available through the pdns_control command, which allows reloading of separate zones, cache purges, zone notifications and dumps statistics in Multi Router Traffic Grapher / rrdtool format. Realtime information can also be obtained through the optional built-in web server. There are many independent projects to create management interfaces for PowerDNS. = DNSSEC = The PowerDNS Authoritative Server supports DNSSEC as of version 3.0. While pre-signed zones can be served, it is also possible to perform online signing & key management. This has the upside of being relatively easy, but the downside that the cryptographic keying material is present on the servers itself (which is also true of any HTTPS server when not used with a HSM for example).

The son of King Prishata, he was the king of the land of Southern Panchala. His capital was known as Kampilya.  Conflict with Drona  Drupada, son of King Prishata, and Drona study together under the tutelage of Rishi Bhardwaja, Drona's father. They become great friends and Drupada assures Drona that once he becomes king, he will share half of his kingdom with Drona. While Drupada becomes a king after the death of his father, Drona lives a life of poverty. Drona approaches Drupada for help; Drupada, now conscious of the difference of status between them, refuses to acknowledge Drona's friendship and shuns Drona, calling him a beggar. Drona is later employed by Bhishma to train the Kuru princes. After the military education of the Kauravas and the Pandavas ends, as his gurudakshina, Drona asks the princes to defeat and capture Drupada. Firstly, all the Kauravas, along with Karna, attack Drupada, but Drupada defeats all the Kauravas and Karna. Then the Pandavas led by Arjuna defeat Drupada, binding him in ropes and bringing him to Drona. Drona sets Drupada free, but retains half of the kingdom that had been promised to him. Humiliated, Drupada seeks vengeance but he realizes that he cannot match Drona's might. So, Drupada performed the Putrakameshti yajna to beget a son who could slay Drona. From the fire of the yajna, twins Dhrishtadyumna and Draupadi are born. Years later, Draupadi married Arjuna and later in the Mahabharata war, Dhrishtadyumna beheaded Drona.  Svayamvara of Draupadi  The Swayamvara of Panchala's princess, Draupadi King Drupada arranges a svayamvara for his daughter Draupadi. To win Draupadi's hand, the king's invitees, all of them royalty themselves, have to string an enormous bow and shoot five arrows simultaneously through a revolving ring onto the eye of a revolving fish. All the kings including Shalya and Karna fail to even string the bow. The five sons of the late King Pandu of Hastinapur are present at the Svayamvara, dressed as brahmins. Arjuna succeeds in the event and Draupadi accepts him as her husband, with Drupada somewhat reluctantly giving his permission. When Draupadi is taken back to Kunti, they decide to play a prank on her by announcing that they had brought some alms. Kunti asks her sons to share whatever had been brought. The imperative of acting on their mother's words and the propriety of marriage to five husbands is discussed at Drupada's palace, with Drupada and Dhristadyumna fiercely opposed to Draupadi marrying anyone other than Arjuna. However, sage Vyasa and Lord Krishna supports Kunti's proposal and sanctions the marriage, assuaging Drupada's fears.  Family  Different versions of the Mahabharata portray Drupada's family differently. Most versions name Satyajit, Dhristadyumna, Shikhandi (or Shikhandini), and Draupadi as his children. Uttamaujas and Yudhamanyu are often mentioned as two sons of Drupada who are the protectors of Arjuna's chariot. The Chatahurduri compilation mentions that Drupada has twelve sons, naming in addition to the aforementioned children: Kumar, Vrika, Panchalya, Suratha, Shatrunjaya.Story of Drupad Janmejaya is the nephew of Drupada, and father-in-law of Prativindhya. Notably, Satyajit's eventually ascends to Panchal's throne having eschewed the Kurukshetra War (some versions have Satyajit fighting and dying in the war with Prativindhya's or Sutasoma's son ascending the throne), Shikhandi was instrumental in the death of Bhishma, and Uttamaujas and Yudhamanyu protected Arjuna's chariot throughout the war. Dhrishtadyumna, Shikandi, Yudhamanyu, and Uttamaujas are killed by Ashwatthama on the last day of the war.  Role in Kurukshetra War  Drupada fights on the side of the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War.

Shaw, a Sumter County native, was assigned to the Royal Air Force 48 Squadron, as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Service.USAF Factsheet, 1st Lt. Ervin David Shaw Shaw died after three enemy aircraft attacked his Bristol F.2B while he was returning from a reconnaissance mission on 9 July 1918. Lt. Shaw downed one of his attackers before he was killed.Mueller, Robert (1989). Volume 1: Active Air Force Bases Within the United States of America on 17 September 1982. USAF Reference Series, Office of Air Force History, United States Air Force, Washington, D.C. , =World War II= Shaw Field was activated on 30 August 1941 and placed under the jurisdiction of the Army Air Corps Southeast Air Corps Training Center. The mission of the new airfield was a basic (Phase II) flying school to instruct air cadets in flying, and the Air Corps Basic Flying School was activated at the field on 26 June to operate the school. The airfield consisted of three runways and several auxiliary airfields.[Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942‚Äì2002.

Enough construction was completed for the first group of cadets entered training 15 December 1941, and the first class completed training in February 1942. The concrete parking ramp was completed during May 1942. In October 1942, the flight training was changed to Advanced (Phase III) flying training and AT-6 Texan single-engine and Beech AT-10 twin- engine trainers were used. During World War II, the Army Air Forces Pilot School, under the AAF Southeast Training Center trained more than 8,600 pilots in the basic and advanced flying curriculum, its graduates were then sent to Advanced Flight Training in single or multi-engine aircraft. On 1 April 1945 jurisdiction of Shaw Field was transferred to First Air Force. The 139th Army Air Force Base Unit, I Fighter Command became the host unit. and pilots were sent to Shaw for fighter transition training in Republic P-47 Thunderbolt single-engined fighters. For a brief time, Shaw Field also served as a prisoner-of-war camp. The first group of German POWs arrived on 1 March 1945. Eventually, 175 of them lived in an encampment just off the main base, on Peach Orchard Road (also known as South Carolina Hwy 441) across from Shaw's (side) hospital (currently closed) gate and worked on local farms in the area. They departed in the early months of 1946 for the rebuilding of European cities and towns that were devastated during the war. Those prisoners were eventually repatriated to Germany around 1947, with some returning to the Shaw and Sumter area and obtaining their U.S. citizenship.Shaw, Frederick J. (2004), Locating Air Force Base Sites History's Legacy, Air Force History and Museums Program, United States Air Force, Washington DC, 2004. =Postwar era= Shaw Army Airfield was designated a permanent Army Air Forces installation after the war, being transferred to Continental Air Forces on 16 April 1945. After a period of reorganization, jurisdiction was transferred to Air Defense Command on 1 March 1946. From July 1946 until May 1947 Shaw was the home of the 414th and 415th Night Fighter Squadrons. The squadrons flew the P-61 Black Widow in Europe with Ninth Air Force during World War II, and were reassigned back to the United States after the end of hostilities. The 414th was transferred to Caribbean Air Force at Rio Hato AB, Panama in March 1947 to perform an air defense mission of the Panama Canal. The 415th was reassigned to Alaska Air Command at Adak Island, Alaska in May 1947 also to perform an air defense mission, over the Aleutian Islands and the territorial waters of western Alaska. =United States Air Force= 20th Fighter Group 20th Fighter Group P-51D Mustangs parked at Shaw Field, November 1946.

Jurisdiction of Shaw was again transferred to Tactical Air Command on 23 March 1946. The 20th Fighter Group was reassigned to Shaw on 20 October 1946 from Biggs Army Airfield, Texas which was transferred to Strategic Air Command. The 20th FG came under Ninth Air Force.[20th Fighter Wing History, Office of History 20th Fighter Wing. Shaw AFB, South Carolina. December 2010, AFD-110131-026.pdf] After the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate military branch in September 1947, Shaw Army Airfield was renamed Shaw Air Force Base, on 13 January 1948 and the 20th Fighter-Bomber Wing was activated on 15 August 1947 with the implementation of the Hobson Plan. The 20th Fighter Group was first equipped with North American P-51D, then exchanged its P-51's in February 1948 for F-84B Thunderjets, the first TAC group to receive operational F-84s. The group was composed of the 55th, 77th and 79th Fighter Squadrons. The F-84s began arriving in February 1948 and ran through May when the full complement was received. Nine were lost in accidents before the remainder were returned to Republic Aircraft in May 1949 in exchange for F-84D models. Control over the wing changed hands on 1 February 1949 with its assignment to Fourteenth Air Force. On 23 September 1949 the 161st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was transferred to the 20th from the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Langley AFB Virginia. The 161st flew the Lockheed RF-80A reconnaissance version of the F-80 Shooting Star. A reduction in Air Force units in April 1949 led to a consolidation of units at fewer bases. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the mission of the 161st was to train replacement reconnaissance aircraft pilots. The 161st TFS became the nucleus on which the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing's mission at Shaw when the wing transferred there in 1951. The 20th Fighter Group was reassigned to Langley AFB, Virginia on 1 December 1951 in preparation for a permanent overseas deployment to RAF Wethersfield, England to support NATO.  363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing  McDonnell RF-4C-34-MC Phantom II, AF Serial No. 67-0436, of the 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, October 1986. Note the NATO European camouflage schema, \\"SW\\" tail code and low visibility USAF markings. This was one of the last RF-4Cs flown by the 363d TFW before their retirement in 1989. On 1 April 1951, the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was transferred to Shaw from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing would remain at Shaw, under various designations, for the next 43 years. The wing's mission was to fly photographic, electronic and electronic intelligence missions to support both air and ground operations by American or Allied ground forces through its operational component, the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Group. In addition, the 363d provided combat crew training for reconnaissance aircrews.Ravenstein, Charles A. (1984). Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947‚Äì1977. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. . In addition to the 363 TRW, Headquarters Ninth Air Force was transferred to Shaw from Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina on 1 September 1954. During the tenure of the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw AFB (1951‚Äì1993), the wing was the first USAF operational unit equipped with the following aircraft:Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia Of Military Aircraft * Martin RB-57A Canberra * Douglas RB-66 Destroyer * McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo * McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II Over the next four decades, the squadrons under the 363 TRW changed frequently. Nearly all tactical reconnaissance aircraft aircrews in the United States Air Force were trained or stationed at Shaw Air Force Base. = 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing = Martin RB-57A-MA, AF Serial No. 52-1457 of the 43d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. This aircraft is currently on static display at the Museum of Aviation, Robins AFB, Georgia. On 23 March 1953, the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Group was re-activated at Shaw. The group's mission at Shaw AFB was to assume the reconnaissance training mission that was handled previously by the 363d TRW. When elevated to the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing on 8 February 1958, the wing operated the USAF Advanced Flying Training School, Tactical Reconnaissance. The 432d TRW and 363d TRW both were under the 837th Air Division, headquartered at Shaw. The group initially conducted training with two squadrons (20th, 29th) flying the Republic RF-84F \\"Thunderflash\\" and two squadrons (41st, 43d) flying the Martin RB-57A \\"Canberra\\". In 1957, the group upgraded the 20th and 29th to the McDonnell RF-101C \\"Voodoo\\", and the 41st and 43d transitioned to the electronic warfare EB-66C Destroyer. In a budgetary move, the 432d TRW was inactivated on 8 April 1959. The RF-101C equipped 17th and 18th TRSs were deployed to NATO, being reassigned to the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Laon-Couvron Air Base, France. =4411th Combat Crew Training Group= The Shaw reconnaissance training mission was taken over by the 4411th Combat Crew Training Group, consisting of RF-101C and EB-66C aircraft. The 4411 CCTG became an operational group under the 363d TRW and continued the training mission at Shaw for reconnaissance aircraft until both it and the 837th Air Division were inactivated on 1 February 1963. All assets from these organizations were then transferred to the 363d TFW. =66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing= Lockheed F/RF-80C-10-LO Shooting Star, 49-1825, of the 366th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, shown at Sembach Air Base, West Germany after the wing's departure to NATO in 1953. On 1 January 1953 the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was activated at Shaw, replacing the 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the title of which reverted to the Tennessee Air National Guard after World War II, where the 66th Fighter Group served in the European theater as part of Eighth Air Force. The 66th Reconnaissance (later, Strategic Reconnaissance) Group, was a part of Strategic Air Command (SAC) from July 1947 ‚Äì May 1951, at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana as an Air Force Reserve corollary unit under the guidance of active duty units in order to train and maintain currency in reconnaissance operations for its reserve personnel. The 66 TRW was formed at Shaw from the RB-26 assets of the 18 TRS and RF-80s transferred from South Korea. Wing and squadrons trained at Shaw prior to deployment to NATO. The 66th had three operational squadrons: the 30th, 302d and 303d TRS. The 30 TRS flew the RB-26 Invader, equipped for night reconnaissance, while the 302d and 303d flew the RF-80A Shooting Star for day reconnaissance. On 25 June 1953, the 66 TRW departed Shaw, being reassigned to Sembach Air Base, West Germany. Just prior to the wing's deployment to NATO, the 303 TRS was reequipped with RF-80As. 363d Fighter Wing F-16C Block 42J Fighting Falcon, 90-754, of the 17th Fighter Squadron. After the squadron was inactivated on 31 December 1993, this aircraft was transferred to Luke AFB, Arizona where it has been used in F-16 pilot training, today being assigned to the 310th Fighter Squadron, 56th Operations Group. Fairchild Republic A-10A Thunderbolt II, AF Serial No. 79-0206, of the 21st Fighter Squadron, 29 September 1993. By 1980, the advent of reconnaissance satellites made the need for tactical aircraft reconnaissance less and less necessary. The aging and phaseout of the 1960s-era RF-4C aircraft fleet and the utility of the Lockheed TR-1 in Europe for tactical reconnaissance led to the decision by the USAF to realign the mission of the 363rd TRW. The reconnaissance training mission of the wing was terminated in 1981 and beginning in 1982, the wing would become 363d Tactical Fighter Wing (363d TFW), being equipped with General Dynamics F-16 aircraft. On 1 October 1981, the 363 TRW was re-designated .[Rogers, Brian (2005). United States Air Force Unit Designations Since 1978. Hinkley, England: Midland Publications. .][Martin, Patrick (1994). Tail Code: The Complete History of USAF Tactical Aircraft Tail Code Markings. Schiffer Military Aviation History. .] The 363 TFW received its first F-16 on 26 March 1982. The 363 TFW flew F-16A/B Block 10 aircraft until 1984 then converted to Block 15s; F-16C/D Block 25s in autumn 1985 and Block 42s in late 1991. All aircraft carried the \\"SW\\" Tail Code. On 9 August 1990, the 17 TFS and 33 TFS of 363 TFW became the first F-16 squadrons to deploy to the United Arab Emirates in Operation Desert Shield. Operating from Al Dhafra Air Base as the 363d Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional), along with the 10 TFS from the 50 TFW, Hahn Air Base, Germany. The wing flew combat missions to Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm between 17 January and 28 February 1991.F-16.net Following Desert Storm, the 19th and 33d Tactical Fighter Squadrons deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, a coalition effort to enforce the Iraqi \\"No Fly Zone\\" south of the 32nd parallel north. The 33 TFS made history when one of its pilots downed an Iraqi aircraft with an AIM-120 missile. The incident marked the first time an AIM-120 missile was fired in combat and was the first U.S. F-16 air-to-air kill. With the closure of Myrtle Beach Air Force Base South Carolina and the inactivation of the 354th Fighter Wing, the 21st Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated at Shaw and received 30 Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt IIs from the inactivating 355th Fighter Squadron on 1 April 1992. All A-10 aircraft with the 21 TFS were designated as OA-10A. As a result of the August 1992 destruction of Homestead AFB Florida by Hurricane Andrew in September 1992, the 31st Fighter Wing's 309th Fighter Squadron was initially evacuated to Shaw AFB prior to the hurricane making landfall. With Homestead unusable for an extended period after the hurricane, on 1 October 1992 the squadron was permanently assigned to the 363 FW. The 363rd Fighter Wing was inactivated at Shaw AFB on 31 December 1993. The next day, 1 January 1994, the 20th Fighter Wing inactivated at RAF Upper Heyford and reactivated without personnel or equipment at Shaw AFB, returning to the base it had left for duty with NATO forty-one years earlier. 20th Fighter Wing As a result of the end of the Cold War, the Air Force made several dramatic changes with the inactivation and re-designation of wings and their units. A significant reduction in forces in Europe was made in the early 1990s, which reflected the changes in Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. On 15 December 1993, the flight line at RAF Upper Heyford, England was closed and the host unit, the 20th Fighter Wing, was transferred from USAFE to Air Combat Command. The 20th was reassigned to Shaw AFB, replacing the 363d Fighter Wing as part of the USAF heritage program, which kept senior units on active duty and inactivated newer ones. Upon activation at Shaw, the 20 FW assumed the personnel and equipment of the inactivated 363 FW. The operational squadrons of the 363d Operations Group were assigned to the 20th Operations Group and re-designated as follows: * 17th Fighter Squadron -> 77th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D) * 19th Fighter Squadron -> 78th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D) * 21st Fighter Squadron -> 55th Fighter Squadron (OA-10A) * 309th Fighter Squadron -> 79th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D) 77th FS F-16C Block 50, 94‚Äì0046, at Incirlik AB, Turkey, 12 April 2003 after Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since moving to Shaw in 1994 the 20th has taken part and continues to take part in numerous operations. In September 1994 the 20 FW provided fighter cover for US operations in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. This operation restored democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who had been ousted in September 1991 by military forces within Haiti. The wing was called to send F-16s in support of NATO operations during the Kosovo War in April 1999. On 4 May 1999 an F-16, 91‚Äì0353, from the 78th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron flying out of Aviano Air Base, Italy, shot down a Yugoslavian MiG-29 (aircraft number 109). On 10 June 1999 NATO air operations were suspended. Throughout the 1990s the 20 FW routinely rotated squadrons to enforce the no-fly zones over Iraq. Southern Watch began in August 1992 and ended with the invasion of Iraq in 2003. 20 FW squadrons rotated in and out of the Middle East to support enforcement of the no-fly zone. The 20th routinely sent squadrons to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey supporting the no-fly zone in northern Iraq between January 1997 and March 2003. After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001, the Defense Department developed Noble Eagle to protect US soil in the War on Terrorism. The 20 FW has been tasked with providing patrols over New York City, Washington, DC and any other location the wing is called upon to protect. In addition to Noble Eagle tasking the 20th provides fighter cover for the President (POTUS) when traveling and at Camp David. In February 2003 the 20 FW deployed approximately 1,300 service members and 15 aircraft to the 363 AEW at Prince Sultan AB, Saudi Arabia, attached to the provisional CENTAF 363d Air Expeditionary Wing. This deployment was part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the United States actions for the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. In May 2008 the 77 FS deployed its aircraft and airmen along with maintainers from the 20 MXG to Joint Base Balad, where they conducted operations until relieved by the 55 FS in October 2008. The 55th carried out operations in Iraq until January 2009. During 2009 the three squadrons concentrated on regaining aircrew skill sets that atrophy during a combat deployment, in preparation for the next round of deployments. During 2010 the 55th and 77th once again fought in Iraq. The 77 FS again was the lead 20 FW unit deploying to Joint Base Balad, Iraq in January 2010. The 77th carried out operations there until relieved by the 55 FS in May 2010. The 55th finished its tour in Iraq in October 2010. The wing has been called to send both personnel and aircraft in support of operations in Afghanistan. One such deployment was in January 2007 when 150 Airmen deployed as part of an Air Expeditionary Force. During the October 2009 to February 2010 the 79 FS deployed its aircraft and airmen along with maintainers from the 20 MXG to Bagram AB, Afghanistan.  Third US Army  Emblem of the United States Third Army In its 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission Recommendations, DoD recommended to relocate the Third US Army Headquarters from Fort Gillem and Fort McPherson, Georgia, to Shaw AFB as a tenant unit on the base. This was a portion of a larger recommendation that would close Fort Gillem and Fort McPherson.US Third Army Website On 1 June 2011, Third Army Headquarters at Shaw, Patton Hall, was dedicated during a ribbon cutting ceremony for their new headquarters. Third Army continued the transfer of its personnel and equipment in order to be fully operational at Shaw AFB by 15 June 2011. An estimated 3,000 people relocated to the Sumter area, including families. This includes approximately 1,200 service members, who will be working out of the $100 million, command and control facility. The new Patton Hall took 22 months to build, has 42 conference rooms, a 200-seat auditorium and can support up to 1,500 personnel.Team Shaw Welcomes Third Army * Major commands to which assigned * Southeast Air Corps Training Center, 26 June 1941 : Redesignated: AAF Southeast Training Center, 29 October 1942 : Redesignated: Army Air Forces Eastern Flying Training Command, 31 July 1943 *First Air Force, 1 April 1945 *Continental Air Forces, 16 April 1945 *Air Defense Command, 1 March 1946 *Tactical Air Command, 23 March 1946 *Continental Air Command, 1 December 1948 *Tactical Air Command, 1 December 1950 *Air Combat Command, 1 June 1992 ‚Äì present =Major units assigned= * 77th Air Base Squadron, 1 August 1941 ‚Äì 10 July 1942 : Redesignated: 77th Base HQ and Air Base Squadron : 10 July 1942 ‚Äì 20 April 1944 * 2142d AAF Base Unit, 30 April 1944 ‚Äì 31 March 1945 * 139th AAF Base Unit, 31 March 1945 ‚Äì 31 March 1946 * 67th Reconnaissance Group, 11 February 1946 ‚Äì 31 March 1946 * 316th AAF Base Unit, 31 March 1946 ‚Äì 25 August 1948 * 20th Fighter Group (later Wing) : 20 October 1946 ‚Äì 1 December 1951; 1 January 1994 ‚Äì present * 161st (later 18th) Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Declassified Unit History, August 1944 ‚Äì April 1945) : 23 September 1949 ‚Äì 25 May 1959 * 437th Troop Carrier Wing, 1 August 1950 ‚Äì 16 October 1950 * 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (later Tactical Fighter), 6 November 1951 ‚Äì 31 December 1993 * 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 1 January 1953 ‚Äì 25 June 1953 * 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Group (later Wing), 18 March 1954 ‚Äì 18 June 1959 * Ninth Air Force (later dual-hatted as US Air Forces Central), 20 August 1954 ‚Äì present * 837th Air Division, 8 February 1958 ‚Äì 1 February 1963 * 4411th Combat Crew Training Group, 8 April 1959 ‚Äì 15 June 1969 * 4416th Test Squadron, 15 June 1963 ‚Äì 1 May 1970 * 682nd Air Support Operations Squadron, 1 December 1971 ‚Äì 15 June 2011  Role and operations  Today the 20th Fighter Wing remains at Shaw.

The symbol consists of a small raised circle, historically a zero glyph. History The first known recorded modern use of the degree symbol in mathematics is from 1657 page=216 where the usage seems to show that the symbol is a small raised zero, to match the prime symbol notation of sexagesimal subdivisions of degree such as minute, second, and third, which originate as small raised Roman numerals.  Typography  In the case of degrees of angular arc, the degree symbol follows the number without any intervening space, e.g. . The addition of minute and second of arc follows the degree units, with intervening spaces (optionally, non-breaking space) between the sexagesimal degree subdivisions but no spaces between the numbers and units, for example . In the case of degrees of temperature, three scientific and engineering standards bodies (the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Organization for Standardization and the U.S. Government Printing Office) prescribe printing temperatures with a space between the number and the degree symbol, e.g. . However, in many works with professional typesetting, including scientific works published by the University of Chicago Press or Oxford University Press, the degree symbol is printed with no spaces between the number, the symbol, and the Latin letters \\"C\\" or \\"F\\" representing Celsius or Fahrenheit, respectively, e.g. . This is also the practice of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Use of the degree symbol to refer to temperatures measured in kelvins (symbol: K) was abolished in 1967 by the 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM). Therefore, the triple point of water, for instance, is written simply as 273.16 K. The name of the SI unit of temperature is now \\"kelvin\\", in lower case, and no longer \\"degrees Kelvin\\". In photography, the symbol is used to denote logarithmic film speed grades. In this usage, it follows the number without spacing as in 21¬∞ DIN, 5¬∞ ASA or ISO 100/21¬∞. Encoding The degree sign is included in Unicode as . For use with Chinese characters there are also code points for and . The degree sign was missing from the basic 7-bit ASCII set of 1963, but in 1987 the ISO/IEC 8859 standard introduced it at position 0xB0 (176 decimal) in all variants except Part 5 (Cyrillic), 6 (Arabic), 7 (Greek) and 11 (Thai). In 1991 the Unicode standard incorporated all of the ISO/IEC 8859 code points, including the degree sign (at U+00B0).. The Windows Code Page 1252 was also an extension of ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Part 1 or Latin-1) standard, so it had the degree sign at the same code point, 0xB0. The code point in the older DOS Code Page 437 was 0xF8 (248 decimal); therefore, the Alt code used to enter the symbol directly from the keyboard is .  Lookalikes  Other characters with similar appearance but different meanings include: * (indicator used in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese that follows a numeral denoting that it is an ordinal number, rather than a cardinal number; varies with the font and sometimes underlined) * (superscript letter o) * (standalone) ** (applied to a letter) ** (applied to a letter) ** (applied to a letter) * (standalone) ** (applied to a letter) ** (precomposed characters containing this mark also exists) * (stand alone, typically representing either or ) ** (precomposed characters containing this mark also exists) (used in superscripted form, ‚¶µ, to mean standard state (chemistry)) * *Keyboard entry Some computer keyboard layouts, such as the QWERTY layout as used in Italy, the QWERTZ layout as used in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the AZERTY layout as used in France and Belgium, have the degree symbol available directly on a key. But the common keyboard layouts in English-speaking countries do not include the degree sign, which then has to be input some other way. The method of inputting depends on the operating system being used. On the Colemak keyboard layout (Windows/Mac), one can press + followed by to insert a degree sign. On Linux, one can press + twice to insert a degree sign. =Desktop OS= With Microsoft Windows, there are several ways to make the degree symbol: * One can type or Note: \\"0176\\" is different from \\"176\\"; produces the light shade (‚ñë) character. Note: The NumLock must be set first; on full size keyboards, the numeric keypad must be used; on laptops without a numerical keypad, the virtual numeric keypad must be used (often requiring that the key be held down as the numeric sequence is typed). * The Character Map tool also may be used to obtain a graphical menu of symbols. * The US-International English keyboard layout creates the degree symbol with In the classic Mac OS and macOS operating systems, the degree symbol can be entered by typing . One can also use the Mac OS character palette, which is available in many programs by selecting Special Characters from the Edit Menu, or from the 'Input Menu' (flag) icon on the menu bar (enabled in the International section of the System Preferences). In Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, this symbol may be entered via the Compose key followed by , . Some keyboard layouts display this symbol upon pressing (once or twice, depending on specific keyboard layout), and, in programs created by GTK+, one can enter Unicode characters in any text entry field by first pressing , regardless of keyboard layout. For the degree symbol, this is done by entering (where the last key is the number zero) followed by a space. For Chrome OS, use the Unicode entry method then then space or return; with the UK extended layout, use . =Mobile OS= In iOS, the degree symbol is accessed by pressing and holding and dragging a finger to the degree symbol. This procedure is the same as entering diacritics on other characters. In Android, switch to numbers then symbols . The degrees symbol is found on the second row. =Software-specific= In Microsoft Office and similar programs, there is often also an Insert menu with an Insert Symbol or Symbol command that brings up a graphical palette of symbols to insert, including the degree symbol. As with the CharMap app, the table is arranged in unicode order. An easier way is to use or then . In LaTeX, the packages \`gensymb\` and \`textcomp\` provide the commands and \`textdegree\`, respectively. In the absence of these packages one can write the degree symbol as \`^{circ}\` in math mode. In other words, it is written as the empty circle glyph as a superscript. In AutoCAD it is available as a shortcut string .

In the epic, she is the sister of Krishna and Balarama, wife of Arjuna , mother of Abhimanyu and grandmother of Parikshit. She is the daughter of Vasudev and his first wife Rohini. Subhadra is known as Veera sodari (brave sister), Veera Patni (brave wife) and Veera mata (brave mother) due to her relationship with Krishna, Arjuna and Abhimanyu respectively. Subhadra is one of the three deities worshipped at the Jagannath temple at Puri, along with Krishna (as Jagannatha) and Balarama (or Balabhadra). One of the chariots in the annual Ratha Yatra is dedicated to her.  Legends  =Marriage= Vyasa's Mahabharata, when Arjuna was in the midst of self-imposed pilgrimage, for breaking terms of the agreement he had with his brothers regarding private time with their common wife Draupadi. He reached the city of Dwarka and meets Krishna with whom he spends time. Later he attends a festival held at Raivata mountain alongside Krishna. Other Yadava women including Subhadra were also there to see the festival. After seeing Subhadra, Arjuna is smitten by her beauty and wishes to marry her. Arjuna met with Krishna at night seeking advice about Subhadra and what action to take, Krishna said he does not know what will be her decision in a swayamvara advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadra stating \\"in the case of Kshatriyas that are brave, a forcible abduction is applauded as the learned have said\\" Thus Arjuna agrees to kidnap and run away with Subhadra. Mahabharata does not opine about Subhadra's consent. Later, Bhagawat Purana narrates about Balarama's picking of Duryodhan as Subhadra‚Äôs groom without taking her consent and also her reciprocation to feelings of Arjuna.Indians know all about Draupadi and Sita, but ignore what was done to Subhadra in Mahabharata The Print Knowing that after getting the news of Subhadra's kidnap, Balarama would wage a war against Arjuna, Krishna decided he will be the charioteer for Arjuna. Arjuna Proceeds to kidnap Subhadra and with Krishna in tow they leave. After getting the news that Arjuna had kidnapped Subhadra and seeing Subhadra stowed on the chariot, Balarama and other Yadavas are angered by this and decide to pursue Arjuna who successfully held them off. After escaping Krishna returned and dissuaded them. Finally, Balarama consents and conduct the marriage of Subhadra with Arjuna in Dwarka. =Impression on Draupadi= Subhadra meets Draupadi and Kunti Draupadi had told the Pandavas that she would not share her household with any other woman. When Arjuna returned from his exile to Indraprastha along with Subhadra, he was welcomed by his brothers. When he asked about Draupadi, his brothers told that she is in rage and doesn't want to meet anybody. To save her husband from Draupadi's rage, Subhadra went to the chamber of the fire born empress. When Draupadi asked who she was, Subhadra replied that she is a cow herder and has come to serve you. Subhadra then fell down to Draupadi's feet and told that she never wants to replace her. After such humility, Draupadi hugged Subhadra, and accepted her as her younger sister. = Death = After Parikshit was seated on the throne of Hastinapur and the Pandavas along with Draupadi had reached heaven, Subhadra and UttarƒÅ went to the forests to live as hermits. It is believed they died of natural causes in the forest. Another version of the story is that Krishna, Subhadra and Arjun went to a waterbody. Krishna asked Arjun to push Subhadra into the pond. Arjun was confused but did as he was told. Subhadra was pushed into the water and when she came out she was in a demonic form. In her previous birth she was a demon, Trijata, who was in Lanka when Sita was kidnapped. Trijata had served Sita and helped her for which she was given a boon by Ram to be reborn as the sister of Krishna. After this, Subhadra died. Another version says that Trijata performed severe austerities to be reborn as a human. Due to her penance she was reborn as Subhadra.  Worship  Subhadra in the middle with her brothers Balabhadra (Balarama) and Jagannath (Krishna) Subhadra (in Jagannath Temple, Puri) Hindus believe Subhadra to be a goddess named Yogmaya. Subhadra is one of the three deities worshipped at the Jagannath temple at Puri, along with Krishna (as Jagannatha) and Balarama (or Balabhadra). One of the chariots in the annual Ratha Yatra is dedicated to her. Apart from it she is also believed to be worshipped by certain communities in Odisha, West Bengal, Gujarat and Bangladesh.* In popular culture *In B. R.

The current version of Norton Utilities is Norton Utilities 16 for Windows XP/Vista/7/8 was released 26 October 2012. Peter Norton published the first version for DOS, The Norton Utilities, Release 1, in 1982. Release 2 came out about a year later, subsequent to the first hard drives for the IBM PC line. Peter Norton's company was sold to Symantec (now known as NortonLifeLock) in 1990 and Peter Norton himself no longer has any connection to the brand or company. Norton Utilities for DOS and Windows 3.1 =Version 1.0= The initial 1982 release supported DOS 1.x and featured the UNERASE utility. This allowed files to be undeleted by restoring the first letter of the directory entry (a workaround of the FAT file system used in DOS). The UNERASE utility was what launched NU on its path to success. Quoting Peter Norton, \\"Why did The Norton Utilities become such popular software? Well, industry wisdom has it that software becomes standard either by providing superior capabilities or by solving problems that were previously unsolvable. In 1982, when I sat down at my PC to write Unerase, I was solving a common problem to which there was no readily available solution.\\" 14 programs were included, on three floppy disks, list price $80: * UnErase, recovers erased files * FileFix, repairs damaged files * DiskLook, complete floppy disk displays and maps * SecMod, easy changes to floppy disks * FileHide, interactive hidden file control * BatHide, automatic hidden file control * TimeMark, displays date, time, elapsed time * ScrAtr, sets DOS to work in any colors * Reverse, work in black on white * Clear, clears the screen for clarity * FileSort, keeps floppy disk files by date or name * DiskOpt, speeds floppy disk access * Beep, causes the PC speaker to beep * Print, prints files =Version 2.0= The main feature of this DOS 2.x compatible version was FILEFIND, used for searching for files. This 1983 release added hard disk support, and the PRINT program was renamed LPRINT to avoid conflict with the DOS command introduced in MS-DOS 2.0 as PRINT.COM. Following this release Norton became Utilities Editor of PC Magazine. The executable files were compressed with Realia's Spacemaker. =Version 3.0= This version, copyrighted 1984 but dated 21 January 1985, included Beep, Directory Sort, Disk Test, File Attributes, File Find, File Size, Line Print, List Directories, Screen Attributes, System Information, Text Search, Time Mark, Volume Label, Wipe Disk and Wipe File. =Version 3.1= This 1986 version added the Quick UnErase (QU) and Unremove Directory (UD) programs. =Version 4.0= Norton Utilities 4.0 for DOS Release 4.0 (1987, list $99.95) added four new programs: * Ask, used for batch file programming * File Info, add descriptions up to 65 characters long to each file * Norton Change Directory, displays a graphic directory tree; change, remove, rename or make directories * Norton Integrator, a menu system to tie the utilities together. Previously the utilities were accessed by typing the command name (usually a cryptic 2 character name such as FF) at the DOS prompt. =Version 4.0 Advanced Edition= This version (list $150), released simultaneously with 4.0 standard edition, was dated 15 May 1987. It added Speed Disk, a disk defragmenter, and Format Recover. =Version 4.5 Advanced Edition= Norton Integrator from Norton Utilities 4.5 for DOS Norton Disk Doctor was the major addition in this 1988 release. It also includes Wipedisk; Wipefile, a Batch Enhancer and a sector level disk editor; a system information diagnostic utility and a disk caching program (NCACHE), which was between 10 - 50% faster than Microsoft's SMARTDrive when properly configured. =Version 5.0= Release 5.0 added new features, including Disk Editor, a utility to perform low level formatting on hard disks and changes such as password protection on the more ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù utilities. It also included a licensed version of the 4DOS replacement for COMMAND.COM called NDOS. This version also allowed the choice of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù names (such as FF.EXE) or longer names (such as FINDFAST.EXE); these were configurable in the updated version of the Norton Integrator menu system. =Version 6.0= Norton Utilities 6.0 for DOS Norton Utilities 6.0 supports DOS 5 and Windows 3.1. It includes Windows Program Manager support, but the tools are still DOS-based, so a set of icons were supplied. It includes Norton Disk Doctor, Disk Editor, Disk Tools, Speed Disk, Norton Cache, Disk Monitor, Diskreet, NDisk, System Information, NDOS. The speed of Speed Disk was improved over the previous release. Diskreet supports Data Encryption Standard. System Information now includes more detailed information on installed system. UnErase takes advantage of DOS 5.0's Delete Tracking and Mirror File features to recover data.InfoWorld, 1991-06-10, p. 117 However, MS-DOS 5.0 added a new \`UNDELETE.exe\` program, licensed from Norton competitor Central Point Software,Upon executing the UNDELETE command in MS-DOS 6.22, the message: \\"UNDELETE - A delete protection facility Copyright (C) 1987-1993 Central Point Software, Inc.\\" is displayed. which took advantage of the same Delete Sentry control and Deletion-tracking files. (The ERASE command is an alias for the DEL (Delete) command in the DOS command line). Windows 95's Recycle Bin soon further reduced the need for UnErase. =Version 7.0= Release 7.0 supports MS-DOS 6.0, DoubleSpace, Stacker and SuperStor disk compression tools. Tools includes Norton Disk Doctor, Disk Editor, Undelete, SmartCan, NDOS, System Information, File Find, Norton Change Directory. Speed Disk remained as well, although \`SPEEDISK.exe\` was licensed by Microsoft and incorporated into MS-DOS as \`DEFRAG.exe\` in MS-DOS 6.0 onward.Upon executing the DEFRAG command in MS- DOS 6.22, the message: \\"Microsoft Defrag for MS-DOS Copyright 1988-1993 Symantec Corporation\\" is displayed. \\"About MS-DOS Defragmenter\\" also states, \\"Technology from the Norton Utilities\\" Release 7.0 had revised user interfaces for the utilities that feature a menu-driven user interface. Also some of these tools now did not need to run in full-screen-mode but just displayed a window in the center of the screen, like the disk formatter or the disk duplicator utility. Disk Editor now includes Advanced Recovery Mode. =Version 8.0 for DOS/Windows 3.x= Release 8.0 was nearly the same as 7.0, but added Windows 3.1 utilities. DOS Utilities include Norton Disk Doctor, System Information, Change Directory, FileFind, Diskreet, DUPDISK, File Fix, NDOS, Batch Enhancer, Norton Integrator, Speed Disk. Windows utilities include Norton Disk Doctor, Speed Disk, System Watch, File Compare, INI Tracker, INI Tuner, INI editor, INI Advisor Norton Utilities for Windows 95 and later =Version 1.0 for Windows 95= The original Windows 95 version was released in August 1995. As a native Windows 95 tool, it supports the VFAT file system used by Windows 95. It includes Norton Image, Norton System Doctor, Norton Protection, Rescue Disk, System Information, Norton Disk Doctor, Norton UnErase, Space Wizard, Speed Disk, System Information. DOS tools include Disk Editor, Disk Doctor, Pre-Installation TuneUp. CD-ROM version was announced on 15 January 1996. It adds Disk Companion, Memory Companion and Norton Utilities Companion over floppy disk version. Disk tools included with this release are not compatible with FAT32. The Windows version of Speed Disk works with much greater speed than Microsoft's supplied defrag program, as it moved groups of clusters, not single clusters as Microsoft's Windows Disk Defragmenter. Changes in the way Windows operates meant that many of the old utilities were either dropped completely or replaced with GUI based versions. However, with the advent of Windows XP onwards, Norton's Speed Disk reverted to single- cluster defragmentation. =Version 2.0 for Windows 95= Version 2.0 was announced on 7 October 1996. Version 2.0 features Norton CrashGuard with Anti- Freeze, Norton System Genie, Norton AntiVirus, LiveUpdate, System Genie, Registry Editor, System Doctor, System Benchmark, Disk Benchmark, Multimedia Benchmark, Speed Disk, Space Wizard. Disk utilities now support FAT32.New and Newer A LiveUpdate fix was released for Norton Utilities 2.0 for Windows 95. =Version 2.0 for Windows NT 4.0= Originally called Norton Utilities 2.0 for Windows NT during prerelease, it was announced on 27 January 1997. It includes Norton Disk Doctor, Norton Speed Disk, Norton System Information, Norton System Doctor, Norton Protection/UnErase, Live Update. Norton Disk Doctor, Speed Disk support FAT16 and NTFS file systems. It does not include DOS UnErase, so files deleted from FAT partition needs to be handled by Norton Utilities for Windows 95/98. =Version 3.0 for Windows 95= Officially announced on 10 November 1997, Norton Utilities 3.0 was the first version of to be included in Norton SystemWorks, it includes Norton WinDoctor, Norton Web Services, LiveUpdate Pro, Norton CrashGuard 3.0, Norton Zip Rescue, Norton System Doctor, Norton SpeedStart, Norton Optimization Wizard, Speed Disk. Via the use of LiveUpdate, a Speed Disk patch is available to take advantage of Windows 98's application launch enhancements. Marketing Symantec announced it had sponsored a bug-a-thon between USC and UCLA during the final development stages of the latest product release of Norton Utilities 3.0. The software began shipping on 21 November 1997. =Version 4.0= Symantec announced version 4.0 on 16 February 1999. Although the 'for Windows' name was dropped from the products, it still appears in support sites. New additions include Windows 98 support, Norton SystemCheck, Registry Doctor Scan, Norton WinDoctor, Connection Doctor, Norton Wipe Info, Norton CrashGuard 4.0, Norton Zip Rescue, Norton Disk Doctor, Norton UnErase, a six-month subscription to Norton Web Services for $6.95. Marketing On 13 May 1999, Symantec offered price reduction and rebates on Norton SystemWorks 2.0 and Norton Utilities 4.0. Early order includes Net Nanny Internet filter software. =Release 2000 (Version 4.5)= With this release, Symantec changed the naming scheme to incorporate the year of release.

Disk tools now supports USB and FireWire drives. =Release 2002 (Version 6.0)= In anticipation of major changes to the Norton product lineup, no new features were introduced in this release. NU 2002 introduced Windows XP compatibility while dropping support for Windows 95. Utilities include Norton Speed Disk, Norton System Doctor, Norton UnErase, Norton Disk Doctor, Norton WinDoctor, System Information and Wipe Info. =Release 2003= For the next six years, Norton Utilities will cease to exist as standalone product, instead becoming part of Norton SystemWorks starting 2003. SystemWorks is essentially an expanded version of Norton Utilities with additional features, antivirus protection and disk backup tool. =Release 2004= It was only included with Norton SystemWorks 2004. =Release 2005= It was only included with Norton SystemWorks 2005.

It includes Registry Defragmenter, Registry Cleaners, Disk Cleaner, Disk Defragmenter, Startup Manager, Service Manager, Restore Center, System Optimizer, Process Viewer, and Performance Test. The product license was changed to allow the software to be installed on up to three household PCs.  Critical Receptions  PC Pro rated Norton Utilities 14 with 1 star (out of 6) for ‚Äúan overpriced collection of optimization tools that falls far short of its promise. IT Reviews called the package ‚Äúlight on features compared to rivals‚Äù and it questioned the ‚Äúusefulness of some of the monitoring utilities.http://www.itreviews.co.uk/software/s772.htm IT Reviews PC Advisor criticized Norton Utilities 14 for delivering ‚Äúlittle that you can't already do with Windows‚Äù, although it did acknowledge that it brought two things to the table: ‚ÄúThe registry tools, which are useful, and the performance monitor, which is interesting but not always useful.‚Äùhttp://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=113853&pn;=2 PC Advisor  Premier edition  Symantec has released a version of Norton Utilities which is called Norton Utilities Premier Edition.

Norton Utilities for Macintosh was a separate utility suite for the Mac OS, providing much of the same features as the equivalent Windows version. =Version 1.0= Originally released in 1990, requiring a Mac Plus with 1 MB of system memory. The included disk tools support the HFS file system only. Support for the Apple Hard Disk 20 was not explicitly mentioned. When Apple released System 7, Norton Utilities for the Macintosh needed to be updated in order to run safely. This proved to be a recurring story in the history of the utility; early versions were highly regarded for a while, but proved to be hazardous when used with newer disk structures and operating systems before being updated. =Version 2.0= Originally released in 1992. It includes Disk Editor, Norton Backup for Macintosh. It also added features in Symantec Utilities for Macintosh II. =Version 3.x= 3.0 was originally released in August 1994. It supports PowerPC but Speed Disk 3.0 can cause data loss. * Version 3.1 was released in September 1994, correcting problems with Speed Disk =Version 3.2= Released in October 1995, v3.2 added support for volumes larger than 4 GB, up to 2 TB to match System 7.5.2 disk size limit. This edition was bundled with new Small Business Macintosh 6500/250 and 4400/200. * Version 3.2.1 Update from 3.2 * Version 3.2.3 Update from 3.2.x * Version 3.2.4 Update from 3.2.x fix for Mac OS 7.6 =Version 3.5= Announced on 12 May 1997, v3.5 is the first version of Norton Utilities for Macintosh to ship on CD-ROM.

Mac OS X tools run on PowerPC G3 Mac (except Beige G3). However, the Mac OS X tools have not been tested on Mac OS X later than 10.2.6, and is known to be incompatible with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther). Features: Norton Disk Doctor, Speed Disk, FileSaver, UnErase, Volume Recover, LiveUpdate. Speed Disk does not run on Mac OS X, except by booting with Norton Utilities 7.0 CD. =Version 8.0= The package of v8.0 was simply labeled 'Norton Utilities 8.0', but it was called Norton Utilities for Macintosh 8.0 in support pages. All Mac OS X tools now run natively, but the CD can still boot into Mac OS 9. It includes Wipe Info, Speed Disk, Volume Recover, Norton FileSaver, UnErase, LiveUpdate. 8.0.1 added support of Mac OS X 10.3. 8.0.2 added support of G5 model Macintosh released before December 2004, 1.25 GHz eMac, and various Mac G4 notebooks. However, some tools may present errors when running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger). =End of life= In 2004, Symantec confirmed it had stopped developing Norton Utilities for Macintosh and Norton SystemWorks for Macintosh, and concentrate its efforts solely on Internet security products for the Mac. Symantec Utilities for Macintosh Symantec Utilities for Macintosh (SUM) was a set of system utilities from Symantec, developed before Symantec had acquired Peter Norton Computing. SUM started out as a revised version of the MacZap data recovery tools and included utilities for data recovery, disk partitioning, disk defragmentation, and floppy disk duplication, among others. Later SUM tools may have shared code with Norton Utilities for Macintosh. Some of the functionality from SUM II was incorporated into Norton Utilities 2.0. SUM v1.1 was published in 1988 and required a Mac 512Ke or later system. This version also had limited support for MFS-formatted floppy disks. SUM II was announced for release in August 1989 and included tools for data backup and data encryption. SUM II v2.0 runs on Macs with System 4.2 or higher and 1 MB of memory. One review mentioned that it was easy to make use of most of SUM II's utilities, but at the same time, the file recovery functionality in SUM II was less automated and required more manual configuration compared to the file recovery functionality in Norton Utilities.

The longest-running prime-time series in the history of television, it first aired in 1951 and continues into the present day. From 1954 onward, all of its productions have been broadcast in color. It was one of the first video productions to telecast in color, a rarity in the 1950s. Many television movies have been shown on the program since its debut, though the program began with live telecasts of dramas and then changed to videotaped productions before finally changing to filmed ones. The series has received eighty-one Emmy Awards, dozens of Christopher and Peabody Awards, nine Golden Globes, and Humanitas Prizes. Once a common practice in American television, it is one of the last remaining television programs where the title includes the name of its sponsor. Unlike other long- running TV series still on the air, it differs in that it broadcasts only occasionally and not on a weekly broadcast programming schedule. The Hall of Fame films have an above average budget and production values nearing that of a feature film. History =Early years= The series is the direct descendant of two old-time radio dramatic anthologies sponsored previously by Hallmark: Radio Reader's Digest, adapting stories from the popular magazine (though the magazine never sponsored the show); and, its successor, Hallmark Playhouse, which premiered on CBS in 1948. The Hallmark Playhouse changed to more serious literature from all genres. Hallmark Television Playhouse debuted on December 24, 1951 on NBC television network first opera written specifically for television, Amahl and the Night Visitors featuring the ballet dancer Nicholas Magallanes.Amahl and the Night Visiotrs - Nicholas Magallanes in the cast on imdb.com Playhouse was hosted by Sarah Churchill and was a weekly half-hour. In 1953, the series was renamed Hallmark Hall of Fame. It was the first time a major corporation developed a television project specifically as a means of promoting its products to the viewing public. The program was such a success that it was restaged by Hallmark several times during a period of fifteen years. Amahl was also staged by other NBC television anthologies. Under the supervision of creative executives at its advertising agency, Foote, Cone, and Belding in Chicago, Hallmark also transformed its radio Hallmark Playhouse into a Hallmark Hall of Fame format‚Äîthis time, featuring stories of pioneers of all types in America‚Äîfrom 1953 through 1955. Early productions included some of the classical works of Shakespeare: Hamlet, Richard II, The Taming of the Shrew, Macbeth, Twelfth Night, and The Tempest. Biographical subjects were very eclectic, ranging from Florence Nightingale to Father Flanagan to Joan of Arc. Popular Broadway plays such as Harvey, Dial M for Murder, and Kiss Me, Kate were made available to a mass audience, most of them with casts that had not appeared in the film versions released to theatres. In a few cases, the actors repeated their original Broadway roles. Actors such as Richard Burton, Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Maurice Evans, Katharine Cornell, Julie Harris, Laurence Olivier and Peter Ustinov all made what were then extremely rare television appearances in these plays. Two different productions of Hamlet have been broadcast on the Hallmark Hall of Fame, one featuring Maurice Evans (1953) and the other a British one featuring Richard Chamberlain (1970). Neither version was more than two hours long. Evans and actress Judith Anderson performed their famous stage Macbeth on the Hallmark Hall of Fame on two separate occasions, each time with a different supporting cast. The first version in 1954 was telecast live from NBC's Brooklyn color studio while the second in 1960 was filmed on location in Scotland and released to movie theaters in Europe after its American telecast. The Richard Chamberlain version of Hamlet, which was also telecast in Britain on ITV Sunday Night Theatre, won five Emmys when telecast on the Hallmark Hall of Fame, out of a total of thirteen nominations. It may have set a record for the most-nominated Shakespeare production to ever be televised. In 1955, Hallmark Hall of Fame switched its format to a special series seen only four to eight times a year around greeting card holidays and in 90-minute or 120-minute length. Starting in 1970, the frequency dropped to two to three times a year. The source material were plays and novel from major authors and were produced with stage actors and actresses. Hamlet, Macbeth and the other Shakespeare plays presented on Hallmark Hall of Fame were cut (sometimes drastically) to fit the time limits of a standard film or of the Hallmark Hall of Fame itself, which during the 1950s, '60s and '70s never ran longer than two hours and frequently even less. It was left to National Educational Television (NET) and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) to be the pioneers in presenting nearly complete Shakespeare productions on American television. As a result of Foote, Cone, and Belding Advertising executive and producer Duane C. Bogie's influence, Hallmark Hall of Fame began to offer original material, such as Aunt Mary (1979) and Thursday's Child (1983), although its lineup still primarily consisted of expensive-looking Masterpiece Theatre-style adaptations of American and European literary classics, such as John Steinbeck's The Winter of Our Discontent (1983), Robert Louis Stevenson's The Master of Ballantrae (1984), and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities (1980), Oliver Twist (1982), and A Christmas Carol (1984). A Tale of Two Cities was the first Hallmark production (and to date, one of the very few) to run three hours. The late 1980s featured productions such as Foxfire (1987), My Name is Bill W. (1989), Sarah, Plain and Tall (1991), O Pioneers! (1992), To Dance With the White Dog (1993), The Piano Lesson (1995), and What the Deaf Man Heard (1997). One installment, Promise (1986), featuring James Garner and James Woods, won five Emmys, two Golden Globes, a Peabody award, a Humanitas Prize, and a Christopher Award. =Post-NBC = For nearly three decades the series was broadcast by NBC, but the network cancelled it in 1979 due to declining ratings. Since then, the series has been televised by CBS from 1979 to 1989 (except for briefly on PBS in 1981), then on ABC from 1989 to 1994. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Hallmark Hall of Fame movies often had twice the budget of other network movies. Hallmark movies also ran (in some cases) approximately 10‚Äì15 minutes longer (or up to 110 minutes minus commercials) because Hallmark Cards fully sponsored the movies and had fewer commercial breaks. Unlike most network movies of the period, Hallmark always filmed on location, and usually filmed for 24 days, compared to 18‚Äì20 days for most other TV-movies. Richard Welsh Company was retained in 1982 to work on developing HoF projects. Brad Moore was placed in charge of the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1983. In February 1992, Hallmark Cards had formed Signboard Hill Productions as sister production company leveraging HHOFP management and expertise to produce some Hall of Fame movies. CBS picked up the series again from 1994 until 2011 (16 years), when that network cancelled the series due to low ratings. The series was three movies a year with the last one, Beyond the Blackboard, on April 24, 2011. On November 27, 2011, Hallmark Hall of Fame returned to ABC with Have a Little Faith, which debuted to very low ratings for the night. The total number of viewers was estimated at 6.5 million, compared to 13.5 million for the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of November Christmas on the weekend after Thanksgiving in 2010. Encore broadcasts of these ABC episodes aired on Hallmark Channel a week after their initial broadcast on ABC. The films were also available for streaming on the website Feeln.com a few days after airing. In September 2014, it was announced that the Hallmark Hall of Fame will air exclusively on the Hallmark Channel for the foreseeable future, ending the program's 63-year run on broadcast television. The first episode to debut on Hallmark Channel was One Christmas Eve, starring Anne Heche. On the cable channel, four original movies at most would air as a part of the Hall of Fame with multiple encores. The HHOF library would also be available. In February 2016, Hallmark Cards, which had been directly involved in the production of Hall of Fame from its inception, would transfer the series' division to a subsidiary, Crown Media Productions. Hallmark Cards will still continue to sponsor the program and oversee the creative process.  Episodes  Only a small number of Hallmark Hall of Fame episodes have been released on VHS and DVD. The 1960 production of the Tempest and the 1966 production of Lamp at Midnight were released as VHS tapes by Films for the Humanities; they have not been released in DVD format. Hallmark Hall of Fame division does not own most of the films from the series from 1951 to the 1970s. Hallmark Channel since 1999 has attempted to gain rights to these movies. Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions LLC (HHOFP) is a TV film production company that produces films for the Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions and is owned by Crown Media Productions. Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions' first credited film was an adaptation of The Tempest in 1960. Richard Welsh Company was retained in 1982 to work on developing HoF projects. Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions, Inc. was incorporated on September 27, 1994. In February 1992, Hallmark Cards had formed Signboard Hill Productions as sister production company leveraging HHOFP management and expertise.

Domenico Grimani (19 February 1461 - 27 August 1523) was an Italian nobleman, theologian and cardinal. Like most noble churchman of his era Grimani was an ecclesiastical pluralist, holding numerous posts and benefices. Desiderius Erasmus dedicated to Grimani his Musica. Biography Born in Venice, he was the eldest of five sons of Antonio Grimani, the oldest elected Doge of Venice, and his wife Catarina Loredan. Antonio was elected doge in 1521, when Domenico was already a cardinal. He exhibited an early predilection for humanist studies, which was encouraged by teachers in his native Venice and then in the ambit of the Medicean academy in Florence, where he moved in the circle of Lorenzo de' Medici among scholars like Pico della Mirandola and Poliziano. He obtained a doctorate in canon law at the University of Padua on 23 October 1487 and was elected a Senator of Venice that same year. He became a cardinal in 1493, an appointment paid by his father with a sum of around 25,000/30,000 ducats. Grimani was not ordained a priest until 1498. After the election of Pope Julius II he became cardinal priest of San Marco. After a period as apostolic administrator in Nicosia, starting from 1498 he was Patriarch of Aquileia, a position he abandoned in favor of his nephew Marino (later also cardinal) in 1517. In 1508 he was named cardinal bishop of Albano, and was also administrator of the diocese of Urbino (from 1514) and bishop of Ceneda (1517-1520). Grimani was already ill in the 1521 conclave, and died one year and a half later; he was buried in the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome, but later his remains were moved to San Francesco della Vigna. Legacy Grimani was a large collector, owning works by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Giorgione, Titian, Hans Memling, Hieronymus Bosch, Raphael and others: his collection now forms part of the Museo d'Antichit√† in the Doge's Palace in Venice, while several of his codexes are in the Archbishop's Library at Udine. The Grimani Breviary, now in the Biblioteca Marciana of Venice, is a key work in the late history of Flemish illuminated manuscripts. It was produced in Ghent and Bruges ca 1515-1520 and by 1520 owned, though possibly not originally commissioned, by Domenico Grimani. Several leading artists, including Simon Bening and Gerard David contributed some of their finest work to it. Grimani also wrote several theological treatises, and translated John Chrysostom's homilies.

Life and career Franz Oppenheimer After studying medicine in Freiburg and Berlin, Oppenheimer practiced as a physician in Berlin from 1886 to 1895. From 1890 onwards, he began to concern himself with sociopolitical questions and social economics. After his activity as a physician, he was editor-in-chief of the magazine Welt am Morgen, where he became acquainted with Friedrich Naumann, who was, at the time, working door-to-door for different daily papers. In 1909, Oppenheimer earned a PhD in Kiel with a thesis about economist David Ricardo. From 1909 to 1917, Oppenheimer was a Privatdozent in Berlin, then for two years Titularprofessor. In 1914 he was one of co-founders of the German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews. In 1919, he accepted a call to serve as Chair for Sociology and Theoretical Political Economy at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main. This was the first chair dedicated to Sociology in Germany. A co-operative farm, the so-called \\"Co-operative in Merhavia\\", was founded in 1911 by Jewish immigrants to Ottoman Palestine using a plan for agricultural cooperation written by Oppenheimer. The project eventually failed and Merhavia was transformed in 1922 into a moshav, a different form of communal settlement. From 1934 to 1935, Oppenheimer taught in Palestine. In 1936 he was appointed an honorary member of the American Sociological Association. In 1938, fleeing Nazi persecution, he emigrated via Tokyo and Shanghai to Los Angeles. In 1941 he became a founding member of The American Journal of Economics and Sociology. Oppenheimer's son was Hillel Oppenheimer, a professor of botany at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an Israel Prize recipient. Ideas =Der Staat (The State)= In the 1920s Der Staat was a widely read and heatedly discussed book. It was translated into English, French, Hungarian, Serbian, Japanese, Hebrew, Yiddish and Russian and has been influential among libertarians, communitarians and anarchists.Paul Gottfried, Introduction to Franz Oppenheimer, The State, , 1999, p. viiiAnarcho- Capitalism: An Annotated Bibliography, Hans-Hermann Hoppe Unlike Locke and others, Oppenheimer rejected the idea of the \\"social contract\\" and contributed to the \\"conquest theory of the state\\", heavily influenced by the earlier sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz and his intertribal, intergroup competition, \\"race-conflict\\" (Rassenkampf) theories of the sociological genealogy of the state: Oppenheimer saw the state as the original creator of inequality.Paul Gottfried, Introduction to Franz Oppenheimer, The State, , 1999, p. ix Oppenheimer considered himself a liberal socialist and has been described as pro-market;Richman, Sheldon, Libertarian Left, The American Conservative (March 2011) he thought that nonexploitative economic arrangements would work best in a collectivist environment. He spent much of his life advising people who wished to set up a voluntary, communitarian setting (especially kibbutzim).Paul Gottfried, Introduction to Franz Oppenheimer, The State, , 1999, p. x He rejected the view of anarchists and revolutionary socialists as unnecessarily pessimistic. Not violence, but the path of evolution, would bring about the desired social change. His ideal was a state without class or class interests in which the bureaucracy would become the impartial guardian of the common interests.Paul Gottfried, Introduction to Franz Oppenheimer, The State, , 1999, p. xvii In the United States Oppenheimer became a popularizer and devotee of the American social reformer Henry George. While Oppenheimer and George regarded the state as a longtime protector of privilege, they also believed that it was radically transformed by democracy. Government administrators were forced to show a humanitarian side which made the political class vulnerable. Oppenheimer, who died in 1943, saw Nazism and Bolshevism as representing last-gasp attempts to resurrect ancient tyranny. He hoped that their downfall would provide the prelude to a truly liberal epoch.Paul Gottfried, Introduction to Franz Oppenheimer, The State, , 1999, pp. xii, xiii Oppenheimer was the teacher of German chancellor Ludwig Erhard who rejected his collectivism, but attributed to his professor his own vision of a European society of free and equal men. In 1964 Ludwig Erhard declared that:  Writings  Oppenheimer created an extensive oeuvre of approximately 40 books and 400 essays which contain writings on sociology, economics, and the political questions of his time.

He was a member of the Muhlenberg family political dynasty. Early life and education Shulze was born in Tulpehocken Township in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was the son of Eve Elizabeth (Muhlenberg) and The Rev. Christopher Emmanuel Shulze. Shulze was the grandson of Henry Muhlenberg and the nephew of brothers Peter Muhlenberg and Frederick Muhlenberg, who were leading politicians. Shulze grew up in the Pennsylvania Dutch community speaking their German dialect, and for his entire life would speak English with a noticeable accent. Shulze studied at Franklin College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and was ordained a minister in the Lutheran church in 1796. He left the ministry due to poor health in 1802 and became a merchant in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Shulze married Susan Kimmell and they had five children together. Political career Shulze was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1806 and served three terms. From 1813 to 1821, he served in several low offices in Lebanon County. He served as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 8th district from 1821 to 1823. In 1823, he was elected Governor of Pennsylvania defeating former U.S. Senator Andrew Gregg. He was reelected in 1826 over John Sergeant in one of the most lopsided victories in Pennsylvania political history. Together with Mayor Joseph Watson of Philadelphia, in the mid-1820s Schultze worked to recover young free blacks of a group of about 20 who had been kidnapped from Philadelphia in 1825 and sold into slavery in Mississippi, as well as to prosecute members of the Cannon-Johnson gang of Maryland/Delaware for the crimes. In 1826 he issued extradition notices related to them to the states of Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi. None of the white members were convicted. John Purnell, a mulatto member of the gang, was tried in Philadelphia County Court in 1826, convicted of two counts of kidnapping and sentenced to a fine and 42 years in prison. He died five years later in prison. Patty Cannon, considered the leader of the gang, evaded capture. She was indicted on four counts of murder in 1829 after remains of four blacks were found buried on her land, but she died in jail before being tried, likely a suicide.John Henderson, Joseph Watson, Job Brown, Thomas Bradford Junr., R.

Although it failed to pass during his administration, he laid the groundwork for its adoption and funding under his successor, George Wolf. He also oversaw major canal and road building projects in the state. Later life and legacy Shulze declined to run for a third term and retired to Montoursville, Pennsylvania. He returned to public life briefly to become a delegate to the first national convention of the Whig Party in 1839.

Bruce FranklinNote: 'H' for Howard) (born February 1934), is an American cultural historian and scholar. He is notable for receiving top awards for his lifetime scholarship in fields as diverse as American studies, science fiction, prison literature and marine ecology. He has written or edited nineteen booksNote: many of his works have been translated into German, French, Spanish, Korean, Taiwanese, Vietnamese and others and three hundred professional articles and participated in making four films. His main areas of academic focus are science fiction, prison literature, environmentalism, the Vietnam War and its aftermath, and American cultural history. He was instrumental in helping to debunk false public speculation that Vietnam was continuing to hold prisoners of war. He helped to establish science fiction writing as a genre worthy of serious academic study. In 2008, the American Studies Association awarded him the Pearson-Bode Prize for Lifetime Achievement in American Studies.American Studies Association (ASA) 2016, Bode- Pearson Prize Recipients, 1975-2015, Retrieved February 9, 2016, \\"...2008: H. Bruce Franklin, Rutgers University, Newark...\\" A critic of the Vietnam War, he was fired from Stanford in 1972 for allegedly inciting to riot, and the termination brought nationwide attention to the issue of academic freedom. Since 1975, he is the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. Early years Born in February 1934, Franklin held numerous jobs in Brooklyn while working his way through college. From 1951 to 1952, he was a batch worker at the Mayfair Photofinishing Company. In 1953, he was an upholsterer for the Carb Manufacturing Company, and was later promoted to foreman of the shipping department in 1954. He graduated from Amherst in 1955. In 1956, he married Jane Morgan with whom he has had three children. From 1955 to 1956, he was a tugboat deckhand and mate for the Pennsylvania RR Marine department, based in Jersey City, New Jersey. He served in the United States Air Force from 1956 to 1959 as a navigator and intelligence officer. In 1966, he resigned his commission in the Strategic Air Command as a protest against the Vietnam War. Stanford years Franklin got his doctorate from Stanford in 1961 and was hired at the university as an assistant professor of English in 1961, and was promoted to associate professor in 1965.Rutgers University, Faculty biography, Retrieved February 10, 2016 He was also a lecturer in San Jose, California's municipal adult education department from 1963 to 1964. He became an expert on American writers, particularly Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne. At one point, he served as president of the Melville Society. His first book, The Wake of the Gods: Melville's Mythology examined Melville's use of mythologies and intellectual milieu from Meso-American to Sanskrit. Franklin wrote a scholarly edition of Melville's The Confidence Man: His Masquerade, which traced obscure classical and \\"alien\\" references embedded in Melville's prose. Franklin and his family spent a year in France from 1966 to 1967. He taught for six months at Stanford's campus in Tours, and then moved in Paris. There he and his wife Jane studied Marxist theory, helped organize the Free University of Paris, and participated in setting up the European network of GI deserters. Jones, Clarence B. What Would Martin Say? (Harper Perennial, 2009), p. 209. When he returned to the United States in the late 1960s, he became a prominent activist in the movement against the Vietnam War. =Maoism, Revolutionary Union, and Venceremos= In 1968, Franklin was one of twenty- four founders of the Revolutionary Union. After Franklin left the RU, the organization became the Revolutionary Communist Party. The organization was infiltrated by the FBI which planted informers within the leadership of the group to heighten members' \\"suspicions of each other\\" (although the extent of FBI activity in RU during the brief time Franklin was a member has not been established). Detailed information about this period and the FBI's attempts to \\"neutralize\\" (their word) Franklin can be found in the thousands of FOIA pages he has donated to the Bancroft Library of the University of California in Berkeley. Doctrinal differences soon emerged between followers of Franklin and followers of Robert Avakian over revolutionary strategy. In a matter of months Franklin, along with roughly half of RU's members, left to join a Chicano-based leftist group called [Venceremos =Termination from Stanford= At Stanford, in 1971, Franklin was accused of inciting anti-war protests on campus. At a campus rally on February 10, Franklin made a speech protesting a war effort by the United States during the Vietnam War to invade the neighboring nation of Laos. According to the testimony of one witness, Franklin urged students assembled at the rally to disrupt university functions by shutting down its computer facility. Franklin concluded his speech at that rally by saying: > See, now what we're asking is for people to make that little tiny gesture to > show that we're willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin > to shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is a > good target, that Computation Center.Franklin v. Atkins, 409 F. Supp. 439, > 443 (1976), available at Justia.com A report in the Stanford Daily student publication suggested that Franklin urged protestors to \\"resist police efforts\\" with the effect of \\"inciting a riot.\\" After his speech, students occupied the Stanford computer center and more than 100 riot police were summoned. Stanford president Richard Lyman gave Franklin a letter, claiming that he violated an agreement entitled \\"Statement of Policy on Appointments and Tenure\\", with the specific complaint that Franklin \\"deliberately contributed to a disturbance which forced the cancellation of a speech by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge at Dinkelspiel Auditorium\\". A tenure-review committee was chosen, with professors from assorted academic departments. A lecture hall was converted into a makeshift courtroom. Stanford hired a major Los Angeles law firm, with lead attorney Paul Valentine, to argue the university's case, while Franklin, lacking funds from being unemployed, had to defend himself with advice from a law student. Evidence was heard, witnesses were cross-examined, summations were given, and the panel left to consider its verdict. Franklin was found guilty of three charges of \\"inciting student disruptions\\". Accordingly, Stanford fired Franklin in 1972. He was the only tenured professor to be fired from Stanford. The termination generated nationwide media exposure and brought attention to the issue of academic freedom and freedom of speech. Afterwards, Franklin was out of work for the next three years. Blacklisted, Franklin did not have regular employment during these years, although he had brief visiting faculty positions at Wesleyan and Yale from 1974 to 1975. A decade later, in 1985, with the help of a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union, Franklin appealed the termination, and sought back pay, damages, and reinstatement, but the effort was not successful. A state court upheld Stanford's ruling, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear the case. ACLU lawyer Margaret Casey said the ruling would have a \\"chilling effect\\" on the power of academics to express their thinking freely. Rutgers years In 1975 Franklin was hired by Rutgers as a full professor with tenure. Since 1987 he is the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies (emeritus since his retirement in 2016).from the Rutgers website Franklin's academic career has diverse areas of scrutiny which mostly relate to the topic of American cultural history. In 2014, he was influential in organizing Rutgers faculty to block the choice of Condoleezza Rice as commencement speaker. In 2014, Temple University scholar Carolyn Karcher summed up Franklin's achievements by saying that he has an \\"extraordinary gift for teaching us to read our history in our literature and to glean from both insights that can help us alter our future.\\" =Science fiction= Franklin has a lifelong passion for science fiction and has been a guest curator on topics about Star Trek and Star Wars. His book War Stars was cited by leftist philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky, who bemoaned the prevalence of a recurring theme in popular literature that \\"we're about to face destruction from some terrible, awesome enemy.\\" Franklin's research explored America's fascination with superweapons. He argued in War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination that popular American books and novels in preceding decades and centuries, which dealt with the themes of superweapons, may have helped to shape national thinking on this subject. When the movie Independence Day appeared in 1996, Franklin said \\"Fundamental to the historical experience of [American] culture are alien invaders who came armed with a superior technology and wiped out the culture that was here.\\" His book Future Perfect: American Science Fiction of the Nineteenth Century (1966) identified American authors including Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville as pioneers of this genre who wrote science fiction, contrary to popular understanding. His Robert A. Heinlein: America as Science Fiction won the Eaton Award in 1981, and contributed to Franklin receiving the Pilgrim Award for lifetime scholarship in 1983. In his 1988 War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination,selected by Choice as the Outstanding Academic Book of 1989, Franklin turned his interest in science fiction to an examination of the American fascination with superweapons. His book presents a view that, ironically, from Robert Fulton's submarine Nautilus in the 18th century to the death-dealing weaponry of the late 20th century, superweapons ostensibly designed to end war have proved capable of exterminating the human species. The expanded 2008 edition explores how this cultural history led to the seemingly permanent state of warfare of the 21st century. War Stars is informed by Franklin's own earlier experience as a navigator and intelligence officer in the Strategic Air Command. In 1990 he was named the Distinguished Scholar for the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts.Rutgers University, 2016, FACULTY BIOGRAPHY, Retrieved February 10, 2016, \\"... in 1990 he was named the Distinguished Scholar of the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts...\\" In 1991, he was Guest Curator for the Star Trek and the Sixties exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution; this show subsequently traveled to the Hayden Planetarium. =Vietnam and its aftermath= A recurring subject area for Franklin is the history of the Vietnam War and its role in American literature and culture since 1966. His books M.I.A., or Mythmaking in America and Vietnam and America: A Documented History (which he co-edited) have been used in courses on the Vietnam War. His Vietnam and Other American Fantasies (2000) synthesized his previous work and extended it into an overview of 21st-century American culture. One of Franklin's themes in writing about Vietnam is that the supposed existence of surviving American prisoners of war in Vietnam after the war was a myth created after 1980 with the tacit approval of the Reagan administration, and that the psychological foundations of the myth arguably originated from justifications for the war offered by the Nixon before 1973, in that the war had to continue in order to bring the prisoners of war home. In the 1980s and 1990s, many Americans believed, incorrectly, that there were many \\"prisoners of war are still being held in Indochina\\" and that the American government was lying to the public about their existence. When Franklin was assembling an anthology in 1996 entitled The Vietnam War in American Stories, Songs and Poems, he sent a fax to musician Bruce Springsteen requesting the singer's permission to put the song Born in the U.S.A. in his anthology; he faxed the request en route to class, and Springsteen's office faxed back, agreeing, letting him use the image without charge. His book Vietnam and America: A Documented History, which he co-edited with his wife Jane Franklin and Marvin Gettleman and Marilyn Young, was described by The New York Times as a \\"valuable anthology of crucial texts and records\\" which \\"tersely replays the bitter conflict.\\" A reviewer in The Nation described Franklin's writing about the M.I.A. issue as using \\"elegant economy\\". Franklin believed that his students had incorrect ideas about the American involvement in Vietnam, such as that the United States lost the war because it \\"didn't try hard enough\\"; Franklin felt that his students were unaware of the extent of bomb damage. His book chronicled how the supposed \\"missing\\" American soldiers were \\"known to be dead\\" but were \\"kept alive for bureaucratic reasons that backfired.\\" He described the post-war belief in still-held prisoners of war as a \\"manufactured issue\\" and criticized presidential contender Michele Bachmann for bringing up the issue as \\"pure opportunism.\\" Franklin was pivotal in helping to debunk the \\"Missing in Action\\" myths. New York Times reviewer Todd Gitlin described Franklin's M.I.A. as \\"meticulously researched.\\" In 2018, at the age of 85, Franklin published Crash Course: From the Good War to the Forever War, a history of America from the 1930s to the present, in the form of a memoir. The book takes us from the consciousness of a kid growing up during World War II, through his work as a tugboat mate on the New York waterfront during the murderous gang wars, his experience at a Strategic Air Command navigator and intelligence officer, and his subsequent decades of activism for peace and justice. =Environmentalism= Franklin's research about menhaden, a fish crucial in the food chain of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, helped spark a mass movement to protect them. In The Most Important Fish in the Sea, Franklin examined marine food chains and argued for the importance of menhaden. He showed that many species of fish, which humans eat, depend for their well-being on eating menhaden, and therefore their role in the food chain was vital. Franklin's analysis was an interdisciplinary study in American environmental, economic, social, political, and cultural history from the 17th into the 21st centuries. It led to the introduction of two nature conservation bills in Congress. In a review in The Washington Post, his book was described as an \\"exhaustive examination of issues\\" using lucid prose \\"infused with an urgency that depends little on hyperbole and largely on careful documentation\\". The book played a leading role in persuading the Department of Commerce in 2020 to act to protect menhaden. =Prisoners and prisons= A major focus of Franklin's research has been the American penal system. Prison Literature in America (1989) established Franklin as an authority on American prison literature and has been cited by historians, penologists, literary critics, and sociologists. In books such as his 1998 anthology Prison Writing in 20th-Century America and Prison Literature in America, Franklin argued that convict authors and artists are \\"innovative creators who have had a deep influence on the mainstream of cultural production\\", according to the Los Angeles Times. His work was cited in the Supreme Court's decision to overturn New York State's Son of Sam law. He has been an outspoken critic of the American penal system, in terms of violations of human rights. His anthology Prison Writing in 20th-Century America about \\"criminals turned raconteurs\\" was well received.

Built between 1886 and 1890, the capitol is located in Cheyenne and contains the chambers of the Wyoming State Legislature as well as the office of the Governor of Wyoming. It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987.As \\"Wyoming State Capitol and Grounds\\" or alternate name \\"Wyoming Capitol Building and Grounds\\", the property was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places during 1973. It was further designated a National Historic Landmark during 1987. The Capitol underwent an extensive three-year renovation and reopened to the public on July 10, 2019.{{Cite newsid=title=Paintings on historic vaults uncovered at Wyoming State Capitollast=EverGreene Architectural Arts Incfirst=date=Jun 26, 2019work=Wyoming Tribune - Eagle; Cheyenne, Wyo.} History The construction of the capitol began prior to Wyoming gaining statehood. Cheyenne was born in 1867 in the path of the transcontinental railroad, when the Union Pacific crews arrived to lay tracks westward. Cheyenne soon laid claim to a higher status than older Wyoming settlements such as those at Fort Laramie, Fort Bridger, and the mining town of South Pass City, changing Cheyenne from a village to a city in a matter of months. The seat of the new Territorial government was established in Cheyenne in 1869. In 1886, the Ninth Territorial Legislative Assembly authorized construction of the State Capitol. A five- member commission, appointed by Governor Francis E. Warren, was charged with the selection and purchase of the site, selection of an architect and accepting the lowest bids for construction of the building. The commission chose the firm of David W. Gibbs & Company, Architects, to draw plans and specifications. These were accepted in July 1886 and a contract issued to the lowest bidder, Adam Feick & Brothers, who broke ground on September 9, 1886. The Tenth Territorial Legislative Assembly convened in the unfinished building. The two small wings on the east and west were completed in 1890. Crowded conditions persisted with the growth of the state and in 1915 the Thirteenth legislature approved the construction of the House and Senate Chambers, which were completed in March 1917. The 42nd Legislature in 1974 appropriated funds for the first phase of renovation of the capitol and the project was completed in 1980. Work included stripping and staining all woodwork, painting walls in the original designs and colors, replacing wooden floor beams with steel, concrete and modernizing the wiring, heating, plumbing and air conditioning. In 2013, the Wyoming State Legislature created a task force to examine potential renovations to the building. The Legislature authorized the renovation project in 2014 with work on the Capitol, the Herschler Building, the utility plant and the tunnels to be completed as a unified project with a budget of $299 million. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2019. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, for its role in Wyoming's history, including specifically the role it played in hosting conventions that ensured woman's suffrage in the state constitution. Description The facade as it was extended during 1915 with the House and Senate chambers in the end pavilions The capitol is located north of downtown Cheyenne. The exterior approach to the front steps of the capitol features the State Seal in granite. The architecture of the building is Renaissance Revival, reminiscent of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The sandstone for the building came from quarries in Rawlins, Wyoming, and Fort Collins, Colorado. The building's cornerstone was laid on May 18, 1887, with maps, a roster of territorial officers, and other papers inside. During the Centennial of the Capitol in 1987; the cornerstone was removed, these documents were replaced and the cornerstone reset. While standing in the center of the rotunda, looking up at the base of the dome directly overhead you see the stained glass, imported from England. From underneath it sparkles with blue, purple, and green hues, but the upper side glistens with red, yellow, and orange. The peak of the dome is 146 feet high, and the base is 50 feet in diameter. The first-floor rotunda is striking, with checkerboard marble floors, columns, and an impressive staircase made of cherry wood brought out from Ohio. The Governor is the only elected official with offices in the capitol the four other elected officials, have a ceremonial office only. The Senate chamber is in the west wing of the second- floor building; the House chamber is in the east wing of the second floor. Each chamber contains four large murals by Allen Tupper True, who painted them in August 1917 for a cost of $500 each. The murals depict various aspects of the culture, history, and industry of Wyoming. The murals in the Senate chamber are entitled Indian Chief Cheyenne, Frontier Cavalry Officer, Pony Express Rider, and Railroad Builders/Surveyors. The House murals are entitled Cattlemen, Trappers, Homesteaders, and Stagecoach. The ceilings of both chambers are inlaid with stained glass from the Midland Paint and Glass Company of Omaha, NE, with the Wyoming State Seal displayed in the center. Both chambers are accessible to visitors by balconies on the third floor. The House has two oil paintings by William Gollings. The wood in both chambers is oak.  Renovation  The Wyoming State Capitol went through a major restoration between 2016 and 2019. Many improvements were made during this time. Some of the improvements included: the addition of stairs, elevators, and restrooms; the restoration of decorative paintings and moldings; and the improvement of the electrical and HVAC systems. During the restoration phase, there were several discoveries of paintings, decorated architectural elements, and woodwork that were all carefully restored. Another major part of the restoration project was to gain back some of the visibility of the dome on the building. To be able to view the dome from North Capitol Avenue, a large atrium on an adjacent building was demolished. = The Dome = The dome is one of the key architectural features of the Capitol building. It stands out above the skyline, representing Wyoming's values. The Dome of the capitol is copper and it tarnished so badly in 1900 they began using gold leaf on the exterior of the dome. The 24-carat gold leaf dome is visible from all roads entering the city. It has been gilded five times, the first in 1900. Only ten out of the fifty United States have gold leaf covered domes on their state capitol buildings. In 2009, the dome was re-covered in gold for $1.3 million. During the restoration process that took place between 2016 and 2019, scaffolding was used to cover the dome until the work on it was complete. Thanks to this restoration work, the dome's life expectancy went from a mere 15 years to 90 years. = The Vaults = On the first floor of the Capitol, there sits six vaults that were covered in brown paint. But during the restoration, this paint was removed, and hiding beneath it were unique paintings, one for each vault door. These vaults were found to have been made by Mosler Safe and Lock Company, which was a well distinguished safe company at the time. This company was originally called Mosler, Bahmann and Company and was located in Cincinnati,Ohio. Mosler's sons would later take over the business and move it to Hamilton, Ohio, where it would be run under the name Mosler Safe and Lock Company.

He was arrested by the FBI in New York City in 1983 following information obtained from a Soviet defector. He was convicted of high treason as a spy for the Soviets for a period of twenty years in South Africa together with his second wife, Ruth, who had acted as his courier. Both were released prior to the change of government following the 1994 general election. Early life, education and military training Born 1 November 1935, Gerhardt joined the South African Navy after his father successfully persuaded naval chief Hugo Biermann to take the troubled teenager under his wing to try to instill discipline in him; he graduated from the Naval Academy in Saldanha Bay in 1956, winning the Sword of Honour. In 1962 he attended a Royal Navy mine school in Portsmouth and completed the parachute training course at RAF Abingdon. After his training in Britain, he was seconded to the Royal Navy. He started his spying career in his late twenties, while still a junior naval officer, by offering his services to the South African Communist Party. Bram Fischer referred him to the Soviet embassy in London, where the \\"walk-in\\" was recruited into the GRU, the Soviet military intelligence branch, and instructed to continue his career in the South African military. Spy activities As part of his service in the Royal Navy, he trained at and served on , and passed classified information about the weapons systems there to the Soviets. Among the systems he compromised through these activities were the SeaCat and Sea Sparrow missiles. He was also responsible for passing the first intelligence information about the French Exocet missile to the Soviets. British journalist and security services specialist Chapman Pincher maintained that, while in London in the late 1960s, Gerhardt was able to interview Royal Navy Polaris submarine crews for potential candidates that the Soviets could approach. It was also during this time that he met his first wife, British- born Janet Coggin whom he married in 1958. Coggin says she became aware of her husband's Cold War spying activities eight years later in 1966, but chose not to turn him in, fearing that he would be executed, leaving her children fatherless. She says Gerhardt eventually gave her an ultimatum to become a spy too, which she declined, forcing the couple's separation. She divorced him in 1966 and moved to Ireland with her children, claiming that she lived in constant fear of the Soviet security services. She subsequently published a book in 1999 about her experiences called The Spy's Wife. In 1973 Gerhardt married his second wife, Ruth Johr, a Swiss citizen who author Chapman Pincher claims was already a spy for the German Democratic Republic. According to Gerhardt, he recruited her shortly after they were married. She travelled to Moscow to undergo training. Simon's Town naval base in 2006 Gerhardt rose through the ranks of the naval establishment as his career progressed. Upon his return from training in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, he served as the naval liaison officer with the defence company that subsequently become Armscor. From 1972‚Äì1978, he was appointed as a senior staff officer to the Chief of the SADF in Pretoria. In this position he was able to access South African Army and Air Force secrets and plans regarding the South African Border War. He claims direct involvement in aspects of Israeli and South Africa's military cooperation, using this position in 1975 to pass Israeli secrets to the Soviets, including details of the purchase of Jericho missiles from Israel. Later, he was appointed commander of the strategically important Simonstown naval dockyard. In this position, he had access to all the South African Naval intelligence reports from the Silvermine listening post near Cape Town, as well as technical details of weapons systems. He reportedly revealed to the Soviets most of the Western naval surveillance techniques for the South Atlantic. During the 1982 Falklands War, Gerhardt was allegedly able to use his position to supply the Soviets with detailed information about the locations of Royal Navy ships in the south Atlantic that the South African Navy intercepted at Silvermine. Admiral of the Fleet Lord Hill-Norton publicly contradicted this view, but supported screening of Royal Navy officers who had been in contact with Gerhardt throughout his career. Gerhardt visited the USSR five times during his career, while his wife travelled with him twice in 1972 and 1976. He was reportedly paid 800,000 Swiss francs by the GRU for his spying activities; his contact in the GRU said that money was not the motive for Gerhardt. Arrest, trial and subsequent release Gerhardt's cover was finally blown by Soviet double agent Vladimir Vetrov (given the codename \\"Farewell\\" by France's DST intelligence service) He was arrested at his hotel in New York City in January 1983 in a sting operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation while he was taking a degree in mathematics at Syracuse University. The CIA interrogated him for 11 days, during which time he gave up one of his Soviet handlers, Vitaly Shlykov (codename \\"Bob\\"). Shlykov, who did not know that the Gerhardts had been arrested, was also arrested on 25 January when he travelled to Zurich under the alias \\"Mikhail Nikolayev\\" for a pre- arranged meeting with Ruth Gerhardt. He had in his possession $100,000 in cash that he intended to pay her; he did not disclose his real identity to Swiss authorities, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment for spying. P.W. Botha announced Gerhardt's arrest to the world in a special press conference on 26 January 1983. Following his deportation to South Africa, Gerhardt and his wife were tried in camera in the Cape Town Supreme Court, with the prospect of a death sentence being handed down for high treason. In his trial, Gerhardt stated that the repulsion he felt towards his father's right-wing political beliefs drove him to fight apartheid by serving the USSR. According to Gerhardt, he deliberately attempted to sow confusion in the trial by stating in his defence that he had spied for an unnamed third country that was not hostile to South Africa. His first wife described him as a \\"traditional apartheid-accepting South African\\"; he had told her that he wanted revenge against the South African government for interning his father, a Nazi sympathizer, during World War II. Ruth Gerhardt claimed in her defence that she thought he was a double agent working for South Africa. Judge George Munnik sentenced him to life imprisonment in December 1983, while his wife Ruth received a 10-year sentence for acting as a courier. The judge said that he would have passed the death sentence on Gerhardt that the prosecution sought if the information he had passed to the Soviet Union had led to the death of a South African soldier. Ruth Gerhardt served her sentence together with Barbara Hogan and other anti-apartheid dissidents. In 1988, she attempted to gain her freedom by renouncing violence, and thereby take advantage of an offer made by PW Botha to political prisoners like Nelson Mandela, however the request was turned down by Justice Goldstone. Dieter Gerhardt was one of the imprisoned spies who was mooted for inclusion in a 1989 East-West prisoner exchange amongst a number of countries that did not materialise. In 1990 when FW de Klerk unbanned organisations such as the ANC and released political prisoners like Nelson Mandela, Gerhardt was not one of those who was freed. He was visited in prison on 22 January 1992 by a delegation from the ANC, who were seeking information regarding the SADF that might have assisted them in CODESA negotiations with the National Party government. Gerhardt was released in August 1992 following his application for release, political pressure in South Africa and an appeal by Russian premier Boris Yeltsin to South African President FW de Klerk when the latter visited Moscow after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Former Minister of Defence Magnus Malan said that the former spy's release was a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic ties and the signing of a trade agreement between South Africa and the Russian Federation. Gerhardt moved to Basel, Switzerland, following in the footsteps of his Swiss wife Ruth Gerhardt, who was released in 1990 following a request from the Swiss government. He stated upon his release that: \\"I did not feel like a traitor or someone who was betraying his colleagues. I was a political activist fighting the evil regime of apartheid. It was nothing personal.\\" Gerhardt was subsequently granted amnesty in 1999 by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and his rank of rear admiral restored. Nuclear weapons controversy Pelindaba He claimed that the United States and the Soviet Union met in 1978 to discuss South Africa's nuclear weapons programme, and that the Soviets proposed a pre-emptive strike on the Pelindaba plant. In February 1994, he told Des Blow of the Johannesburg City Press that the Vela Incident was the result of a joint Israeli-South African nuclear test, code- named Operation Phoenix. He stated that he had no official knowledge of the alleged test, but was not ready to provide further details. In a subsequent interview with David Albright in March 1994, he stated that no South African warships had been involved, but declined to provide further details. Popular Mechanics contends that the mystery surrounding the incident would finally have been resolved if Gerhardt were a more credible source, while other authors suggest that newly declassified documents increase the credibility of his claims.

History Development of the R-4 began in 1959, initially designated as K-80 or R-80, entering operational service around 1963, together with Tu-128. Like many Soviet weapons, it was made in both semi-active radar homing (R-4R) and infrared-homing (R-4T) versions. Standard Soviet doctrine was to fire the weapons in SARH/IR pairs to increase the odds of a hit. Target altitude was from 8 to 21 km. Importantly for the slow-climbing Tu-128, the missile could be fired even from 8 km below the target. In 1973 the weapon was modernized to R-4MR (SARH) / MT (IR) standard, with lower minimal target altitude (0.5‚Äì1 km),https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-super-sized- tu-128-fighter-the-supersonic-b-52-19972 improved seeker performance, and compatibility with the upgraded RP-SM Smerch-M radar.

The novel is commended by many for its vivid portrayal of tumultuous life in Bombay. The novel is reportedly influenced by real events in the life of the author, though some claims made by Roberts are contested by others involved in the story. Plot summary In 1978, Roberts was sentenced to a 19-year imprisonment in Australia after being convicted of a series of armed robberies of building society branches, credit unions, and shops. In July 1980, he escaped from Victoria's Pentridge Prison in broad daylight, thereby becoming one of Australia's most wanted men for the next ten years. The protagonist Lindsay (according to the book, Roberts' fake name) arrives in Bombay carrying a false passport in the name of Lindsay Ford. Mumbai was supposed to be only a stopover on a journey that was to take him from New Zealand to Germany, but he decides to stay in the city. Lindsay soon meets a local man named Prabaker whom he hires as a guide. Prabaker soon becomes his friend and names him Lin (Linbaba). Both men visit Prabaker's native village, Sunder, where Prabaker's mother decided to give Lin a new Maharashtrian name, like her own. Because she judged his nature to be blessed with peaceful happiness, she decided to call him Shantaram, meaning Man of God's Peace. On their way back to Mumbai, Lin and Prabaker are robbed. With all his possessions gone, Lin is forced to live in the slums, which shelters him from the authorities. After a massive fire on the day of his arrival in the slum, he sets up a free health clinic as a way to contribute to the community. He learns about the local culture and customs in this crammed environment, gets to know and love the people he encounters, and even becomes fluent in Marathi, the local language. He also witnesses and battles outbreaks of cholera and firestorms, becomes involved in trading with the lepers, and experiences how ethnic and marital conflicts are resolved in this densely crowded and diverse community. The novel describes a number of foreigners of various origins, as well as local Indians, highlighting the rich diversity of life in Mumbai. Lin falls in love with Karla, a Swiss-American woman, befriends local artists and actors, landing him roles as an extra in several Bollywood movies, and is recruited by the Mumbai underworld for various criminal operations, including drug and weapons trade. Lin eventually lands in Mumbai's Arthur Road Prison. There, along with hundreds of other inmates, he endures brutal physical and mental abuse from the guards, while existing under extremely squalid conditions. However, thanks to the protection of the Afghan mafia don \\"Abdel Khader Khan\\", Lin is eventually released, and begins to work in a black market currency exchange and passport forgery. Having traveled as far as Africa on trips commissioned by the mafia, Lin later goes to Afghanistan to smuggle weapons for mujahideen freedom fighters. When his mentor Khan is killed, Lin realizes he has become everything he grew to loathe and falls into depression after he returns to India. He decides that he must fight for what he believes is right, and build an honest life. The story ends with him planning to go to Sri Lanka, which lays the premise for the sequel to this book. = Fact-based elements = While parts of the novel, based on Roberts' known biography, such as Roberts' criminal history and escape from prison in Australia, are a matter of public record, and read as reportedly factual, numerous significant claims by Roberts remain harder (or impossible) to verify and are disputed by the family of one of the main Indian characters in the book. There is a great deal of debate as to where the boundaries lie between fact and fiction in the book. Roberts has stated the characters in the story are largely invented, and that he merged different elements taken from true events and people into such events and characters like Prabaker 'of the big smile'. Prabhakar Kisan Khare was a real-life individual, as are the members of Khare family from the book (Kisan, Rukhma, Kishor and Parvati Khare) whose names appear on government issued identity cards. The family resides in the Navy Nagar slum where the lead character Shantaram also lived. The Khare family disputes many of Roberts' claims, although they acknowledge close association with Gregory Roberts in the 1980s. Prabhakar died in an accident in 1988 in circumstances matching the event in the book. In March 2006, the Mumbai Mirror reported they may have discovered the inspiration for the big smile of the character Prabhakar as belonging to a still living cab driver called Kishore, who took Roberts to his home village.Mumbai Mirror Kishore Khare, brother of Prabhakar, who drives tourists around Mumbai, has told his story.  Roberts' position, based on his interviews  \\"With respect, Shantaram is not an autobiography, it‚Äôs a novel. If the book reads like an autobiography, I take that as a very high compliment, because I structured the created narrative to read like fiction but feel like fact. I wanted the novel to have the page-turning drive of a work of fiction but to be informed by such a powerful stream of real experience that it had the authentic feel of fact.\\" \\"As with the novel Shantaram, the experiences in The Mountain Shadow are derived from my own real experiences, and the characters, dialogue, and narrative structure are all created.\\" Roberts repeatedly stated this, as on the book's official website:  Characters   Publication history  Originally, Shantaram was published by Scribe Publications as a hardcover and later as a paperback. Following the mediated resolution in 2004 of a dispute that arose in 2003 between Scribe and the book's author, Gregory David Roberts, rights to all forms of the local publication of Shantaram reverted to the author after Scribe sold its remaining stock of hardbacks.Scribe Hardback - Out of Print Pan Macmillan then took over publication under the Picador label.Picador Edition - Softcover  Sequels  Gregory Roberts has said that Shantaram is the first book in a planned quartet. A sequel entitled The Mountain Shadow was released on 13 October 2015 by Little Brown. In this long- awaited sequel, Lin strives to survive in the new Bombay run by the new mafia. Movie adaptation When the novel Shantaram was published in 2003, several parties, including actor Russell Crowe, expressed interest in a film adaptation. Although Crowe was temporarily attached to a bid, Warner Bros. went forward with a $2 million bid primarily due to actor Johnny Depp's expression of love for the book to studio executive Brad Grey. With the rights won, Depp was attached to star in the film, which was to be based on a script written by the book's author Gregory David Roberts. Roberts commended the casting choice, and the author said of his intended script, \\"The screenplay I am writing will be as complex and will have the same sense of layering and texturing. Thematically, it will reflect everything that is in the heart of the book and that is the exile experience, and the power of love to transform and change the heart of a person. But the book is a book and the film is a film‚Äîthey are different art forms so the film will have an independent life.\\" In October 2005, Warner Bros. hired screenwriter Eric Roth to rewrite the initial draft created by Roberts. The following November, director Peter Weir was hired by the studio to helm Shantaram and develop the script with Roth. The studio originally planned to schedule production for late 2006. By June 2006, Weir departed from the project with a studio spokesperson citing different interpretations between the director and the studio and producers. In January 2007, director Mira Nair replaced Weir at the helm. The studio anticipated production would begin by autumn 2007 for a 2008 release. Roth began rewriting the script to lower project costs, and actor Amitabh Bachchan joined to star opposite Depp. By November 2007, the anticipated February production start was cancelled by Warner Bros, who cited the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike's interference with the script's readiness, the impending monsoon season in India, and Depp's schedule difficulties in filming between India and New Mexico in the United States. The studio anticipated that production would finally begin in September 2008, but by November 2009, with production not starting, The Independent reported the project had been cancelled. In May 2013, the Mumbai Mirror reported that Warner Bros. had negotiated to retain the film rights until 2015, fuelling speculation that a film adaptation of Shantaram was still in the works. In the following October, it was announced that Joel Edgerton would be starring in the leading role, with Eric Roth penning the adaptation and Johnny Depp now involved as a producer. Warner Bros. was in early talks with Garth Davis, co-director of the Emmy-nominated Top of the Lake, to make his feature film directing debut on the movie. TV adaptation On June 7, 2018, it was announced that Apple Inc. was developing a television adaptation of the novel for Apple TV+ to be written by Eric Warren Singer who will also executive produce alongside David Manson, Nicole Clemens, Steve Golin, and Andrea Barron. Production companies set to be involved with the potential series include Anonymous Content and Paramount Television. In August 2019, it was announced that production was moving forward with filming set to begin in October 2019. The series will be filmed in Victoria, Australia with scenes filmed at Docklands Studios Melbourne and HM Prison Pentridge. It was also announced that the series will get 7.4 million Australian dollars in funding from the Australian Government. The series is set to consist of 10 episodes with four episodes to be directed by Justin Kurzel.

History In 1980, Cory Robbins, who was 23 at the time and had worked briefly for MCA, wanted to start a record label. He invited his songwriter friend Steve Plotnicki to be a partner. They each borrowed $17,000 from their parents, purchased the little used Panorama Records subsidiary from MCA, and Profile Records was born. Their tiny office opened at 250 West 57th street in NYC on May 1, 1981. Contrary to the Urban myth that has existed for decades, Robbins and Plotnicki did not buy Profile Records from MCA Records, nor was it the child of any other label. The label started as and remained an independent company created by Robbins and Plotnicki. With the success of ‚ÄúGenius Rap‚Äù by Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde, they escaped financial ruin by a mere $2,000. From there it was Gidea Park's ‚ÄúSeasons of Gold‚Äù that brought more commercial and financial success, becoming Profile Records‚Äô first hit to make the Billboard Hot 100. In 1982 the fledgling label gained international recognition with the club hit \\"I Specialize in Love\\", recorded by Sharon Brown,Whitburn, Joel (2004). Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003, (Record Research Inc.), page 46. licensed to Virgin Records in the U.K. The label continued its commercial success, with gold and platinum sales with artists such as Dana Dane, Twin Hype, Run DMC, Poor Righteous Teachers, Nemesis, and Paul Hardcastle to name a few. In 1985, the label moved to a headquarters at 740 Broadway in New York. The label had numerous sub-labels such as Smile Communications (which later became independent and continued to be controlled by Plotnicki after Profile was acquired), Sea Bright Records, and Robert Hill's Zakia Records, the label that launched the career of King Sun and hip hop legends Eric B. & Rakim. Profile's biggest act was Run-D.M.C., which was introduced to Robbins when manager Russell Simmons sent him a demo cassette of \\"It's Like That\\". Robbins signed the group soon after. The partners' less than amicable split severed not only all business ties but all personal ones too.

The Takara motto was ÈÅä„Å≥„ÅØÊñáÂåñ„Äç(\\"playing is culture\\"). Products =Toys= In 1967, Takara produced the first generation of the Licca-chan doll, which was 21 centimeters tall and had the last name of Kayama, inspired by the musician Yuzo Kayama and actress Yoshiko Kayama. In 1975, Takara produced the Diaclone and Microman Micro Change toys. In 1984, the toy line was rebranded by Hasbro as \\"Transformers\\", which made Takara waste no time joining in. Takara continued to sell Microman and used it as the basis for the Micronauts toy line. Micronauts were sold internationally by the Mego Corporation. Other transforming toys made by Takara include Brave, Denn≈ç B≈çkenki Webdiver, and Daigunder. Both Webdiver and Daigunder toys could interact with TV screens, which proved only but a fad in the early 2000s. Takara also invented Battle Beasts, the E-kara karaoke microphone, B-Daman and Beyblade. These toys were sold or distributed internationally by Hasbro. In 1978, Takara developed the Choro-Q, mini pullback cars. Internationally, they have been sold as \\"Penny Racers\\". =Software= Takara developed and published video games. In the 1990s, Takara published the Chibi Maruko-chan video games. The company ported (adapted) some of the SNK Neo Geo based arcade games for 8 and 16-bit consoles. These included the Fatal Fury and the Samurai Shodown series. They were sold for use with the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Game Boy, or the Famicom. In 2003, Takara contributed to the production of the game, Seek-and-Destroy. Takara published the 3D computer graphics fighting game series Battle Arena Toshinden, developed by Tamsoft. Small games developers such as Tamsoft, BHE, E-game and KID corp, were sometimes omitted from the credits on a game's Takara packaging or title screens. Also that year, Takara purchased a controlling stake in the publicly traded software publisher Atlus. Some Takara properties were licensed to and published by Atlus. In 2006, after the merger with Tomy, the controlling stake in Atlus was sold to Index Holdings, Takara Tomy's major shareholder. Takara- branded product licenses such as Licca-chan, Jinsei Game, The Game of Life and Choro-Q were returned to Takara Tomy's consumer software division. The merged company also produced the Zoids and the Naruto series. =Life entertainment products= Takara has manufactured several unusual gadgets marketed as \\"life entertainment products\\". An example is BowLingual which aimed to translate the sounds of dogs to human language. The BowLingual was named as one of the best inventions of 2002 by Time magazine.

Company mascot In the 1980s, the company was criticized for using a mascot that was a golliwog-like character. The mascot was named \\"Dakko-Chan\\" („ÉÄ„ÉÉ„Ç≥„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì). Takara replaced the mascot with \\"21st Century Colorful Dakko-Chan\\", which had enough features to connote the original mascot but divested the traits which brought criticism. For example, the new mascot was not always coloured black. Merger On 13 May 2005, Takara and Tomy announced their merger. It became effective on 1 March 2006. In English, the official name of the merged company is \\"TOMY Co. Ltd.\\" while in Japan the legal company name is \\"K. K. Takara-Tomy\\" (Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ„Çø„Ç´„É©„Éà„Éü„Éº ).. In deciding upon the merged company's new name, \\"Takara\\" was used for its international brand recognition and \\"Tomy\\" was used because it was a trusted brand of infant and preschool products in Japan. While Japanese commercial law allows wide latitude in translating Japanese corporate names into official English names, the merged company took the unusual step of adopting \\"TOMY Company, Ltd.\\" as its official English, while using \\"K.K.

Formed in 1991 in Northampton, Massachusetts, it comprised Joe Pernice, Stephen Desaulniers, Bruce Tull and Tom Shea. Stephen Desaulniers left the band and was replaced by Frank Padellaro in October 1996. The band at first was known as the Scuds, and their early work was influenced by electric rock. However, they sat round Tull's kitchen table every night and played acoustic country tunes, and soon decided that they enjoyed this style more. This culminated in the Scud Mountain Boys bringing the table to a concert and playing while sitting down, a move which was enthusiastically welcomed. The band released three albums before disbanding in 1997: Dance the Night Away (1995), Pine Box (1995) and Massachusetts (1996). Massachusetts was their debut on the Sub Pop label, and upon signing they negotiated for the re-release of their first two albums. The Early Year was released in 1997 and contained slightly reordered versions of Dance the Night Away and Pine Box on two CDs. Pernice, Shea and Desaulniers reunited for an impromptu performance in Cambridge in August 2011. The band announced plans for a full reunion of the original lineup in January 2012 and social networking sites confirmed involvement of Pernice, Desaulniers, Tull and Shea for the shows.

It consisted of transforming vehicles and robots piloted by miniature, magnet-shoed figures spun off from the prior Microman toy line. The toys in the 1980 line were designed by future Macross designers Shoji Kawamori and Kazutaka Miyatake (both contracted from Studio Nue), who designed the mecha and the figures respectively. Unlike Microman, which featured \\"full-scale\\" toys of its 10-centimeter-tall alien cyborgs, the figures in Diaclone represented full-sized human (and enemy alien Waruder) pilots, and were in approximately 1/60 scale. In 1982, the line later featured the Car-Robots set of transforming robot toys, invented by ≈åno K≈çjin with some initial designs by Kawamori and others. While the original series featured fanciful robots and vehicles, Car-Robots added the feature of the robots being able to disguise themselves as various late 20th century-era contemporary vehicles. In 1984, Hasbro licensed the Car-Robots toyline along with the Microman's Micro Change toyline from Takara and merged the two series of toys to create the Transformers. Most of the original Autobot vehicle-based characters came from the Car-Robots set of Diaclone robots. Other Transformers characters that came from the Diaclone line included the Dinobots, Insecticons (from the enemy Waruder toys), the Jumpstarters, the mail-order exclusive Powerdashers and Omnibots, the Decepticon planes (originally from two \\"JetRobo\\" toys, produced in the colors of future Decepticons Starscream and Thundercracker) and the Constructicons, who also came from the Car-Robots set. The Constructicons came from near the end of the series, at which point Takara was starting to abandon the Inch-Man pilot figures and being limited to the 1/60 scale. The six TrainRobo were also produced in the same sub-line as the Constructicons, but would only become Transformers (as the Trainbots) in Japan's 1987 line. Takara eventually discontinued the Diaclone and Microman toylines in 1985 in favor of the Transformers rebranding. Takara has since revived the franchise, however; first announced at Tokyo Toy Show 2015, the first proper figure of the new Diaclone line was revealed at Wonderfest of 2015. The BotCon storyline for 2015 also features several concepts from the Diaclone series, and several figures were based on Diaclone characters.

The film was made in DeLuxe Color and filmed in CinemaScope. The plot is about a German fighter pilot on the Western Front during World War I. The screenplay was written by David Pursall, Jack Seddon, and Gerald Hanley, based on the novel of the same name by Jack D. Hunter as adapted by Ben Barzman and Basilio Franchina. In contrast to films that romanticize the flying aces of the Great War, The Blue Max depicts the protagonist as a man who appears to have no regard for anyone but himself. Set against the realities of modern warfare, the film also explores the decline of chivalry and the advent of total war. Plot Caudron Luciole & Pfalz D.III from Lynn Garrison‚Äôs collection in flight over Weston Aerodrome, Ireland German Corporal Bruno Stachel (George Peppard) leaves the fighting in the trenches to become an officer and fighter pilot in the German Army Air Service. Joining a squadron in spring 1918, he sets his sights on winning Germany's highest medal for valour, the Blue Max, for which he must shoot down 20 aircraft. Of humble origins (his father ran a hotel with 5 bedrooms), Lieutenant Bruno Stachel considers himself the equal of the aristocratic pilots in his fighter squadron and sets out to prove it. Meanwhile, Willi von Klugemann (Jeremy Kemp), resents having a commoner as his rival.Their commanding officer, Hauptmann Otto Heidemann (Karl Michael Vogler) is an aristocratic officer whose belief in chivalry and the laws and customs of war conflict with Stachel's disregard for them. On his first mission, Stachel, in a Pfalz D.III, shoots down a British S.E.5, but does not receive credit for his kill because there were no witnesses. Stachel searches the countryside for the wreckage, giving the impression that he cares more about himself than the combat death of a comrade in arms. In his defense, he points out to his fellow pilots that in his time in the trenches there were so many dead, no one had time to grieve over a single person. Soon afterward he attacks an Allied two-man observation aircraft, incapacitating the rear gunner. Instead of downing the defenseless aircraft he signals the pilot to fly to the German base. As they near the airfield the wounded rear gunner revives and reaches for his machine-gun, unseen by the admiring observers on the ground. Stachel is forced to shoot the aircraft down. Afterwards, a disgusted Heidemann believes Stachel has committed a war crime just to gain a confirmed kill. The incident brings Stachel to the attention of General Count von Klugemann (James Mason), Willi's uncle. When the General comes to the base to award his nephew the Blue Max he meets Stachel. As Stachel is a commoner the General sees great propaganda potential in him. Meanwhile, Kaeti (Ursula Andress), the general's wife, is carrying on a discreet affair with her husband's nephew. Soon afterward, Stachel is shot down after rescuing a red Fokker Dr.I triplane fighter plane from two British fighters. When he returns to the airfield he is stunned when he is introduced to the man he saved: Manfred von Richthofen (Carl Schell) ‚Äì the Red Baron. Richthofen offers Stachel a place in his squadron which Stachel declines explaining his desire to \\"prove himself\\" with his current squadron. With Stachel temporarily grounded owing to a minor injury General von Klugemann orders him to Berlin to help shore up crumbling public morale. The General invites him to dinner, and after all the guests have left, he and Kaeti have sex. Upon his return Stachel taunts an outraged Willi with the news. Soon after Stachel and Willi volunteer to escort a reconnaissance aircraft. British fighters attack their Fokker Dr. 1 triplanes. Stachel's guns jam, but Willi downs three Allied planes and the rest disengage. As the two return to their base Willi challenges Stachel, partly by executing a near- perfect barrel roll, to return in formation with Stachel. Spotting a bridge, Willi dives under the wide middle span, but Stachel tops him by flying under a much narrower side one. Reluctantly Willi does the same, but, by not looking where he is going clips the top of a tower afterward and fatally crashes. When Stachel reports his death Heidemann assumes the two verified victories were Willi's. Insulted, Stachel impulsively claims them, even though he fired only 40 bullets before his guns jammed. Outraged, Heidemann reports to Berlin and accuses Stachel of lying. Yet the Air Service takes Stachel's word for it. Later, when he again has sex with Kaeti, he admits he lied. During a strafing mission covering the retreat of the Imperial German Army Stachel disobeys orders not to engage enemy fighters. One by one the rest of the squadron follow him. Afterward Heidemann confronts him with the fact that half the squadron was killed in the ensuing dogfight, yet Stachel cares only that he has shot down enough aircraft‚Äîeven without Willi's kills‚Äîto qualify for the Blue Max. Enraged, Heidemann submits a report recommending court martial proceedings. The two men are ordered to Berlin. There, von Klugemann tells Heidemann that Stachel is to receive the Blue Max. Explaining that the people need a hero he orders Heidemann to withdraw his report. Germany is, he says, waging total war against Allied soldiers and civilians... and Stachel is the perfect hero for modern warfare. Sickened, Heidemann resigns his command and accepts a desk job. Later that evening the Countess visits Stachel and suggests that they elope to neutral Switzerland since Allied victory is inevitable. When he declines she says that she knows Field Marshal von Lenndorf, whom Stachel had already met when seeing in a wind tunnel a model of an upcoming monoplane whose flying characteristics are reported by General von Klugemann as \\"risky\\", and can get him a transfer out of harm's way. Kaeti storms out when Stachel refuses to give up combat flying. The next day, Stachel is awarded the Blue Max by the Crown Prince (Roger Ostime) in a well- publicised ceremony. However an enraged Field Marshal von Lenndorf telephones von Klugermann to order him to stop the ceremony. The General informs him that this is impossible. An investigation had been opened into Stachel's false claim. The General then asks how the Field Marshal knew about this. While listening on the phone he turns to his wife and realizes that she had provided von Lenndorf with Stachel's confession. When Heidemann reports that the new monoplane he has just test-flown is a \\"death trap\\", with weak struts, von Klugemann sees a way to avoid a scandal that would otherwise harm the war effort and the officer corps as well as destroy his own career. He tells Stachel, \\"Let's see some real flying.\\" Heidemann is shocked to see the aircraft leaving the tarmac but is unable to stop it in time. He silently observes the General calmly watching from the office window. After several minutes the stress of Stachel's aerobatics causes the aircraft to break up and plunge to the ground. Just before it hits the ground and explodes von Klugemann rubber-stamps and signs Stachel's personnel file and says to his aide, Holbach (Anton Diffring), \\"Give this to the Field Marshal. It is the personal file of a German officer ... and a hero.\\" Outside, Captain Heidemann salutes von Klugemann who walks off with his wife. The General and the Countess are driven away in a staff car while the smoke from Stachel's burning aircraft rises in the background.

Although youthful looking, at 37 years of age, he was much older than the Stachel depicted in the novel. Peppard wanted to create an \\"authentic\\" performance and learned to fly, earned a private pilot's license and did some of his own flying in the film,Mizrahi 1966, p. cover illustration. although stunt pilot Derek Piggott was at the controls for the under-the-bridge scene. Novel Jack Hunter's debut novel was published in 1964. The New York Times called it \\"entertaining\\". The novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox who, in October 1964, assigned Ben Barzman and Basilio Franchina to write the script. In December, Fox announced they would make the film the following summer. =Film versus novel= Pour le M√©rite, informally known as the \\"Blue Max\\", the highest military honour that the Kingdom of Prussia could bestow during World War I. The film differs from the book on which it is based both in the plot and the portrayal of the characters. Some of the differences are: Stachel: The movie portrays Stachel initially as an idealistic, humble, and naive man who evolves into someone willing to do whatever it takes to get his way. He is also depicted as being insecure about his lower-class background and desires to prove himself an equal aviator and man to the aristocrats by earning the Blue Max. The vain attempt by Stachel to confirm his first kill is only found in the film. There is also no confrontation with Heidemann who takes a swift dislike to Stachel over claiming aircraft that Willi had shot down. Stachel was played by a 37-year- old George Peppard, in stark contrast to the 19-year-old character of the novel. From the beginning of the novel, Stachel is a deeply troubled alcoholic with a penchant for lying. Obsessed with earning the last of the new Fokker D.VIIs, he kills Willi to obtain it. In the novel Heidemann exhibits an immediate favouritism toward the newcomer, and credits Stachel with his first victories while Kettering, the squadron adjutant, refuses to comply until Heidemann orders him to do so. At the end of the novel, Heidemann reveals that he has been secretly boosting Stachel's achievements as part of an experiment in publicity management. Stachel earns his Blue Max not from 20 victories, but by destroying three aircraft and capturing one after Heidemann's guns jam. (Stachel is so drunk, he cannot even recall the engagement.) He is also honoured for saving the life of a French girl who falls into a river. Stachel does not die in the book, and in fact meets the future commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, then-Hauptmann Hermann G√∂ring. Stachel marries Kaeti von Klugermann after the death of Graf von Klugermann, as noted at the beginning of The Blood Order, the second book in Jack Hunter's Stachel series. Hauptmann Heidemann: Heidemann's deep longing to be with his wife and her growing depression over his absence are more subtle in the movie than in the book. In the novel, Heidemann does not accuse Stachel of brutality in the shooting down of the British aircraft over their airfield. He regards Stachel as the best pilot in the Jasta after himself, and has already planned to assign Stachel one of the new Fokker D.VIIs. In the novel, Heidemann (not General von Klugermann) is the one who recognises the propaganda value of building Stachel up into a hero and uses this as a means to get himself reassigned to Berlin, to be near his wife. Willi von Klugermann: Willi is described as a \\"fat aristocrat\\" in the book who has only one victory more than Stachel. In the film, Willi is leaner, more arrogant and competitive and earns a Blue Max shortly after Stachel's arrival. In the book, Willi regards Stachel as a close friend, and his affair with Kaeti is revealed only after his death when Stachel reads his journal. Unlike the movie, they are never rivals for her affection. In the novel, Willi is murdered by Stachel to obtain the last of the five new Fokker D VIIs allotted to the squadron. In the movie, Willi is accidentally killed in an aerial competition with Stachel over who is the better pilot. General von Klugermann: In the movie, the count is a career General-Oberst in the German Army. In the novel, his title is Graf and he is a famous surgeon who has researched alcoholism and other addictions. Unlike the film, the Graf and Gr√§fin do not have an open marriage. In the film, General von Klugermann recognises the social turmoil erupting in Germany and presents Stachel as a lower-class hero. Doctor von Klugermann, an aristocrat, recognises the unfair nature of Germany's class system ‚Äì something he disapproves of, but makes no effort to change. K√§ti von Klugermann: Kaeti's character in the book and film are similar. The Gr√§fin, comes from the lower classes, but relishes her status and wealth. Both characters deftly employ sexuality to get what they want. In the book, while drunk, Stachel extorts money from K√§ti with his knowledge of her affair with Willi. Later, she blackmails Stachel to marry her by threatening to reveal his murder of Willi and two British pilots. In the film, she proposes that Stachel run away with her to Switzerland, something he refuses to do. For this slight, she exposes Stachel's lies. Her husband, the General, then sends Stachel to his death in an unstable aircraft to preserve the honour of the officer corps. Elfi Heidemann: In both the novel and the film, Elfi is a nurse stationed in Berlin. In the book, Elfi is an alcoholic who overcomes her addiction with the assistance of Doctor von Klugermann. Stachel recognises Elfi as his kindred spirit, and after Heidemann's death, seeks to form a relationship with her. K√§ti literally stops him at Elfi's door, forcing Stachel to marry her instead. Stachel ruefully accepts his fate to return to K√§ti and alcoholism. Corporal Rupp: Rupp has only a minor role in the movie. In the novel, he is an Unteroffizier and thoroughly distasteful character, whom Stachel describes as \\"a pig of a man\\". He earns extra money by smuggling cheap booze to Stachel, and using one of the squadron's reconnaissance cameras to take pornographic pictures for Kettering's extensive collection of erotica. In the end, it is Rupp who provides Kaeti with evidence that implicates Stachel in Willi's murder. Conclusion: In the movie, Heidemann flies the monoplane first and determines that it is a \\"death trap\\" because the struts are too weak for the wing loading. General von Klugermann then sends Stachel to his death to shield the German Officer Corps from the shame of Stachel's false claim of two victories. In the novel, it is Stachel who tries out the new monoplane, finds the defect, and then allows Heidemann to fly the aircraft. Before Heidemann takes off, Stachel tries to stop him to save his life; however, Heidemann continues and dies. Hunter's novel ends with Stachel meeting a young Hermann G√∂ring, who has assumed command of the vaunted \\"Flying Circus\\" after the death of its commander, Manfred von Richthofen.

Aviation History; Leesburg Vol. 25, Iss. 6, (Jul 2015): 54-58. =Stunt flying= The majority of the aircraft used in the film were converted Tiger Moths and Stampe SV.4s. Two Pfalz D.IIIs were produced (by two separate companies) for the film, along with three Fokker D.VIIs and two Fokker Dr.I triplanes. Other German aircraft were represented by repainted Tiger Moths and Stampes. Two SE 5 flying replicas were made by the Miles Aircraft company at Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, England. Other British aircraft were mocked-up trainers made into British S.E.5s. The German lozenge camouflage was not universal to all units at the time the story takes place (Spring 1918), but, in the film, aircraft of all German units are shown in this scheme. The Fokker Dr.I triplanes are purpose-built replicas. The Tiger Moth silhouette was more appropriate to British aircraft of the period, such as the S.E.5a (one of which Stachel shoots down during his first mission) and presents a good general impression of actual contemporary aircraft. Fokker E.V Fokker D.VIII Morane MS 230 The \\"death-trap\\" monoplane at the end of the film, known as the \\"Adler\\" (German for eagle) in the novel, may have been inspired by the Fokker E.V, which was a late-war monoplane design which did indeed rapidly gather a reputation for poor construction of the wing, resulting in several crashes before being modified and re-designated the Fokker D.VIII. In the film it is portrayed by Patrick Lindsay's Morane 230 Parasol trainer, with a faired-over front seat to simulate a monoplane fighter visually.MacCarthy, Fiona. \\"Someone was silly.\\" The New York Times, February 3, 1991.Fletcher, Terry. \\"Morane Saulnier MS-230.\\" AerialVisuals.ca, 2015. Retrieved: 17 August 2015. The depictions of aerial combat in the film are particularly realistic. The aircraft ground scenes were shot at Weston Aerodrome near Dublin (which should not to be confused with RAF Weston-on-the-Green, England). Pilots from the Irish Air Corps helped recreate the live dog-fight scenes, supported by number of civilians, including Charles Boddington and Derek Piggott. Piggott was the only pilot willing to fly beneath the spans of a bridge. Taking the role of both German pilots and with multiple takes from contrasting camera angles, he ended up flying 15 times under the wide span of the Carrickabrack Railway Viaduct in Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland, and 17 times under the narrower span. The two Fokker Dr.I triplane replicas had about of clearance on each side when passing through the narrower span. He was able to fly through the arch reliably by aligning two scaffolding poles, one in the river and one on the far bank. Just before the scenes of flying beneath the bridge, one of the Triplanes executes what could be considered a near-perfect barrel roll as seen from aft of the two Dr.Is used for the scene. Off screen, actor George Peppard flew one of the Pfalz used in the movie.Garrison, Lynn. \\"A Pfalz Friend.\\" Air Progress, October 1979, p. 57. The director had placed a flock of sheep next to the bridge so that they would scatter as the aircraft approached to show that the stunt was real and not simulated with models. However, by later takes, the sheep had become accustomed to the aircraft, and had to be scared by the shepherd instead. In the printed take, the sheep continued to graze, creating a continuity error which can be seen in the finished film. The entire collection of aircraft, uniforms and supporting equipment was purchased from 20th Century Fox by ex-Royal Canadian Air Force pilot Lynn Garrison. He kept the collection together in Ireland under his company, Blue Max Aviation, Ltd. Over the following years they played a part in You Can't Win 'Em All, Darling Lili, Zeppelin, Von Richthofen and Brown, and various television commercials, including a classic Ridley Scott production promoting Opel's limited edition \\"Blue Max.\\" Both of the Pfalz replicas and one Fokker D.VII now belong to New Zealand film director Peter Jackson's 1914‚Äì18 Trust, with the Viv Bellamy- designed Pfalz now being on display at the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre in New Zealand. All three aircraft are kept in fully airworthy condition. Another of the Fokker D.VII's is on display at the Southern Museum of Flight in Birmingham, Alabama. =Locations= The scenes where the Germans come into the French village were filmed on Calary Bog in County Wicklow, Ireland. For many weeks, the building of the village attracted the locals to watch it coming up. Then it was bombed and made to look destroyed. It was a local tourist attraction for a long time after the film had wrapped. The Berlin scenes were shot in Dublin. Christ Church Cathedral and Leinster House, the seat of the Oireachtas, the Irish national parliament, are easily recognisable in the background of many scenes and Trinity College served as the army headquarters where von Klugermann's office is located. Many of the flying scenes were shot at Weston Aerodrome (EIWT) near Lucan, Ireland, about 10 miles west of Dublin hence the name confusion with Weston-on-the-Green. Weston Aerodrome is also home to the National Flight Center.\\"National Flight Center.\\" nfc.ie. Retrieved: 17 January 2012. There is also a restaurant named after the movie at the Aerodrome.\\"The Blue Max Bistro.\\" The Blue Max Bistro. Retrieved: 17 January 2012. The final scene where Stachel meets his fate was filmed at Baldonnel, the Irish Air Corps' main base. The hangars seen in the movie were built for the Royal Air Force in 1918. The Carrickabrack Viaduct in Fermoy, Co. Cork was used for the scenes where Stachel and Von Klugermann flew several times under the railway bridge. The view from the 19th century railway bridge which spans the River Blackwater is spectacular and it was one of the reasons the producers of The Blue Max chose it as one of the locations for the film. The railway line linked Mallow, Co. Cork to Waterford City. In 1967 the railway line was closed by CI√â. =Historical accuracy= In an article entitled \\"About The Blue Max the author, Jack D.

Goldsmith said of this experience \\"I admit it worked fairly well but my first reaction was to get up and walk away from the job. Once you've heard music like that with the picture, it makes your own scoring more difficult to arrive at.\\" Goldsmith used a large orchestra, some cues requiring over 100 musicians, with large brass and percussion sections as well as a wind machine. On 4 April 1966, he conducted the soundtrack with the National Philharmonic Orchestra led by Sidney Sax at Shepperton Studios in London. These recordings were released on LP by Mainstream Records in 1966, and re-released on LP by Citadel Records in 1976.

Reception Although The Blue Max was seen as a quasi-historical account, some critics decried what they considered an intrusive sub-plot tying a World War I story into the \\"modern theme of the corruption of the military-industrial complex.\\"Farmer 1988, p. 32. Even though the music and the flying scenes were considered the film's redemption, some aviation observers criticised what they thought was a wooden characterisation by Peppard's performance of a dog- fighting combat pilot from military aviation's heroic age.Harwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 61. Robert Alden of The New York Times wrote, \\"What is by far the best thing about 'The Blue Max' ... is that this √©lan, this glory, is captured on film once again. With the technological improvements of the years, the skies were never bluer or wider, the war in the air or on the ground never more realistic ... The question each filmgoer will have to ask himself is how much of what is bad in 'The Blue Max' is he willing to take in exchange for what is good. Much of the earthbound drama of this lengthy film is tangled, confusing, clumsy.\\"Alden, Robert (June 22, 1966). \\"Screen: 'Blue Max' Recreates an Era\\". The New York Times. 38. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called it \\"a World War I combat drama with some exciting aerial sequences helping to enliven a somewhat grounded, meller script in which no principal character engenders much sympathy.\\"Murphy, Arthur D. (June 22, 1966). \\"Film Reviews: The Blue Max\\". Variety. 6. Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote of the film that \\"The aerial dogfights have thrilling impact ... Its fault is that it doesn't give one anybody to pull for, so that aside from admiration for the men who fly these flimsy, antiquated crates one's sympathies are rarely engaged.\\"Scheuer, Philip L. (June 29, 1966). \\"Aerial Dogfights, Ursula Fly High in 'Blue Max'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote that \\"the flight sequences and the fantastically frail- looking planes run away with the picture ... Director John Guillemin rightly makes the most of Skeets Kelly's aerial photography and those fabulous flying crates, but on the ground he misses what might have been an absorbing statement.\\"Coe, Richard L. (July 1, 1966). \\"'Blue Max' At Playhouse\\". The Washington Post. D12. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"the aerial dogfights are imaginative and lively\\" and James Mason \\"is in fine form,\\" but \\"the film is padded out with tedious chunks of indoor chat between its set of largely unpleasant characters, filmed flatly in gloomy shades of grey and green for the most part.\\" =Box office= The Blue Max was a financial success at the box office, earning $5 million in North American rentals in 1966.\\"Big Rental Pictures of 1966\\". Variety, 4 January 1967, p. 8. According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $14,200,000 in rentals to break even and made $16,850,000. By September 1970 it made Fox a profit of $2,830,000.Silverman p 259 =Legacy= Director Peter Jackson lists the film as one of the top six World War I films.

The label was founded by Larry Uttal after he was ousted from Bell Records. The label primarily focused on pop music and had numerous hit records, many of them one-hit wonders, including singles by David Soul of Starsky and Hutch fame (\\"Don't Give Up on Us\\"), Starbuck (\\"Moonlight Feels Right\\"), Austin Roberts (\\"Rocky\\"), Samantha Sang (\\"Emotion\\"), Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band (\\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\"), Cyndi Grecco (\\"Making Our Dreams Come True,\\" a.k.a. the theme song to Laverne & Shirley) and Frankie Valli (\\"My Eyes Adored You\\", \\"Swearin' to God\\", \\"Our Day Will Come\\"). The label also released Brownsville Station's album with the same name, and the singles \\"The Martian Boogie\\" and \\"(Lady) Put the Light on Me\\" in 1977, Ever during 1976 and 1977 was released two album by Jose Feliciano, \\"Sweet Soul Music\\" (produced by Jerry Wexler) and \\"Angela\\" (soundtrack of the movie Aaron Loves Angela). More indicative of the label's nature, Private Stock issued for the US in 1976 a compilation of Rod Stewart's work with Steampacket and the Hoochie Koochie Men culled from mid-1960s live shows in the UK while the singer was transitioning from Mercury Records to Warner Brothers. In the early 1980s a Stray Cats compilation appeared in stores, ostensibly a licensee of Capitol Records but debatable as to whether it was even the same company. Blondie's eponymous debut album‚Äîwhich was not a commercial success at the time‚Äîwas also originally issued on Private Stock in 1976, as were two final single releases by Junior Campbell. Following the demise of Woody Woodmansey's U-Boat, singer/songwriter Phil Murray signed to the label in 1978, and released one single, End Of My Time, before moving on to Mickie Most's label RAK. Singer-songwriter Tom Paxton's 1975 album, Something in My Life and Rupert Holmes' fourth album, Pursuit of Happiness were also released by the label. Peter Lemongello released one album and a few singles for Private Stock after his debut Love '76. However, the Love '76 album was never released by Private Stock, and none of his recordings for the label charted. Gospel/soul singer Cissy Houston (mother of singer Whitney Houston) released two albums on the label- 1977's Cissy Houston and 1978's Think It Over. The label closed down when Uttal moved to London; he later returned to New York, where he died in 1993. His son Jai Uttal owned the rights to the catalogue after his father's death.

It also distributed hip hop record labels including Death Row Records, Hoo-Bangin' Records, No Limit Records, Posthuman Records, Rap-A- Lot Records, Rawkus Records, Roc-A-Fella Records, Ruthless Records and Wu-Tang Records. According to Billboard, \\"few record labels were as important to the rise of West Coast hip hop as Priority Records.\\"  Company history  = Beginnings (1985‚Äì1996) = The Los Angeles-based company (with no ties or relations to a previous Priority Records label that was a subsidiary of what was then CBS Records) was formed in 1985 by three former K-tel executives: Bryan Turner, Mark Cerami and Steve Drath. Initial funding was provided by R-tek, a company headed by former K-tel board members: Ray and Harold Kives, and their company took an initial 50% ownership in Priority. Priority bought out the R-tek interest in 1987. Its first success came with novelty act the California Raisins. To support early operations, Priority Records licensed repertoire from others and released compilation albums using archive recordings while developing its own artist roster. Priority Records achieved success as an independent label by developing a precedent-setting \\"street- based\\" formula of underground marketing which bypassed mainstream radio. This approach allowed Priority to sell millions of records without entering into the fiercely competitive major label battles over radio airplay. Priority's strategic marketing team was developed by Vice President Alyssa Pisano, who led Priority's Marketing and Creative Services Department between 1987 and 1996. Priority's roster featured numerous gold, platinum and multi-platinum artists, including N.W.A, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy-E, Master P, Snoop Dogg, Silkk the Shocker, Jay-Z, Paris, Mack 10, 504 Boyz, C-Murder, Mia X, Westside Connection, No Limit and Ice-T. = EMI acquisition (1996‚Äì2004) = In the early 1990s, the label struck up a distribution deal with EMI, while continuing to operate independently. EMI bought a 50% stake in Priority in 1996, and the remainder in 1998. Despite EMI's full ownership, Priority continued to be independently managed company until 2001, when its operations were merged into EMI's major US subsidiary, Capitol Records. Priority was absorbed into Capitol Records in 2004 and ceased operations. = Relaunch (2006‚Äì2013) = In late 2006, EMI revived Priority Records, and it was supposed to start releasing new records again but never did except for a couple compilation and greatest hits albums from the likes of N.W.A, Westside Connection, Mack 10, and Ice Cube. In 2009, Snoop Dogg was appointed creative chairman of the label; Priority released Snoop Dogg's tenth studio album, Malice N Wonderland on December 8, 2009. In July 2013, Priority was re- launched via a joint venture between Capitol Records and Insurgency Music. Based at the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, the new Priority Records will be a producer centric label that focuses on a broader array of music genres, including electronic music as well as urban music. = Second relaunch (2015‚Äìpresent) = In 2015, due to the success of the 2015 American biographical film Straight Outta Compton based on former Priority act N.W.A, Priority Records was relaunched one more time as a distributor. This time the focus was on new acts, including G Perico, Snoh Aalegra and Jonn Hart. In 2018 Priority Records partnered with TuneGO. Priority Records signed TuneGO Artist, Three Guests and distributed their album, 3G (2018).

The film, which is an Anglo-French production, is based on the 1928 play Journey's End by R. C. Sherriff with additional material from the memoir Sagittarius Rising by Cecil Lewis. It was directed by Jack Gold. The screenplay was written by Howard Barker. Aces High turns the trench warfare of Journey's End into the aerial battles fought above the Western Front by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1917. The film covers a week of a squadron where the high death rate puts an enormous strain on the surviving pilots. Many characters from Journey's End are maintained such as the idealistic officer whose sister is the girlfriend of a more senior officer who drinks too much, and the neuralgia-suffering officer accused of funking or cowardly fright. Plot In October 1916, fighter ace John Gresham (Malcolm McDowell) speaks to the senior class at Eton College. A year later, new recruit, 2nd Lt. Croft (Peter Firth), arrives at Gresham's temporary base in northern France. Gresham had been his house captain at Eton and is also the boyfriend of Croft's older sister. Gresham relies on alcohol to continue flying because of severe combat stress. Faced with being responsible for the safety of Croft (and the potential impact his loss would have on his sister), Gresham drinks even more heavily. Croft is forced to learn quickly on how to survive - both in the air and on the ground - because aerial combat and squadron etiquette are both merciless. In his week-long rite of passage from naive schoolboy to military pilot, his youthful adoration of Gresham is replaced with respect as he comes to understand the severe strain endured by his commanding officer. By the end of the week, Croft seems to have acquired the necessary combat skills when he shoots down his first plane. However, he is suddenly killed in an air-to-air collision with a German aircraft. Back at base, Gresham sees an apparition of an uninjured, smiling Croft through his office window. After the image fades, Gresham orders the next young replacement pilots to be sent in for his inspection.

Although initially wary of it being an aviation film, Gold agreed after Howard Barker revised the screenplay. Gold said he was attracted to the film because \\"That was innocence, extreme youth, marred lives of these pilots who knew they are going to die. And we could show not only chivalry and bravery but also the fear.\\" \\"What interests me is human relationships,\\" said Gold. \\"Aces High has aerial battle scenes but they're not just thrown in. It has songs but they're not just cue music. They do tell something about the characters.\\" The movie was co-financed by EMI Films. =Casting= Peter Firth and Christopher Plummer joined Malcolm McDowell, who agreed to appear in the film because Gold had such a good reputation among actors at the time. =Filming= The shooting schedule took seven weeks with one week for rehearsal. Exteriors were shot Spain and in Southern England with principal photography at Booker Airfield, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, as well as St Katharine Docks and Eton College. Interiors were completed at Pinewood Studios.Orriss 2013, p 133. The production paid close attention to authenticity with First World War era equipment being used throughout the film such as the airfield facilities, barracks and motor transport. The depicted squadron (known as 76 Squadron)which was actually stationed in England throughout WWI and never saw combat duty is loosely based on 56 Squadron, which flew the S.E.5 that regained Allied air superiority in mid 1917. Some scenes are based on real RFC stories, such as pilots choosing between jumping to their deaths or burning alive in their aircraft (as they were not issued parachutes). The juvenile mess room songs and young pilots \\"public school\\" attitudes capture the fatalistic attitudes of the time, when the life expectancy of a new pilot could be measured in weeks. Aerial sequences S.E.5a (200 h.p. geared Hispano-Suiza with 4-bladed propeller) of No. 56 Squadron RAF. Although the film reused some aerial sequences from The Blue Max (1966) and Von Richthofen and Brown (1971), the producers shot their own flight scenes. All British S.E.5s were heavily modified Stampe SV.4s, a Belgian two-seat trainer that first flew in the 1930s. Gresham's plane was a period Avro 504.Carlson 22. p. 50. German aircraft were all adapted post-WWI aircraft except for a replica Fokker E-III . The reproduction is seen when it is brought down intact and its pilot given a toast by his British counterparts.Beck 2016, p. 10. Production stills show Malcolm McDowell (Gresham) posing with a Bristol M.1C but this particular plane does not appear in the finished film. Director Jack Gold later recalled \\"It was very difficult to obtain those planes. Sometimes we used models or archive footage. Action sequences in the air were very difficult to make and they were also very much tied with story. I had great assistant in Derek Cracknell and great specialist for special effects.\\" Release The film was not shown in US cinemas. HBO premiered it in 1979. Reception Film historian Michael Paris saw Aces High as another of the period films that attempted to \\"de-mystologise\\" warfare.Paris 1995, p. 46. Film archivist and historian Stephen Pendo saw the \\"good aerial photography by Gerry Fisher\\" as the strength of a film that played more as \\"standard fare\\".Pendo 1985, p. 115.

He was the father of Edward Stanly, and the grandfather of Confederate general Lewis Armistead. Stanly, the son of John Wright Stanly, was born in New Bern, North Carolina, and educated by private tutors before attending Princeton University. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1799. After practicing law and serving as a clerk and master in equity, Stanly was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1798 and 1799. In 1800, Stanly was elected as a Federalist to the 7th United States Congress (March 4, 1801 ‚Äì March 3, 1803); he served again in the 11th Congress (March 4, 1809 ‚Äì March 3, 1811) before returning to the practice of law. Stanly returned to the state house for several more terms, in 1812-1815, 1818-1819, and 1823-1825. He died in New Bern in 1834 and is buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery. He is also known for killing Richard Dobbs Spaight, a signer of the Constitution, in a famous duel in 1802. Although prosecuted for the death as a murder, he was pardoned by Gov. Benjamin Williams. As a result of the duel, North Carolina passed a strict anti-duelling law prohibiting duelists from holding public office, and listing the duel as a specific crime, as opposed to a common law offense. Stanly County, North Carolina was formed in 1841, and named in his honor.

He also served as a member in the Indian Parliament.  Early life  Viswanatha Menon was born in Kochi as the son of Narayana Menon, a lawyer, and Vadakkoot Lakshmikkuttiyamma. His father belonged to Ambady, a famous Nair family of Cochin. He was a political activist in his youth, accused in the Communist attack on the Edappally police station. He was a leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala. Starting his career as a student activist in the Indian independence movement in his alma mater Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, he became popularly known as Ambady Viswam among his peers, seniors and near ones. Menon was one of the popular youth leaders in Kochi at that time, owing to his opinions and actions against the ruling elite. A follower of Mahatma Gandhi since childhood, he was inclined towards communism during his student days due to the influence of prominent personalities around him, including his cousin A.K. Damodaran, former Indian Administrative Service official.  Career  V. Viswanatha Menon was one of the earliest members of the undivided Communist Party of India in Kochi and played an essential role in building its base during the colonial and post-colonial period of the 1940s and early 1950s. Having sacrificed his aristocratic lifestyle at his affluent family, he worked among the party ranks against the exploitation of the oppressed classes. The caste system left the less fortunate castes never achieving equal treatment. This continuing injustice inspired Menon to adopt Socialism and later on Democracy, as a means of addressing these ills. He was a two-time Member of Parliament representing CPI and later the CPI(M). He served as Finance Minister in the 1987 E.K. Nayanar-led Left Democratic Front Government. He once held the record of having presented the lengthiest Budget speech in the Kerala Legislative Assembly. He served as trade union president in FACT for 12 years, and in Indal for 14 years. He also led a Cochin Port union. During early 2000s, he distanced himself from CPI(M) due to difference of opinion on party policies. He contested from Ernakulam constituency to Lok Sabha with support from Bharatiya Janata Party and a rebel CPI(M) splinter group in 2004 and was defeated by Dr. Sebastian Paul.

Assisted by a young William Tite, he also rebuilt the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East between 1817 and 1821. Drawing showing the New Custom House Life David Laing was born in London and baptised in the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East in March 1775. In 1790 he was articled to the architect John Soane. He set up his own architectural practice in 1796, initially designing private houses. in 1801 he published a book of his designs, entitled Hints for Dwellings, Consisting of Original Designs for Cottages, Farm Houses, Villas, etc., which sold well enough to be reprinted several times. In 1810 he was appointed Surveyor to the Customs, and designed the new customs house at Plymouth. Two years later he was asked to produce plans for a new custom house in London, replacing the old building of 1718. His first suggestions were rejected, so he produced a simpler scheme, for a massive rectangular block. Laing estimated the cost at ¬£209,000, but the contract was won by Miles and Peto, with a tender of only ¬£165,000. During construction, costs escalated, and there were disputes between Laing and the contractors. In 1818 Laing published a book of plans and drawings which included details of the problems he had encountered in laying the foundations of the New Custom House. The foundations proved inadequate: in 1820, cracks appeared in the vault of the king's warehouse in the central section of the block, and four years later the facade of the long room above it collapsed, followed by the warehouse vaults themselves and the long room floor. Sir Robert Smirke, called in to investigate, reported that the work paid for had not been done to specification. The facade was rebuilt to Smirke's own design with new foundations. After the collapse of the New Custom House Laing was suspended from his post as Architect & Surveyor of the Board of Customs, and his practice was ruined. His other works included the rebuilding of St Dunstan-in-the-East, the Corn Market at Colchester and, after his dismissal from the post with the customs, Lexden Park, and the Royal Universal Infirmary for Children, Waterloo Road, London.

Early years In its beginnings, SonoRodven (As it was originally named) emerged as a local source for international compilation albums (mostly those produced in the U.S. by companies such as K-Tel). Then it started handling a small roster of local luminaries, some of them also performing as actors for its sister TV network, such as Guillermo D√°vila, Karina, Ricardo Montaner, Jose Luis Rodriguez \\"El Puma\\", Marcelo, and others. Then the roster began to grow up, and it became the second biggest local record label in Venezuela, alongside Sonogr√°fica, its biggest competitor, from the rival group \\"Empresas 1BC\\" (proprietors of rival TV network RCTV, rival radio network RCR, rival record stores chain \\"Recordland\\"). Later, in the early-middle eighties, it became the Rodven Group, also comprising Video- Rodven, a commercial home video company, as well as other small record labels that previously existed in the country, such as Velvet (thus becoming VelvetRodven and later TH-Rodven, an outlet for all Latin dance music oriented artists, and later for other youth and pop acts, such as the late 80s boyband \\"Los Chamos\\", from which emerged the Venezuelan singer Carlos Baute), Love Records, and forming alliances with other record labels from around the world for local distribution purposes (thus forming EMI-Rodven, Hispavox-Rodven, Ariola-Rodven, Wea-Rodven et al.). This made Rodven's roster even bigger, allowing for the distribution of both local and foreign acts through a complete radio/TV/distribution platform, which later gave birth also to an artist management and show services company: \\"Big Show Productions\\".

Outlaw, born near Windsor, North Carolina in Bertie County, was educated by private teachers and in the common schools. He engaged in agricultural and mercantile pursuits and was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons for a term in 1796 to 1797. He rose to the North Carolina Senate, serving in 1802 from 1806 to 1808 from 1810 to 1814, 1817, 1821, and 1822, where he was that body's speaker in 1812, 1813, and 1814. Following the resignation of Rep. Hutchins Burton, Outlaw was sent to the 18th U.S. Congress in a special election; he served for less than two months in Congress, from January 19, 1825 to March 3, 1825. Outlaw was defeated in his campaign for re-election by Willis Alston in a three-way race. Alston, who had served previously from 1799 to 1815, criticized Outlaw's vote for William H. Crawford in the contingent presidential election of 1825. Outlaw's vote reflected the vote of the 2d Congressional District (which had voted Crawford 1,516 to Jackson 957), but the voters agreed with Alston and elected him over Outlaw by a 42-31% margin (with an Adams supporter winning 27%). Afterwards, he resumed agricultural and mercantile pursuits and died in Windsor in 1825, where he is buried in his family cemetery. Outlaw was the cousin of Rep. David Outlaw.

Note that the energy E is higher in the false vacuum than that in the true vacuum or ground state, but there is a barrier preventing the field from classically rolling down to the true vacuum. Therefore, the transition to the true vacuum must be stimulated by the creation of high-energy particles or through quantum-mechanical tunneling. In quantum field theory, a false vacuum is a hypothetical vacuum that is not actively decaying, but somewhat yet not entirely stable (\\"metastable\\"). It may last for a very long time in that state (a property known as metastability), and might eventually move to a more stable state, an event known as vacuum decay. The most common suggestion of how such a change might happen is called bubble nucleation ‚Äì if a small region of the universe by chance reached a more stable vacuum, this \\"bubble\\" (also called \\"bounce\\")Tommi Markkanen et al., Cosmological Aspects of Higgs Vacuum Metastability would spread. A false vacuum exists at a local minimum of energy and is therefore not stable, in contrast to a true vacuum, which exists at a global minimum and is stable.  Definition of true vs false vacuum  A vacuum is defined as a space with as little energy in it as possible. Despite the name, the vacuum still has quantum fields. A true vacuum is stable because it is at a global minimum of energy, and is commonly assumed to coincide with a physical vacuum state we live in. It is possible that a physical vacuum state is a configuration of quantum fields representing a local minimum but not global minimum of energy. This type of vacuum state is called a \\"false vacuum\\".  Implications  = Existential threat = If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, the effects may vary from complete cessation of existing fundamental forces, elementary particles and structures comprising them, to subtle change in some cosmological parameters, mostly depending on potential difference between true and false vacuum. Some false vacuum decay scenarios are compatible with survival of structures like galaxies and stars or even life while others involve the full destruction of baryonic matter or even immediate gravitational collapse of the universe, although in this last case the possibility to causally connect (i.e nucleate) the true vacuum from inside of the false vacuum area is dubious. In a 2005 paper published in Nature, as part of their investigation into global catastrophic risks, MIT physicist Max Tegmark and Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom calculate the natural risks of the destruction of the Earth at less than 1 per gigayear from all events, including a transition to a lower vacuum state. They argue that due to observer selection effects, we might underestimate the chances of being destroyed by vacuum decay because any information about this event would reach us only at the instant when we too were destroyed. This is in contrast to events like risks from impacts, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and hypernovae, the frequencies of which we have adequate direct measures. = Inflation = Cosmic inflation may be an effect of a false vacuum, according to several theories. The inflation itself may be the consequence of the Higgs field trapped in a false vacuum state[http://publish.uwo.ca/~csmeenk2/files/FalseVacuum.pdf Chris Smeenk, False Vacuum: Early Universe Cosmology and the Development of Inflation] with Higgs self-coupling Œª and its Œ≤Œª function very close to zero at the Planck scale. A future electron-positron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations. Chaotic Inflation Theory suggests that the universe may be in either a false vacuum or a true vacuum state. Alan Guth, in his original proposal for cosmic inflation, proposed that inflation could end through quantum mechanical bubble nucleation of the sort described above. See History of Chaotic inflation theory. It was soon understood that a homogeneous and isotropic universe could not be preserved through the violent tunneling process. This led Andrei Linde and, independently, Andreas Albrecht and Paul Steinhardt, to propose \\"new inflation\\" or \\"slow roll inflation\\" in which no tunnelling occurs, and the inflationary scalar field instead graphs as a gentle slope. Vacuum decay varieties =Electroweak vacuum decay= Electroweak vacuum stability landscape as estimated in 2012 Electroweak vacuum stability landscape as estimated in 2018 The stability criteria for the electroweak interaction was first formulated in 1979N. Cabibbo, L. Maiani, G. Parisi and R. Petronzio, Bounds on the Fermions and Higgs Boson Masses in Grand Unified Theories, 1979 as a function of the masses of the theoretical Higgs boson and the heaviest fermion. Discovery of the Top quark in 1995 and the Higgs boson in 2012 have allowed physicists to validate the criteria against experiment, therefore since 2012 Electroweak interaction is considered as the most promising candidate for metastable fundamental force. The corresponding false vacuum hypothesis is called either 'Electroweak vacuum instability' or 'Higgs vacuum instability'. The present false vacuum state is called dS (De Sitter space), while tentative true vacuum is called AdS (Anti-de Sitter space). The diagrams show the uncertainty ranges of Higgs boson and top quark masses as oval-shaped lines. Underlying colors indicate if the electroweak vacuum state is likely to be stable, merely long-lived or completely unstable for given combination of masses. The \\"electroweak vacuum decay\\" hypothesis was sometimes misreported as the Higgs boson \\"ending\\" the universe. A 125.18¬±0.16 Higgs boson mass is likely to be on the metastable side of stable-metastable boundary (estimated in 2012 as .) However, a definitive answer requires much more precise measurements of the top quark's pole mass, although improved measurement precision of Higgs boson and top quark masses further reinforced the claim of physical electroweak vacuum being in the metastable state as of 2018. Nonetheless, new physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics could drastically change the stability landscape division lines, rendering previous stability and metastability criteria incorrect. If measurements of the Higgs boson and top quark suggest that our universe lies within a false vacuum of this kind, this would imply that, more than likely in many billions of years,. The article quotes Fermilab's Joseph Lykken: \\"[T]he parameters for our universe, including the Higgs [and top quark's masses] suggest that we're just at the edge of stability, in a \\"metastable\\" state. Physicists have been contemplating such a possibility for more than 30 years. Back in 1982, physicists Michael Turner and Frank Wilczek wrote in Nature that \\"without warning, a bubble of true vacuum could nucleate somewhere in the universe and move outwards...\\" the bubble's effects will propagate across the universe at nearly the speed of light from its origin in space-time. =Other decay modes= * Decay to smaller Vacuum expectation value, resulting in decrease of Casimir effect and destabilization of proton. * Decay to vacuum with larger neutrino mass (may have happened relatively recently). * Decay to vacuum with no dark energy. Bubble nucleation When the false vacuum decays, the lower-energy true vacuum forms through a process known as bubble nucleation. In this process, instanton effects cause a bubble containing the true vacuum to appear. The walls of the bubble (or domain walls) have a positive surface tension, as energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the true vacuum. The former tends as the cube of the bubble's radius while the latter is proportional to the square of its radius, so there is a critical size R_c at which the total energy of the bubble is zero; smaller bubbles tend to shrink, while larger bubbles tend to grow. To be able to nucleate, the bubble must overcome an energy barrier of height where DeltaPhi is the difference in energy between the true and false vacuums, gamma is the unknown (possibly extremely large) surface tension of the domain wall, and R is the radius of the bubble. Rewriting gives the critical radius as .}} A bubble smaller than the critical size can overcome the potential barrier via quantum tunnelling of instantons to lower energy states. For a large potential barrier, the tunneling rate per unit volume of space is given byWenyuan Ai, Aspects of False Vacuum Decay (2019) e^{-Phi_c/hbar},}} where hbar is the reduced Planck constant. As soon as a bubble of lower-energy vacuum grows beyond the critical radius defined by , the bubble's wall will begin to accelerate outward. Due to the typically large difference in energy between the false and true vacuums, the speed of the wall approaches the speed of light extremely quickly. The bubble does not produce any gravitational effects because the negative energy density of the bubble interior is cancelled out by the positive kinetic energy of the wall. Small bubbles of true vacuum can be inflated to critical size by providing energy, although required energy densities are several orders of magnitude larger than what is attained in any natural or artificial process. It is also thought that certain environments can catalyze bubble formation by lowering the potential barrier. =Nucleation seeds= In a study in 2015, it was pointed out that the vacuum decay rate could be vastly increased in the vicinity of black holes, which would serve as a nucleation seed. According to this study, a potentially catastrophic vacuum decay could be triggered at any time by primordial black holes, should they exist. A subsequent study in 2017 indicated that the bubble would collapse into a primordial black hole rather than originate from it, either by ordinary collapse or by bending space in such a way that it breaks off into a new universe. In 2019, it was found that although small non-spinning black holes may increase true vacuum nucleation rate, rapidly spinning black holes will stabilize false vacuums to decay rates lower than expected for flat space- time. Proposed alternative nucleation seeds include cosmic strings and magnetic monopoles. If particle collisions produce mini black holes then energetic collisions such as the ones produced in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) could trigger such a vacuum decay event, a scenario which has attracted the attention of the news media. It is likely to be unrealistic, because if such mini black holes can be created in collisions, they would also be created in the much more energetic collisions of cosmic radiation particles with planetary surfaces or during the early life of the universe as tentative primordial black holes. Hut and Rees note that, because cosmic ray collisions have been observed at much higher energies than those produced in terrestrial particle accelerators, these experiments should not, at least for the foreseeable future, pose a threat to our current vacuum. Particle accelerators have reached energies of only approximately eight tera electron volts (8√ó1012 eV). Cosmic ray collisions have been observed at and beyond energies of 5*1019 eV, six million times more powerful ‚Äì the so-called Greisen‚ÄìZatsepin‚ÄìKuzmin limit ‚Äì and cosmic rays in vicinity of origin may be more powerful yet. John Leslie has argued that if present trends continue, particle accelerators will exceed the energy given off in naturally occurring cosmic ray collisions by the year 2150. Fears of this kind were raised by critics of both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider at the time of their respective proposal, and determined to be unfounded by scientific inquiry.

The first model was the OZ-7000 released in 1989, making it one of the first electronic organizers to be sold. The name OZ-7000 was used for the USA market, while in Europe the device was known as the IQ-7000. The OZ-7000 was about 6.3 inches (163 mm) tall, 3.7 inches (94 mm) wide closed, 7.25 inches (184 mm) open, and 0.85 inches (21.5 mm) thick closed, making it much larger than current PDAs. It featured a serial port (proprietary connector) to attach to a Windows PC or Macintosh or another OZ-7xxx/OZ-8xxx device, an optional thermal printer port and a cassette tape backup. The OZ-7000/IQ-7000 model featured 32 kilobytes of internal memory and a 96 x 64 dot (8 lines x 16 characters or 4 lines x 12 characters) black and white LCD with controllable contrast but without a back light. A major advertised feature of the model was the IC Cards expansion slot for accessory cards developed by Sharp. The expansion cards (IC Cards) were about the same size and shape of PC Cards but predated this standard and were incompatible with the latter. The IC Cards were inserted in a slot behind a transparent plastic panel with an overlay touch-sensitive sensor organized in a 4x5 array of touch zones, thus allowing up to 20 \\"buttons\\" to be used for control of IC Cards functions. The selection of IC cards included memory expansion cards, a thesaurus dictionary, a Time and Expense Manager, an Investment Planner, a bilingual and 8-Language translators, an \\"Encyclopaedia of Wine\\" and even games like \\"Box Jockey\\" (a Sokoban clone), Tetris, chess and backgammon. A spreadsheet software card capable of handling 26 columns by 999 rows tables compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 was available too. The out-of-the-box functionality of the OZ-7000/IQ-7000 included a memo pad, a telephone pad, calendar and scheduling with alarms and repeating events, multi-time zone clocks, and a calculator, thus covering all the basic functions found in PDAs since. The keyboard was not QWERTY, although later models, starting with OZ/IQ-8000, changed the orientation of the screen and keyboard layout. In 1991 Sharp released, only to the European market, an enhanced version of IQ-7000 ‚Äî the IQ-7200 with internal memory increased up to 64K. The OZ-8000 followed later in 1991, with a larger (240 x 64 dot) screen and 64K of internal, non- volatile memory. The OZ-8200 was launched at the same time with 128K of internal non-volatile memory. Both models shared the same form factor. A custom fitted leather, padded carrying case was also available for both models. The devices opened in landscape rather than portrait orientation with the IC Cards slot position changed accordingly. The OZ-9600 and OZ-9600II were the last of in this family of PDA in the Wizard line. Later Wizard organizers were smaller, dispensing with the expansion slot and soon bore little resemblance to the original OZ-7000. In 1991 Sharp released also a series of IC cards allowing programming in BASIC for the OZ-7000, thus turning the organizer to more a PDA-like device. The same version of BASIC had been used in later Sharp PDAs, both Wizards and pocket computers such as the Sharp PC-E500S. The line of devices utilizing touch-controlled IC cards had been concluded with the IQ-8500 model. Starting with the OZ-8900 and, later, the OZ-9xxx series, Sharp moved to production of clam-shell design/touch-sensitive display devices. Newer Wizards had an integrated IR transmitter allowing data exchange with PCs or other OZ-9xxx devices. The innovative design had the main features of the initial Zaurus line which continued this PDA family for Sharp. Due to new features, IC Cards for these devices were not backwards compatible with the OZ-7xxx series. Opened Sharp Electronic Organizer (sold as Sharp Wizard in the US) model ZQ-770. The later Sharp Wizards were something between an electronic databank and a PDA. They were small, lightweight devices with keyboards but no touch screen running on a Zilog Z80. Starting with the ZQ-770 model numbers had the prefixes either of OZ (for the USA market, where the prefix from the beginning was meant to be a pun on The Wizard of Oz) or ZQ (rest of the world) followed by a number, for instance ZQ-770, a non-US organizer with 3 MB memory, thus abandoning the IQ prefix used earlier.

It is part of Universal Music Group. Established in 1996, the label has distributed releases from 'out of style' genres such as disco and early hip- hop music as well as publishing film soundtracks. The label's name is a pun on the name 'hippo'. History The name \\"Hip-O Records\\" is a play on the word \\"hip\\" and the already-existing Rhino Records. The formation of Hip-O Records has its roots in Universal Music Group Chairman & CEO Doug Morris' relationship with Rhino. As co-Chairman of Atlantic Records during the early 1990s and then President & C.O.O. of Warner Music Group (U.S.), Morris observed Rhino's great financial success at cross country rivals Capitol/EMI. EMI had taken an equity position in Rhino Records as an ideal two way relationship. Rhino provided invaluable assistance in the packaging and marketing of EMI's catalog, and EMI provided Rhino with increasingly difficult to access master recordings. Their association had been extremely prestigious and profitable for both. During a 1992 renegotiation, Morris took a 50% stake in Rhino, which only energized the profitability and success of both. Morris left Warner Music Group in 1995 during an internal shake-up and immediately landed at what was then called MCA Music Entertainment Group. He recognized the history of the group's labels provided a parallel opportunity to market the vintage catalog of masters, but Rhino's magical executive team was tied up tight in the deal he signed with them at Atlantic. Morris launched his own catalog label that shadowed Rhino Records in every way, down to the company's name. Today, as part of Universal Music Group, Hip-O reissues many albums from UMG's huge back catalogue - including such labels as Decca, Interscope, Geffen, A&M;, Mercury, Polydor, MCA, Island and others. Hip-O Select Hip-O Select, Hip-O's limited edition reissue label, was co-founded by UMe VP Pat Lawrence and former Rhino Records exec Thane Tierney. It released remastered classics by artists including The Supremes, Chuck Berry, Rupert Holmes, Bo Diddley, Ken Nordine, Etta James, Dobie Gray, The Miracles, Burt Bacharach, Tammi Terrell, Doug Sahm, and Muddy Waters, among others. It released the Complete Motown Singles, a series of fourteen box sets which include both sides of every single from Motown Records and its subsidiaries during that company's Detroit era. Their catalog includes a number of previously unreleased albums and compilations from the Motown, Mercury, Polydor, MCA, ABC, A&M;, Dot, Decca, and 20th Century Records vaults. Hip-O Select also released a multi-volume set of James Brown's complete singles. Unlike limited releases made by competitor Rhino Handmade, Hip-O Select has its catalog available for purchase on iTunes.

It was designed to have a shallow draft, carry three people and their gear, and be light enough to be portaged by one man, the guide. Typical dimensions are 16 feet long, with a 38 inch beam, and weighing 60 pounds. While superficially resembling a canoe in size and profile, its construction methods are very different and are one of its defining features. The stem and ribs are made from spruce, a wood which has a very good strength to weight ratio. The hull is planked up with cedar laps, with seams tacked with copper tacks. The hull has a bottom board, like a dory, typically made of pine. Ribs are traditionally cut from spruce roots which have a grain following the desired curvature of the rib. Since 1962 the annual Willard Hanmer Guideboat Race has been held on the closest Sunday to the 4th of July in Saranac Lake. It is a 10-mile canoe and kayak race on Lake Flower and down the Saranac River. Modern hand-crafted versions can sell for about 20,000 US dollars.

From 2005 to 2010 she represented the 93rd District in the Ohio House of Representatives, which includes Guernsey, Monroe and Noble counties, most of Washington County, and part of Muskingum County, all in southeast Ohio. On August 3, 2009 Garrison announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Secretary of State. Garrison withdrew from the Ohio Secretary of State race in January 2010. She resigned from the State House in November 2010 to take the position of Commissioner of the Ohio State Employment Relations Board. Her nomination, a recess appointment by outgoing Democratic Governor Ted Strickland, was rejected by the Republican-majority Ohio Senate less than a month later. She declared her candidacy for Ohio's 6th congressional district in the 2014 election on 12 July 2013. Biography Jennifer Garrison was born in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, the daughter of a union plumber. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics and business administration from Xavier University, and a J.D. degree from Catholic University Law School in Washington, D.C. While in college, she worked as an intern for the Congressional Budget Office, and for the Ohio Department of Transportation and Ohio Department of Natural Resources as a legislative assistant in Washington. Garrison then completed a judicial clerkship in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and became a practicing attorney. She moved to Marietta in 1990, joining the law firm of McCauley, Webster & Emrick, where she became a partner in 1993. Three years later, she opened a private law practice, concentrating on family mediation. She ran the Washington County Visitation Mediation Project for seven years, providing free mediation to parents working out their custody and visitation conflicts. She has served on the boards of the domestic violence shelter EVE and the Washington County Mental Health & Alcohol Addiction Board, and as Commissioner on the Marietta Civil Service Board. Garrison is licensed to practice law in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. She served as president of the Washington County, Ohio Bar Association from 1996 to 1997. Ohio House of Representatives In 2004, Garrison unseated former twelve-day Ohio Gov. Nancy P. Hollister to win her seat with 51.6% of the vote. In 2006, Garrison was reelected with 71% of the vote against Republican challenger Donald J. Gadd, mayor of Byesville, Ohio. She served as Ranking Member of the Juvenile and Family Law Committee, and on the Education, Ranking Member on Public Utilities and Energy, and Finance and Appropriations Committees and the Primary and Secondary Education Subcommittee. She won reelection in 2008 with 68% of the vote against Republican Wayne Smith. In 2009 she was elected by her peers as Majority Floor Leader in the Ohio House of Representatives. In 2011, Garrison established the Southeastern Ohio Landowners Association (SEOLA), a not-for profit, association to assist mineral owners in the collective negotiation of oil and gas leases for the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations.

Beginning at Front Street West in the south, the thoroughfare heads north to end at College Street just south of Queen's Park. At its north end, the Ontario Legislative Building serves as a prominent terminating vista. Many of Toronto's most important institutions are located along the eight-lane wide street such as Osgoode Hall and other legal institutions, the Four Seasons Centre, major hospitals conducting research and teaching, and landmark office buildings for the commercial sector, notably major financial and insurance industry firms. The portion of University Avenue between Queen Street West and College Street is laid out as a boulevard, with several memorials, statues, gardens, and fountains concentrated in a landscaped median dividing the opposite directions of travel, giving it a ceremonial character. Route description University Avenue near College Street, circa 1900 South African War Memorial by Walter Seymour Allward stands in the median just north of Queen Street West The Adam Beck Memorial is located in the landscaped median, between northbound and southbound lanes just south of Queen Street West University Avenue begins at the intersection of Front and York streets near Union Station and heads northwest for a short distance before turning north. Lanes on the left ends as ramp to underground parking garage. At Adelaide Street West, the avenue divides slightly, leaving room for a median of greenery and sculptures between the north and southbound lanes. Southbound University runs diagonally to meet with York Street at Front Street West then continues south as York Street to Queens Quay and ends as a driveway signed as Harbour Square. The avenue ends at College Street, where it splits into Queen's Park Crescent East (northbound) and Queen's Park Crescent West (southbound). Between these two roads is Queen's Park, the home of the Ontario Legislative Building. This landmark creates a terminating vista for those looking north along University. The legislature's site was originally home to the main building of the University of Toronto, and this is the origin of the avenue's name. Today, the university surrounds the legislature building. Queen's Park Crescent is a single street north to Bloor Street. North of Bloor Street, the road continues as Avenue Road. While Yonge Street is the emotional heart of the city and Bay Street the financial hub, University Avenue is Toronto's most ceremonial thoroughfare, with many of the city's most prominent institutions. The boulevard is unusually wide for Canadian cities (except for Winnipeg), as it expands from 6 lanes wide (just past the jog at Front and York streets) to eight lanes wide (just past the divide past Adelaide Street). The speed limit is 50 km/h, reduced from 60 km/h. The northernmost part of the street is dominated by a series of hospitals including Toronto General Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and The Hospital for Sick Children. The concentration of hospitals on this portion of the street has led to it being given the nickname \\"Hospital Row\\" by locals and the media. The intersection of University and College is also home to the headquarters of Ontario Power Generation. The rest of the street is home to a variety of corporate offices and government buildings. Historically, this imposing street has been met with mixed reviews. Noted Canadian author and historian Pierre Berton commented that University Avenue \\"was rendered antiseptic by the presence of hospitals and insurance offices...the pristine display of wall-to-wall concrete that ran from Front Street to Queen's Park.\\" University Avenue has matured and mellowed somewhat since Berton's unfavourable observation, though paving is still characterized by poured concrete and asphalt for most sidewalks and roadway. Restaurants now dot the southern end of University Avenue. Recently completed at the intersection of University and Queen Street is the Four Seasons Centre, which is the new home of the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Osgoode Hall presents stately architecture and a welcome green space. During the holiday season, festive lights illuminate the trees and shrubs of the boulevard. Unlike most major streets in Toronto, there are no rooftop billboards visible from University Avenue due to a bylaw. A portion of the University line portion of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line runs the length of University Avenue. History University Avenue was originally made up of two streets, College Avenue and University Street, and separated by a fence, but it was eventually removed and the streets were merged. The merged street ended at Queen Street until 1931, when it was extended southward to Front Street. Landmarks University Avenue features many landmark buildings and monuments. Some of these include (from south to north): * Union Station * Sun Life Centre * Shangri-La Toronto * Sun Life Building, 200 University Avenue * Bank of Canada Building * Four Seasons Centre * Adam Beck Memorial - Emanuel Hahn * South African War Memorial * Campbell House * Osgoode Hall * Canada Life Building * Toronto Courthouse * United States Consulate General of Toronto * Canadian Airman's Memorial * Toronto Rehabilitation Institute * The Hospital for Sick Children * Mount Sinai Hospital * Toronto General Hospital * Princess Margaret Cancer Centre * Ontario Power Building * Robert Hood Saunders Memorial - Emanuel Hahn * MaRS Discovery District * Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy * Ontario Legislative Building, Queen's Park References * Berton, Pierre (1995).

The label operated until 2003 when it was sold to Universal Music Group. The label itself also featured a Nashville, Tennessee-based subsidiary, DreamWorks Nashville, which specialized in country music and was shut down in 2006. The company's logo was designed by Roy Lichtenstein and was his last commission before his death in 1997.  History  In 1996, six years after Geffen sold Geffen Records to MCA Music Entertainment, he joined Spielberg and Katzenberg to form DreamWorks SKG,Tom King, The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood, p. 538, Broadway Books (New York 2001). which included the subsidiary DreamWorks Records. The logo for the label was the last project completed by artist Roy Lichtenstein. The distinctive design, incorporating musical notes in the artist's trademark \\"dream balloon,\\" debuted on the packaging for \\"Beautiful Freak,\\" the first album from Los Angeles-based Eels and the second release from the record company. Geffen Records distributed DreamWorks until 1999, when Interscope Records took over distribution duties (meanwhile, as Interscope and Geffen switched international distribution to Polydor Records, DreamWorks followed suit). Rufus Wainwright was the first to be signed to the new label in early 1996. Henry Rollins (both as a spoken-word artist and with Rollins Band), Tamar Braxton, Nelly Furtado, George Michael, Randy Newman, Morphine, Eels, comedian/actor Chris Rock, Powerman 5000, Elliott Smith, Papa Roach and others were also signed to the label. The label was presided over by Lenny Waronker and Mo Ostin, who had run Warner Bros. Records until the mid-1990s. Ostin stated at the time: \\"What you find in the record business is there is more and more a trend toward corporate control, corporate values, and here you‚Äôre dealing with a creatively oriented operation.\\"https://hitsdailydouble.com/news&id;=274756&title;+DREAMWORKS-IS- FOR-REAL It was announced on November 11, 2003 that Universal Music Group (the former MCA Music Entertainment, and parent of Interscope, Geffen, and Polydor) reached an agreement to acquire DreamWorks Records from DreamWorks SKG for \\"about $100 million\\". The purchase came at a time when the music business was \\"going through major changes\\" as it struggled to \\"counter falling sales and the impact of unofficial online music sales\\". Mo Ostin, the principal executive at DreamWorks Records, said: \\"Despite the challenges of the music business today, Universal is acquiring a wonderful asset and the sale will assure the strongest possible future for our artists\\". Under the new deal, DreamWorks Records was placed within the Interscope Geffen A&M; label, under the direction of Jimmy Iovine. DreamWorks was folded into Geffen Records in 2004. Its country music division, which began in June 1997, remained operational until January 29, 2006, when it was shut down by Universal Music Group Nashville.  DreamWorks Nashville  Between 1997 and 2006, DreamWorks also operated a division in Nashville, Tennessee for country music acts. Among the artists signed to the DreamWorks Nashville division were Jessica Andrews, Emerson Drive, Toby Keith, Randy Travis, Jimmy Wayne, and Darryl Worley. After DreamWorks Records' dissolution, former executive Scott Borchetta formed Big Machine Records in late 2005, signing several country music acts to the label. Borchetta also signed Show Dog Records in partnership with Toby Keith,All Business:Nashville Scene: Keith's New Show Dog By PHYLLIS STARK, September 10, 2005 although Keith dropped his association with the latter label in 2006.

Conn Ltd., sometimes called Conn Instruments or commonly just Conn, is a former American manufacturer of musical instruments incorporated in 1915. It bought the production facilities owned by Charles Gerard Conn, a major figure in early manufacture of brasswinds and saxophones in the USA. Its early business was based primarily on brass instruments, which were manufactured in Elkhart, Indiana. During the 1950s the bulk of its sales revenue shifted to electric organs. In 1969 the company was sold in bankruptcy to the Crowell- Collier-MacMillan publishing company. Conn was divested of its Elkhart production facilities in 1970, leaving remaining production in satellite facilities and contractor sources. The company was sold in 1980 and then again in 1985, reorganized under the parent corporation United Musical Instruments (UMI) in 1986. The assets of UMI were bought by Steinway Musical Instruments in 2000 and in January 2003 were merged with other Steinway properties into a subsidiary called Conn-Selmer. C.G. Conn survived as a brand of musical instruments manufactured by Conn-Selmer, retaining several instruments for which it was known: the Conn 8D horn, 88H trombone, 62H bass trombone, 52BSP trumpet and the 1FR flugelhorn. History =Charles Gerard Conn= The company was founded by Charles Gerard Conn (b. Phelps, New York 29 January 1844; d. Los Angeles, California 5 January 1931). In 1850 he accompanied his family to Three Rivers, Michigan and in the following year to Elkhart, Indiana. Little is known about his early life, other than that he learned to play the cornet. With the outbreak of the American Civil War he enlisted in the army on 18 May 1861 at the age of seventeen, despite his parents' protests. On 14 June 1861 he became a private in Company B, 15th Regiment Indiana Infantry, and shortly afterwards was assigned to a regimental band. When his enlistment expired he returned to Elkhart, but re-enlisted on 12 December 1863 at Niles, Michigan in Company G, 1st Michigan Sharpshooters. At the age of nineteen on 8 August 1863 he was elevated to the rank of Captain. During the Assault on Petersburg on 30 July 1864, Conn was wounded and taken prisoner. In spite of two imaginative and valiant attempts to escape, he was recaptured and spent the remainder of the war in captivity. He was honorably discharged on 28 July 1865. In 1884 Conn organized the 1st Regiment of Artillery in the Indiana Legion and became its first Colonel, a military title which stayed with him throughout the remainder of his life. He was also the first commander of the Elkhart Commandery of the Knights Templar. Colonel Conn also served as Lieutenant Colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Uniform Rank, Knights of Pythias, and was re-elected many times as Commander of the local G.A.R. post. His home at Elkhart, the Charles Gerard Conn Mansion, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. =Founding and growth of Conn's musical instrument business= After the war, Conn returned to Elkhart and established a grocery and baking business. He also played cornet in the local community band. Conn's entrance into the musical instrument manufacturing business was the result of a split lip. There are three existing stories of how this occurred, but the popularly accepted version is that Del Crampton slugged him in the mouth outside a saloon where both of them had been drinking. Conn's upper lip was severely lacerated, and it pained him so to play his cornet that he thought his playing days were over. In addition to running his store, Conn also made rubber stamps and re-plated silverware. He decided to try adhering rubber stamp material to the rim of a mouthpiece which he hoped would conform to his lips. After he showed his friends his idea, he realized that there was tremendous demand for his invention. Conn then began to contemplate manufacturing his new mouthpiece. He needed a rim with a groove which the rubber cement would adhere to more easily. It was in 1874 when Conn converted a discarded sewing machine frame into a simple lathe and started to turn out his mouthpieces and was soon in full production (Subsequently, Conn and Del Crampton became best of friends, and when Conn embarked on his political career, he was a staunch advocate of temperance). Conn patented his rubber-rimmed mouthpiece in 1875 (with patents to follow through 1877) described as \\"an elastic face [i.e., a rubber rim] where the mouthpiece comes in contact with the lips, the object being to prevent fatigue and injury to the lips.\\" About this time Conn met Eugene Victor Baptiste Dupont (b. Paris ?May 1832; d. Washington, D.C. 26 July 1881), a brass instrument maker and designer and a former employee of Henry Distin of London. In January 1876, Conn joined with Dupont under the name of Conn & Dupont, and Dupont created Conn's first instrument, the Four-in-One cornet, with crooks allowing the horn to be played in the keys of E‚ô≠, C, B‚ô≠, and A. By 1877, Conn's business had outgrown the back of his grocery store, and he purchased an idle factory building on the corner of Elkhart Avenue and East Jackson. Conn's partnership with Dupont was dissolved by March 1879, but he was successful in attracting skilled craftsmen from Europe to his factory, and in this manner he expanded his operation so that by 1905, Conn had the world's largest musical instrument factory producing a full line of wind instruments, strings, percussion, and a portable organ. Conn partnered with Albert T. Armstrong, Joseph Jones, and Emory Foster to manufacture a twin-horn disc phonograph called the 'Double- Bell Wonder' that was produced in two iterations briefly in early 1898 before a lawsuit by the Berliner Gramophone Company caused production to cease. Brick-red 'Wonder' records were also pressed for the 'Double-Bell Wonder' talking machine by the Scranton Button Works from pirated Berliner masters. Fewer than fifty 'Double-Bell Wonders' were produced of both iterations combined. Conn's first factory was destroyed by fire 29 January 1883 (his thirty-ninth birthday), and he erected a new building on the same site. In 1886 rumors began to circulate that Conn wanted to move his business to Massachusetts. Conn was induced to stay after the public raised a large sum of money by popular subscription and gave it to him. In 1887 Conn purchased Isaac Fiske's brass instrument manufactory (upon Fiske's retirement) in Worcester, Massachusetts. Fiske's operation was considered to be the best in its time. Conn operated it as a company subsidiary, and in this way he achieved his objectives. The company's product line now centered around the 'Wonder' cornet, but in 1885 Conn began importing French clarinets and flutes. Conn started production of the first American-made saxophone in 1888, after being shown an Adolphe Sax saxophone by his employee Ferdinand August Buescher and agreeing to produce a copy of it. That instrument belonged to Edward A. Lefebre, a well known soloist with both Patrick Gilmore's and John Philip Sousa's bands. After working on prototypes with advice from Lefebre, Conn settled on production models of saxophones and started regular production around 1892.Noyes, p. 123 Conn's instruments were endorsed by several leading band directors, including Sousa. In 1898, upon the suggestion of Sousa, Conn developed the first commercially successful bell-up sousaphone (\\"the rain- catcher\\"). Conn phased out the Worcester operation (production was ceased in 1898), and Conn established a store in New York City (1897‚Äì1902) which a large variety of merchandise was sold under the 'Wonder' label, which included Conn- made woodwind, brass and percussion instruments, violins, mandolins and portable reed organs. The business also distributed American-made and imported guitars, banjos and zithers. Conn's marketing included not only sales of instruments but promotion of brass bands. He founded the Conn Conservatory to train the brass instrument teachers who would be a vital component in the growth of the musical instrument industry. During the 1890s E.A. Lefebre started teaching saxophone at the Conservatory, which provided a boost to the availability of saxophone instruction and the following growth of saxophone sales into the twentieth century. Conn's company was a source of competitors as well as instruments. Notable employees who left the firm to pursue their own businesses were composer W. Paris Chambers, the founder of the Seidel Band Instrument Company William F. Seidel, the founder of the Buescher Band Instrument Company Ferdinand A. Buescher, the founder of the F.E. Olds Company Frank E. Olds, and the founder of the Martin Band Instrument Company Henry Charles Martin. Conn's second factory burned on 22 May 1910, a loss estimated between $100,000 and $500,000. Conn was en route from California to Elkhart when his factory burned, and upon arriving home he was met with a public demonstration, a way of showing popular sympathy. Conn then announced his intentions to build a third factory on the corner of East Beardsley and Conn Avenues. Construction began 15 August 1910, and by the following 12 December it was fully operational. =Conn's other enterprises= Colonel Conn was a colorful personality of the show biz sort. He believed that he could do anything. His career grew far beyond the confines of horn making. In 1880 Conn was elected Mayor of Elkhart on the Democratic ticket. He was re-elected in 1882 but did not finish the term. Ten days before the general election in 1888, Conn was drafted as an emergency candidate for the Indiana House of Representatives by the Democrats, and won the election. In 1892 he was elected to the United States Congress as Representative of the 13th District of Indiana. Two years later he was re-nominated, but declined the nomination unless the party permitted him to make the canvass on a \\"reformed\\" platform. The party would not permit this, and accepted his declination. In 1908 he ran for Governor of Indiana and lost; in 1910 he ran for Senator. Conn's term in the House was one that provided help for Civil War veterans seeking assistance. Colonel Conn also had a love affair with publishing. He founded a newspaper, the Elkhart Daily Truth, on 15 October 1889. The paper still exists as The Elkhart Truth. He published the monthly Trumpet Notes which he circulated amongst his employees and dealers. He also published a scandal sheet called The Gossip which, along with the town doings, he used occasionally to attack his competitors and enemies. While a member of Congress he purchased The Washington Times. He conducted a sensational campaign against alleged vice in the city. Eventually he found himself as a defendant in a big damage suit, but won the case. Sometime later he disposed of the paper. Colonel Conn had heavily invested money in other businesses. One of his disappointments was his involvement with early electrical generating systems. In 1904 he constructed a powerhouse and provided electrical service as a competitor to the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company. They later bought out Conn's service at a great sacrifice to himself. The turning point to Conn's financial affairs and public life took place in April 1911 when he and his wife executed a trust deed for $200,000 covering all their possessions for the purposes of bonding the Conn indebtedness and securing working capital, the longest bond to mature in ten years. Conn's money problems stemmed partly from failed ventures like his entry into the utilities business, the building of his third factory, and its loss to fire, and his loss of a costly lawsuit filed against him by a former company manager. The deed included in addition to the horn factory and what was then known as the Angledile Scale Company, and The Elkhart Truth, some sixty descriptions of real estate in Elkhart and vicinity, various real estate mortgages, 125 shares of stock in the Simplex Motor Car Company of Mishawaka, Indiana, a seagoing yacht, a lake motor launch, and much valuable personal property. Conn also lost considerable face when he was ordered by a judge to publicly apologize for publishing inflammatory comments about J. W. Pepper. The Musical Courier picked up on the legal problems and reported about how Conn was knowingly making false statements about Pepper. In his published apology, Conn attributed his aberrant behavior on an addiction to tobacco. In 1915 Conn's growing debt crisis forced him to seek a buyer for his assets. All of Colonel Conn's holdings were bought by a group of investors led by Carl Dimond Greenleaf (b. Wauseon, Ohio 27 July 1876; d. Elkhart, Indiana 10 July 1959). Conn met Greenleaf during his years in Washington, D.C., and invested in some grain mills in Ohio which Greenleaf owned. Initially Conn held onto ownership of The Elkhart Truth, but a few months after the sale of his other holdings, Conn sold The Elkhart Truth to Greenleaf and to a local entrepreneur Andrew Hubble Beardsley. The sale was detrimental to Colonel Conn's marriage. They divorced, and Mrs. Conn was allowed to retain a house in Elkhart in which she lived until her death in 1924. Colonel Conn meanwhile was allowed to keep his home in Los Angeles, California. He spent virtually the remainder of his life there and only returned to Elkhart once in 1926 to visit his sister. He remarried to a very young woman while in California, and they had a son twelve years before Conn's death in 1931. Once a very wealthy and influential man, he died almost penniless. His estate didn't have enough money in it to afford a grave marker, and a hat was passed around the horn factory to collect enough money to buy one. =Carl D. Greenleaf and C.G. Conn, Ltd., 1915-1949= Carl Greenleaf was president of Conn from 1915 to 1949. The new company was incorporated with public stock offerings under the name C.G. Conn Ltd. and the Conn trademark was updated to the official name of the new company. Greenleaf was an astute businessman, very sensitive to the market trends of the industry. While president, Greenleaf was noting the gradual extinction of the small town brass band, and of the big touring bands such as the Sousa band. To shore up the future market for band instruments, he undertook to promote band programs in schools and colleges. He proceeded to develop a close relationship and communications between the industry and music educators. His collaboration with educators such as Joseph E. Maddy and T.P. Giddings helped introduce band music into public schools. Greenleaf organized the first national band contest in 1923 and helped make possible the founding of the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. In 1928 he founded a Conn National School of Music which trained hundreds of school band directors, and this in turn helped spur the development of music programs in schools and communities across the United States. Under Greenleaf's leadership the company converted distribution from mail-order to retail dealers and expanded its product line through acquisitions. Conn founded the Continental Music retail subsidiary in 1923. At its height, the operation included a chain of over 30 music stores. During the 1920s Conn owned the Elkhart Band Instrument Company (1923‚Äì27), the Leedy Company (1927‚Äì55), a manufacturer of percussion, and 49.9% of the stock of the retailer H. & A. Selmer (1923‚Äì27). Conn purchased the drum manufacturer Ludwig and Ludwig, the instrument import/retail operation of the Carl Fischer company, and accordion manufacturer Soprani in 1929. From 1940 to 1950 they owned the Haddorff Piano Company, and from 1941 to 1942 the Straube Piano Company. Greenleaf expanded and upgraded the Conn plant to increase production and developed new lines of wind instruments to sell. By 1917 the assembly-line work force had increased to 550 employees who were turning out about 2500 instruments a month using a new hydraulic expansion process which Greenleaf introduced to the plant. In 1917 Conn introduced the Pan American brand for its second-line instruments. Conn founded the subsidiary Pan American Band Instrument Company in 1919 and later that year moved production of second-line instruments to the old Angledile Scale factory. In 1930 the Pan American company was absorbed by Conn, but the Pan American brand for Conn's second- line instruments remained in use until 1955. By 1920 Conn was producing a complete line of saxophones. In this area they had stiff competition from other big saxophone makers such as Buescher and Martin. Around 1917 Conn introduced drawn tone holes (after a patent by W.S. Haynes in 1914) eliminating the necessity of soft-soldering tone hole platforms onto the bodies of the instruments. Around 1920 Conn introduced rolled tone hole rims, a feature that enhanced the seal of the pads and extended pad life. Rolled tone holes remained a feature of Conn saxophones until 1947. By the late 1920s the success of Conn's latest \\"New Wonder\\" model saxophones with dance orchestras was gaining widespread attention, leading European manufacturers to produce horns closer to the deeper, richer, bolder \\"American\\" sound. Selmer (Paris) introduced the American-sounding \\"New Largebore\\" model in 1929 and the new Julius Keilwerth Company in Czechoslovakia produced saxophones influenced by the Conn design, including rolled tone holes and microtuners. As sax sales plateaued in 1928, Conn attempted to introduce a mezzo-soprano saxophone in the key of F and the \\"Conn-o-sax\\", a saxophone-English horn hybrid, but these instruments were soon discontinued after disappointing sales. In 1928 Conn opened its Experimental Laboratory, which was unique in the industry, under the direction of C.D.'s son Leland Burleigh Greenleaf (Wauseon, Ohio, 12 August 1904 ‚Äì Leland, Michigan, 29 March 1978). Under his directorship, the department developed the first short-action piston valves (1934), and the 'Stroboconn' (1936), the first electronic visual tuning device. It also developed the \\"Vocabell\\" (1932), a bell with no rim, which Conn described as \\"vibrat[ing] freely and in sympathy with the vibrating column of air in the instrument,\\"https://cderksen.home.xs4all.nl/Conn44H1941image.html Conn also developed the \\"Coprion\\" bell (1934), a seamless copper bell formed by directly electroplating it onto a mandrel. Under Greenleaf's saxophone specialists Allen Loomis and Hugh Loney, Conn's research and development resulted in the designs of the 6M alto (1931), 10M tenor (1934), and 12M baritone (1930). The 12M baritone was the first saxophone with both bell keys on the right side, followed by the King Voll-True II (1932) and Selmer Balanced Action (1936). The 6M alto featured an innovative double socket neck that eliminated the large collar on the body tube at the neck joint for a more positive seal and even response, later adopted for King altos and tenors. From 1935 through 1943, Conn produced the 26M and 30M \\"Connqueror\\" alto and tenor saxophones, featuring screw-adjustable keywork and improved mechanisms for the left hand cluster. The keywork was the most fully adjustable of any saxophone during that period. Conn's laboratory was expanded into the Division of Research, Development and Design in 1940, directed by Earle Kent (b Adrian, Texas 22 May 1910; d Elkhart 12 January 1994). Conn's combined abilities in close-tolerance manufacturing and electronic devices made them a valuable resource for wartime production. From mid-1942 to 1945, Conn ceased all production of musical instruments for civilian use to manufacture flat & mounted compasses, altimeters, gyro-horizon indicators, and other military instrumentation.\\"After Five 'E' Awards, New Instruments for You\\" (advertisement). Music Educators Journal, November‚ÄìDecember 1945, 49. A special application of Conn's \\"Coprion\\" process‚Äîcreating seamless brass bells by depositing copper on a mandrel‚Äîwas to manufacture silver bearing inserts for the Wright Cyclone airplane engines.\\"Silver Bearings Unleash More Speed from 5,000 Horsepower\\" (advertisement). Music Educators Journal, February‚ÄìMarch 1944. In winter 1946-47, production was again interrupted, by a 15-week labor strike.Reed, Charles Vandeveer. \\"A History of Band Instrument Manufacturing in Elkhart, Indiana.\\" Master's Thesis, Butler University, 1953. The loss in sales from those disruptions and increased competition from other manufacturers such as Selmer (Paris) and King (H. N. White) caused a serious decline in Conn's status as a major band instrument manufacturer. Conn first responded by expanding their lines of electronic musical products, developing the \\"Connsonata\\" electronic organ in 1946. They later developed the \\"Connstellation\\" model wind instruments to revitalize those product lines (28M alto saxophone with help from Santy Runyon, 1948, and brass instruments, mid-1950s). The Connstellation brasswinds remained a premium line through the 1960s. =The Paul Gazlay - Lee Greenleaf era, 1949-1969= Carl Greenleaf retired in 1949 but remained a member of the board of directors until his death in 1959. He was succeeded by Paul Gazlay. In 1958, Lee Greenleaf succeeded Gazlay as company President. Conn briefly returned to manufacture of military instrumentation during the Korean War, while continuing production of musical instruments. Priorities changed under Gazlay, with the high quality wind instruments on which the company had built its reputation becoming an increasingly marginal interest. The 28M saxophone was discontinued after 1952 and cost-cutting measures were incorporated into the manufacturing process and designs of Conn's 6M, 10M, and 12M \\"Artist\\" series saxophones. Conn shifted their emphasis to the expanding market for school band instruments and to diversifying their instrument lines. In 1956, Conn sponsored a film to promote school bands entitled Mr. B Natural. To diversify their product line, Conn acquired as subsidiaries the New Berlin Instrument Company (1954) of New Berlin, New York which produced clarinets, oboes and bassoons for Conn, the Artley Company (1959), a manufacturer of flutes and clarinets, the Janssen Piano Company (1964), and the Scherl & Roth Company (1964), a manufacturer of stringed instruments. Conn divested itself of Leedy and Ludwig in 1955, Carl Fischer retail in 1959, and New Berlin Instrument in 1961. By 1958, over half of Conn's sales revenue was from their electric organs. In 1959 Conn built a new organ factory in Madison, Indiana. The Janssen Piano assets were merged with Conn's organ division to form Conn Keyboards in 1964. In 1960, Conn acquired the Art Best Manufacturing Company (Coin Art) facility that manufactured saxophones in Nogales, Arizona. They continued manufacturing saxophones of the Vito design that were produced there, marketed as the Conn 50M and 60M alto and tenor saxophones, then moved the production of their 14M and 16M student alto and tenor saxophones to the facility in 1963. Production of other wind instruments remained in Elkhart. The late 1960s saw trends in the keyboard, wind, and stringed instrument markets that were seriously undermining Conn's position. The growing popularity of portable electronic keyboards was cutting into Conn's niche of home organs and pianos. The market for student instruments was becoming increasingly competitive, with newcomers from Japan offering products more efficiently produced, with higher quality standards, and more tailored to students' needs. Conn saxophones had ceased to be competitive in the professional market during the 1950s due to outdated designs and declining quality. By the late 1960s, their student line instruments were in competitive decline for similar reasons. By 1969, C. G. Conn, Ltd. was facing insolvency. =Company from 1969 to 2003= In 1969 C.G. Conn Ltd. was sold under bankruptcy to the Crowell-Collier MacMillan Company. In 1970, the corporate offices were moved to Oak Brook, Illinois, Conn Keyboards was moved to Carol Stream, Illinois and their piano manufacturing operation sold. Also in 1970, Conn's Elkhart manufacturing facilities were sold to Selmer (USA) and Coachmen Industries. Brasswind manufacturing moved to Abilene Texas and woodwind production was moved from Nogales, Arizona to Nogales, Mexico. A precipitous drop in product quality followed those moves, initiated as cost-cutting measures by executives not familiar with instrument production, and destroyed whatever was left of Conn's reputation in the wind instrument market. Conn introduced the modernized 7M alto saxophone; it soon acquired the same reputation for poor quality as the other \\"MexiConns,\\" sold poorly, and was discontinued. In 1970 Conn also started the Conn Guitar Division, operating out of Oak Brook, Illinois, contracting the manufacture of a new line of acoustic guitars to Tokai Gakki in Japan. Conn's acoustic guitar business ended in 1978. In 1979 Conn tried to enter the highly competitive electric guitar market, introducing a line of some original model electric guitars, and some copies of existing popular brands. (see History of Conn Guitars). In 1980 the company was sold to Daniel Henkin (b. 18 March 1930, Kansas City, Missouri, d. Elkhart, Indiana, 8 November 2012) who had served the company as an advertising manager during the 1960s. Henkin moved the corporate offices back to Elkhart and moved to re-focus the company on wind instruments. First to go were the failing electric guitar venture, which was discontinued, and Conn Keyboards, sold to Kimball. Henkin hired Tonight Show trumpeter and bandleader Doc Severinsen as Vice President of Product Development, and introduced the Conn SeverinsenPrevious Severinsen trumpets were produced by Getzen trumpet and Henkin student clarinet. In 1981 he bought the W.T. Armstrong Company, a manufacturer of flutes and marketer of H. Couf branded saxophones made by the Julius Keilwerth company of West Germany. After that acquisition the Keilwerth instruments were also sold as \\"Conn DJH Modified\\" models. The company introduced a student line of oboes and bassoons under the Artley brand in 1983. Also in 1983, Henkin acquired King Musical Instruments of Eastlake, Ohio from the defunct Seeburg Corporation's creditors. In 1985 Henkin was seeking a buyer for his companies, first selling the Conn Strobotuner division to Peterson Electro-Musical Products. Peterson continues to service the Conn line of tuners. The Swedish investment firm Sk√•ne Gripen bought Henkin's companies in 1985. In 1986 the companies were merged to create a new parent corporation, United Musical Instruments headquartered in Nogales, Arizona. UMI closed the Conn Brasswind facility in Abilene, Texas (1986), moving brass instrument production to the King plant in Eastlake. All operations were moved out of Mexico in 1987. Production of Artley flutes was moved to the W. T. Armstrong facility in Elkhart and reed instrument production was moved back from Nogales, Mexico to Nogales, Arizona. In 1990 UMI was sold to Bernhard Muskantor, one of the Sk√•ne Gripen partners. Muskantor, with family roots in the musical instrument business, desired a return of the Conn name to respectability but its arrangement with Keilwerth had recently fallen apart and the increasingly tough market with new low-cost Asian competitors kept Conn's position marginal.Bernhard Muskantor on the future of United Musical Instruments,The Music Trades, June 1990 In 2000 UMI was purchased by Steinway Musical Instruments, and in January 2003 Steinway merged the UMI assets with their subsidiary The Selmer Company to create the Conn-Selmer division. Conn Res-o-Pads Conn \\"Res-O-Pads\\" fitted to the bell-keys on a Selmer 'Pennsylvania Special' alto saxophone, made by Kohlert (Czechoslovakia) in 1938. Note that this instrument has rolled toneholes and that the edge of the pad extends over the rim of the key-cup Between 1920 and 1947, all professional-grade saxophones manufactured by C.G. Conn had rolled toneholes. In the early 1930s, Conn developed a unique type of saxophone pad called \\"Conn Res-o-Pads\\", which were specifically designed for use on saxophones with rolled toneholes.Saxophone questions from our friends & clients . . . CyberSax Tech Topics . . . Vintage & Pro SaxophonesMusicMedic.com: Measuring for Conn Res-O-Pads Conn Res-O-Pads have an internal metal reinforcing ring which is hidden under the leather covering around the circumference of the pad. Their most notable feature is that the diameter of the pad extends over the rim of the key-cup, thereby giving a slightly wider surface area for the rolled tone-hole to seal onto. Rim impressions from Res-o-Pads are minimal and unlike standard pads they cannot be \\"floated\\" in. Though designed to fix into key-cups purely via friction, most saxophone repairers glue them in place using shellac or hot melt adhesive. Res-o-Pads can be challenging to size correctly because (unlike standard saxophone pads which come in 0.5 mm size steps) they are only available in 1/32nds of an inch sizes which may not always correspond closely to key-cup diameters. Newly produced Conn Res-o-Pads are still available from specialist suppliers and are favored by some saxophone collectors because they give a fully authentic look and feel to vintage saxophones with rolled toneholes e.g. those made by Conn, Kohlert and Keilwerth. However, it is possible to fit standard pads to any saxophone with rolled toneholes (and many people do) without any noticeable disadvantage regarding the quality of sound produced.Conn 6M \\"Underslung\\" alto sax review The Conn Microtuner From 1922 to 1950 Conn manufactured alto and c-melody saxophones with a unique tuning device on the neck known as the \\"Conn Microtuner.\\" The feature was devised to allow the saxophone to be tuned while maintaining optimal volume in the chamber of the mouthpiece, thus avoiding disturbance to intonation. The device adjusts the length of the neck, controlled by a threaded barrel near the mouthpiece end.Servicing the Conn Microtuner To lower the pitch, the barrel was rotated to the left. To raise the pitch the barrel was rotated to the right. The benefits of the microtuner to intonation have been shown to be more theoretical than practical, with the drawbacks that the internal mechanism requires extra cleaning and maintenance and is a potential source of leaks. Some repair technicians who have play-tested large numbers of Conn altos (cf. Les Arbuckle of Saxoasis.com) report that the microtuner necks lend a different sound quality from those without one. Early Keilwerth and other German-made saxophones also featured microtuners. Since the 1950s, all new saxophones use the traditional tuning method of pulling out or pushing in the mouthpiece on the cork until the pitch is correct.

His most significant contribution to the fields of educational psychology, cognitive science, and science education learning was on the development and research on \\"advance organizers\\" (see below) since 1960.Advance organizers Biography =Family= He was born on October 25, 1918 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York.Ausubel, D.P. David Ausubel. Retrieved June 9, 2010, from http://www.davidausubel.org/ He was nephew of the Jewish historian Nathan Ausubel. Ausubel and his wife Pearl had two children. =Education= He studied at the University of Pennsylvania where he graduated with honors in 1939, receiving a bachelor's degree majoring in psychology. Ausubel later graduated from medical school in 1943 at Middlesex University where he went on to complete a rotating internship at Gouverneur Hospital, located in the lower east side of Manhattan, New York. Following his military service with the US Public Health Service, Ausubel earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in developmental psychology from Columbia University in 1950.Verification needed for Ausubel's study at NYU (per personal website has PhD from Columbia). He continued to hold a series of professorships at several schools of education. =Psychiatrist= In 1973, Ausubel retired from academic life and devoted himself to his psychiatric practice. During his psychiatric practice, Ausubel published many books as well as articles in psychiatric and psychological journals. In 1976, he received the Thorndike Award from the American Psychological Association for \\"Distinguished Psychological Contributions to Education\\". =Author= In 1994, at the age of 75, Ausubel retired from professional life to devote himself full-time to writing. He then published four books: * Ego development and Psychopathology (1996), * The Acquisition and Retention of Knowledge (2000), * Theory and Problems of Adolescent Development (2002), and * Death and the Human Condition (2002), ** In Death and the Human Condition he wrote about the psychology of death and impressed his own personal psychological, theological and philosophical thoughts on the nature and implications of the afterlife,Ausubel, David. 2002. Death and the Human Condition. iUniverse. (Preface). conceptualizing death from the perspective of both Christian believers and non-believers, expressing his view that \\"the relevance and value of faith should certainly not be derogated or treated pejoratively, as atheists, agnostics, and rationalists tend to do.\\"Ausubel, David. 2002. Death and the Human Condition. iUniverse. p. 46 =Death= He died on July 9, 2008.http://www.davidausubel.org/ Influences Ausubel was influenced by the teachings of Jean Piaget. Similar to Piaget‚Äôs ideas of conceptual schemes, Ausubel related this to his explanation of how people acquire knowledge. \\"David Ausubel theorized that people acquire knowledge primarily by being exposed directly to it rather than through discovery\\" (Woolfolk et al., 2010, p. 288)Woolfolk, A.E., Winne, P.H., Perry, N.E., & Shapka, J. (2010). Educational Psychology (4th ed). Toronto: Pearson Canada. In other words, Ausubel believed that an understanding of concepts, principles, and ideas is achieved through deductive reasoning. Similarly, he believed in the idea of meaningful learning as opposed to rote memorization. In the preface to his book Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View, he says that \\"If [he] had to reduce all of educational psychology to just one principle, [he] would say this: The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach him accordingly\\" (Ausubel, 1968, p. vi)Ausubel, D.P. (1968). Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston. Through his belief of meaningful learning, Ausubel developed his theory of advance organizers. However, Ausubel was a critic of discovery-based teaching techniques, stating: > Actual examination of the research literature allegedly supportive of > learning by discovery reveals that valid evidence of this nature is > virtually nonexistent. It appears that the various enthusiasts of the > discovery method have been supporting each other research-wise by taking in > each other's laundry, so to speak, that is, by citing each other's opinions > and assertions as evidence and by generalizing wildly from equivocal and > even negative findings. Advance organizers An advance organizer is information presented by an instructor that helps the student organize new incoming information.Mayer, Richard E. Learning and Instruction. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Merrill, 2003. ] This is achieved by directing attention to what is important in the coming material, highlighting relationships, and providing a reminder about relevant prior knowledge. Advance organizers make it easier to learn new material of a complex or otherwise difficult nature, provided the following two conditions are met: :1. The student must process and understand the information presented in the organizer‚Äîthis increases the effectiveness of the organizer itself. :2. The organizer must indicate the relations among the basic concepts and terms that will be used. =Types= Ausubel distinguishes between two kinds of advance organizer: comparative and expository. 1. Comparative Organizers The main goal of comparative organizers is to activate existing schemas. Similarly, they act as reminders to bring into the working memory of what one may not realize is relevant. By acting as reminders, the organizer points out explicitly \\"whether already established anchoring ideas are nonspecifically or specifically relevant to the learning material\\" (Ausubel & Robinson, 1969, p. 146).Ausubel, D.P., Robinson, F.G. (1969). School Learning: An Introduction To Educational Psychology. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston. Similarly, a comparative organizer is used both to integrate as well as discriminate. It \\"integrate[s] new ideas with basically similar concepts in cognitive structure, as well as increase[s] discriminability between new and existing ideas which are essentially different but confusably similar\\" (Ausubel, 1968, p. 149). An example of a comparative organizer would be one used for a history lesson on revolutions. This organizer \\"might be a statement that contrasts military uprisings with the physical and social changes involved in the Industrial Revolution\\" (Woolfolk et al., 2010, p. 289). Furthermore, one could also compare common aspects of other revolutions from different nations. 2. Expository Organizers \\"In contrast, expository organizers provide new knowledge that students will need to understand the upcoming information\\" (Woolfolk et al., 2010, p. 289). Expository organizers are often used when the new learning material is unfamiliar to the learner. They often relate what the learner already knows with the new and unfamiliar material‚Äîthis in turn is aimed to make the unfamiliar material more plausible to the learner. An example which Ausubel and Floyd G. Robinson provides in their book School Learning: An Introduction To Educational Psychology is the concept of the Darwinian theory of evolution. To make the Darwinian theory of evolution more plausible, an expository organizer would have a combination of relatedness to general relevant knowledge that is already present, as well as relevance for the more detailed Darwinian theory. Essentially, expository organizers furnish an anchor in terms that are already familiar to the learner. Another example would be the concept of a right angle in a mathematics class. A teacher could ask students to point out examples of right angles that they can find in the classroom. By asking students to do this, it helps relates the students present knowledge of familiar classroom objects with the unfamiliar concept of a 90 degree right angle. =Criticism= \\"The most persuasively voiced criticism of advance organizers is that their definition and construction are vague and, therefore, that different researchers have varying concepts of what an organizer is and can only rely on intuition in constructing one-- since nowhere, claim the critics, is it specified what their criteria are and how they can be constructed\\" (Ausubel, 1978, p. 251).Ausubel, D. (1978). \\"In defense of advance organizers: A reply to the critics.\\" Review of Educational Research, 48(2), 251-257. In a response to critics, Ausubel defends advance organizers by stating that there is no one specific example in constructing advance organizers as they \\"always depends on the nature of the learning material, the age of the learner, and his degree of prior familiarity with the learning passage\\" (Ausubel, 1978, p. 251). Another criticism of Ausubel‚Äôs advance organizers is that the critics often compare the idea of advance organizers with overviews. However, Ausubel has addressed that issue in saying that advance organizers differ from overviews \\"in being relatable to presumed ideational content in the learner‚Äôs current cognitive structure\\" (Ausubel, 1978, p. 252). Thirdly, critics also address the notion of advance organizers on whether they are intended to favour high ability or low ability students. However, Ausubel notes that \\"advance organizers are designed to favour meaningful learning..\\" (Ausubel, 1978, p. 255). Therefore, to question whether advance organizers are better suited for high or low ability students is unrelated as Ausubel argues that advance organizers can be catered to any student to aid them in bridging a gap between what they already know and what they are about to learn.

Allen Wallis), or one-way ANOVA on ranks is a non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution. It is used for comparing two or more independent samples of equal or different sample sizes. It extends the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test, which is used for comparing only two groups. The parametric equivalent of the Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test is the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A significant Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test indicates that at least one sample stochastically dominates one other sample. The test does not identify where this stochastic dominance occurs or for how many pairs of groups stochastic dominance obtains. For analyzing the specific sample pairs for stochastic dominance, Dunn's test, pairwise Mann‚ÄìWhitney tests with Bonferroni correction, or the more powerful but less well known Conover‚ÄìIman test are sometimes used. Since it is a non-parametric method, the Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test does not assume a normal distribution of the residuals, unlike the analogous one-way analysis of variance. If the researcher can make the assumptions of an identically shaped and scaled distribution for all groups, except for any difference in medians, then the null hypothesis is that the medians of all groups are equal, and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one population median of one group is different from the population median of at least one other group. Method # Rank all data from all groups together; i.e., rank the data from 1 to N ignoring group membership. Assign any tied values the average of the ranks they would have received had they not been tied. # The test statistic is given by: #:H = (N-1)frac{sum_{i=1}^g n_i(bar{r}_{icdot} - bar{r})^2}{sum_{i=1}^gsum_{j=1}^{n_i}(r_{ij} - bar{r})^2}, where: #*n_i is the number of observations in group i #*r_{ij} is the rank (among all observations) of observation j from group i #*N is the total number of observations across all groups #*bar{r}_{icdot} = frac{sum_{j=1}^{n_i}{r_{ij}}}{n_i} is the average rank of all observations in group i #*bar{r} =tfrac 12 (N+1) is the average of all the r_{ij}. # If the data contain no ties the denominator of the expression for H is exactly (N-1)N(N+1)/12 and bar{r}=tfrac{N+1}{2}. Thus #: begin{align} H & = frac{12}{N(N+1)}sum_{i=1}^g n_i left(bar{r}_{icdot} - frac{N+1}{2}right)^2  & = frac{12}{N(N+1)}sum_{i=1}^g n_i bar{r}_{icdot }^2 - 3(N+1) end{align} The last formula only contains the squares of the average ranks. # A correction for ties if using the short-cut formula described in the previous point can be made by dividing H by 1 - frac{sum_{i=1}^G (t_i^3 - t_i)}{N^3-N}, where G is the number of groupings of different tied ranks, and ti is the number of tied values within group i that are tied at a particular value. This correction usually makes little difference in the value of H unless there are a large number of ties. # Finally, the decision to reject or not the null hypothesis is made by comparing H to a critical value H_c obtained from a table or a software for a given significance or alpha level. If H is bigger than H_c, the null hypothesis is rejected. If possible (no ties, sample not too big) one should compare H to the critical value obtained from the exact distribution of H. Otherwise, the distribution of H can be approximated by a chi-squared distribution with g-1 degrees of freedom. If some n_i values are small (i.e., less than 5) the exact probability distribution of H can be quite different from this chi-squared distribution. If a table of the chi-squared probability distribution is available, the critical value of chi-squared, chi^2_{alpha: g-1}, can be found by entering the table at g ‚àí 1 degrees of freedom and looking under the desired significance or alpha level. # If the statistic is not significant, then there is no evidence of stochastic dominance between the samples. However, if the test is significant then at least one sample stochastically dominates another sample. Therefore, a researcher might use sample contrasts between individual sample pairs, or post hoc tests using Dunn's test, which (1) properly employs the same rankings as the Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test, and (2) properly employs the pooled variance implied by the null hypothesis of the Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test in order to determine which of the sample pairs are significantly different. When performing multiple sample contrasts or tests, the Type I error rate tends to become inflated, raising concerns about multiple comparisons. Exact probability tables A large amount of computing resources is required to compute exact probabilities for the Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test. Existing software only provides exact probabilities for sample sizes less than about 30 participants. These software programs rely on asymptotic approximation for larger sample sizes. Exact probability values for larger sample sizes are available. Spurrier (2003) published exact probability tables for samples as large as 45 participants. Meyer and Seaman (2006) produced exact probability distributions for samples as large as 105 participants. Critical value tables and exact probabilities from Meyer and Seaman are available for download at http://faculty.virginia.edu/kruskal-wallis/ . A paper describing their work may also be found there. Exact distribution of H Choi et al. made a review of two methods that had been developed to compute the exact distribution of H, proposed a new one, and compared the exact distribution to its chi-squared approximation.

OPM has a distinctive sound, combining hip hop, rock music, and pop with laid-back reggae. Band history Originally called \\"Stash\\", the name OPM, according to the band's frontman John E. Necro, is an abbreviation of the phrase \\"Open People's Minds\\" (originally \\"Other People's Money\\"). This was stated during an interview with MarijuanaRadio.com. The name also sounds like the drug opium. The band's original members were John E. Necro, Matthew Meschery and Geoff Turney, with Gary Dean and Etienne Franc later appointed permanent members in 2001. John E. and Geoff aka Casper first met on a bus ride through 2 girls they were dating in 1996. At the time John E. was a label scout at Island Records and Geoff was in a band called \\"Alpha Jerk\\". In 1997 John E. invited Geoff to do some recordings with him and his then brother-in-law Matthew Meschery. After 2 years they finally managed to start writing songs and sent a 3 track demo to Atlantic Records, leading them to get signed despite having never played live together. OPM released their debut album, Menace to Sobriety, in August 2000 on Atlantic Records. Their debut single \\"Heaven Is a Halfpipe\\" charted worldwide and won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. They performed their hit single on Top of the Pops on July 20, 2001. After the Menace to Sobriety tour, Matthew Meschery decided to leave the band. John E. Necro stated \\"that was the biggest blow of anyone\\" and \\"I don't think Matthew thought it through. It seemed like a really good idea when we got started, but it was more than he bargained for\\" during an interview in 2009. In the October 2015 edition of Rock Sound magazine, Matthew revealed he would \\"often get stage fright\\" when performing live and \\"The idea of touring another record for two years felt pretty daunting. I was done.\\" Matthew along with Etienne Franc and Gary Dean then formed a band by the name of \\"The Free Agency\\" in 2003 after they all departed OPM. As of 2007, Matthew has been working for ITVS. In 2002, they replaced Matthew with Big B and signed to Suburban Noize Records. They left Atlantic Records as they were not interested in releasing another OPM album. John E. spoke of this in 2004 by saying \\"They'd spent so much to promote the first album, that we thought everything was a go with the second record. But they kept sending us back into the studio‚Ä¶we wrote over 50 songs while waiting for the label to make a move. We finally got to the point where we realized that we needed more attention than they were giving us, so we started working on getting out of our deal.\\" Their second album, ForThemAsses, was released in June 2004. The album was produced by OPM and Steve Gallagher and features guest appearances by reggae artists Yellowman and Eek-A-Mouse along with Johnny Richter of the Kottonmouth Kings. The only single from the album was Horny which was released a year later in 2005. Jonathan Williams was then appointed as a permanent member, having provided keyboards for the ForThemAsses album. Matt Rowe was appointed as bass player in 2005 along with Robert Bradley on drums. Their third album was California Poppy, released in July 2006. The album was supported by the release of the In the OPMDEN EP in 2006. In 2008 Robert left the band and was immediately replaced by Carlos Perez. OPM released their fourth album, Golden State of Mind in September 2008. The album was produced by Michael Patterson who also produced the band's debut album. Carlos Perez then left the band to become the drummer for Big B in 2009 and was replaced by Shane Mayo. The band joined the new label MNO records, founded by John E. and released their single \\"Holiday Under The Sun\\" in 2010. In 2012 the band released a new EP called Heaven Can Wait to celebrate 13 years since the band's formation. When asked why a 13th anniversary, John E. Necro explained the band were originally planning a 10th anniversary, but due to a band hiatus which involved building a new studio, he claimed the 10th year \\"slipped past us, without realizing\\" and decided on 13 since it is considered an unlucky number. It featured 5 re-recordings of classic songs. In 2013 they released a new single entitled \\"Everything's The Same In LA\\". Matt Rowe and Shane Mayo left the band in 2014 to focus on their other band \\"Garrett Lee Robinson\\", who are also signed to OPM's label MNO records. In 2015 Carlos Perez returned to OPM to provide drums after originally leaving the band in 2009. OPM released their 4th EP entitled \\"The Minge Dynasty\\" in August 2015 as well as announcing a European tour for 2015. The EP features a new single called \\"Millionaire Like Me\\". Big B returns to feature on the EP, produced by Ras MG. They also re-released Menace to Sobriety in September 2015 for the 15th anniversary of the release of their debut album. The re-release featured one bonus track called \\"Feel The Pain\\", which was one of the band's first songs recorded in 1999 with the original line-up (John E., Matthew and Geoff). Members * John E.

She earned her BA in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and her PhD from Harvard University in 1978, under the direction of thesis advisor Kenneth Arrow. She is a Fellow of the Econometric Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. She previously served as a co editor of Econometrica and was a member of the Expert Panel of the Copenhagen Consensus. She received her Honorary Doctor of Laws (L.L.D) in 2012 from the University of Western Ontario. Much of her work has been done by digesting economic dynamics, which most of this work is done as an expositor. She spent a great deal of time recently researching growth theory, economic dynamics, as well as fiscal and monetary policy. Author Stokey has published significant research in the areas of economic growth and development, as well as papers on economic history (\\"A Quantitative Model of the British Industrial Revolution: 1780‚Äì1850,\\" 2001) and optimal control (\\"Dynamic Programming with Homogeneous Functions,\\" 1998, co-authored with Fernando Alvarez). She is the co-developer, with Paul Milgrom, of the no-trade theorem, a counter-intuitive development of the premises of financial economics. She co-authored with Robert Lucas, Jr. and Edward Prescott a book on Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics that is widely used by research economists and graduate students. Stokey worked with Paul Milgrom to publish \\"Information, Trade, and Common Knowledge\\" (1982), which established that information-based trade is not possible for rational agents with common knowledge. This work contributed to be one of the pillars of modern finance. She is the author of The Economics of Inaction (2009) which treats models that involve fixed costs of adjustment. Stokey has written critically about how the United Nations allocates funds for international economic development and humanitarian aid. Stokey coauthored \\"Optimal Monetary and Fiscal Policy\\" which was one of the first papers to examine the time consistency of macroeconomic policy and to demonstrate the importance of central banks following rules. Her recent research is on growth theory, economic dynamics, and fiscal and monetary policy.

Hagan (born March 31, 1949) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who held a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives for the Sixtieth District from 2007 to 2014. He represented the same seat from 1987 to 1997, and served in the Ohio Senate from 1997 to 2006. In 2014, he began work for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen governmental affairs team. Early life, family and education Hagan was born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio. He attended high school at Ursuline High School, on Youngstown's north side, but did not graduate. His father, Robert E. Hagan, was also involved in politics. His brother, Tim Hagan, served for many years as a county commissioner in Cuyahoga County, Ohio and was the 2002 Democratic nominee for Governor of Ohio. Before entering electoral politics, Hagan worked for 15 years as a locomotive engineer for CSX Transportation. Known for dressing in 1800s replica historical railroading uniforms, he earned the nickname of \\"Choo Choo Magoo,\\" a nickname that would follow him into later adulthood. Ohio House of Representatives In 1986, he was elected to a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives, representing the 53rd Ohio House district, centered on Youngstown, Ohio. At the time, his father, Robert E. Hagan, was also serving in the House. Between 1986 and 1990, the Hagans were the first father and son to simultaneously hold seats in the Ohio House of Representatives. Hagan served in the House for ten years. Ohio Senate When incumbent Joseph Vukovich was appointed to a judiciary position in 1997, Hagan was chosen to succeed him in the Ohio Senate. He was appointed to the State Senate on February 12, 1997, to represent the 33rd district in northeastern Ohio, centered on the city of Youngstown. During his time in there, he was chosen by the Senate Democratic caucus to serve as assistant minority whip in the 126th Ohio General Assembly; however, he stepped down from his leadership post when he entered the election for State Representative. In 2005, Hagan ran for mayor of Youngstown, hoping to replace outgoing mayor George McKelvey. Although initially favored to win, he was soundly defeated by independent candidate Jay Williams. In post-election interviews, he expressed remorse for his loss and blamed it on his lack of commitment as a state legislator. A strong proponent of liberal agendas, Hagan occasionally uses satire to attempt to make a point. In February 2006, he placed a spoof request for co-sponsors for a fictional piece of legislation called the \\"Republican Adoption Ban of 2006.\\" The bill was meant as a response to HB 515, which was a ban on adoption by homosexual or bisexual people or couples, and in presenting the fake legislation Hagan cited so-called \\"credible research\\" indicating that children in Republican households had a host of emotional problems. He was later mocked by his constituents during a public forum for failing to sponsor legitimate bills for their benefit. He later apologized. In April 2010, Bob Hagan co- sponsored a measure to legalize marijuana in Ohio. The bill, \\"would let doctor-certified medical marijuana users grow plants, but they would have to be kept in a locked room, greenhouse, garden, closet or other enclosed area out of view. The bill was eventually withdrawn after the allowance of closet growing raised concerns. Ohio House of Representatives Unsuccessful in his bid for Mayor of Youngstown, Hagan sought to return to Ohio House of Representatives to succeed term limited Sylvester \\"Sly\\" Patton. Against six others for the nomination, Hagan won the primary with 37.59% of the vote.2006 primary election results , Secretary of State for Ohio, 2006-05-02. He won the general election with 58.08% of the vote against Republican John Johnson. Hagan, in 2008, won reelection with 84.9% of the vote again Republican Timothy Gordon.2008 general election results , Secretary of State for Ohio, 2008-11-04.

He won the general election with 81.23% of the vote over Republican Daniel Thimons.2010 general election results , Secretary of State for Ohio, 2010-11-02. For the 129th General Assembly, Hagan served on the committees of Commerce and Labor; Health and Aging; and Transportation, Public Safety and Homeland Security. He also served on the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission. Hagan won a final term in 2012 unopposed, and was term-limited in 2014. He was succeeded by his wife Michele Lepore-Hagan. 2016 U.S. Senate election On April 17, 2013, Hagan announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat currently occupied by Republican Rob Portman. He cited Portman's vote against background checks as his motive for challenging the freshman senator. Policies and initiatives =Collective bargaining= With the city of Youngstown being majorly pro-labor, Hagan had been against a bill that looks to limit collective bargaining for public employees. While it was virtually inevitable that the bill will pass into law, Hagan vowed to lead an effort to overthrow it via a referendum. A member of the committee hearing the bill, Hagan presented his colleagues with 65,000 petitions from individuals opposing the bill, which were ordered removed from the room by chairman Joe Uecker. Hagan has cited a considerable amount of secrecy and partisanship surrounding the legislation. He has called the bill simply a bust to unions. The bill ultimately passed the entire legislature. =Governor recall= Building off his opposition to S.B. 5, Hagan introduced legislation with Michael Foley that would allow voters to recall the governor, other statewide officeholders and members of the General Assembly. They stated that the measure was initiated by John Kasich's low approval ratings and the outcry that occurred after S.B. 5. =Environmental issues= A staunch liberal, Hagan is against measures that would allow drilling for oil and natural gas in Ohio state parks. In debate on the bill, which went on to pass the Ohio House of Representatives, he went on to question whether Republicans who supported the measure were on drugs. Hagan has also sought to fight gasoline prices through legislation to create the Ohio Gasoline Price Oversight Commission. Along with Ron Gerberry, Hagan hopes to help fight rising gasoline prices. \\"This legislation is a direct response to the sacrifice our constituents are making at the pumps,\\" Rep. Hagan said. =Other= On October 22, Hagan, introduced a bill in the Ohio House that would prohibit any team playing in publicly financed stadiums or arenas from blacking out games. A violation would result in the team repaying its public funding. Controversies In 2010, Hagan was assaulted at the Lemon Grove, a bar located in Youngstown, Ohio. He was punched in the face after a verbal altercation with a fellow customer, and was treated with several stitches at a local hospital after regaining consciousness. He would later apologize for antagonizing the fellow patron. On January 20, 2011 it was reported that Hagan had referred to someone during an online debate on Facebook as a \\"buckwheat\\", a word that some consider to have racist connotations.It was not directed at Thomas. Hagan said \\"buckwheat\\" was a term he had been using \\"since he was a kid\\" and that it no longer carried racial connotation for him. On April 27, 2012, Hagan was uninvited to speak at the graduation ceremony of Mercy College School of Nursing at the request of Bishop George Murry, S.J. of Youngstown, just four days before the graduation was to take place. Bishop Murry cited Hagan's general lack of higher education and stance on abortion as the reasons for his decision.

Released on March 22, 1994, it is the rapper's final release on SBK Records. The album did not chart, and received unfavorable reviews. It has since received some degree of cult status in the hip hop community. Songs from the album made up one third of Vanilla Ice's tours during 1992-2010. The album sold just 125,000 copies in the United States considered a flop in comparison to his blockbuster debut album To the Extreme. Ice followed up this album with 1998's Hard to Swallow, which involved a switch to the record label Republic Records.  Lyrics  Cyco of Insane Poetry worked on 10 songs on the album.http://www.faygoluvers.net/v5/2015/05/insane-poetry-interview-52815/ The Wrath, one of the album's singles, was a reply to the single \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" by 3rd Bass. Mark Wahlberg, then in the rap group Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, had made negative remarks about Ice in one of his songs. Ice answered back in the song Hit 'em Hard which was almost in its entirety a dis song aimed at Mark, but Ice also included 3rd Bass and MC Hammer. Neither 3rd Bass nor Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch responded. A lot of the lyrics were drug influenced and featured references to smoking marijuana, especially in the single Roll 'em Up. The song I Go Down pays tribute to Gang Starr, Mary J. Blige and Tupac Shakur.  Reception  Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \\"more clunky than funky\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith called the song \\"Get Loose\\" \\"snappy\\", writing that although the lyrics are \\"inane\\", \\"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well [...] He sounds easy and unaffected ‚Äì close to sexy. But he doesn't keep it up: In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics [...] and his dry Max Headroom style.\\" AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \\"There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\\" Vanilla Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics were questioned by some, including Primus bassist Les Claypool, who stated in an interview for High Times, \\"He's got dreadlocks and he's got this song about smoking pot and basically he uses every little catch phrase he can think of that has to do with pot in his rap.

This glass is formed naturally by the rapid cooling of molten basalt. It is a type of mafic igneous rock that is decomposable by acids and readily fusible. The color is a black or dark-brown, and it has a greasy-looking, resinous luster. It is very brittle and occurs in dikes, veins and intrusive masses. The word originates from the , meaning swift. Tachylites have the appearance of pitch and are often more or less vesicular and sometimes spherulitic. They are very brittle and break down readily under a hammer. Small crystals of feldspar or olivine are sometimes visible in them with the unaided eye. All tachylites weather rather easily and by oxidation of their iron become dark brown or red. Three modes of occurrence characterize this rock. In all cases they are found under conditions which imply rapid cooling, but they are much less common than acid volcanic glasses (or obsidians), the reason being apparently that the basic rocks have a stronger tendency to crystallize, partly because they are more liquid and the molecules have more freedom to arrange themselves in crystalline order. Geographic occurrences =Scoria sources= The fine scoria ashes or \\"cinders\\" thrown out by basaltic volcanoes are often spongy masses of tachylite with only a few larger crystals or phenocrysts imbedded in black glass. Such tachylite volcanic bombs and scoria are frequent in Iceland, Auvergne, Stromboli and Etna, and are very common also in the ash beds or tuffs of older date, such as occur in Skye, Midlothian and Fife, Derbyshire, and elsewhere. Basic pumices of this kind are exceedingly widespread on the bottom of the sea, either dispersed in the pelagic red clay and other deposits or forming layers coated with oxides of manganese precipitated on them from the sea water. These tachylite fragments, which are usually much decomposed by the oxidation and hydration of their ferrous compounds, have taken on a dark red color. This altered basic glass is known as \\"palagonite\\"; concentric bands of it often surround kernels of unaltered tachylite, and are so soft that they are easily cut with a knife. In the palagonite the minerals are also decomposed and are represented only by pseudomorphs. The fresh tachylite glass, however, often contains lozenge-shaped crystals of plagioclase feldspar and small prisms of augite and olivine, but all these minerals very frequently occur mainly as microlites or as beautiful skeletal growths with sharply- pointed corners or ramifying processes. Palagonite tuffs are found also among the older volcanic rocks. In Iceland a broad stretch of these rocks, described as \\"the palagonite formation,\\" is said to cross the island from south-west to north-east. Some of these tuffs are fossiliferous; others are intercalated with glacial deposits. The lavas with which they occur are mostly olivine- basalts. Palagonite tuffs are found in Sicily, the Eifel, Hungary, Canary Islands, and other places. =Lava flow sources= artefacts from Australia, made of tachylite A second mode of occurrence of tachylite is in the form of lava flows. Basaltic rocks often contain a small amount of glassy ground-mass, and in the limburgites this becomes more important and conspicuous, but vitreous types are far less common in these than in the acid lavas. In the Hawaiian Islands, however, the volcanoes have poured out vast floods of black basalt, containing feldspar, augite, olivine, and iron ores in a black glassy base. They are highly liquid when discharged, and the rapid cooling that ensues on their emergence to the air prevents crystallization taking place completely. Many of them are spongy or vesicular, and their upper surfaces are often exceedingly rough and jagged, while at other times they assume rounded wave-like forms on solidification. Great caves are found where the crust has solidified and the liquid interior has subsequently flowed away, and stalactites and stalagmites of black tachylite adorn the roofs and floors. On section these growths show usually a central cavity enclosed by walls of dark brown glass in which skeletons and microliths of augite, olivine and feldspar lie imbedded. From the crater of Mt. Kilauea, thin clouds of steam rise constantly, and as the bubbles of vapor are liberated from the molten rock they carry into the air with them thin fibers of basalt that solidify at once and assume the form of tachylite threads. Under the microscope they prove to be nearly completely glassy with small circular air vesicles sometimes drawn out to long tubes. Only in the Hawaiian Islands are glassy basaltic lavas of this kind at all common. KILAUEA VOLCANO (MT. KILAUEA), James St. John, OSU- Newark, Geology A small outcrop at Spring Hill in Victoria, Australia'Unusual Newer Volcanics trachyandesite cones in the Gisborne-Woodend and Kyneton- Trentham areas' has tachylite which has been exploited as a material for making Aboriginal flaked stone implements.Clark, V. 2004. Calder Highway Kyneton to Faraday: Sub-surface Archaeological Investigations for Aboriginal Cultural Heritage in Sensitive Areas PAS1, SA1, SA4 and at Site AAV7723-0125, Near Malmsbury, Victoria. Report to VicRoads =Dike and sill sources= A third mode of occurrence of tachylite is as the margins and thin offshoots of dikes or sills of basalt and diabase. They are sometimes only a fraction of an inch in thickness, resembling a thin layer of pitch or tar on the edge of a crystalline diabase dike, but veins several inches thick are sometimes found. In these situations tachylite is rarely vesicular, but it often shows very pronounced fluxion banding accentuated by the presence of rows of spherulites that are visible as dark brown rounded spots. The spherulites have a distinct radiate structure and sometimes exhibit zones of varying color. The non- spherulitic glassy portion is sometimes perlitic, and these rocks are always brittle. Common crystals are olivine, augite and feldspar, with swarms of minute dusty black grains of magnetite. At the extreme edges the glass is often perfectly free from crystalline products, but it merges rapidly into the ordinary crystalline diabase, which in a very short distance may contain no vitreous base whatever. The spherulites may form the greater part of the mass, they may be a quarter of an inch in diameter and are occasionally much larger than this. These coarsely spherulitic rocks pass over into the variolites by increasing coarseness in the fibers of their spherulites, which soon become recognizable as needles of feldspar or feathery growths of augite. The ultimate product of decomposition in this case also is a red palagonitic substance, but owing to the absence of steam cavities the tachylite selvages of dikes are more often found in a fresh state than the basic lapilli in ash- beds. Many occurrences of basaltic pitchstones have been reported from Skye, Mull, and the western part of Scotland; they are found also in connection with the intrusive diabase sills in the north of England and the center of Scotland. In the Saar district of Germany similar rocks occur, some of which have been described as weisselbergites (from Weisselberg). Other localities for tachylites of this group are New Providence, Silesia and Sweden.

It consists of two lines: the Chollima Line, which runs north from Puh≈≠ng Station on the banks of the Taedong River to Pulg≈≠nby≈èl Station, and the Hy≈èksin Line, which runs from Kwangbok Station in the southwest to Ragw≈èn Station in the northeast. The two lines intersect at Ch≈ènu Station. Daily ridership is estimated to be between 300,000 and 700,000. Structural engineering of the Metro was completed by North Korea, with rolling stock and related electronic equipment imported from China. This was later replaced with rolling stock acquired from Germany. The Pyongyang Metro has a museum devoted to its construction and history. Construction Construction of the metro network started in 1965, and stations were opened between 1969 and 1972 by president Kim Il-sung. Most of the 16 public stations were built in the 1970s, except for the two most grandiose stations‚ÄîPuh≈≠ng and Y≈ènggwang, which were constructed in 1987. In 1971, there was a major accident during the construction of a tunnel under the Taedong River for Ponghwa Station. Some sources say at least 100 workers died in the accident. This particular section of tunnel was never completed; the metro network is now completely located on the western side of the river. China had provided technical aid for the metro's construction, sending experts to install equipment made in China, including electrical equipment made in Xiangtan, Hunan and the escalator with vertical height of 64 m made in Shanghai. Pyongyang Metro is among the deepest metros in the world, with the track at over deep underground; the metro does not have any above-ground track segments or stations. Due to the depth of the metro and the lack of outside segments, its stations can double as bomb shelters, with blast doors in place at hallways. It takes three and a half minutes from the ground to the platform by escalator. The metro is so deep that the temperature of the platform maintains a constant all year. The Saint Petersburg Metro also claims to be the deepest, based on the average depth of all its stations. The Arsenalna station on Kyiv Metro's Sviatoshynsko- Brovarska Line is currently the deepest station in the world at .–û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–∞–π—Ç –∫–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–µ–Ω–∞. Kyiv Metro. The Porta Alpina railway station, located above the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland, was supposed to be underground, but the project was indefinitely shelved in 2012. In 2012, Korean Central Television released renders of a new station bearing the name Mangyongdae displayed at the Pyongyang Architectural Festival. In 2018, commercial satellite imagery revealed possible extensions to the metro system, with activity showing three possible new underground facilities being constructed to the west of Kwangbok Station. NK News sources speculated an absence of announcements from state media was due to funding issues, as well as construction accidents during previous tunneling, which may have killed dozens of workers in the 1970s. In 2019, Kaeson station and Tongil Station were modernised, adding TVs that show the next service and brighter lighting. This was followed by Jonu station and Chonsung station in 2020. Operation The Pyongyang Metro was designed to operate every few minutes. During rush hour, the trains can operate at a minimum interval of two minutes. The trains have the ability to play music and other recordings. The Pyongyang Metro is the cheapest in the world to ride, at only five North Korean won (worth half of a US cent) per ticket. Instead of paper tickets, the Metro previously used an aluminium token, with the emblem of the Metro minted on it and the Korean \\"\\". It has used a paper ticket system, with \\"\\" printed with blue ink on it. Tickets are bought at station booths. The network uses contactless cards that feature the logo of the network and a train set on the front, with the terms and conditions on the other side. Gates display the number of trips remaining on the card, with a trip being a tap on entry and exit. Smoking and eating inside the Metro system is prohibited and is punishable by a large fine. =Network= The Pyongyang Metro network consists of two lines: * Chollima Line, named after a winged horse from ancient Korean mythology. It spans about . Construction started in 1968, and the line opened on September 6, 1973. The Mangyongdae Line forms part of the Chollima Line. The total route contains the Puhung, Yonggwang, Ponghwa, S≈≠ngni, Tongil, Kaeson, Jonu, and Pulgunbyol stations. * Hy≈èksin Line, which literally means renewal, spans about . Regular service started on October 9, 1975. The route contains the Kwangbok, Konguk, Hwanggumbol, Konsol, Hyoksin, Jonsung, Samhung, and Rakwon stations. The closed Kwangmyong station is located between the Samhung and Rakwon stations. Unlike most railway systems, the majority of the stations' names do not refer to their respective locations; instead, stations take their names from themes and characteristics reflecting North Korea's revolution. A notable exception, Kaes≈èn Station (\\"Triumph station\\"), is located at the Arch of Triumph. The network runs entirely underground. The design of the network was based on metro networks in other communist countries, in particular the Moscow Metro. Both networks share many characteristics, such as the great depth of the lines (over ) and the large distances between stations. Another common feature is the Socialist realist art on display in the stations - such as murals and statues. Staff of the Metro have a military-style uniform that is specific to these workers. Each Metro station has a free toilet for use by patrons. Stations also play state radio-broadcasts and have a display of the Rodong Sinmun newspaper. In times of war, the metro stations can serve as bomb shelters. For this purpose the stations are fitted with large steel doors. Some sources claim that large military installations are connected to the stations, and also that there exist secret lines solely for government use. One station, Kwangmy≈èng, has been closed since 1995 due to the mausoleum of Kim Il-sung being located at that station. Trains do not stop at that station. The map of the Hy≈èksin line shows two additional stations after Kwangbok: Y≈èngung () and Ch'ilgol (), both of them reportedly under development. The map of the Chollima Line, on the other hand, shows four additional stations, two at each end of the line‚ÄîRy≈ènmot (), S≈èp'o (), Ch'≈èngch'un () and Man'gy≈èngdae ()‚Äîalso planned or under development. However, the most recent maps omit these stations. In addition to the main system for passenger use, there is reportedly an extra system for government use, similar to Moscow's Metro-2. The secret Pyongyang system supposedly connects important government locations. There is also reportedly a massive underground plaza for mobilization, as well as an underground road connecting two metro stations. Rolling stock VOA report showing a ride on the former West German U-Bahn cars in 2013 When operations on the Metro started in the 1970s, newly built DK4 passenger cars were used, made for North Korea by the Chinese firm Changchun Railway Vehicles. A prototype train of DK4 cars was constructed in 1971 and the first 15 cars were sent to Pyongyang on July 30, 1973. 112 cars had been provided to North Korea by September 1978,[ÊùéÊ∞∏Êûó‰∏ªÁºñ. „ÄäÂêâÊûóÁúÅÂøó¬∑Âç∑‰∏âÂçÅ‰∏â¬∑ÂØπÂ§ñÁªèË¥∏Âøó„Äã. pp. 444‚Äì445. . but eventually 345 cars were acquired. In 1974, Kim Jong-il rode a Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works built metro set named 'Autonomy', but is no longer in service and said to be stored in the Pyongyang Metro museum. The Chinese-made rolling stock was later sold back to China for use on the Beijing Subway, where it was used in three-car sets on line 13. It has since been replaced by newer DKZ5 and DKZ6 trainsets, and it is not known if the DK4 units were returned to Pyongyang. Other sets have been observed operating near the Sinuiju area. North Koreans riding the Pyongyang Metro in 2012. The portraits above the door are of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. Since 1997, the Pyongyang Metro has used former German rolling stock from the Berlin U-Bahn. The North Korean government supposedly bought more than twice the number of trainsets required for daily use, prompting speculation that the Metro might contain hidden lines and/or stations that are not open to the public. There are two different types of rolling stock: *GI (\\"Gisela\\"), former East Berlin stock, 60 built between 1978 and 1982. *D (\\"Dora\\"), former West Berlin stock, 108 built between 1957 and 1965. The trainsets were given a new red and cream livery in Pyongyang. All advertising was removed and replaced by portraits of leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. In 2000, a BBC reporter saw \\"old East German trains complete with their original German graffiti\\". After about 2006, Type D cars were mainly used. The type GI rolling stock was withdrawn from Metro service in 2001, and those cars are now operating on the railway network around Pyongyang and northern regions. In 2015, Kim Jong-un rode a newly manufactured four car train set which was reported to have been developed and built at Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works in North Korea, although the cars appeared to be significantly renovated D-class cars. This set is named 'Underground Electric Vehicle No. 1'. It features a VVVF control and initially fitted with an Asynchronous motor but later replaced with a Permanent magnet synchronous motor developed by the Kim Chaek University of Technology. It usually runs on the Chollima Line but has also ran on the Hyoksin Line. Some class D sets have a next stop indicator installed, replacing the portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. The shunting locomotives used on the Pyongyang Metro are the GKD5B diesel electric model manufactured by China's CNR Dalian, imported in early 1996. Tourism In general, tourism in North Korea is allowed only in guided groups with no diversion allowed from pre-planned itineraries. Foreign tourists used to be allowed to travel only between Puh≈≠ng Station and Y≈ènggwang Station. However, foreign students were allowed to freely use the entire metro system. Since 2010 tourists have been allowed to ride the metro at six stations, and in 2014 all of the metro stations were opened to foreigners. University students traveling with the Pyongyang Project have also reported visiting every station. , it is possible for tourists on special Public Transport Tours to take metro rides through both lines, including visits to all stations. In April 2014, the first tourist group visited stations on both metro lines, and it is expected that such extended visits to both metro lines will remain possible for future tourist groups. The previously limited tourist access gave rise to a conspiracy theory that the metro was purely for show. It was claimed that it only consisted of two stops and that the passengers were actors. =Museum= Pyongyang Metro has its own museum. A large portion of the collection is related to President Kim Il-sung providing \\"on-the-spot guidance\\" to the workers constructing the system. Among the exhibits are a special funicular-like vehicle which the president used to descend to a station under construction (it rode down the inclined tunnels that would eventually be used by the escalators), and a railbus in which he rode around the system.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxjNF8ebN1g Pyongyang Metro Museum photo collection showing the exhibits Gallery File:Pyongyang Metro September 2015 04.jpgMural at Puh≈≠ng Station entrance File:Laika ac Pyongyang Metro (7953414514).jpg Staff in a military-style uniform File:Public newspaper reading stand in Pyongyang metro 3.jpg A public newspaper display on a platform File:Pyongyang Metro (11360664053).jpg A statue of Kim Il-sung at Kaes≈èn Station File:Ponghwa Station.

He has released four solo studio albums, in which his most recent ‚Äì Ricanstruction: The Black Rosary ‚Äì won the 2012 HHUG Album of the Year award Chino also forged a career in acting, signing with Hollywood talent manager Stacey Castro and subsequently appearing in several films and episodes of television. He was a series regular on Cinemax series Sex Chronicles and appeared in several guest star roles, including Comedy Central series Reno 911! and CBS series CSI: Miami. His feature film credits include a co-starring role opposite Kate Hudson, Luke Wilson in director Rob Reiner's Alex & Emma and Brandon Sonnier's directing debut, \\"The Beat\\", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. He is the nephew of Bernie Worrell of music group Parliament/Funkadelic. Barbosa is also a member of Mensa. Early life Chino XL was born in The Bronx, New York, United States, and is of Puerto Rican and African American ancestry.  Career  After co-founding the duo Art of Origin, the emcee was signed at age 16 by music impresario Rick Rubin to Rubin's American Recordings label, which was once part of the Warner Bros. Records family. He released his debut album Here to Save You All in 1996, which was released to critical acclaim. The lead single \\"Kreep\\" which featured an interpolation of the Radiohead song \\"Creep\\" experienced major airplay by radio and MTV. Kreep charted on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B; Chart for a record 23 weeks, from July 1996 to January 1997. Chino was released from his American Recordings contract when American Recordings switched distributors from Warner to Columbia in 1997. Warner Bros. Records then signed Chino in the fall of 1997. His sophomore album was due to be released during April 1999 but numerous delays prevented the album from being released. Although in early 2001 when the album was about to be released and its lead single \\"Let Em' Live\\" featuring Kool G Rap was nearing early pressing stages Chino was dropped by Warner, as they folded their Black music department, supposedly due to the public legal battle with Prince. The album, titled I Told You So, was eventually released in 2001 by Metro Records. In 2006, Chino released his long-awaited third album, Poison Pen. The now-iconic release featured appearances by Proof of D-12, Killah Priest and legendary hip hop duo The Beatnuts. In 2007, Chino signed a contract with the Universal Latino label Machete Music. In 2009 during a controversial interview with Allhiphop.com writer Han O'Connor, Chino revealed that his fifth studio album The RICANstruction was to be released soon. The album was released via his own joint venture CPR/Universal and featured Immortal Technique, Tech N9ne, and Bun B. The RICANstruction also featured a collaboration with Big Pun. The album featured production from DJ Khalil and Focus served as executive producer. On August 19, a song titled \\"N.I.C.E.\\" that was produced by Nick Wiz was released. On September 25, 2012 the album Ricanstruction: The Black Rosary was released as a double disc through Immortal Technique's Viper Records. It won the 2012 HHUG Album of the Year award On June 15, 2013, Shanghai :30 Entertainment booked a show with Chino XL for him to play alongside local, on- the-rise hiphop artists. In 2014, he formed a hip hop supergroup along with rappers Vakill, Copywrite, Tame One and producer Stu Bangas called Verse 48. They started working on an EP. In 2015, he featured on UK singer/rapper RKZ's single 'They Don't Know Nothing'.http://www.7thboro.com/rkz-ft-chino-xl-they- dont-know-nothing-prod-handbook/ He is currently working on his new album, which will include a track with R.A. the Rugged Man.

Bologna, Ferronii. 992 pp.Johannsen, A. (1938) A Descriptive Petrography of the Igneous Rocks. Volume 4, Part 1, The Feldspathoid Rocks and Part II, The Peridotites and Perknites. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois. 523 pp. The weathering of varioles often cause variolites to have a pock-marked appearance. In allusion to the pock-marked appearance of weathered surfaces of variolite, this term is derived from the Latin word, variola, for smallpox. Varioles are millimeter- to centimeter-scale, light-colored, globular to spherical structures, that are conspicuously observable within aphanitic, mafic igneous rocks, such as basalt, komatiite, and tachylite, that comprise either pillow lavas, subaerial lava flows, or volcanic dykes. Typically, they are less resistant to weathering than the enclosing aphanitic rock and, as a result, form pock-marks on the weathered surfaces of mafic rocks.Arndt, N., and Fowler A.D. (2004) Textures in komatiites and variolitic basalts. In: Erikson, K. ed., The Precambrian Earth: Tempos and Events. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 298‚Äì311. Sandsta, N.R., B. Robins, H. Furnes, and M. de Wit (2011) The origin of large varioles in flow-banded pillow lava from the Hooggenoeg Complex, Barberton Greenstone Belt, South Africa. Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology. vol. 162, no. 2, pp. 365‚Äì377. In the geologic literature, the usage of the term variole has been inconsistent and confusing. Initially, they were defined as spherical masses, which may or may not be spherulites, that are observed on the weathering surfaces of some basalts and diabases. In some modern literature, the term variole is defined as a type of spherulite that occurs in a mafic rock. However, because several different mechanisms can produce these small-scale, light-colored, globular to spherical structures, a specific set of varioles may or may not be spherulites that are composed of radiating crystals of either plagioclase or pyroxene. As a result, it is recommended that the term variole should be retained as originally defined. This definition is useful, not only because varioles may arise through several different mechanisms, but also because the alteration, specifically mineralization, and deformation associated with many Precambrian volcanic rocks, particularly Archean volcanic rocks, makes the determination of their origin difficult, if not impossible, without further laboratory analyses.Fowler A.D., L.S. Jensen, and S.A. Peloquin (1987) Varioles in Archean basalts; products of spherulitic crystallization. Canadian Mineralogist. vol. 25, pp. 275‚Äì289 Phillips (1973)Phillips, W.J. (1973). Interpretation of crystalline spheroidal structures in igneous rocks. Lithos. vol. 6, pp. 235-244. provides a detailed review of the nomenclature of different types of varioles that have been proposed. Confusingly, a few Earth scientists use variolite as if it is synonymous with variole.Cas, R.A.F., and J.V. Wright (1987) Volcanic Successions, Modern and Ancient: A Geological Approach to Processes, Products, and Succession United Kingdom, London, Allen & Unwin. 528 p. Petrographic and geochemical analyses of varioles demonstrates that they can be the result of one of three possible processes. They are the blotchy alteration of a fine-grained igneous rock; the mingling of magma from two distinctly different sources; and the alteration and degradation of plagioclase spherulites. These analyses also found that their internal organization and geochemistry is incompatible with the hypothesis that they are quenched immiscible liquids, as has been suggested in the past by various authors. Varieties and occurrence The variety of mafic igneous rocks that contain varioles are, with rare exceptions, no longer classified as variolites, which is not recommended for usage. Instead, they are designated using the modifier variolitic in conjunction with the major lithology. The major varieties of variolites are variolitic basalts, variolitic pillow lavas and variolitic komatiites. Variolitic pillow lavas, that have been previously identified as variolites and also classified as spilites, are found in the Durance, France; on Mont Genvre, France; in Devonian rocks of Germany; and as cobbles on the beaches of the Strait of Juan de Fuca along the northern edge of the Olympic Peninsula.Lewis, J.V.

Geological Society of America Bulletin. vol. 84, pp. 387‚Äì424 Variolitic basalts and variolitic komatiites occur commonly as Archean lava flows in the greenstone belts of South Africa and the Canadian Shield. Finally, there is a group of spotted volcanic rocks formerly known to French petrographers as the variolites du Drac from the locality in which they are found in Parc National des Ecrins, France. Additional research has found them to be hydrothermally altered basalt volcanic rocks that contain amygdules filled with white calcite and other secondary minerals.Buffet-Croix-Blanche, G.

Egg was born out of the banking arm in the United Kingdom of Prudential plc, which was established in 1996, and the Egg brand was launched in October 1998. The first online credit card was launched in September 1999. It was only possible to operate an Egg account over the internet, or via their call centre. Egg specialised in savings and general insurance, together with loans, credit cards and mortgage products. The business was sold in January 2007 to Citigroup. In March 2011, the credit card accounts were bought by Barclaycard, and in July 2011, the remaining savings and mortgage businesses were sold to Yorkshire Building Society, which subsequently transferred all remaining customer accounts over from Egg. Following the sale of its assets, Egg Banking plc, which remained under the ownership of Citigroup, was renamed Canada Square Operations Limited and continues to handle matters relating to certain Egg products from before the sale of assets and any assets that were not transferred to the new owners.http://www.citibank.co.uk/personals/cards/cards/feedback/egg.htm  History  Egg was established as a division of life assurance company Prudential. Prudential Banking was involved in direct selling of savings and mortgage products. On 11 October 1998, the division was renamed Egg, and relaunched as the United Kingdom's first Internet bank. The bank offered 8% savings interest and the first credit card in the United Kingdom, which offered a 0% interest rate on both new purchases and balance transfers, with also an annual anniversary offer, and as a result soon had more than two million customers enjoying these market leading rates. In June 2000, Prudential cashed in on its stake, and floated 21% of the company on the London Stock Exchange, retaining 79%. In January 2004, Prudential announced its intention to sell its remaining stake in Egg to a third party. Paul Gratton was chief executive of Egg in 2001. Despite rumours of interest from the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, no formal offers were made public, and Prudential dropped its plans in August 2004. Subsequently, Prudential bought back the remaining minority share in January 2006, and delisted the organisation from the London Stock Exchange. Chief executive officer Paul Gratton left the organisation in March 2006, to be replaced by then chief operating officer Mark Nancarrow. Nancarrow was subsequently replaced by Ian Kerr, formerly of HBOS, in November 2006. On 29 January 2007, Prudential announced that it had agreed to sell Egg to Citigroup for a consideration of ¬£575 million subject to approval by the Financial Services Authority. On 1 May 2007, the sale of Egg to Citi was completed, and Egg CEO Ian Kerr was appointed head of Egg and Citi UK Consumer. At the beginning of 2008, Kerr left the business and was replaced in March by Bert Pijls. Pijls joined Citi in 1990, and has held several roles in the bank. In November 2007, approximately 350 non specialist roles were moved from the Dudley centre to Derby, resulting in redundancies and relocation packages. The Dudley office was later closed. On 1 March 2011, Barclays Bank announced that they had agreed to buy Egg's more than one million credit card accounts from Citigroup. Barclay's Barclaycard division took over the Egg credit card business in May 2011, after Citi had spent time trying to sell the business as part of its Citi holdings portfolio. Citi and Barclaycard shared the same site at Pride Park, Derby, but it was announced on 21 June 2011 that Barclaycard would move operations to their Kirkby and Northampton sites, leaving 659 people redundant. On 25 July 2011, Egg announced the proposed sale of all savings and mortgage accounts to Yorkshire Building Society. This would complete Citigroup's sale of the Egg business.  Advertising  Egg used several advertising agencies to produce its advertising. These included CHI & Partners, Lowe Plus and Mother. Egg Card was launched in the United Kingdom with a television campaign by CHI and press advertisements and direct marketing created by Lowe Plus. Among the press advertisements was one showing a sea of urine samples with a headline that read 'We're just taking 10.9% APR. What's your card taking?' The press campaign was created by Colin Underhay and Alex Pearl. Pearl later went on to write the teen novel 'Sleeping with the Blackbirds'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14609964-sleeping-with-the- blackbirds and 'The Chair Man',https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49399813-the-chair- man?ac=1&from;_search=true&qid;=CEu1L7VQCm&rank;=1 a thriller based on the London 7/7 terrorist attack.  Egg France  Capitalising on its British success, Egg launched in France in November 2002 with La Carte Egg. Despite investing heavily in the market in France, the services were never popular with the French, who generally hold fewer credit cards than the British. In October 2004, Egg decided to close its French operations, selling the unsecured lending business to :fr:Banque Accord, and the savings and brokerage businesses to ING of the Netherlands.  Controversies  On 2 February 2008, Egg chose to cancel the credit cards of 161,000 (7%) of its customers. The bank gave customers 35 days' notice, after which they would not be able to spend more on their cards. While publicised as an attempt to purge \\"risky\\" customers from their books, many affected customers came forward with claims that they had excellent credit histories. This led to speculation that the move was an attempt to remove customers who did not accumulate interest on their accounts and therefore did not generate profit for the bank. The Financial Services Authority fined Egg ¬£721,000 in December 2008 for the persistent misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI) on its credit cards. The authority's director of enforcement, Margaret Cole, said \\"Egg used inappropriate sales techniques to try to persuade customers to buy payment protection insurance on their credit card, even when they asserted they did not want the cover.\\" During 2008, Egg attempted to have one of its customers imprisoned, saying the Chip and PIN cards were 'uncloneable', and the customer was 'clearly lying' about transactions from an ATM. The police arrested the customer, but after much investigation, the customer was acquitted.

He also produced television programmes and made films. Early life Born into a working-class family, Johnson was evacuated from London twice during World War Two. He was sent to a secondary modern school in High Wycombe. However, he managed to transfer to Kingston Day Commercial School, where \\"they taught me shorthand, typing, and bookkeeping. Useful.\\"The Free Library. Retrieved 1 February 2020. He left school at 16 to work variously as an accounting clerk, a bank junior, and a clerk at Standard Oil, but taught himself Latin in the evenings, attended a year's pre-university course at Birkbeck College, and with this preparation, managed to pass the university entrance exam for King's College London. Career After he graduated with a 2:2,The usual degree grades in British universities are 1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd, pass, fail. Johnson wrote a series of increasingly experimental and often acutely personal novels that would now be considered visual writing.Retrieved 21 September 2019. In his early years he collaborated on several projects with a close friend and fellow writer, Zulfikar Ghose, with whom he produced a joint collection of stories, Statement Against Corpses. Like Johnson's early stories (at least superficially) his first two novels, Travelling People (1963) and Albert Angelo (1964), at first appear relatively conventional in plot terms. However, the first novel uses several innovative devices and includes a section set out as a film script. The second includes famously cut-through pages to enable the reader to skip forward. His work became progressively even more experimental. The Unfortunates (1969) was published in a box with no binding (readers could assemble the book any way they liked, apart from the chapters marked 'First' and 'Last' which did indicate preferred terminal points). BBC Producer Lorna Pegram employed him to talk about this creation for the TV series Release. With barely any negotiation the interview was ready months before the book was ready for publication. House Mother Normal (1971) was written in purely chronological order such that the various characters' thoughts and experiences would cross each other and become intertwined, not just page by page, but sentence by sentence. He won the Eric Gregory Award in 1962. Johnson led and associated with a loosely constituted circle of \\"experimental\\" authors in Sixties Britain, which included Alan Burns, Eva Figes, Rayner Heppenstall, Ann Quin, Stefan Themerson, and Wilson Harris among others. Many of these figures contributed to London Consequences, a novel consisting of a palimpsest of chapters passed between a range of participating authors and set in London, edited by Margaret Drabble and Johnson. Johnson also made numerous experimental films, published poetry, and wrote reviews, short stories and plays. For many years he was the poetry editor of Transatlantic Review. He is mentioned several times in Paul Theroux's account of his friendship with V. S. Naipaul, Sir Vidia's Shadow.Sir Vidia's Shadow. Death and legacy At the age of 40, increasingly depressed by his failure to succeed commercially, and beset by family problems, Johnson took his own life by slitting his wrists. Johnson was largely unknown to the wider reading public at the time of his death, but has a growing cult following. A critically acclaimed film adaptation of his last novel to appear while he was alive, Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry (1973), was released in 2000. Singer-songwriter Joe Pernice paid tribute to Johnson on the 2006 Pernice Brothers album Live a Little. Jonathan Coe's 2004 biography Like a Fiery Elephant (winner of the 2005 Samuel Johnson Prize) has already led to a renewal of interest in Johnson's work. Coe himself is now a president of the B. S. Johnson Society, which aims \\"to bring closer Johnson scholars, readers and aficionados alike in their various approaches to the author's life and work.\\" In April 2013, the British Film Institute released You're Human Like the Rest of Them, a collection of Johnson's films, as part of the BFI Flipside DVD series.Citation required In 2015, Five Leaves Bookshop in Nottingham held an event called \\"But I Know This City!\\" based around Johnson's novel The Unfortunates, set in Nottingham, which allowed participants to travel around the city and listen to live readings of the novel's sections in whichever order they chose.

Early life and education Raised and educated in Cap-Pel√©, New Brunswick, Richard earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Moncton and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick. Political career He first entered politics as a young man, running unsuccessfully in Shediac for the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick as a Parti Acadien candidate in the 1974 election. He became involved in municipal politics in the village of Cap-P√©l√©. His second entry into provincial politics was in the 1991 election, this time as a Liberal. He won. He was re-elected in 1995, 1999 and 2003. He was named to cabinet in 1995 and left in 1998 to contest the leadership of the Liberal Party. He was unsuccessful in his leadership bid and was returned to the cabinet position by Camille Th√©riault who was the victor in the contest. Richard managed to be re-election by the largest margin of any candidate in the 1999 election, despite the fact that his party suffering a massive defeat. When Th√©riault resigned as leader in 2001, Richard briefly considered another run but instead became interim leader. When Shawn Graham became leader in 2002, Richard was made House Leader and finance critic, two key roles in the opposition. Richard maintained these roles after the 2003 election. The Progressive Conservative government of Bernard Lord had won a bare majority in 2003, winning 28 of 55 seats and were anxious to strengthen their position. After first attempting to convince a Liberal to sit as speaker and then offering cabinet positions and other appointments to several Liberals, Richard accepted the post of provincial ombudsman, thus resigning his seat and increasing the Tory majority to 28/54 for the ensuing year before a by- election was held.

The station's two exits are located between College Road and Lowlands Road in the town centre of Harrow, about half a mile north of the locality from which it takes its name. Railway geography The station is a major junction with numerous crossovers north and south of station enabling flexibility when routing trains. South of the station there are four LU tracks paired by direction as \\"Fast\\" and \\"Local\\" lines to/from Baker Street and two \\"Main line\\" tracks to/from Marylebone. North of the station, the Uxbridge branch diverges from the other routes by means of a borrowing junction. Above this, Harrow North Junction separates the \\"Local line\\" towards North Harrow and the \\"Main line\\" towards Moor Park. London Underground London Underground services at Harrow-on-the-Hill are provided by the Metropolitan line. The adjacent Underground stations are Northwick Park (all stations southbound), Moor Park (fast northbound), North Harrow (all stations northbound) and West Harrow (towards Uxbridge) The Metropolitan line is unique in operating an express service. \\"Fast\\" and \\"Semi- fast\\" services (now mostly reserved for peak times) do not stop between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Finchley Road. The \\"Fast\\" lines at stations between Moor Park, Harrow and Wembley Park have no platforms. Southbound services go to either Baker Street (4tph) or continue beyond to the line's terminus at Aldgate (12tph). Off-peak trains from Amersham (2tph), Chesham (2tph) and Uxbridge (8tph) generally terminate at Aldgate, with a 4tph service from Watford to Baker Street, however during peak hours trains from all branches go to/from all destinations. =History= The station was opened as \\"Harrow\\" on 2 August 1880, when the Metropolitan Railway was extended from its previous terminus at Willesden Green. Its name was changed to \\"Harrow-on-the-Hill\\" on 1 June 1894. Like some other Underground stations, the name is an example of marketing rather than precision; in this case the town \\"proper\\" of the same name is at the top of Harrow Hill, while the station is located at the foot of the hill to the north, which was at the time of opening was a small hamlet called Greenhill and has since become the main town proper of Harrow. Had the governors of Harrow School not made objections during the planning stage, it is possible that the Metropolitan Railway might have followed a different route taking it closer to the town centre on the hill. The station is at the heart of Metro-land. National Rail The National Rail service at Harrow-on- the-Hill is provided by Chiltern Railways. Services operate between Marylebone station and Aylesbury using the separate Network Rail tracks from London to Harrow and sharing London Underground tracks between Harrow and Amersham. Chiltern Railways started operating in 1996 after the privatisation of British Rail and typically provide two trains per hour between Aylesbury and London via Harrow. =History= This service began as the Great Central Railway (GCR) on 15 March 1899. The GCR ran on the former Great Central Main Line, an intercity trunk route and provided services from Harrow to destinations such as Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham and Manchester. The passenger service north of Aylesbury ceased in 1966 due to the Beeching Axe. There was a goods yard, which closed on 3 April 1967. Station layout The station building is above ground with the six platforms in a cutting. Two (on the South side) are predominantly used by NR services and the other four by the Metropolitan line; the NR platforms are electrified with the LU system (normal services are operated by diesel trains) and incoming LU trains on some routes can be diverted into them should this be necessary during closures of tracks in the area. The station has two entrances, one on Station Approach (leading to Lowlands Road and Harrow Hill) and one on College Road (for the adjacent Harrow Bus Station and the main shopping area). During opening hours the Station is popular as a shortcut, removing the longer walk via the bridge at Station Road, as it is possible to walk through the ticket office area without passing through the ticket gates. The present main station building replaced older structures at the London end of the platforms (thus leaving Station Road with no station); it consists of a main circulating area built across all tracks with stairs down to all platforms and both street entrances thus requiring a number of steps to be negotiated by all users. A pedestrian tunnel connected all the platforms to the adjacent and now closed Post Office sorting office, whose site is now subject to a major redevelopment. A new office block called Avanta House was built in the 1980s or early 1990s on top of the station's College Road entrance.  Step-free access  Harrow-on-the-Hill is due to gain step free access via College Road as part of the tranche of stations due for completion in 2020. Bus Station There is a bus station located next to the station offering London Buses services right across North London.

He was a member of an illustrious family, his brother Ricardo was a painter, writer and engraver, and his nephew Julio Caro Baroja, son of his younger sister Carmen, was a well-known anthropologist.

Roberts ‚Äì 1979 \\"His father was the author of the first Basque opera and of popular songs in the Basque language.\\" The young Baroja studied medicine at Valencia and took a medical degree at the Complutense University in Madrid at 21. Although educated as a physician, Baroja practiced only briefly. His memories of student life became the raw material for his novel The Tree of Knowledge. He also managed the family bakery for a short time, running unsuccessfully on two occasions for a seat at the Cortes Generales (the Spanish parliament) as a Radical Republican. Baroja's true calling, however, was always writing, which he began seriously at the age of 13. Baroja's first novel, La casa de Aizgorri (The House of Aizgorri, 1900), is part of a trilogy called La Tierra Vasca (The Basque Country, 1900‚Äì1909). This trilogy also includes El Mayorazgo de Labraz (The Lord of Labraz, 1903), which became one of his most popular novels in Spain. Baroja is best known internationally for another trilogy, La lucha por la vida (The Struggle for Life, 1922‚Äì1924), which offers a vivid depiction of life in Madrid's slums. John Dos Passos greatly admired these works and wrote about them. Another major work, Memorias de un Hombre de Acci√≥n (Memories of a Man of Action, 1913‚Äì1931), offers a depiction of one of his ancestors who lived in the Basque region during the Carlist uprising in the 19th century. Another of Baroja's trilogies is called La mar (The sea) and comprises La estrella del capit√°n Chimista, Los Pilotos de altura and Los mercaderes de esclavos. Baroja also wrote the biography of Juan Van Halen, a Spanish military adventurer. Baroja's masterpiece is considered to be El √°rbol de la ciencia (1911) (translated as The Tree of Knowledge), a pessimistic Bildungsroman that depicts the futility of the pursuit of knowledge and of life in general. The title is symbolic: the more the chief protagonist, Andres Hurtado, learns about and experiences life, the more pessimistic he feels and the more futile his life seems. In keeping with Spanish literary tradition, Baroja often wrote in a pessimistic, picaresque style. His deft portrayal of the characters and settings brought the Basque region to life much as Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s's works offered an insight into Madrid. Baroja's works were often lively but could be lacking in plot. They are written in an abrupt, vivid, yet impersonal style. He was accused of grammatical errors, which he never denied. While young, Baroja believed loosely in anarchism, like others in the '98 Generation. He later admired men of action, similar to Nietzsche's superman. Catholics and traditionalists denounced him, and his life was at risk during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). In Youth And Egolatry (1917), Baroja described his beliefs as follows: > I have always been a liberal radical, an individualist and an anarchist. In > the first place, I am an enemy of the Church; in the second place, I am an > enemy of the State. When these great powers are in conflict I am a partisan > of the State as against the Church, but on the day of the State's triumph, I > shall become an enemy of the State. If I had lived during the French > Revolution, I should have been an internationalist of the school of > Anacharsis Cloots; during the struggle for liberty, I should have been one > of the Carbonieri. Ernest Hemingway was greatly influenced by Baroja and told him when he visited him in October 1956, \\"Allow me to pay this small tribute to you who taught so much to those of us who wanted to be writers when we were young. I deplore the fact that you have not yet received a Nobel Prize, especially when it was given to so many who deserved it less, like me, who am only an adventurer.\\" Baroja died shortly after this visit and was buried in the Civil Cemetery of Madrid.

The station is on the Metropolitan line between Harrow-on-the- Hill (southbound) and Pinner (northbound). Fast Metropolitan line and Chiltern Railways services pass by using two of the four tracks. It has won Transport for London awards for best customer service in 2009 and 2010. History The Metropolitan Railway began running services through here on 25 May 1885 with the opening of its Pinner extension. North Harrow station opened on 22 March 1915. The station was rebuilt in 1930 to the designs of Charles Clark as part of the Metropolitan Railway's modernisation programme. Currently the art on display are photocopied pictures of local people painted over with coloured paint in various places, made by a local disabled children's group. It has two main exits but in recent years only one is in use, towards the town centre, presumably due to setup of the barriers not requiring both. There is a direct door into a neighbouring florist. The area under the railway bridge outside the exit to the station is prone to flooding at times due to its low-lying position. Services In the northbound direction the station is served by trains to Watford (4tph), Amersham (2tph) and Chesham (2tph) trains (at peak times, 'fast' trains do not stop at stations between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Moor Park). In the southbound direction off-peak services generally run 4tph to Baker Street and 4tph to Aldgate. Connections London Buses routes H9 and H10 serve the station.

It is the district town of the district Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim. History In 741, for the first time, Riedfeld, the town's root settlement, was documented as the German king's court. However, in 1285 the town's name is documented for the first time as \\"Nivenstadt\\". At the end of the 12th century, Neustadt became part of the sovereign territory of the burgraves of Nuremberg, the dynasty of the Hohenzollern. The House of Hohenzollern developed Neustadt into an economical, political and also cultural centre of its region, mainly because of its favourable geographical position in the middle of the main trade route between W√ºrzburg and Nuremberg. At the end of the 15th century, Margrave Albrecht Achilles and Kurf√ºrstin (Electress) Anna completed Neustadt as a stronghold. In 1553, in the Second Margrave War, the town was burnt down. Afterwards, a long lasting phase of construction and extension began. This phase ended with the destructions of the Thirty Years' War. The rebuilding after that war lasted several hundred of years. From 1791 through to 1806, Neustadt was part of the sovereign territory of Prussia, then was military governed by the French, and in 1810 became finally part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The political importance of Neustadt faded thereafter, but trade and industry kept growing due to the deployment of a garrison of the Uhlans, and in 1865 due to the opening of its station on the Nuremberg‚ÄìW√ºrzburg Railway. In 1934, the town was the scene of an organized boycott against all Jewish merchants, and violence broke out against Christian Germans who patronized stores owned by Jews. Ultimately all of the Jews of Neustadt were expelled, many relocating to Nuremberg, and the Jewish synagogue was razed to the ground. During the 20th century, traditional handicrafts (like brush-makers and makers of drawing instruments) almost completely vanished. With the resettlement of expellees from Sudetenland, new handicraft industries were imported: construction of musical instruments and the textile industry flourished. From 1969 through to 1980, in total 16 Ortsteile were incorporated. In the course of an administrative reorganization (Gebietsreform), Neustadt became capital of the newly formed district \\"Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim\\". In the 1980s and 1990s, the infrastructure was improved on a grand scale: a beltway was built, and a pedestrian area around the market place was created; the cultural program was extended, and the old town was rehabilitated; new residential zones and business parks were established.

He is recognised internationally for his contributions to science while working under Ernest Rutherford, which led to the discovery of new theories on the structure of the atom. In Marsden's later work in New Zealand, he became a significant member of the scientific community, while maintaining close links to the United Kingdom. Education Born in Manchester, the son of Thomas Marsden and Phoebe Holden, Marsden lived in Rishton and attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Blackburn, where an inter-house trophy rewarding academic excellence ('The Marsden Merit Trophy') bears his name. In 1909, as a 20-year-old student at the University of Manchester, he met and began work under Ernest Rutherford.Rebecca Priestley, 'Ernest Marsden, 18889-1970', in Veronika Meduna and Rebecca Priestley (eds.), Atoms, Dinosaurs and DNA:68 Great New Zealand Scientists (Random House New Zealand: Auckland, 2008), pp.54-55 While still an undergraduate he conducted the famous Geiger‚ÄìMarsden experiment, also called the gold foil experiment, together with Hans Geiger under Rutherford's supervision. This experiment led to Rutherford's new theory for the structure of the atom, with a centralised concentration of mass and positive charge surrounded by empty space and a sea of orbiting negatively charged electrons.Rebecca Priestley, 'Ernest Marsden's Nuclear New Zealand: From Nuclear Reactors to Nuclear Disarmament', Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, Vol.139, 2006, p.24 Rutherford later described this as \\"almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back to hit you\\".Ernest Rutherford, 'The Development of the Theory of Atomic Structure', in Joseph Needham and Walter Pagel, Background to Modern Science (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1938), p.68 The apparatus used in the experiment was an early version of what was to become the Geiger counter.Heilbron, John L (2003) Ernest Rutherford and the Explosion of Atoms p.59, Oxford University Press. . In 1915 he moved to Victoria University College in Wellington, New Zealand, to replace Thomas Laby as Professor of Physics; Rutherford recommended his appointment there. Career Marsden served in France during World War I as a Royal Engineer in a special sound-ranging section and earned the Military Cross. In 1922 Marsden turned from his research and position as Professor of Physics to bureaucracy. He was appointed Assistant Director of Education before accepting the position of Secretary of New Zealand's new Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in 1926. The new Department's focus was on assisting primary industries, and Marsden worked to organise research particularly in the area of agriculture. Marsden initiated a number of projects that kept New Zealand in touch with international developments in the field of radiation and nuclear sciences. In 1939 he pioneered the non-medical use of radioisotopes in New Zealand, and conducted a series of experiments to determine the role of cobalt in animal metabolism. With the outbreak of World War II Marsden was given the title of Director of Scientific Developments, and was charged with mobilizing New Zealand's scientific manpower.Rebecca Priestley, 'Ernest Marsden's Nuclear New Zealand: From Nuclear Reactors to Nuclear Disarmament', Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, Vol.139, 2006, p.25 During the War he worked on radar research, setting up a team to develop the radar equipment for use in the Pacific. Marsden also used his scientific connections to form a team of young New Zealand Scientists who would participate in the American Manhattan Project developing the nuclear bomb, and initiated the search for uranium, the raw material needed for nuclear projects, in New Zealand.Rebecca Priestley, Mad on Radium: New Zealand in the Atomic Age (Auckland University Press: Auckland, 2012) Marsden had a post-war vision of a nuclear New Zealand, with scientists working on research using local nuclear reactors, and developing connections with the British nuclear energy and weapons program. While this vision was not fully realised, in 1946 he established a team of scientists to carry out research into atomic energy and the application of nuclear science to problems in agriculture, health, and industry. Ties between Marsden and the scientific community in Britain remained strong, and in 1947 he became the DSIR's scientific liaison officer in London. Marsden retired in 1954 and returned to Wellington, where he continued to work and travel extensively, serving on a number of committees and conducting research into environmental radioactivity. As his studies turned to the impact of fallout from radioactive bombs, Marsden came to oppose testing and the development of nuclear weapons. While Marsden had a significant role in establishing and encouraging nuclear science in New Zealand, this role of speaking out against nuclear weapons development and testing - which he only did after the British nuclear testing program was complete - is less known. In 1966, the same year France began testing nuclear bombs in the Pacific, Marsden suffered a stroke which left him confined to a wheelchair. He later died at his home in Lowry Bay, Lower Hutt on the shores of Wellington Harbour in 1970. Family life Marsden married Margaret Sutcliffe, a school teacher, in 1913. They had two children together, a son and a daughter. After Marsden's final retirement to New Zealand, Maggie (who had been suffering from heart disease) died on 7 November 1956. Two years later Marsden remarried, and on 26 June 1958 Joyce Winifred Chote, who was 30 years his junior, became his wife. She assisted him in his remaining years, joining him on his travels and supporting him during his research.Ross Galbreath, 'Marsden, Ernest', from The Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Te Ara, the Encyclopedia of New Zealand Honours and awards Marsden's career recognitions included fellowship in the Royal Society of London in 1946, president of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1947 and the Rutherford Memorial Lecture in 1948. In 1961 he chaired the Rutherford Jubilee Conference in Manchester, which celebrated 50 years since Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Silver Jubilee and King's Birthday Honours. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1946 New Year Honours and a Knight Bachelor in the 1958 New Year Honours, for services to science.

He was the Spanish ambassador to England in London (1931-1936) and voluntarily exiled himself to Argentina via France because of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Background P√©rez de Ayala was educated at Jesuit schools, the experience of which he satirized in the novel A.M.D.G. (1910). The novelist Leopoldo Alas was among his professors, and Alas's \\"intellectual novel,\\" focused on ideas and philosophy, would influence P√©rez de Ayala's own fiction. There is some debate regarding to which generation of Spanish writers P√©rez de Ayala belongs. His early realistic novels reveal ties with the Generation of 98. However, some argue that Ramon P√©rez de Ayala was a member of the Generation of 1914, a group which did not entirely fit with either the Generation of 98 or the Generation of 27. Like his political ally Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, he was a liberal republican and opposed to the Spanish monarchy, as well as a professed Anglophile who sought to import the English parliamentary system to Spain. He was elected to the Royal Spanish Academy in 1928, and received nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1931, 1934 and 1947. He was appointed director of the Prado Museum in 1931 a position that he left temporarily in 1932 to become the Spanish ambassador to Britain. Perez de Ayala received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1936. He was succeeded as director of the Prado Museum by Pablo Picasso in 1936. After 1916, his novels became increasingly mature and lyrical, his characters becoming symbolic representatives of general human problems. To this period belongs his masterpieces, Belarmino y Apolonio (1921) (translated as \\"Belarmino and Apolonio\\"), Tiger Juan (1926) and El curandero de su honra (The Healer of his Honour) (1927). La paz del sendero (The Peace of the Path) (1903), El sendero innumerable (1916), and El sendero andante (1921), his major poetic works, show the influence of French symbolism. He also wrote satiric essays and dramatic criticism.

Born in Rome, Pier Luigi was the illegitimate son of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (who later became Pope Paul III). He became a soldier and participated in the sack of Rome in 1527. Youth Pier Luigi Alexander Farnese was born in 1503 from the union between Cardinal Alexander Farnese (future Pope Paul III) and probably Silvia Ruffini - a Roman noblewoman who also gave birth with Alexander to three other children: Constanza, Paul and Ranuccio. His illegitimacy tormented Pier Luigi all his life, and doubtless contributed to the formation of his character. The nobility of Piacenza was frequently known to insult him as \\"the bastard son of the Pope.\\" As the eldest and beloved son he was legitimised along with his brother Paul at the age of two in 1505 by Pope Julius II.Williams, George L. \\"Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes\\". McFarland & Co Inc, 2004. 76. He was given a famous humanist tutor, Baldassarre Malosso di Casalmaggiore, nicknamed \\"Tranquillus,\\" and quickly developed a love of war and fortifications. Alexander was, however, keen to make Pier Luigi the true head of the Farnese family and so arranged a favourable marriage alliance with Gerolama (also known by the spelling Girolama) Orsini, daughter of Lodovico, Count of Pitigliano. In 1513 the engagement contract was drawn up, and in 1519 the wedding celebrated. Despite a loveless marriage, Gerolama remained a faithful devoted wife, tolerating Pier Luigi's excesses, brutality, and extravagances with dignity. Delays in the construction at the palace in Gradoli, meant the young couple had to lodge in the Castle at Valentano. The following year their first son Alexander was born.Giovanni Drei, I Farnese, Parma, 1950 Military career Castel Sant'Angelo, Rome Pier Luigi Farnese quickly became the stereotype of a mercenary soldier: wild and amoral. He had courage and daring and while strong and audacious was also sufficiently brutal to offend many observers. Nor did he always fight on the traditional side of the papacy; reversing the pro-Guelph sentiments of the Farnese. In 1520, at the age of seventeen, he and his brother Ranuccio were already employed as mercenaries in the pay of the Republic of Venice. As a result, he served under the standard of Charles V - remaining with the emperor until 1527, he was present at the Sack of Rome of that year, in which he took part. While his brother Ranuccio withdrew to Castel Sant'Angelo to defend the Pope; Pier Luigi crossed the Tiber and quartered his men in the family palace, thus saving it from destruction. Critics accused the Farnese of backing both sides, but Pope Clement VII refused to condemn him. Finally when the plague hit the city, the imperial troops decided to withdraw. Pier Luigi withdrew from Rome into the Roman countryside, taxing it without mercy and permitting a climate of theft and murder. Pope Clement, tired of this behaviour, eventually threatened him with excommunication, until Cardinal Alexander tried diplomatically to reconcile his son with the pope. In 1528 Pier Luigi, still under imperial pay, fought in Apulia against the French army and distinguished himself in the defence of Manfredonia. =Captain General of the Church= Basilica of San Gaudenzio, Novara When his father was elevated to the papacy as Paul III in 1534, great festivities were celebrated at Valentano, after which Pier Luigi left for Rome. Paul's first action was to make Pier Luigi's eldest son, Alessandro Farnese, a cardinal. But Charles V only reluctantly allowed the granting of titles to Pier Luigi over the city of Novara, agreeing an annual pension on the condition that the news was not made public. In the hope of speeding things up, Pier Luigi took direct part in the negotiations while leading troops into the lands occupied by his Farnese relatives. Novara and its surrounding territory was finally established as a marquessate in favour of Pier Luigi, but had to wait until February 1538 until formal investiture could be made. In the meantime the office of Captain General of the Church had become vacant, and Paul nominated his son on 31 January 1537. Pier Luigi travelled through the Papal States defeating pockets of resistance before arriving in triumph at Piacenza. =Duke of Castro= Meanwhile, Paul III gradually recovered the family lands around Castro which had been split after the death of Ranuccio the Elder.Knight, Charles. \\"Farnese\\", Biography: Or, Third Division of \\"The English Encyclopedia\\", Vol. 2, 1867 To this he added the territory of Ronciglione. Pier Luigi was invested with the titles of \\"Montalto\\" which gave the right to export grain without paying taxes; and Paul accepted feudal rights over Canine, Gradoli, Valentano, Latera and Marta. He exchanged the city of Frascati for the fortress at Castro, and at bought Bisenzio from the diocese of Montefiascone. As a final act, Paul created a formal duchy out of the lands and bestowed it upon his son and heirs. The duchy was, however, to come under the direct control of the Holy See. The Duchy of Castro operated as a functioning State within the Patrimony of Saint Peter. It possessed rich forests full of game, fertile vineyards and fields, and a great number of fortresses. In the consistory of 14 March 1537, the Pope also awarded his son the cities of Nepi and Ronciglione. Pier Luigi was tasked with repairing all the fortresses over which he was now feudal lord. The new Duke commissioned Antonio da Sangallo the Younger to create a new capital, which saw the construction of a citadel, ducal palace and mint. During his life Pier Luigi gained a certain reputation for cruelty, ruthlessness and decadence. A particular scandal erupted in 1537, when he was accused of what became known as the 'rape of Fano', where he allegedly raped the young bishop of the city, Cosimo Gheri, while marching with his troops (Gheri subsequently died).Dall'Orto, G., 'Un avo poco presentabile', Babilonia, 162, January 1998 In 1538 his son Ottavio married Margaret of Parma, an illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V; thus consolidating the friendship between the Farnese and the imperial family. In 1543 another son, Orazio, was sent to France and eventually married Diane de France - an illegitimate daughter of Henry II of France. Finally in 1545 his third son, Ranuccio, was created a cardinal by Paul III. View of Castro (1663). =Duke of Parma and Piacenza= Paul III then went on to make Pier Luigi Duke of Parma and Piacenza, properties that had previously been a part of the Papal States. Pier Luigi and his son, Ottavio, declared they would pay 9,000 golden ducati every year to the treasury of the Holy See, and, in exchange, they gave back the Duchies of Camerino and Nepi. Pier Luigi took possession of his new states on 23 September 1546. =Conspiracy and death= His firm rule and his taxes gained him the enmities of the cities, which were used to the fair authority of the Popes. The aristocracy, in particular, was supported against him by emperor Charles V, who aimed to unite Parma and Piacenza to the Duchy of Milan. It was Ferrante Gonzaga the governor of Milan who, having learned that Charles wanted to take possession of the cities, decided to launch a plot against the Farnese. Ferrante began to spy on Pier Luigi and sent reports continually to Madrid. Pier Luigi did not remain passive; on 4 June 1547 he arranged the marriage of his daughter, Vittoria, with Guidobaldo II della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino. He also continued to work hard on the fortifications of his lands. Charles, concerned about the progress of work in Parma, was persuaded to give free rein to Ferrante to organize a conspiracy against the duke. Marquis Pallavicini Cortemaggiore offered support; but Ferrante preferred to rely on his distant kinsman Louis Gonzaga, Lord of Castiglione, and his brother Count Giovanni Anguissola, governor of Como. Anguissola was able to convince Count Agostino Landi, Marquis Giovan Luigi Confalonieri, and Girolamo Alessandro Pallavicini to join him. After Anguissola and others had stabbed him to death, the conspirators hung his body from a window of his palace in Piacenza. Charles V's vicar Ferrante Gonzaga captured the Duchy soon after,Dyer, Thomas Henry. Modern Europe 1521-1598, G. Bell & Sons, 1877 although subsequent events led to the return of the duchy to Pier-Luigi's son, Ottavio in 1551. Following the death of his son, Pope Paul met in consistory and had Ferrante accused of the murder - declaring that Ottavio would succeed his father as the new duke and the new Gonfalonier of the Church. Pier Luigi's body was brought back and buried in Piacenza; later the body was transported to Parma by his wife Gerolama Orsini and then to the family tomb on the island of Bisentina on Lake Bolsena.

Pier Luigi Farnese had married Girolama Orsini, daughter of Luigi Orsini and wife and first cousin Giulia Conti and paternal granddaughter of the 6th Counts of Pitigliano.

Both the singular form Get and plural Getae may be derived from a Greek exonym: the area was the hinterland of Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast, bringing the Getae into contact with the ancient Greeks from an early date. Although it is believed that the Getae were related to their westward neighbours, the Dacians, several scholars, especially in the Romanian historiography, posit that the Getae and the Dacians were the same people. Ethnonym The ethnonym Getae was first used by Herodotus. The root was also used for the Tyragetae, Thyssagetae, Massagetae, and others.  Getae and Dacians  = Ancient sources = Beaker with birds and animals, Thraco-Getian, 4th century BC, silver, height: , Metropolitan Museum of Art Strabo, one of the first ancient sources to mention Getae and Dacians, stated in his Geographica ( 7BC ‚Äì 20AD) that the Dacians lived in the western parts of Dacia, \\"towards Germania and the sources of the Danube\\", while the Getae lived in the eastern parts, towards the Black Sea, both south and north of the Danube. The ancient geographer also wrote that the Dacians and Getae spoke the same language, after stating the same about Getae and Thracians. Pliny the Elder, in his Naturalis Historia (Natural History), c.77‚Äì79AD, stated something similar: \\"... though various races have occupied the adjacent shores; at one spot the Getae, by the Romans called Daci\\". Appian, who began writing his Roman History under Antoninus Pius, Roman Emperor from 138 to 161, noted: \\"[B]ut going beyond these rivers in places they rule some of the Celts over the Rhine and the Getae over the Danube, whom they call Dacians\\". Justin, the 3rd century AD Latin historian, wrote in his Epitome of Pompeius Trogus that Dacians are spoken of as descendants of the Getae: \\"Daci quoque suboles Getarum sunt\\" (The Dacians as well are a scion of the Getae). In his Roman History (c.200AD), Cassius Dio added: \\"I call the people Dacians, the name used by the natives themselves as well as by the Romans, though I am not ignorant that some Greek writers refer to them as Getae, whether that is the right term or not...\\". He also said the Dacians lived on both sides of the Lower Danube; the ones south of the river (today's northern Bulgaria), in Moesia, were called Moesians, while the ones north of the river were called Dacians. He argued that the Dacians are \\"Getae or Thracians of Dacian race\\":Cassius Dio. Roman History, 55.22.6-55.22.7. \\"The Suebi, to be exact, dwell beyond the Rhine (though many people elsewhere claim their name), and the Dacians on both sides of the Ister; those of the latter, however, who live on this side of the river near the country of the Triballi are reckoned in with the district of Moesia and are called Moesians, except by those living in the immediate neighbourhood, while those on the other side are called Dacians and are either a branch of the Getae are Thracians belonging to the Dacian race that once inhabited Rhodope.\\" = Modern interpretations = There is a dispute among scholars about the relations between the Getae and Dacians, and this dispute also covers the interpretation of ancient sources. Some historians such as Ronald Arthur Crossland state that even Ancient Greeks used the two designations \\"interchangeable or with some confusion\\". Thus, it is generally considered that the two groups were related to a certain degree, J. J. Wilkes mentions \\"the Getae of the Dobrudja, who were akin to the Dacians\\"; (p. 562) the exact relation is a matter of controversy.  Same people  Onomastic range of the Dacian, Getae, and Moesian towns with the dava or deva ending, covering Dacia, Moesia, Thrace, and Dalmatia, and showcasing linguistic continuity Strabo, as well as other ancient sources, led some modern historians to consider that, if the Thracian ethnic group should be divided, one of this divisions should be the \\"Daco-Getae\\". See p. 364, n. 41: \\"If there is any justification for dividing the Thracian ethnic group, then, unlike V. Georgiev who suggests splitting it into the Thraco-Getae and the Daco-Mysi, I consider a division into the Thraco-Mysi and the Daco-Getae the more likely.\\" The linguist Ivan Duridanov also identified a \\"Dacian linguistic area\\" in Dacia, Scythia Minor, Lower Moesia, and Upper Moesia. Romanian scholars generally went further with the identification, historian Constantin C. Giurescu claiming the two were identical. \\"They (Dacians and Getae) are two names for the same people [...] divided in a large number of tribes\\". See also the hypothesis of a Daco-Moesian language / dialectal area supported by linguists like Vladimir Georgiev, Ivan Duridanov and Sorin Olteanu. The archaeologist Mircea Babe»ô spoke of a \\"veritable ethno-cultural unity\\" between the Getae and the Dacians. According to Glanville Price, the account of the Greek geographer Strabo shows that the Getae and the Dacians were one and the same people., p. 120 Others who support the identity between Getae and Dacians with ancient sources include freelance writer James Minahan and Catherine B Avery, who claim the people whom the Greek called Getae were called Daci by the Romans. This same belief is stated by some British historians such as David Sandler Berkowitz and Philip Matyszak. The Bulgarian historian and thracologist Alexander Fol considers that the Getae became known as \\"Dacians\\" in Greek and Latin in the writings of Caesar, Strabo and Pliny the Elder, as Roman observers adopted the name of the Dacian tribe to refer to all the unconquered inhabitants north of the Danube. Also, Edward Bunbury believed the name of Getae, by which they were originally known to the Greeks on the Euxine, was always retained by the latter in common usage: while that of Dacians, whatever be its origin, was that by which the more western tribes, adjoining the Pannonians, first became known to the Romans. Some scholars consider the Getae and Dacians to be the same people at different stages of their history and discuss their culture as Geto-Dacian.  Same language, distinct people  Historian and archaeologist Alexandru Vulpe found a remarkable uniformity of the Geto-Dacian culture, however he is one of the few Romanian archaeologists to make a clear distinction between the Getae and Dacians, arguing against the traditional position of the Romanian historiography that considered the two people the same. Nevertheless, he chose to use the term \\"Geto-Dacians\\" as a conventional concept for the Thracian tribes inhabiting the future territory of Romania, not necessarily meaning an \\"absolute ethnic, linguistic or historical unity\\". Ronald Arthur Crossland suggested the two designations may refer to two groups of a \\"linguistically homogeneous people\\" that had come to historical prominence at two distinct periods of time. He also compared the probable linguistic situation with the relation between modern Norwegian and Danish languages. In chapter \\"20c Linguistic problems of the Balkan area\\", at page 838, Ronald Arthur Crossland argues \\"it may be the distinction made by Greeks and Romans between the Getae and Daci, for example, reflected the importance of different sections of a linguistically homogenous people at different times\\". He furthermore recalls Strabo's testimony and Georgiev's hypothesis for a 'Thraco-Dacian' language. Paul Lachlan MacKendrick considered the two as \\"branches\\" of the same tribe, speaking two dialects of a common language. \\"The natives with whom we shall be concerned in this chapter are the Getae of Muntenia and Moldavia in the eastern steppes, and the Dacians of the Carpathian Mountains. Herodotus calls them 'the bravest and the justest of the Thracians,' and they were in fact two branches of the same tribe, speaking two dialects of the same Indo-European language.\\" (p. 45) The Romanian historian of ideas and historiographer Lucian Boia stated: \\"At a certain point, the phrase Geto-Dacian was coined in the Romanian historiography to suggest a unity of Getae and Dacians\\". Lucian Boia took a sceptical position, arguing the ancient writers distinguished among the two people, treating them as two distinct groups of the Thracian ethnos. Boia contended that it would be naive to assume Strabo knew the Thracian dialects so well, alleging that Strabo had \\"no competence in the field of Thracian dialects\\". The latter claim is contested, some studies attesting Strabo's reliability and sources. The author concluded Strabo's claim sums an experience following of many centuries of neighbourhood and cultural interferences between the Greeks and the Thracian tribes There is no reason to disregard Strabo's belief that the Daci and the Getae spoke the same language. Boia also stressed that some Romanian authors cited Strabo indiscriminately. A similar position was adopted by Romanian historian and archaeologist G. A. Niculescu, who also criticized the Romanian historiography and the archaeological interpretation, particularly on the \\"Geto-Dacian\\" culture. He dedicates a large part of his assessment to the archaeology of \\"Geto-Dacians\\" and he concludes that with few exceptions \\"the archaeological interpretations [...] are following G. Kossinna‚Äôs concepts of culture, archaeology and ethnicity\\". In his opinion, Alexandru Vulpe saw ancient people as modern nations, leading the latter to interpret the common language as a sign of a common people, despite Strabo making a distinction between the two.  History  Eastern Europe in 200BC showing the Getae tribes north of the Danube river = 7th ‚Äì 4th century BC = From the 7th century BC onwards, the Getae came into economic and cultural contact with the Greeks, who were establishing colonies on the western side of Pontus Euxinus, nowadays the Black Sea. The Getae are mentioned for the first time together in Herodotus in his narrative of the Scythian campaign of Darius I in 513BC, during which the latter conquered the Getae.The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 10 - Persia, Greece, and the Western Mediterranean Cambridge University Press, 1982. p 494 According to Herodotus, the Getae differed from other Thracian tribes in their religion, centered around the god (daimon) Zalmoxis whom some of the Getae called Gebeleizis.Herodotus. Histories, 4.93‚Äì4.97. Between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC, the Getae were mostly under the rule of the flourishing Odrysian kingdom. During this time, the Getae provided military services and became famous for their cavalry. After the disintegration of the Odrysian kingdom, smaller Getic principalities began to consolidate themselves. = Prosperity = Before setting out on his Persian expedition, Alexander the Great defeated the Getae and razed one of their settlements.Arrian. Anabasis, Book IA. \\"The Getae did not sustain even the first charge of the cavalry; for Alexander‚Äôs audacity seemed incredible to them, in having thus easily crossed the Ister, the largest of rivers, in a single night, without throwing a bridge over the stream. Terrible to them also was the closely locked order of the phalanx, and violent the charge of the cavalry. At first they fled for refuge into their city, which was distant about a parasang from the Ister; but when they saw that Alexander was leading his phalanx carefully along the side of the river, to prevent his infantry being anywhere surrounded by the Getae lying in ambush, but that he was sending his cavalry straight on, they again abandoned the city, because it was badly fortified.\\" In 313BC, the Getae formed an alliance with Callatis, Odessos, and other western Pontic Greek colonies against Lysimachus, who held a fortress at Tirizis (modern Kaliakra).Strabo. Geography, 7.6.1. \\"On this coast-line is Cape Tirizis, a stronghold, which Lysimachus once used as a treasury.\\" The Getae flourished especially in the first half of the 3rd century BC. By about 200BC, the authority of the Getic prince, Zalmodegicus, stretched as far as Histria, as a contemporary inscription shows.Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 18.288 Other strong princes included Zoltes and Rhemaxos (about 180BC). Also, several Getic rulers minted their own coins. The ancient authors StraboStrabo. Geography, 16.2.38‚Äì16.2.39. and Cassius DioCassius Dio. Roman History, 68.9. say that Getae practiced ruler cult, and this is confirmed by archaeological remains. = Conflict with Rome = In 72‚Äì71 BC Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus became the first Roman commander to march against the Getae. This was done to strike at the western Pontic allies of Mithridates VI, but he had limited success. A decade later, a coalition of Scythians, Getae, Bastarnae and Greek colonists defeated C.Antonius Hybrida at Histria.Livy. Ab urbe condita, 103.Cassius Dio. Roman History, 38.10.1‚Äì38.10.3. This victory over the Romans allowed Burebista, the leader of this coalition, to dominate the region for a short period (60‚Äì50 BC). In the mid-first century BC Burebista organized a kingdom consisting of descendants of those whom the Greeks had called Getae, as well as Dacians, or Daci, the name applied to people of the region by the Romans. Augustus aimed at subjugating the entire Balkan peninsula, and used an incursion of the Bastarnae across the Danube as a pretext to devastate the Getae and Thracians. He put Marcus Licinius Crassus in charge of the plan. In 29BC, Crassus defeated the Bastarnae with the help of the Getic prince Rholes.Cassius Dio. Roman History, 52.24.7; 26.1. Crassus promised him help for his support against the Getic ruler Dapyx.Cassius Dio. Roman History, 51.26. After Crassus had reached as far the Danube Delta, Rholes was appointed king and returned to Rome. In 16BC, the Sarmatae invaded the Getic territory and were driven back by Roman troops.Cassius Dio. Roman History, 54.20.1‚Äì54.20.3. The Getae were placed under the control of the Roman vassal king in Thrace, Rhoemetalces I. In 6AD, the province of Moesia was founded, incorporating the Getae south of the Danube River. The Getae north of the Danube continued tribal autonomy outside the Roman Empire.  Culture  According to Herodotus, the Getae were \\"the noblest as well as the most just of all the Thracian tribes\\".Herodotus. Histories, 4.93. When the Persians, led by Darius the Great, campaigned against the Scythians, the Thracian tribes in the Balkans surrendered to Darius on his way to Scythia, and only the Getae offered resistance. One episode from the history of the Getae is attested by several ancient writers.Strabo. Geography, 3.8.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.9.5. When Lysimachus tried to subdue the Getae he was defeated by them. The Getae king, Dromichaetes, took him prisoner but he treated him well and convinced Lysimachus there is more to gain as an ally than as an enemy of the Getae and released him. According to Diodorus, Dromichaetes entertained Lysimachus at his palace at Helis, where food was served on gold and silver plates. The discovery of the celebrated tomb at Sveshtari (1982) suggests that Helis was located perhaps in its vicinity, where remains of a large antique city are found along with dozens of other Thracian mound tombs. As stated earlier, just like the Dacians, the principal god of the Getae was Zalmoxis whom they sometimes called Gebeleizis. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia mentions a tribe called the Tyragetae,Pliny the Elder. Naturalis Historia, 4.26. \\"Leaving Taphr√¶, and going along the mainland, we find in the interior the Auchet√¶, in whose country the Hypanis has its rise, as also the Neur≈ì, in whose district the Borysthenes has its source, the Geloni, the Thyssaget√¶, the Budini, the Basilid√¶, and the Agathyrsi with their azure-coloured hair.\\" apparently a Daco-Thracian tribe who dwelt by the river Tyras (the Dniester). Their tribal name appears to be a combination of Tyras and Getae; see also the names Thyssagetae and Massagetae. The Roman poet Ovid, during his long exile in Tomis, is asserted to have written poetry (now lost) in the Getic language. In his Epistulae ex Ponto, written from the northern coast of the Black Sea, he asserts that two major, distinct languages were spoken by the sundry tribes of Scythia, which he referred to as Getic, and Sarmatian.  Physical appearance  Jerome (Letter CVII to Laeta. II) described the Getae as red and yellow-haired.The Letters of St. Jerome Fringe views on alternative origins = Suggested link Goths = The Getae are sometimes confused with the Goths in works of early medieval authors.Theodor Mommsen (2005). A History of Rome Under the Emperors. New York: Routledge. p. 281. \\"The Getae were Thracians, the Goths Germans, and apart from the coincidental similarity in their names they had nothing whatever in common.\\"David Punter (2015).

The North in the Old English Orosius: A Geographical Narrative in Context. Helsinki: Soci√©t√© N√©ophilologique. p. 110. This confusion is notably expanded on in works of Jordanes, himself of Gothic background, who transferred earlier historical narratives about the Getae to the Goths.Shami Ghosh (2015). Writing the Barbarian Past: Studies in Early Medieval Historical Narrative. Leiden: Brill Publishers. pp. 49‚Äì50. At the close of the 4th century AD, Claudian, court poet to the emperor Honorius and the patrician Stilicho, uses the ethnonym Getae to refer to the Visigoths. During 5th and 6th centuries, several historians and ethnographers (Marcellinus Comes, Orosius, John Lydus, Isidore of Seville, Procopius of Caesarea) used the same ethnonym Getae to name populations invading the Eastern Roman Empire (Goths, Gepids, Kutrigurs, Slavs). For instance, in the third book of the History of the Wars Procopius details: \\"There were many Gothic nations in earlier times, just as also at the present, but the greatest and most important of all are the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and Gepaedes. In ancient times, however, they were named Sauromatae and Melanchlaeni; and there were some too who called these nations Getic.\\"Procopius. History of the Wars, Book III (Wikisource). The Getae were considered the same people as the Goths by Jordanes in his Getica written at the middle of the 6th century. He also claims that at one point the \\"Getae\\" migrated out of Scandza, while identifying their deity Zalmoxis as a Gothic king. Jordanes assumed the earlier testimony of Orosius. The 9th-century work De Universo of Rabanus Maurus states, \\"The Massagetae are in origin from the tribe of the Scythians, and are called Massagetae, as if heavy, that is, strong Getae. = Suggested link to Jats = There have long been attempts to link the Getae and Massagetae to the Jats of South Asia. Likewise, the Dacians have been linked to the Dahae of Central Asia (and the Dahae to the Dasas of South Asia).W. W. Hunter claimed in 1886, suggested that the Jats were an Iranian people ‚Äì most likely Scythian/Saka in origin,W. W. Hunter, 2013, The Indian Empire: Its People, History and Products, Routledge, 2013, p. 251. Alexander Cunningham (1888) believed that references in classical European sourceslike Strabo, Ptolemy and Plinyto peoples such as the Zaths, may have been the Getae and/or Jats.Alexander Cunningham, 1888, cited by: Sundeep S. Jhutti, 2003, The Getes, Philadelphia, PA; Department of East Asian languages & Civilizations University of Pennsylvania, p. 13.Sundeep S. Jhutti, 2003, \\"The Getes\\", Sino- Platonic Papers, no. 127 (October), pp. 15‚Äì17. (Access: 18 March 2016). More recent authors, like Tadeusz Sulimirski, Weer Rajendra Rishi, and Chandra Chakraberty, have also linked the Getae and Jats. Less credible, however, are parallel claims by Alexander Cunningham that the Xanthii (or Zanthi) and Iatioimentioned by Strabo, Ptolemy and Plinymay have been synonymous with the Getae and/or Jats. The Xanthii were later established to be a subgroup (tribe or clan) of the Dahae. Subsequent scholars, such as Edwin Pulleyblank, Josef Markwart (also known as Joseph Marquart) and L√°szl√≥ Torday, suggest that Iatioi may be another name for a people known in classical Chinese sources as the Yuezhi and in South Asian contexts as the Ku·π£ƒÅnas (or Kushans).

Bernhard Riemann proved that a conditionally convergent series may be rearranged to converge to any value at all, including ‚àû or ‚àí‚àû; see Riemann series theorem. The L√©vy‚ÄìSteinitz theorem identifies the set of values to which a series of terms in Rn can converge. A typical conditionally convergent integral is that on the non-negative real axis of sin (x^2) (see Fresnel integral).

The station is owned by the Beasley Broadcast Group, through licensee Beasley Media Group, LLC, and broadcasts an active rock radio format. Studios and offices are located in Bala Cynwyd and the tower used by the station is atop One Liberty Place at (). WMMR broadcasts using HD Radio. Its HD2 subchannel plays live rock performances and sessions in WMMR's studios. WMMR carries Philadelphia Flyers hockey games when its all- sports sister station 97.5 WPEN is airing another sporting event and cannot broadcast the Flyers game. WMMR is the home of Preston and Steve, heard weekday mornings, and midday personality Pierre Robert, heard on WMMR since 1981. History On February 11, 1941, the Federal Communications Commission granted Pennsylvania Broadcasting Company a construction permit for a new FM station on 44.7 MHz on the original 42-50 MHz FM broadcast band with the W47PH call sign. The construction permit was modified on November 4, 1941 when the FCC reallocated the station to 44.9 MHz with a corresponding call sign change to W49PH. The FCC also on this date granted the station authority for the first time to begin broadcasting. The station signed on for the first time on April 20, 1942, and was granted its first license on March 2, 1943. Programming was initially a simulcast of sister station AM 610 WIP. On November 1, 1943, the station was assigned the WIP-FM call sign. After the FCC created the current FM broadcast band on June 27, 1945, Pennsylvania Broadacasting applied to the FCC for a construction permit on October 24, 1946 to install a new transmitter and antenna for operation on 97.5 MHz. On July 10, 1947, the FCC reallocated the station to 93.3 MHz, modifying the construction permit. The commission granted Pennsylvania Broadcasting a new license for the station for operation on 93.3 MHz on December 22, 1948. In the 1950s and 1960s, WIP-FM carried a full service format of middle of the road (MOR) music, news, sports and talk. The station's license was voluntarily reassigned by the FCC to WIP Broadcasting, Inc. on September 17, 1958, followed by another voluntary reassignment to Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation on December 29, 1959. The FCC granted a licensee name change from Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation to Metromedia, Inc. on May 11, 1961. On August 6, 1962, Metromedia applied for a construction permit to relocate the station's transmitter and antenna from 35 South 9th Street, Philadelphia to 12 South 12th Street, Philadelphia (the address of the PSFS Building). This resulted in raising the station's height above average terrain (HAAT) from 430 feet to 668 feet, while decreasing the station's effective radiated power (ERP) from 20,000 watts to 7,500 watts. The FCC granted Metromedia a new license for the station with the new facilities on September 30, 1963. On July 1, 1966, the station's call sign was changed to WMMR. The call sign reflected the name of the station's owner, \\"Metromedia\\" (and \\"Radio\\"). (From 1948 to 1993 WMMR was used, unofficially, as a slogan by a local student-run carrier current radio station at the University of Minnesota.) The MOR format was still being used, but with different programming from the AM side, although the AM disc jockeys' announcements were used for both stations. Studios of WIP-610am and WMMR 93.3fm were on 19th Street near Rittenhouse Square. Beginning in 1968, WMMR began adopting a progressive rock format, similar to that of several Metromedia-owned stations including WNEW-FM in New York City. WNEW-FM and WMMR had a close relationship, ran similar promotions, and sometimes featured each other's disc jockeys on the air. WMMS in Cleveland, KMET in Los Angeles and KSAN in San Francisco were also part of the Metromedia chain and also helped pioneer the progressive rock format in the 1960s. Dave Herman was WMMR's first rock DJ. His show, dubbed The Marconi Experiment, debuted on April 29, 1968. Before Herman's arrival, WMMR ran an \\"MOR\\" format featuring programs such as \\"Sinatra and Company.\\" The Marconi Experiment was very much an experiment for the station, with progressive rock still new to the FM band. The first song played on the show was \\"Flying\\" by The Beatles. Over the instrumental song, Herman recited these words: \\"Arise my heart, and fill your voice with music. For he who shares not dawn with his song, is one of the sons of ever darkness.\\" This was known as \\"The Incantation\\" and continued as the regular show opening. Michael Cuscuna, from the University of Pennsylvania's 88.5 WXPN, replaced Herman in 1970, but was quickly hired away by WABC-FM (now WPLJ) in New York. Michael Tearson, also from WXPN, replaced Cuscuna and remained a mainstay at WMMR for over 20 years. Herman went to 95.5 WABC-FM and then for a couple of decades on 102.7 WNEW-FM, and later on 92.3 WXRK. Tearson later worked at 102.9 WMGK in Philadelphia, from April 2002 until January 2013. He was also heard on Sirius XM's Deep Tracks channel. Several Philadelphia FM stations tried to compete with WMMR in the late 1960s, including 92.5 WIFI and 105.3 WDAS-FM. Neither station stayed with the rock format for long. In 1970, WIFI switched to a Top 40 format. WDAS-FM changed format around 1971 to reflect its AM counterpart as an urban contemporary station. Later in the 1970s, two other Philadelphia radio stations became competitors: WYSP (formerly WIBG-FM) and WIOQ. WYSP later became a classic rock outlet while WIOQ became a Top 40 radio station. One of WMMR's most influential disc jockeys during the 1970s was Ed Sciaky, who was known for playing and boosting the careers of new artists such as Billy Joel and Yes. Sciaky is credited with introducing Bruce Springsteen to Philadelphia, and decades later, the city remains one of Springsteen's strongest fan bases and the scenes of many of his best-received concerts. WMMR alumni include David Dye, host of the World Cafe on 88.5 WXPN and syndicated on many NPR stations. Another formar WMMR DJ is Nick Spitzer, now a New Orleans resident and host of \\"American Routes\\" on NPR. One-time WMMR midday DJ Dick Hungate later switched to 94.1 WYSP, pioneering the classic rock format in Philadelphia. John DeBella, now hosting mornings on co-owned 102.9 WMGK, was the morning drive time DJ for many years, alongside newscaster and sidekick Mark \\"The Shark\\" Drucker, who later was a reporter on all-news 1060 KYW. Some WMMR DJs such as Dave Herman and Carol Miller would later go onto longtime careers on New York stations. On July 17, 1980, Metromedia applied for a construction permit to increase the station's ERP to 29,000 watts. The FCC granted the permit on July 17, 1981, followed by a new license with the upgraded facilities on August 1, 1981. WMMR's license was transferred to Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation on October 22, 1986. On October 26, 1987, Metropolitan Broadcasting applied for a construction permit to change the transmitter location to \\"Building Rooftop 1650 Market St., Philadelphia, PA\\" (the address of One Liberty Place) and increase the station's HAAT to . The FCC granted the permit on May 1, 1989. On October 26, 1989, WMMR was purchased by Group W. Radio Acquisition Company, with the sale consummating on December 7, 1989. Group W. Radio modified the construction permit on February 12, 1992, by decreasing the HAAT to and changing the ERP to 18,000 watts. The FCC granted the change on March 9, 1992. The FCC granted a new license with the new facilities on January 6, 1997. Greater Los Angeles Radio, Inc. (a division of Greater Media) purchased WMMR, with the sale consummating on August 22, 1997. In early 2006, WMMR launched its digital HD2 subchannel with the \\"WMMaRchives\\" format, airing the station's archive of live and studio performances. On July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WMMR) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1. Awards In 2007, WMMR was nominated for the Radio & Records Magazine Award for \\"Active Rock Station of the Year\\" in a top 25 market. Other nominees included WIYY in Baltimore, WAAF in Boston, KBPI in Denver, WRIF in Detroit, and KISW in Seattle. In 2010, the station was honored by the National Association of Broadcasters with the Marconi Award for \\"Rock Station of the Year.\\" WMMR has also been honored as the Major Market Radio Station of the Year by the rock community \\"RadioContraband\\" in both 2011 and 2012.Radio Contraband.com In the late 1980s, WMMR was recognized as one of the best rock stations in America by Rolling Stone Magazine.

He succeeded the assassinated Albert Avogadro. Raoul de M√©rencourt was a native of Champagne. He seems to have come to the Holy Land as part of the entourage following Henry II, count of Champagne and future husband of Isabella I, queen of Jerusalem. Raoul worked as a notary in the Haute Cour in Acre. In 1206 Albert, formerly bishop of Vercelli, arrived as the new patriarch, following upon Soffredo Gaetani, who resigned the office after only one year, and went off to join the Fourth Crusade in Constantinople. In 1208 Albert the patriarch sent him as part of an official delegation to Philip Augustus, king of France, to seek a husband and king- consort for the young heiress to the throne, Maria of Montferrat. The king, with the encouragement of Blanche of Navarre, countess-regent of Champagne, selected one of her feudal vassals, John of Brienne. John held the title of count of Brienne on behalf of his brother Walter (Gautier) of Brienne, whose cause had briefly attracted the young Giovanni Bernadone (later Francis of Assisi) to his cause. At Walter's death in 1205, John held the county as guardian for Walter's son, later to become count of Jaffa. John of Brienne arrived in Acre on 13 September 1210 and married Maria the following day, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the major feast of the kingdom of Jerusalem. The two were then crowned king and queen on 3 October in the cathedral of Tyre. The patriarch recommended Raoul to become the chancellor and guide for the newly arrived monarch. Queen Maria died shortly after giving birth to their daughter Yolanda, officially known as Isabella II. The barons of the kingdom were uncertain of John of Brienne's ability to lead. In 1211 Albert sent Raoul to seek the counsel of Pope Innocent III. He returned with clear instructions to support John as regent-king for his daughter. At Albert's assassination on 14 September 1214, while in procession to the cathedral of the Holy Cross in Acre, the post of patriarch became open. The canons of the Holy Sepulchre, following their own custom in imitation of the Acts of the Apostles, selected two candidates to succeed Albert. One candidate was Lotario Rosario de Cremona, who had originally succeeded Albert as bishop of Vercelli, but who later became archbishop of Pisa. He occupied a position in the Roman hierarchy that was very similar to the esteem enjoined by Albert. The second candidate was the king's own chancellor, Raoul de M√©rencourt, who also held the episcopal see of Sidon. He was one of only three bishops installed by Albert during his years as patriarch. The king came down on the side of his chancellor and fellow countryman. Pope Innocent III ratified that choice, and Raoul was installed as patriarch during the Fourth Lateran Council, which took place in November 1215. Along with Pope Innocent III, he gave a sermon on the first day of the proceedings (11 November) calling for a new crusade to recover the Holy Land. Further preparations for the crusade (the Fifth) were made on the last day of the council, 30 November. However, for various reasons the crusade was postponed until 1217, after the death of Innocent. Raoul was appointed as one of Honorius III's papal legates, and was escorted back to his see in Acre by John of Brienne, nominal King of Jerusalem. He personally participated in the crusade against Egypt. The assembled crusader armies left Acre for Damietta in Egypt during the last days of May 1218. On the 29 August 1219 an attack on Damietta failed, as St. Francis of Assisi had predicted. The successful taking of Damietta occurred over 4‚Äì5 November 1219. It is recounted that at one point the patriarch carried a relic of the True Cross, and prostrated himself with his head buried under the sand in order to ensure the success of the siege at Damietta. The whole crusade came to a disastrous end on 29 August 1221, when the crusading armies were trapped by the flooding waters of the Nile and the combined armies of the sultan, al-Kamil, and his two brothers, al-Mu'azzam and al-Ashraf. The sultan, after allowing the hostages to be ransomed, agreed to an eight-year truce. In 1222 the pope summoned the king, Pelagius Galvani, the papal legate, patriarch Raoul and other leaders to attend a meeting with him the emperor Frederick II to be held in Verona on 11 November. The pope's illness forced the meeting to be postponed until 25 March 1223 at the imperial villa in Ferentino. There they struck an agreement to have the king's young daughter marry the newly-widowed emperor, Frederick II. He agreed to then lead the next crusade and to have his fleet depart from Europe by 24 June 1225. On 1 March 1224 Honorius III wrote to the patriarch of Jerusalem of the imminent departure of the imperial fleet, and to prepare for the marriage of Yolanda of Brienne (aka Isabelle II) to the emperor. Any and all impediments were to be cleared away. Patriarch Raoul, John of Brienne and Herman von Salzal met with the pope in the summer of 1224 to deal with the emperor's announcement that conditions in Sicily had so deteriorated that he could not possibly depart for the Holy Land at this time. A new date for departure was arrived at. As a new patriarch was nominated and in place by May 1225, it would seem that Raoul de M√©rencourt died in late 1224. His replacement, G√©rold of Lausanne, bishop of Valence and former abbot of Cluny, was elected on 10 May 1225.

The picture features Daniel Hendler, Adriana Aizemberg, Jorge D'El√≠a, among others. The drama was Argentina's official choice for the 2004 Oscar Awards, Foreign Language film category.American Cinematheque . Argentina: New Cinema III, November 19, 2004. The comedy-drama tells of Ariel Makaroff, the grandson of Holocaust-era Polish refugees, who is currently on a complex search for his personal and cultural identity. Plot The episodes in the life of a Jewish family in the Once neighborhood of Buenos Aires and the other shopkeepers in a low-rent commercial gallery are depicted in the story. The narrator, Ariel Makaroff (Daniel Hendler), is the son of Sonia Makaroff (Adriana Aizemberg) who was deserted by her husband (Jorge D'El√≠a) when he went to Israel in 1973 to fight in the Yom Kippur War. Yet, the father is in touch with Sonia via telephone weekly and supports Ariel and his brother Joseph (Sergio Boris). Sonia runs a lingerie shop in the gallery. Ariel is a young man in a hurry without much of a sense of direction. He's having an affair with Rita (Silvina Bosco), an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend Estella (Melina Petriella), and fantasizes of emigrating to Poland, where his family came from during World War II. He carps at his grandmother (Rosita Londner) for immigration documents that will support his claim to Polish citizenship as he wants to become \\"European.\\" This forces his grandmother to remember her memories of Holocaust Poland. Ariel also visits the rabbi in order to get documents. One of them has been cut in a corner and the rabbi explains: \\"So, no one can use it again.\\" - \\"Oh! Like circumcision!\\", Ariel retorts. Like Woody Allen in \\"Deconstructed Harry\\", Burman takes an ironic stand against circumcision. At one point, the shop owners organize a race against another group of merchants. They hope to earn a cash purse and fix up the exterior of their gallery and install air conditioning. Other characters include: a large Italian family whose noisy arguments drown out the radios in their radio repair shop; a quiet Korean couple who run a feng shui boutique; Mitelman (Diego Korol) who runs a travel agency, but which is really a front for currency smuggling; and a solitary stationer named Osvaldo (Isaac Fajm). Right before the big race his father suddenly shows up in Buenos Aires. His mother confesses to Ariel that his father left Argentina and the family because she had a brief affair with Osvaldo, the retailer next door. It was a one time thing and did not mean anything but it ruined the marriage. Ariel finally gets to hear his father's side of the story: he could not get over the fact that his mother had betrayed him with Osvaldo. El√≠as can finally enfold his son in a long-overdue embrace, and Ariel embraces his father as well in the closing moments of the film. The grandmother sings a klezmer song over the closing credits.

Film critic A.O. Scott, film critic for The New York Times, liked the direction of the film, writing, \\"Lost Embrace never feels strenuous or overdone. The tenderness of the family drama at its center, and the deep, hard-to-articulate feelings of a son for his enigmatic father and his heroically patient mother, emerge with a charming haphazardness. The sly artfulness is apparent only in retrospect. This is a small movie about a small world, but its modesty is part of what makes it durable and satisfying.\\"Scott A.O. The New York Times, film review, \\"Resenting an Absent Father, Very Present in the Mind,\\" January 28, 2005. Kenneth Turan, film critic for the Los Angeles Times, liked the films direction and wrote, \\"Director (and co-writer) Burman displays an assured but intimate filmmaking style, at once casual, playful and idiosyncratic. With key sections of the film related by Ariel in voice-over, it's also a style that fosters complicity and connection with a central character who otherwise might not be a personal favorite.\\"Turan, Kenneth. Los Angeles Times, film review, \\"Lost Embrace: This poignant film resonates with unexpected charm,\\" February 4, 2005. Last accessed: January 13, 2008. Peter Keough, critic for the Boston Phoenix, also liked Burman's direction, though at times he said the film felt a bit derivative, and wrote, \\"Burman captures with an affection and an irony that match Fran√ßois Truffaut's, though his stylistic mannerisms can seem a little imitative.\\"Keough, Peter. The Boston Phoenix, film review, April 1--7, 2005. The Boston Globe film critic, Wesley Morris, was impressed by the comedy, and wrote, \\"Lost Embrace has a novelist's human touch. Were it a book, it would go somewhere on the shelf with Jonathan Safran Foer and early Philip Roth. It also possesses traces of early Jean-Luc Godard and his wit with characters, as well as some of Wes Anderson's random silliness. But unlike in Godard and Anderson, an emotional undercurrent runs beneath this movie, and Burman makes that feel good without feeling strained.\\"Morris, Wesley.

Over a nineteen-year professional career (1978‚Äì1997), he played for Bradford Northern, Wigan, Balmain, Western Suburbs and Leeds. He won 36 caps for Great Britain, captaining the team from 1988 to 1992, and 2 for England. Nicknamed 'Mr Magic' and 'The Black Pearl', he played most often as a or after starting out as a or . Hanley won the Man of Steel Award a record three times, the Lance Todd Trophy once, and the Golden Boot in 1988. He was awarded the MBE in January 1990 for services to the game. In 2005 he was inducted into the Rugby Football League Hall of Fame. After his playing career, he had spells as head coach of Great Britain, St Helens and Doncaster. Biography Hanley was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, of Jamaican descent.http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/jamaica-s-brave-new- world-1-2556629 He is the father of Umyla Hanley, who currently plays in Super League for the Wigan Warriors. =Bradford Northern= In 1978, Hanley signed for Bradford Northern from the junior club Corpus Christi.Wigan Warriors Official Website Ellery Hanley MBE article. URL retrieved 5 August 2006. On 26 November 1978, he made his professional d√©but for Northern against Rochdale Hornets in a League Division One match. He helped his club to a 30‚Äì18 victory, by scoring a try on his d√©but.Bradford Bulls Official Website Bull Masters ‚Äì Ellery Hanley article. URL retrieved 5 August 2006. He had to wait his time before gaining a regular first team place but in the early 1980s he emerged as one of the top players in the game. In 1984‚Äì85, his last season with the club, Hanley became the first man to score more than 50 tries in a season since Alf Ellaby, and the first non-winger to reach this figure for 70 years. He scored a remarkable 55 tries in only 37 appearances, an achievement made even more remarkable as he switched between the positions of wing, centre and stand-off. For his achievements in the 1984‚Äì85 season, he was awarded the Man of Steel award, which is awarded to the player judged to have made the biggest impact in the season, as well as the First Division Player of the Year. In total, Hanley made 126 appearances for the club, scoring 89 tries. =Wigan= In 1985 he signed for Wigan for a fee of ¬£150,000, with Steve Donlan and Phil Ford moving to Bradford Northern in exchange for Hanley as part of the deal. Hanley finished his first season for the club with 35 tries. During his second season at Wigan he scored 63 tries playing at centre, stand-off and loose forward, an all-time record for a non-winger. In the 1987 season, Hanley was awarded the Man of Steel award, being voted the player who made the biggest impact during the season. His play that year helped Wigan to their first league title in 27 years. He played in Wigan's 1987 World Club Challenge victory against the visiting Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Hanley holds the record for the most tries in a Regal Trophy (or precursors) Final with 3 tries. In 1988, Hanley was in dispute with Wigan and was stripped of the captaincy. He was transfer listed at a then record ¬£350,000. But when Wigan reached the semi-final of the 1988 Rugby League Challenge Cup against Salford, coach Graham Lowe recalled Hanley to the team. Upon his return Hanley scored a try in the final. Hanley scored a try at Wembley Stadium. Ironically it was set up by Joe Lydon ‚Äì reminiscent of the two tries he scored against Wigan four years earlier. Ray French stated it was the second greatest ever seen in a final. Hanley was then selected as captain for the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour. The Lions defeated Papua New Guinea but lost The Ashes to Australia, losing the first two tests in Sydney and Brisbane. The third test was a triumph for Hanley and his Lions though as they defeated Australia for the first time in a test match since 5 November 1978, ending Australia's streak of 15 straight wins over Great Britain. The Lions then defeated New Zealand 12‚Äì10 in Christchurch for their only test in NZ to finish the tour on a high note. In 1989, Hanley helped the club reach the Challenge Cup Final, where they won a 27‚Äì0 victory over St Helens in front of a crowd of approximately 78,000 people at Wembley, the first time in Cup Final history at Wembley that a side had been held scoreless. He was awarded the Lance Todd Trophy for the man of the match. For his performances throughout the season he was also awarded the Man of Steel award for the second time as a Wigan player, and the third time in his overall career. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas Golden Boot, which was awarded to the world's most outstanding player. Hanley remembers that \\"It was something I always strove for. I wanted to be the best player in the world‚Ä¶ Looking back, to be the world's best player at that time was the biggest honour of my career.\\"\\"A few drinks with Ellery Hanley\\" article. URL retrieved 5 August 2006. Internationally, 1990 was a disappointment. Hanley captained Great Britain against the 1990 Kangaroos, and although they pulled off a shock 19‚Äì12 win over Australia in the first test at Wembley with Hanley playing a prominent role, the Kangaroos would come back to win the second and third tests to extend their Ashes series streak over the Lions which dated back to 1973. Prior to the arrival of the Kangaroos in England, Hanley's influence in the British game was shown. During one early season Wigan game leading English referee Robin Whitfield sent Hanley off for back-chat and as he departed the field Hanley allegedly told Whitfield that he would end up in the second division. Hanley was originally handed a 2 match suspension for his actions. However, upon appeal this was reduced to just one week, and Whitfield, despite his standing as one of the game's top officials, refereed the second division for the next 6 weeks. He led Wigan to another two League and Cup doubles. By 1991 though his relationship with the media reached an all-time low. Although both Wigan and Great Britain captain, he was not expected to carry out any media role. In total he spent around five years with the club, making 202 appearances and scoring 189 tries. In his Wigan career, he won a World Club Championship, 4 Challenge Cup winners medals, 3 Championships, 1 Premiership, 4 John Player Trophy Winners medals and 4 Lancashire Cup winners medals. He was also voted Man of Steel twice as a Wigan player. Hanley was inducted into the Wigan Hall of Fame in 2007. =Balmain (1988)= Hanley, the Great Britain captain, was signed by Sydney club Balmain Tigers to play the remaining rounds of the 1988 NSWRFL season for them once his representative commitments were fulfilled. In his first season with the club he helped them to the Grand Final in 1988 against Canterbury by defeating Penrith, Manly, Canberra as well as Cronulla in the preliminary finals. The preliminary final against Cronulla was a closely fought battle, until Hanley went to set up the try that would seal the victory for Balmain as they edged out their opponents 9‚Äì2, the win sending the club to their first Grand Final since 1969. The first half of the Grand Final was a tight contest as Balmain led 6‚Äì4 scoring due to a mistake from Canterbury Jason Alchin. In the 26th minute, Hanley was wrapped up low by Andrew Farrar, and as he want to offload the ball, Terry Lamb hit Hanley with a high tackle that went unnoticed by the referee. He hit the ground in an awkward position and was concussed. He played no further part in the match, and his side went on to lose the game 24‚Äì12. Lamb said he was only looking to wrap the ball up and there was no intention. Lamb commented in his 1992 book that Balmain had key players such as Wayne Pearce, Ben Elias, Paul Sironen and Garry Jack that there was no chance to target one individual. Speaking to Inside Sport Magazine in August 2005, Hanley was asked: > What do you remember about that infamous tackle by Terry Lamb? \\"I don't know > if it was caused by Terry Lamb, or if it was just my head hitting the > ground. I couldn't tell you because I have never looked at it since. Some > people have said Terry got a good shot on me. I suspect, however, it was > more a case of my head hitting the ground. I like to think it was > accidental. Afterwards, I was concussed and didn't know where I was. I > didn't regain all my faculties immediately so, from a safety point of view, > I had to come off the football field. It was a shame, but it is a physical > game and sometimes things like that happen.\\" > Have you spoken to Lamb since then? \\"No, I never have. I have never bumped > into him. I have to say I respect him as a footballer. I don't know him as a > person, but by all accounts he is a good guy. Let me be clear that I have no > malice towards him, none at all, regardless of the incident being deliberate > or accidental.\\" The New South Wales Rugby League, despite the media pressure, backed up Lamb's version of events and deemed he had no case to answer. =Western Suburbs= In 1989, Hanley moved from Balmain to Western Suburbs. He played a total of thirteen games, scoring four tries for a total of sixteen points in his one and only season for the club. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas Rugby League World Golden Boot Award, which was awarded to the world's most outstanding player. =Leeds= In September 1991 at the age of 30, he joined Leeds as a player and coach for ¬£250,000, and on his arrival at the club, was immediately appointed captain. He was selected to go on the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, but his appearances were restricted by injury. Also in 1992 he played from the bench in Great Britain's defeat by Australia in the World Cup Final at Wembley. The 1993‚Äì94 season saw Hanley play in the Challenge Cup Final for the first time with Leeds. In the previous game, the Challenge Cup semi-final, Leeds faced St Helens at Central Park. Hanley scored two tries to put the club back on the big stage for the first time in sixteen years. In the Final, the club's opponents were Hanley's former club Wigan. In front of an official attendance at Wembley of 78,348, Leeds were defeated 16‚Äì26 by Wigan. In the 1994‚Äì95 season, Hanley set a new world record for a forward, scoring 41 tries in a season. During that season, Hanley helped the club reach the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley for the second consecutive year. Ironically it was the same opponent that they faced a year earlier in the same competition final. In front of an attendance of 78,550 they were defeated, just as they had been a year earlier by their opponents, this time going down 30‚Äì10. Whilst playing for Leeds, the World League of American football was formed in 1991. It was reported that Hanley would play for the London Monarchs but this never materialised. =Balmain (1996‚Äì97)= In 1996 and well past his prime, Hanley returned to the Australian club Balmain for his second spell with the club. Hanley stated that \\"I wanted to be respected by the Australians as well, because their game is so superior to ours.\\" Representative career Hanley won caps for England while at Bradford Northern in 1984 against Wales, while at Leeds in 1992 against Wales, and won caps for Great Britain while at Bradford Northern in 1984 against France (sub), France, Australia (3 matches), New Zealand (3 matches), and Papua New Guinea, in 1985 against France (2 matches), while at Wigan in 1985 against New Zealand (3 matches), in 1986 against France, and Australia, in 1987 against France (2 matches), and Papua New Guinea, in 1988 against France (2 matches), Papua New Guinea, Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand, in 1989 against France (2 matches), in 1990 against France, and Australia (3 matches), in 1991 against France (2 matches), while at Leeds in 1992 against Australia, in 1993 against France. =Great Britain= He made his Great Britain d√©but as a substitute, whilst still a Bradford Northern player, in January 1984 against France in Avignon. He was selected in the Great Britain squad in 1984 to tour to Australia and was one of the stars of the 1984 Ashes series, scoring a remarkable twelve tries playing mostly on the wing. In 1988, he became a regular member of the Great Britain team and was appointed captain. In the 1988 Ashes series, he led his side to victory over Australia for the first time in 10 seasons. Along the way he also scored eight tries. Hanley also toured Australia in 1992 for the Ashes series, but despite being captain of the squad, on the field he made only one appearance and played less than fifteen minutes in a minor tour match against Newcastle. In total he was capped 34 times by Great Britain. Coaching career In 1994 following Mal Reilly's decision to step down as both Great Britain and Halifax coach to become coach of Australian club the Newcastle Knights, Hanley was appointed coach of the Great Britain Lions during the Ashes series against Australia during the 1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. His appointment meant he had become the first black person to coach or manage a major national team in Great Britain. After a 12-man Lions team pulled off a gutsy 8‚Äì4 win in the first test at Wembley (following the first half send-off of captain Shaun Edwards for a high tackle), they lost the series when Australia won the second test 34‚Äì8 at Old Trafford, and 23‚Äì4 at Elland Road in Leeds. The 1994 Ashes series would prove to be Hanley's only time as Great Britain coach. For the 1995 Rugby League World Cup held in England and Wales, Great Britain was not playing, with England and Wales competing instead. Also, Hanley had signed with the Australian Rugby League during the Super League war which began in 1995 while the RFL were aligned with the Super League. In 1999, he was appointed as the coach of St. Helens as the successor to Shaun McRae. In his first season as coach, he led St. Helens to the 1999 Super League Grand Final. His side defeated the Bradford Bulls, the club he began his professional playing career at, by 8‚Äì6 in October of that year. Whilst he harboured a strong desire to win, he could appear aloof and had several acrimonious disagreements with the St. Helens board of directors, which led to his suspension and eventual sacking as the manager of St Helens in 2000. Ian Millward was appointed as his successor. He switched to rugby union coaching and took up posts with Bristol Rugby, and in the England national set-up. He also got involved in the sport of squash before returning to rugby league as a coaching consultant with Castleford Tigers in 2004. He worked with Cas for just two months before leaving. On 14 December 2007 Hanley was unveiled as the coach of National League Two Club Doncaster. He resigned from that r√¥le on 28 September 2008, following Doncaster's successful promotion play-off campaign. Recognition In January 1990 he was honoured with an MBE by the Queen for his services to rugby league. In October 2005, he was inducted into the Rugby Football League Hall of Fame. Outside rugby league In 2009 Hanley was one of thirteen celebrities taking part in Dancing on Ice, partnered with Frankie Poultney. He was the sixth person to be eliminated from the show.

Constructed in Scotland during the mid-1920s, the ship was commissioned in 1928, and spent the first part of her career primarily operating in Australian waters, with some deployments to the China Station. At the start of World War II, Canberra was initially used for patrols and convoy escort around Australia. In July 1940, she was reassigned as a convoy escort between Western Australia, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. During this deployment, which ended in mid-1941, Canberra was involved in the hunt for several German auxiliary cruisers. The cruiser resumed operations in Australian waters, but when Japan entered the war, she was quickly reassigned to convoy duties around New Guinea, interspersed with operations in Malaysian and Javanese waters. Canberra later joined Task Force 44, and was involved in the Guadalcanal Campaign and the Tulagi landings. On 9 August 1942, Canberra was struck by the opening Japanese shots of the Battle of Savo Island, and was quickly damaged. Unable to propel herself, the cruiser was evacuated and sunk in Ironbottom Sound by two American destroyers. The United States Navy cruiser was named in honour of the Australian ship. Design Canberra was one of seven Kent-class cruisers‚Äîa subclass of the ‚Äîdesigned by Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 102 The ship was long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of , and a maximum draught of .Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 39 She displaced 9,850 tons at light load, and 10,000 tons at standard load. The Kent class were built to meet the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty; with a reduction in armament and protection. Canberra was powered by eight Yarrow boilers which fed steam to four Brown-Curtis geared turbines; these in turn provided to the ship's four propeller shafts. The cruiser could reach speeds of , which could be maintained for , although could be travelled at the more economical standard cruising speed. Before World War II, the ship's company was normally 690 (49 officers, 641 sailors); this increased to 710 when acting as a flagship. During wartime service, the normal company expanded to 751 (61 officers, 690 sailors), and at the time of her loss, 819 people were aboard. Canberras forward 8-inch gun turrets (designated \\"A\\" and \\"B\\") Canberras main armament consisted of eight 8-inch Mark VIII guns in four twin turrets. Secondary armament consisted of four 4-inch quick-firing high-angle guns and four 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" guns.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 101 A mixture of .303-inch machine guns were carried for close defence work: initially this consisted of four Vickers machine guns and twelve Lewis machine guns, although four Lewis guns were later removed. During a refit in 1942, two multiple pom-poms and five 20 mm Oerlikons were added to enhance the anti- aircraft armament. Four 3-pounder quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were used as saluting guns. Two sets of quadruple 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted. Depth charges were carried: these were deployed by rails. The cruiser was designed to carry a single amphibious aircraft: initially a Supermarine Seagull III aircraft, but this was replaced in 1936 by the Supermarine Walrus. However, the aircraft catapult was not installed until April 1936, during a refit in Sydney. Before this, the Seagull amphibian was lowered into the water by the ship's recovery crane, and took off from there. Armour aboard Canberra was limited to an armour deck over the machinery spaces and magazines, ranging from in thickness. Armour plate was also fitted to the turrets (up to thick) and the conning tower ( thick). Anti-torpedo bulges were also fitted. In 1924, the Australian government ordered two Kent-class cruisers to replace the ageing light cruisers and .Clark, The Fighting Canberras, p. 9 These ships were to be named and Canberra, with both to be built by John Brown & Company, at their shipyard at Clydebank, Scotland: the only two County-class ships built in Scotland. Canberra was laid down on 9 September 1925, and given the yard number 513.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 40 Canberra was launched on 31 May 1927 by Princess Mary; the first ship of the RAN launched by a member of the Royal Family.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, pp. 367-8 Work on the ship was completed on 10 July 1928, the day after the cruiser was commissioned into the RAN. Most of the initial ship's company came from Sydney.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 105 Canberra cost approximately A¬£2 million to construct. Operational history =Pre-World War II= Canberra left Portsmouth on 4 December 1928, after several months of workup trials, and arrived at Sydney on 16 February 1929. The cruiser operated primarily in Australian waters during the next ten years, spending periods of time as the RAN flagship. On 20 September 1929, during a round-Australia cruise, the ship grounded on a sand shoal outside Roebuck Bay, Western Australia.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, pp. 105‚Äì6 The damage did not prevent the ship from operating, and it was not until early 1930 that the affected hull plates were replaced.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 106 In September 1931, Canberra visited New Caledonia and Fiji. The cruiser operated on the Royal Navy's China Station in 1932 and 1937. In 1934 the ship was assigned to escort , which was transporting the Duke of Gloucester during a visit to Australia. In August 1936 she brought Admiral Sir Murray Anderson to Sydney, Australia to be invested as Governor of New South Wales. Canberra entering Sydney Harbour on 6 August 1936. The cruiser is carrying Admiral Sir Murray Anderson, who was to be invested as Governor of New South Wales. =World War II= For the first nine months of World War II, Canberra was assigned to patrol and escort duties around Australia. In January 1940, the cruiser escorted the first convoy carrying Australian and New Zealand soldiers, Anzac Convoy US 1, to the Middle East. During May, Canberra joined sister ship Australia to escort Anzac Convoy US 3 across the Indian Ocean; the convoy was diverted via the Cape of Good Hope following fears that Italy was about to join the war. On 26 June, Canberra left Australia with the troopship Strathmore for Cape Town, where the cruiser was assigned to the Indian Ocean as a convoy escort between Fremantle, Colombo, and Cape Town.Clark, The Fighting Canberras, p. 10Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 107 During November, Canberra attempted to locate the German merchant raider Atlantis. She returned unsuccessful to Fremantle on 20 November, but sailed that night with a skeleton crew after the merchant ship SS Maimoa signalled that she was under attack by a German merchant raider (the auxiliary cruiser Pinguin). Although unable to find Maimoa or her attacker, Canberra encountered three lifeboats on 22 November, which carried 27 sailors who had escaped from SS Port Brisbane, another victim of Pinguin. The cruiser returned to Fremantle on 27 November without encountering the German raider. Shortly after, Canberra headed for the East Indies Station. In February 1941, Canberra was involved in efforts to locate the German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 41 In early March, Canberra encountered two merchant ships; a tanker supplying a possible merchant raider, which split up and fled when ordered to stop.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 113‚Äì4 Canberra pursued the suspected raider, and fired on her from maximum range to avoid a retaliatory attack, while her Walrus amphibian attempted to stop the tanker by dropping several bombs.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 114 Both ships (the raider supply ship Coburg and the captured Norwegian tanker Ketty Br√∏vig) had commenced scuttling after the first attack from their pursuit, but the Australians continued attacking: the Walrus used all her bombs, while Canberra fired 215 shells, many of them misses. A post-action analysis found that if Canberra had closed before firing, the same quantity of damage could have been achieved for less ammunition, and one or both ships might have been captured.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 456‚Äì7Frame, HMAS Sydney, pgs. 114, 133 Canberra was assigned back to Australia in July; operating around the western and southern coasts. The cruiser was in Sydney in December 1941, when Japan entered the war: Canberra was quickly reassigned to convoy duties around New Guinea, interspersed by operations in Malaysian and Javanese waters. On 12 December 1941, the cruiser was ordered from Sydney to meet the Pensacola Convoy, hoisting the flag of Rear-Admiral John G. Crace as she stopped in Brisbane on 15 December. In company with HMAS Perth she sailed for the vicinity of New Caledonia to meet the light cruiser and the convoy. In January 1942, Canberra and escorted the troopship Aquitania, leaving Sydney 10 January, carrying reinforcements to Singapore as far as Ratai Bay, Sunda Strait where the reinforcements were transshipped into seven smaller vessels for the final run to Singapore. She was then part of the escort for that convoy, \\"MS.2A\\" of six Dutch KPM vessels and one British vessel, to Singapore arriving 24 January. During her return voyage via the Dutch East Indies, the cruiser was assigned to the ANZAC Squadron. A refit occurred in Sydney from February to May 1942, during which Canberra became the first Australian warship to be fitted with radar (a Type 241 surface search set, and an A290 air-warning set). The cruiser was present in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack on 31 May-1 June. Although not damaged, at 04:40, Canberra recorded that the Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her.Grose, A Very Rude Awakening, pp. 160‚Äì2 This may have been one of many false alarms throughout the night; however, one of the midget submarines had attempted to fire its torpedoes at a target, but these did not release because of damage sustained during the infiltration. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes. Canberra under way off Tulagi during the landings on 7‚Äì8 August 1942. Three transports are among the ships visible in the distance, with Tulagi and the Nggela Islands beyond. The cruiser headed north the day after the submarine attack to join the ANZAC Squadron, which had been redesignated Task Force 44. On 17 June, Canberra took part in offensive patrols through the Coral Sea, and from July, she was assigned to Operation Watchtower; the opening stages of the Guadalcanal Campaign. The cruiser escorted the force to be landed at Tulagi from 5 August, and screened the force during the landings on 7 and 8 August; the cruiser encountered no initial resistance.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 41‚Äì2 Loss During the afternoon of 8 August, a Japanese task force commanded by Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and consisting of five cruisers and a destroyer began to approach the south of Savo Island, with the intention to attack the naval force supporting the landing at Guadalcanal, then those at Tulagi.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 42 Anticipating a naval attack following several assaults by land-based Japanese aircraft, the Allied commander of the naval forces, Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, split his forces around Savo Island: Crutchley aboard HMAS Australia led Canberra, , and the destroyers and on patrol of the southern waters. At 20:45, Crutchley was recalled to meet urgently with US Admiral Richmond K. Turner, overall commander of the amphibious landings. Although Chicago was the senior ship after Australia departed, Canberra, which had been following Australia, found herself at point.Clark, The Fighting Canberras, p. 11 Around 01:00 on 9 August, the engines of scoutplanes from Mikawa's ships were heard, but as no warning came from the other groups, it was assumed they were friendly. American destroyers rescuing the surviving crew from Canberra after the Battle of Savo Island. USS Blue is alongside Canberra port bow, while USS Patterson is approaching from astern. At 01:45, Patterson detected Mikawa's ships and alerted the Allied force.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 43 The Japanese scout planes dropped flares to silhouette Canberra and Chicago. The Australian cruiser was able to avoid the Japanese torpedoes fired at the start of the engagement, but was on the receiving end of the Japanese cruisers' gunfire. The first two salvos killed or wounded several senior officers, disabled both engine rooms, damaged the bridge and 4-inch gun platform and forced the flooding of her 8-inch magazines. Within two minutes, the cruiser had been hit 24 times; she was immobilised, without power, and listing to starboard, with multiple internal fires and at least a fifth of her personnel dead or wounded.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 43‚Äì4 At least one torpedo strike was reported during the Japanese attack, although none of the 19 torpedoes fired at Canberra by the Japanese cruisers were recorded as hitting their target. Several personnel from Canberra believe that USS Bagley inadvertently torpedoed the cruiser.Mellefont, Two ships called Canberra, p. 5 From the 819-strong ship's company, 84 were killed (74 during the battle, 10 dying later from wounds), and another 109 were wounded.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 44 Canberra sinking, 9 August 1942 At 03:30, Patterson came alongside and relayed orders from Rear Admiral Turner: if Canberra could not achieve mobility by 06:30, she would be abandoned and sunk. The destroyer began to recover the Australian survivors, but at 04:30, Patterson detected an approaching ship. The destroyer moved to investigate, at which point the unknown ship opened fire, and Patterson retaliated. It was quickly realised that the attacker was USS Chicago, which had mistaken Canberra for a damaged Japanese vessel, and both ships ceased fire. Patterson returned to continue the evacuation, and was aided by sister ship .Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 45 While still afloat, and in no apparent danger of sinking, damage control and repair options were being evaluated. It was determined that Canberras engines could not be repaired by the 0630 deadline, and she was to be scuttled, instead of being towed over to Tulagi harbor for emergency repairs. She was torpedoed by the destroyer at 08:00, after 263 5-inch shells and four other torpedoes fired by failed to do the job, and sank at .Mellefont, Two ships called Canberra, p. 6 She was one of the first ships to be sunk in what was eventually named \\"Ironbottom Sound\\". Three US cruisers were also destroyed during the battle, and a US destroyer was damaged. Aftermath The US cruiser underway in 1961 Canberras wartime service was recognised with four battle honours: \\"East Indies 1940‚Äì41\\", \\"Pacific 1941‚Äì42\\", \\"Guadalcanal 1942\\", and \\"Savo Island 1942\\". Captain Howard Bode of USS Chicago was formally criticised for his actions during the battle, particularly for not taking lead when Australia departed, and for not warning the northern cruiser force of the approaching Japanese ships. In recognition of the valour displayed by the Australian ship and her company, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wished to commemorate the loss of HMAS Canberra by naming a US ship in her honour. The under-construction Baltimore-class cruiser Pittsburgh was selected to be renamed .Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 45, 129 The ship was launched on 19 April 1943 by (Alice,) Lady Dixon, the wife of Sir Owen Dixon, Australia's ambassador to the United States, and is the only United States warship to be named after a foreign capital city. Around the same time, the British government announced that the heavy cruiser (a sister ship to Canberra, but of the London subclass) would be transferred to the RAN as a gift.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 128 Although King George VI had announced that the ship would be renamed Canberra, the duplication of ship names with the United States Navy was against RAN policy. Although it was thought that Australia had a greater claim to the name, the Australian government decided to retain Shropshires old name after learning that the US offer had come directly from President Roosevelt.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 129 Many of the first Australian sailors posted to Shropshire in early 1943 were Canberra survivors. HMAS Canberra memorial in Canberra =Rediscovery= Canberras wreck was rediscovered and examined by Robert Ballard and his crew in July and August 1992, almost exactly fifty years after her scuttling. She lies upright on the ocean floor, approximately below sea level, and while her hull was basically intact, she shows visible signs of shell hits and fire damage amidships. Just as they were during the Battle of Savo Island, Canberras \\"B\\", \\"X\\" and \\"Y\\" turrets were trained to port, while \\"A\\" turret was trained on the port bow. When the ship was rediscovered in 1992, the forward superstructure had collapsed over to starboard side. Additionally, the roof of \\"B\\" turret was completely missing. =Memorials= HMAS Canberra is remembered in various places. In her name city of Canberra, a memorial is located next to Lake Burley Griffin,Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp 64‚Äì5 adjacent to the National Carillon. It incorporates a naval anchor and a section of chain cable (of the same type carried by Canberra), and it has two plaques detailing the purpose of the memorial and the details of the cruiser. The memorial was erected by the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Naval Historical Society, with donations from the ex-HMAS Canberra and Canberra-Shropshire Association members, and was unveiled on 9 August 1981 by Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot. A commemorative address was given at the unveiling by Admiral Sir Victor Smith, who was aboard Canberra at the time of her loss. Each year on the Saturday nearest 9 August, a service is conducted at the memorial, which is attended by the Australian Chief of Navy, the defence attach√©s from the United States and the United Kingdom, and personnel from the naval base . A catafalque party was originally provided by personnel from the frigate until the ship's 2005 decommissioning; after this, the catafalque party was supplied by the Australian Navy Cadets unit TS Canberra. HMAS Canberra memorial in Rove, Honiara Another memorial is located at the Police Memorial Park in Rove, Honiara, Solomon Islands. The memorial is shaped like the bow of a ship, and points toward Savo Island. A previous memorial to the ship, which had been located in the grounds of the Vilu Private Museum, was destroyed in 2000 during \\"the Tensions\\". A memorial plaque is also dedicated to HMAS Canberra and her Tasmanian RAN personnel at the Tasmanian Seafarers' Memorial at Triabunna on the east coast of Tasmania.

He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and posthumously the Victoria Cross. Early life and career Edwin Essery Swales was one of four children born in Inanda, Natal, South Africa to Harry Evelyn Swales, who was a farmer in the Heatonville district, and Olive Miriam Essery. Following the death of her husband in the influenza epidemic of 1918-19, Mrs Swales and her children moved to the Berea, Durban. Here, Edwin Swales attended Durban Preparatory High School and Durban High School (DHS). As a young lad, Edwin had also been a Boy Scout, at the 4th Durban Scout Troop. After leaving school, and prior to the Second World War, Edwin Swales worked for Barclays Bank (Dominion Colonial and Overseas - DCO) in Durban. Swales had joined the Natal Mounted Rifles before the War, rising to the rank of Sergeant Major, (officially, a Warrant Officer, 2nd Class). With the N.M.R., in the early part of the War, he saw action in Kenya, Abyssinia and in North Africa. He then transferred to the South African Air Force on 17 January 1942. Swales was also very keen on sport generally, and enjoyed rugby. He played for both civilian (pre-war) and various military teams. After playing for the DHS 2nd XV, he later played rugby for a number of South African and Dominion teams, whilst he was in the United Kingdom, during the War years. He played for Griquas when he had been posted to Kimberley for training. He was also a reserve for the Natal rugby team, without ever actually playing for the province. He received his wings at Kimberley on 26 June 1943. On 22 August 1943, he was seconded to the Royal Air Force (RAF) while retaining his South African Air Force uniform and rank. During the Second World War Following successful period of training on heavy bombers, Swales was posted, in June 1944, to the elite RAF Pathfinder Force (with 582 Squadron), part of No. 8 Pathfinder Group, at Little Staughton, in Huntingdonshire. It was normal for the Pathfinders to accept only experienced pilots who had completed a full tour on bombers. Although Swales had never spent any time as a bomber pilot in a standard heavy bomber squadron, Swales went straight into the Squadron. Swales' first operational flight for 582 Squadron was on 12 July 1944. Newly promoted to Captain on 4 November 1944, he took part in a daring daylight bombing raid on 23 December, on the Gremberg railway yards, Cologne, Germany. The Squadron Leader for the raid on Cologne was his close friend, Robert Palmer, D.F.C., who normally flew Mosquitos with 109 Squadron, also based at Little Staughton. Swales was the number two Pathfinder, leading the main flight and following Palmer as he marked the target. Palmer, who had completed 110 bombing raids, was killed as his Lancaster was damaged by German fighter and crashed. Six of the 30 aircraft on this operation were lost. Palmer was later awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross - becoming the 2nd Pathfinder pilot to be so honoured. For his actions on the Cologne raid, Edwin Swales was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The citation reads: Victoria Cross In 1945, while with the RAF Pathfinders (No. 582 Squadron), Swales was the Master Bomber and captain of Avro Lancaster III PB538.Record for Lancaster PB358 on lostaircraft.com On 23 February 1945, the very day as his D.F.C. award was gazetted, Swales led the bombing raid on Pforzheim, Germany (not far from Karlsruhe and the Rhine River), where 17,600 civilians were killed in 22 minutes. The 'sortie', his 43rd operational flight, consisted of 367 Lancasters supported by 13 Mosquitos. The marking and bombing, from a relatively low 8,000 feet (2440m), were accurate and severe damage was inflicted on Pforzheim: 1,825 tons (1854 tonnes) of bombs were dropped in 22 minutes. The post-war British Bombing Survey Unit estimated that 83% of the town's built-up area was destroyed, probably the greatest proportion of a city destroyed in any one raid during the war. Ten Lancasters were lost and two more crashed in France. Swales' aircraft was attacked by an Me110 whose fire shattered one engine and holed the fuel tanks. They were attacked again by the same fighter which knocked out a second engine. Swales decided to try and make it to friendly territory. The weather closed in and he ordered the crew to bail out. He attempted to put his Lancaster down but it stalled and crashed near Valenciennes, west of Prouvy, 3 km SSE of Denain in northern France killing him. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross ‚Äì the 3rd and last Pathfinder pilot to be so honoured. All had been posthumous. =Citation= Swales' VC citation reads: Legacy Originally buried at Fosse‚Äôs USA Cemetery, his remains now lie at the War Cemetery at Leopoldsburg, near Limburg, Belgium, Plot No.8, Row C, Grave No.5. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, KCB, OBE, AFC, of RAF Bomber Command, wrote a letter to Swales' mother, saying, inter-alia: Although often referred to as being a \\"Captain\\" at the time of his last flight, Swales was in fact an 'Acting' Major. The S.A.A.F. was using the army ranking system, hence the ranks of 'Captain' and of 'Major'. At the time of his death on 23 February 1945, Swales was aged 29 years. In 1958, the British Air Ministry wrote to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission informing them that the South African Air Force authorities had confirmed that at the time of his death, Swales had in fact held the rank of Major. The front page of the program for the opening of the S.A.A.F. Memorial in Pretoria on 31 May 1950, described Mrs. Olive Swales (who opened the Memorial) as being the \\"mother of the Late Major Edwin Swales, DFC, VC\\". Awards and recognition Swales was the only S.A.A.F. pilot during 1939-45 to be appointed a Pathfinder Master Bomber and also to have been posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The full list of the medals awarded to Swales follows: *The Victoria Cross *The Distinguished Flying Cross *The 1939‚Äì45 Star *The Africa Star *The France and Germany Star *The Defence Medal, 1939‚Äì1945 *The 1939‚Äì1945 War Medal (Victory Medal) *The Africa Service Medal Swales' full size war medals and some other possessions are held and displayed at the South African National Museum of Military History in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. At his old school, Durban High School (founded in 1866), a school 'House' is named Swales House. In the city of Durban, there was a major arterial road named 'Edwin Swales VC Drive'. In terms of a controversial decision made by the eThekwini Municipality, Swales' name was expunged, and the road's name changed to honour instead noted anti-apartheid figure Solomon Mahlangu. The original set of miniature medals belonging to Swales, and a silver model Lancaster Bomber, are now housed in an exhibition honouring Swales at his old school, Durban High School. Many years ago, the miniature medals and the model had been sold by a member of the Swales family. After changing hands a few times, the group came up for auction in London in July 2004, at which time the medals and model were sold to a UK collector. A medal collector and D.H.S. Old Boy tracked down the buyer and convinced him to sell his recent acquisitions to the School. After four months of negotiations, the medals and model were delivered to their new home at DHS, where they were first displayed on Armistice Day, 11 November 2004. The silver model Lancaster was one of only ten such models which were commissioned by the aircraft‚Äôs manufacturers, Messrs A.V. Roe & Co. and by Rolls Royce (suppliers of the Lancaster engines) and presented to the ten Victoria Cross winners (or their families) who flew Lancasters in the Second World War. On the base stand of the model is a silver plaque inscribed: \\"A Tribute from the Directors of A.V. Roe & Company and Rolls Royce Limited.

Features The camera's appearance was unique, as it lacked the ubiquitous SLR pentaprism \\"hump\\". Instead, a Porro prism system was used; it fitted sideways within the camera, with a sideways-swinging mirror, and located the viewfinder eyepiece to the left (seen from behind) relative to the lens centerline. The body was largely of ABS plastic over a metal frame; the lens mount was metal, and there was a metal covered area on the left top of the camera. This area also contained the onboard flash, which popped up and forward at the touch of a button. The onboard flash popup mechanism is manual. In low light scenarios the flash will not pop up automatically but the photographer must press the button and pop it up before taking the photo.

Likewise s was sometimes pronounced sh before /e/, not only before /i/, and the syllable „Çë (now read as e), was pronounced ye. On the other hand, the use of x to represent the sh sound is specific to the older pronunciations of Spanish and Portuguese. ; 1571‚Äì1622) was a kirishitan Japanese samurai and retainer of Date Masamune, the daimy≈ç of Sendai of Japanese imperial descent with ancestral ties to Emperor Kanmu. In the years 1613 through 1620, Hasekura headed a diplomatic mission to Pope Paul V. Crossing the Pacific aboard the San Juan Bautista, a ship built for the purpose by Masamune, Hasekura transited New Spain (arriving in Acapulco and departing from Veracruz) and visited Spain and various other ports-of-call in Europe on the way. This historic mission is called the Keich≈ç Embassy (), and follows the Tensh≈ç embassy () of 1582.In the name \\"Keich≈ç Embassy\\", the noun \\"Keich≈ç\\" refers to the neng≈ç (Japanese era name) after \\"Bunroku\\" and before \\"Genna.\\" In other words, the Keich≈ç Embassy commenced during Keich≈ç, which was a time period spanning the years from 1596 through 1615. On the return trip, Hasekura and his companions re-traced their route across New Spain in 1619, sailing from Acapulco for Manila, and then sailing north to Japan in 1620.Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Japan‚ÄìMexico Relations. He is conventionally considered the first Japanese ambassador in the Americas and in Spain.The Keich≈ç Embassy was, in fact, preceded by a Sengoku period mission headed by Mancio It≈ç with Alessandro Valignano in 1582‚Äì1590. Although less well-known and less well- documented, this historic mission is sometimes referred to as the \\"Tensh≈ç Embassy\\" because it was initiated in the Tensh≈ç era. This venture was organized by three daimy≈çs of Western Japan ‚Äì ≈åmura Sumitada, ≈åtomo S≈çrin and Arima Harunobu. Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially received in Spain and the Vatican, it happened at a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity. European monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan. Japan's next embassy to Europe would not occur until more than 200 years later, following two centuries of isolation, with the \\"First Japanese Embassy to Europe\\" in 1862. Early life Little is known of the early life of Hasekura Tsunenaga. According to Date Sejin Kafu (), he was of Japanese imperial descent, the child of Yamaguchi Tsuneshige (Â±±Âè£Â∏∏Êàê) who had ancestral ties with Emperor Kanmu. He was a mid-level noble samurai in the Sendai Domain in northern Japan, who had the opportunity to directly serve the daimy≈ç Date Masamune. He spent his young adulthood at the scenic Kamitate Castle () that was constructed in Hasekura Ward, Kawasaki City (ex-Hasekura Village), Miyagi Prefecture, by his grandfather Hasekura Tsunemasa (). The place of origin of the family name Hasekura was Hasekura Village (), now Hasekura Ward () in Kawasaki City. Hasekura and Date Masamune were of roughly the same age, and it is recorded that several important missions were given to Tsunenaga as his representative. Hasekura had an official coat of arms, consisting of a Buddhist swastika crossed by two arrows, within a shield and surmounted by a crown, on an orange background. It is also recorded that Hasekura served as a samurai during the Japanese invasion of Korea under the Taik≈ç Toyotomi Hideyoshi, for six months in 1597. In 1612, Hasekura's father, Hasekura Tsunenari (), was indicted for corruption, and he was put to death in 1613. His fief was confiscated, and his son should normally have been executed as well. Date, however, gave him the opportunity to redeem his honour by placing him in charge of the Embassy to Europe, and soon gave him back his territories as well. Background: early contacts between Japan and Spain The Spanish started trans-Pacific voyages between New Spain (present-day Mexico and the U.S. state of California) and the Philippines in 1565. The famous Manila galleons carried silver from Mexican mines westward to the entrep√¥t of Manila in the Spanish possession of the Philippines. There, the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods gathered from throughout Asia, including (until 1638) goods from Japan. The return route of the Manila galleons, first charted by the Spanish navigator Andr√©s de Urdaneta, took the ships northeast into the Kuroshio Current (also known as the Japan Current) off the coast of Japan, and then across the Pacific to the west coast of Mexico, landing eventually in Acapulco. Spanish ships were occasionally shipwrecked on the coasts of Japan due to bad weather, initiating contacts with the country. The Spanish wished to expand the Christian faith in Japan. Efforts to expand influence in Japan were met by stiff resistance from the Jesuits, who had started the evangelizing of the country in 1549, as well as by the opposition of the Portuguese and Dutch who did not wish to see Spain participate in Japanese trade. However, some Japanese, such as Christopher and Cosmas, are known to have crossed the Pacific onboard Spanish galleons as early as 1587. It is known that gifts were exchanged between the governor of the Philippines and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who thanks him in a 1597 letter, writing \\"The black elephant in particular I found most unusual.\\" In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco encountered bad weather on its way from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships would be allowed to visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court. =First Japanese expeditions to the Americas= 1610 San Buena Ventura William Adams originally reached Japan. A Franciscan friar named Luis Sotelo, who was proselytizing in the area of what is now modern Tokyo, convinced Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Tokugawa Hidetada to send him as a representative to New Spain (Mexico) on one of their ships, in order to advance the trade treaty. Rodrigo de Vivero offered to sail on the Japanese ship in order to guarantee the safety of their reception in New Spain, but insisted that another Franciscan, named Alonso Mu√±os, be sent instead as the sh≈çguns representative. In 1610, Rodrigo de Vivero, several Spanish sailors, the Franciscan father, and 22 Japanese representatives led by the trader Tanaka Sh≈çsuke sailed to Mexico aboard the San Buena Ventura, a ship built by the English navigator William Adams for the sh≈çgun. Once in New Spain, Alonso Mu√±os met with the Viceroy Luis de Velasco, who agreed to send an ambassador to Japan in the person of the famous explorer Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no with the added mission of exploring the \\"Gold and silver islands\\" (\\"\\") that were thought to be east of the Japanese isles. Vizca√≠no arrived in Japan in 1611 and had many meetings with the sh≈çgun and feudal lords. These encounters were tainted by his poor respect for Japanese customs, the mounting resistance of the Japanese towards Catholic proselytism, and the intrigues of the Dutch against Spanish ambitions. Vizca√≠no finally left to search for the \\"Silver island\\", during which search he encountered bad weather, forcing him to return to Japan with heavy damage. 1612 San Sebastian Without waiting for Vizca√≠no, another ship ‚Äì built in Izu by the Tokugawa shogunate under the minister of the Navy Mukai Sh≈çgen, and named San Sebastian ‚Äì left for Mexico on 9 September 1612 with Luis Sotelo onboard as well as two representatives of Date Masamune, with the objective of advancing the trade agreement with New Spain. However, the ship foundered a few miles from Uraga, and the expedition had to be abandoned. The 1613 embassy project A replica of the Japanese- built galleon San Juan Bautista, in Ishinomaki, Japan The sh≈çgun had a new galleon built in Japan to bring Vizca√≠no back to New Spain, together with a Japanese embassy accompanied by Luis Sotelo. The galleon, named Date Maru by the Japanese and later San Juan Bautista by the Spanish, took 45 days work in building, with the participation of technical experts from the Bakufu (the Minister of the Navy Mukai Sh≈çgen, an acquaintance of William Adams with whom he built several ships, dispatched his Chief Carpenter), 800 shipwrights, 700 smiths, and 3,000 carpenters. The daimy≈ç of Sendai, Date Masamune, was put in charge of the project. He named one of his retainers, Hasekura Tsunenaga (his fief was rated at around 600 koku), to lead the mission: :\\"The Great Ship left Toshima-Tsukinoura for the Southern Barbarians on 15 September Japanese calendar, with at its head Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga, and those called Imaizumi Sakan, Matsuki Shusaku, Nishi Kyusuke, Tanaka Taroemon, Nait≈ç Hanjur≈ç, Sonohoka Kyuemon, Kuranoj≈ç, Tonomo, Kitsunai, Kyuji, as well as several others under Rokuemon, as well as 40 Southern Barbarians, 10 men of Mukai Sh≈çgen, and also tradespeople, to a total 180.\\" (Records of the Date House, Keich≈ç-Genna , Gonoi p. 56) The objective of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements with the Spanish crown in Madrid, and to meet with the Pope in Rome. Date Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the Catholic religion in his domain: he invited Luis Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611. In his letter to the Pope, brought by Hasekura, he wrote: \\"I'll offer my land for a base of your missionary work. Send us as many padres as possible.\\" Sotelo, in his own account of the travels, emphasizes the religious dimension of the mission, claiming that the main objective was to spread the Christian faith in northern Japan: The San Juan Bautista is represented in Deruet's painting as a galleon with Hasekura's flag (red swastika on orange background) on the top mast (right: detail of the ship). :\\"I was formerly dispatched as ambassador of Idate Masamune, who holds the reins of the kingdom of Oxu [Japanese:] (which is in the Eastern part of Japan) ‚Äîwho, while he has not yet been reborn through baptism, has been catechized, and was desirous that the Christian faith should be preached in his kingdom‚Äîtogether with another noble of his Court, Philippus Franciscus Faxecura Rocuyemon, to the Roman Senate & to the one who at that time was in charge of the Apostolic See, His Holiness Pope Paul V.\\" (Luis Sotelo De Ecclesiae Iaponicae Statu Relatio, 1634).[sic] (p. 1) The embassy was probably, at that time, part of a plan to diversify and increase trade with foreign countries, before the participation of Christians in the Osaka rebellion triggered a radical reaction from the shogunate, with the interdiction of Christianity in the territories it directly controlled, in 1614. Trans-Pacific voyage Upon completion, the ship left on 28 October 1613 for Acapulco with around 180 people on board, including 10 samurai of the sh≈çgun (provided by the Minister of the Navy Mukai Sh≈çgen Tadakatsu), 12 samurai from Sendai, 120 Japanese merchants, sailors, and servants, and around 40 Spaniards and Portuguese, including Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no who, in his own words, only had the quality of a passenger.Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no \\"Account of the search for the gold and silver islands\\", quoted by Gonoi =New Spain (Acapulco)= The bay of Acapulco, where Hasekura Tsunenaga landed Nicol√°s de Cardona, in his 1632 report submitted to the king of Spain, included a view of the bay and city of Acapulco, mentioning the presence of \\"a ship from Japan\\" (letter \\"D\\"), probably the San Juan Bautista (Gonoi, p53). Cardona was in Acapulco between end of 1614 and March 21, 1615. The full legend reads: A. The ships of the expedition. B. The castle of San Diego. C. The town. D. A ship that has come from Japan. E. Los Manzanillos. F. El Grifo.Nicolas de Cardona \\"Geographic Descriptions\\", by Michael Mathes, p75 The ship first reached Cape Mendocino in today's California, and then continued along the coast to arrive in Acapulco on 25 January 1614 after three months at sea. The Japanese were received with great ceremony, but had to wait in Acapulco until orders were received regarding how to organize the rest of their travels. Fights erupted between the Japanese and the Spaniards, especially Vizca√≠no, apparently due to some disputes on the handling of presents from the Japanese ruler. A contemporary journal, written by the historian Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin, a noble Aztec born in Amecameca (ancient Chalco province) in 1579, whose formal name was Domingo Francisco de San Anton Mu√±on, relates Vizca√≠no was seriously wounded in the fight: :\\"Se√±or Vizca√≠no is still coming slowly, coming hurt; the Japanese injured him when they beat and stabbed him in Acapulco, as became known here in Mexico, because of all the things coming along that had been made his responsibility in Japan\\"\\"Annals of his time\\", p275 Following these fights, orders were promulgated on 4 and 5 March to bring peace back. The orders explained that: :\\"The Japanese should not be submitted to attacks in this Land, but they should remit their weapons until their departure, except for Hasekura Tsunenaga and eight of his retinue ... The Japanese will be free to go where they want, and should be treated properly. They should not be abused in words or actions. They will be free to sell their goods. These orders have been promulgated to the Spanish, the Indians, the Mulattos, the Mestizos, and the Blacks, and those who don't respect them will be punished\\".\\"5th document\\", quoted from \\"Hasekura Tsunanaga\\", Gonoi, p77 =New Spain (Mexico)= The embassy remained two months in Acapulco and entered Mexico City on 24 March, where it was received with great ceremony. The ultimate mission for the embassy was to go on to Europe. The embassy spent some time in Mexico, and then went to Veracruz to board the fleet of Don Antonio Oquendo. Chimalpahin gives some account of the visit of Hasekura. :\\"This is the second time that the Japanese have landed one of their ships on the shore at Acapulco. They are transporting here all things of iron, and writing desks, and some cloth that they are to sell here.\\"Chimalpahin \\"Annals of his time\\", 4 March 1614, p275 :\\"It became known here in Mexico and was said that the reason their ruler the Emperor of Japan sent this said lordly emissary and ambassador here, is to go in Rome to see the Holy Father Paul V, and to give him their obedience concerning the holy church, so that all the Japanese want to become Christians\\" (Chimalpahin, \\"Annals of His Time\\").Chimalpahin \\"Annals of his time\\", 24 March 1614, p275 Mexico City around the time of Hasekura's visit. 1628 painting. Hasekura was settled in a house next to the Church of San Francisco, and met with the Viceroy. He explained to him that he was also planning to meet King Philip III to offer him peace and to obtain that the Japanese could come to Mexico for trade. On Wednesday 9 April, 20 Japanese were baptized, and 22 more on 20 April by the archbishop in Mexico, don Juan P√©rez de la Serna, at the Church of San Francisco. Altogether 63 of them received confirmation on 25 April. Hasekura waited for his travel to Europe to be baptized there: :\\"But the lordly emissary, the ambassador, did not want to be baptized here; it was said that he will be baptized later in Spain\\"Chimalpahin \\"Annals of his time\\", 9 April 1614, p277 Departure for Europe Chimalpahin explains that Hasekura left some of his compatriots behind before leaving for Europe: :\\"The Ambassador of Japan set out and left for Spain. In going he divided his vassals; he took a certain number of Japanese, and he left an equal number here as merchants to trade and sell things.\\"Chimalpahin \\"Annals of his time\\", 29 May 1614, p283 The fleet left for Europe on the San Jose on 10 June. Hasekura had to leave the largest parts of the Japanese group behind, who were to wait in Acapulco for the return of the embassy. Some of them, as well as those from the previous travel of Tanaka Sh≈çsuke, returned to Japan the same year, sailing back with the San Juan Bautista: :\\"Today, Tuesday the 14th of the month of October of the year 1614, was when some Japanese set out from Mexico here going home to Japan.; they lived here in Mexico for four years. Some still remained here; they earn a living trading and selling here the goods they brought with them from Japan.\\"Chimalpahin \\"Annals of his time\\", 14 October 1614, p291 =Cuba= The embassy stopped and changed ships in Havana in Cuba in July 1614. The embassy stayed in Havana for six days. A bronze statue was erected on 26 April 2001 at the head of Havana Bay. Mission to Europe =Spain= Hasekura in prayer, following his conversion in Madrid in 1615 The fleet arrived in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda on 5 October 1614. :\\"The fleet arrived safely finally, after some dangers and storms, to the port of Sanl√∫car de Barrameda on 5 October, where the Duke of Medina Sidonia was advised of the arrival. He sent carriages to honor them and accommodate the Ambassador and his gentlemen\\" (Scipione Amati \\"History of the Kingdom of Voxu\\"). (Scipione Amati, \\"Historia del regno di Voxu\\", 1615) :\\"The Japanese ambassador Hasekura Rokuemon, sent by Joate Masamune, king of Boju, entered Seville on Wednesday, 23 October 1614. He was accompanied by 30 Japanese with blades, their captain of the guard, and 12 bowmen and halberdiers with painted lances and blades of ceremony. The captain of the guard was Christian and was called Don Thomas, the son of a Japanese martyr\\" (Library Capitular Colombina 84-7-19 Memorias..., fol.195).\\"(Biblioteca Capitular Calombina 84-7-19 .Memorias..., fol.195)\\" Historic letter from the first Japanese embassy to Spain, kept at Seville Town Hall The Japanese embassy met with King Philip III in Madrid on 30 January 1615. Hasekura remitted to the King a letter from Date Masamune, as well as offer for a treaty. The King responded that he would do what he could to accommodate these requests. Hasekura was baptized on 17 February by the king's personal chaplain, and renamed Felipe Francisco Hasekura. The baptism ceremony was to have been conducted by the Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, though he was too ill to actually carry this out, and the Duke of Lerma ‚Äì the main administrator of Phillip III's rule and the de facto ruler of Spain ‚Äì was designated as Hasekura's godfather. The embassy stayed eight months in Spain before leaving the country for Italy. =France= Depiction of Hasekura's visit in the 17th century German edition of Scipione Amati's 1615 book, the History of the Kingdom of Woxu. Hasekura's blason in the top right corner. After traveling across Spain, the embassy sailed on the Mediterranean aboard three Spanish frigates towards Italy. Due to bad weather, they had to stay for a few days in the French harbour of Saint-Tropez, where they were received by the local nobility, and made quite a sensation on the populace. The visit of the Japanese Embassy is recorded in the city's chronicles as led by \\"Philip Francis Faxicura, Ambassador to the Pope, from Date Masamunni, King of Woxu in Japan\\". Many picturesque details of their movements were recorded: :\\"They never touch food with their fingers, but instead use two small sticks that they hold with three fingers.\\" :\\"They blow their noses in soft silky papers the size of a hand, which they never use twice, so that they throw them on the ground after usage, and they were delighted to see our people around them precipitate themselves to pick them up.\\" :\\"Their swords cut so well that they can cut a soft paper just by putting it on the edge and by blowing on it.\\" :(\\"Relations of Mme de St Tropez\\", October 1615, Biblioth√®que Inguimbertine, Carpentras).Extracts from the Old French original: *\\"\\". *\\"\\". *\\"\\". *\\"\\" (Marcouin, Francis and Keiko Omoto.

Vatican The Japanese Embassy went on to Italy where they were able to meet with Pope Paul V in Rome in November 1615, the same year Galileo Galilei was first confronted by the Roman Inquisition regarding his findings against geocentricism. Hasekura remitted to the Pope two gilded letters, one in Japanese and one in Latin, containing a request for a trade treaty between Japan and Mexico and the dispatch of Christian missionaries to Japan. These letters are still visible in the Vatican archives. The Latin letter, probably written by Luis Sotelo for Date Masamune, reads, in part: :Kissing the Holy feet of the Great, Universal, Most Holy Lord of The Entire World, Pope Paul, in profound submission and reverence, I, Idate Masamune, King of W≈çsh≈´ in the Empire of Japan, suppliantly say: :The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to our country to spread the faith of God. On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven't accomplished this desire due to some small issues. However, in order to encourage my subjects to become Christians, I wish that you send missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that you will be able to build a church and that your missionaries will be protected. I also wish that you select and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva Espa√±a are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas.\\" Translation of the Latin letter of Date Masamune to the Pope.Body of the text translated from Gonoi quote, p152. Translation of the salutation was done separately. The original Latin of the introduction is as follows: Letter title [SISQ3 = ] totius Orbis Patris Domini Pape Pauli s. pedes cum profunda summisse et reuerentia [ prob. = , prob. = ] Title of Roman Noble and Roman Citizenship dedicated to \\"Faxecura Rokuyemon\\" (click image for transcription and translation) The Pope agreed to the dispatch of missionaries, but left the decision for trade to the King of Spain. The Roman Senate also gave to Hasekura the honorary title of Roman Noble and Roman Citizen, in a document he brought back to Japan, and which is preserved today in Sendai. Hasekura conversing with the Franciscan Luis Sotelo, surrounded by other members of the embassy, in a fresco showing the \\"glory of Pope Paul V\\". Sala Regia, Quirinal Palace, Rome, 1615. Sotelo also described the visit to the Pope, book (published posthumously in 1634): :\\"When we got there by the aid of God in the Year of Our Salvation 1615, not only were we kindly received by His Holiness the great Pope, with the Holy College of the Cardinals and a gathering of bishops and nobles, and even the joy and general happiness of the Roman People, but we and three others (whom the Japanese Christians had specially designated to announce their condition with respect to the Christian religion) were heard, rested, and just as we were hoping, dispatched as quickly as possible.\\" (Sotelo, ). (p. 1) =Rumours of political intrigue= Besides the official description of Hasekura's visit to Rome, some contemporary communications tend to indicate that political matters were also discussed, and that an alliance with Date Masamune was suggested as a way to establish Christian influence in the whole of Japan: :\\"The Ambassador strongly insisted that the authority and power of his ruler was superior to that of many European countries\\" (Anonymous Roman communication, dated 10 October 1615) :\\"The Franciscan Spanish fathers are explaining that the King of the Ambassador [Hasekura Tsunenaga] will soon become the supreme ruler of his country, and that, not only will they become Christians and follow the will of the church of Rome, but they will also in turn convert the rest of the population. This is why they are requesting the dispatch of a high eclesiastic together with the missionaries. Because of this, many people have been doubting the true purpose of the embassy, and are wondering if they are not looking for some other benefit.\\" (Letter of the Venetian ambassador, 7 November 1615). =Second visit to Spain= Letter of the King of Spain to Date Masamune (1616). The letter is friendly and asks for the support of the Christian faith, but does not mention trade, in spite of Date Masamune's own request (draft, preserved in the Seville archives, General Archive of the Indies). For the second time in Spain, in April 1616 Hasekura met again with the King, who declined to sign a trade agreement, on the ground that the Japanese Embassy did not appear to be an official embassy from the ruler of Japan Tokugawa Ieyasu, who, on the contrary, had promulgated an edict in January 1614 ordering the expulsion of all missionaries from Japan, and started the persecution of the Christian faith in Japan. Two years later, after their trip around Europe, the mission left Seville for New Spain (Mexico) in June 1616. Certain registration documents indicate that some Japanese could have stayed in Spain, which is possible given that they made their last stop in villages near Seville (Espartinas ABCDESEVILA. ¬´Presentado el libro ¬´La estancia de la Embajada Keicho en Espartinas¬ª¬ª. abcdesevilla.es.

The Italian writer Scipione Amati, who accompanied the embassy in 1615 and 1616, published in 1615 in Rome a book titled History of the Kingdom of Woxu. This book was also translated into German in 1617. In 1616, the French publisher Abraham Savgrain published an account of Hasekura's visit to Rome: \\"\\" (\\"Account of the solemn and remarkable entrance in Rome of Dom Philippe Francois Faxicura\\").

Image:Faxicura.jpgPrint depicting Hasekura, with legend in Latin. =Return to Mexico= Hasekura stayed in Mexico for 5 months on his way back to Japan. The San Juan Bautista had been waiting in Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip across the Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Sh≈çgen, she was laden with fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. To avoid too much silver leaving Mexico for Japan, the Spanish king requested that the Viceroy ask for the proceeds to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver, which Hasekura and Yokozawa respectively were allowed to bring back with them. =Philippines= In April 1618, the San Juan Bautista arrived in the Philippines from Mexico, with Hasekura and Luis Sotelo on board. The ship was acquired by the Spanish government there, with the objective of building up defenses against incursions from Protestant powers. In Manila, the archbishop described the deal to the king of Spain in a missive dated 28 July 1619: Letter of Hasekura to his son, written during his stay in the Philippines, Sendai City Museum :\\"The Governor was extremely friendly with the Japanese, and provided them with his protection. As they had many expensive things to buy, they decided to lend their ship. The ship was immediately furbished for combat. The Governor eventually bought the ship, because it turned out that it was of excellent and sturdy construction, and available ships were dramatically few. In favour of your Majesty, the price paid was reasonable.\\" (Document 243) During his stay in the Philippines, Hasekura purchased numerous goods for Date Masamune, and built a ship, as he explained in a letter he wrote to his son. He finally returned to Japan in August 1620, reaching the harbour of Nagasaki. Return to Japan By the time Hasekura came back, Japan had changed quite drastically: an effort to eradicate Christianity had been under way since 1614, Tokugawa Ieyasu had died in 1616 and been replaced by his more xenophobic son Tokugawa Hidetada, and Japan was moving towards the \\"Sakoku\\" policy of isolation. Because news of these persecutions arrived in Europe during Hasekura's embassy, European rulers ‚Äì especially the King of Spain ‚Äì became very reluctant to respond favorably to Hasekura's trade and missionary proposals. Painting of the Pope Paul V remitted by Hasekura Tsunenaga to Date Masamune during his 1620 report; Sendai City Museum Indonesian kris and Ceylonese dagger (acquired in the Philippines), presented by Hasekura to Date Masamune upon his return; Sendai City Museum Hasekura reported his travels to Date Masamune upon his arrival in Sendai. It is recorded that he remitted a portrait of Pope Paul V, a portrait of himself in prayer (shown above), and a set of Ceylonese and Indonesian daggers acquired in the Philippines, all preserved today in the Sendai City Museum. The \\"Records of the House of Masamune\\" describe his report in a rather succinct manner, ending with a rather cryptic expression of surprise bordering on the outrage (\\"\\") at Hasekura's discourse: :\\"Rokuemon went to the country of the Southern Barbarians, he paid his respects to the king Paolo, he stayed there for several years, and now he sailed back from Luzon. He brought paintings of the king of the Southern Barbarians, and a painting of himself, which he remitted. Many of his descriptions of the Southern Barbarian countries, and the meaning of Rokuemon's declarations were surprising and extraordinary.\\"\\"\\" (\\"Records of the House of Masamune\\") =Interdiction of Christianity in Sendai= The direct effect of Hasekura's return to Sendai was the interdiction of Christianity in the Sendai fief two days later: :\\"Two days after the return of Rokuemon to Sendai, a three-point edict against the Christian was promulgated: first, that all Christians were ordered to abandon their faith, in accordance with the rule of the sh≈çgun, and for those who did not, they would be exiled if they were nobles, and killed if they were citizens, peasants or servants. Second, that a reward would be given for the denunciation of hidden Christians. Third that propagators of the Christian faith should leave the Sendai fief, or else, abandon their religion\\" (November 1620 letter of father Angelis, Japan-China archives of the Jesuits in Rome, quoted in Gonoi's \\"Hasekura Tsunenaga\\", p231) What Hasekura said or did to bring about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to indicate that he and his descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic ‚Äì and to a certain extent, disturbing ‚Äì account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring in the rest of the country. Date Masamune suddenly chose to distance himself from the Western faith. The first executions of Christians started 40 days later. The anti-Christian measures taken by Date Masumune were, however, comparatively mild, and Japanese and Western Christians repeatedly claimed that he only took them to appease the sh≈çgun: :\\"Date Masumune, out of fear of the sh≈çgun, ordered the persecution of Christianity in his territory, and created several martyrs.\\" (Letter of 17 prominent Japanese Christians from Sendai, to the Pope, 29 September 1621).Quoted in Gonoi p229 One month after Hasekura's return, Date Masamune wrote a letter to the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Hidetada, in which he makes a very clear effort to evade responsibility for the embassy, explaining in detail how it was organized with the approval, and even the collaboration, of the sh≈çgun: :\\"When I sent a ship to the Southern Barbarian countries several years ago, upon the advice of Mukai Sh≈çgen, I also dispatched the Southern Barbarian named Sotelo, who had resided for several years in Edo. At that time, your highness also gave messages for the Southern Barbarians, as well as presents, such as folding screens and sets of armour.\\" (18 October 1620, quoted in Gonoi, p. 234). Spain, with a colony and an army in the nearby Philippines, was a source of concern for Japan at that time. Hasekura's eyewitness accounts of Spanish power and colonial methods in New Spain (Mexico) may have precipitated the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Hidetada's decision to sever trade relations with Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish embassy also contributed to the decision. =Death= What became of Hasekura is unknown and accounts of his last years are numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could rely only on hearsay, with some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, others that he was martyred for his faith, and others that he practised Christianity in secret. The fate of his descendants and servants, who were later executed for being Christians, suggests that Hasekura remained strongly Christian and transmitted his faith to the members of his family. The Buddhist grave of Hasekura Tsunenaga, still visible today in Enfuku-ji, „Äí 989-1507 Miyagi Prefecture, Iwata-gun, Kawasaki Town (Ench≈çzan, Miyagi). Sotelo, who returned to Japan but was caught and finally burnt at the stake in 1624, gave before his execution an account of Hasekura returning to Japan as a hero who propagated the Christian faith: :\\"My other colleague, the ambassador Philippus Faxecura, after he reached his aforementioned king (Date Masamune), was greatly honored by him, and sent to his own estate, to rest after such a long and tiring journey, where he made his wife, children, servants, and many other vassals into Christians, and advised other nobles who were his kith and kin to accept the faith, which they indeed did. While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his return, having provided much instruction and a great example, with much preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, and the protection of the religious (i.e. \\"members of religious orders\\") in that kingdom. The King and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the Christians and Religious, who knew very well the virtue and religious zeal of this man. This is what I heard by letters from the very Religious who administered the sacraments to him, and who had been present at his death, as well as from others.\\" (Luis Sotelo, De ecclesiae Iaponicae statu relatio).[sic] (p. 16) Hasekura also brought back to Japan several Catholic artifacts, but he did not give them to his ruler, and instead kept them on his own estate. Hasekura Tsunenaga died of illness (according to Japanese as well as Christian sources) in 1622, but the location of his grave is not known for certain. Three graves are claimed as Hasekura's in Miyagi. The most likely is in the outskirts of ≈åsato town () in the temple of Saik≈ç-ji (). Another is visible in the Buddhist temple of Enfuku-ji () in Kawasaki town. Another is clearly marked (along with a memorial to Sotelo) in the cemetery of the temple of K≈çmy≈ç-ji () in Kitayama Aoba-ku (Sendai). =Execution of his descendants and servants= Cross and medal seized in Hasekura's estate in 1640 Rosaries found in Hasekura's estate in 1640 Hasekura had a son, named Rokuemon Tsuneyori. Two of his son's servants, Yogoemon (‰∏é‰∫îÂè≥Ë°õÈñÄ) and his wife, were convicted of being Christian but refused to recant their faith under torture (reverse hanging, called \\"tsurushi\\") and as a result died in August 1637 (as the lives of Christians were spared if they recanted, these executions indicate that they were steadfast and refused to deny their faith). In 1637, Rokuemon Tsuneyori himself also came under suspicion of Christianity after being denounced by someone from Edo, but escaped questioning because he was the master of the Zen temple of Komyoji (). In 1640, two other servants of Tsuneyori, Tar≈çzaemon (Â§™ÈÉéÂ∑¶Ë°õÈñÄ, 71), who had followed Hasekura to Rome, and his wife (59), were convicted of being Christians, and, also refusing to recant their faith under torture, died. Tsuneyori was held responsible this time and decapitated the same day, at the age of 42, for having failed to denounce Christians under his roof, although it remained unconfirmed whether he was himself Christian or not.\\"National Treasure: Documents of the Keicho Embassy to Europe\\", p80 Also, two Christian priests, the Dominican Pedro Vazquez and Joan Bautista Paulo, had given his name under torture. Tsuneyori's younger brother, Tsunemichi, was convicted as a Christian, but managed to flee and disappear. The privileges of the Hasekura family were abolished at this point by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized. It is at this time, in 1640, that Hasekura's Christian artifacts were confiscated, and they were kept in custody in Sendai until they were rediscovered at the end of the 19th century. Altogether, around fifty Christian artifacts were found in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns, and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, but they have been lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai. Tsuneyori's son, Tsunenobu (Â∏∏‰ø°), grandson of Tsunenaga Hasekura, survived. He founded a Hasekura family line that continues to the present day. The first to 10th heads of the Hasekura Family lived in Osato-city, Miyagi Prefecture. The 11th head moved to Wakabayashi Ward, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture where the present 13th head, Tsunetaka Hasekura, resides. The 13th head actively works in both Miyagi and Akita Prefectures. Re-discovery The very existence of the travels of Hasekura was forgotten in Japan until the reopening of the country after the Sakoku policy of isolation. In 1873, a Japanese embassy to Europe (the Iwakura mission) headed by Iwakura Tomomi heard for the first time of the travels of Hasekura when shown documents during their visit to Venice in Italy.Source: Sendai museum monograph. Description of the visit of the Hasekura mission to the Venice archives Text (Japanese) =Hasekura today= Today, there are statues of Hasekura Tsunenaga in the outskirts of Acapulco in Mexico, at the entrance of Havana Bay in Cuba, in Coria del R√≠o in Spain, in the Church of Civitavecchia in Italy, in Tsukinoura, near Ishinomaki, and two in Osato town in Miyagi. Approximately 700 inhabitants of Coria del R√≠o bear the surname Jap√≥n (originally Hasekura de Jap√≥n), identifying them as descendants of the members of Hasekura Tsunenaga's delegation.\\"Spain's Japon clan has reunion to trace its 17th century roots\\", Japan Times, 11 December 2003 A theme park describing the embassy and displaying a replica of the San Juan Bautista was established in the harbour of Ishinomaki, from which Hasekura initially departed on his voyage. Today there stands a statue of Hasekura in a park in Manila, the Philippines. Sh≈´saku End≈ç wrote a 1980 novel, titled The Samurai, a fictitious account relating the travels of Hasekura. The 1991 film Journey of Honor (aka Kabuto, aka Shogun Mayeda) starring Sho Kosugi was loosely based on Hasekura's expedition and recounts the adventures of a samurai journey from Japan to Spain. A 2005 animation film produced in Spain and titled Gisaku relates the adventures of a young Japanese samurai named Yohei who visited Spain in the 17th century, in a story loosely taking its inspiration from the travels of Hasekura. Yohei survived in hiding to the present day due to magical powers (\\"After centuries of lethargy, he awakes in a World he does not know\\"), and accomplishes many adventures in modern Europe as a superhero. The 2017 fictional historical novel The Samurai of Seville by John J. Healey recounts the travels of Hasekura and his delegation of 21 samurai. A 2019 sequel entitled The Samurai's Daughter tells the story of a young woman born to one of the samurai and a Spanish lady, and her journey to Japan with her father following her mother's death.

It is the capital of Dƒôbica County. Since 1999 it has been situated in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship; it had previously been in the Tarn√≥w Voivodeship (1975‚Äì1998). Dƒôbica belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, and for centuries it was part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship. Area and location According to the 2006 data, Dƒôbica's area is . Arable land makes 42% of the area of the town, while forests make 19%. Dƒôbica is the seat of the county, and the town covers 4.34% of the county's area. Dƒôbica lies at the border of two geographical regions of Poland - the Carpathian Piedmont in southern districts of the town, and the Sandomierz Basin in its north, along the Wis≈Çoka river. Economy Since the mid-1930s Dƒôbica, in spite of its size, has been a large industrial hub. A number of companies were then created thanks to governmental industry development programs. Most of them still exist today, though they were privatized in the 1990s: * Firma Oponiarska Dƒôbica S.A. (Tire Company Dƒôbica) now owned by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, previous name - Stomil Dƒôbica * Lerg S.A. - a chemical manufacturer located in the village of Pustk√≥w, a village in Dƒôbica County * Tikkurila Polska S.A. (formerly Polifarb Dƒôbica) - a paint manufacturer * Wytw√≥rnia UrzƒÖdze≈Ñ Ch≈Çodniczych WUCh (Freezer Appliances Producer WUCh) * Zak≈Çady Miƒôsne (Meatworks) Since the early 1990s a relatively large number (in proportion to the city's size) of successful companies have been started and run by local residents: * bicycle, motorcycle and electric car manufacturer Arkus and Romet Group * Sportatut - producer of sports nutritionals * chemical industry manufacturers (paint producers such as ≈önie≈ºka Brzeznica and Plastbud Pustk√≥w) * marble producer Jabo Marmi and brickyard Igloobud * food companies such as Igloomeat and Animex Poludnie Transport The A4 highway runs just to the north of the city. There are two exits from the highway into Dƒôbica. The section of the highway going westwards from Dƒôbica to Tarn√≥w was completed in October 2014. In result, the city has now a direct highway connection with the western Polish border and in consequence with all of Western Europe. A car journey to Krak√≥w (approximately 120 km) takes around an hour, while Rzesz√≥w, the capital of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship located to the East of Dƒôbica, can be easily reached in less than 30 minutes. Dƒôbica is also located by the 94 country road, which was formerly part of the European route E40. This two-lane road has been renovated in recent years. However, with the completion of the A4 highway, it lost its former significance. Dƒôbica is also connected with the cities of Mielec and Tarnobrzeg thanks to the local road number 985. Dƒôbica lies by an important railway line stretching between the western and eastern Polish borders. It is currently undergoing an upgrade (to be completed by 2016) for the maximum train speeds of 160 km/h. As of now due to the construction work, a 111 km train journey to Krak√≥w takes approximately 1.5 hours. Between 1988 and 1990 Dƒôbica had been connected with Straszƒôcin by trolleybus line. Education Dƒôbica has been home to two branches of higher education institutions: * Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Informatyki i ZarzƒÖdzania in Rzesz√≥w, branch in Dƒôbica * University of Economics in Krak√≥w, branch in Dƒôbica History Kazimierz Wielki giving ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çaw Gryfita permission to establish Dƒôbica =Middle Ages= One of the oldest documented references to this area dates back to the year 1293. It records a settlement by the name of Dambicha, belonging to the noble Gryfita family. In 1305, the village was raided by the Tatars, who burned a wooden church. The church was rebuilt in 1318, and by 1325, Dƒôbica was the seat of a deanery, located on the outskirts of the mighty Sandomierz Forest. The Dƒôbica Deanery consisted of fourteen parishes, among them Przec≈Çaw, Sƒôdzisz√≥w Ma≈Çopolski, and Strzy≈º√≥w. In 1358 King Casimir III the Great gave a local nobleman ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çaw Gryfita permission to found a town, and Dƒôbica received town rights, together with a privilege to organize weekly markets on Wednesdays. The town, however, was not actually founded until June 10, 1372, when Miko≈Çaj of Lipiny was named its first w√≥jt. Dƒôbica was conveniently located along the main merchant route from Krak√≥w to Lw√≥w, but the newly established town was unable to compete with older urban centers of the area, Pilzno and Ropczyce. In 1446, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland allowed annual fairs to be organized on Ash Wednesdays, which resulted in the quick development of the town. For many years however, Dƒôbica was a small town, located in the Pilzno County, Sandomierz Voivodeship, province of Lesser Poland. Lacking a defensive wall that would defend it, it was vulnerable to invasions of the Tatars, Swedes, and Hungarians, who burnt or ransacked the town every few years. As a result of these events, there are few historical monuments in Dƒôbica. One of these is the Saint Jadwiga church, originally from the 14th century, but completely rebuilt in the late 19th century. Church of St. Jadwiga first erected in the 14th century In 1474, Dƒôbica, together with other towns of southern Lesser Poland, was ransacked by the Black Army of Hungary. In 1502, a Crimean Tatar raid caused widespread destruction, and as a result of it, the town was burned and depopulated. =Early modern era= To prevent the complete disappearance of Dƒôbica, its owners exempted residents from all taxes for 14 years, also allowing them to collect free timber and firewood in local forests. In 1504, Dƒôbica was exempted from royal taxes by King Alexander Jagiellon. Due to all these privileges, Dƒôbica emerged in the 16th century as a local center of skilled craftsmen. Still, it was much smaller than Pilzno and Ropczyce, also because it remained a private town, whose owners argued with each other. In 1554, most of Dƒôbica burned down, together with the wooden parish church of St. Margaret. In the late 16th century, the population of the town was app. 700. Like almost all Lesser Poland's towns and cities, Dƒôbica was completely destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, when Swedes and Transylvanians of George II Rakoczi burned and ransacked the town (1655 - 1660). After the invasion, the population of Dƒôbica was reduced to app. 200, with only 30 houses. As a result, the owners of the town allowed the first Jews to settle in Dƒôbica. The first settlers arrived in 1676‚Äì1690. They expanded the town's population, and had a positive influence on the town's economy. In the late 17th century, the so-called New Dƒôbica was established, around the now non-existing St. Barbara church, app. one kilometre () west of Old Dƒôbica. Both Dƒôbicas had different mayors, who were governed by one w√≥jt. In the course of time, the towns merged, and the market square of New Dƒôbica now serves as the center of the town. Dƒôbica was completely destroyed during the Great Northern War, and the destruction was so severe that the town slowly turned into a farming village. In the late 18th century, it belonged to the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. =Late modern era= A battle between Poles and Russians took place here during the Bar Confederation, and in 1772, as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Dƒôbica was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of newly established Galicia, where it remained until November 1918. Austrian authorities decided that it should no longer be regarded as a town, but rather a village and renamed it Dembitz. This decision marked the decline of the town. Dƒôbica's oldest high school in the early 20th century Bad times came to an end in the second half of the 19th century, when the Austrian government decided to build a main West-East railroad line (see Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis), connecting two major urban centres of Galicja - Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w. A railroad station was built in Dƒôbica, and at the end of the 19th century, another, northbound line was constructed, joining Dƒôbica and the town of Sandomierz, which was located on the Austrian-Russian boundary. The town became a rail junction, which was a huge boost for its citizens. In 1900 a high school was opened, and in 1908 students from this school founded one of the oldest sports clubs in Poland, Wis≈Çoka Dƒôbica (whose name comes from the River Wis≈Çoka, which flows by the town). Just before World War I, Dƒôbica was again incorporated as a town. The war was a disaster for the town, as it was almost completely destroyed. During several campaigns, Dƒôbica was occupied by Russian, Austrian, Hungarian and German troops, which fought in this area for many months in 1914 - 1915. The Entente Powers wanted to get through the Carpathian Range towards Slovakia, Bohemia and Hungary, while the Central Powers managed to stop them at the beginning of 1915. These events had a great impact on the town and hampered its development for many years. In 1918, after Poland regained independence, Dƒôbica was included in the Krak√≥w Voivodeship, in the county of Ropczyce. The economic situation of the town did not change - there was no industry, very few jobs available and surrounding villages were strongly overpopulated. This started to change in 1936, when Polish government announced the creation of the Central Industrial Area. It was a huge public works project, aimed at fighting unemployment in this overpopulated part of Poland, as well as creating heavy industry, concentrated on the production of arms. Dƒôbica started to develop very fast; so fast, that in 1937 the county's capital was moved here from Ropczyce. Among several factories built in the town at that time, the most important was Stomil (now called Tire Company Dƒôbica, and belonging to the Goodyear). Other factories were: Wytw√≥rnia UrzƒÖdze≈Ñ Ch≈Çodniczych WUCh and Zak≈Çady Tworzyw Sztucznych \\"Pustk√≥w\\", built from scratch, together with a workers' settlement, in Pustk√≥w Osiedle, northeast of Dƒôbica. Some time in 1938 or 1939 work on another rail connection from Dƒôbica to Jas≈Ço, via Pilzno was started. the Second World War stopped this construction, and after the war it was not continued. =World War II= The occupation of Dƒôbica by Nazi Germany started on September 8, 1939. The Germans created a ghetto for the town's Jewish population, eventually killing most of them either on the spot or in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In the forested hills south of the town, strong underground forces operated, with numerous units of the Home Army (AK). It was too dangerous for AK officers to stay in Dƒôbica, thus the headquarters of a local underground district (known as Deser) were located at a nearby village of Gumniska, located in the hilly area south of the town. Resistance fighters were very active here, often attacking the main Krak√≥w-Lw√≥w rail line, used by German troops. In early 1944, units of the local Armia Krajowa district unsuccessfully tried to blow up a train with Hans Frank, which was passing through the village station at Czarna Tarnowska, some west of Dƒôbica. As a reprisal, on February 2, 1944, the Germans murdered 50 Poles by the rail track in Dƒôbica (also see Otto Schimek). in the village of Pustk√≥w On the outskirts of Dƒôbica in the village of Pustk√≥w near Blizna and several neighboring ones, the Germans established a massive military base in the fall of 1941 for weapons testing and the training of new Ukrainian collaborationist military formations including the SS Galizien Division. It is estimated that over the duration of the SS Heidelager training base operation, some 15,000 slave-labour prisoners perished there, including 7,500 Jews, 5,000 Soviet POWs, and 2,500 Poles, on top of an estimated 1,000 Soviet soldiers who died in the area during the Nazi-Soviet war. Their remains are buried in the cemetery along the road to Pustk√≥w Drips. Originally, the cemetery was located inside the ring IV (DƒÖbr√≥wki). Later, the graves of soldiers were exhumed and moved. A Russian colonel killed in the fighting is buried in one of the tombs. Implicated in war crimes was SS-man Alois Kurz (ID 382378) who, from 1940 to 21 April 1941, served in the SS Regiment Westland, then was assigned to a construction battalion for the SS training ground and labor camp serving the SS Truppenubungsplatz Heidelager (de) in Pustk√≥w. Also implicated in war crimes was Wilhelm Schitli, commander of the \\"Jewish camp\\" at the SS training area HL-Heidelager from October 1942 to September 1943. =Post-war= Dƒôbica tire company (Firma Oponiarska Dƒôbica), dating back to 1937 After the war, in new, Communist Poland, Dƒôbica again became the seat of a county, but the town was moved from the Krak√≥w to the Rzesz√≥w Voivodeship. In 1946, executions of anti-communist activists took place there (Public execution in Dƒôbica (1946)). War destruction again stopped the town's development, but recovery this time was fast and based on pre-war factories. In 1975, after administrative reform, counties in Poland ceased to exist and were replaced by numerous and small Voivodeships. Dƒôbica again was moved - this time from Rzesz√≥w to the newly created Tarn√≥w Voivodeship. In the late 1970s, Dƒôbica gained importance as a centre of food and agricultural production. This was due to the creation of Kombinat Rolno-Spozywczy Igloopol, which, under an influential Communist dignitary Edward Brzostowski, developed very fast. Igloopol built a huge factory and a completely new district, with numerous condominiums, located on the northern side of the rail line. The company achieved its peak in the late 1980s. After the collapse of the Communist regime, the company was divided into several smaller firms, controlled by former Communist activists. Sports There are two major sports clubs in Dƒôbica. Klub Sportowy (Sports Club) Wis≈Çoka Dƒôbica, founded in 1908, is one of the oldest sports organizations in the country. Wis≈Çoka is famous for its wrestlers, who have won numerous medals in the Olympic Games, World and European Championships. Other fields in which Wis≈Çoka's athletes achieved significant achievements are: soccer, boxing, cycling and karate. The club was sponsored by Tire Company Dƒôbica and it had its heyday in the 1970s. Another team, Igloopol Dƒôbica, was founded in 1978 and is the brainchild of a prominent activist of Polish communist party, Edward Brzostowski. Igloopol enjoyed strong support from the local government. Brzostowski was for some time Minister of Agriculture and director of Polish Football Association, so his favorite team prospered in soccer as well as in boxing, achieving significant successes. Igloopol's best years, the late 1980s, are closely associated with the peak of its sponsor. Lately, both teams played in regional lower divisions, hoping to win promotion. Both clubs contest the Dƒôbica derby, one of the fiercest derbies in south-eastern Poland. Famous personalities connected with Dƒôbica Dƒôbica is the birthplace of 20th-century composer Krzysztof Penderecki.

Based on the Oliver Hazard Perry class design, Canberra was one of four Adelaide class ships constructed in the United States of America, and one of six to serve in the RAN. The frigate entered service in 1981. During her career, Canberra was assigned to escort the Royal Yacht Britannia during Queen Elizabeth II's visit in 1988, helped enforce the post-Gulf War United Nations' sanctions against Iraq during 1992 and 1993, was part of the Australian responses to the 1998 Indonesian riots and the 2000 Solomon Islands Civil War, and returned to the Persian Gulf in 2002 as part of the War in Afghanistan. In 2005, Canberra became the first ship of her class to be decommissioned. The frigate was marked for conversion into a dive wreck and artificial reef off Barwon Heads, Victoria, and was scuttled on 4 October 2009.

For anti- submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets are fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the Adelaides later carried the Mark 46 torpedoes. Up to six machine guns can be carried for close-in defence, and since 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts have been installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments.Scott, Enhanced small-calibre systems offer shipborne stopping power The sensor suite includes an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and an AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters can be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel. Canberra was laid down as the first ship of the Perry class's Flight II design by Todd Pacific Shipyards at Seattle, Washington on 1 March 1978, and launched on 1 December 1978. Canberra was commissioned into the RAN on 21 March 1981.No Name (FFG 18), United States Navy The ship received the United States Navy hull number FFG-18 during construction. =Armament= Canberras main weapon was the Mark 13 missile launcher located on the foredeck: this is used to fire both Harpoon and SM-2MR Standard missiles.HMAS Canberra (II), Royal Australian Navy A Mark 75 OTO Melara gun is located on top of the superstructure, in front of the exhaust funnel.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, opp. p. 224 A triple- barrelled Mark 32 torpedo tube set is fitted to each side of the superstructure.

The Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway was a narrow-gauge line of the Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad in the state of Pennsylvania that operated between 1889 and 1916. The Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad earlier had established a station and picnic ground at Mount Gretna.  History  The Gilded Age iron industrialist and railroad president Robert Habersham Coleman decided that a 4-mile (7-kilometer) narrow-gauge railroad to the top of nearby Governor Dick Mountain would provide an additional tourist draw, and a 0.6-mile (1 kilometer) spur at milepost 0.75 could service the Pennsylvania National Guard rifle ranges nearby.Crittenden The line was built to the rare (in North America) and very narrow gauge of .

Locomotive #12 was ordered on 22 June 1889 and built in only 8 days to be ready for anticipated Independence Day crowds after the Porter Forney wheelbase proved too rigid for reliable service on small-radius curves. The Baldwin locomotives featured lagged smokeboxes and were the only gauge s ever operated in North America; although Baldwin built a gauge for the Ferrocarril de Tacubaya of Mexico City in 1897.Moody 1959 p.211Best 1968 p.168 Map of the Mt Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway Rails weighing were spiked onto the face of ties long. A turntable, engine-house, water tank, runaround track, and storage tracks were near the junction with the Cornwall & Lebanon at Mount Gretna. Return loops were built near the rifle range and around Governor Dick peak. During the summer of 1889 passengers were carried in one conventional coach and 7 open-sided observation cars boarded from long foot-boards running along the length of either side of the car. Two more observation cars were added when locomotive #15 was purchased for the summer of 1890. At first the railroad was popular, but the tourist trade declined after the novelty had died down. The loop around Governor Dick was dismantled after the summer of 1896,Schaumburg 1981 p.54 but the railroad continued operation for the National Guard rifle range. A serious accident in 1915 killed off that traffic. One of the observation cars overturned on a sharp curve when a large number of guardsmen attempted to board simultaneously from one side of the car. There were some serious injuries, and the tiny railroad ceased operation in the summer of 1916, shortly after its parent company's purchase by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The narrow-gauge equipment was loaded aboard standard gauge cars on 14 September 1916.  Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad  The standard-gauge Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad continued operations as a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and later Penn Central Transportation Company until 1972. Hurricane Agnes caused flood damage, preventing operation of trains on the branch, and the damage was not repaired.

It is named for the town of Dorking, in Surrey in southern England.  History  The Dorking is among the oldest British chicken breeds. It has sometimes been suggested that it derives from five-toed chickens brought to Britain by the Romans in the first century AD, but it is not known whether the Romans brought poultry with them, nor if they found five-toed poultry when they arrived. The Roman writer Columella, active at that time, mentions five-toed hens as being the best breeding-stock: \\"they are reckoned the most generous which have five toes\\". The Dorking originated in the southern home counties in south-east England, and is named for the market town of Dorking, in Surrey, from where birds were sent to the markets of London. It was the principal meat breed supplied to the metropolis until it was displaced by the Sussex in the early part of the twentieth century; it also became popular as an exhibition bird. It was among the breeds shown at the first poultry show, at London Zoo in 1845. The Dorking was included in the first poultry standard, The Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry, edited by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier and published in 1865 by the original Poultry Club of Great Britain. In the late nineteenth century, separate breed societies formed for the various colour varieties; two of these merged to form the Dorking Club, and a Scottish Dorking Club also formed. By about the time of the Second World War, none of these remained active. Interest in the breed had decreased rapidly, and it drew close to extinction. The Dorking Club was restarted in 1970. Three colour varieties ‚Äì coloured, silver-grey and white ‚Äì were included in the first Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874; the red was added in 1995. Three bantam varieties ‚Äì coloured, silver-grey and rose-comb white ‚Äì were added in 1960.  Characteristics  The Dorking has a rectangular body with short, five-toed legs. As with all single comb poultry, the comb points may require protection in extremely cold weather. Dorkings are also well known for their versatility as a breed for both egg and meat production. It is one of the few breeds with red earlobes that produces a white-shelled egg. The skin colour beneath the feathers is white. The weight is for cocks, for cockerels and for hens. There are five recognised colour varieties: white, silver-grey, red, dark and cuckoo.  Use  The Dorking was traditionally raised for meat.

Development on the Amiga version ceased in 1997, but an entirely re-written version of Directory Opus is still being actively developed and sold for the Microsoft Windows operating system by GPSoftware. Directory Opus was originally developed by, and is still written by, Australian Jonathan Potter. Until 1994, it was published by well-known Amiga software company Inovatronics, when Potter joined with Greg Perry and the Australian-based GPSoftware to continue its development, and has since been published by GPSoftware. Features Directory Opus has evolved since its first release in 1990 as a basic two-panel file manager. The interface has evolved significantly due to feedback given by its users. Some of the features include: *Single or dual-panel exploring. *Folder tree (either shared or separate for dual-display). *Tabbed explorer panels. *Ability to maintain date created/modified timestamps for both files and folders. *Internal handling of ZIP, RAR, 7Zip and other archive formats (browse them like folders). *Internal FTP handling, including (for a small extra fee) advanced FTP and SSH (browse these like folders also). *Internal MTP handling for portable devices like phones and cameras. *Flat-file display, where you can flatten a folder tree and even hide the folders themselves. *Powerful file selection and renaming tools, with advanced regex. *User-definable toolbars, menus, filetypes and filetype groups. *Preview panel, with preview of thumbnails (including animated avi thumbnails). *File collections.

This urban legend has been circulating around the Internet since at least 1995. It is first attested in English as a 1989 broadcast by a U.S. domestic religion- based TV broadcaster, Trinity Broadcasting Network. Legend and basis The legend holds that a team of Russian engineers purportedly led by an individual named \\"Mr. Azakov\\" in an unnamed place in Siberia had drilled a hole that was deep before breaking through to a cavity. Intrigued by this unexpected discovery, they lowered an extremely heat-tolerant microphone, along with other sensory equipment, into the well. The temperature deep within was ‚Äîheat from a chamber of fire from which (purportedly) the tormented screams of the damned could be heard. However, the recording was later found to be looped together from various sound effects, sometimes identified as the soundtrack of the 1972 movie Baron Blood. The Soviet Union had, in fact, drilled a hole more than deep, the Kola Superdeep Borehole, located not in Siberia but on the Kola Peninsula, which shares borders with Norway and Finland. Upon reaching the depth of in 1989, some interesting geological anomalies were found, although they reported no supernatural encounters. Propagation The story was reported to first have been published by the Finnish newspaper Ammennusastia, a journal published by a group of Pentecostal Christians from Lev√§sjoki, a village in the municipality of Siikainen in Western Finland. Rich Buhler, who interviewed the editors, found that the story had been based on recollections of a letter printed in the feature section of a newspaper called Etel√§ Soumen (possibly the Etel√§-Suomen Sanomat). When contacting the letter's author, Buhler found that he had drawn from a story appearing in a Finnish Christian newsletter named Vaeltajat, which had printed the story in July 1989. The newsletter's editor claimed that its origin had been a newsletter called Jewels of Jericho, published by a group of Messianic Jews in California. Here, Buhler stopped tracing the origins any further. American tabloids soon ran the story, and sound files began appearing on various sites across the Internet. Sensationalistic retellings of the legend can be found on YouTube, usually featuring the aforementioned Baron Blood sound effects. =TBN involvement= The story eventually made its way to the American Christian Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), which broadcast it on the network, claiming it to be proof of the literal existence of Hell. √Öge Rendalen, a Norwegian teacher, heard the story on TBN while visiting the United States. Disgusted with what he perceived to be mass gullibility, Rendalen decided to augment the tale at TBN's expense.Interview with √Öge Rendalen by Rich Buhler Rendalen wrote to the network, originally claiming that he disbelieved the tale but, upon his return to Norway, supposedly read a factual account of the story. According to Rendalen, the story claimed not only that the cursed well was real, but that a bat-like apparition (a common pictorial representation of demons, such as in Michelangelo's The Torment of Saint Anthony or the more recent Bat Boy by Weekly World News) had risen out of it before blazing a trail across the Russian sky. To perpetuate his hoax, Rendalen deliberately mistranslated a trivial Norwegian article about a local building inspector into the story, and submitted both the original Norwegian article and the English \\"translation\\" to TBN. Rendalen also included his real name, phone number and address, as well as those of a pastor friend who knew about the hoax and had agreed to expose it to anyone who called seeking verification. However, TBN did nothing to verify Rendalen's claims, and aired the story as proof of the validity of the original story. Alternative versions Since its publicity, many alternative versions of the Well to Hell story have been published. In 1992, the U.S. tabloid Weekly World News published an alternative version of the story, which was set in Alaska where 13 miners were killed after Satan came roaring out of hell.

It came out in August 1998. Its symbol is a cracked egg. Among the themes of the set were chicken, dice rolling and multiplayer Magic games. History Unglued was originally conceived by then-lead Magic designer Joel Mick and fellow designer Bill Rose. Having helped in the creation of many of the expansion sets of the time, they began talking about cards which were cut from the expansion or were unplayable, based on the rules of the game. Thinking this through, they conceptualized an expansion where all the cards had no place in serious games. Unglued was not entirely a commercially successful expansion, but the unique basic land cards - the only cards from the set legal in tournaments - were and still are valuable. The set also developed a cult following among casual Magic fans, and two sequel sets have been released since, Unhinged which came out in 2004, and Unstable in 2017. Unglued secret message All 94 cards in the Unglued set each had a single word printed on the bottom of the card. Alone these single words made little or no sense but when combined in proper numerical order with other cards in the series spell out the following secret message: \\"Here are some cards that didn't make it to print: Socks of Garfield, Hot Monkey Love, Colonel's Secret Recipe, Squee's Play, Banned in France, Spoon, Disrobing Scepter, Butt Wolf, Lotus Roach, Sesame Efreet, Needless Reminder Text, Chicken Choker, Clockwork Doppelganger, Henway, HELP I'M TRAPPED IN CARTA MUNDI, Mad Cow, Poke, Lord of Wombats, Gratuitous Babe Art, Brothers' War Bonds, Dwarven Kickboxer, Mickey's Drunk, Pact with the Wastes, CoP:BO, Urza's Chia Pet, Thallid Shooter, Shoelace, When Chihuahuas Attack, Wall of Cookies, Kobold Ninja, Mucusaur, Kjeldoran Outhouse, Bear in the Woods, Dental Thrull, Flavatog, Cereal Killer.\\" Flavor Text The flavor texts of the cards Double Dip, Double Play, Double Deal, Double Take, and Double Cross form the following limerick: In a duel and taking a lickin'... The wizard exclaimed, \\"I'm no chicken....\\" \\"I'm facing defeat,...\\" \\"But the next time we meet,...\\" \\"You're in for a nasty butt kickin'.\\" Which fit the mechanics of the cards, as all five not only did something for the player when played, but also created a benefit for the player during their next game against the same opponent.

The special master should not be confused with the traditional common law concept of a master, a judge of the High Court entrusted to deal with summary and administrative matters falling short of a full trial. In the federal judiciary of the United States, a special master is an adjunct to a federal court. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a federal court to appoint a special master, with the consent of the parties, to conduct proceedings and report to the Court. Role The role of the special master, who is frequently but not necessarily an attorney, is to supervise those falling under the order of the court to ensure that the court order is being followed and to report on the activities of the entity being supervised in a timely matter to the judge or the judge's designated representatives. Special masters have been controversial in some cases, and are cited by critics as an example of judicial overreach. For example, special masters have at times ordered the expenditure of funds over and above the amount appropriated by a legislative body for the remediation of the situation being examined. Their powers have generally been found to be valid and their remedies upheld by US courts. The US Supreme Court will normally assign original jurisdiction disputes (cases such as disputes between states that are first heard at the Supreme Court level) to a special master to conduct what amounts to a trial: the taking of evidence and a ruling. The Supreme Court can then assess the master's ruling much as a normal appeals court would, rather than conduct the trial itself. That is necessary as trials in the US almost always involve live testimony, and it would be too unwieldy for nine justices to rule on evidentiary objections in real time. In United States federal courts, special masters are appointed under Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 53 allows for a special master to be appointed only if one of the following exists: (1) the parties consent to the appointment, (2) to hold a trial without a jury or make recommended findings of fact where there is some exceptional condition or accounting or difficult computation of damages, or (3) address pre-trial or post-trial matters that cannot be effectively and timely addressed by a judge or magistrate judge. Examples Special masters were appointed by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Whitfield Davidson to investigate allegations of voter fraud on behalf of the 1948 Democratic Party primary campaign for Lyndon B. Johnson to the U.S. Senate. According to Robert A. Caro, the masters would have found that Johnson's 86-vote victory was delivered by hundreds of fraudulent ballots, but the investigation was halted by the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that the Democratic Party, not the federal government, had the responsibility over primary elections. The usage of special masters in matters involving complex electronic discovery (or \\"eDiscovery\\") has been promulgated by the Academy of Court Appointed Masters (ACAM). The United States Court of Federal Claims operates an Office of Special Masters to resolve claims under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which is informally known as the vaccine court. Cases involving special masters often involve situations in which it has been shown that governmental entities are violating civil rights. High-profile cases in recent years in which special masters have been used include some in which states have been ordered to upgrade their prison facilities, which were held to violate the US Constitution, which bars cruel and unusual punishment and certain state mental hospitals, which have been found so substandard as to violate the rights of their inmates. Summaries of cases involving special masters are published at Cohen's Special Master Case Reporter. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, then‚ÄìAttorney General John Ashcroft appointed Kenneth Feinberg as special master to oversee the dispensation of an $11 billion victims' compensation fund.

(PDVSA, ) (English: Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on 1 January 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil exporter. Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. Following the Bolivarian Revolution, PDVSA was mainly used as a political tool of the government. Profits were also used to assist the presidency, with funds directed towards allies of the Venezuelan government. With PDVSA focusing on political projects instead of oil production, mechanical and technical statuses deteriorated while employee expertise was removed following thousands of politically-motivated firings. Incompetence within the company has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents as well as endemic corruption. As a result, thousands of workers have abandoned their work for PDVSA, especially after PDVSA was put under military control. Reserves and capacity PDVSA Gas, Isla de Margarita Venezuela has of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated of tar- like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has of natural gas reserves. The crude oil PDVSA extracts from the Orinoco is refined into a fuel eponymously named ‚ÄòOrimulsion‚Äô. PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of per day (600,000 m¬≥). Officials say production is around although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela's output at least lower. The organization's payroll tripled during the presidency of Hugo Chavez. Oil production fell steeply, a drop of 700,000 barrels per day. Soaring oil prices began in 2002 and peaked in 2008 at $147 per barrel. Politicization In 2002, many of the employees of PDVSA went on strike against the policies of Ch√°vez, who in response fired over 19,000 workers from the company. Intevep, the research and development arm of PDVSA, reportedly lost 80% of its workers, severely damaging PDVSA's ability to innovate and compete in the global petroleum market.\\"Brain Haemorrhage; Venezuela's Oil Diaspora.\\" The Economist, 19 July 2014, p. 31(US). World History in Context. Accessed 11 Oct. 2018. PDVSA saw stagnant growth in the following era which was defined by a boom in oil prices. Between 2002 and 2012, incapacitating injuries to employees rose from 1.8 per million man hours to 6.2 (extremely high compared to 0.6 per million man hours for Pemex in 2012), highlighting the company's struggle to optimize. Many ex-PDVSA employees moved to Alberta, where the oil consistency is similar to that of the Orinoco. As a result, the number of Venezuelans in Alberta has risen from 465 in 2001 to 3,860 in 2011. Many PDVSA workers migrated to Colombia and joined Ecopetrol, and are credited with helping the company attain huge profits throughout the 2010s. In 2006, Rafael Ram√≠rez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Ch√°vez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: \\"PDVSA is red [the color identified with Ch√°vez's political party], red from top to bottom\\". Ch√°vez defended Ram√≠rez, saying that public workers should back the \\"revolution\\". He added that \\"PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami\\".Storm over Venezuela oil speech, BBC News,4 November 2006. Accessed online 7 November 2006. PDVSA continues to hire only supporters of the president, and PDVSA revenue is used to fund political projects. History =1970s: nationalization= Under the presidency of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez, whose economic plan, \\"La Gran Venezuela\\", called for the nationalization of the oil industry, Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande). This was the birth of Petr√≥leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies, such as Lagoven (Standard Oil), Maraven (Shell), and Llavonen (Mobil). Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new 'national' oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC) predecessor.Vegard Bye, \\"Nationalization of Oil in Venezuela: Re-defined Dependence and Legitimization of Imperialism\\", Journal of Peace Research, 16, no. 1 (1979): 67, accessed December 3, 2014. With the 1976 nationalization, each previous multinational operator was converted into an affiliate of PDVSA; these affiliates were grouped into an administrative structure underneath both PDVSA and the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy. To prevent political uprising from within PDVSA, direct anti- organization clauses were written into the law creating the company. With this absorption, PDVSA became the employer of engineers with comprehensive technical training from the old multinational corporations‚ÄúPDVSA.\\" The National of Venezuela , 3 Feb. 2017. General OneFile. Accessed Oct 25, 2018.\\" and promptly took advantage of their newfound expertise. Within 25 years of nationalization, PDVSA would become the largest company in Latin America and the tenth most profitable in the world. In that 25-year span they went from 18 billion barrels to over 80 billion barrels worth of oil reserves, with a similar increase in production capacity. =1980s‚Äì1990s: Apertura= PDVSA's poor post-nationalization performance resulted in Venezuela's opening of the company to global cooperation. The opening up of the Venezuelan oil industry, or Apertura, was initialized with a Venezuelan Supreme Court decision which removed older laws prohibiting cooperation with multi-national corporations Venezuelan land. From 1993 through 1998, PDVSA split extraction rights with multiple multi-national companies in special arrangements called ‚Äústrategic associations‚Äù, in effect trading Venezuelan crude oil for the efficiency that came from outside expertise and technology. These ‚Äústrategic associations‚Äù were controversial; Venezuela was able to maximize profits at the cost of lenient taxation on the multinational companies and the loss of sovereign control over domestic resources. With Ch√°vez's election, Venezuela's attention became increasingly focused on complying with OPEC. As oil prices collapsed in the late 1990s, however, keeping the special arrangements while conforming to OPEC regulations became impossible, leading to an end of the Apertura arrangements for Venezuela. Before the election of Ch√°vez, PDVSA ran autonomously, making oil decisions based on internal guidance to increase profits.Wiseman, Colin and Daniel B√©land. ‚ÄúThe Politics of Institutional Change in Venezuela: Oil Policy During the Presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez.‚Äù Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Vol 35, No. 70 (2010), pp. 141-164. JSTOR. Accessed 3 Nov. 2018. Ch√°vez, once he came to power, unlocked PDVSA and effectively turned it into a direct government arm whose profits would be injected into social spending. The result of this was the creation of ‚ÄúBolivarian Missions‚Äù, oil funded social programs targeting poverty, literacy, hunger, and more. With the Apertura, PDVSA became the de facto economic legislator of Venezuela, with many of its managers becoming active in Venezuelan politics and serving as national representatives in economic summits. Ch√°vez continued this trend, further incorporating PDVSA into the government's structure, but made social welfare the priority. During his campaign, Ch√°vez repeatedly remarked that PDVSA was previously too powerful and autonomous, and its managers acted subversively to Venezuela. Ch√°vez turned the post-Apertura PDVSA into a political rallying point for his mostly lower-class supporters by associating its Apertura neo-liberal policies with the countries elites, energizing his working class supporters against the companies former special arrangements. In 1998 PDVSA produced 3.4 million barrels of oil a day and had 40,000 employees. By law it deposited its revenues in the sovereign fund accounts in Venezuela's Central Bank. =2000s: recovery and social spending= Filling station in Venezuela of PDV (a subsidiary of PDVSA) In December 2002 the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA's managers and employees (including the CTV trade union federation) lock out workers to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for two months. Nearly 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed, and production resumed with employees loyal to the elected government. The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch \\"an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture\\", surrounding this strike. The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential \\"coup\\" by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country's \\"socialist revolution\\".German Zambrano, head of communications, cited in In 2005 PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58. In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas. In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the US, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price. Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast including New York's Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon. On 28 July 2006, credit ratings agency Moody's Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company does not provide adequate operational and financial information. PDVSA has still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005. During the 2000s, PDVSA has made contributions to the protection of the environment through showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal. In 2008, PDVSA had been Latin America's largest company, but in the next year was overtaken by Petrobras and Pemex, according to a ranking of the region's top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.Largest companies in Latin Am√©rica 2007 expropriations Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control, Total, Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retained minority shares in their Venezuelan projects. Reaching a settlement with ExxonMobil has proven difficult; Venezuela offered book value for ExxonMobil's assets and ExxonMobil asked for as much as $12 billion. This matter and others including the claims of ConocoPhillips remain before the World Bank‚Äôs International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. PDVSA paid compensation for assets it nationalized, including $255 million paid to ExxonMobil on February 15, 2012 in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil's Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to U.S. firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc. for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009. Also in 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008). =2010s: crisis in Venezuela= In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport's National Petroleum Ltd. In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80-100 million cubic meters of gas. In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture. In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil. Following the death of Ch√°vez in 2013, policies he enacted caused a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, with the nation's economy deteriorating greatly. Because of the ongoing hyperinflation and food shortage, paychecks have become all but valueless, leading to mass resignation from workers.Cunningham, Nick. ‚ÄúCorruption at Venezuela‚Äôs State-Run Oil Company Is Pushing the Country Deeper into a Crisis.‚Äù Business Insider, 19 April 2018. Accessed 3 Nov. 2018. By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international waters, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue. In addition, Nicol√°s Maduro fired the head of PDVSA and replaced him with Major General Manuel Quevedo, placating the military by giving them control of PDVSA. These recent developments have resulted in a fragmented corporate structure and not enough workers to keep certain rigs operating continuously. By the end of 2013, Venezuela produced 1.2 million barrels of oil per day from the Orinoco, falling short of its target of 1.5 million barrels. The repeated poor performances of PDVSA are heavily linked to Venezuela's current hyperinflation crisis. In order to correct for these shortcomings, Maduro has installed more Venezuelan military members in several key PDVSA positions, in an effort to reduce the corruption and inefficiency.‚ÄúVenezuela Shakes Up PDVSA Management As Oil Production Tanks.‚Äù E&P;, 18 October 2018. Accessed 3 Nov. 2018. Between 1999 and 2017 PDVSA earned an estimated $635 billion in revenue and produced an additional $406 billion worth of oil. Production dropped further, to half of its 1998 benchmark. Accountability for the funds was no longer required and Jorge Giordani, minister of planning until in 2014, estimates that $300 billion was simply stolen. Despite having some of the largest proven oil reserves in the world, in June 2018 PDVSA's actions grew more desperate as they began to import and refine foreign crude oil for the first time in the country's history so they could meet export demands. Oil production had also slowed to levels not seen since the 1950s due to economic and management difficulties. Since 2015, a US Justice Department investigation into PDVSA corruption has resulted in 12 guilty pleas pertaining to a bribery scheme between PDVSA and its contractors; This scheme involved members within the company would insure favorable treatment of vendors in exchange for kickbacks.‚ÄúVenezuela Pleads Guilty in US to Role in PDVSA Bribe Scheme.‚Äù VOA News, 16 July 2018. Accessed 3 Nov. 2018 These actions violate the US's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and are classified as conspiracy to commit money laundering. In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PdVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela. In August 2017, Donald Trump's administration imposed economic sanctions against PDVSA. With the prospects of Maduro leaving power in early 2019, which could bring both stability and a more trustworthy government other nations will loan to, confidence saw an assessable increase in the nation, with tangible financial benefits like an increase in value of bonds for PDVSA, the country's major oil and gas company (which is state-owned but backs Guaid√≥), which went up 5% in January 2019. Investors have said that the bonds would double in value when Maduro leaves office.  Ownership of Citgo  PDVSA bought 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation in 1986 and the remaining half in 1990.Company History , by Citgo, accessed on 10 December 2007. With full ownership of Citgo, PDVSA at its peak controlled 10% of the US domestic oil market, creating a lucrative export chain from Venezuelan soil to American consumers, as the two largest buyers of Venezuelan petroleum are the United States and China, respectively. PDVSA was, despite dwindling performance, able to add Russia's Rosneft as an extraction partner in 2013, with the anticipation of extracting 2.1 million barrels of petroleum per day. With the onset of the Venezuelan Crisis, Venezuela borrowed 1.5 billion dollars from Russia, offering 49.9% of PDVSA's share in Citgo as collateral; Venezuela's high likelihood of default means Citgo could be absorbed by Rosneft in the near future.Valencia, Robert. ‚ÄúDon't Worry About War with North Korea - Venezuela Is the Real Problem.‚Äù Yahoo! News, 14 October 2018. Accessed 3 Nov. 2018. On October 30, 2018 PDVSA paid $949 million on its Citgo backed bond to investors, a payment many analysts thought was impossible for the company given its recent liquidity struggles.Scigliuzzo, Davide. ‚ÄúPDVSA Bewilders Bond Analysts by Making $949 Million Payments.‚Äù Bloomberg, 30 Oct. 2018. Accessed 3 Nov. 2018. This payment means that PDVSA will continue to own Citgo for the time being, but failure to pay in the future will result in Citgo transferring ownership to one of PDVSA's creditors. Losing Citgo would be disastrous for PDVSA, as they would lose the key terminal of their export chain to the US and the chemical additives necessary for oil refinery that Citgo produces; this loss would wreak additional havoc on Venezuela's economy, drying up the revenue stream that provides 90% of the government's hard-currency earnings.Whelan, Jeanne and Anthony Faiola. ‚ÄúVenezuela‚Äôs Foreign Creditors Try to Lay Claim to Citgo.‚Äù The Washington Post, 17 October 2018.

Crystallex, through a US court case, has already received an undisclosed amount of Citgo shares in compensation for Venezuela's 2008 nationalization of their mines. A separate Canadian mining firm, Rusoro, is also pursuing $1.28 billion in repayment for the prior nationalization of its assets, which it is pursuing through the US justice system until PDVSA begins making payments.

It was created in 2000 by Portland, Oregon USA artist Paul Guinan. Originally intended for comics, the character became known via a faux-historical website created by Guinan, and has since appeared in other media.  Development  Boilerplate was originally featured on a website created by Paul Guinan in 2000. The Boilerplate site details the history of a remarkable robot built in the late 19th century, and features photoshopped \\"archival images\\" in which Boilerplate (actually a 12-inch articulated model) is seen interacting with historical figures, such as Teddy Roosevelt and Pancho Villa. Becoming aware that some visitors to the site were taken in by its contents, making it an unintentional hoax, Guinan resolved to see how authentic he could make the character seem, working to ensure the descriptions of non-fictional events were accurate. He explained his motivation in a 2002 interview > \\"Certainly I felt happy about having achieved my goal,\\" he said. \\"I put this > thing across as trying to be real, and people bought into it. So, that's a > success! But, as an amateur historian, I feel a responsibility to get the > story right. So I felt bad about some of these people being hoaxed. It was a > mixed bag.\\" Guinan and Bennett at WonderCon 2010 > \\"But,\\" he revealed, \\"I thought, if I was getting this reaction and I wasn't > really trying, then what would happen if I really tried?\\" Guinan estimated that roughly a third of the site's visitors treated its faux history as real. Comedian Chris Elliott, while realising that Boilerplate was fictional, thought that the spoof dated back to the 19th century and included the character in one of his books (see below). Guinan later expanded his website into The History of Robots in the Victorian Era, which features other \\"turn-of-the-century robots, both real and imagined\\".  Fictional character history  Boilerplate is built by Professor Archibald Campion in the 1880s and unveiled at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The robot's notable adventures include an expedition to the Antarctic, during which it saves the lives of the team members by singlehandedly moving ice floes, clearing a path for the ship to sail out. Designed for the self-proclaimed purpose of \\"preventing the deaths of men in the conflicts of nations,\\" Boilerplate charges into combat during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Boxer Rebellion. Campion and his robot also circle the planet with the U.S. Navy, make silent movies, and hobnob with the likes of Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla.https://www.amazon.com/dp/0810989506 Boilerplate is also active in the First World War, but disappears during the relief of Major Whittlesey's Lost Battalion, possibly having been captured by the Germans for study. Supporters of this theory point out that German military technology advances tremendously in the twenty years between the two world wars, encompassing guided rockets, experimental jets, and sophisticated tanks. Post World War II, Boilerplate is sighted on a number of occasions, often in Chicago.  In other media  * Paul Guinan and his wife Anina Bennett (who also maintains the Boilerplate website) have coauthored Boilerplate: History's Mechanical Marvel, an illustrated history of the character's adventures. This coffee table book covers Boilerplate's 25-year existence as well as its subsequent impact on popular culture. It was published by Abrams Image in October 2009. Guinan and Bennett have previously collaborated on the comic book Heartbreakers, published by IDW Publishing; \\"Heartbreakers Meet Boilerplate\\", a 2005 one-shot of this series, also featured Boilerplate and was nominated for an Eisner Award. * Boilerplate is a character in Chris Elliott's 2005 novel The Shroud of the Thwacker, a spoof historical thriller. Elliott mistakenly thought that the Boilerplate site concerned a hoax which dated back to the 19th century and included material from the website in his book, not realising it wasn't in the public domain. After being alerted to the copyright infringement, Elliott and Guinan negotiated a settlement which allowed the character to be used in exchange for a percentage of Elliott's earnings from the book and credit in future editions. * Boilerplate is featured on the cover of Canadian indie pop band Stars's 2008 EP Sad Robots, as well as on merchandise for their 2008‚Äì9 tour. *Paramount Pictures have optioned the film rights, to be produced by J.

History  =Early history= Texas Southmost College was established in 1926 under the name of The Junior College of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, as a subsidiary of the local school district in Brownsville. On September 21, 1926, 84 students began classes, meeting in the old Brownsville High School.Raymond, Jeff (September 1, 2006). \\"University partnership turns 15 today\\". McClatchy‚ÄìTribune Business News. p. 1. From 1928 to 1948, it was located in Brownsville High School and Brownsville Elementary School on Palm Boulevard between Washington Street and Jefferson Street. Despite hard times during the Great Depression, the college continued to maintain nominal levels of enrollment. The name of the college changed in 1931 to Brownsville Junior College then again to Texas Southmost College in 1950. During World War II due to wartime mobilization enrollment dwindled, with the number of graduates halved from 1943-1945. A major improvement came in 1948 when the city of Brownsville acquired the lands formerly comprising the decommissioned army base known as Fort Brown, which had been closed in 1946. By 1948, when the college had an enrollment of around 1,250 students, their own campus, and a generous budget, talks had started within the school district about creating a separate district for the college. It was decided that the new district would cover southern Cameron County. In 1950, on the silver anniversary of the college, the Brownsville Independent School District handed over the deed to the college over to the newly formed Southmost Union Junior College District. = 1950s to 1990s = The Texas Southmost College athletics program flourished in the 1950s: the school had football, basketball, boxing and track teams and many of these teams won accolades for their performance. In the mid- to late 1960s, the TSC athletic program experienced a great decline and many competitive programs did not survive into the 1970s. In the 1960s, despite the declining competitive situation of the sports programs, the college gained the Rancho Del Cielo research center, located 300 miles south of Brownsville, in Mexico. This few acre research center has abundant plant life and rain forest climatic conditions. In 1973 Texas Southmost College began offering its first bachelor's degree programs and graduate courses in cooperation with Pan American University (later known as University of Texas-Pan American and located in Edinburg, Texas). This was the origin of the entity known as Pan American University at Brownsville, which worked independently from Texas Southmost College. In the late 1980s, Pan American University created a partnership with the University of Texas System and the entity in Brownsville became known as The University of Texas-Pan American at Brownsville. Texas Southmost College and The University of Texas-Pan American at Brownsville combined their educational functions as The University of Texas at Brownsville on September 1, 1991. This created the University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. After 1991, UTB/TSC continued to grow, eventually boasting over 10,000 students. On November 2, 2004, voters in the Texas Southmost College district voted yes to a $68-million bond package so the college could do a number of building projects. = End of educational partnership with the University of Texas at Brownsville = On November 10, 2010, the University of Texas System Board of Regents voted to end the University of Texas at Brownsville's educational partnership with Texas Southmost College as it stood.http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/tsc-119207-board-texas.html On February 17, 2011, the TSC Board of Trustees voted 4-3 to separate from UTB.http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/trustees-122947-college-night.html On August 31, 2015, UTB was officially dissolved and UTPA's name was changed to The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. =Presidents= Presidents of Texas Southmost College *Jesus R.

It aired on SBS from 3 December 2003 to 5 February 2004 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. The title of the show comes from the Led Zeppelin song of the same name, which is frequently used in the underscore. The drama is the second entry in director Lee Jang-soo's Heaven Trilogy which included Beautiful Days in 2001 and Tree of Heaven in 2006. The drama was a hit and received an average viewership rating of 38.8%, and 45.3% for the finale. Synopsis Han Jung-suh (Choi Ji-woo) and Cha Song-joo (Kwon Sang-woo) are childhood friends and have a special bond that blossoms into love. They both share the pain of losing a loved one: Song-joo's father died in a traffic accident and Jung- suh's mother died of eye cancer. Jung-suh's father (Ha Jae-young) marries an actress named Tae Mi-ra (Lee Hui-hyang), who brings her real daughter, Han Yoo-ri (Kim Tae-hee), and son, Han Tae-hwa (Lee Wan) into the household. Yoo- ri is jealous of Jung-suh, making her look terrible in front of her mother, who begins to turn on Jung-suh. When Jung-suh's father leaves for work, her stepmother assaults her. She thwarts Jung-suh's attempts to study abroad with Song-joo, who then leaves for America alone. Mi-ra plots for Yoo-ri to win the affections of Song-joo who is the heir of his family fortune. All the while, Jung-suh tries to be nice to Tae-hwa, but he mistakes her friendship for something more, and falls in love with her. Three years later, Song-joo (Kwon Sang-woo) comes back from America, and Jung-suh (Choi Ji-woo) rushes to greet him. A jealous Yoo-ri (Kim Tae-hee) tries to stop them from reuniting. As they race to the airport, Yoo-ri intentionally hits Jung-suh with her car. Jung-suh is taken to the hospital where a group of people had just died in fire. Yoo-ri swaps Jung-suh's ID with one of the people to fake her death. She takes the real Jung-suh to her biological father's home. Tae-hwa (Shin Hyun-joon), still in love with Jung-suh, finds out what Yoo-ri has done, but seizes the opportunity to run away with Jung-suh. Jung-suh loses her memory, and Tae-hwa moves them away and changes their names. Five years later, Yoo-ri is soon to be engaged to Song-joo. Song-joo decides that he needs to let go of Jung-suh and goes to the carousel they used to ride as children. He wishes to see Jung- suh just once more, looks up, and sees her on the carousel. Jung-suh, now named Kim Ji-soo, works at a small clothing shop while living with Tae-hwa (now Chul-soo). Song-joo rushes to Ji-soo and tells her that she is Jung-suh, but she doesn't believe him. Song-joo is determined to make her remember her past, and through a series of events, he and Jung-suh become close. Jung-suh regains her memory when Yoo-ri nearly hits her with her car again and rushes to tell Song-joo. She forgives Tae-hwa as she knew he did it out of love. Jung-suh and Song-joo are happy together, until she discovers she has eye cancer. She asks Tae-hwa to take her away from Song-joo, since she can't bear to see him in pain. Gradually, Jung-suh's vision deteriorates into blindness. Tae-hwa tells Song-joo and his family the truth starting from the accident. Yoo-ri is arrested, and her mother goes insane and is admitted to a mental hospital. Song-joo marries Jung-suh, who is now blind, with the blessing of his mother and her father. Jung-suh tells Tae-hwa that her one wish is to see Song-joo's face one last time. Both Song-joo and Tae-hwa ask a doctor to let them give Jung-suh one of their corneas, but the doctor tells them that they can't take corneas from live donors. Tae-hwa wants to grant her wish at all costs and commits suicide via car crash in order to donate his cornea to her. After his death, Jung-suh has the operation and is able to see again. However, Song-joo finds out about Tae-hwa's death and later on tells Jung-suh. She starts to feel sick again, and the doctor states that the tumor has spread to her brain and is inoperable; the same incurable illness that killed her mother. Jung-suh, realizing this, forgives Tae Mi-ra and Yoo-ri because of Tae-hwa. Both Yoo-ri and Tae Mi-ra feel remorse for their wrongdoings against Jung-suh, and apologize to her. Jung-suh dies a few days later at the seaside near her childhood home, in the arms of Song-joo.

It aired as part of Fuji TV's \\"Saturday Hallyu Wide Hour\\" programming block. The first episode received a viewership rating of 6% to 8% and went on to receive ratings as high at 12%. It also aired on cable channel KNTV from 4 June to 29 October 2005. According to a poll conducted by TV Asahi variety show SMAP Station in May 2007, Stairway to Heaven ranked as the third most popular Korean drama in Japan. It aired in Vietnam on HTV9 from May 2 to June 27, 2004. It aired in the Philippines on GMA Network in 2005, during which it received a peak viewership rating of 41.5% and an average viewership rating of 36.1%, making it one of the highest rated programs of all time in the country. The series became a rerun after 10 years from 28 September to 27 November 2015 which transferred to morning from primetime on the same network. In 2005, broadcasting rights to the drama were sold to eight countries across Latin America including Mexico, Peru and Costa Rica. It aired in Thailand on Channel 3 in 2006. It was aired in Indonesia on Indosiar in 2004 and became one of the most popular Korean drama at the time.

Leofwine was the son of √Ülfwine, who is otherwise unknown, but the family appears to have originated in the East Midlands. Leofwine and his sons were considered by the See of Worcester as spoliators who seized church land, but East Midlands religious establishments regarded them as benefactors. Under √Üthelred, Leofwine's sphere of office was in the Hwicce areas of Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, but these counties were given to Danes by King Cnut soon after he gained the throne in 1016. However, Leofwine kept his rank and may have been appointed Ealdorman of Mercia in 1017 in succession to Eadric Streona, but Leofwine's eldest son Northman was murdered on Cnut's orders in the same year.

Kuhn as a simple model zero-sum two-player imperfect-information game, amenable to a complete game-theoretic analysis. In Kuhn poker, the deck includes only three playing cards, for example a King, Queen, and Jack. One card is dealt to each player, which may place bets similarly to a standard poker. If both players bet or both players pass, the player with the higher card wins, otherwise, the betting player wins.  Game description  In conventional poker terms, a game of Kuhn poker proceeds as follows: *Each player antes 1. *Each player is dealt one of the three cards, and the third is put aside unseen. *Player one can check or bet 1. **If player one checks then player two can check or bet 1. ***If player two checks there is a showdown for the pot of 2 (i.e. the higher card wins 1 from the other player). ***If player two bets then player one can fold or call. ****If player one folds then player two takes the pot of 3 (i.e. winning 1 from player 1). ****If player one calls there is a showdown for the pot of 4 (i.e. the higher card wins 2 from the other player). **If player one bets then player two can fold or call. ***If player two folds then player one takes the pot of 3 (i.e. winning 1 from player 2). ***If player two calls there is a showdown for the pot of 4 (i.e. the higher card wins 2 from the other player).  Optimal strategy  The game has a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium; when both players play equilibrium strategies, the first player should expect to lose at a rate of ‚àí1/18 per hand (as the game is zero-sum, the second player should expect to win at a rate of +1/18). There is no pure-strategy equilibrium. Kuhn demonstrated there are infinitely many equilibrium strategies for the first player, forming a continuum governed by a single parameter. In one possible formulation, player one freely chooses the probability alpha isin [0, 1/3] with which he will bet when having a Jack (otherwise he checks; if the other player bets, he should always fold). When having a King, he should bet with the probability of 3alpha (otherwise he checks; if the other player bets, he should always call). He should always check when having a Queen, and if the other player bets after this check, he should call with the probability of alpha + 1/3. The second player has a single equilibrium strategy: Always betting or calling when having a King; when having a Queen, checking if possible, otherwise calling with the probability of 1/3; when having a Jack, never calling and betting with the probability of 1/3. dominated strategies. Generalized versions In addition to the basic version invented by Kuhn, other versions appeared adding bigger deck, more players, betting rounds, etc., increasing the complexity of the game. = 3-player Kuhn Poker = A variant for three players was introduced in 2010 by Nick Abou Risk and Duane Szafron. In this version, the deck includes four cards (adding a ten card), from which three are dealt to the players; otherwise, the basic structure is the same: while there is no outstanding bet, a player can check or bet, with an outstanding bet, a player can call or fold. If all players checked or at least one player called, the game proceeds to showdown, otherwise, the betting player wins. A family of Nash equilibria for 3-player Kuhn poker is known analytically, which makes it the largest game with more than two players with analytic solution. The family is parameterized using 4‚Äì6 parameters (depending on the chosen equilibrium). In all equilibria, player 1 has a fixed strategy, and he always checks as the first action; player 2's utility is constant, equal to ‚Äì1/48 per hand. The discovered equilibrium profiles show an interesting feature: by adjusting a strategy parameter beta (between 0 and 1), player 2 can freely shift utility between the other two players while still remaining in equilibrium; player 1's utility is equal to -frac{1+2beta}{48} (which is always worse than player 2's utility), player 3's utility is frac{1+beta}{24}. It is not known if this equilibrium family covers all Nash equilibria for the game.

In some older texts the name is spelled \\"Pinus tabulaeformis\\". Description Pinus tabuliformis is a medium-sized evergreen tree 20‚Äì30 m tall, with a flat-topped crown when mature (whence the scientific name, 'table-shaped'). The growth rate is fast when young, but slows with age. The grey-brown bark fissures at an early age compared to other trees. The broadly spreading shape is very pronounced, in part due to the long horizontal branching pattern. The needle-like leaves are shiny grey-green, 10‚Äì17 cm long and 1.5 mm broad, usually in pairs but occasionally in threes at the tips of strong shoots on young trees. The cones are green, ripening brown about 20 months after pollination, broad ovoid, 4‚Äì6 cm long, with broad scales, each scale with a small prickle. The seeds are 6‚Äì7 mm long with a 15‚Äì20 mm wing, and are wind-dispersed. ;Varieties There are two varieties: *Pinus tabuliformis var. tabuliformis. China, except for Liaoning. Broadest cone scales under 15 mm broad. *Pinus tabuliformis var. mukdensis. Liaoning, North Korea. Broadest cone scales over 15 mm broad. Some botanists also treat the closely related Henry's pine (Pinus henryi) and Sikang pine (Pinus densata) as varieties of Chinese red pine; in some older texts even the very distinct Yunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis) is included as a variety. Uses and cultivation The wood is used for general construction. The pulpwood produces certain resins that are used as artificial vanilla flavouring (vanillin). The resin is also used to make turpentine and related products, and is used medicinally to treat a variety respiratory and internal ailments, such as kidney and bladder upsets, wounds, and sores. The bark is a source of tannin. Medicinal use of the pine needles also takes place, which also contain a natural insecticide, as well as a source for a dye. The needles are used to brew pine needle tea (sollip-cha). It is uncommon in cultivation outside of China, grown only in botanical gardens.

Writing Together with Steven Simon, Benjamin wrote The Age of Sacred Terror (Random House, 2002), which documents the rise of al Qaeda and religiously motivated terrorism, as well as America's efforts to combat that threat. They review the history of Islamist political thought from ibn Taymiyya in the 13th century, to al-Wahhab (the 18th century founder of Wahabbism) down to bin Laden. The danger, as they see it, is that \\"al Qaeda's belief system cannot be separated neatly from Islamic teachings, because it has -- selectively and perniciously -- built on fundamental Islamic ideas and principles.\\" The second half of the book outlines the West's response. Ellen Laipson, in her review of the book, praises the authors for their study and methodology. Benjamin and Simon would follow up The Age of Sacred Terror in 2005 with The Next Attack: The Globalization of Jihad (Hodder & Soughton (in Britain), 2005), a book which received high-praise from Bill Clinton.

It runs from the junction with U.S. Route 45 (US 45) in West Kankakee north to US 41 in Skokie. In Chicago and the suburbs it's known as Cicero Avenue. Before this, Cicero Avenue was previously known as 48th Avenue, owing to its City of Chicago address of 4800 West. Route description IL 50 begins in Kankakee at an intersection with Southeast Avenue (US 45/US 52) and heads north as Schuyler Avenue. The four-lane road crosses the Kankakee River and then turns east onto East River Street before turning north onto a one-way pair of Harrison Avenue northbound and Indiana Avenue southbound. While on this one-way pair, IL 50 crosses two railroads, then turns east onto Fair Street and crosses a third. After crossing the railroads, the roadway curves in a northerly direction and becomes Hobbie Avenue before it enters Bradley. In Bradley, the road is known as Kinzie Avenue, and it continues due north, meeting a diamond interchange with Interstate 57 (I-57), then leaving the city. North of the city, IL 50 begins to parallel a railroad. It bends to the northeast, crosses the southern branch of Rock Creek, and passes through Manteno. Northeast of Manteno, the highway leaves Kankakee County and crosses into Will County. Still paralleling the railroad and I-57, IL 50 passes through Peotone and heads toward Monee. In Monee, the route dips to the north and crosses the railroad, then crosses into University Park. Here the route is known as Governors Highway. It curves north before leaving the city and Will County, crossing into urban Cook County. Upon crossing into Cook County, IL 50 enters Richton Park. From here northward the road is known as Cicero Avenue. It passes straight through Richton Park and into Matteson. In Matteson, IL 50 meets Lincoln Highway (US 30). The route then continues due north through the remainder of Matteson, through the Southern Green Belt Forest Preserve, and into Country Club Hills. Continuing north through Country Club Hills, IL 50 crosses under I-80, then under I-57, without access to either highway. Just north of I-57, IL 50 curves slightly to the northwest, leaves Country Club Hills and enters Oak Forest. The route continues northward in Oak Forest, intersecting 159th Street (US 6). North of the US 6 intersection, the highway crosses into Midlothian, where it intersects IL 83 south at 149th Street. Pink Line, with a train approaching IL 50 and IL 83 head north and enter Crestwood. In the northern part of this city, IL 83 splits off to the northwest at an intersection with Cal Sag Road, while IL 50 continues heading north and crosses the Little Calumet River into Alsip. Here, the highway shares an interchange with I-294 (Tri-State Tollway), then continues due north into Oak Lawn. In Oak Lawn, IL 50 meets US 12 and US 20 at 95th Street, then continues north and leaves the city. Around 79th street, It begins to parallel Illinois Route 171 and Illinois Route 43 to the west. It parallels Illinois 171 until its terminus at Illinois Route 72 and Illinois Route 43 for the duration of the route. Continuing north, the highway enters Chicago entirely and serves Chicago Midway International Airport, then meets I-55 (Stevenson Expressway) at a diamond interchange. North of the interchange with I-55, IL 50 crosses the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal, leaving Chicago and entering Cicero. The route re-enters Chicago a short distance later, meeting I-290 (Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway) just north of the boundary. Heading north through the western portion of the city, the highway intersects IL 64 and IL 19 before crossing under I-90 (Kennedy Expressway) without access. Continuing north, IL 50 meets I-94 (Edens Expressway) at an interchange in which IL 50 has no access to I-94, and only traffic travelling eastbound on I-94 can access IL 50 southbound. The route then crosses the north branch of the Chicago River and intersects US 14 at Peterson Avenue. North of this intersection, the highway leaves Chicago and passes through Lincolnwood. It then continues north to its northern terminus at Lincoln Avenue (US 41) in Skokie.

While various models were tested, only two versions of the ERC entered production in large numbers: the ERC-90 Lynx and the ERC-90 Sagaie. The main difference between the two versions is the type of turret and 90 mm gun fitted. Sagaie is French for assegai, a type of African spear. Background The ERC was originally a private venture aimed at the export market. It was developed by Panhard in the latter half of the 1970s as a heavier, six-wheeled successor to Panhard's highly successful AML range of armoured vehicles. =Design= The ERC and VCR are a family of six wheel armoured reconnaissance vehicles, the ERC being the cannon-armed turret model and the VCR being the armoured personnel carrier version. ERC is the French abbreviation of term Engin √† Roues, Canon or Gun-armed Wheeled Vehicle. The ERC shares many components of the VCR vehicles. Two main versions of the ERC were developed: first the ERC F1 90 Lynx, then the ERC F4 90 Sagaie. The Lynx appeared about 1977 and the Sagaie followed approximately two years later in 1979. The Lynx was developed primarily as an armoured reconnaissance vehicle. The Sagaie was also an armoured reconnaissance vehicle, with the added secondary role of tank- destroyer. In 1977, Panhard offered the ERC and VCR to the French Army as an armoured personnel carrier (APC) and gun-armed reconnaissance vehicle. The Army instead chose the VAB four-wheeled armoured vehicle from Saviem for the larger APC contract, and the AMX 10 RC from GIAT for the reconnaissance requirement. Panhard also offered the vehicles to France's Mobile Gendarmerie (a much smaller order), but the Gendarmerie chose the Saviem VBC-90. Panhard later found success for both the VRC and ERC in the world export market, and later with the ERC version with the French Army entering service in 1984.Foss, Christopher. Jane's AFV Recognition HandbookFurlong, R. \\"Light Armored Vehicles for French Rapid Deployment Force\\" International Defense Review, May 1981 =Production history= The first production order for the ERC 90 F1 Lynx was in October 1979 from Argentina, for 36 units, to be used by Argentine Marines to patrol the long border between Argentina and Chile. The second large order was from Mexico, for 42 units in early 1981. Both countries ordered the ERC Lynx version because it could elevate or depress its 90mm cannon over a wider range for operations in steep mountain terrain. Further export orders followed. Both nations also appreciated the all-terrain mobility of the Lynx which is enhanced by the capability to raise or lower the central pair of wheels depending on terrain condition, especially in sandy or muddy ground.The French Army's Sagaies now have their middle set of wheels fixed in the down position. All versions of the ERC are also equipped with two hydrojets behind the rear wheels and require no preparation for amphibious operations. =ERC 90 F4 Sagaie= 1 RHP in 2003 Shortly after the ERC 90 F1 Lynx had been built for export, Panhard recognized the need for a cost- effective light armoured vehicle that could defeat a more modern main battle tank (MBT), like the Russian T-72 which was being exported to many nations. The Lynx version could only fire medium-velocity HEAT rounds in the anti-tank role, which lacked the penetration to defeat the more modern MBTs. Panhard designed a turret which mounted the long barrel F4 90mm smooth bore-cannon developed by GIAT, and designated the vehicle the ERC 90 F4 Sagaie. The F4 90mm could fire APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot) rounds at a much higher velocity than the Lynx's F1 90mm; GIAT and Panhard both claimed it could penetrate heavy armour at 2000 metres. For a while, GIAT engineers could not find a suitable muzzle brake for the Sagaie which would not interfere with the firing of APFSDS rounds, but finally found a suitable solution using a muzzle brake design from the older AMX-13 tank. Ivory Coast was the first export customer, ordering five Sagaies to replace its aging AMX-13s in the light armour role. At this time period, the French Army was organising the Fast Deployment Force (FDF) for overseas military missions, mainly in Africa or the Middle East. The main core of the FDF would be French Army's 9th Marine Infantry Division and 11th Parachute Division.In the French army the Marine units are the old Colonial Infantry, Troupes coloniales, renamed Troupes de marine in 1961, and not amphibious units. To make the new FDF \\"more muscular\\" a new unit was activated, the 31st Heavy Half Brigade (31 DBL) of two regiments. One regiment was to be armed with vehicles mounting the HOT wire-guided missile, and the other with cannon-armed vehicles that could provide both reconnaissance and a limited tank-killing role. The French Army had at first planned on equipping the second regiment with the AMX-10RC, but were told that this vehicle was not suitable for transport by the French Air Force Transall C-160 or its allies' Hercules C-130 aircraft due to size and weight issues. In addition, most of the bridges in Africa had only a 6 to 8 ton load capacity. So instead of the larger AMX-10RC, which was already in service with the French Army, the French Army Staff took the surprise step in December 1980 of ordering the Sagaie for the future FDF. And to date the Sagaie has proved very useful for the French Army in its African bases and even in urban conditions during the Siege of Sarajevo. The last known combat uses of the Sagaie were with French troops stationed in Ivory Coast on a peace-keeping mission between two rival factions and in Mali in 2013.  Sagaie upgrade  The French Army has upgraded 160 of its 192 ERC's in service with a diesel MTU 4-cylinder 170 hp engine coupled to an automatic gearbox made by Renk and have made enhancements to the turret to improve observation, fire control and command. =ERC-90 Sagaie 2 (twin-engine)= A weakness of the Sagaie is its low power-to-weight ratio. The Sagaie 2 is an ERC extended with two Peugeot XD 3T four-cylinder turbocharged diesel 98 hp engines; the same engine used on the VBL (Light Armoured Vehicle). Six were ordered by Gabon. A prototype equipped with two PRV V6 engines was built as a private venture, but none were ordered.

History  A number of archaeological sites in the area (such as at Kalambo Falls) provides a record of human activity in the Mbala area over the past 300,000 years. Article by Prof. Desmond Clarke who led the major excavation at Kalambo Falls Before colonial times, Mbala was the village of Chief Zombe on the Lucheche River. It became the focus of British interest as a result of travels by the explorer David Livingstone, the first European to visit the area, in the 1860s. He was followed some years later by Verney Lovett Cameron who surveyed Lake Tanganyika. Livingstone inspired missionaries of the London Missionary Society to come in the 1880s to Niamkolo on the lake and Fwambo and Kawimbe on the plateau. These missions had links to the African Lakes Company which later set up in Mbala and Mpulungu. The area was ravaged by the slave trade during much of the 19th Century, and the African Lakes Company devoted some efforts to trying to stamp it out. This activity drew in the representative of the British Government in the region, Harry Johnston in Nyasaland, and decisions were taken to strengthen the imperial presence south of the lake and prevent other colonial powers establishing a foothold there. Sir Edwin Lutyens As a result, the colonial era began in Mbala in 1893, earlier than in most other areas of what would become Zambia, when Hugh Marshall was sent by Johnston as the British Consul for the area. Marshall built a well-fortified boma at Chief Zombe's village and acted as Magistrate and Postmaster. In 1895 the British South Africa Company took over administration of the territory, called it North-Eastern Rhodesia, and the ‚ÄòZombe boma‚Äô became known as Abercorn, named after the company chairman. The site was favoured by British administrators as being healthy and having a pleasant climate with plenty of hunting and fishing. Until German East Africa was taken over by Britain in 1919 as Tanganyika, Abercorn and the smaller Chiengi boma on Lake Mweru were the most northerly outposts of British southern Africa. During World War I Mbala was a focus of the unsuccessful British military effort to defeat German General von Lettow-Vorbeck‚Äôs German army, and British forces were concentrated there. After Germany's surrender in Europe, von Lettow-Vorbeck formally surrendered at Mbala on 25 November 1918, though he had agreed a ceasefire at the Chambeshi River 250 km south nine days earlier. A memorial marks the spot of the formal surrender about 2 km south-west of the centre of town. Following the surrender ceremony, the German troops were ordered to throw their weapons into Lake Chila. Polish refugees from General Anders' army arrived there during World War 2 and were housed in a camp. A cemetery with Polish tombstones testifies to their past presence.Polskie cmentarze w Afryce Wschodniej After Zambia's independence in 1964, the name of the town was changed back to Mbala. Since its heyday as a colonial town in the 1950s and early 60s, Mbala has suffered some decline, and has lost out in development terms to the provincial capital, Kasama, and Mpika, which have better road and rail connections. Although the Mbala area has fertile soils and plenty of water, it is far from urban markets and transport costs limited the viability of most agricultural crops. Similarly, while it has tourist potential it is a bit too far off the main tourist routes and the poor state of the main highway and the lack of regular air services discourage visitors. There is one hotel but no resorts in the immediate area, the nearest being those in Nsumbu National Park such as Kasaba Bay, 100 km away, but there is no road link there ‚àí in fact the lack of a road serving the south-western side of the lake, which is mountainous, is a serious barrier to tourism or to any development there. Kalambo Falls is an attraction, but is not accessible throughout the rainy season. Wars and unrest on the eastern and northern shores of Lake Tanganyika have also hindered trade and tourism on the lake, which has not given Mbala and Mpulungu the advantages of their location. With recent steps towards resolution of those conflicts, the future may be brighter. The population was 16,963 in the 2000 census.  Geography and transport  The town is at the edge of the plateau covering most of Zambia, at an elevation of 1670 m, about 900 m higher than Lake Tanganyika, which comes within 22 km (straight-line distance). The escarpment above the lake is the end of the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East Africa Rift, and the Mbala area experiences occasional earth tremors. It is also said that the tiny but picturesque Lake Chila within the town experiences inexplicable drying out, and sudden flooding from underground springs, but this may be just a legend.The Times of Zambia: ‚ÄúThe sleeping tourism giant in Zambia‚Äù, Ndola, Friday, May 23, 2003. The second highest waterfall in Africa, Kalambo Falls lies about 40 km (by road) north west, and is formed where the Kalambo River comes over the Rift Valley escarpment.Camerapix: \\"Spectrum Guide to Zambia.\\" Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996. Mbala is on the old Great North Road 165 km north of Kasama, and at one time was the end of that road.Not counting the Mpulungu spur. Later, the Mpika-Tunduma road became the Great North Road ‚Äî see that article for details. It has been paved and as of late 2008 is in poor condition, with large patches of pavement missing, and stretches have reverted to a dirt road. However, work crews were patching the road in late 2008, with one crew starting in Kasama, and the other starting from Mbala.Google Earth has high resolution photos of Mbala and the area to the south clearly showing the road. Since it is the only paved highway access to the town and district, as well as to the port of Mpulungu, its poor condition is a major barrier to development in the area. Buses run daily from Mbala to Kasama and Lusaka, the capital. Mbala is 25 km from the border with Tanzania and connected by a dry- season road to one of only two road border crossings between the two countries. It is not much used, the road beyond the border is a dirt track impassable in the rainy season.Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: \\"Zambia, 2nd edition\\", 2000 The paved road which winds down the escarpment to Mpulungu affords scenic views and passes close to Lunzua Falls. From Mpulungu the MV Liemba provides a boat service to other ports and countries on the lake. In the 19th century the lake was an important entry point to the territory of northern Zambia, by boat from Ujiji, which was reached by an overland trade route from the Indian Ocean coast near the island of Zanzibar. Mbala has an airport but does not currently receive scheduled services, though it has a 2.6 km runway and was once a Zambian Air Force Base.

The KNIL's air arm was the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force. Elements of the Royal Netherlands Navy were also stationed in the Netherlands East Indies.

Its establishment coincided with the Dutch drive to expand colonial rule from the 17th century area of control to the far larger territories constituting the Dutch East Indies seventy years later. The KNIL was involved in many campaigns against indigenous groups in the area including the Padri War (1821‚Äì1845), the Java War (1825‚Äì1830), crushing the final resistance of Bali inhabitants to colonial rule in 1849, and the prolonged Aceh War (1873‚Äì1904).Ibrahim, Alfian. \\"Aceh and the Perang Sabil.\\" Indonesian Heritage: Early Modern History.

(2005) A History of Modern Indonesia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p10‚Äì11 Bali was finally taken under full control with the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906) and the final Dutch intervention in Bali (1908). In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the KNIL resumed the conquest of the Indonesian archipelago. After 1904 the Netherlands East Indies were considered pacified, with no large-scale armed opposition to Dutch rule until World War II, and the KNIL served a mainly defensive role protecting the Dutch East Indies from the possibility of foreign invasion. Once the archipelago was considered pacified the KNIL was mainly involved with military policing tasks. To ensure a sizeable European military segment in the KNIL and reduce costly recruitment in Europe, the colonial government introduced obligatory military service for all resident male conscripts in the European legal class in 1917.Willems, Wim 'Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600‚Äì1942).' (COMT, Leiden, 1994). Chapter I, P.32-33 In 1922 a supplemental legal enactment introduced the creation of Home Guard (Dutch: Landstorm) for European conscripts older than 32.Willems, Wim 'Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600‚Äì1942).' (COMT, Leiden, 1994). Chapter I, P.32-36 World War II KNIL troops marching through Melbourne, Australia, on 14 June 1943 Dutch forces in the Netherlands East Indies were severely weakened by the defeat and occupation of the Netherlands itself, by Nazi Germany, in 1940. The KNIL was cut off from external Dutch assistance, except by Royal Netherlands Navy units. The KNIL, hastily and inadequately, attempted to transform into a modern military force able to protect the Dutch East Indies from foreign invasion. By December 1941, Dutch forces in Indonesia numbered around 85,000 personnel: regular troops consisted of about 1,000 officers and 34,000 enlisted soldiers, of whom 28,000 were indigenous. The remainder were made up of locally organised militia, territorial guard units and civilian auxiliaries. The KNIL air force, Militaire Luchtvaart KNIL (Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force (ML-KNIL)) numbered 389 planes of all types, but was largely outclassed by superior Japanese planes. The Royal Netherlands Navy Air Service, or MLD, also had significant forces in the NEI.\\"Armed Forces of World War II\\" Andrew Mollo During the Dutch East Indies campaign of 1941‚Äì42, most of the KNIL and other Allied forces were quickly defeated. Most European soldiers, which in practice included all able bodied Indo-European males, were interned by the Japanese as POWs. 25% of the POWs did not survive their internment. A handful of soldiers, mostly indigenous personnel, mounted guerrilla campaigns against the Japanese. These were usually unknown to, and unassisted by, the Allies until the end of the war. During early 1942, some KNIL personnel escaped to Australia. Some indigenous personnel were interned in Australia under suspicion of sympathies with the Japanese. The remainder began a long process of re-grouping. In late 1942, a failed attempt to land in East Timor, to reinforce Australian commandos waging a guerrilla campaign ended with the loss of 60 Dutch personnel. Four \\"Netherlands East Indies\\" squadrons (the RAAF-NEI squadrons) were formed from ML-KNIL personnel, under the auspices of the Royal Australian Air Force, with Australian ground staff. KNIL infantry forces (much like their counterparts in the UK), were augmented by recruitment among Dutch expatriates around the world and by colonial troops from as far away as the Dutch West Indies. During 1944‚Äì45, some small units saw action in the New Guinea campaign and Borneo campaign. Just south of Casino, New South Wales, a camp was established in 1942 for a KNIL Technical Battalion. Upon the declaration of the Indonesian Republic, the Dutch soldiers in that battalion interned and imprisoned 500 of their Indonesian native comrades within the camp. Harsh treatment and penalties were issued out by the Dutch on any independence seeking soldiers. This led to the deaths of two KNIL native soldiers; one was a possible suicide and the other was a protest leader. This brought about condemnation from Australian locals, who forced the Australian authorities to repatriate all the imprisoned soldiers, despite being reluctant to heed earlier requests for assistance.

The KNIL and its Ambonese auxiliaries have been accused of committing war crimes during this \\"police action\\". Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony failed and Netherlands recognition of Indonesian sovereignty came on 27 December 1949.\\"Last Post ‚Äì the End of Empire in the Far East\\", John Keay On 26 January 1950, elements of the KNIL were involved in an abortive coup in Bandung planned by Raymond Westerling and Sultan Hamid II. The coup failed and only accelerated the dissolution of the federal Republic of the United States of Indonesia. The KNIL was disbanded by 26 July 1950 with its indigenous personnel being given the option of demobilising or joining the newly formed Indonesian military. However, efforts to integrate former KNIL units were impeded by mutual distrust between the predominantly Ambonese KNIL troops and the Javanese-dominated Republican military, leading to clashes at Makassar in April and the attempted secession of an independent Republic of South Maluku (RMS) in July. These revolts were suppressed by November 1950 and approximately 12,500 Ambonese KNIL personnel and their families opted for temporary resettlement in the Netherlands.The complicated story of the disbanding of the KNIL is set out briefly here. For a more extended analysis see Manuhutu (1987); Steylen (1996: 33‚Äì63); van Amersfoort (1982: 101‚Äì8). The psychological impact of the dissolution of the KNIL on the Ambonese servicemen is described in Wittermans (1991). Following this, the KNIL ceased to exist but its traditions are maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz of the modern Royal Netherlands Army. At the time of disbandment the KNIL numbered 65,000, of whom 26,000 were incorporated into the new Indonesian Army. The remainder were either demobilised or transferred to the Royal Netherlands Army.John Keegan, page 314 \\"World Armies\\", Recruiting During its formation, it was stated that the KNIL would include both European and indigenous soldiers. In the beginning the KNIL was equally divided, which meant that half the army consisted of European soldiers, while the other half was made up of indigenous soldiers.Moor, J.A. de, 'Met klewang en karabijn: militaire geschiedenis van Nederlands-Indi√´ (1815-1949)' in: J. R. Bruin en C.B. Wels ed., Met man en macht. Een militaire geschiedenis van Nederland 1550-2000 (Amsterdam 2003) 199-244, p. 201 However, starting from the late 1830s the ratio between European soldiers and indigenous soldiers went from 1:1 to 1:3.Zwitser, H.L. and C.A. Heshusius, Het koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch leger 1830-1950 (The Hague 1977) p. 12 The reason for this was that there were not enough European volunteers to keep up with the recruitment of indigenous soldiers. Besides European volunteers and indigenous recruits the KNIL also recruited foreign mercenaries of several nationalities during the 19th century.Blakely, Allison (2001). Blacks in the Dutch World: The Evolution of Racial Imagery in a Modern Society. Indiana University Press. p. 15 During the protracted Aceh War the numbers of European troops were kept to 12,000 but continued Achenese resistance necessitated the deployment of up to 23,000 indigenous soldiers (mainly from Java, Ambon, and Manado).Vickers (2005), p. 13 Even slaves of the Ashanti (Ivory Coast and Ghana) were recruited in limited numbers for service in the East Indies (see Belanda Hitam).Radio Netherlands Worldwide ‚Äì Ghana's Java connection The ratio of foreign and indigenous troops to those of Dutch origin was reported to be 60% to 40%. After the Aceh War, the enlistment of non-Dutch European troops ceased and the KNIL came to consist of Dutch regulars recruited in the Netherlands itself, Indonesians, Indos (Eurasians), and Dutch colonists living in the East Indies and undertaking their military service. In 1884 personnel strength was numbered at 13,492 European, 14,982 Indonesian, 96 African (though some sources put the number of Africans much higher \\"Black Face, White Heart: African recruits in the Dutch East Indies army\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, September 6, 2002) and at least 1,666 Eurasian recruits. The officer corps was wholly European and was probably close to 1,300. There were also about 1,300 horses.The Armed Strength of the Netherlands and Their Colonies. Trotter, JK. The British War Office Intelligence Division 1887. . p 162-167. Recruitment was carried out in the Netherlands and India, with over 1,000 Dutch subjects and 500 foreigners enlisting annually. The foreign troops consisted of Flemish, German, Swiss, and French volunteers. Walloons, Arabs, and nationals of both the United Kingdom and United States were forbidden from serving. Other foreigners who could not prove fluency in either Dutch or German were also not accepted for service. It was against the law to send Dutch conscripts from the Netherlands to the East Indies but Dutch volunteers continued to enlist for colonial service in the KNIL. In 1890 a Corps Colonial Reserve (Koloniale Reserve) was established in the Netherlands itself to recruit and train these volunteers and to re-integrate them into Dutch society upon the conclusion of their overseas service. On the eve of the Japanese invasion in December 1941, Dutch regular troops in the East Indies consisted of about 1,000 officers and 34,000 men, of whom 28,000 were indigenous. The largest proportion of these \\"native troops\\" had always consisted of Javanese and Sundanese soldiers.Javanese have always been the largest indigenous element of the colonial army. Cribb, R.B. (2004) 'Historical dictionary of Indonesia.' Scarecrow Press, Lanham, USA., p. 221 The KNIL statistics of 1939 show at least 13,500 Javanese and Sundanese under arms compared to 4,000 Ambonese soldiers.Source: Netherlands Ministry of Defense . During the Japanese occupation, most of the Dutch and Ambonese personnel were interned in POW camps. During the Indonesian National Revolution, the KNIL's officers were still largely Dutch and Eurasians although most of its troops were recruited from predominantly Christian eastern Indonesia, particularly the South Moluccas, Timor and Manado. Although there were smaller numbers of Javanese, Sundanese, Sumatran and other Muslim troops in Dutch service, these received comparatively lower rates of pay than their Christian counterparts, leading to resentment and distrust. The Dutch sought to take advantage of these ethnic tensions by claiming that the Ambonese would lose their special privileges and pensions under a Javanese- dominated government.Kahin, George McT. Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1952. p452 As noted above, these factors contributed to clashes between demobilised KNIL units and the Republic of Indonesia's military throughout 1950.

He currently works in partnership with Donald Norman and Jakob Nielsen in the Nielsen Norman Group, which specializes in human-computer interaction. He was with Apple Computer for fourteen years, then with Sun Microsystems for four years, then WebMD for another four years. He has written two books, Tog on Interface and Tog on Software Design, published by Addison- Wesley, and he publishes the webzine Asktog, with the tagline \\"Interaction Design Solutions for the Real World\\". Background Tog (as he is widely known in computer circles) built his first electro-mechanical computer in 1957, landing a job in 1959 working with the world's first check-reading computer, NCR's ERMA (Electronic Recording Method of Accounting), at Bank of America, in San Francisco. Tog was an early and influential employee of Apple Computer, there from 1978 to 1992. In June 1978, Steve Jobs, having seen one of his early programs, The Great American Probability Machine, had Jef Raskin hire him as Apple's first applications software engineer. He's listed on the back of his book Tog on Interface (Addison Wesley, 1991) as \\"Apple Employee #66\\" (the same employee number he held later at WebMD). In his early days at Apple, simultaneous with his developing Apple's first human interface, for the Apple II computer, he published Super Hi-Res Chess, a novelty program for the Apple II that, despite its name, did not play chess or have any hi-res (high- resolution) graphics; instead, it seemed to crash to the Applesoft BASIC prompt with an error message, but was actually a parody of Apple's BASIC command line interface that seemingly took over control of one's computer, refusing to give it back until the magic word was discovered.\\"Interview: Bruce Tognazzini,\\" Elizabeth Dykstra-Erickson, Interactions vol 7, number 2 (2000) pp41-46, ACM His extensive work in user-interface testing and design, including publishing the first edition, in September, 1978, and seven subsequent editions of The Apple Human Interface Guidelines, played an important role in the direction of Apple's product line from the early days of Apple into the 1990s. (Steve Smith and Chris Espinosa also played a key role, incorporating the initial material on the Lisa and Macintosh computers in the fourth and fifth editions in the early 1980s.) \\"Origins of the Apple Human Interface,\\" transcript of a talk by Larry Tesler & Chris Espinosa, Oct 28, 1997, Computer History Museum\\" He and his partner, John David Eisenberg, wrote Apple Presents...Apple, the disk that taught new Apple II owners how to use the computer. This disk became a self-fulfilling prophecy: At the time of its authoring, there was no standard Apple II interface. Because new owners were all being taught Tog and David's interface, developers soon began writing to it, aided by Tog's Apple Human Interface Guidelines, and reinforced by AppleWorks, a suite of productivity applications for the Apple II into which Tog had also incorporated the same interface. Others often report him as one of the fathers of the Macintosh interface, a claim he has always been careful to refute. Although he did consult with Jef Raskin in the early days of the Macintosh, during the later, critical development period of the Mac, he was assigned to scale down the Lisa interface, not for the Mac, but for the Apple II. Although he and James Batson were able to develop a viable interface for the Apple II that matched the mousing speed of the much faster Macintosh, the Apple executive staff elected not to ship a mouse with the Apple II for fear of cannibalizing Macintosh sales. It was only after Steve Job's early departure from Apple, in 1985, that Tog came to oversee the interface for both machines. During this period, Tog was responsible for the design of the Macintosh's hierarchical menus and invented time-out dialog boxes, which, after a visible countdown, carry out the default activity without the user explicitly clicking. He also invented the \\"package\\" illusion later used by Apple for Macintosh applications: Applications, along with all their supporting files, reside inside a \\"package\\" that, in turn, appears to be the application itself, appearing as an application icon, not as a folder. This illusion makes possible the simple drag-and-drop installation and deletion of Mac applications. While working at Sun Microsystems, in 1992 and 1993, he produced the Starfire video prototype, in order to give an idea of a usability centered vision of the Office of the future. The video predicted the rise of a new technology that would become known as the World Wide Web. Popular Science Magazine reported, in March 2009, that Microsoft had just produced a new video showing life in the year 2019: \\"The 2019 Microsoft details with this video is almost identical to the 2004 predicted in this video produced by Sun Microsystems in 1992.\\"http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-03/future- isn't-what-it-used-be While at Sun Microsystems, Tog also filed for 58 US patents, with 57 issued in the areas of aviation safety, GPS, and human- computer interaction. Among them is US Patent 6278660, the time-zone-tracking wristwatch with built-in GPS and simple time-zone maps that sets itself using the GPS satellite's atomic clock and re-sets itself automatically whenever crossing into a new time zone. In 2000, after his four-year stint at WebMD, Tog joined his colleagues as the third principal at the Nielsen Norman Group, along with Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman.

It is the industrial and commercial center of the Copperbelt, Zambia's copper-mining region, and capital of Copperbelt Province. It lies just from the border with DR Congo. It is also home to Zambia's first modern stadium, the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium. History What is now Ndola was first inhabited by the Lamba people led by Senior Chief Chiwala, in the 1600s, migrants from what is now Tanzania. The name Ndola is derived from the river, which originates in the Kaloko Hills and drains in the Kafubu river. The town of Ndola was founded in 1904, by John Edward \\"Chiripula\\" Stephenson just six months after Livingstone, making it the second oldest colonial-era town of Zambia. It was started as a boma and trading post, which laid its foundations as an administrative and trading centre today. The Rhodesia Railways main line reached the town in 1907, providing passenger services as far south as Bulawayo, with connections to Cape Town. Britannica, Ndola, britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019 The line was extended into DR Congo and from there eventually linked to the Benguela Railway to the Atlantic port of Lobito (which took some of Zambia's copper exports for many years with recent interruptions by closures; the rail line is now back in service). The Ndola railhead was responsible for the town becoming the country's centre of distribution. Before the road network was built up in the 1930s, a track from Ndola to Kapalala on the Luapula River, and boat transport from there to the Chambeshi River was the principal trade route for the Northern Province, which consequently formed part of Ndola's hinterland. In 1961, an airplane carrying key United Nations figures, including the organisation's second Secretary General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, crashed on the outskirts of Ndola. Climate Ndola has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cwa). Industry Emerald from the Kagem Emerald Mine, Kafubu Emerald District, Ndola. Size 3.0 x 2.7 x 2.6 cm. =Legacy= Once the largest industrial centre of Zambia, boasting, among many high-powered sites, company facilities including a Land Rover vehicle assembly plant, Dunlop Tire manufacture, Johnson & Johnson, and Unilever, Ndola's economy shrank significantly between 1980 and 2000. Many closed factories and plants lie unoccupied in the town. A number of former industries such as clothing and vehicle assembly have disappeared completely.BBC World Service Website: \\"The last shirt maker in Ndola\\". David Lyon, 22 May 2004. Accessed 18 March 2007. Even though the term 'ghost town' can no longer apply to it, Ndola is yet to regain its economic glory of pre-1980 days. =Refining= There are no mines in Ndola itself, but the Bwana Mkubwa open-cast mine is only 10 km south-east of the city centre. Until their closure, copper and precious metals used to be brought from elsewhere in the Copperbelt for processing at the Ndola Copper Refinery and Precious Metals Refinery. Copper exports provide 70‚Äì80% of Zambia's export earnings, making the city very important to the country's economy. The Indeni Oil Refinery in Ndola supplies the whole country with refined petroleum. It was repaired in 2001 after being severely damaged by fire in 1999. GL Africa Energy, through its subsidiary Ndola Energy Company Limited, provides 105MW of power to the National Grid of Zambia. Power is generated from heavy fuel oil supplied by the Indeni Petroleum refinery. =Commercial= Ndola is home to one of the country's national newspapers, the Times of Zambia, as well as its printer, Printpak. These run as one company called TimesPrintpak. Catholic church run printing press, Mission Press, is also located in Ndola. Mission Press operates as a commercial entity. The headquarters of the Zambia Postal Service Corporation (Zampost) and workers compensation control board are located in Ndola. Zambia's ultra modern stadium in Ndola (Levy Mwanawasa Stadium) accommodates most Zambia international sports events. One mark of Ndola's commercial significance to Zambia is shown by the presence of the only major centre of operation for the country's central bank, the Bank of Zambia, outside of the capital, Lusaka. Every major bank in Zambia has at least one branch in Ndola. The largest insurance group in Zambia, ZSIC (pronounced 'zeesk'), own many commercial and residential properties in the city. =Limestone= Ndola has huge limestone reserves which are believed to be among the most homogeneous of their kind in the world. Limestone has therefore become to Ndola's economy what copper is to the rest of the country, providing much of the wealth and employment (Lime is a major component in the production of cement; a cement plant getting its lime from limestone and manufacturing a limestone cement will consume well over 80 kg limestone per 100 kg of cement produced). Between 1974 and 2009, Ndola supplied over 50% of Zambia's cement from a plant located some 5 km south-east of the heart of the city. This plant was called Chilanga Cement, Ndola Works. The parent company then was Chilanga Cement plc. Chilanga Cement ran two plants in Zambia: one built in 1949 at Chilanga (hence the parent company name) and the other built in 1969 at Ndola. In 2008, the new holding company, Lafarge Cement Zambia, completed construction of a brand new plant at Chilanga which would produce about double the volume of Ndola Works. By mid-2009, the new plant was still gathering momentum toward full production capacity, leaving Ndola still a significant player in the region's cement industry. Nonetheless, the combination of huge limestone deposits and existing transport infrastructure passing through Ndola has kept the city a very attractive destination for investment into cement production and related activities. A second cement works is under construction in 2008. In June 2009, countrywide advertisements were published to finalise staffing for this new cement plant. Another important processing plant that is based on limestone in the area is Ndola Lime. It is Zambia's sole producer of Lime. Ndola Lime is located near the two cement manufacturing facilities. It supplies the mining industry as well as farmers who require agricultural lime. Ndola Lime company is wholly owned by ZCCM Investment Holdings, a parastatal holdings company via which Zambia's government maintains its active interest in the country's mining and closely related heavy industry. =Cultural Interactions= The four processing plants (the cement plants, the lime plant and Bwana Mkubwa) have mining rights on land located very close to the traditional Chiefdom of Chiwala. Chief Chiwala is therefore a significant interested party to Ndola industry and economics. =Electrical Engineering= Egyptian company Elsewedy Electric joined a consortium of local companies led by ZESCO Ltd (Zambia's electricity supply authority), and established a transformer manufacturing plant and an electrical meter manufacturing plant in Zambia in 2008. Both these facilities are located about 5 km south of Ndola city centre. Transport Ndola is on the Zambia Railways line with passenger and freight services running between Kitwe and Livingstone via Kabwe and Lusaka. Freight branch lines run to other Copperbelt towns and from Ndola to Lubumbashi in DR Congo via Sakania.Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: \\"Zambia, 2nd edition\\", 2000 A dual carriageway links Ndola to Kitwe, the Copperbelt's second city, and other tarred highways link to Mufulira and Lusaka. Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport has scheduled domestic services to Lusaka and international service to Addis Ababa, Johannesburg and Nairobi. It is one of the country's four international airports, others being Livingstone and Lusaka and Mfuwe. Although, Zambia has plans to make the Copperbelt International Airport (right next to the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Crash Site Memorial) the main airport in the district in 2020. The oil pipeline from Dar es Salaam (Tazama Pipeline) terminates at the Indeni Oil Refinery in the town. These factors make Ndola the distribution centre of the Copperbelt and northern Zambia. Sport and recreation As with many towns on the Copperbelt, Ndola's sports and recreation life was heavily supported by the now disbundled mining conglomerate, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM). With the demise of ZCCM, many facilities deteriorated fast. Nevertheless, significant sports places are Ndola Tennis Club (membership), Ndola Swimming Pool (public), the Kanini area (about 3 km from city centre and home to several sports clubs and playing fields like Ndola Wanderers Football Club, a rugby club, and others). About 10 km north-west of the city centre, there is a motor racing track popular with weekend motorbike enthusiasts. The city has several recreational green parks which enjoy a very basic level of maintenance and are open to the public. Of particular significance is the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Crash Site Memorial located some 10 km west-north-west of Ndola city centre. Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Stadium, which was located on the banks of the Kafubu river south of the city, was razed in the 1980s. Its replacement, in the north-west of the city, is the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium with a seating capacity of 50,000. Ndola is home to Zesco United, a top-flight team in the Zambia Premier League.

During its production run up to 1966, the model styling would remain pretty much the same, with the most notable changes coming to the front grille, bumper, and headlights. Powered by a DOHC, water-cooled, four-cylinder inline engine with four Keihin carburetors, the engine capacity was increased to 606 cc from the S500's 531 cc. The engine produced at 8,500 rpm and had a top speed of . With the convertible weighing in at mere , the extra sheet metal of the coupe only added to the overall weight. Suspension was independent with sealed chain drive to each rear wheel. The S600 was the first mass marketed Honda car. First offered only in right-hand drive, it soon became available in left-hand drive to appeal to export markets. There were a few pre-production S500s manufactured in left hand drive, two or three even being shown in some early sales brochures. Both the S600 roadster and coup√© were available in standard trim and a special, upgraded package called the SM600 which included, among other items, special paint colors, exclusive badging, a standard radio and speaker, a special antenna in the passenger side sun visor, standard reversing lights, a standard cigarette lighter, a standard heater, better cushioned seats, and a detachable seat track for quick removal of the passenger seat.

The species epithet literally means \\"dog-head\\" in Greek, due to the dog-like shape of the muzzle and head. Yellow baboons have slim bodies with long arms and legs, and yellowish-brown hair. They resemble the Chacma baboon, but are somewhat smaller with a less elongated muzzle. Their hairless faces are black, framed with white sideburns. Males can grow to about 84 cm, females to about 60 cm. They have long tails which grow to be nearly as long as their bodies. The average life span of the yellow baboon in the wild is roughly 15‚Äì20 years; some may live up to 30 years. Yellow baboons inhabit savannas and light forests in eastern Africa, from Kenya and Tanzania to Zimbabwe and Botswana. They are diurnal, terrestrial, and live in complex, mixed-gender social groups of eight to 200 individuals per troop. They are omnivorous with a preference for fruits, but also eat other plants, seeds, grasses, bulbs, leaves, bark, blossoms and fungi as well as worms, insects, spiders, birds, rodents and small mammals. All species of baboons are highly opportunistic feeders and will eat virtually any food they can find. Yellow baboons use at least 10 different vocalizations to communicate. When traveling as a group, males will lead, females and young stay safely in the middle, and less- dominant males bring up the rear. A baboon group's hierarchy is such a serious matter, and some subspecies have developed interesting behaviors intended to avoid confrontation and retaliation. For example, males have frequently been documented using infants as a kind of \\"passport\\" or shield for safe approach toward another male. One male will pick up the infant and hold it up as it nears the other male. This action often calms the other male and allows the first male to approach safely. Baboons are important in their natural environment, not only serving as food for larger predators, but also by dispersing seeds in their waste, and their messy foraging habits. They are also efficient predators of smaller animals and their young, keeping some animals' populations in check. Baboons have been able to fill a tremendous number of different ecological niches, including places considered adverse to other animals, such as regions taken over by human settlement. Thus, they are one of the most successful African primates and are not listed as threatened or endangered. However, the same behavioral adaptations that make them so successful also cause them to be considered pests by humans in many areas. Raids on farmers' crops and livestock and other such intrusions into human settlements have made most baboons species subject to many organized extermination projects. However, continued habitat loss forces more and more baboons to migrate toward areas of human settlement. The three subspecies of the yellow baboon are: * Papio cynocephalus cynocephalus (typical yellow baboon) * Papio cynocephalus ibeanus (Ibean baboon) * Papio cynocephalus kindae (Kinda baboon) Gallery File:Yellow Baboon, Amboseli National Park, Kenya.jpgAmboseli National Park File:Papio cynocephalus (South Luangwa NP).jpgSouth Luangwa National Park File:Yellow Baboon, Tanzania.jpgSerengeti National Park References External links *Primate Info Net Papio cynocephalus Factsheet *Animal Bytes yellow baboon Mammals of Ethiopia Mammals of Kenya Mammals of Mozambique Mammals of Somalia Fauna of Central Africa Fauna of East Africa yellow baboon yellow baboon ","title":"Yellow baboon"},{"id":"1199219","title":"92nd United States Congress"},{"id":"1199227","text":"The Ford Endura-D engine is a inline-4 Diesel engine used in a variety of vehicles made by the Ford Motor Company, including the Ford Escort (Europe), Ford Focus, Ford Fiesta, Ford Mondeo, Ford Orion, Ford Sierra, Ford Transit Connect and Ford Ikon. / Originally branded Lynx it had 1.8 DIESEL stamped on its rocker cover. It was featured across the Ford range since the late 1980s in models such as the Mk 3 Fiesta, Mk 4 Ford Escort (Europe), Ford Sierra, and Mk 1 Ford Mondeo. The 1.8 itself was a development of the (then all-new) LT 1.6 Diesel unit, originally first featured in the Mk 3 Ford Escort and Mk 2 Fiesta. Still branded Lynx, later engines had Endura-DE stamped on the rocker cover, and first featured in the Mk 4 Ford Fiesta, Mk 6 Ford Escort (Europe) and Mk 2 Ford Mondeo The Endura-DE engine features a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which means there is a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a toothed belt driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the fuel injection pump is rotated by a second toothed belt driven from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is a rotary distributor type most typically made by Lucas CAV.

The diesel injection pump is an electronically controlled rotary distributor type most typically made by Bosch. It has a number of improvements over the previous generation of Ford diesel engines, including the electronically controlled fuel injection pump otherwise known as \\"fly-by-wire\\" In addition, the traditional oil sump is replaced with a cast aluminium lower crankcase and a shallow oil pan; there is an oil-to-water cooler, and a great many detail improvements to parts throughout.

The vehicle is offered in various configurations, and was designed to combine the agility of the Peugeot P4 liaison vehicle with adequate protection against small arms fire, artillery fragments, mines and NBC weapons. Produced between 1985 and 2010, the vehicle has been used by the French Army and other European, African and Central American armies in various conflicts since the 1980s.  Design  The French VBL programme started in 1978. The French Army was looking for a light reconnaissance vehicle, intended to work with the AMX-10 RC \\"wheeled tank\\", the Hotchkiss M201 jeep being obsolete when compared with the Soviet BRDM-2 armoured car. The new vehicle needed to be armed with a single machine gun for reconnaissance (recce) or with the MILAN missile for anti-tank combat, while being protected from NBC hazards and small arms fire. Both Renault and Panhard proposed a prototype, the trials beginning in 1982. Before its selection by the French armed forces in 1985, the Panhard model was ordered by the Mexican Army in 1984. In 1985, a preproduction of 15 vehicles for the French Army was launched while the VBL started its active operational service in the French Army in 1990. The French Army ordered 569 VBLs in 1990, 330 between 1994 and 1997, and 700 VB2L (lengthened variant) before 2004. The VBL, sold abroad as the ULTRAV M-11 has been produced at Marolles-en-Hurepoix, south of Paris. Around ten vehicles were produced each month in 2004. The 1,500th VBL was produced in 2001 and the last VBL of the 2,600 VBLs left the plant in 2010. Internal view of a VBL The VBL has two compartments: a motor bay, placed forward to protect the second compartment, which is for the crew. Its compact internal dimensions led to the design of a lengthened version of the VBL. The crew of the VBL is protected against NBC weapons. The recce versions have two crew members while the anti- tank versions have a crew of three. The French Army version of the VBL is equipped with a Peugeot XD3T turbo-diesel engine. This engine is used on many civilian cars, such as the Peugeot 505, Peugeot 605 and Talbot Tagora. The VBL used many other standard civilian components, too. Its power and power ratio enable the VBL to drive at . It has a fuel consumption of per . Its range of can be extended to by two external fuel tanks. Designed to be lighter than , the mass of the VBL has increased to due to the addition of more weapons, armour and systems. The VBL is fully amphibious and drives at in water; it is also air transportable by C-130, C-160, Il-76 and A400M. It can be transported underslung by larger helicopters, such as the AS332 Super Puma, and may also be para-dropped.

Service history  A Portuguese VBL deployed in Kosovo, 2000. The VBL has been used in many peacekeeping operations of the French Army, notably in Lebanon, Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo. On 13 March 1985, the French contingent of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in Beirut received three VBLs: one used on a static post, another as a liaison vehicle and the last one kept in reserve. The VBL was also often seen in the Siege of Sarajevo, due to the contribution of the French Army to the Blue Helmets in Yugoslavia. It was used as a means of transport by the main commanders of the UN forces, including General Lewis MacKenzie, earning the nickname \\"Sarajevo Taxi\\". Some were captured by the Army of Republika Srpska after the NATO bombings against Bosnian Serb Force. In other missions, a troop of three VBLs of the r√©giment d'infanterie-chars de marine in Rwanda was tasked to make contact with the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the civilian population during the Op√©ration Turquoise, and in Kosovo, the operational requirements of the liaison mission led to the development of the Petit V√©hicule Prot√©g√© program to supplement the VBL. In the 2000s and 2010s, the VBL has also been used by French forces in Ivory Coast. Between 2002 and 2003, the VBLs and the ERC-90s armored cars opened fire on MPIGO rebels to block their incursions. They were later used in Abidjan during the operation to oust Laurent Gbagbo from power in April 2011. In Afghanistan, the VBL units protected Kabul Airport and logistics axes. In Mali, the VBLs were deployed in 2013 in the Operation Serval; in the subsequent Operation Barkhane, several soldiers crewing VBLs were killed by improvised explosive devices. The VBL was also used in the Central African Republic in 2013. The other European VBL users also used their vehicles in peacekeeping missions. Portuguese VBLs have been deployed as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo, working alongside the old Bravia Chaimite for escorts, control missions or mobile checkpoints. In this operation, the Greek military police company, tasked with traffic regulation on the Pristina-Skopje road, was equipped with VBLs. The Greek Battalion of the KFOR fielded six VBLs for reconnaissance missions. The Greek VBLs were also used in North Macedonia in 2001 during Operation Essential Harvest, and in Afghanistan. Besides the French, other VBLs were also deployed in Africa. In Rwanda, the Forces Arm√©es Rwandaises used their VBLs against the Rwandan Patriotic Front during the Rwandan Civil War, with the country's reconnaissance squadron (Escadron de Reconnaissance) having been trained by French advisors to use MILAN ATGMs as well as VBLs. Vehicles captured by the Rwandan Patriotic Army later saw action in the First and Second Congo Wars. In Nigeria, the Nigerian Army used the Panhard VBL as part of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group during the Sierra Leone Civil War. They have seen further use during the Boko Haram insurgency, some being lost to Boko Haram. In the Horn of Africa, the Djiboutian VBLs served against the FRUD during the Djiboutian Civil War in the 1990s: in contrast to the better motorised Humvees, the armour of the VBLs enabled them to resist the rebels' ambushes. Across the Atlantic, the Mexican VBLs faced the Zapatista Army of National Liberation during the Chiapas conflict. Operators  = North America = A FN MAG-armed VBL of the Mexican Army in 2010. The first user of the VBL was the Mexican Army, which ordered 40 in 1984. They were also the first ones to be delivered, in 1985. Three versions were bought: standard armed with a FN MAG, VBL PC (command post, on short chassis) and VBL MILAN. = Europe = A Hellenic Army VBL in 2007. Portugal ordered its first VBL in December 1987. Locally designated M-11 for the short version and M-11D 4x4 M/89-91 for the long version, they have been serving alongside the Bravia Chaimite in the Recce squadron of the Intervention Brigade and in the Recce squadron of the Brigada Aerotransportada Independente. The M-11s are armed with a Browning M1919 machine gun or with a MILAN missile and the M-11Ds with M2 Browning machine gun or SB-40 grenade-launcher on a PL127 ring-mount or with a radar. Greece ordered six VBLs in 1997 to use them in Albania, where the Hummer was too large and too unstable in frozen roads. The success of the vehicles drove to ten more orders between 1997 and 2004. The Greek VBLs are similar to the ones of the French Army, with short and long chassis, some with PL-127 ring-mount or with MILAN missiles. Having received 1,621 VBLs, the French Army has 1,446 VBLs in service in 2019. = Africa = A Gabonese VBL with a CTM-105 ring-mount, in 2009. Niger ordered one VB2L and six short VBLs with 7.62 machine guns in 1985, all delivered in 1986. Gabon ordered in 1985 twelve VBLs for its presidential guard, one with an Elta radar, the others with a 12.7 machine gun on a CTM-105 mount or with an AA-52. Togo ordered and received in 1986 two standard VBLs. Rwanda ordered sixteen VBLs, including VBL PC, VBL standard and six VBL MILAN in 1986. Cameroon ordered in 1987 one VB2L PC and four short chassis others with a 12.7 machine gun on a CTM 105 ring- mount or with a 7.62 machine gun. The 1st squadron of the Guluf Battalion of the Djiboutian Army has been equipped with seven VBLs since 1987. Some of these VBLs are equipped with a NSV machine gun. A first order of 40 VBLs signed in 1985 by Nigeria was canceled but 72 were ordered in 1992 and delivered, including ten with CTM-105 ring-mount, ten VB2L PC and others with FN MAG machine guns. Around 30 were in operational service in 2004. = Arabian peninsula = The Kuwait National Guard received twelve VBL TOW and eight VBL with PL 127 in 1996. All these vehicles are armed with a secondary FN MAG machine gun. Qatar ordered sixteen VBLs, in three versions (standard with FN MAG, CTM-105 and MILAN) to equip a recce squadron. After intensive tests in 1994, the sultanate of Oman ordered more than 132 VBLs for its anti- tank and recce squadrons. Several versions have been ordered, such as the standard FN MAG version, the VBL TOW, the VBL CTM-105 and a version with Mistral SAMs. The Kuwait Ministry of Interior ordered twenty VBL Mk 2 for its special forces in 2008. = Asia = Indonesia ordered eighteen VBLs, armed with the FN MAG, in 1996.

As of December 30, 2016, CSX Transportation served population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. As of December 30, 2016, it had access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. =Conrail= Conrail was the primary Class I railroad in the Northeastern United States between 1976 and 1999. The trade name Conrail is a portmanteau based on the company's legal name(Consolidated Rail Corporation), and while it no longer operates trains it continues to do business as an asset management and network services provider in three Shared Assets Areas that were excluded from the division of its operations during its acquisition by CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Railway. The federal government created Conrail to take over the lines of multiple bankrupt carriers, including the Penn Central Transportation Company and Erie Lackawanna Railway. After railroad regulations were lifted by the 4R Act and the Staggers Act, Conrail began to turn a profit in the 1980s and was privatized in 1987. The two remaining Class I railroads in the East, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), agreed in 1997 to acquire the system and split it into two roughly-equal parts (alongside three residual shared-assets areas), returning rail freight competition to the Northeast by essentially undoing the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad that created Penn Central. Following approval by the Surface Transportation Board, CSX and NS took control in August 1998, and on June 1, 1999 began operating their respective portions of Conrail. The old company remains a jointly-owned subsidiary, with CSX and NS owning respectively 42 percent and 58 percent of its stock, corresponding to how much of Conrail's assets they acquired. Each parent, however, has an equal voting interest. The primary asset retained by Conrail is ownership of the three Shared Assets Areas in New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Detroit. Both CSX and NS have the right to serve all shippers in these areas, paying Conrail for the cost of maintaining and improving trackage. They also make use of Conrail to perform switching and terminal services within the areas, but not as a common carrier, since contracts are signed between shippers and CSX or NS. Conrail also retains various support facilities including maintenance-of-way and training, as well as a 51 percent share in the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad. =Winston-Salem Southbound Railway= The Winston-Salem Southbound Railway is a short-line railroad jointly held by CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway, which provides it with equipment.

Each primary region is divided into two sub-regions: East *Northeast Region, based in Baltimore, Maryland *South Region, based in Waycross, Georgia West *Midwest Region, based in Cincinnati, Ohio *Southwest Region, based in Nashville, Tennessee =Other subsidiaries= *Fruit Growers Express *CSX Intermodal Terminals *CSX Real Property *CSX Technology *Chessie Computer Service *Cybernetics & Services *Total Distribution Services *TRANSFLO Corporation *CSX de Mexico *Powerhouse Logistics History CSX Corporation was formed on November 1, 1980, by combining the railroads of the former Chessie System with Seaboard Coast Line Industries. Original logo for the CSX Corporation, emphasizing the \\"multiplication symbol\\" X The name came about during merger talks between Chessie System and SCL, commonly called \\"Chessie\\" and \\"Seaboard\\". The company chairmen said it was important for the new name to include neither of those names because it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, most of which consisted of combinations of the initials. At the same time, a temporary shorthand name was needed for discussions with the Interstate Commerce Commission. \\"CSC\\" was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in Virginia. \\"CSM\\" (for \\"Chessie-Seaboard Merger\\") was also taken. The lawyers decided to use \\"CSX\\", and the name stuck. In the public announcement, it was said that \\"CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard, and X, which actually has no meaning.\\" However, an August 9, 2016, article on the Railway Age website stated that \\" ... the 'X' was for 'Consolidated' \\". The T had to be added to CSX when used as a reporting mark because reporting marks that end in X means that the car is owned by a leasing company or private car owner. The company introduced its current slogan, \\"How Tomorrow Moves\\", in 2008. The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard, for whom Jacksonville's Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center is named. The first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO. When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president. The company went through major leadership changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX's stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison, known for leading the turnaround three other railroads, as CEO. Within months of Harrison's hiring in spring 2017, several members of CSX's executive management team stepped down. Harrison died on December 16, 2017 and shortly thereafter Chief Operating Officer James M. Foote was named president and chief executive officer. In March 2018, Foote, said CSX would follow- through on Harrison's plans to transform the company and move it from a traditional railroad model to a scheduled railroad model in order to reduce costs and improve the quality of service. Part of this effort includes reducing the number of locomotives in service from 3,000 in late 2017 to between 2,370 and 2,420 in 2020. The company also plans to reduce the number of rail cars it owns from 136,000 in late 2017 to between 104,000 and 109,000 in 2020. In 2017, CSX cut its workforce by 3,300 employees. In 2018, roughly 2,200 jobs were cut. A further reduction of 4,000 positions is planned by 2020. CSX estimates that after these cuts it will have a workforce of about 21,000 people. CSX is also trying to increase profits by monetizing some of its real estate. As of early 2018, the company planned to generate $800 million by 2020 by selling off some railroad lines and other real estate. As of the same date, CSX held real estate in 23 states, the District of Columbia, and two Canadian provinces. Leadership The following is a list of CSX management as of January 2020: *John J. Zillmer, chairman of the board of directors *James M. Foote, president and chief executive officer *Kevin Boone, executive vice president and chief financial officer *Jamie Boychuk, executive vice president of operations *Nathan D. Goldman, executive vice president, chief legal officer and corporate secretary *Edmond L. Harris, executive vice president *Diana B. Sorfleet, executive vice president and chief administrative officer *Mark K. Wallace, executive vice president of sales and marketing Finances At the end of 2018, CSX Corporation's total shareholder's equity was reported as US$12.58 billion and total assets were valued at $36.729 billion. Total revenue for 2018 was $12.25 billion, an increase from $11.408 billion the previous year. Operating income was $4.869 billion, up from $3.72 billion in 2017, while earnings before income taxes were $4.304 billion, compared to $3.142 billion the previous year. As of 2019, CSX Corporation was a Fortune 500 company. Headquarters The CSX Transportation Building is a high-rise office building in Jacksonville, Florida.

T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States established the standard of reasonableness for searches of students conducted by public school officials in a school environment. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, specifically its prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, applies to searches conducted by school officials. However, school officials do not need to have probable cause or obtain a warrant before searching a student. Instead, in order for a search to be justified, school officials must have reasonable suspicion that the student has violated either the law or school rules. The case revolved around a public high school student who was searched for contraband after she was caught smoking.. A subsequent search of her purse revealed drug paraphernalia, marijuana, and documentation of drug sales. She was charged as a juvenile for the drugs and paraphernalia found in the search. She fought the search, claiming it violated the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6‚Äì3 ruling, held that the search by the Piscataway Township Schools was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Background A teacher at Piscataway High School in New Jersey, upon discovering respondent, then a 14-year-old freshman, and her companion smoking cigarettes in a school lavatory in violation of a school rule, took them to the Principal's office, where they met with the Assistant Vice Principal. When respondent, in response to the Assistant Vice Principal's questioning, denied that she had been smoking and claimed that she did not smoke at all, the Assistant Vice Principal demanded to see her purse. After TLO was forced to hand over the purse, he observed a pack of cigarettes. Assistant Vice Principal Choplick kept searching through the purse because rolling papers were in plain view, and his search revealed a small amount of marijuana, rolling papers, a pipe, empty plastic bags, a large quantity of money in $1 bills, an index card that appeared to list students who owed TLO money, and two letters that implicated TLO in dealing marijuana. The principal then called the police and the girl's mother, who voluntarily drove her to the police station. She was convicted of dealing and use of illicit drugs. She was expelled from the school and fined $1,000. Court decision The Supreme Court of the United States, in a 6‚Äì3 decision issued by Justice White, balancing between the legitimate expectation of privacy of the individual, even a child, and the school's interest in maintaining order and discipline, held for the appellant (the state). According to school officials, they do require a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" to perform a search. Her possession of any cigarettes was relevant to whether or not she was being truthful, and since she had been caught in the bathroom and taken directly to the office, it was reasonable to assume she had the cigarettes in her purse. Thus, the vice- principal had reasonable cause to suspect a school rule had been broken, and more than just a \\"hunch\\" to search the purse. When the vice-principal was searching for the cigarettes, the drug-related evidence was in plain view. Plain view is an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the reasonable search for cigarettes led to some of the drug related material being discovered, which justified a search (including the zippered compartments inside the bag) resulting in the discovery of the cigarettes and other evidence including a small bag of marijuana and cigarette rolling papers. Concurrence In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Powell (joined by Justice O'Connor) stated that while he agreed with the Court's opinion, he felt that students in primary and secondary educational settings should not be afforded the same level of protection for search and seizures as adults and juveniles in non-school settings.T. L. O., 469 U.S. at 348-50 (Powell, J., concurring). Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, agreed with the majority's reasoning regarding a balancing approach to school searches. He disagreed, however, with the new standard set down by the Court, which he felt was a departure from the traditional \\"probable cause\\" approach. He explained: : Today's decision sanctions school officials to conduct full scale searches on a 'reasonableness' standard whose only definite content is that it is not the same test as the 'probable cause' standard found in the text of the Fourth Amendment. In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems. Its decision is supported neither by precedent nor even by a fair application of the 'Balancing test of power' it proclaims in this very opinion.T. L. O., 469 U.S. at 354 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 469 * Vernonia School District 47J v.

A release may also be made orally in some circumstances. Releases are routinely used by photographers, in film production, by documentary filmmakers, or by radio and music producers when they photograph, film, video or record the voice or performance of individuals to be sure that the person consents or will not later object to the material being used for whatever purpose the release (or anyone they may assign the release rights to) wishes, i.e. that the release wishes to use the images, sounds or any other rendering that is a result of the recording made of the releasor (or property owned by the releasor for which the releasor may claim some other right such as industrial design rights, trademark or trade dress rights). This will help in insuring the copyright owner has a clean chain of title for any work if it is later published, broadcast, shown in a public cinema or otherwise made public. Releases are very often used to ensure that litigation is terminated when a settlement or compromise between the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) is reached. A general release may release any claims known or unknown that the releasor may have against the releasee. The release may also be very specific, i.e. dealing with specific acts between the parties and not applying to any other acts. Generally a release is of the form: ::For good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I, the releasor, release the releasee for any and all claims I may have against the releasee up to the date of the signing of this release [relating to or arising from _]. ::::/signed/ However, most releases are much more detailed in the recitation of what is being released and the extent of the release (where it is valid, when it become valid if there are conditions on its validity, the amount of consideration if it is substantial) and they are either copied and modified as necessary from various form books or drafting manuals used by lawyers or are preprinted forms that are purchased from legal form publishers. Releases should be drafted by a lawyer, solicitor or civil law notary (not in the United States), except perhaps in the most routine of situations; if the release is not correctly drafted or does not recite any necessary limitations the releasee may find out later that the release did not cover all circumstances, and the releasor may find that the release was too general and released some claim, right or entitlement that the releasor should have retained.

He was appointed as Minister of Finance in June 2008. His last occupation was Ambassador of Venezuela in Cuba since 2014 until his death in 2018.  Career  Born in Ejido, M√©rida, he received his legal certification from Universidad Central de Venezuela in Caracas in 1961. He studied economics, specialising in crude oil; he wrote several works about the energy sector. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he was active in the Marxist guerrilla movement operating in Venezuela. He was known as \\"Commander Fausto\\", allegedly acting as an explosives expert. He was one of the last guerrilla fighters to put down arms, after the so-called \\"appeasement\\" policy (Pacificaci√≥n) signaled the end of the armed insurgency. He was pardoned and became involved in parliamentary politics, and was elected to the then National Congress. He was minister of energy of Venezuela from 1999, when Ch√°vez took office, until 2000. In 2000 he was elected secretary-general of OPEC and served from January 2001 to July 2002. He then became president of Venezuela's state-owned oil company Petr√≥leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), where he masterminded the firing of more than 20,000 workers in response to their part in the company's leading role in the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003.

Launched in 1944, she operated out of Pearl Harbor until 1946, then continued in use out of various ports in the Pacific until the 1970s. She was then decommissioned and re-fitted as a remotely controlled, unmanned acoustic test vehicle known as the \\"Yellow Submarine\\", until she was scrapped in 1988. Name Menhaden was the first submarine and second vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the menhaden, a marine fish of the herring family which is abundant off the Atlantic coast from New England southward. Launch and deployment Menhaden was laid down by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisconsin, 21 June 1944; launched 20 December 1944; sponsored by Miss Mirium R. Johnson and commissioned at Manitowoc 22 June 1945, Commander David H. McClintock in command. Menhaden was skippered by Commander McClintock and manned by sailors from which had been lost by grounding during the Battle of Leyte Gulf the previous October. Menhaden, the last of the Manitowoc-built boats to have commissioned service during World War II, trained in Lake Michigan until 15 July. Thence, she was floated down the Mississippi River to New Orleans where she departed for the Canal Zone 27 July. She conducted extensive training out of Balboa during the closing days of the war against Japan, and between 1 September and 16 September cruised to Pearl Harbor for duty with SubRon 19. Flagship for Admiral Nimitz On 24 November Menhaden broke the flag of Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, CINCPAC and CINCPOA. Fleet Admiral Nimitz had selected Menhaden as his flagship during Change of Command ceremonies, for she combined the new with the old. Although untried in combat, she was one of the newest boats in the Submarine Service and incorporated the latest improvements in submarine design and equipment. Moreover her \\"gallantly battle-tested\\" crew epitomized the \\"valor, skill, and dedicated service of submariners\\" during the long Pacific war. Thus, on her deck that morning Fleet Admiral Nimitz read his orders assigning him to duty as Chief of Naval Operations, and his relief, Adm. Raymond A. Spruance, read orders making him CINCPAC and CINPOA. Menhaden operated out of Pearl Harbor until 2 January 1946 when she sailed for the west coast, arriving San Francisco 8 January. Following inactivation overhaul at Mare Island, she decommissioned 31 May 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She recommissioned at Mare Island 7 August 1951, Lt. Comdr. Ralph G. Johns, Jr., in command. Assigned to SubRon 5, she operated along the west coast out of San Diego during the next year. She again decommissioned at Mare Island 13 August 1952 and began a GUPPY IIA overhaul and conversion to a snorkel submarine. Far East deployments Menhaden recommissioned 6 March 1953, Lt. Comdr. William R. Werner in command. She joined SubRon 3 at San Diego 12 June, and on 21 September she sailed for the Far East. Operating out of Yokosuka, she ranged the East and South China Seas until 11 February 1954; thence, she returned to San Diego 23 March. For the next year and a half she operated in the eastern Pacific where she participated in fleet readiness exercises and type training assignments. On 18 August 1955 she began her second deployment to WesPac where she joined and supported the ever-vigilant Taiwan patrol force. She returned to the west coast 17 February 1956. Menhaden completed six more deployments in the troubled waters of the Far East. As a unit of SubDiv 32, she cruised the western Pacific from Japan and Taiwan to the Philippines and Australia. She carried out surveillance and reconnaissance patrols off past and present areas of Cold War conflict from Korea to Vietnam. When not deployed in the western Pacific, Menhaden maintained a schedule of intensive readiness and alert exercises. Home ported at San Diego, she participated in numerous fleet and intertype exercises. In addition, she supported sonar school operations and provided at-sea training for members of the Navy's Submarine Reserve Force. Vietnam service and fate Early in 1968 Menhaden returned to the western Pacific. During a 6-month deployment she concentrated her operations in the waters off Vietnam. Later in the year she returned to the west coast where she continued to prepare for future \\"keeping-the-peace\\" missions. Menhaden was decommissioned, 13 August 1971, and struck from the Naval Register, 15 August 1973. In 1976, ex-Menhaden was towed from California to Washington to begin a new career as the \\"Yellow Submarine.\\" The boat, stripped of her engines and painted yellow, was operated by the Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station in Keyport, Washington Affectionately referred to as \\"The Hulk\\", she served as a remotely controlled, unmanned acoustic test vehicle capable of submerging to moderate depths in support of undersea weapons testing, and as a target ship to train Trident missile submarine crews off the coast of Washington. In 1988 she sank, due to a leaking main-ballast-tank vent-valve when she was being cut up for scrap. As the tide came in, she was not able to float fast enough to avoid being flooded through all of the holes cut through her pressure hull. The city of Everett eventually finished scrapping the abandoned hulk.

It is confined to steep-sided slopes and the bottoms of rocky canyons in the Santa Lucia Mountains, in the Big Sur region on the central coast of California, United States.  Location  The species may have had a broader range in Paleoendemic era, although some scientists say no fossil evidence of the tree has been conclusively identified. The tree is now confined, possibly due to long-term climatic changes, to a few, small locales that mimic those of the distant past. = Fire susceptibility = The fir tends to be concentrated in steep, rocky, fire-resistant spots at elevations from . Due to the tree's thin bark, it is susceptible to fire, and large stands are always located near high cliffs or in steep, rugged canyons that prevent litter accumulation under the tree canopy and limit the strength of fires. = Known stands = The fir currently grows in a few scattered areas within the Santa Lucia Mountains along the Pacific Slope of California. Four concentrations are found in the vicinity of the Ventana Double Cone and Kandlbinder Peaks, Junipero Serra Peak, Cone Peak, and on the Monterey / San Luis Obispo County line, along San Carp√≥foro Creek within the Hearst Ranch. The most inland stand, from the Pacific Coast, was found in Anastasia Canyon in the vicinity of the Arroyo Seco River and Tassajara Hot Springs. Most stands are found on north- and northeast-facing slopes. Trees are rarely found under elevation. When found at lower elevations, they are always located at the bottom of a large canyon, where cold air drainage enables it to thrive. The lowest stand is found at an elevation of near Ventana Camp on the Big Sur River. This camp is at the bottom of a -deep canyon, in the redwood belt, and is frequently foggy. The northernmost tree was located in 1927 at elevation on Skinners Ridge to the east of the North Fork of the Little Sur River, but it's not known if it survived subsequent fires. = First identified = The first known specimen was collected in 1831 or 1832 by either botanists Thomas Coulter or David Douglas. They likely collected specimens from Cone Peak to the west of Mission San Antonio. Both sent specimens to England, but Coulter's specimen was first identified as bracteata and the name given his species has become the common use. = Cultivation = The tree is a popular ornamental and is found in many arboreta. It grows in an equable Mediterranean climate with considerable precipitation during the winter and very dry summers. No one has been able to introduce it successfully in the eastern United States, but numerous groves thrive in Europe.  Description  The tall tree, has a slender, spire-like form. The thin bark is reddish-brown with wrinkles, lines and resin vesicles ('blisters'). The branches are downswept. The needle-like leaves are arranged spirally on the shoot, but twisted at the base to spread either side of the shoot in two moderately forward-pointing ranks with a 'v' gap above the shoot. The leaves are hard and stiff with a sharply pointed tip, 3.5‚Äì6 cm long and 2.5‚Äì3 mm broad, with two bright white stomatal bands on the underside. The flowers bloom in early May, and the ovoid, 6‚Äì9 cm long (to 12 cm including the bracts) cones mature and release winged seeds from late August to October. The cones differ from other firs in that the bracts end in very long, spreading, yellow-brown bristles 3‚Äì5 cm long. The male (pollen) cones are 2 cm long, shedding pollen in spring.Gymnosperm Database: Abies bracteata Historical uses Resin from the trunk was used as an incense by the early Spanish mission.

He was the party's inaugural Senate leader, and served three terms as Leader of the Government in the Senate. Early life McGregor was born on 18 October 1848 in Kilmun, Argyll, Scotland. He was the son of Jane and Malcolm McGregor. His father was a gardener, and in 1854 the family moved to County Tyrone, Ireland, where he became the chief gardener to Sir Gerald Aylmer (one of the Aylmer baronets). McGregor left school at a young age to join his father. He later spent two years working as an agricultural labourer in England, and then returned to Scotland to work in the Glasgow shipyards.MCGREGOR, GREGOR (1848‚Äì1914), The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate. In 1877, McGregor immigrated to South Australia. He initially worked as an agricultural labourer, and for a period he was employed by Richard Baker, one of his future Senate colleagues. In 1885, McGregor moved to Victoria and found work as a stonemason. He returned to South Australia in 1891 and continued working in the construction industry. He was active in the United Builders' Labourers Society, and in 1892 was elected to the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia. He also became a justice of the peace. Early political involvement In 1893, McGregor became president of the United Political Labor League, a forerunner of the modern Labor Party. He was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council the following year, becoming one of the first members of his party in any Australian parliament. In the Legislative Council, McGregor advocated for new workers' rights, but was also known for his opposition to South Australian involvement in the Boer War and as \\"a fervent protectionist who espoused the sanctity of White Australia\\". Senate 1901 election, including future prime ministers Chris Watson, Andrew Fisher, and Billy Hughes. McGregor is seated in a chair at front, third from left. At the inaugural 1901 federal election, McGregor was elected to the Senate as one of six South Australian senators, and the only one from the Labor Party. He was the final senator to be elected, recording only 644 more votes than his nearest opponent, Andrew Kirkpatrick. However, when he was re-elected in 1903 and 1910 he topped the poll, winning more votes than any other South Australian candidate. When the Labor caucus met for the first time after the 1901 election, McGregor was elected as the party's inaugural Senate leader. His party held the balance of power, and he soon told the Senate that \\"we are for sale\\". Chris Watson, Labor's first leader, described McGregor as \\"a powerful force in our party because of his political sagacity and perfect loyalty\\". Hugh Mahon said \\"his memory was phenomenal, his imagination rich and vivid\\". McGregor was Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council in each of the first three Labor governments ‚Äì the short-lived Watson Government of 1904 and Andrew Fisher's first two governments (1908 to 1909 and 1910 to 1913). As Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1913 to 1914, McGregor had an unusual level of influence due to his party holding a majority in the Senate. In mid-1914, McGregor took leave from parliament due to ill health. He died from a heart condition on 13 August, at his home in Unley. His death came during the 1914 election campaign, and after he had already nominated himself as a candidate. He was given a state funeral and buried at West Terrace Cemetery. Personal life McGregor married twice but had no children. His first wife, Julia Anna Steggall, died only a few months after their marriage in 1880. He remarried in 1882 to Sarah Ann Brock (n√©e Ritchie), who was a widow. McGregor was virtually blind by the time of his death. He suffered a gradual deterioration in his vision, which he attributed to an accident he suffered shortly after arriving in Australia. By the time he took his seat in the Senate, he could only read in the best lighting conditions, and eventually not at all. He compensated for his blindness with a memory described as \\"astounding\\", able to recite lengthy passages perfectly after hearing them read out loud, usually by his mother-in law.Simms, Marian (ed.) 1901: The forgotten election.

The award was bestowed upon him for his actions during the Shimonoseki Expedition, Japan in 1864. He was later discharged from naval service as a result of ill-discipline and moved to New Zealand to work on his family's sheep station. Suffering from depression and alcoholism, he committed suicide at the age of 22 in Dunedin. Early life Duncan Gordon Boyes was born on 5 November 1846 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to John and Sabina Boyes, who had married in Hobart, Tasmania. His father was a merchant, and Boyes was one of nine children. In 1860, Boyes' sister, Louisa Mary, married Thomas James Young, who received a Victoria Cross for his actions at Lucknow, India, in 1857. At least one of his brothers also served in the Royal Navy. Boyes completed his schooling at Cheltenham College before joining the Royal Navy at the age of 14. He was assigned to HMS Euryalus, joining the ship in 1862 when it was serving as part of the East Indies station. The British Naval Brigade and Royal Marines storm the stockade at Shimonoseki in September 1864. Illustrated London News, 24 December 1864. Victoria Cross Boyes received his VC at the age of 17, for his part in action at Shimonoseki, Japan on 6 September 1864. During the fighting, he carried the Queen's Colour as part of the company leading the assault on the Japanese stockade. Boyes was credited with keeping the colours flying despite heavy fire that inflicted numerous casualties. Along with Colour Sergeant Thomas Pride who was badly wounded, Boyes continued pressing forward and only stopped his advance when ordered to do so. The citation was published in the London Gazette of 21 April 1865 and read: Sir Ernest Satow mentioned Duncan Boyes in his memoirs entitled A Diplomat in Japan (London, 1921) in the following terms: \\"Lieutenant Edwards and Crowdy of the Engineers were ahead with a middy [midshipman] named D.G. Boyes, who carried the colours most gallantly; he afterwards received the V.C. for conduct very plucky in one so young.\\"A Diplomat in Japan, first edition, p. 112. Boyes, William Seeley, and Thomas Pride were invested with their Victoria Crosses on 22 September 1865 by Admiral Sir Michael Seymour GCB (Commander-in-Chief to Portsmouth) on the Common at Southsea. Later life Duncan Boyes V.C. in civilian clothes After Euralyus was paid off, Boyes was reassigned to HMS Wolverine, a corvette serving in North American waters. On 9 February 1867, he and another midshipman, Marcus McCausland, were court- martialled for breaking into the Naval Yard at Bermuda. On the night of the incident, the two men had been ashore drinking and upon their return had been refused entry at the main gate as they did not have the required passes. Both men admitted they were guilty of the offence and were discharged from the Navy as a result of the incident. Following this, Boyes suffered from depression and alcoholism. He subsequently moved to New Zealand to join two of his brothers on their sheep station at Kawarau Falls near Queenstown, but after his father died, he suffered a nervous breakdown. On 26 January 1869, Boyes committed suicide jumping to his death from the window of a house in Dunedin. He was aged 22 years and 2 months. The official cause of death was listed as delirium tremens. He was buried locally in the Dunedin Southern Cemetery with a stone at his head and feet, though on 4 May 1954 the Dunedin branch of the Royal New Zealand Returned Services' Association (RSA), in consequence of his VC, reburied him in the servicemen's section of Andersons Bay Cemetery in Anglican Southern Section, Block 6, Plot 24.Dunedin branch ‚Äì RSA Boyes' grave/memorial headstone  The medal  Between 1978 and 1998, the medal was held by Cheltenham College.

Born in Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture, he is noted for his work with anime studio Sunrise. He is married to voice actress Maria Kawamura.  Career  Mamoru Nagano made his professional debut in 1984 working with Yoshiyuki Tomino on the TV series Heavy Metal L-Gaim. Fool for the City, his first manga, came out in 1985 but it was 1986 that brought The Five Star Stories, which is still in production today. Nagano founded Toys Press, Inc. to publish much of his work. His work in Heavy Metal L-Gaim introducing mecha with armor plates that appeared to fit loosely over an internal skeleton. These detailed and somewhat plausible designs sparked a fresh wave of designs in mecha anime. From there, Nagano went on to design elegant and graceful mecha for his manga The Five Star Stories that displayed elongated lines, delicate curves and a degree of decoration and detail that appealed to the imaginations of a generation of mecha fans. Nagano can be called an innovator in the field of mecha design. He has also contributed to the mecha designs of Zeta Gundam. Among his contributions were the Rick Dias and Hyaku Shiki. Nagano is also the co-author (along with Kunihiko Ikuhara) and illustrator of Schell Bullet, a novel in two volumes. Later, he has worked on the anime Gothicmade with studio Automatic Flowers as the producer, director, chief writer, character and mechanical designer for the series.

It is the northernmost of all the baboons, being native to the Horn of Africa and the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. These regions provide habitats with the advantage for this species of fewer natural predators than central or southern Africa where other baboons reside. The hamadryas baboon was a sacred animal to the ancient Egyptians and appears in various roles in ancient Egyptian religion, hence its alternative name of 'sacred baboon'. Physical description Apart from the striking sexual dimorphism (males are nearly twice as large as females, which is common to all baboons) this species also shows differences in coloration among adults. Adult males have a pronounced cape (mane and mantle), silver-white in color, which they develop around the age of ten, while the females are capeless and brown all over. Their faces range in color from red to tan to a dark brown. Males may have a body measurement of up to and weigh ; females weigh and have a body length of . The tail adds a further to the length, and ends in a small tuft. Infants are very dark brown or black in coloration and lighten after about one year. Hamadryas baboons reach sexual maturity at about 4 years for females and between 5 to 7 years for males.Rowe, Noel.

Ecology The hamadryas baboon eats fruit in captivity, although it is not a regular part of its diet in the wild The baboon's range extends from the Red Sea in Eritrea to Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. Baboons are also native to and live in the Sarawat region of southwestern Arabia, in both Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The hamadryas baboon lives in semidesert areas, savannas, and rocky areas, requiring cliffs for sleeping and finding water. Like all baboons, the hamadryas baboon is omnivorous and is adapted to its relatively dry habitat. During the wet seasons, the baboon feeds on a variety of foods, including blossoms, seeds, grasses, wild roots, bark and leaves from acacia trees.Swedell 2002:b During the dry season, the baboons eat leaves of the Dobera glabra and sisal leaves. Hamadryas baboons also eat insects, worms, reptiles, birds, and small mammals, including antelope. The baboon's drinking activities also depend on the season. During the wet seasons, the baboon do not have to go far to find pools of water. During the dry seasons, they frequent up to three permanent waterholes. Baboons rest at the waterholes during midafternoon and also dig drinking holes only a short distance from natural waterholes. Social life =Group organization= Hamadryas harems together The baboon has an unusual four-level social system called a multilevel society. Most social interaction occurs within small groups called one-male units or harems containing one male and up to 10 females, which the males lead and guard. A harem often includes a younger \\"follower\\" male that may be related to the leader.Kummer, 1968Stammbach, 1987 Two or more harems unite repeatedly to form clans.Schreier and Swedell 2009 Within clans, males are close relatives of one another and have an age-related dominance hierarchy.Abegglen, 1984 Bands are the next level. Two to four clans form bands of up to 400 individuals which usually travel and sleep as a group. Males rarely leave their bands, and females are occasionally transferred or traded between bands by males. Bands may fight with one another over food or territory, and the adult male leaders of the units are the usual combatants. Bands also contain solitary males that are not harem leaders or followers and move freely within the band. Several bands may come together to form a troop, usually at sleeping cliffs. =Group behavior= Pair grooming The hamadryas baboon is unusual among baboon and macaque species in that its society is strictly patriarchal. The males limit the movements of the females, herding them with visual threats and grabbing or biting any that wander too far away.Swedell and Schreier 2009 Males sometimes raid harems for females, resulting in aggressive fights. Many males succeed in taking a female from another's harem, called a \\"takeover\\".Swedell 2006Swedell and Tesfaye Visual threats are usually accompanied by these aggressive fights. This would include a quick flashing of the eyelids accompanied by a yawn to show off the teeth. As in many species, infant baboons are taken by the males as hostages during fights. However, males within the same clan tend to be related and respect the social bonds of their kin. In addition, females demonstrate definite preferences for certain males, and rival males heed these preferences. The less a female favors her harem males, the more likely she will be successfully taken by a rival. Young males, often \\"follower\\" males, may start their own harems by maneuvering immature females into following them.Kummer 2001 The male may also abduct a young female by force. Either way, the male will mate with the female when she matures. Aging males often lose their females to followers and soon lose weight and their hair color changes to brown like a female. While males in most other baboon species are transferred away from their male relatives and into different troops, male hamadryas baboons remain in their natal clans or bands and have associations with their male kin. Hamadryas baboons have traditionally been thought of having a female transfer society with females being moved away from their relatives of the same sex.Sigg and Stolba et al. 1982 However, later studies show female baboons retain close associations with at least some female kin.Swedell 2002 Females can spend about as much time with other females as they do with the harem males, and some females will even interact with each other outside of their harems. In addition, it is not uncommon for females of the same natal group to end up in the same harem. Females can still associate and help their extended families despite their interactions being controlled by the harem males. Females within a harem do not display any dominance relationships as seen in many other baboon and macaque species. The harem males suppress aggression between the females and prevent any dominance hierarchies from arising. Despite this, some social differences between the females occur. Some females are more socially active and have a stronger social bond with the harem male. These females, known as the \\"central females\\", stay in closer proximity to the harem male than the other females. Females that spend most of their time farther from the harem male are called \\"peripheral females\\". =Reproduction and parenting= Male, female and infant Like other baboons, the hamadryas baboon breeds aseasonally. The dominant male of a one-male unit does most of the mating, though other males may occasionally sneak in copulations, as well.Swedell and Saunders 2006 Females do most of the parenting. They nurse and groom the infant and one female in a unit may groom an infant that is not hers. Like all baboons, hamadryas baboons are intrigued by infants and give much attention to them. Dominant male baboons prevent other males from coming into close contact with their infants. They also protect the young from predators. The dominant male tolerates the young and will carry and play with them. When a new male takes over a female, she develops sexual swellings which may be an adaptation that functions to prevent the new male from killing the offspring of the previous male.Zinner, D., T. Deschner, 2000. When males reach puberty, they show a playful interest in young infants. They will kidnap the infants by luring them away from their harems and inviting them to ride on their backs. This is more often done by \\"follower\\" males. This kidnapping can lead to dehydration or starvation for the infant. The harem leader would retrieve the infants from their kidnappers, which is mostly an act to protect their offspring. Human interaction =Cultural depictions= Depiction of a hamadryas baboon as the god Thoth (circa 1400 BC), in the British Museum Hamadryas baboons often appear in ancient Egyptian art, as they were considered sacred to Thoth, a major and powerful deity with many roles that included being the scribe of the gods. Astennu, attendant to Thoth, is represented as a hamadryas in his roles as recorder of the result of the Weighing of the Heart and as one of the four hamadryas baboons guarding the lake of fire in Duat, the ancient Egyptian underworld. A predynastic precursor to Astennu was Babi, or \\"Bull of the Baboons\\", a bloodthirsty god said to eat the entrails of the unrighteous dead. Babi was also said to give the righteous dead continued virility, and to use his penis as the mast of a boat to convey them to the Egyptian paradise. Sometimes, Thoth himself appears in the form of a hamadryas (often shown carrying the moon on his head), as an alternative to his more common representation as an ibis-headed figure. Hapi, one of the Four Sons of Horus that guarded the organs of the deceased in ancient Egyptian religion, is also represented as hamadryas-headed; Hapi protected the lungs, hence the common sculpting of a stone or clay hamadryas head as the lid of the canopic jar that held the lungs and/or represented the protection of the lungs. Hamadryas baboons were revered because certain behaviors that they perform were seen as worshiping the sun. =Modern art= The Grand Babouin sacr√© \\"hamadryas\\" is among Rembrandt Bugatti's most celebrated sculptures. =Status and conservation= Captive male at Tierpark Hellabrunn, Germany Transformation of field and pastureland represents the main threat to the hamadryas baboon; its only natural predators are the striped hyena, spotted hyena, and a diminishing number of African leopards that can still be found in the same area of distribution. The IUCN listed this species as \\"least concern\\" in 2008. No major range-wide threats exist at present, although locally it may be at risk through loss of habitat due to major agricultural expansion and irrigation projects. The species occurs in the proposed Yangudi Rassa National Park, the Harar Wildlife Sanctuary, and a number of wildlife reserves in the lower Awash valley and in northern Eritrea.

The breed is referred to simply as the Mastiff by national kennel clubs, including the United Kingdom's Kennel Club and the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. They perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguished by its enormous size, massive head, short coat in a limited range of colours, and always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity. Throughout its history the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \\"mastiffs\\". Appearance Fawn English Mastiff With a massive body, broad skull and head of generally square appearance, it is the largest dog breed in terms of mass. It is on average slightly heavier than the Saint Bernard, although there is a considerable mass overlap between these two breeds. Though the Irish Wolfhound and Great Dane can be more than six inches taller, they are not nearly as robust. The body is large with great depth and breadth, especially between the forelegs‚Äîwhich causes these to be set wide apart. The length of the body taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock is greater than the height at the withers. The AKC standard height (per their website) for this breed is at the shoulder for males and (minimum) at the shoulder for females. A typical male can weigh , a typical female can weigh , with very large individuals reaching or more. =Coat colour standards= The former standard specified the coat should be short and close-lying. Long haired Mastiffs, known as \\"Fluffies\\", are caused by a recessive gene‚Äîthey are occasionally seen. The AKC considers a long coat a fault but not cause for disqualification. English Mastiff colours are apricot-fawn, silver-fawn, fawn, or dark fawn-brindle, always with black on the muzzle, ears, and nose and around the eyes. The Mastiff has a distinctive head with dewlap and flews. The black mask is visible even on this brindle. The colours of the Mastiff coat are differently described by various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours as a base for black brindle. A black mask should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light \\"silver\\" shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. Pied Mastiffs occur rarely. Other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour, other than black, which may no longer exist as a Mastiff colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it has never been determined whether the allele is recessive or a mutation that is dominant.Clarence C. Little, The Inheritance of Coat Color in Dogs, Howell Book House, 1957 Two Mastiffs: one apricot, one fawn The genetic basis for the variability of coat in dogs has been much studied, but all the issues have not yet been resolved. On the basis of what is known (and remembering that, as dogs are diploid animals, each gene location (locus) appears twice in every animal, so questions of dominance also must be resolved), the gene possibilities allowed by the Mastiff standard are AyBDEmh(kbr_or_ky)mS. This describes a dog which is fawn with a dark nose, non-dilute, black-masked, non-harlequin, brindled or not brindled, non-merle, and non-spotted. To allow for the rare exceptions we must include \\"b\\" (brown mask and possible brown brindling), \\"d\\" (blue mask and possible blue brindling), \\"sp\\" (pied spotting), and perhaps \\"a\\" (recessive black). The possible combination of homozygous brown and homozygous blue is a pale brown referred to as isabella in breeds where it is relatively common. On a Mastiff, this would appear on mask, ears, and any brindling that was present. Speculative gene locations may also exist, so a Mastiff may be \\"I\\" (apricot) or \\"i\\" (non-apricot) and perhaps \\"cch\\" (silver lightening) or \\"C\\" (without silver lightening).Sheila M. Schmutz (27 December 2008). \\"Coat Color Alleles in Dogs\\". Retrieved 12 September 2010 (Note that this \\"C locus\\" may not be the same as the one identified in other animals, SLC45A2.) =Record size= The greatest weight ever recorded for a dog, , was that of an English Mastiff from England named Aicama Zorba of La Susa, although claims of larger dogs, including Saint Bernards, Tibetan Mastiffs, and Caucasian ovcharkas exist.Guinness World Records 2000 ‚Äì Millennium edition, Pg 106, Guinness World Records Ltd., 2000, According to the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of Records, in March 1989, when he was 7 years old, Zorba stood at the shoulder and was 8 ft 3 in (251 cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, about the size of a small donkey. After 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records stopped accepting largest or heaviest pet records. Temperament The Mastiff breed has a desired temperament, which is reflected in all formal standards and historical descriptions. Sydenham Edwards wrote in 1800 in the Cynographia Britannica: > What the Lion is to the Cat the Mastiff is to the Dog, the noblest of the > family; he stands alone, and all others sink before him. His courage does > not exceed his temper and generosity, and in attachment he equals the > kindest of his race.

Whittingham The American Kennel Club sums up the Mastiff breed as: :a combination of grandeur and good nature as well as courage and docility. Domesticated Mastiffs are powerful yet gentle and loyal dogs, but due to their physical size and need for space, are best suited for country or suburban life. Health Even at four weeks, a Mastiff should seem massive. At all stages of development, the Mastiff should show the breed characteristics of massiveness and sound, if cumbersome, movement. The Mastiff is a particularly large dog demanding correct diet and exercise. Excessive running is not recommended for the first two years of the dog's life, in order not to damage the growth plates in the joints of this heavy and fast-growing dog, which in some weeks may gain over 5 lb. However, regular exercise must be maintained throughout the dog's life to discourage slothful behaviour and to prevent a number of health problems. A soft surface is recommended for the dog to sleep on to prevent the development of calluses, arthritis, and hygroma (an acute inflammatory swelling). Due to the breed's large size, puppies may potentially be smothered or crushed by the mother during nursing. A whelping box, along with careful monitoring can prevent such accidents. The average lifespan of the Mastiff is about 7 years although it's not uncommon for some to live to 10‚Äì11 years.\\"n=35 median=7.1 IQR=2.01‚Äì9.01\\" Major problems can include hip dysplasia and gastric torsion. Other problems include obesity, osteosarcoma, and cystinuria. Problems only occasionally found include cardiomyopathy, allergies, vaginal hyperplasia, cruciate ligament rupture, hypothyroidism, OCD, entropion, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and persistent pupillary membranes (PPM). When purchasing a purebred Mastiff, experts often suggest that the dog undergo tests for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, thyroid, and DNA for PRA. A Mastiff may be kept in an apartment, but care must be taken to give it enough exercise. Mastiffs should be fed 2 or 3 times a day; it is believed that one large meal per day can increase the chance of gastric torsion. History =From ancient times to the early nineteenth century= There is a ceramic and paint sculpture of a mastiff-like dog from Mesopotamia region during the Kassite period (mid-2nd millennium B.C.). Gallery 406 These dogs may be related to the dogs that fought lions, tigers, bears, and gladiators in Roman arenas.mastiff. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. Chicago, 2012. Accessed 3 October 2013. Certainly an element in the formation of the English Mastiff was the Pugnaces Britanniae that existed at the time of the Roman conquest of Britain. The ancient Roman poet Grattius (or Grattius Faliscus) wrote of British dogs, describing them as superior to the ancient Greek Molossus, saying: > What if you choose to penetrate even among the Britons? How great your > reward, how great your gain beyond any outlays! If you are not bent on looks > and deceptive graces (this is the one defect of the British whelps), at any > rate when serious work has come, when bravery must be shown, and the > impetuous War-god calls in the utmost hazard, then you could not admire the > renowned Molossians so much. The turn-of-the-millennium Greek historian Strabo reported that dogs were exported from Britain for the purpose of game hunting, and that these dogs were also used by the Celts as war dogs. As far as the origin of the Pugnaces Britanniae is concerned, there is unproven speculation that they were descended from dogs brought to Britain by the Phoenicians in the 6th century BC.Leighton, R. (1907). The New Book of the Dog. Cassell. This breed's first written accounts in England date back to 55 BC when Caesar noted them during his invasions. Many were sent to Italy and in the Roman Empire they became fighting dogs. The Alaunt is likely to have been another genetic predecessor to the English Mastiff. Introduced by the Normans, these dogs were developed by the Alans, who had migrated into France (then known as Gaul) due to pressure by the Huns at the start of the fifth century. Intriguingly they were known from the Romans to live in a region (the Pontic-Caspian Steppe) about 700 km to the north of the region where the Assyrians once lived. Again, any canine connections are speculative.Hancock, David (2001). The Mastiffs: The Big Game Hunters The linguistic origin of the name \\"Mastiff\\" is unclear. Many claim that it evolved from the Anglo-Saxon word \\"masty\\", meaning \\"powerful\\". Other sources, such as the Oxford English Dictionary, say the word originated from the Old French word mastin (Modern French m√¢tin), the word being itself derived from Vulgar Latin *ma(n)suetinus \\"tame\\", see Classical Latin mansuetus with same meaning. The first list of dog breed names in the English language, contained within The Book of Saint Albans, published in 1465, includes \\"Mastiff \\". This work is attributed to Prioress Juliana Berners, but in part may be translated from the early 14th century Norman-French work Le Art de Venerie, by Edward II's Huntmaster Guillaume Twici. In 1570, Conrad Heresbach, in Rei Rusticae Libri Quatuor, referred to \\"the Mastie that keepeth the house\\".Andersson, D. D. (1999). The Mastiff: Aristocratic Guardian. Doral Publishing. Heresbach was writing in Latin; his work was translated a few years later into English by Barnabe Googe as Foure Bookes of Husbandrie.Foure bookes of husbandrie, collected by M. Conradus Heresbachius, councellour to the high and mightie prince, the Duke of Cleue: containing the whole art and trade of husbandry, gardening, graffing, and planting, with the antiquitie, and commendation thereof. Newly Englished, and increased by Barnabe Googe, Esquire, Conrad Heresbach, [Rei rusticae libri quatuor. English] London : Printed by T. Este, for Thomas Wight, 1596 This work was originally adapted from De Re Rustica by 1st century Roman writer Columella, which highlights the Roman connection. Certainly from Roman to Medieval times, Mastiff-like dogs were used in the blood sports of bear-baiting, bull-baiting, lion-baiting, and dog fighting, as well as for hunting and guarding. A painting of about 1650 by Abraham Hondius of a bear-baiting with dogs including at least one apparent Mastiff. Dogs known as Bandogs, who were tied (bound) close to houses, were of Mastiff type.A picture of 1804 by Philip Reinagle, engraved by John Scott, showing a Mastiff of the Bandog type.They were described by John Caius in 1570 as vast, huge, stubborn, ugly, and eager, of a heavy and burdensome body. The naturalist Christopher Merret in his 1666 work Pinax Rerum Naturalium Brittanicarum has a list of British mammals, including 15 kinds of dog, one of which is \\"Molossus, Canis bellicosus Anglicus, a Mastif\\". Literally, \\"Molossus, warlike English dog, a Mastiff\\", and perhaps the first conflation of the breeds Molossus and Mastiff. Alpine Mastiff (1805), contributor to the modern Mastiff along with his contemporaries of English stock. When in 1415 Sir Peers Legh was wounded in the Battle of Agincourt, his Mastiff stood over and protected him for many hours through the battle. The Mastiff was later returned to Legh's home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs. Five centuries later this pedigree figured prominently in founding the modern breed.Homan, M. (2000). A Complete History of Fighting Dogs (Pg.10) Howell Book House Inc. Other aristocratic seats where Mastiffs are known to have been kept are Elvaston Castle (Charles Stanhope, 4th Earl of Harrington and his ancestors) and Chatsworth House. The owner of the Chatsworth Mastiffs (which were said to be of Alpine Mastiff stock) was William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, known to his family as Canis. Mastiffs were also kept at Hadzor Hall, owned by members of the Galton family, famous for industrialists and scientists, including Charles Darwin. Some evidence exists that the Mastiff first came to America on the Mayflower, but the breed's further documented entry to America did not occur until the late 19th century. =From the early nineteenth century to the First World War= In 1835, the Parliament of the United Kingdom implemented an Act called the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, which prohibited the baiting of animals. This may have led to decline in the aggressive Mastiffs used for this purpose, but Mastiffs continued to be used as guards for country estates and town businesses. Systematic breeding began in the 19th century,The History of the Mastiff, M. B. Wynn 1885. William Loxley. when J.W. (John Wigglesworth) Thompson purchased a bitch, Dorah, from John Crabtree, the head gamekeeper of Kirklees Hall, whose dogs were often held in the name of his employer, Sir George Armitage. Dorah was descended in part from animals owned by Thompson's grandfather Commissioner Thompson at the beginning of the century, as well as a Mastiff of the Bold Hall line (recorded from 1705), a bitch purchased from canal boat men, another caught by Crabtree in a fox trap, a dog from Nostal priory and another dog from Walton Hall, owned by the naturalist, Charles Waterton. J. W. Thompson's first stud dog, Hector, came from crossing a bitch, Juno, bought from animal dealer Bill George, to a dog, Tiger, owned by a Captain Fenton. Neither of these had any pedigree, as was normal for the period. Between 1830 and 1850 he bred the descendants of these dogs and some others to produce a line with the short, broad head and massive build he favoured. In 1835, T.V.H. Lukey started his operations by breeding an Alpine Mastiff bitch of the Chatsworth line, Old Bob-Tailed Countess (bought from dog dealer Bill White), to Pluto, a large black Mastiff of unknown origin belonging to the Marquis of Hertford. The result was a bitch called Yarrow, who was mated to Couchez, another Alpine Mastiff belonging (at the time) to White and later mated to a brindle dog also in White's possession. Lukey produced animals that were taller but less massive than Thompson's. After 1850, Thompson and Lukey collaborated, and the modern Mastiff was created, though animals without pedigree or of dubious pedigree continued to be bred from into the 20th century. crop-eared black Mastiff Pluto (1830) Another important contribution to the breed was made by a dog called Lion, owned by Captain (later Colonel) John Garnier of The Royal Engineers.\\"The chronicles of the Garniers of Hampshire during four centuries, 1530‚Äì1900\\" (https://archive.org/stream/chroniclesofgarn00garn/chroniclesofgarn00garn_djvu.txt) He bought two Mastiffs from the previously mentioned dealer Bill George. The bitch, Eve, bought by George at Leadenhall Market, was old enough to be grey- muzzled, but of good type. The dog, Adam, was of reputed Lyme Hall origin, but bought at Tattersalls and suspected by Garnier of containing a \\"dash of Boarhound\\", an ancestral form of Great Dane. Garnier took them with him when he was posted to Canada and brought back their puppy, Lion. He was bred to Lukey's Countess to produce Governor, the source of all existing male Mastiff lines. (Lion was also mated to Lufra, a Scottish Deerhound, and their puppy Marquis appears in the pedigrees of both Deerhounds and Irish Wolfhounds.)Lukey's Governor, born 1861, a six generation ancestor of Ch. Crown PrinceThe controversial Ch. Crown Prince, pictured in old age. In the 1880s soundness was sacrificed for type, which was widely attributed to the short-headed, massive, but straight-stifled and chocolate-masked Ch. Crown Prince. This dog dominated all of his contemporaries in terms of the number of offspring. Subsequently, the Mastiff lost popularity but gained a consistency of type, with leaner, longer-headed specimens becoming relatively less common.John Paul's 1867 painting showing a typical mid-19th century longer- headed apricot brindle. Prominent among the breeders of this era who began to restore soundness were Edgar Hanbury and his relation, the politician and philanthropist Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, later Chairman of The Kennel Club, who reaching his peak as a breeder with the Crown Prince grandson, Ch. Beaufort, eventually exported to America. Beaufort, acclaimed 19th century champion, grandson of Crown Prince. AKC recognition occurred in 1885. Despite such imports, Mastiff numbers in the US declined steadily through the 1890s and the early 20th century. From 1906 to 1918, only 24 Mastiffs were registered in the United States. After 1910, none of these were bred in America. By the time the First World War ended, other than a few exports to North America, the breed was extinct outside of Great Britain. =After the First World War= In 1918, a dog called Beowulf, bred in Canada from British imports Priam of Wingfied and Parkgate Duchess, was registered by the American Kennel Club, starting a slow re-establishment of the breed in North America. Priam and Duchess, along with fellow imports Ch Weland, Thor of the Isles, Caractacus of Hellingly and Brutus of Saxondale, ultimately contributed a total of only two descendants who would produce further offspring: Buster of Saxondale and Buddy. There were, however, a number of other imports in the period between the wars and in the early days of the Second World War Those who can still be found in modern pedigrees were 12 in number,(1) Roxbury Boy, (2) Millfold Lass, (3) Buzzard Pride (survived only by Merle's Brunhilda of Lyme Hall, who was in turn survived only by Shanno of Lyme Hall), (4) Gyn of Hammercliffe, (5) Duke of Hellingly, (6) Kathleen of Hellingly, (7) King of Hellingly (survived only by Eric of Altnacraig), (8) Maude of Hellingly, (9) Crusader of Goring (survived only by Blythe of Hampden), (10) Goldhawk Elsie, (11) Broomcourt Nell, (12) Rolanda, The History & Management of the Mastiff, Author(s): Baxter, Elizabeth J; Hoffman, Patricia B., Dogwise 2004 meaning the North American contribution to the gene pool after 1945 (including Buster and Buddy) consisted of 14 Mastiffs. In the British Isles during the Second World War virtually all Mastiff breeding stopped due to the rationing of meat. After the war, such puppies as were produced mostly succumbed to canine distemper, for which no vaccine was developed until 1950. Only a single bitch puppy produced by the elderly stock that survived the war reached maturity, Nydia of Frithend. Her sire had to be declared a Mastiff by the Kennel Club, as his parentage was unknown, and he was thought by some to be a Bullmastiff. After the war, animals from North America (predominantly from Canada) were imported into Britain. Therefore, all Mastiffs in the late 1950s were descended from Nydia and the 14 Mastiffs previously mentioned, with each all-male bloodline going back to Ch. Crown Prince. It has been alleged that the Mastiff was bred with other more numerically significant giant breeds such as Bullmastiffs and St. Bernards, with the justification that these were considered close relatives to the Mastiff. In 1959, a Dogue de Bordeaux, Fidelle de Fenelon, was imported from France to the US, registered as a Mastiff, and became the 16th animal in the post-war gene pool.The History & Management of the Mastiff, Author(s): Baxter, Elizabeth J; Hoffman, Patricia B., Dogwise 2004 Since that time, the breed has gradually been restored in Britain, has reached 28th most popular breed in the US, and is now found worldwide.

Hayne was president of the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad, until his death, and was succeeded as its president by James Gadsden. The LCCR bought the SCCRC's stock in 1839 and the two railroads merged in 1844, but never completed the track as expected, only finishing about 60 miles to Columbia, South Carolina in addition to connections to Camden, South Carolina in 1848 and Atlanta, Georgia in 1853. Political career A Democrat, Hayne elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and served from 1814 to 1818, including as Speaker of the House in 1818. Hayne was Attorney General of South Carolina from 1818 to 1822. During his tenure, the trial of Denmark Vesey occurred in Charleston after a purported slave rebellion was thwarted. Governor Thomas Bennett, unsupportive of the city-appointed court handling the trial, asked Hayne for his legal opinion on the matter. Hayne advised Bennett that the \\"Magna Charta and Habeas Corpus and indeed all the provisions of our Constitution in favour of Liberty, are intended for freemen only\\" and that the Governor of South Carolina did not have the ability to examine \\"judicial errors.\\"Denmark Vesey and His Co- Conspirators Author(s): Michael P. Johnson Source: The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 2001), pp. 915-976 Published by: Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2674506 Accessed: 15-04-2020 00:45 UTC In 1822 South Carolina's legislature elected Hayne to the United States Senate. He was reelected in 1828 and served from March 4, 1823, to December 13, 1832. From 1825 to 1832 he was Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. In 1832, under James Hamilton Jr. as governor, Hayne served as Chairman of South Carolina's nullification convention. Hamilton and Hayne argued that states could \\"nullify\\" federal laws with which they did not agree. Eighty percent of its 162 delegates voted to nullify federal tariffs of 1828 and 1832, and for the Ordinance of Nullification. A temporary compromise was reached between the federal government and South Carolina in 1833. Hayne resigned from the Senate to accept election by the legislature as Governor of South Carolina in 1832, serving one term into 1834. From 1836 to 1837 he served as Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina. Death and legacy Hayne died in Asheville, North Carolina on September 24, 1839. He is buried at St. Michael's Church cemetery in Charleston.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8184382 His transcontinental railroad dreams never materialized. His son-in-law, Capt. Elam Sharpe Jr., fought with the First South Carolina Cavalry, Hampton's Brigade during the Civil War and survived. However, he and his family sold their plantations and invested the proceeds in Confederate bonds. After the war, the family's finances were in dire condition, so Sharpe moved his family to Tennessee, then Dallas, Texas, where he became a Presbyterian minister.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/176130283/elam-sharpe Hayne's descendants sold the Ladson Street house in 1863, but it still exists today, albeit moved and renovated in 1890.\\"Robert Young Hayne.\\" http://www.HalseyMap.com/Flash/mayors-detail.asp?polID=28 Hayne's nephew, Paul Hamilton Hayne, was a poet and South Carolina's poet laureate who moved to Georgia after the Civil War. In 1878 he published a biography of Hayne. The World War II Liberty ship was named in his honor. Political views Hayne was an ardent free-trader and an uncompromising advocate of states' rights. He consistently argued that slavery was a domestic institution and should be dealt with only by the individual states. He opposed the federal government's plan to send delegates to the Panama Congress, which was organized by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var to develop a united North and South American policy towards Spain, including the end of slavery in Spain's former colonies. (After achieving independence, Mexico ended slavery in 1836.) Objecting to any federal effort to curtail slavery, Hayne said, \\"The moment the federal government shall make the unhallowed attempt to interfere with the domestic concerns of the states; those states will consider themselves driven from the Union.\\" His remarks are considered an early description of the idea of Secession, which culminated with the American Civil War. He opposed the protectionist federal tariff bills of 1824, 1828, and 1832. In 1828, in response to the changing economic landscape in Massachusetts (there was a shift from farming towards mass production in factories), Daniel Webster backed a high-tariff bill to enhance the profitability of manufacturing interests in his home state. This angered Southern leaders who would have to pay higher prices for manufactured goods, and brought Webster into dispute with Hayne. Their disagreement over the powers of the federal government later evolved into a series of back-and-forth Senate speeches that became known as the Webster-Hayne debate. The debate arose over the \\"Foot resolution,\\" introduced on December 29, 1829New International Encyclopedia by Senator Samuel A. Foot of Connecticut. Foot's proposal called for a federal government study into restricting the sale of public lands to those lands already surveyed and available for sale, which would prevent states from conducting further land sales. Whether the federal government had the authority to take this action called into question the relationship between the powers of the federal government and the governments of the individual states. Hayne contended that the United States Constitution was only a compact between the national government and the states, and that any state could nullify any federal law which it considered to be in contradiction. Webster argued for the supremacy of the federal government and the Constitution, and against nullification and secession. He concluded his Second Reply to Hayne with the memorable phrase, \\"Liberty and union, now and forever, one and inseparable.\\" References Further reading * Hayne, Paul H. Lives of Robert Y.

In the late 1970s, Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini entered into an agreement with BMW to build a production racing car in sufficient quantity for homologation, but conflicts arose that prompted BMW to produce the car themselves. The resulting car was sold to the public, from 1978 to 1981, as the BMW M1. It is the first mid-engine BMW automobile to be mass-produced; the second is the i8 plug-in hybrid sports car.  Overview  = Development history = The M1 has a tubular steel space-frame chassis Motorsport division of BMW headed by Jochen Neerpasch had been wanting to compete in motorsports using a car developed for competition racing in order to compete with arch rival Porsche in Group-5 racing, thus the development of the M1 was initiated. Neerpasch, who was head of the development program stressed that the car was to be strictly mid-engine in order to outclass its competitors. As BMW wasn't able to build 400 road going examples of the car in the required time period as stipulated by the rules, the company partnered with Lamborghini to work out the details of the car's chassis, assemble prototypes and manufacture the vehicles. The tubular steel space frame chassis was the work of Gianpaolo Dallara but soon Lamborghini's financial position and the possibility of the car's production by the Italian manufacturer became bleak and BMW reassumed control over the project in April 1978, after seven prototypes were built. The delay in production and the changes in Group 5 rules forced the company to compete in Group 4 racing with the car. The M1 coup√© was hand-built between 1978 and 1981 under the motorsport division of BMW as a homologation special for sports car racing. The fibre glass body was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, taking inspiration from the 1972 BMW Turbo concept car. Since the engineering of the car was still incomplete, a group of former Lamborghini engineers had founded a company named Italengineering which offered to complete the car's design. Less than 10 miles away from the Lamborghini shop, the engineering for the M1 was finished. = Engine and transmission = The 3.5-litre M88/1 inline-6 engine The BMW M1 is the first car to be solely developed by BMW M and employs a M88/1 petrol six-cylinder engine with Kugelfischer-Bosch mechanical fuel injection and Magneti-Marelli ignition system. The engine was developed by Paul Rosche, who was also responsible for the S14 inline-4 engine and the S70/2 V12 engine. A version of this engine was later used in the South African version of the 745i, of which 209 examples were built between 1984 and 1986, as well as the E24 M6/M635CSi and E28 M5. The engine has six separate throttle bodies, twin-cams, 4 valves per cylinder, and generates a power output of at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm in the road version, giving the car a top speed of . The engine was mated to a 5-speed manual transmission made by ZF Friedrichshafen equipped with a 40% locking limited slip differential. = Steering, suspension and brakes = The M1 has an unassisted rack and pinion steering, double wishbone suspension system with adjustable coil springs and Bilstein gas filled dampers. The road car had softer suspension bushings to have better ride quality and tractability. The ventilated brakes of the car measured at the front and at the rear and were constructed from steel. The M1 used special Campagnolo alloy wheels measuring 7x16-inches at the front and 8x16-inches at the rear fitted with Pirelli P7 tyres (having sizes of 205/55 VR15 at the front and 225/50 VR15s at the rear). = Interior = Interior The M1 has a half-leather and half-cloth interior. Its motorsport roots meant that the car had a basic interior layout with many parts sourced from other BMW models. The interior had amenities such as air-conditioning, power windows and a stereo but had unadjustable seats and only had a left hand drive configuration. = Production = The fibre glass body of the M1 was manufactured by Italian firm Italina Resina which was located in Modena, Italy. The chassis was manufactured by another Modenese firm, Marchesi. The body of the car was completed by Italdesign at their manufacturing facility located in Turin along with the interior. The partly finished cars were then delivered to German specialist manufacturer Baur where final assembly took place by hand. The hand-built M88/1 engines were supplied by BMW from Munich to be installed in the cars. The completed cars were shipped to BMW Motorsport in Munich for final inspection and delivery. Only 453 production cars were built, making it one of BMW's rarest models. Out of the 453, 399 were road going units while 53 were made for motorsport. = Accolades = Rear 3/4 view The M1 had various successes in motorsports. In 2004, Sports Car International placed the car at number ten on their list of top sports cars of the 1970s. = Note = The M1 is not related to BMW's 1 Series compact executive car which started production in the 2004 model year, nor is it related to the BMW 1 Series M Coup√© which started production in the 2010 model year and is a high performance variant of the 1 Series.  Motorsport  A BMW M1 Procar being driven by Nelson Piquet in 1980 at the N√ºrburgring In 1979 the head of BMW Motorsport, Jochen Neerpasch, devised a one-make championship using racing modified M1s. The series was created to aid BMW in building enough cars to enter the group 4 classification in the World Championship for Makes. The new series, known as the \\"Procar BMW M1 Championship\\", served as a support series for Formula One, and included many Formula One drivers in identical cars. The series ran for two years, with Niki Lauda winning the 1979 season, and Nelson Piquet the 1980 season. After BMW met the standards for group 4, the Procars were used by various teams in the world championship as well as other national series. The M1 was also campaigned at the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1981 to 1986 where it proved competitive. The car was classified as a Group B car for Le Mans purposes, as Group B was also planned for GT class for road races, but were instead eclipsed by Group C prototypes. A M1 Pro Car was also converted to Group B rally spec by BMW France for the 1982 season. The car was campaigned for the 1983 season as well before the car was entered solely by the Motul privateer racing team for the 1984 season. The 1984 season proved to be the most successful for the M1 as former ERC champion Bernard B√©guin won back-to-back at Rallye de La Baule and Rallye de Lorraine that season, and even claimed an outright ERC podium at Rally d‚ÄôAntibes four months later. The car was not campaigned further after 1984.  Commemorative cars and spiritual successor  = M1 Homage concept = In April 2008, BMW unveiled the M1 Homage concept, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the M1. The concept vehicle uses a mid-engine layout that borrows styling cues from both the original M1 and the BMW Turbo show car. The M1 Homage concept was first shown to the public at the of 2008. The design was penned by BMW's in-house design team, inspired by both the original M1 and the BMW Turbo concept designed by Paul Bracq. The BMW Turbo had many technical and advanced innovations from BMW that were part of the inspiration of the M1 Homage concept. The front of the car differs the most from the other parts of the car. The front sports double head lights which are not the same as pop-up type that are on the original M1, but the usual trademark of the kidney grilles is present. The M1 Homage also incorporates the double badge on the back of the car like the original M1. There are no photos of the interior of the car or of the car in action, nor have the specifications of the car been released as the car was meant only to be a design exercise. = Vision EfficientDynamics concept and the BMW i8 = Vision EfficientDynamics concept at the Johannesburg International Motor Show in 2011 BMW i8 frontal view (production model) After the M1, BMW designed some mid engined concept cars but none of them inspired a production car until 2013, when the Vision EfficientDynamics concept led to the production of the i8. The BMW i8 is based on the Vision EfficientDynamics concept, which is a range-extender electric car with a three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine. The production car was designed by Benoit Jacob. Series production of customer vehicles began in April 2014. It is also the first mass-produced mid-engine BMW automobile since the M1. = Vision M Next concept = The Vision M Next is a plug-in hybrid concept sports car that was showcased in June 2019. The design is partially inspired from the M1, such as louvered rear windows and BMW roundels that is positioned inside the taillamps. It is powered by the Power PHEV drivetrain system that offers the choice between all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive, with either all-electric propulsion or the power of a turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine. The total system output is claimed at . It also has a claimed 0 to acceleration time of 3 seconds and top speed of .

A celebrity chef, he was a household name during the 19th century, and his 1817 cookbook, The Cook's Oracle, was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and the United States. The origin of the crisp (also known as potato chip) is attributed to Kitchiner, with The Cook's Oracle including the earliest known recipe. Unlike most food writers of the time he cooked the food himself, washed up afterwards, and performed all the household tasks he wrote about. He travelled around with his portable cabinet of taste, a folding cabinet containing his mustards and sauces. He was also the creator of Wow-Wow sauce.  The Cook's Oracle by William Kitchiner  Richard Martin, William Kitchiner, Samuel Phillips Eady: Martin's Bill in Operation (published 1924). Kitchiner's most well-known book The Cook's Oracle, full title Apicius Redivivus, or the Cook's Oracle, was first published in 1817. It is also known as The Cook's Oracle: Containing receipts for plain cookery on the most economical plan for private families, etc. The Cook's Oracle includes eleven ketchup recipes, including two each for mushroom, walnut and tomato ketchups, one each for cucumber, oyster, cockle and mussel ketchups, and also a recipe for Wow-Wow sauce. The book contains what may be one of the earliest references to crisps, in a recipe for \\"Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings\\", which instructs the reader to \\"peel large potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping\\".  Life  Kitchiner was born in 1778, the son of a prosperous merchant. His father's legacy meant he did not have to work, but instead was able to live on his own means. Although claiming to have been educated at Eton and Glasgow, he attended neither institution, but the link to Glasgow enabled him to claim to be a medical doctor (M.D.), a claim no-one checked. His love life was chequered: he married, separated, and had an illegitimate son, who he acknowledged and funded. He surrounded himself with like-minded individuals, setting up a 'committee of taste' which revolved around dinners, hosted by himself or held elsewhere. His dinners were renowned and made him something of a celebrity within a certain circle. He was very important for that reason Unlike most food writers of the time he cooked the food himself, (not alone), washed up afterward, and performed all the household tasks he wrote about. In his writings he extolled the virtues of a magazine of taste, a 'pyramidical epergne' which could also be made into a portable traveling case, and which contained 28 different ingredients including liqueurs, spice blends, and proprietary sauces. He died in 1827 of an apparent heart attack, the day before he was due to change his will to remove his son, whom he had decided no longer merited the legacy.

It is located from the centre of Paris. In 2012, Colombes was the 53rd largest city in France. Name The name Colombes comes from Latin columna (Old French colombe), meaning \\"column\\". This is interpreted as referring either to a megalithic column used in ancient times by a druidic cult which stood in Colombes until its destruction during the French Revolution, or to the columns of an atrium in a ruined Gallo-Roman villa that also stood in Colombes. History On 13 March 1896, 17% of the territory of Colombes was detached and became the commune of Bois-Colombes (literally \\"Colombes Woods\\"). On 2 May 1910, 19% of the (reduced) territory of Colombes was detached and became the commune of La Garenne-Colombes. Thus, the commune of Colombes is now only two- thirds the size of its territory before 1896.

Early life Kaye was born in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, the only child of Harold and Gracie Kaye; Gracie was 42 when she gave birth. Harold Kaye was a lorry driver in the ARP during the Second World War, and at other times worked as an engineer in a tractor factory. When young, Kaye played rugby league for Moldgreen ARLFC before studying at King James's Grammar School, Almondbury, Huddersfield. He worked in hospital radio in Huddersfield (interviewing the Beatles in 1965), and worked in textile mills, a wine factory, and a tractor factory. Career Kaye in London, 1974 Kaye had appeared in a radio play directed by Alan Ayckbourn and also in a television play from Manchester. Ayckbourn suggested that he audition for the Bolton Octagon Theatre; he was offered a contract and his roles there included Pishchik in The Cherry Orchard followed by roles in The Homecoming, The Imaginary Invalid, Luther, and a double-bill of Oedipus and Cyclops. He made his TV debut as a railway guard in the BBC's Yorkshire mill drama Champion House (1968) and played small roles in such films as The Party's Over (1965), starring Oliver Reed. Having been seen by Pat Phoenix in Little Malcolm by David Halliwell at Bolton, he was cast as Bernard Butler, the nephew of Elsie Tanner (Phoenix), in the soap opera Coronation Street in 1969.

Also in 1984 he appeared as hard man Sammy, an enforcer employed by agoraphobic bookmaker Albert Wendle in the Minder episode \\"Get Daley!\\" In 1990, Kaye played the fictional local television presenter Maynard Lavery in an edition of Last of the Summer Wine. In the early 1990s he made a guest appearance in a Christmas special of Family Fortunes, in which he served as team captain and placed host Les Dennis on a special \\"Double Big Money\\" round for Dennis to score more than one hundred points to double the charity prize money, which he did. ='Allo 'Allo!= In 1982, David Croft sent Kaye the script for the pilot episode of 'Allo 'Allo! inviting him to play the central character of Ren√© Artois. He accepted and appeared in all 84 episodes (the main series ran from 1984, two years after the pilot, until 1992) and 1,200 performances of the stage version. Kaye was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1986 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the curtain call of the West End stage version of 'Allo 'Allo! at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Kaye returned as Rene Artois in a 2007 one-off television revival of 'Allo 'Allo! and in a stage show in Brisbane, Australia, at the Twelfth Night Theatre in June and July, alongside Sue Hodge as Mimi Labonq and Guy Siner as Lieutenant Gruber. The other characters were portrayed by Australian actors, including Katy Manning, Steven Tandy, Chloe Dallimore, and Jason Gann. Personal life Kaye's autobiography, Ren√© and Me: An Autobiography (co- written with Hilary Bonner), was published in 1989. In the book, he described his experiences as a shy, gay, overweight, typecast youth.Ren√© and Me: An Autobiography (with Hilary Bonner). Pan Books, London, Sydney, Auckland, 1990, ), p. 102. The unusual spelling of his name (usually spelt \\"Gordon\\") was the result of a British Actors' Equity Association typing error. Kaye suffered serious head injuries in a car accident whilst driving his Honda CRX, during the Burns' Day storm on 25 January 1990.\\"On This Day: 25 January 1990\\" ‚Äì BBC Online Although he could not remember any details of the incident, he retained a scar on his forehead from a piece of wooden advertising hoarding that had smashed through the car windscreen. Writing in his memoirs, Allo 'Allo! co- writer Jeremy Lloyd said he visited Kaye in hospital, adding, \\"I believe part of his recovery was due to his agent getting a video and showing reruns of Allo 'Allo! to remind him who he was.\\" While recovering in hospital from emergency brain surgery to treat injuries sustained in the accident, Kaye was photographed and interviewed by Sunday Sport journalist Roger Ordish. He sued the newspaper, but the Court of Appeal held, in Kaye v Robertson, that there was no remedy in English law for an invasion of privacy. Death Kaye suffered from dementia and spent the last two years of his life in a care home in Knaresborough, where he died, on 23 January 2017, at the age of 75. His funeral was held at Huddersfield Parish Church on 17 February. His co-stars from 'Allo 'Allo! Vicki Michelle, Sue Hodge, and Kim Hartman attended, as did Ken Morley, also from Coronation Street, who gave a tribute. The unofficial Yorkshire anthem \\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\\" was sung at the service.

He appeared in more than 60 films and won two AFI Awards. He was also a recipient of the Centenary Medal. Early life Hunter was born in Ballarat, Victoria, the son of William and Francie Hunter. He had a brother, John, and a sister, Marie Ann. During his teens, Hunter was a champion swimmer, and briefly held a world record for the 100 yards freestyle until his record was broken by John Devitt in the very next heat ten minutes later.Atterton, Margot; Alan Veitch: The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Australian Showbiz (1984). Hunter qualified for the Australian swimming team for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia before a bout of meningitis ended his Olympic hopes.Bill Hunter gravely ill with inoperable cancer, Herald Sun, 19 May 2011. Career Hunter made his film debut as an extra in 1957 film The Shiralee. An introduction to Ava Gardner saw him gain a job as an extra and swimming double in the Hollywood film On the Beach, which was filming in Melbourne. Hunter claimed that he was inspired to take up acting after watching one of the leads (variously claimed to be either Gregory Peck or Fred Astaire) do 27 takes of a scene, and thinking he could do better.Bill Hunter faces the final curtain, Herald Sun, 19 May 2011.Bodey, Michael: Charismatic wild man of cinema, The Australian, 23 May 2011. He took an intensive drama course in Melbourne and sailed aboard the RHMS Ellinis on New Year's Eve 1964 for England. There he won a two-year scholarship to the prestigious Northampton Repertory Company in England. In 1966, Hunter made his first television appearance, two episodes in The Ark, a serial within the third season of the BBC television drama series Doctor Who.Muriel's Wedding star Bill Hunter 'gravely ill' , ninemsn, 18 May 2011.Production notes , The Ark DVD, BBC. Hunter returned to Australia in 1967 and began working in television drama and feature films. He had interviewed with Gavrik Losey in London making no great impression in that highly competitive atmosphere but Losey was able to offer Hunter his first Australian film appearance in Ned Kelly when it came into being in Australia with Losey as production supervisor. Hunter often played characters who were the strong, opinionated, archetypal gruff Australian whose exterior belies a softer heart and sensibilities vulnerable to pressure. Some of his most notable movie roles include Mad Dog Morgan (1976), Newsfront (1978), Gallipoli (1981), The Dismissal, Scales of Justice (1983), Strictly Ballroom (1992), Muriel's Wedding (1994), The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) and Australia (2008). In 2007, he reprised the role of Bob in the Australian touring stage production of Priscilla. He also provided the voice of the dentist in Finding Nemo (2003) and the voice of Bubo in Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (2010). He portrayed United Nations Secretary General Spencer Chartwell in the American science fiction series Space: Above and Beyond. His last film role was in The Cup (2011). Of acting, Hunter said, \\"As long as the director told me where to stand and what to say, I was happy. Anyone who says there's any more to it than that, is full of bullshit. ... It's a job. It is a craft, but there's no art involved. What you need is common sense and a reasonably rough head. You put on the makeup and the wardrobe, and that is half the performance. That upsets the purists, but never mind, they don't work as much as I do.\\"Bill Hunter, 71, voiced the dentist in Finding Nemo . blog.bcdb.com, 23 May 2011 Personal life and death Hunter's first marriage was to Robbie Anderson from 1963 to 1973, with whom he had a son, named James Hunter. His next marriage was to actress Pat Bishop, in 1976. According to writer Bob Ellis, the marriage was short-lived after Hunter ran off with their marriage celebrant.Ellis, Bob: \\"I don't do auditions, mate\\": remembering Bill Hunter , ABC The Drum Unleashed, 23 May 2011. His third marriage was to artist and television presenter Rhoda Roberts, from 1993 until their divorce in 1999.Queen of arts , The Sun-Herald, 17 November 2003.

It derives from large feather-legged chickens brought from China to Europe and North America in the 1840s and 1850s. It is reared principally for exhibition. It was formerly known as Cochin-China. History Like the Brahma, the Cochin derives from very large feather-legged chickens brought from China to Europe and North America in the 1840s and 1850s. These were at first known as \\"Shanghai\\" birds, and later as \\"Cochin-Chinas\\". The large size and striking appearance of these birds contributed to a sudden large increase of interest in poultry-breeding in Western countries, sometimes described as \\"hen fever\\". The Cochin was included in the first edition of the Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry, prepared by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier for the first Poultry Club of Great Britain in 1865. The colours described are buff, black, cinnamon, grouse, lemon, partridge, silver buff, silver cinnamon, and white. Bantam Cochins were not listed. The Cochin, both full-sized and bantam, was included in the first edition of the Standard of Excellence of the American Poultry Association in 1874. The original colours were white, partridge, buff and black; other colours were later added.  Characteristics  The most distinctive feature of the Cochin is the excessive plumage that covers leg and foot. The skin beneath the feathers is yellow. In the United Kingdom the recognised colour varieties, for large fowl only, are black, blue, buff, cuckoo, partridge and grouse, and white; Cochin bantams are not recognised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain. The Entente Europ√©enne lists the same nine colours for full-sized Cochins, and twenty-four for the bantam; any of the bantam varieties may be frizzled, with the feathers curling outwards. The American Poultry Association recognises nine colours for the full-sized bird ‚Äì barred, black, blue, brown, buff, golden-laced, partridge, silver-laced, and white; the same colours are recognised for the bantam, with the addition of four more: birchen, Columbian, mottled, and red.  Use  The Cochin has been bred principally for exhibition, at the expense of productive characteristics. It is a good layer of very large tinted eggs, and lays well in winter. The hens are good sitters and good mothers, and may be used to hatch the eggs of turkeys and ducks. The meat tends to be coarse in texture and excessively dark; capons slaughtered at an age of 12‚Äì16 months provide a good large table bird.

Kennedy. It is noted for its controversial subject matter, and was released November 22, 2004 (the 41st anniversary of the event) by Scotland-based Traffic Games. The game's developers insisted their intentions were to \\"bring history to life\\", and help prove the Warren Commission's findings. Gameplay JFK Reloaded puts the player in the role of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was found by five U.S. government investigations to have been Kennedy's assassin.These were investigations by: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1963), the Warren Commission (1964), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979), the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. The player is then scored on how closely their version of the assassination matches the report of the Warren Commission (first shot missed, second hit JFK and Governor Connally and third hits JFK's head and kills him). According to the company, the primary aim of the game was \\"to establish the most likely facts of what happened on 1963-11-22 by running the world's first mass-participation forensic construction\\", the theory being that a player could help prove that Lee Harvey Oswald had the \\"means and the opportunity to commit the crime\\", and thus help prove the Warren Commission's finding. Players were able to submit scores, rating how close their version of events were to the Warren Commission's, for a competition that ended on February 22, 2005. The competition promised winnings of \\"up to\\" $100,000, but the final prize was just $10,712. Afterwards, the competition option was disabled and the cost of the simulator was reduced to $4.99. It was later offered for free download before the official website closed in August 2005. The game starts just before JFK's limousine comes into view‚Äîabout 28 seconds before the first shot was fired according to Warren et al. The player aims and fires with the mouse, and is free to fire immediately, but points are only given for the first three shots; all others subtract points. Ammunition is limited to 39 rounds. Oswald's rifle only contained four live rounds ‚Äì three were fired and the fourth was in the chamber ready to fire. Three empty brass cartridges were found near the sixth floor window of the Texas School Book Depository. The game ends when the limo disappears into the tunnel or a certain amount of time has passed from the beginning of the game. The player can also end the simulation at any by pressing the spacebar. = Replay and ballistics = The characters of the game are called \\"actors\\". After the first shots that hit someone are fired, Secret Service agent Clint Hill runs behind the limo, which then slows down. If the player is able to fire the third shot and hit Kennedy in the head, Jackie Kennedy climbs onto the trunk and then goes back in. The limo speeds up either after Hill jumps on the running board or four seconds pass since slowing down. The original game software had severely unrealistic ballistics which caused bullet drop in the game to be exaggerated compared to the actual ballistics of 6.5 x 52 mm ammo fired through a Carcano Model 91/38 rifle, which was used to kill JFK. A modified version of the game allows correction for this mistake in the original program and also adds shooter positions at the \\"grassy knoll\\" and the Dal-Tex building in Dealey Plaza. Players can then view a replay of their attempts from additional angles. There are twelve different angles for the camera, including \\"bullet-camera\\" and freely moved camera. After that, ballistics of the shots fired at the limo are shown, including their flypaths. Statistics of the game can be stored. A maximum of 1000 points can be scored. In the competition, the final highest registered score was 782 out of 1000. Critical reaction JFK Reloaded was condemned by the late Senator Ted Kennedy, the late President Kennedy's brother, as \\"despicable\\"; and by Sen. Joseph Lieberman who \\"was sickened by the game.\\" Children NOW, an organization that promotes safer media for children, dismissed Traffic Media's claims that JFK Reloaded has educational merit. Director Christy Glaubke commented \\"I would think the only [lesson it teaches] is how to be an assassin.\\" The game, however, is explicitly not intended for children. On Metacritic, the game achieved a score of 69/100, with some critics noting that \\"the simulation, viewed on its own, is quite compelling\\", but that this was impeded by the lack of \\"taste\\" in approaching the subject matter, while others said the matter was taken \\"seriously\\", and others praising the accuracy of the simulation and the enjoyability of the gameplay detached from the subject matter. Kirk Ewing, Traffic Software's Managing Director, said \\"We genuinely believe that, if we get enough people participating, we'll be able to disprove, once and for all, any notion that someone else was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.\\" In popular culture In \\"Raw\\", a 2005 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, \\"BlitzkriegKids.com\\", the website of a teenage neo-Nazi, has a link to the game. This catches the eye of Detective Munch, a devoted Kennedy admirer who believes many of the conspiracy theories surrounding his assassination. He asks, \\"What the hell is 'JFK Reloaded'?\\", at which point Fin assures his partner that it is not something he wants to see.

Frequency multipliers consist of a nonlinear circuit that distorts the input signal and consequently generates harmonics of the input signal. A subsequent bandpass filter selects the desired harmonic frequency and removes the unwanted fundamental and other harmonics from the output. Frequency multipliers are often used in frequency synthesizers and communications circuits. It can be more economical to develop a lower frequency signal with lower power and less expensive devices, and then use a frequency multiplier chain to generate an output frequency in the microwave or millimeter wave range. Some modulation schemes, such as frequency modulation, survive the nonlinear distortion without ill effect (but schemes such as amplitude modulation do not). Frequency multiplication is also used in nonlinear optics. The nonlinear distortion in crystals can be used to generate harmonics of laser light. Theory A pure sine wave has a single frequency f :x(t) = Asin(2 pi ft), If the sine wave is applied to a linear circuit, such as a distortionless amplifier, the output is still a sine wave (but may acquire a phase shift). However, if the sine wave is applied to a nonlinear circuit, the resulting distortion creates harmonics; frequency components at integer multiples nf of the fundamental frequency f. The distorted signal can be described by a Fourier series in f. :x(t) = sum_{k=-infty}^{infty} c_k e^{j 2 pi k f t}. The nonzero ck represent the generated harmonics. The Fourier coefficients are given by integrating over the fundamental period T: :c_k = frac{1}{2pi}int_{0}^{T} x(t) , e^{-j 2 pi k t / T}, dt So a frequency multiplier can be built from a nonlinear electronic component which generates a series of harmonics, followed by a bandpass filter which passes one of the harmonics to the output and blocks the others. From a conversion efficiency standpoint, the nonlinear circuit should maximize the coefficient for the desired harmonic and minimize the others. Consequently, the transcribing function is often specially chosen. Easy choices are to use an even function to generate even harmonics or an odd function for odd harmonics. See Even and odd functions#Harmonics. A full wave rectifier, for example, is good for making a doubler. To produce a times-3 multiplier, the original signal may be input to an amplifier that is over driven to produce nearly a square wave. This signal is high in 3rd order harmonics and can be filtered to produce the desired x3 outcome. YIG multipliers often want to select an arbitrary harmonic, so they use a stateful distortion circuit that converts the input sine wave into an approximate impulse train. The ideal (but impractical) impulse train generates an infinite number of (weak) harmonics. In practice, an impulse train generated by a monostable circuit will have many usable harmonics. YIG multipliers using step recovery diodes may, for example, take an input frequency of 1 to 2 GHz and produce outputs up to 18 GHz.For example, the old Hewlett Packard 83590A. Sometimes the frequency multiplier circuit will adjust the width of the impulses to improve conversion efficiency for a specific harmonic. Circuits =Diode= Clipping circuits. Full wave bridge doubler. =Class C amplifier and multiplier= Efficiently generating power becomes more important at high power levels. Linear Class A amplifiers are at best 25 percent efficient. Push-pull Class B amplifiers are at best 50 percent efficient. The basic problem is the amplifying element is dissipating power. Switching Class C amplifiers are nonlinear, but they can be better than 50 percent efficient because an ideal switch does not dissipate any power. A clever design can use the nonlinear Class C amplifier for both gain and as a frequency multiplier. =Step recovery diode= Generating a large number of useful harmonics requires a fast nonlinear device. Step recovery diodes. Microwave generators may use a step recovery diode impulse generator followed by a tunable YIG filter. The YIG filter has a yttrium iron garnet sphere that is tuned with a magnetic field. The step recovery diode impulse generator is driven at a subharmonic of the desired output frequency. An electromagnet then tunes the YIG filter to select the desired harmonic. =Varactor diode= Resistive loaded varactors. Regenerative varactors. Penfield. Frequency multipliers have much in common with frequency mixers, and some of the same nonlinear devices are used for both: transistors operated in Class C and diodes. In transmitting circuits many of the amplifying devices (vacuum tubes or transistors) operate nonlinearly and create harmonics, so an amplifier stage can be made a multiplier by tuning the tuned circuit at the output to a multiple of the input frequency. Usually the power (gain) produced by the nonlinear device drops off rapidly at the higher harmonics, so most frequency multipliers just double or triple the frequency, and multiplication by higher factors is accomplished by cascading doubler and tripler stages. =Previous uses= Frequency multipliers use circuits tuned to a harmonic of the input frequency. Non-linear elements such as diodes may be added to enhance the production of harmonic frequencies. Since the power in the harmonics declines rapidly, usually a frequency multiplier is tuned to only a small multiple (twice, three times, or five times) of the input frequency. Usually amplifiers are inserted in a chain of frequency multipliers to ensure adequate signal level at the final frequency. Since the tuned circuits have a limited bandwidth, if the base frequency is changed significantly (more than one percent or so), the multiplier stages may have to be adjusted; this can take significant time if there are many stages. =Microelectromechanical (MEMS) frequency doubler= An electric-field driven micromechanical cantilever resonator is one of the most fundamental and widely studied structures in MEMS, which can provide a high Q and narrow bandpass filtering function. The inherent square-law nonlinearity of the voltage-to-force transfer function of a cantilever resonator's capacitive transducer can be employed for the realization of frequency doubling effect.Microelectromechanical system cantilever-based frequency doublers Due to the low-loss attribute (or equivalently, a high Q) offered by MEMS devices, improved circuit performance can be expected from a micromechanical frequency doubler than semiconductor devices utilized for the same task.1.156-GHz self-aligned vibrating micromechanical disk resonator =Graphene based frequency multipliers= Graphene based FETs have also been employed for frequency doubling with more than 90% converting efficiency. In fact, all ambipolar transistors can be used for designing frequency multiplier circuits.Scalable Fabrication of Ambipolar Transistors and Radio‚ÄêFrequency Circuits Using Aligned Carbon Nanotube Arrays Graphene can work over a large frequency range due to its unique characteristics.A frequency multiplier using three ambipolar graphene transistors Phase-locked loops with frequency dividers A phase-locked loop (PLL) uses a reference frequency to generate a multiple of that frequency. A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is initially tuned roughly to the range of the desired frequency multiple. The signal from the VCO is divided down using frequency dividers by the multiplication factor. The divided signal and the reference frequency are fed into a phase comparator. The output of the phase comparator is a voltage that is proportional to the phase difference. After passing through a low pass filter and being converted to the proper voltage range, this voltage is fed to the VCO to adjust the frequency. This adjustment increases the frequency as the phase of the VCO's signal lags that of the reference signal and decreases the frequency as the lag decreases (or lead increases). The VCO will stabilize at the desired frequency multiple. This type of PLL is a type of frequency synthesizer. =Fractional-N synthesizer= In some PLLs the reference frequency may also be divided by an integer multiple before being input to the phase comparator. This allows the synthesis of frequencies that are N/M times the reference frequency. This can be accomplished in a different manner by periodically changing the integer value of an integer-N frequency divider, effectively resulting in a multiplier with both whole number and fractional component. Such a multiplier is called a fractional-N synthesizer after its fractional component. Fractional-N synthesizers provide an effective means of achieving fine frequency resolution with lower values of N, allowing loop architectures with tens of thousands of times less phase noise than alternative designs with lower reference frequencies and higher integer N values. They also allow a faster settling time because of their higher reference frequencies, allowing wider closed and open loop bandwidths. Delta sigma synthesizer A delta sigma synthesizer adds a randomization to programmable-N frequency divider of the fractional-N synthesizer. This is done to shrink sidebands created by periodic changes of an integer-N frequency divider. =PLL References= * Egan, William F. 2000.

A widow's walk, also known as a widow's watch or roofwalk, is a railed rooftop platform often with a small enclosed cupola frequently found on 19th-century North American coastal houses. The name is said to come from the wives of mariners, who would watch for their spouses' return, often in vain as the ocean took the lives of the mariners, leaving the women widows.Elizabeth Pacey and Alvin Comiter, Landmarks: Historic Buildings of Nova Scotia, Nimbus Publishing (1994), p. 167 In other coastal communities, the platforms were called Captain's Walk, as they topped the homes of the more successful captains; supposedly, ship owners and captains would use them to search the horizon for ships due in port. However, there is little or no evidence that widow's walks were intended or regularly used to observe shipping. Widow's walks are in fact a standard decorative feature of Italianate architecture, which was very popular during the height of the Age of Sail in many North American coastal communities. The widow's walk is a variation of the Italianate cupola.\\"Italianate Architecture\\", Humanities Index The Italianate cupola, also known as a \\"belvedere\\", was an important ornate finish to this style, although it was often high maintenance and prone to leaks.Stewart Brand, How Buildings Learn Viking Press (1994) p. 124 Beyond their use as viewing platforms, they are frequently built around the chimney of the residence, thus creating access to the structure.

Early life and education M√ºller was born on January 12, 1899 in Olten, Solothurn to Gottlieb and Fanny (n√©e Leypoldt or Leypold ) M√ºller. He was the oldest of four children. His father worked for the Swiss Federal Railways and the family first moved to Lenzburg in Aargau and then to Basel. M√ºller went to the \\"Freie Evangelische Volksschule\\" (free Protestant peoples school) and later to the lower and upper \\"Realschule\\". In that time, he had a small laboratory where he could develop photographic plates or build radio equipment. In 1916 he left school to work as a laboratory assistant at Dreyfus (or Dreyfuss & Cie) and Company; the next year he became an assistant chemist in the Scientific- Industrial Laboratory of the electrical plant of Lonza A.G. Returning to school in 1918, he obtained his diploma by 1919 and entered Basel University in the same year. At Basel University he studied chemistry (with a minor in botany and physics) and started to study inorganic chemistry under professor Friedrich Fichter. In 1922 he continued his studies in the organic chemistry lab of Hans Rupe. While working for Rupe as assistant, he received his PhD writing a dissertation entitled Die chemische und elektrochemische Oxidation des as. m-Xylidins und seines Mono- und Di-Methylderivates (The Chemical and Electrochemical Oxidation of Asymmetrical m-Xylidene and its Mono- and Di- methyl Derivatives) in 1925. He graduated summa cum laude. Early work at Geigy On 25 May 1925 M√ºller began working as a research chemist for the dye division of J. R. Geigy AG in Basel. His first research topics at Geigy concerned synthetic and plant-derived dyes and natural tanning agents. This work led to the production of the synthetic tanning agents Irgatan G, Irgatan FL and Irgatan FLT. In 1935, Geigy began research on moth- and plant- protection agents and M√ºller was specifically interested in plant protection. He said that his love for plants and nature in general, which led him to choose botany as a minor subject at university, brought him to think about plant protection. Specifically, he wanted to start synthesizing chemical plant protection agents himself. In 1937, he patented a technique for synthesizing novel rhodanide- and cyanate-based compounds which showed bactericide and insecticide activity. He then developed the product Graminone, a seed disinfectant which was safer than the mercury-based disinfectants at the time. Synthesis of DDT After his success with tanning agents and disinfectants, M√ºller was assigned to develop an insecticide. \\"At that time,\\" according to The World of Anatomy and Physiology, \\"the only available insecticides were either expensive natural products or synthetics ineffective against insects; the only compounds that were both effective and inexpensive were arsenic compounds, which were just as poisonous to human beings and other mammals.\\" During the course of his research, M√ºller found that insects absorbed chemicals differently than mammals. This led him to believe it likely that there are chemicals toxic exclusively to insects. He sought to \\"synthesize the ideal contact insecticide‚Äîone which would have a quick and powerful toxic effect upon the largest possible number of insect species while causing little or no harm to plants and warm-blooded animals.\\" He also made it his goal to create an insecticide that was long-lasting and cheap to produce, along with a high degree of chemical stability. In embracing this goal, M√ºller was motivated by two events. The first of these was a major food shortage in Switzerland, which underscored the need for a better way to control the infestation of crops by insects. The second was the typhus epidemic in Russia, which was the most extensive and lethal such epidemic in history. He began his search for his insecticide in 1935. He studied all the data he could find on the subject of insecticides, decided which chemical properties the kind of insecticide he was in search of would exhibit, and set out to find a compound that would suit his purposes. M√ºller spent four years searching and failed 349 times before, in September 1939, he found the compound he was looking for. He placed a fly in a cage laced with one particular compound, and short while later, the fly died. The compound he had placed in the cage was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), or, more precisely, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane, which a Viennese pharmacologist named Othmar Zeidler had first synthesized in 1874. Zeidler, while publishing a paper about his synthesis, had not investigated the properties of the new compound, and had thus failed to recognize its extraordinary value as an insecticide. M√ºller quickly realized that DDT was the chemical he had been searching for. Tests of DDT by the Swiss government and the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed its effectiveness against the Colorado potato beetle. Further tests demonstrated its astonishing effectiveness against a wide range of pests, including the mosquito, louse, flea, and sandfly, which, respectively, spread malaria, typhus, the plague, and various tropical diseases. Application of DDT After taking out a Swiss patent on DDT in 1940 (a U.K. patent followed in 1942 and patents in the U.S. and Australia in 1943), Geigy began to market two DDT-based products, a 5% dust called Gesarol spray insecticide and a 3% dust called Neocid dust insecticide. The name DDT was first employed by the British Ministry of Supply in 1943, and the product was added to U.S. Army supply lists in May of the same year. It was also in 1943 that the first practical tests of DDT as a residual insecticide against adult vector mosquitoes were carried out. The next year, in Italy, tests were performed in which residual DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings of a community to test its effect on Anopheles vectors and malaria incidence. DDT saved the lives of millions during World War II. Between the 1950s and 1970s, DDT helped eradicate malaria entirely from many countries, the U.S. included. Later scientific career M√ºller became Geigy's Deputy Director of Scientific Research on Substances for Plant Protection in 1946. In 1948 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, \\"for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods.\\" The fact that he was accorded this honour even though he was neither a physician nor a medical researcher reflected the immense impact that DDT had had in the fight against human disease. The Nobel Committee said: \\"DDT has been used in large quantities in the evacuation of concentration camps, of prisons and deportees. Without any doubt, the material has already preserved the life and health of hundreds of thousands.\\" In 1951, M√ºller was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the 1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. In addition to the 1948 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, M√ºller received an honorary doctorate from the University of Thessalonica in Greece in recognition of DDT's impact on the Mediterranean region. He retired from Geigy in 1961, continuing his research in a home laboratory. Personal life In high school, M√ºller was only an average student. His grades suffered because he spent all his free time in his little home laboratory performing elementary experiments. In high school and college, M√ºller was often mocked by his peers being called, \\"The Ghost,\\" due to his thin and pale appearance. M√ºller married Friedel R√ºegsegger in 1927 and had two sons, Heinrich (b. 1929) and Niklaus (b. 1933), and one daughter, Margaretha (b. 1934).

His wife took charge of the household and raised their two sons and daughter so that M√ºller could concentrate on chemistry. In his free time, M√ºller enjoyed the nature in the Swiss Alps and in the Swiss Jura where he owned a small holiday home, allowing him to resume his longtime interest in botany. Furthermore, he owned a small fruit farm that he regularly tended to. M√ºller often relaxed while gardening, photographing mountain wildflowers, and taking the children on early morning nature walks. Moreover, M√ºller and his wife often enjoyed playing flute and piano duets from Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. Reading on the weekends in the mountains, M√ºller immersed himself in the science of plant protection and pest control. This fascination resulted in his research on pesticides at Geigy, and sequentially the discovery of DDT's pesticidal properties. M√ºller was regarded as independent, a lone wolf. His daughter, Margaretha, called him an Eigenbr√∂tler: one \\"who makes his own bread\\". He was determined and persistent in all aspects of his life, having learned a great deal from his college mentor Fichter. McGrayne, S. B. Prometheans in the lab: chemistry and the making of the modern world; McGraw- Hill: New York, 2002; p 148-162 M√ºller died in the early morning of October 13, 1965, in Basel, after a short illness, surrounded by family. Honors M√ºller received many honors in his life, among them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Specifically Greece honored him for the near elimination of malaria in the country as a result of his discovery. In 1963, he was invited to Greece and received with great sympathy and celebrated as national hero. * Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1948 * Honorary member of the \\"Swiss Nature Research Society\\" 1949 * Honorary member of the \\"Paris Society of Industrial Chemistry\\" 1949 * Honorary member of the \\"Reale Accademia Internazionale del Parnaso (Napoli)\\" 1951 * Medal of Honour of the \\"Congr√®s Internationale de Phytopharmacie et Phytiatrie (Paris)\\" 1952 * Honorary member of the \\"Academia Brasileira de Medicina Militar (Rio de Janeiro)\\" 1954 * Honorary doctorate at the Universidad Nacional Eva Per√≥n * Honorary professorship at the \\"Escuela Superior Tecnica e Investigacion Cientifica (Buenos Aires)\\" * Honorary doctorate at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki 1963 * Golden medal of the city of Thessaloniki 1963 Publications    References External links  including the Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1948 Dichloro- Diphenyl-Trichloroethane and Newer Insecticides 1899 births 1965 deaths Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine People from the canton of Solothurn Swiss chemists Swiss Nobel laureates ","title":"Paul Hermann M√ºller"},{"id":"1199473","text":"The Blastolene Special, also known as the \\"Tank Car\\", is a unique, specially built car, designed and built by American master craftsman Randy Grubb.

Personally named Li Yi, later renamed Li Chen (), and known before his reign as the Prince of Guang, he was considered the last capable emperor of Tang China. Succeeding emperors after Xuanzong would either be too young or be dominated by eunuchs or warlords. Emperor Xuanzong was the 13th son of Emperor Xianzong (r. 806‚Äì820) and an uncle of the previous three emperors, Emperor Jingzong, Emperor Wenzong, and Emperor Wuzong. To distinguish Emperor Xuanzong from his ancestor Emperor Xu√°nzong (personal name Li Longji), as their temple names are rendered identically in Wade‚ÄìGiles and when pinyin tonal marks are not used, Xuanzong is occasionally referred to as Xuanzong II in western sources; in Chinese, however, their temple names (ÂÆ£ÂÆó for him and ÁéÑÂÆó for Li Longji) are clearly distinct and this device is not used.  Background  Li Yi was born in 810, at Daming Palace (), as the 13th of 20 known sons of then-reigning Emperor Xianzong.Old Book of Tang, vol. 175. His mother was Emperor Xianzong's concubine Consort Zheng, who had previously been a concubine of the warlord Li Qi and who, after imperial forces defeated Li Qi in 807, was taken into Emperor Xianzong's palace to be a servant girl to Emperor Xianzong's wife Consort Guo, but who at some point bore Li Yi for Emperor Xianzong. Consort Zheng is not known to have borne any other children for Emperor Xianzong.New Book of Tang, vol. 77. After Emperor Xianzong died in 820, Li Yi's older brother Li Heng, born of Consort Guo, became emperor (as Emperor Muzong), and in 821, when Emperor Muzong created a number of his sons and brothers to be imperial princes, Li Yi was created the Prince of Guang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241.  As imperial prince  In Li Yi's youth, he was said to be shy and a poor speaker, and (falsely) considered by others to be unintelligent. Later, during the reigns of Emperor Muzong's sons Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Wuzong, Li Yi was said to try to hide himself from the political scene, and rarely spoke anything at all. When the emperors visited the imperial princes' residences, known as the Sixteen Mansions, they would, as a game, try to get Li Yi to speak, and they referred to him as \\"Uncle Guang.\\" It was said that Emperor Wuzong, who had an outgoing personality, particularly disrespected Li Yi. In early 846, Emperor Wuzong became extremely ill and was unable to speak. The palace eunuchs gathered and decided on Li Yi as Emperor Wuzong's successor, probably because they considered him simple- minded and therefore easier to control. They had an edict issued in Emperor Wuzong's name creating Li Yi crown prince and changing his name to Li Chen and putting him in charge of the imperial affairs. It was said that only when Li Chen met the officials in his role as crown prince that his appropriate expressions of sadness and actions on pending matters caused people to begin to see that he was truly intelligent. Soon thereafter, Emperor Wuzong died, and Li Chen took the throne (as Emperor Xuanzong).  Early reign  Emperor Xuanzong honored his mother Consort Zheng as empress dowager. Immediately after taking the throne, Emperor Xuanzong acted against the powerful chancellor Li Deyu, who had dominated the court during Emperor Wuzong's reign, as he despised Li Deyu for monopolizing power. Emperor Xuanzong removed Li Deyu from his chancellor position and sent him out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and also removed Li Deyu's fellow chancellor Zheng Su. Over the next few years, Emperor Xuanzong purged those officials he considered sympathetic to Li Deyu, and further pursued charges against Li Deyu based on Li Deyu having executed the minor official Wu Xiang () on charges that should not have warranted death (Li Deyu was resentful of Wu Xiang's uncle Wu Wuling ()). Li Deyu was repeatedly demoted and sent farther and farther away from Chang'an, eventually dying in exile around the new year 850 in Yai Prefecture (Â¥ñÂ∑û, in modern Haikou, Hainan). These actions were considered to have largely ended the factionalism among imperial officials known as the Niu‚ÄìLi factional strife, which had plagued the imperial government ever since the reign of Emperor Muzong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 60 [847]. A number of policies that Emperor Wuzong and Li Deyu had pursued, including persecution against Buddhism and alliance with the Yenisei Kirghiz, were reversed. In Li Deyu's place, Emperor Xuanzong installed Bai Minzhong as the leading chancellor, and over the next few years, Bai recommended a number of other officials, including fellow chancellor Ma Zhi. Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong also turned his attention to the Tibetan Empire, which had fallen into intense civil war after the death of its king Langdarma in 842.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. Starting in 848, and over a period of several years, Emperor Xuanzong commissioned border troops to recapture various prefectures lost to the Tibetan Empire since the An Lushan Rebellion, taking the region constituting modern eastern Gansu, southern Ningxia, and western Sichuan. Further, after the ethnic Han Chinese Zhang Yichao seized control of the Hexi Corridor from Tibetan officials and submitted to Emperor Xuanzong in 851, Tang had largely reversed the losses to the Tibetan Empire.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 60 [848‚Äì850]. However, he initially had little success with rebellions by the Tanguts. After he came to realize that the Tanguts were repeatedly rebelling because of mistreatment by Tang officials, he modified the policies to install officials who were known for mild temper and honesty in the Tangut regions, and he further put Bai in charge of the operations against the Tanguts, giving him a large staff that included many well-known imperial government officials. With Bai overseeing the operations, the Tanguts largely submitted in 851. Bai, however, was not returned to chancellorship within Emperor Xuanzong's lifetime, and was effectively replaced by Linghu Tao. Emperor Xuanzong was said to govern diligently, paying much attention to how his capable ancestor Emperor Taizong ruled and trying to follow Emperor Taizong's examples. He also took the time and effort to familiarize himself with imperial officials' capabilities, as well as the customs of the various prefectures throughout the realm, such that he could properly commission officials based on their abilities and review whether they were governing capably. He also encouraged frugality, and tried to demonstrate it by reducing the expenditures for the wedding of his favorite daughter Princess Wanshou to the imperial official Zheng Hao (). It was said that throughout his reign, the imperial clan members and their relatives all carefully obeyed laws. In 848, Emperor Muzong's mother Grand Empress Dowager Guo‚Äîwhom Empress Dowager Zheng had previously been a servant for‚Äîdied. Traditional historians noted that popular perception at the time was that Emperor Xuanzong might have murdered her. (It had said that she was depressed over Emperor Xuanzong's disrespect toward her, because Empress Dowager Zheng had resented her, and also because he suspected her and Emperor Muzong of having instigated the death of Emperor Xianzong at the hands of the eunuch Chen Hongzhi ().) Initially, he would refuse to allow Grand Empress Dowager Guo to be buried with Emperor Xianzong or to be enshrined in Emperor Xianzong's temple, but eventually allowed her to be buried with Emperor Xianzong. (He would still refuse to enshrine her, however, with Emperor Xianzong, during his lifetime.)  Late reign  Zhenling (Ë≤ûÈôµ), the tomb of Emperor Xuanzong, in Jingyang County, Shaanxi One of the major themes later in Emperor Xuanzong's reign was the high-level officials' concerns that he was not creating a Crown Prince, as this refusal to do so left the imperial succession uncertain. The issue was raised repeatedly, including by chancellors Wei Mo, Pei Xiu, and Cui Shenyou, but he rebuffed all of them, leading to Pei's resignation and Cui's removal. (The reason why Emperor Xuanzong repeatedly refused to create a crown prince was said to be his disfavor for his oldest son Li Wen the Prince of Yun and favor for his third son Li Zi the Prince of Kui. He wanted Li Zi to be his heir, but was hesitant to create Li Zi crown prince because Li Zi was not the oldest.) Emperor Xuanzong was said to be careful in promoting and rewarding officials, such that it was not often that he rewarded officials with the highly honorable red and purple uniforms, and was also said to be fair in his promotions such that he did not unjustly favor those who were close to him. Further, he punished those who were close to him when they deserved to be punished, and did not spare them on account of their closeness to him. In order to make sure that the prefects that he commissioned were suitable for the prefectures, he required that they report to Chang'an to meet with him before heading to their posts. It was also said that he was stern, even with the chancellors, such that even though Linghu Tao was chancellor for 10 years, he continued to fear the emperor. Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong also considered curbing the eunuchs' power, but could not think of a good way of doing so. On one occasion, when he conferred with the imperial scholar Wei Ao (), Wei told him that he was already the emperor who had exerted the most power over the eunuchs within recent memory‚Äîto which Emperor Xuanzong, appearing stressed, stated, \\"You are not correct. In reality, I am still fearful of them.\\" He tried to promote eunuchs that he trusted such that they would wield power, but according to himself, this tactic was not particularly successful, as the eunuchs that he promoted, once they became highly ranked, joined with the less obedient powerful eunuchs as well. At one point, he discussed with Linghu the possibility of massacring the eunuchs, which Linghu opposed because Linghu feared that the innocent as well as the guilty would be harmed; Linghu instead suggested gradually reducing the eunuchs' numbers. Linghu's proposal was leaked to the eunuchs, and the eunuchs were said to continue to despise the imperial officials because of this. Late in Emperor Xuanzong's reign, he came to favor certain alchemists who promised immortality, and he took pills that they made. It was said that as a result, he became paranoid and easily angered. By 859, as a side effect of those pills, he had a large ulcerous boil on his back, such that he was bedridden and could not meet with the chancellors or other officials. He entrusted Li Zi to three high-level eunuchs that he favored‚Äîthe directors of palace communications (Shumishi) Wang Guizhang () and Ma Gongru () and the director of the southern court affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩÂçóÈô¢‰Ωø, Xuanhui Nanyuanshi) Wang Jufang (). After Emperor Xuanzong died, Wang Guizhang, Ma, and Wang Jufang did not initially announce his death, and were set to send one of the eunuch commanders of the Shence Armies (), Wang Zongshi (), who was not on good terms with them, out of Chang'an to Huai'nan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to serve as the eunuch monitor for Huai'nan. Wang Zongshi, however, reacted by intruding into the palace; finding that Emperor Xuanzong had already died from Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning, he arrested Wang Guizhang, Ma, and Wang Jufang for falsely issuing edicts, and then put them to death. He welcomed Li Wen to the palace, and then issued an edict in Emperor Xuanzong's name creating Li Wen crown prince and changing his name to Li Cui. The next day, Emperor Xuanzong's death was announced, and Li Cui became emperor (as Emperor Yizong). =Relations with Muslims= During Sulaiman al-Tajir's stay at the city of Guangzhou he noted that the Chinese used fingerprint records to maintain the identities of newly arrived foreigners and charged extortionate rates for imported goods, and that the route to China by sea was dangerous due to piracy and frequent rain. He mentioned that the local Muslim populace of Guangzhou had their own mosque and bazaars. He mentioned that the Muslim community had its own Imam and Judge (appointed by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang).http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/China%201.pdf He also observed the manufacturing of porcelain, the granary system of Guangzhou, and how its municipal administration functioned.  Legacy  Because of the prosperity of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, it was said that in subsequent years, including after Tang's eventual fall in 907, the people missed him bitterly, referring to him as \\"Little Taizong.\\" The lead editor of the Old Book of Tang, the Later Jin chancellor Liu Xu, wrote of Emperor Xuanzong in glowing terms, while lamenting that much of the records from his reign had been lost by the time of Later Jin such that he could not write more. The lead editor of the New Book of Tang, Ouyang Xiu, however, commented that Emperor Xuanzong, while having good judgment, lacked kindness or grace.New Book of Tang, vol. 8.

Through her youngest daughter she was the mother-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, and great-great grandmother of the Emperor Nero. Biography = Parentage = Scribonia's parentage is unclear. It is known for certain that the name of her mother was Sentia,: Sentia Lib[onis] mater Scr[iboniae] Caes[aris]. whose ancestors had been directors of the mint. Her father is another matter; it is known that her father was a Lucius Scribonius Libo. The most commonly cited possibility was the praetor of that name of 80 BC. If this is so then she was the younger sister of a brother of the same name who was consul in 34 BC, whose daughter, another Scribonia, married Sextus Pompey. Another less common hypothesis was that she was a second daughter of the consul of 34 BC, rather than his sister.Scheid, J. \\"Scribonia Caesaris et les Julio-Claudiens: Probl√®mes de vocabulaire de parent√©\\", M√©moires de l'√âcole francaise de Rome et Ath√®nes. 87: 349-71. = First two marriages = According to Suetonius, Scribonia was married three times; her first two husbands were consuls.Suetonius, Life of Augustus, 62.2. \\"[Scribonia]... nuptam ante duobus consularibus, ex altero etiam matrem.\\" The name of the first is unknown, but a number of authorities -- including Bartolomeo Borghesi, Hermann Dessau, Edmund Groag and Ronald Syme -- have suggested that he was Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus, consul 56 BC, because of the existence of an inscription that refers to freedmen of Scribonia and her son Cornelius Marcellinus after 39 BC.: Libertorum et familiae Scribonae Caes. et Corneli Marcell. f. eius This indicates she had a son from her first marriage who was living with her after she was divorced from Octavian. Suetonius makes no mention of him, only acknowledging her children from her second and third marriagesSuetonius, Life of Augustus, 62.2 and 63.1., leading these authorities to conclude the young Marcellinus had died young. Since she was married a second time, this led to the need to identify her second husband, by whom she had Cornelia, the wife of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (suffect consul 34 BC), and would die the year her brother ascended to the consulate.Sextus Propertius, IV.11 Since it had been assumed Cornelius Marcellinus had died young, another brother had to be found, and various candidates had been proposed, most recently Publius Cornelius Scipio, consul in 16 BC. This would provide the year that the young Cornelia died. However, no consular father could be identified for this Cornelia Scipio, which led Syme to remark that the problem of identifying the husbands of Scribonia \\"appears insoluble\\".Syme, Roman Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939), p. 549 n. 16 However, as John Scheid has pointed out all of them over look that Suetonius clearly states there were no children by her first marriage. This would mean Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus was her second husband, not her first. Cornelia's brother was not the consul of 16 BC, but the consul of 18 BC, and that was the year of Cornelia died.Scheid, John, \\"Scribonia Caesaris et les Cornelii Lentuli\\", Bulletin de Correspondance Hell√©nique, 100 (1976), pp. 485-491. = Octavian = In 40 BC Scribonia was forced to divorce her second husband and marry Octavian who in turn had divorced his wife Clodia Pulchra. Octavian's motive in marrying Scribonia was to cement a political alliance with Sextus Pompey, husband to Scribonia's niece or sister. The marriage was brief and unhappy; he divorced her on the very same day as the birth of their daughter, Julia the Elder, his only natural child.Cassius Dio 48.34.3 He allegedly wrote that he was \\"unable to put up with her shrewish disposition.\\" He remarried to Livia Drusilla soon after. Scribonia herself never remarried and appears to have continued to be known as the wife of Caesar thereafter.CIL 6.7467. \\"Scriboniae Caesaris vestificis\\". In 6 BC or 5 BC, Augustus arranged a marriage between their granddaughter, Julia the Younger, to Lucius Aemilius Paullus, Cornelia's son and Scribonia's grandson, demonstrating his desire to maintain connections with his second wife's family. Despite her reputation from some modern historians as being \\"tiresome\\" and \\"morose\\"Syme, R. (1939) The Roman Revolution. Oxford. based on Octavian's reasons for divorce, she appears to have been a figure of some repute and standing. In 16 BC, the same year that her son rose to the consulship, her daughter Cornelia died and became the subject of an elegy by Propertius, in which Scribonia is mentioned. > Nor have I wronged you, Scribonia, mother, my sweet origin: what do you wish > changed in me, except my fate? My mother‚Äôs tears and the city‚Äôs grief exalt > me, and my bones are protected by Caesar‚Äôs moans. He laments that living I > was worthy sister to his daughter, and we have seen a god‚Äôs tears fall. Suetonius also notes Scribonia's affiliation with Scribonius Aphrodisius, slave and pupil of Lucius Orbilius Pupillus. He was afterwards purchased by Scribonia, possibly to educate her children or even herself, and he was subsequently manumitted by her. Based on this, it is possible that she encouraged him and others as a patroness. Aphrodisius is known to have written a now lost treatise on orthography, in opposition to Verrius Flaccus.Suetonius, Grammarians, 19.1. = Voluntary exile = In 2 BC, Julia was exiled to Pandateria for adultery and possible treason. Scribonia accompanied her voluntarily into exile.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History, Book II, 100.5. Around AD 4, Julia and Scribonia were allowed to return to the mainland and moved to Rhegium, where Augustus granted Julia property and a yearly income.Suetonius, Life of Tiberius, 50. Scribonia probably remained with her for the fifteen years Julia lived in exile. Julia died in AD 14, shortly after her father's own death. Contemporary historians are vague regarding the circumstances of her death; while Dio Cassius indicates Tiberius had her killed,Dio Cassius, Roman History, Book LVII.18. Tacitus writes that after her youngest son, Agrippa Postumus, was murdered she succumbed to despair and her health slowly declined. Scribonia survived her daughter and appears to have returned to the family mansion in Rome. = Last years = Scribonia's last known activity was around AD 16; when her great-nephew, Marcus Scribonius Libo Drusus, conspired against Tiberius she encouraged him to face trial and punishment rather than commit suicide, telling him, \\"What joy is there in doing another man's job?\\" Drusus did not listen and took his life shortly after.Seneca, Epistles, LXX.10. Although Seneca disapproves of Scribonia's advice, referring to her as \\"gravis femina; gravis\\", meaning ‚Äúdignified and severe\\" in an old fashioned Roman manner, modern historians have praised her as an exemplary Roman matron with the composure to sustain her rejected daughter Julia and suicidal nephew Scribonius in their tragic misfortunes.Fantham, Elaine.

Cultural depictions *In the novel, I, Claudius, Robert Graves incorrectly places Scribonia's death shortly before Augustus and Julia's, rather than after. *In Allan Massie's novel Augustus she is portrayed stereotypically; ugly, gap-toothed and fat. The novel implies Julia's behaviour is the result of her mother Scribonia rather than a perceived hypocrisy of her father Augustus. *Scribonia is a main character in the novel Caesar's Daughter by Edward Burton. She is a patroness of the arts, and enjoys popularity with the Roman people and Augustus' respect. Contrary to contemporary and modern historians accounts, she plays an active role in Julia's life. *In Elisabeth Dored's novel I Loved Tiberius, Augustus' reign is portrayed as a dictatorship. Scribonia is portrayed as a motherly and steadfast woman forbidden any contact with Julia until her exile. *She appears in the final novel in the Master of Rome series, Antony and Cleopatra, by Colleen McCullough. Octavius initially finds her very attractive and agreeable, but difficulties with the alliance and their marriage overall leads to its breakdown. Contrary to contemporary historians, Scribonia is allowed to partake in Julia's education. *Scribonia appears briefly in Cleopatra's Daughter (2009), by Michelle Moran. She is at a theater, watching her daughter, Julia, from afar because after the divorce they were not allowed to see each other; she is shunned by affluent society who are afraid of angering Augustus and Livia. *In Betray the Night: A Novel about Ovid by Benita Kane Jaro, Scribonia is portrayed as an elderly woman of great strength and personal distinction and courage, who all her life, in spite of the handicaps imposed on women, has been an important player in the factional and family politics of the Augustan period.

The classification is based on heuristics or rules, rather than patterns or signatures, and attempts to detect any type of misuse that falls out of normal system operation. This is as opposed to signature-based systems, which can only detect attacks for which a signature has previously been created. In order to positively identify attack traffic, the system must be taught to recognize normal system activity. The two phases of a majority of anomaly detection systems consist of the training phase (where a profile of normal behaviors is built) and testing phase (where current traffic is compared with the profile created in the training phase). Anomalies are detected in several ways, most often with artificial intelligence type techniques. Systems using artificial neural networks have been used to great effect. Another method is to define what normal usage of the system comprises using a strict mathematical model, and flag any deviation from this as an attack. This is known as strict anomaly detection. Other techniques used to detect anomalies include data mining methods, grammar based methods, and Artificial Immune System. Network-based anomalous intrusion detection systems often provide a second line of defense to detect anomalous traffic at the physical and network layers after it has passed through a firewall or other security appliance on the border of a network. Host-based anomalous intrusion detection systems are one of the last layers of defense and reside on computer end points. They allow for fine-tuned, granular protection of end points at the application level. Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection at both the network and host levels have a few shortcomings; namely a high false-positive rate and the ability to be fooled by a correctly delivered attack. Attempts have been made to address these issues through techniques used by PAYL and MCPAD.

Life story Born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina around 1767, Alexander attended the common schools and then Princeton College, graduating in 1787. He studied law and was admitted to the bar, practicing in Salisbury. Alexander was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons from the Salisbury District, serving from 1796 to 1803, and was a trustee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1799 to 1809. Following the resignation of Rep. Nathaniel Alexander, his cousin, Evan Shelby Alexander was chosen in a special election to fill the vacancy; he was elected to a term in regular Congressional elections in 1806, serving in the 9th and 10th Congresses and serving from February 24, 1806 to March 3, 1809. He died shortly after leaving Congress, on October 28, 1809.

Born on a farm near Glendon, North Carolina in Moore County in 1911, Alexander attended local public schools and then Duke University, graduating in 1932. He then studied law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was admitted to the bar in 1937. Practicing law in Kannapolis, North Carolina for several years, Alexander then served in the United States Navy during World War II from 1942 to 1946, including thirty-four months of duty overseas. In 1947 and 1949, Alexander served in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He was a solicitor for the Cabarrus County Recorders Court from 1950 to 1952 and a state commander for the American Legion in 1951. In 1952, Alexander was elected to the 83rd U.S. Congress, succeeding former Ways and Means chairman Robert Doughton. He was reelected four times, but never was able to establish a secure foothold in his district due to a somewhat liberal voting record and growing Republican influence in the district. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. North Carolina lost a congressional district after the 1960 census, and the state legislature saw a chance to get rid of Charlotte-area congressman Charles R. Jonas, then the only Republican in the North Carolina delegation. In the process, however, they added several Republican-leaning areas to Alexander's district. The plan backfired disastrously in the 1962 elections, in which Jonas won easily in his new district and Alexander lost by less than a percentage point to Republican furniture executive Jim Broyhill. After leaving Congress, he was chief counsel to the Senate Rules and Administration Committee from 1963 to 1976. Alexander died in Kannapolis in 1989.

Early life Alexander, born near Charlotte, North Carolina in 1840, attended preparatory schools in Rocky River and Wadesboro and graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1860. His uncle, William Graham, was Governor of North Carolina as well as Secretary of the Navy. Career At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, he enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private in the First Regiment, North Carolina Volunteer Infantry. He was elected captain of Company K, Forty-second North Carolina Regiment, in June 1862. He detached from his company in 1864 and served as inspector general on the staff of Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke. After the Civil War, Alexander was a member of the North Carolina Senate in 1879, 1883, 1885, 1887, where he was instrumental in the establishment of the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (later North Carolina State University; Alexander served on its board of trustees), and was president of the North Carolina Railroad. He became the first president of the North Carolina Farmers Alliance around 1887.History of North Carolina: North Carolina since 1860, p. 226. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of North Carolina in 1888. After his defeat at the state convention by Daniel Gould Fowle, Alexander was offered the nomination for Lieutenant Governor but declined.History of North Carolina: North Carolina since 1860, p. 228. A Democrat, Alexander was elected to the U.S. House in 1890 and served in the 52nd and 53rd Congresses. He did not run for a third term in 1894, but retired to his \\"Enderly Plantation\\" estate in Mecklenburg County. He served one additional term in the North Carolina Senate in 1901. Death and legacy  Alexander finally moved to Charlotte in 1906 and died there in 1921; he is buried in Elmwood Cemetery. His distant relatives include Vice President Adlai Stevenson and Senate Minority Leader John Sharp Williams.

Some (older) classifications list only two species in the genus Papio, this one and the hamadryas baboon. In those classifications, all other Papio species are considered subspecies of P. papio and the species is called the savanna baboon. The Guinea baboon inhabits a small area in western Africa. Its range includes Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, southern Mauritania and western Mali. Its habitat includes dry forests, gallery forests, and adjoining bush savannas or steppes. It has reddish-brown hair, a hairless, dark-violet or black face with the typical dog-like muzzle, which is surrounded by a small mane, and a tail carried in a round arc. It also has limb modifications that allow it to walk long distances on the ground. The Guinea baboon is one of the smallest baboon species, weighing between 13 and 26 kg (28.6‚Äì57 lbs). Their life spans are generally between 20 to 30 years. It is a diurnal and terrestrial animal, but sleeps in trees or high rocks at night, away from predators. The number of suitable sleeping trees limits the group size and the range. It lives in troops of up to 200 individuals, each with a set place in a hierarchy. Group living provides protection from predators such as the lion and various hyena species. Like all baboons, it is an omnivorous highly opportunistic feeder, eating fruits, buds, roots, bark, grasses, greens, seeds, tubers, leaves, nuts, cereals, insects, worms, birds and small mammals. Because it will eat practically anything available, the Guinea baboon is able to occupy areas with limited resources or harsh conditions. Its presence may help improve habitats because it digs for water and spreads seeds in its waste, encouraging plant growth. The Guinea baboon is a highly communicative animal. It communicates by using a variety of vocalizations and physical interactions. In addition to vocalizations to each other, this animal has vocal communications apparently intended to be received and interpreted by predators. Due to its small range and the loss of its habitat, the Guinea baboon is classified as \\"near threatened\\" by the IUCN.  Physical description  Baboon refers to the large-bodied primates with marked sexual dimorphism and having females and young that are dependent on males for protection. Guinean baboons have a red tone to their fur, and are sometimes referred to as the red baboon. They lack hair on their hindquarters, and their faces are black with yellow-brown sideburns. Females' rumps are pink in color and males have a mane of fur around their heads and shoulders. A characteristic feature of baboons is their long molars and broad incisors. The long canines are evidence of sexual dimorphism in baboon species. Their forelimbs and hindlimbs are nearly equal in length and their digits on their hands and feet are relatively short and stout, making it difficult for them to climb. Baboons are one of the largest groups of monkeys and are sexually dimorphic in body size (meaning the males and females have differing body sizes). They can range in weight from 13 and 26 kg (28‚Äì57 lbs), making them among the smallest of the baboon species.  Habitat and distribution  Generally found in woodland savannas, Guinea baboons seasonally congregate near permanent water sources, breaking off in the wet season into smaller groups. Baboon species are all allopatric, but some of their ranges do overlap, and some interbreeding does occur. These baboons are found in a wide range across Africa in savannah habitats. Its range includes Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, southern Mauritania and western Mali. Most typically they are in the forests and savannah of sub-Saharan Africa. They can also be found in grasslands, rain forests, and other open areas. Ecology Guinea baboons are diurnal, living on the ground instead of in trees, and typically sleep in trees at the terminal ends of branches. Their group size is widely variable and ranges from 40 to 200. However, the most common troop size is 30‚Äì40 individuals. Often, a pronounced male hierarchy and fierce competition for females happens within the group. This competition leads to sexual dimorphism among the species. When it comes to feeding, they are independent foragers, and females are always paired with males when foraging so they can be protected. Females may choose to follow the same males from year to year. = Diet = Like other baboon species, Guinea baboons will eat any available foods, but their main sources are fruits, roots, tubers, grass, seeds and leaves. They also will eat insects, worms, spiders, small mammals, birds and invertebrates.  Behavior  Female and juvenile at Port Lympne Wild Animal Park Socially, Guinea baboons have more in common with Hamadryas baboons than other baboon species, living in one male units , consisting of one dominant male, several females and juveniles, and often a follower male. These groups are usually small, but join with larger groups to form a troop; these groups sleep or forage together. The Guinean troops are large multiple-male, multiple-female troops with 50‚Äì300 baboons. The harems consist of two to five females which mate with the dominant male. However, despite their similarities, Guinea baboon social behaviour has a few noticeable differences from that of Hamadryas baboons. Males frequently use reconciliation gestures to reduce male-male aggression and encourage cooperation, allowing troops to grow to large size and adapt to different circumstandes. While male Hamadryas baboons forcibly acquire females for their harems by kidnapping them and utilising neck-bites to condition them to stay near, female guinea baboons select males at their own leisure, males typically using facial expressions and gestures to guide their movement and grooming them to win over their loyalty. In Guinea baboons, Harem masters are noticeably less strict with their female consorts than Hamadryas baboon harem masters. Female Guinea baboons often fraternize with other females from other harems and even other males without being reprimanded by their male consort. Females approach males to initiate mating behaviour as they please and even mate with more than one male (although they mate with the harem master the most), a far cry from the more \\"faithful\\" female Hamadryas baboons. As seen in chimpanzees, Olive baboons and various macaque species, this promiscuity most likely is practiced to hide the paternity of their infants as a counterstrategy against male infanticide, which occurs in Hamadryas baboons but hasn't yet been observed in Guinea baboons (although male guinea baboons have been observed temporarily kidnapping then returning infants). Male-on- male competition for females is noticeably reduced or absent. Unlike Hamadryas baboons and some other species, Guinea baboons are not very good climbers and favor trees, rather than high rocks or cliffs for sleeping. The more dominant males sleep on the heavier, thicker branches near the trunk of the tree and lower ranking members and juveniles sleep on the smaller and weaker branches further from the trunk. During daylight hours, they spend the majority of their time foraging on the ground, running along in quadrupedal patterns. = Communication = The Guinea baboons have a host of vocal, visual, and tactile communications. Their several vocal calls each convey several different messages, and consist of predator warnings, signaling friendly intentions, submissive calls, and anger or frustration vocalizations. Many of these calls can be used in combination with either each other or with some other form of visual or tactile communication. Visual communications serve many of the same purposes as the vocal calls, and are often accompanied by some sort of vocal call. Lower ranking animals appease more dominant ones with an \\"Ack ack\\" vocalization and \\"Wahoo\\" alarm calls are uttered if a threat presents itself. Tactile communication is usually tied to visual communication and can range from mouth-to-mouth touching to biting or slapping. Male Guinea baboons are unlike other baboons species, as they form intimate friendships with other males, fondling each others genitals as a gesture of greeting, as well as mounting each other and huddling together. = Reproduction = Female Guinea baboons exhibit sexual swelling that begins about 10 to 12 days before it peaks and remains consistent for about eight days afterwards. Females then participate in the social behavior of presenting, which is when she signals to the males in the group she is ready for copulation. The mean gestation period is about six months and nursing continues until about six to eight months. Females rebuff a male's advances by shrieking at him and often climbing up a tree.

The European equivalent is the league. In modern terms the distance is about 3 or 3¬Ω miles (4.8 or 5.6 km). The parasang may have originally been some fraction of the distance an infantryman could march in some predefined period of time. Mid-5th-century BCE Herodotus (v.53) speaks of [an army] traveling the equivalent of five parasangs per day. In antiquity, the term was used throughout much of the Middle East, and the Old Iranian language from which it derives can no longer be determined (only two--of what must have been dozens--of Old Iranian languages are attested). There is no consensus with respect to its etymology or literal meaning. In addition to its appearance in various forms in later Iranian languages (e.g. Middle Persian frasang or Sogdian fasukh), the term also appears in Greek as parasangƒìs (), in Latin as ', in Hebrew as parasa (◊§◊®◊°◊î), in Armenian as hrasakh (), in Georgian as parsakhi, in Syriac as pars·∏•ƒÅ (), in Turkish as ', and in Arabic as farsakh (). The present-day New Persian word is also farsakh (), and should not be confused with the present- day farsang (), which is a metric unit. The earliest surviving mention of the parasang comes from the mid-5th-century BCE Herodotus (Histories ii.6, v.53, vi.42), who defines the measure to be equivalent to 30 stadia, or half a schoenus. A length of 30 stadia is also given by several later Greek and Roman writers (10th-century Suidas and Hesychius, 5th/4th-century BCE Xenophon Anab. ii.2.6). The 6th-century AD Agathias (ii.21) however--while referring to Herodotus and Xenophon--notes that in his time the contemporary Persians considered the parasang to have only 21 stadia. Strabo (xi.xi.5) also notes that some writers considered it to be 60, others 40, and yet others 30. In his 1st-century Parthian stations, Isidore of Charax \\"evidently [used for schoenus] the same measure as the Arabic parasang (while in Persia proper 4 sch[onii] equal 3 par[asang]).\\" The 1st-century Pliny (Natural History vi.26) noted that the Iranians themselves assigned different lengths to it. The Bundahishn (GBd XXII), a 9th/10th-century text of Zoroastrian tradition, glosses Avestan language hathra as equivalent to a \\"parasang of 1000 paces\\" (a Roman mile), and then defines the parasang as the distance at which a man with good eyesight could determine whether a beast of burden was black or white. On the authority of older sources, the 14th-century Qazvinian historiographer Hamdullah Mostofi recorded that in the 10th century the north-eastern parasang was 15,000 paces, the north-western one was 18,000 paces, and the one of the south-west was merely 6,000 paces (but the \\"true\\" parasang, so Mostofi, was 9,000 paces). Recalling local legend, Mostofi states the unit was defined by the mythological Kai Kobad to be equal to 12,000 cubits. Following the 30-stadia definition of Herodotus and Xenophon, the parasang would be equal to either 5.7 km (Olympic measure) or 5.3 km (Attic measure). But in 1920, Kenneth Mason of the Royal Geographical Society adduced that the parasang used in Xenophon's Babylonian travel accounts was equal to only 2.4 miles (3.9 km). A mid-1960s search for the Parthian city of Hekatompylos based on distances given in mid-4th-century BCE chronologies of Alexander's conquests generated empirical estimates of ten stades to the English mile (1.609 km), and three miles to the parasang (4.827 km). \\"Whatever the basis of calculation, theoretical values for the stade and the parasang must be sought which do not greatly exceed [those] estimates.\\" A 1985 suggestion proposes that the parasang and Attic stade were defined in terms of the Babylonian beru, an astromically-derived sexagesimal unit of time and linear distance. At 1 beru = 60 stadia = 2 parasang, the parasang could then \\"be expressed as 10,800 'common' [i.e. trade] Babylonian cubits, or 18,000 Attic feet, both figures exactly.\\" A 2010 study of the term parasang in Xenophon's account of Cyrus the Younger's late-5th-century BCE campaign against Artaxerxes II demonstrated that the length of Xenophon's parasang varied with weather and the terrain across which the army travelled. The parasangs were longer when the road was flat and dry, but shorter when travel was slower. The term has survived in Modern Greek in the stereotypical expression \\"Œ±œÄŒ≠œáŒµŒπ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÉŒ¨Œ≥Œ≥Œ±œÇ\\", i.e., \\"it is parasangs away\\", meaning that something is very far away from something else, particularly in terms of quality. As Hebrew 'parsah' (pl. parsaoth), the parasang also finds use in the Babylonian Talmud, in several uses, for instance in a description of the biblical ladder to heaven, the width of which is given as 8,000 parsaoth (Chullin 91b). In the commentary of Pesachim 9, the 4th-century Rabbah bar bar Hana, on the authority of the 3rd-century Rabbi Johanan, gives ten parsaoth as the distance that a man can walk in a day.B.Pesachim 93b The farsang was also used as an Ethiopian unit for length.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2000‚Äì2013 for the Colorado Rockies, Florida/Miami Marlins, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies. Known for his speed, he stole 614 bases in his career, the 18th-most in MLB history at the time of his retirement. He worked as an MLB Network on-air analyst before joining the Marlins as a Minor League Outfield Coordinator for the 2019 season. Early years Pierre was born in Mobile, Alabama to Derry and James. Soon after his birth, his family moved to Alexandria, Louisiana. The Pierres have been deeply rooted in Louisiana since colonial times and are of Creole heritage. Pierre was named after Dominican Hall of Fame pitcher and former Giants player Juan Marichal, his father's favorite player, who also gave him his middle name, D'Vaughn, because he said it had a \\"good rhyme to it.\\" Pierre attended Alexandria Senior High School. College Prior to his professional career, he played at Galveston College and the University of South Alabama, where he was Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year. Minor leagues Pierre began his professional career with the Portland Rockies of the Northwest League after being selected by Colorado in the 13th round of the 1998 MLB draft. He won the league batting and stolen base titles in his first professional season with 38 and was a fan favorite even at that level. Pierre moved on to the Asheville Tourists the following year, again batting well over .300 and began with the Carolina Mudcats before finishing the year in Colorado. Major leagues =Colorado Rockies= Pierre made his major league debut on August 7, 2000, as a pinch runner for the Rockies against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He made his first start in center field the following day and got his first hit in the first inning off Jos√© Silva. =Florida Marlins= On November 16, , Pierre was traded along with Mike Hampton and cash to the Florida Marlins for Charles Johnson, Preston Wilson, Vic Darensbourg, and Pablo Ozuna. In the 2003 regular season, Pierre posted a .305 batting average, led the NL in games played (162), at bats (668), stolen bases (65), and sacrifice hits (15), and he led the majors with the lowest strikeout percentage (5.2%). During the post- season, he was a major contributor to the Marlins' 2003 World Series championship. He batted .333 in the World Series and .301 overall in his first playoff experience. In 2004, he led the National League in at-bats (for the second year in a row) with 678; hits (221); triples (12); games played (162); bunt hits (24); infield hits (38); (5.2%). In addition, he was the only major league player to play every inning of each of his team's games. In , Pierre led the National League in games played (162) and had the third-lowest strikeout percentage in baseball (6.9%). =Chicago Cubs= Chicago Cubs in 2006 On December 7, 2005, the Marlins traded Pierre to the Chicago Cubs, receiving pitchers Sergio Mitre, Ricky Nolasco, and Renyel Pinto in exchange. The deal was motivated by the Marlins' need to cut payroll after being unable to secure a new stadium deal in South Florida. In 2006, while batting .292, Pierre led the NL with 204 hits, winning his second hit title, and he led the NL in at-bats (699), games played (162), bunt hits (21), infield hits (30), and lowest strikeout percentage (5.4%). He also tied for the major league lead in times reached base on an error (13), and played perfect defensive baseball, earning a fielding percentage of 1.000. However, he also led the major leagues in outs made (532), the second-highest out total for a player since . =Los Angeles Dodgers= On November 22, 2006, Pierre signed a $44 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In , Pierre led the majors in bunt hits (19). He also led the NL in games played (162) for the fifth straight year, led the NL in singles (164) for the second straight year, led the league in sacrifice hits (20), and had the lowest strikeout percentage in the NL (5.5%). He was second in the NL in stolen bases (64), third in at bats (668) and plate appearances (729), fourth in hits (196), and ninth in triples (8). Pierre during his tenure with the Dodgers in spring training Going into , the Dodgers signed Andruw Jones to a two-year contract to play center field. Because of this, Pierre shifted to left field. After a trip to the DL in July, Pierre was moved into a platoon in center field with the struggling Jones. When the Dodgers traded for Manny Ramirez, Pierre moved to the bench and saw limited action, primarily as a pinch runner the rest of the season. Manager Joe Torre said of Pierre on MLB.com: \\"I've delivered bad news to him two years in a row‚àífirst with Andruw Jones, then when Manny came on board. He's more understanding about being a backup. He's been a pro through this whole thing.\\" After nearly two years without hitting a home run, Pierre hit a ball into the right field seats at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on September 15, 2008. It was Pierre's first traditional fly-ball home run since August 28, 2006, also in Pittsburgh. Prior to the start of the 2009 season, the Dodgers gave Pierre and his agent permission to talk to other teams in hopes of working out a trade because Ramirez's re-signing with the Dodgers pushed Pierre to the backup role in left field. When Manny Ramirez received a 50-game suspension, Pierre once more became the Dodgers' regular left fielder. During Ramirez's suspension, Pierre delivered a stellar performance that drew praise from fans and critics alike. However, once Ramirez returned, he resumed his previous role of a backup player. In recognition of his hard work, Dodgers fans gave him a standing ovation on July 16‚àí the same game where Ramirez had his first home game since returning from suspension. =Chicago White Sox= Chicago White Sox in 2011 On December 15, 2009, Pierre was traded to the Chicago White Sox for two minor league pitching prospects to be named later (Jon Link and John Ely). Pierre led Major League Baseball with 68 stolen bases, the second-most in a single season in franchise history after only Rudy Law's 77 in 1983. On August 3, 2010, he hit his first and only home run of 2010 off Rick Porcello. On August 5, 2010, he stole his 500th career base against the Detroit Tigers. In 2011, Pierre led the major leagues in sacrifice hits (19) and at bats per strikeout (15.6), and he was caught stealing a major-league-leading 17 times (while stealing 27 bases). On defense, he tied for the major league lead in errors by a left fielder, with 7. =Philadelphia Phillies= On January 27, 2012 Pierre signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Phillies purchased his contract on March 29, and he was subsequently added to their opening day roster. He hit a three-run home run on June 23. On June 28, he got his 500th career RBI. In 130 games‚àí98 starting in left field‚àíPierre hit .307/.351/.371 with 6 triples and 37 stolen bases. =Miami Marlins= Miami Marlins in 2013 On November 17, 2012, Pierre signed a one-year, $1.6 million deal with the Miami Marlins. He played the 2013 season with Miami and became a free agent at the end of the season. He had hoped to sign with another team and was often mentioned in press reports about teams requiring depth in the outfield to cover for injured or under-performing players.Mike Axisa CBS Sports, Nationals Have Options to Replace Harper; OF Sidelined Until July, April 28, 2014 However, he went unsigned for the entire season and announced his retirement from professional baseball on February 27, 2015. Pierre was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019 but received less than 5% of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot. =Career statistics= In 1994 games over 14 seasons, Pierre posted a .295 batting average (2217-for-7525) with 1075 runs, 255 doubles, 94 triples, 18 home runs, 517 RBI, 614 stolen bases, 464 bases on balls, .343 on-base percentage and .361 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .990 fielding percentage playing at center and left field. In 26 postseason games, he hit .304 (24-for-79) with 16 runs, 5 doubles, 2 triples, 7 RBI, 3 stolen bases and 8 walks.

Fasnacht, a mixture of Christian and pre- Christian beliefs, is a pre-Lenten Carnival. Swiss folklore describes a collection of local stories, celebrations, and customs of the alpine and sub- alpine peoples that occupy Switzerland. The country of Switzerland is made up of several distinct cultures including German, French, Italian, as well as the Romansh speaking population of Graub√ºnden. Each group has its own unique folkloric tradition. Switzerland has always occupied a crossroads of Europe. While Switzerland has existed as an alliance and country since 1291, the Swiss as a culture and people existed well before this time. Before the Swiss, the region was occupied by Pagan and later Christian Germanic tribes which would become the Swiss. Before the Germanic peoples, the region was occupied by Roman and Gallo-Roman populations. Finally, before the Romans the Celtic Helvetii lived in what would become Switzerland. In addition to conquest, Switzerland has been a crossroads of Europe since at least the Roman Empire. Constant movement of cultures and ideas into Switzerland has created a rich and varied folklore tradition. The study of folklore (Folkloristics) is known as Volkskunde in German. The study of Swiss folklore originates in the 19th century. The central figure of its academic development is Eduard Hoffmann- Krayer, who founded the Swiss Society for Volkskunde in 1896. Almabtrieb at Mels in 2019. Festivals Tatzelwurm fountain in Kobern-Gondorf * Berchtoldstag, festival in honour of Berchta or Berchtold. * Fasnacht (or Fastnacht), a pre-Lenten carnival. ** Eis-zwei-Geissebei, a Fasnacht event for children in Rapperswil. * Klausjagen, parade festival on the eve of St. Nicholas Day. * Sechsel√§uten, a spring fire festival. * Tsch√§gg√§t√§, masked carnival parade.Customs and Traditions in Switzerland accessed 20 May 2008 * Ubersitz, a Christmas parade festival. Customs * B√§regr√§ubschi and Ch√∂derchessi are traditional wedding presents in the Simmental (Bernese Oberland). The former is a kind of fork symbolising the male element in the wedding, and the latter is a magical bucket representing the female aspect. Reported in an Italian anthology of Alpine culture in the 1860s, it is unknown whether this custom is still practiced.POPOLI DEL MONDO USI E COSTUMI. Europa. MILANO VALLARDI S.D., 1913, p. 26. * R√§√§beliechtli (\\"turnip lights\\") are lanterns hand-carved from turnips. The turnip is hollowed out and designs are carved into it, which are lit by a candle in the turnip. The children of the villages then walk through the streets of their town with the lanterns and sing traditional songs. The custom originates with thanksgiving traditions at the end of harvest in November. Mythical beings * Barbegazi, a small white-furred man with large feet. Helpful and shy, they live in the mountains and are rarely seen. * Berchtold, a white-cloaked being and leader of the Wild Hunt. * B√∂√∂gg, or bogeyman, of the Sechsel√§uten festival. * Dragons, serpentine monsters often having wings and breathing fire. One such tale involved a cooper who drunkenly stumbled into a cave where he encountered a pair of these creatures. These dragons were unusual in that they were friendly and allowed the cooper to stay with them through the winter. However, when he returned home in the spring he found that he was so used to eating dragon food that he could no longer stomach human fare, and eventually starved to death.Griffis, William Elliot (1920). Swiss Fairy Tales. Thomas Y. Crowell Co. pp. 66‚Äì76. Dragonet (\\"little dragon\\") tales originated in Switzerland during the Middle Ages. * Dwarfs are little men associated with hills and the earth. Described as happy and helpful, they raise cattle and produce magical cheeses. This cheese has the property of replenishing itself as long as a piece is left over after eating. They are sometimes portrayed as wearing green cloaks and red caps, and having long white beards.Griffis (1920), p. 57. They live in caves and minesGriffis (1920), p. 132. and they know where subterranean treasures may be found.Griffis (1920), p. 56. They are guardians of the chamois, a species of mountain goat.Griffis (1920), pp. 56, 134‚Äì135. They are expert blacksmiths and weaponsmiths, and despite their good nature they will play vengeful pranks if they are insulted or mistreated. * Fairies, a general class of magical beings. In Swiss fairy tale literature they are ruled by a Fairy Queen, are associated with flowers and warmth, and have frequent battles with the frost giants.Griffis (1920), pp. 77‚Äì90, 144‚Äì156. * Frost Giants inhabit the high peaks of the Alps and are ruled by a Frost King. Their children take the form of avalanches, and the giants take great pride in the destruction caused by them.Griffis (1920), pp. 39‚Äì47. They have the ability to freeze any living thing that gets near them.Griffis (1920), p. 78. They are sometimes portrayed as having long beards made of icicles and wearing wooden shoes hollowed out from the trunks of fir trees. Frost giants may literally melt into puddles of cold water if the weather is too warm or if they are exposed to the charms of a particularly beautiful fairy.Griffis (1920), pp. 198‚Äì199. * Gnomes, earth spirits or elementals from the writings of the Swiss physician Paracelsus.Hall, Manly P. (1997, 1964). Paracelsus: His Mystical and Medical Philosophy. Philosophical Research Society. pp. 53, 69‚Äì72, 74, 77‚Äì78. . They are said to have caused the landslide that destroyed the Swiss village of Plurs in 1618. The villagers had become wealthy from a local gold mine created by the gnomes who poured liquid gold down into a vein for the benefit of humans. This newfound prosperity led to the corruption of the village which greatly offended the gnomes.Guerber, H. A. (1899). Legends of Switzerland. Dodd, Mead & Co.. pp. 289‚Äì290. * Herwisch is similar to the will-o'-the-wisp. They inhabit marshy terrain and turn their lanterns on at night, leading travelers astray to flounder in the water. If they are mocked or angered, they will frighten the offender by chasing him and flapping their wings in his face.Griffis (1920), pp. 195‚Äì196. The Herwisch is also part of the folklore of Germany where it displays the same characteristics.Guerber, H. A. (1895). Legends of the Rhine. A. S. Barnes & Co. pp. 80‚Äì81. * Huttefroueli (or Greth Schell), an old woman who carries her husband on her back in the Ubersitz festival. * Imps, evil spirits that ride on the F√∂hn or south wind.Griffis (1920), p. 88. * Jack-of-the-Bowl, a house spirit and the most well known Swiss kobold, otherwise known as Jean de la Boli√©ta in French, or Napf-Hans in German. In return for a bowl of sweet cream left out for him each night, he would lead the cows to graze in places considered dangerous to humans, but none of the cows ever suffered injury. The path used by him was always clear of stones no matter how rocky the mountainside, and this came to be known as Boli√©ta's Path. * Jack Frost, a personification of winter.Griffis (1920), pp. 81, 84. * Kobolds (or \\"Servants\\") are house spirits related to dwarfs but they inhabit remote dwellings and shielings (summer houses used by herdsmen on the mountains). The most well known Swiss kobold is Jean de la Boli√©ta (Jack-of- the-Bowl), or Napf-Hans in German. * Mountain Giants are primordial giants that live in caves and are big and strong but simpleminded compared to humans. Valleys were formed when they walked about on the earth, and rivers were formed from the weeping of their wives and daughters when they were mistreated by their male kinsmen. Gargantua (\\"Old Gargy\\") is their king and Bertha is his daughter. Hotap was a giant who enjoyed eating humans, and his friend Schoppe was a personification of alcoholic beverages (similar to John Barleycorn), especially the destructive consequences of overconsumption. Hotap was unable to resist his partner's influence and eventually drank himself to death.Griffis (1920), pp. 48‚Äì55. * Perchta (or Berchta, Bertha, \\"The Shining One\\"), Germanic goddess and white-cloaked leader of the Perchten who drive bad spirits away, and female leader of the Wild Hunt. 6 January is her festival day. * Perchten, those followers who work with Perchta, and also the name of their wooden animal masks. * Samichlaus leads a donkey laden with treats and toys for children. * Schmutzli is one of the Companions of Saint Nicholas. He has a dark or sooty complexion and accompanies St. Nicholas on his gift-giving rounds. He carries switches and a sack in which he puts bad children.Bowler, Gerry (2000). The World Encyclopedia of Christmas. McClelland & Stewart. pp. 103, 201. . In the French-speaking cantons he is known as P√®re Fouettard (\\"Father Whipper\\").Klobuchar, Lisa (1995). Christmas in Switzerland. World Book, Inc. pp. 24, 37. . * Schnabelgeiss, a tall goat with a beak in the Ubersitz festival. * Tatzelwurm (or Stollenwurm) combines the features of a cat and a serpent, allegedly photographed by a Swiss photographer named Balkin in 1934. * Undines, water spirits or elementals from the writings of Paracelsus.Hall (1997, 1964), pp. 53, 69. They are usually portrayed in Swiss fairy tales as young maidens who love to sit or dance near brooks and rivers or in marshes among the reeds. They have wavy golden hair with a wreath of pond lilies, and are clothed in white mist, for which reason they are also known as mist maidens. They do not like to be seen but may be encountered on moonlit nights.Griffis (1920), pp. 193‚Äì194. There are also male undines, though less frequent, and in one tale there is even a king of the undines who brings a human princess down to his crystal palace beneath a lake to make her his bride. Both male and female undines are able to disguise themselves as mortals, though their fairy nature may be revealed by their green clothing which will always feel wet.Griffis (1920), pp. 201‚Äì208. * Vogel Gryff (\\"Griffin Bird\\") Legends The Abbey of St. Gall, founded on the site of his hermitage The legends of Switzerland include historic and semi-mythic people and places that shaped the history and culture of the nation. =Christianization= * Saint Gall, an Irish monk who in the early 7th century helped introduce Christianity to eastern Switzerland. The Abbey of St. Gall is believed to have been built on the site of his hermitage. * Magnus of F√ºssen, a missionary saint in southern Germany. He was active in the 7th or 8th century and is considered the founder of St. Mang's Abbey, F√ºssen. * Saint Fridolin, patron of Glarus. He is traditionally believed to be an Irish saint who founded S√§ckingen Abbey, Baden, in the 6th or 7th century. According to legend, he converted a landowner who left his estates, now the Canton of Glarus, to Fridolin. When the landowner's brother took Fridolin to court over the gift, Fridolin raised the landowner from the dead to confirm its legitimacy. =Old Swiss Confederacy= A fresco showing William Tell and his son after he shot an apple off his son's head. * Teufelsbr√ºcke is a bridge which was supposedly erected by the Devil. * William Tell is a Swiss folk hero who was forced to shoot an apple off his son's head by the tyrannical reeve of Habsburg Austria. After successfully shooting the apple and escaping the reeve's men, he assassinated the reeve and started a revolution.Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, Verlag des Bibliographischen Instituts, Leipzig und Wien, Fourth edition, 1885‚Äì1892, entry on \\"Tell, Wilhelm,\\" pp. 576‚Äì77 in volume 15. In German. He became a central figure in Swiss patriotism as it was constructed during the Restoration of the Confederacy after the Napoleonic era. * R√ºtlischwur, a legendary oath of the Old Swiss Confederacy, taken on the R√ºtli, a meadow above Lake Lucerne, by three men representing Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden. It became connected to the legend of William Tell. * Arnold Winkelried was a possibly legendary hero of the Swiss Battle of Sempach against the Habsburg Duke Leopold III of Austria. According to the story, when the Swiss army was unable to break through the Austrian pikes, Winkelried threw himself on the pikes and used his body to open a hole in the Austrian lines leading to the Swiss victory at Sempach. Though the existence of Arnold Winkelried is disputed, the story was another central part of Swiss patriotism in the 19th century. * Bruder Klaus was a Swiss monk and ascetic who is considered the patron saint of Switzerland. In 1481 the leaders of the Old Swiss Confederacy began quarreling over treasure from the Burgundian Wars and civil war appeared likely. Bruder Klaus was consulted and passed a secret message to the quarreling leaders. The message, the contents of which are unknown, calmed the tempers and led to the drawing up of the Stanser Verkommnis which expanded the Confederation.

It is highly popular and it hosts many events each year that attract people from across Teesside and further afield. Parking is free, but the Preston Park Museum & Grounds and Butterfly World have small admission charges. The land was originally a private residence with large grounds but has since become the property of Stockton Borough Council after being purchased from Sir Robert Ropner. and was redeveloped in 2010-12, with the Museum reopening in 2012. The museum has a thriving and diverse volunteer community with its participants ranging from students to the retired. They carry out a range of roles in the Museum, ranging from gardening, to gallery stewarding, supporting learning to being costumed interpreters on the Victorian Street. Areas of interest Preston Park is made up of several diverse areas: =Hall= Preston Hall it was not until 1882, when the estate and lands were sold to Robert Ropner for the princely sum of ¬£27,500(¬£1,328,525.00 in modern money) that the building of today was born. Ropner was a wealthy shipping and industrial magnate, and in common with the style of the times, demanded a home to befit his status in society. Major alterations included the addition of a Winter Garden, Music Room, Billiard Room, entrance portico and extensive landscaped parkland ‚Äì all ‚Äòmust haves‚Äô of the Victorian age. The Hall & Park was served by legions of staff, from a butler and cook, through to maids and stable hands. Gardeners would tend the grounds and supply the kitchen with produce from the walled garden, which was restored and reopened to the public in 2012. In 1937, the Hall & Park passed into the hands of a number of companies, before being purchased by Stockton Corporation (now the Borough Council) in 1947.The site officially opened as Preston Hall Museum and Park in 1953, and has continued to bring pleasure to generations of visitors young and old ever since. Following a successful bid for funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council, the Museum and Park have recently re-opened following an extensive redevelopment work. The ¬£7 million transformation has seen significant improvements to facilities, including better access, the repair and conservation of the Grade II listed building and the development of further features, interpretation and exhibits. Exhibits in the museum include the Yarm helmet, a ca 10th-century Viking age helmet that was found in Yarm. It is the first relatively complete Anglo-Scandinavian helmet found in Britain and only the second Viking helmet discovered in north-west Europe. =Showground= The flat, grassed area in front of the main house is now the main staging ground for large events held in the park. It is easily able to hold the largest of circus tents and other temporary structures. When not being used for an event, this area will often contain people playing sports or picnicking with their children. The field is used for training by a number of football teams, and a local Frisbee team. The field does however suffer from drainage problems meaning that it often becomes waterlogged. =Butterfly World= This building houses an environment specially controlled to allow a variety of exotic butterflies to thrive. There is a charge for entry. =Caf√©= Beside the main car park is a caf√© operated by Stockton Borough Council. =Adventure Play Area= Adjacent to the caf√© is an extensive play area containing a variety of traditional swings and more adventurous climbing equipment for children of all ages. =Teesside Small Gauge Railway= Across the showground from the car park is a model engineering club with a miniature railway. It operates to the public during the summer on Sunday afternoons and on bank holidays from 1pm to 4pm. =Quarry Wood= The Quarry Wood was declared a nature reserve in 2004. It is a former Victorian Quarry that has now been reclaimed by nature. This is a popular place for younger mountain bikers, with the main attraction being \\"The Dippers\\". These are a series of dirt jumps and gravel corners created by the natural terrain. They are mostly fenced off in an attempt to protect the public from out-of-control bikes. \\"The Big Dipper\\" is a 15 ft-deep cut in the ground which is used as a kind of half- pipe. From the top of the slope, riders can aim at a variety of take-off points on the other side, each of which provides differing amounts of \\"air time\\". There are a variety of smaller jumps nearby, as well as some rougher cycling routes. Furthermore, Quarry Wood is home to a wide spectrum of wildlife including frogs, toads, newts, foxes, rabbits and birds such as moorhen and owls, as well as a host of invertebrates. =Skatepark= A concrete skatepark opened on the former site of the crazy golf course in 2014. The project was built by Wheelscape and cost ¬£25,000. The skatepark is vary varied and suits a wide range of skill levels. Previous Attractions The world's first passenger railway ran through the grounds beside the main road in the 19th Century until 1852. There was no station. In the 1970s and 80s there was a small zoo within the park, partly covering the area now used by the playground and stretching down to the hall. It famously had a penguin enclosure. There were also llamas and chipmunks, among others. Previously in front of the caf√© was a simple crazy golf course. However, the golf course was removed in 2014 to make way for the skatepark. Relocation of Egglescliffe School In 2009 it was proposed by Ingleby Barwick Councillors that Egglescliffe School be relocated within the park with a foot bridge linking the school to the estate. The proposal was backed by the then MP for Stockton South Dari Taylor, but was strongly opposed by many residents in the local area due to the loss of valuable public park land. The Conservative candidate for the Stockton-South seat James Wharton also opposed the proposal before narrowly winning the seat in the 2010 election. Leaflets from Dari Taylor's party have since expressed regret for not opposing the development of Preston Park. The proposal for the development (coded option D2) has now been removed as a viable option. The reasons given are that the funding for the new foot bridge would not have been granted from central government, and that \\"During the feasibility work undertaken, the location of the proposed bridge also raised significant engineering issues. In addition to this, any additional traffic from a community school facility could not be accommodated without significant upgrading of the road network.\\", and that the Preston Park allotments would have had to be moved. From this issue was also born 'Friends of Preston Park. This group, consisting of members of the public brings to attention any issues that become apparent to visitors and presents them to the management of Preston Park during meetings.

Ben√≠tez debuted with the Baltimore Orioles in 1994 and within a few years became their closer. He was a reliever for several other organizations after Baltimore in 1999 and last played in Major League Baseball in 2008. His 289 saves rank 31st all time. After 2008, he played in minor league and independent league baseball. Early life Armando Germ√°n Ben√≠tez was born in San Pedro de Macor√≠s, in the Dominican Republic. His parents, father Francisco and mother Constancia, separated when he was young, so Armando was raised by his mother. She made a living by hand-washing clothes. Armando has two brothers, Francisco, Jr. and Osiri, as well as a sister, Senovia. Ben√≠tez learned to play baseball when he was 14, when his stature was a lanky 6'2\\", 140 pounds. He began to play baseball at a local academy and was originally an outfielder and third baseman. Professional career =Baltimore Orioles= Ben√≠tez was signed in by the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent. Coming up through the Orioles' farm system, he made his debut in . While with the Orioles, he initially struggled, collecting a 5.66 ERA in and faltering in the postseason frequently. In the 1996 ALCS he yielded the infamous Jeffrey Maier home run, sprinting all the way to right field to confront the umpire, Rich Garcia, who made the call. In 1997 Ben√≠tez had a breakout year, as he excelled in the set up role for Orioles' closer Randy Myers, forming a lethal 1‚Äì2 punch at the back end of the Orioles bullpen and propelling them to the AL East pennant. By 1998 he started to show some of his future potential earning a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves in 71 games. However, during a game against the New York Yankees on May 19, 1998, Ben√≠tez was ejected for hitting Tino Martinez with a pitch that led to a massive brawl between the two teams. Although Ben√≠tez denied hitting Martinez intentionally, few Orioles defended his actions and he was assessed an eight-game suspension by American League President Gene Budig, and his own manager even apologized to the Yankees for Benitez's behavior. It was the second time he had drilled Martinez, which caused Martinez's incensed reaction. He did the same thing three years before when Martinez was playing for the Seattle Mariners after surrendering an Edgar Mart√≠nez grand slam, which had led to his demotion to the minors at that time. =New York Mets= Before the season, Ben√≠tez was traded to the New York Mets in a three-team deal, in which catcher Charles Johnson joined the Orioles while Todd Hundley was sent to the Los Angeles Dodgers, with Roger Cede√±o also joining Benitez in New York. Benitez initially served as the setup man for longtime Mets closer John Franco; however, when Franco went down with an injury mid-way through the 1999 season, Benitez assumed the job and was named the full-time Mets closer even after Franco's return. However, he continued his late season and postseason struggles. In Game 4 of the 1999 NL Division Series, after notoriously arriving late to the ballpark in Game 4, he was called upon to protect a 2-1 lead in the 8th inning against the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, but allowed a two-run double as the Diamondbacks went ahead. He also blew a three run lead in Game 2 of the 2000 NL Division Series against the San Francisco Giants, surrendering a game tying three run homer to JT Snow. He would also surrender the lead in Game 1 of the 2000 World Series to the New York Yankees, as the Yankees would eventually prevail in a marathon extra-inning game, ultimately winning the series in 5 games. Despite these struggles during his four seasons in New York, he managed to establish himself as one of the Major Leagues' better closers, saving 139 games. But it was also a painful time for Ben√≠tez, who battled gout during the 2000 season, due to overindulging in shellfish. However, as Ben√≠tez still struggled to hold leads when it seemed to matter most, to many fans his failures in clutch situations overshadowed most of the success he had in his career in New York. Regardless, several playoff contenders were interested in his services. Midway through , as Ben√≠tez labored trying to convert saves through the year, he was traded to the New York Yankees, who intended to use him as a setup man for Mariano Rivera. =New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, and Florida Marlins= Ben√≠tez had a 1.93 ERA, but allowed 14 baserunners in 9.1 innings over nine games with the Yankees before being traded in a post-deadline waiver dealhttp://articles.courant.com/2003-08-07/sports/0308072607_1_setup-man-jeff- nelson-yankees-manager-joe-torre-yankees-gm-brian-cashman to the Seattle Mariners for Jeff Nelson. Benitez finished the 2003 season in Seattle. In , Ben√≠tez once again became a closer, taking a pay cut to join the Florida Marlins for one year. His season with the Marlins ended up being his best season to date; he saved 47 games in 51 chances and compiled a 1.29 ERA. In fact, after giving up a solo home run in his first game of the season, he did not allow another earned run until June 5, an impressive streak of 30 scoreless innings. After the season, Ben√≠tez elected to become a free agent, signing a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants that was worth a reported US$21 million. =San Francisco Giants= His tenure with the Giants was mired by injuries and a high percentage of blown saves, never recapturing the form he showed in 2004 with the Marlins. His first season with the Giants started badly when Ben√≠tez tore a pair of tendons in his right hamstring while running to cover first in late April. The injury had him sidelined until August, when he returned to the mound after a difficult rehab. Ben√≠tez struggled for much of the season, at one point blowing three consecutive save opportunities. Ben√≠tez's season ended prematurely after being placed on the 60-day disabled list with arthritis in both knees. He ended the season with 17 saves in 25 opportunities. Ben√≠tez started well, converting all of his first seven save opportunities. However, in May, Ben√≠tez picked up two blown saves and three losses, including a blown save and a loss against his former team, the Mets, where he committed two balks. This game immediately brought back memories of his various meltdowns on the mound as a Met, and the media pounced on it. After the game Ben√≠tez commented, \\"I didn't do my job\\", contrasting with his previous game where he picked up the loss yet claimed, \\"I did my job.\\" MLB.com writer Chris Haft reported that this added \\"little to the family atmosphere\\" at the Giants ballclub. Ben√≠tez had once before said, \\"I did my job\\", even when tallying a blown save, during a Giants loss to the Nationals in 2006. On May 31, 2007, he was traded back to the Florida Marlins in exchange for Randy Messenger. Giants general manager Brian Sabean acknowledged that Ben√≠tez was not liked by the Giants fanbase, saying he had become a \\"whipping boy\\", adding \\"the fans, the press and maybe some people in the clubhouse felt he needed to go\\". Chris Haft noted that Ben√≠tez had \\"incurred the wrath of San Francisco fans with his perceived attitude as well as his performance\\", further writing \\"he maintained his tendency to shrug off accountability for poor performances, prompting the crowds at AT&T; Park to boo him after the slightest lapse.\\" =Return to the Marlins, then onto the Toronto Blue Jays= Ben√≠tez's first return to AT&T; Park after being traded to the Marlins came on July 29, 2007. He was greeted with \\"thunderous boos\\" from the Giants fans. On October 29, 2007, Ben√≠tez officially filed for free agency, ending his second tenure with the Marlins following a disappointing campaign where he posted a 5.36 ERA between the two teams and did not record a save following the trade. On March 11, 2008, Ben√≠tez agreed to a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays and was given chance to compete for a bullpen job in spring training. After starting the season in the minors, he was eventually added to the active roster in May. However, after posting a 5.68 ERA, he was designated for assignment on June 7, and released. =Later career= Benitez started the 2009 season with the Newark Bears, an Independent League team in the Atlantic League, before signing a minor league contract with the Houston Astros on August 22, and was assigned to their triple-A affiliate the Round Rock Express. On his minor league return, Benitez gave up back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs against Memphis Redbirds hitters. On June 24, 2010 Benitez signed a minor league deal with the Florida Marlins and was assigned to their triple-A affiliate, New Orleans Zephyrs. Benitez was released on July 15 and immediately signed to play his second stint with the Newark Bears. Following the season, he became a free agent. In May 2011 Armando signed to play for the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Independent Baseball. On May 24, 2012 Benitez signed with the Atlantic League's Long Island Ducks. They are not affiliated with Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball.

Early life Jaime Hernandez grew up in Oxnard, California.Aldama, p. 119. He is the youngest of his family, with four older brothers and one sister. His family embraced comics: their mother read them frequently and old issues were kept in large quantities in the house, to be read and re-read by all over the years. \\"We grew up with comics,\\" Hernandez said. \\"I wanted to draw comics my whole life.\\"Aldama, p. 120. They read all types of comics and enjoyed those that gave a fairly realistic depiction of family life as well as the standard superhero adventures. Hernandez was particularly influenced by Hank Ketcham's Dennis the Menace and Dan DeCarlo's Archie' comics. The children in his otherwise rather realistic stories are often drawn to resemble Ketcham's, and Jaime's characters often strike very \\"DeCarlo-esque\\" poses. The work of Alex Toth, Charles Schulz, Jesse Marsh and Jack Kirby were also hugely influential. Hernandez has a lifelong fascination with pro wrestling, especially women's wrestling, and it has been a regular part of his work. Hernandez has also been a lifelong punk rock fan. In addition to playing in bands himself it has been a constant element of his work. His heroine Maggie and her friends are almost all punk fans; he also has done a series of stories about the career of another main character (Hopey) as a bass player for a luckless punk band. Career Love and Rockets #31 by Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez, 1989, Fantagraphics Books. Cover illustration by Jaime Hernandez depicting his two main characters, Maggie (right) and Hopey. Jaime's main contribution to Love and Rockets is the ongoing serial narrative Locas which follows the tangled lives of a group of primarily Latina characters, from their teenage years in the early days of the California punk scene to the present day. The two central characters of Jaime's cast are Margarita Luisa \\"Maggie\\" Chascarrillo and Esperanza Leticia \\"Hopey\\" Glass, whose on-again, off-again, open romance is a focus for many Locas storylines. Early on, the stories switched back and forth between Maggie's sci-fi adventures journeying around the world and working as a \\"prosolar\\" mechanic repairing rocketships, and much more realistic stories of Maggie and her friends in a grungy, mostly Latin California neighborhood known as \\"Hoppers\\". Eventually Hernandez dropped almost all of the sci-fi elements, although he does still occasionally include references to the earlier stories and he still does very occasional short stories about superheroines, robots and other sci-fi genre elements. The Hernandez brothers announced they were ending Love and Rockets with issue 50, and that they would be doing solo books from then on. For the next few years, the brothers released many solo books, with Jaime doing several books featuring his Locas characters (including Whoa Nellie, Penny Century, and Maggie and Hopey Color Fun) and Maggie generally occupying a supporting role. Eventually they resumed doing Love and Rockets and Maggie again took center stage, but instead of the large, magazine-style format of the original issues, the book was now released in a more traditional comic book format. The entire Locas storyline to date was collected into one 700 page graphic novel in 2004. Hernandez has been praised for the physical beauty of his female characters as well as their complex personalities, and for years he struggled to create comparably nuanced male characters. Hernandez has often said that Maggie and Ray Dominguez both represent different aspects of his own personality. In an interview with The Comics Journal, Hernandez admitted he'd had difficulty aging his characters, because while he'd known girls like Maggie and Hopey when he was young, he'd never known them long enough to find out what they did in adulthood. =Other work= In addition to his Locas stories, Hernandez has also done occasional work for DC Comics and The New Yorker, and he has done many album covers for such artists as Michelle Shocked. Earlier in his career Hernandez also did album covers for some \\"Nardcore\\" punk bands, such as Ill Repute and Dr. Know, the latter of whom featured his younger brother Ismael on bass. Hernandez contributed his artwork for the Indigo Girls' 2004 album All That We Let In. In September 2006, Hernandez also created the artwork for the critically acclaimed Los Lobos album The Town and the City. In 1984-85 Gilbert, Mario and Jaime collaborated on Mister X, a sci-fi comic book series from Vortex Press, with Jaime handling the art and Gilbert and Mario plotting. The book's noirish look has been cited as an influence by the creators of Batman: The Animated Series among other retro-futuristic works. The Hernandez brothers themselves hold little affection for it, however, with Gilbert once describing it being \\"like a bad zit... it just sort of happened.\\" The Hernandez brothers left the book when Vortex failed to pay them in full.\\"Hernandez Brothers Leave Mister X Over Payment Dispute,\\" The Comics Journal #101 (August 1985), pp. 19-20. Responding to the non-payment accusations, publisher Bill Marks said \\"I don't dispute that one bit. And they'll be paid every nickel of it, or every quarter of it.\\" The Hernandez brothers were indeed ultimately paid for their work on Mister X in 1988.\\"Hernandez Brothers Paid,\\" The Comics Journal #122 (June 1988), p. 22. In 2006, Publishers Weekly ranked Hernandez' work Ghost of Hoppers second on its critics' poll of the best comic books of 2006.

It is one of the largest of all monkeys. Located primarily in southern Africa, the chacma baboon has a wide variety of social behaviors, including a dominance hierarchy, collective foraging, adoption of young by females, and friendship pairings. These behaviors form parts of a complex evolutionary ecology. In general, the species is not threatened, but human population pressure has increased contact between humans and baboons. Hunting, trapping, and accidents kill or remove many baboons from the wild, thereby reducing baboon numbers and disrupting their social structure. Taxonomy Due to hybridization between different baboon (Papio) populations across Africa, authors have occasionally grouped the entire radiation as a single species, the hamadryas baboon, Papio hamadryas. Arbitrary boundaries were then used to separate the populations into subspecies. Other authors once considered the chacma baboon a subspecies of the yellow baboon, Papio cynocephalus, although it is now recognised as a separate species, Papio ursinus. The chacma baboon has two or three subspecies, depending on which classification is followed. Grubb et al. (2003) lists two subspecies, while Groves (2005) in Mammal Species of the World listed three. This article follows Groves (2005) and describes three distinct subspecies. In the Grubb et al. (2003) paper, P. u. raucana was believed to be synonymous with P. u. ursinus. * Papio ursinus ursinus Kerr, 1792 ‚Äì Cape chacma (found in southern South Africa) * P. ursinus griseipes Pocock, 1911 ‚Äì Gray-footed chacma (found in northern South Africa to southern Zambia) * P. ursinus raucana Shortridge, 1942 ‚Äì Ruacana chacma (found from Namibia to southern Angola, but not accepted by all authorities as distinct.

It also one of the heaviest; the male weighs from with an average of . Baboons are sexually dimorphic, and females are considerably smaller than males. The female chacma weighs from , with an average of .Kingdon, J., Happold, D., Butynski, T., Hoffmann, M., Happold, M., & Kalina, J. (2013). Mammals of Africa (Vol. 1). A&C; Black.Coid, C., Poilecot, P., & de Zborowski, I. (2002). Les hommes et les animaux dans la moyenne vall√©e du Zamb√®ze, Zimbabwe. Editions Quae. It is similar in size to the olive baboon, averaging slightly higher in mean body mass, and of similar weight to the more compact mandrill, the males of which weigh on average about more than a chacma baboon, the females weigh less than the female chacma. While the mandrill is usually crowned the largest of all modern monkeys, going on total length and average (but not maximum) body weight between the sexes, the chacma baboon appears to be the largest extant monkey. The chacma baboon is generally dark brown to gray in color, with a patch of rough hair on the nape of its neck. Unlike the males of northern baboon species (the Guinea, hamadryas, and olive baboons), chacma males do not have a mane. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this baboon is its long, downward-sloping face. The canine teeth of male chacma baboons have a mean length of at the time they emigrate from their natal troop. This is the time of greatest tooth length as the teeth tend to wear or be broken thereafter. The three subspecies are differentiated by size and color. The Cape chacma is a large, heavy, dark-brown, and has black feet. The gray-footed chacma is slightly smaller than the Cape chacma, lighter in color and build, and has gray feet. The Ruacana chacma generally appears to be a smaller, less darkly colored version of the Cape chacma. Ecology Trapped up tree by Kalahari lions Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa =Habitat and distribution= The chacma baboon inhabits a wide array of habitats including woodland, savanna, steppes, and sub desert, from the grassy alpine slopes of the Drakensberg to the Kalahari desert. During the night, the chacma baboon sleeps atop steep hills, high cliffs or rocks or in large trees, away from nocturnal predators. In daytime, water availability may limit its range in arid areas. It is found throughout southern Africa, ranging from South Africa north to Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique. The subspecies are divided across this range. The Cape chacma is found in southern South Africa; the gray-footed chacma, is present from northern South Africa, through the Okavango Delta in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique (south of the Zambezi), to southwest Zambia; and the Ruacana chacma is found in northern Namibia and southern Angola. =Diet= The chacma baboon is an omnivorous highly opportunistic feeder, and will eat practically anything; typical foods include fruits, seeds, grass, blossoms, bulbs, bark, insects, spiders, worms, rodents, birds, small antelope and fungi (the desert truffle Kalaharituber pfeilii). Chacma baboon diet is thought to contain about 2 percent animal-sourced food, most of which consists of invertebrates; proportions vary between populations. Baboons are considered vermin by most African farmers due to their foraging of cultivated crops and livestock. At the Cape of Good Hope in particular, chacma baboons are also known for taking shellfish and other small marine invertebrates. It is generally a scavenger when it comes to game meat, and rarely engages in hunting larger animals. One incident of a chacma baboon killing a human infant has been reported, but the event is so rare, the locals believed it was due to witchcraft. Normally, wild chacma baboons will flee at the approach of humans, though this is changing due to the easy availability of food and garbage from human dwellings in villages and towns near the baboons habitat. =Predation= Despite their formidable nature and large size, chacma baboons are vulnerable to a variety of predators.Nowak, R. (1999). Walker's Mammals of the World, Sixth Edition. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Undoubtedly the main predator of adult chacma baboons overall is the leopard.Cowlishaw, G. (1994). Vulnerability to predation in baboon populations. Behaviour, 131(3-4), 293-304.Noser, R., & Byrne, R. W. (2007). Travel routes and planning of visits to out-of-sight resources in wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. Animal Behaviour, 73(2), 257-266. In the Waterberg Biosphere, chacma baboon comprised 20.2% of leopard kills and 18.7% of the leopard's prey biomass.Jooste, E., Pitman, R. T., Van Hoven, W., & Swanepoel, L. H. (2012). Unusually high predation on chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) by female leopards (Panthera pardus) in the Waterberg Mountains, South Africa. Folia Primatologica, 83(3-6), 353-360. Although previously little documented, the African wild dog, a predator of similar or even slightly inferior size to male baboons themselves, in Mana Pools National Park (Zimbabwe) took to chacma baboons as their main prey, comprising 44% of 118 kills.van der Meer, E., Lyon, N., Mutonhori, T., Mandisodza-Chikerema, R., & Blinston, P. (2019). Dangerous game: preferential predation on baboons by African wild dogs in Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe. Behaviour, 156(1), 37-58. Less routine predation on chacma baboons has been reportedly committed by lions, spotted hyena, Nile crocodiles and African rock pythons (in rough descending likelihood of threat).Owen‚ÄêSmith, N., & Mills, M. G. (2008). Predator‚Äìprey size relationships in an African large‚Äêmammal food web. Journal of Animal Ecology, 77(1), 173-183.Cheney, D., & Wrangham, R. (1987). Predation. Pp. 227-239 in B Smuts, D Cheney, R Seyfarth, R Wranghams, T Struhsaker, eds. Primate Societies. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.Cheney, D. L., Seyfarth, R. M., Fischer, J., Beehner, J., Bergman, T., Johnson, S. E., & Silk, J. B. (2004). Factors affecting reproduction and mortality among baboons in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. International Journal of Primatology, 25(2), 401-428. The predators of young chacma baboons are probably even more diverse but poorly-documented. It is documented that Verreaux's eagles and martial eagles have taken young chacma baboons and probable or possible predation has been committed by other eagles: crowned eagles and tawny eagles.Gargett, V., Mundy, P. J., & Arnott, G. (1990). The Black Eagle: A Study: Verreaux's Eagle in Southern Africa. Academic.Naude, V. N., Smyth, L. K., Weideman, E. A., Krochuk, B. A., & Amar, A. (2019). Using web-sourced photography to explore the diet of a declining African raptor, the Martial Eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus). The Condor: Ornithological Applications, 121(1), duy015. When approaching potentially dangerous sites such as watering holes, more vulnerable members of the chacma baboon group may travel near the rear of the group but may conversely end up by the front of group out of fear if a predator approaches.Rhine, R. J., & Tilson, R. (1987). ;;Reactions to fear as a proximate factor in the sociospatial organization of baboon progressions;;. American Journal of Primatology, 13(2), 119-128. The adult male chacma baboon has a fearsome defense and may assault their predators with their large, sharp canine teeth, which can at least seriously injure predators as formidable as leopards, and (despite being far from exemption from predation) the adult males tend to be the least vulnerable members of the baboon troops. As in other monkeys, the larger, more formidable male baboons may successfully defend more vulnerable members of the troop via attacking predators if they come into sight.Melnick, D. & Pearl, M. (1987). Cercopithecines in multimale groups: Genetic diversity and population structure. Pp. 121-134 in B Smuts, D Cheney, R Seyfarth, R Wrangham, T Struhsaker, eds. Primate Societies. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. Behavior =Social organization= The chacma baboon usually lives in social groups, called troops, which are composed of multiple adult males, adult females, and their offspring. Occasionally, however, very small groups form that consist of only a single adult male and several adult females. Chacma troops are characterized by a dominance hierarchy. Female ranking within the troop is inherited through the mother and remains relatively fixed, while the male ranking is often in flux, especially when the dominant male is replaced. Chacmas are unusual among baboons in that neither males nor females form strong relationships with members of the same sex. Instead, the strongest social bonds are often between unrelated adult males and females. Infanticide is much more common among Chacmas compared to most other baboon species, as newly dominant males will often kill infants or young baboons sired by the previously dominant male. Baboon troops possess a complex group behavior and communicate by means of body attitudes, facial expressions, vocalizations and touch. =Morning dispersal patterns= The chacma baboon often sleeps in large groups on high rocks, cliffs or in tall trees at night to avoid nocturnal predators. The morning dispersal from the sleeping site is synchronized, with all members leaving at the same time. In most cases, dispersal is initiated by a single individual, and the other members of the group decide whether or not to follow. At least five followers must be recruited for a successful dispersal initiation, and not all initiation attempts are successful. Surprisingly, the initiator's dominance status shows little correlation with successful initiation of departure; more-dominant individuals are no more likely to lead a successful departure than subordinate individuals. One study has shown that while the success rate of dispersal initiation attempts is relatively constant across all sexes, male are more likely to attempt initiation than females, and lactating females are less likely to attempt initiation than females without dependent offspring. A separate study has achieved slightly different results. While the dominance hierarchy does not play a significant role in initiating the morning dispersal, social affiliation does. Chacma baboons that play a more central role in the group (as measured by grooming behavior and time spent with other members) are more likely to be followed during the morning dispersal. This study concluded that group members are more likely to follow the behavior of individuals with which they are closely affiliated. =Foraging behavior= Chacma baboons have been observed to adopt orphaned young Dominance does play a role in group foraging decisions. A dominant individual (usually the alpha male) leads the group to easily monopolized resources. The group usually follows, even though many subordinate members cannot gain access to that particular resource. As in morning dispersal, the inclination of group members to follow the leader is positively associated with social interactions with that dominant individual. Collective foraging behavior, with many individuals taking advantage of the same resource at once, has also been observed. However, this behavior can be chiefly attributed to shared dietary needs rather than social affiliation. Pregnant females, who share similar dietary needs, are more likely to synchronize their behavior than fertile females. Foraging synchronization decreases in areas with lower food density. =Adoption= Adoption behavior has been observed in chacma baboons. Orphaned baboons whose mothers have disappeared or died are often too small to care for themselves. In one study of nine natural orphans and three introduced orphans, all but one orphan were adopted by another member of the group. The individual that was not adopted was 16 months old, four months older than the next oldest orphan, and was old enough to survive on its own. Adoption behavior includes sleeping close to the orphaned infant, grooming and carrying the orphan, and protecting it from harassment by other members of the troop. Both males and females care for infants, and care does not depend on the infant's sex. Additionally, all caregivers are pre-reproductive, only four or five years of age. The two major theories explaining this behavior are kin selection, in which caregivers take care of potentially related orphans, and parental practice, in which young caregivers increase their own fitness by using an orphan to practice their own parental skills. =Friendship= Chacma baboons mating at Cape Point in South Africa Males and female chacma baboons often form relationships referred to as \\"friendships\\". These cooperative relationships generally occur between lactating females and adult males. The females are believed to seek out male friendships to gain protection from infanticide. In many baboon species, immigrant alpha males often practice infanticide upon arrival in a new troop. By killing unrelated infants, the new male shortens the time until he can mate with the females of the troop. A female with dependent offspring generally does not become sexually receptive until she weans her offspring at around 12 months of age. However, a mother usually becomes sexually receptive shortly after the death of her offspring. Grooming strengthens bonds between individuals in groups This protection hypothesis is supported by studies of stress hormones in female baboons during changes in the male hierarchy. When an immigrant male ascends to the top of the male dominance hierarchy, stress hormones in lactating and pregnant females increases, while stress hormones in females not at risk of infanticide stay the same. Additionally, females in friendships with males exhibit a smaller rise in stress hormones than do females without male friends. The benefits of friendship to males are less clear. A male is more likely to enter into friendships with females with which he has mated, which indicates males might enter into friendships to protect their own offspring and not just to protect that female's future reproductive success. These friendships may play a role in the mating system of chacma baboons. A female will often mate with several males, which increases the number of potential fathers for her offspring and increases the chances she will be able to find at least one friend willing to protect her infants and assist in caring for them. Female chacma baboons have been observed to compete with each other for male friends. This may be the result of one male having a high probability of paternity with multiple females. These competitions are heavily influenced by the female dominance hierarchy, with dominant females displacing subordinate females in friendships with males. Generally, when a more-dominant female attempts to make friends with an individual which is already the friend of a subordinate female, the subordinate female reduces grooming and spatial proximity to that male, potentially leaving her offspring at higher risk of infanticide. Relationship with humans =Conservation= The chacma baboon is widespread and does not rank among threatened animal species. However, in some confined locations, such as South Africa's Southern Cape Peninsula, local populations are dwindling due to habitat loss and predation from other protected species, such as leopards and lions. Many troops have become a suburban menace in their search for food, overturning garbage cans, and literally breaking into cars and houses where they cause much damage. These troops can be dangerous and aggressive, and they will even steal food directly from people. These negative encounters have resulted in the baboons being hunted and poisoned by frustrated local residents. This isolated population is thought to face extinction within 10 years. Chacma baboons live in proximity to humans and are frequently killed as vermin The chacma is listed under Appendix II of CITES as it occurs in many protected areas across its range. The only area in South Africa where they are monitored is in the Cape Peninsula, where they are protected. Observations by those working hands-on in South Africa's rehabilitation centers have found this species is damaged by human intervention; troop structures are influenced, and over the years a significant loss in numbers has occurred. Because they live near and invade human habitats, baboons are regularly shot, poisoned, electrocuted, beaten, run over, and captured for the pet industry, research laboratories and muthi (medicine). Despite this, assessors working for the IUCN believe there are no major threats that could result in a range-wide decline of the species.

The screenplay by Bo Goldman was inspired by real-life Utah service station owner Melvin Dummar, who was listed as the beneficiary of $156 million in a will allegedly handwritten by Howard Hughes that was discovered in the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City. A novelization of Goldman's script later was written by George Gipe. The film starred Paul Le Mat, Jason Robards, and, in an Academy Award-winning performance, Mary Steenburgen. Plot In the opening scene, Howard Hughes loses control of his motorcycle and crashes in the Nevada desert. That night, he is discovered lying on the side of a stretch of U.S. Highway 95 when Melvin Dummar stops his pickup truck so he can relieve himself. The disheveled stranger, refusing to allow Melvin to take him to the hospital, asks him to instead drive him to Las Vegas, Nevada. En route, the two engage in stilted conversation until Dummar cajoles his passenger into joining him in singing a Christmas song he wrote. Hughes then suggests they sing his favorite song \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\", and they do. The man warms to his rescuer and he is dropped off at the Desert Inn (which Hughes owns and therein resides) without revealing his identity as the reclusive billionaire. Most of the remainder of the film focuses on Melvin's scattered, up-and-down life, his spendthrift, trust-in-luck nature, his rocky marital life with first wife Lynda, and his more stable relationship with second wife Bonnie. Lynda leaves him and their daughter to dance in a sleazy strip club, but eventually returns, but she remains frustrated by her husband's futile efforts to achieve the American dream. Melvin convinces her to appear on Easy Street, a game show hybrid of The Gong Show and Let's Make a Deal, and although her tap dancing initially is booed by the audience, she wins them over and nabs the top prize of living room furniture, a piano, and $10,000 cash. Melvin agrees to invest in an affordable house in a new development, but while Lynda tries to keep their finances under control, he rashly buys a new Cadillac Eldorado and a boat, prompting her to take their daughter and toddler son and sue for divorce. Melvin is comforted by Bonnie, the payroll clerk at the dairy where he drives a truck, and the two eventually wed and move to Utah, where they take over the operation of a service station her relatives had owned. One day, a mysterious man in a limousine stops at the station ostensibly to buy a pack of cigarettes, but after he drives off Melvin discovers an envelope marked \\"Last Will and Testament of Howard Hughes\\" on his office desk. Afraid to open it, he takes it to Mormon headquarters and secrets it in a pile of incoming mail. It doesn't take long for the media to descend upon him and his family, and eventually Melvin finds himself in court, admitting he once met Hughes but vigorously denying he forged the will that finally fulfills his dreams.

Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the film a \\"sharp, engaging, very funny, anxious comedy\\" and commented, \\"Mr. Demme is a lyrical film maker for whom there is purpose in style...Melvin and Howard is commercial American movie- making of a most expansive, entertaining kind.\\"Canby, Vincent.

It is a world of mobile homes, Pop Tarts, dust, kids and dreams of glory. It's pretty clear how this movie got made. Hollywood started with the notion that the story of the mysterious Hughes will might make a good courtroom thriller. Well, maybe it would have. But my hunch is that when they met Dummar, they had the good sense to realize that they could get a better ‚Äì and certainly a funnier ‚Äì story out of what happened to him between the day he met Hughes and the day the will was discovered.

Jonathan was born to a Quaker (Religious Society of Friends) family in Newport, Rhode Island. He was first elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1776. In 1777 and early 1778 he served as paymaster of the Rhode Island regiment of the Continental Army. In 1778, he re-entered the Assembly, serving there until 1786. In 1786 and 1787, Rhode Island‚Äôs assembly appointed him as delegate to the Continental Congress. After that, he returned to assembly (serving until 1805), where he became a leader of the anti-federalist Country Party. Hazard was a delegate to the state's ratifying convention that considered the U.S. Constitution in 1789. His active opposition was one of the reasons that the convention adjourned without a vote. By the following spring, he at least chose to remain silent as the Assembly voted in favor of ratification on May 29, 1790. That marked the start of a steady decline in his political influence. In 1805 Jonathan, along with his wife, Patience, and their younger children, moved west to a new settlement that was being established by the Society of Friends (Quakers) in Oneida County, New York. According to his tombstone photograph at Find A Grave, he was born in 1731 and died on 29 July 1812.

Watercraft On watercraft, a sponson is a projection that extends outward (usually from the hull, but sometimes other parts of the vessel) to improve stability while floating, or to act as a securing point for other equipment. Vessels with unstable body shapes or unevenly distributed weight are likely to feature sponsons to help prevent capsizing or other instabilities. On many vessels, these projections from the main body of the vessel can be attached and removed quickly and fairly easily. Canoes and kayaks sometimes feature sponson attachments as well, for stability in rough waters. These differ from outriggers, which extend a significant distance away from the body of the craft, and are employed on craft designed for open waters. A sponson's terminus is close to the craft, thereby allowing the boat to maneuver through more narrow spaces, and so is more likely to be used on smaller craft that still require maneuverability through narrow passages. In the mid-1990s, advances in sponson design made sponsons a tool for better handling at high speeds, and they began being added to racing boats. There are essentially three types of sponsons for watercraft available on the market today‚Äîthe basic block type, the hooked or winged type, and the paddle or rudder type. =Block sponsons= The block type is the simplest type. The leading end is usually rounded or pointed for reduced drag. \\"Its main function is to provide additional lift on the back of the hull, mostly during acceleration. It can also help provide better side-to- side stability at speed and reduce porpoising by providing a bit more hull surface at the rear of the craft.\\" =Winged/hooked sponsons= Winged or hooked sponsons are the most common type. In addition to added lift during acceleration, better side-to-side stability, and reduced porpoising, they provide improved handling. \\"The outside edge provides grip in turns, allowing you to turn sharper and faster without fear of the back end sliding out. They can also provide a pivot point for the hull in turns.\\" One of the most overlooked benefits of this type of sponson is that riders can lean into turns more, making watercraft easier to push to their limits. =Paddle/rudder sponsons= Paddle or rudder-type sponsons, which use a flat paddle-shaped rudder attached vertically to a block-type sponson, do essentially the same thing, but the effect can be even more dramatic, because the flat paddle or rudder portion of the sponson provides a sharper and more pronounced edge to catch the water. Aircraft MH-53 Sea Dragon helicopter with massive sponsons below the engines On flying boats‚Äîas first patented by Claudius Dornier and first used on the Kaiserliche Marines German World War I flying boat, the Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.IV‚Äîa sponson can help extend the hull higher in the water, reducing drag and providing additional lift when the plane is taking off. Helicopters may also feature one or more sponsons, and though most helicopters are not designed to land in or take off from water, these safety features are important should the aircraft crash land in water. Sponsons on a helicopter can also store fuel or landing gear, e.g., Sikorsky S-92 and Bell 222. When mounted on aircraft, they must be adjusted properly for aerodynamics when the aircraft is in flight; if they are not adjusted properly, the aircraft might become unstable or damage to the aircraft might occur. Military The sponson-mounted main gun of an M3 Lee tank On land vessels, such as tanks or other military vehicles, and on naval warships, a sponson may refer to a mounting or enclosure projecting from the side or top of the structure/hull that is not used for buoyancy, but for armaments such as machine guns, or for purposes of visibility. It can be used for storage as well as a transport platform for people entering or leaving the vehicle. It may also provide layers of bulletproof protection and storage space, as found over the tracks of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

Capsizing or keeling over occurs when a boat or ship is turned on its side or it is upside down in the water. The act of reversing a capsized vessel is called righting. If a capsized vessel has enough flotation to prevent sinking, it may recover on its own in changing conditions or through mechanical work if it is not stable inverted. Vessels of this design are called self-righting. Small vessels Laser sailing dinghy by standing on the daggerboard In dinghy sailing, a practical distinction can be made between being knocked down (to 90 degrees) which is called a capsize, and being inverted, which is called being turtled. Small dinghies frequently capsize in the normal course of use and can usually be recovered by the crew. Some types of dinghy are occasionally deliberately capsized, as capsizing and righting the vessel again can be the fastest means of draining water from the boat. Capsizing (but not necessarily turtling) is an inherent part of dinghy sailing. It is not a question of \\"if\\" but a question of \\"when\\". For those who do not want the experience, a keelboat monohull has physics on its side. But even yachts can capsize and turtle in extraordinary conditions, so design considerations are important. Such events can overcome skill and experience; boats need to be appropriate for foreseeable conditions. A kayak roll, after intentional capsizing A capsized kayak may be righted with a roll or eskimo rescue. As long as the kayaker knows how to react, the water is not too shallow, and the location is not close to dangers that require evasive action by the kayaker ‚Äì which cannot be taken while capsized ‚Äì capsizing itself is usually not considered dangerous. In whitewater kayaking, capsizing occurs frequently and is accepted as an ordinary part of the sport. Sailing vessels' \\"capsize ratio\\" is commonly published as a guideline for zones of safe operation -- less than 2.0 means as a rule-of-thumb suitability for offshore navigation. However its crude nature of displacement divided by a vessel's beam (breadth) (albeit with a constant multiplied to provide an average assessment), means thorough assessment of ship stability, immersibility and buoyancy involves other factors to address the relevant risks posed by waves, tides, weather and occurrences such as damage and collision. Large vessels In a storm, even large vessels may be rolled by being hit broadside by a large wave or swell or \\"pitch poled\\" stem over stern in extreme waves. This is normally catastrophic for larger ships, and smaller yachts can be dismasted (i.e., lose their masts and rigging) due to the drag as the boat is forced to roll over. A ship that sustains a hole or crack ('is holed') may capsize.The Telegraph: The EU ignored years of expert warnings on cruise ship safety. Discussion of stability when large modern ships are holed This is the working of torpedo and naval mine warfare. In 2012 the very large cruise ship ' was holed and lost her propulsion by a mapped rock near the shallows, and drifted further where she partially sank, resting towards one side with most of her structure out of the water. This was not a capsize as her bottom was only partly exposed; rather this was a partial sinking. Fixing a hole is called plugging. Otherwise a vessel in largely upright position which capsizes has suffered too much water to enter in places normally above the waterline, and which may be caused by poor manoeuvering, overloading (see Plimsoll Line) or poor weather. As for holes, bailing may be carried out - removal of water aboard such as with a bilge pump, self or hand bailer or buckets. At the stage of sinking where its buoyancy is deemed critical, the ship is unlikely to upright nor able to right itself such that stability and safety will be compromised even if the vessel is righted -- a decision is made to abandon ship and any ultimate salvage may entail firm grounding and re-buoyancy pumps. Among ship types, a roll-on-roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ship is more prone to capsizing as it has large open car decks near the waterline. If the watertight car-deck doors fail through damage or mismanagement (as in the partial sinking of where the doors were accidentally left open), and one of the largest peacetime maritime disasters when MS Estonia sank off of the Archipelago Sea in Finland, water entering the car- deck is subject to the free surface effect and may cause a capsize. As a RORO ferry rolls, vehicles can break free and slide down if not firmly secured, adversely altering the ship's centre of gravity, accelerating the roll, and possibly turning an otherwise recoverable roll into a capsize.  Competition  A team at the 2005 ISAF Team Racing World Championship narrowly avoids capsizing. In competitive yacht racing, a capsized boat has certain special rights as it cannot maneuver. A boat is deemed capsized when the mast is touching the water; when it is fully inverted, it is said to have turned turtle or turtled. Good racers can often recover from a capsize with minimal loss of time. The capsize can result from extreme broaching, especially if the keel has insufficient leverage to tilt the vessel upright. Motorlife boats are designed to be self-righting if capsized, but most other motorboats are not. Training Righting a capsized Hobie Cat Practice: righting a sailing dinghy after a deliberate capsize on Wroxham Broad Intermediate sailors are encouraged to capsize their dinghies in a safe location with supervision at least once to become acquainted with their boat's floating properties and the capsize process. The boat is then righted, bailed out, and the sails reset, so that in the event of an uncontrolled capsize, the boat and its occupants are familiar with the procedure and may recover. Most small monohull sailboats can normally be righted by standing or pulling down on the centreboard, daggerboard (or bilgeboard in a scow) to lift the mast clear of the water. Depending on the design of the hull, the boat's righting moment will normally take effect once the mast is around 30 degrees from horizontal and help pull the boat vertical. Righting a catamaran that is lying on its side involves using a righting line fed over the upper hull. The crew stands on the lower hull and pulls back on the righting line. In small catamarans such as the Hobie 16 it is imperative that at least one crew member assumes this task as soon as possible as there is a chance that the boat will turtle and then become extremely difficult to recover without assistance. Some monohulls and catamarans use a small flotation device mounted at the tip of the mast or mainsail to ensure that the craft cannot assume an inverted position, or at least that a fully inverted position is not stable (i.e. it would come to a position where the mast is lying on the surface of the water, which would be preferable to fully inverted). In both cases, having a crew member lift the end of the mast out of the water may help speed the process, as the greatest challenge of righting a capsized boat is shedding the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up water as the sail lifts out of the water. The bow of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts to lift out of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat. Care is taken not to let the boat swing all the way over and capsize on the other side, frequently with the crew on the bottom. This is more likely if the boat is not pointed into the wind.  Prevention  There is a wide range of technology that can be installed or strategically placed to prevent or deter a boat or ship from capsizing. The various technologies rely on inflating airbags also known as lift bags which increasing the vessel's buoyancy with the water. = Yachts = Capsizing in yachts can occur when water is able to infiltrate the hull and decrease the vessels water and buoyancy leading to capsizing. Yachts can be deployed with a flotation system which is a series of strategically placed lift bags within the interior of the hull increasing the vessel's buoyancy and filling void space where water can collect, providing valuable time to remove the water, fix damage or evacuate. = Large ships = When larger ships such as cargo ships and tankers capsize or sink not only is recovery not possible but great environment damage can occur from spillage of cargo. Larger ships are being equipped with Surfacing System for Ship Recovery which is an inflatable device that is installed in the ballast water tank or within the hull of the vessel and can be deployed within seconds of an accident to stabilize the vessel and give more time for rescue and evacuation.

File:Northumberland model lifeboat.JPGThe Beeching-Peake SR (self-righting) lifeboat won an 1851 competition for improved lifeboat design. Drawings show large, high buoyancy tanks, and ballast. File:RNLI Chatham Lizzie Porter Holy Island 8352.JPGThe Lizzie Porter is a Peake-class lifeboat, an early design of self-righting boat. Note the high, rounded buoyancy tanks at her bow and stern, and low sides amidships. A vessel may be designated as \\"self-righting\\" if it is designed to be able to capsize then return to upright without intervention (with or without crew on board). The angle of vanishing stability, the angle of heel at which a vessel becomes unstable and does not bob back upright, does not exist; a self-righting boat will return to upright from any position, including completely upside-down. A self-righting vessel must be positively buoyant when swamped. There are three methods of making a vessel self-right: careful distribution of stationary weight and buoyancy, inflatable airbags, and movable ballast. A basic tool for calculating a vessel's stability is a static stability diagram, which plots the angle of heel on the horizontal axis and the righting lever (GZ) on the vertical axis. (see metacentric height for details). If the static stability curve never crosses the x-axis, the boat is not stable upside-down. This is not sufficient to built a boat with good stability at sea, as it neglects the effects of wind, waves, and human occupants, but it is a simple, powerful way to analyze the stability of a vessel. Self-righting through distribution of weight and buoyancy requires the weight low-down, and the buoyancy high up. It is often accomplished with a self-sealing superstructure, such as the large deckhouses on modern rescue boats. Most small craft intended as lifeboats with rigid (rather than inflatable) hulls designed since about the middle of the twentieth century are self-righting. Small radio-controlled boats may also self-right. This is particularly useful for racing.

Maxwell played college basketball for the University of Florida, and led the Florida Gators to their first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. He was selected by the Denver Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Draft and was immediately traded to the San Antonio Spurs. His longest and most successful NBA tenure was with the Houston Rockets. The nickname \\"Mad Max\\" was bestowed upon Maxwell by color commentators for his clutch three-point shooting, which reached its pinnacle in the deciding game of the 1994 NBA Finals between Houston and New York. Maxwell is among just nine players in NBA history to amass 30 points in a single quarter, accomplishing that feat en route to a 51-point outing on January 26, 1991, against Cleveland. Early years Maxwell was born in Gainesville, Florida. He attended Buchholz High School in Gainesville, and played for the Buchholz Bobcats high school basketball team. As a senior, Maxwell was the Mr. Basketball of the state of Florida as well as being an all-state defensive back in football. College career Maxwell received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, where he played for coach Norm Sloan's Florida Gators men's basketball from 1984 to 1988. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 20.2 points as a senior and still holds 15 Gators team records. He left school after four years as the Gators' all-time leading scorer (2,450) and the No. 2 scorer in Southeastern Conference history behind LSU's Pete Maravich. He averaged more than 20 points in both his junior and senior seasons, although Florida would erase all the points Maxwell scored in those seasons due to Maxwell taking money from agents and accepting a free round-trip ticket to go to a basketball camp.1990 Florida infractions report NBA On June 28, 1988, Maxwell was drafted into the NBA by the Denver Nuggets, who traded him the same day to the San Antonio Spurs for a second-round pick the next year. Two years later, his contract was sold to the Houston Rockets, where he would become a key member of the franchise's first championship team in 1994. Known for his clutch shooting, Maxwell hit several game-winning shots throughout his career. Maxwell held the NBA's record for most 3-pointers made in a season from 1991 to 1993.https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_progress.html During the Houston Rockets' mid-1990s dynasty, Maxwell was viewed as the team's second man next to Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon. Maxwell was not a part of the Rockets' 1995 championship roster, quitting the team after a loss to Utah in the 1995 playoffs. Clyde Drexler, who Houston had acquired during the beginning of that season, had taken away most of Maxwell's minutes and his starting spot. The decision to quit the team is something that Maxwell has been said to regret; the decision would ruin his career, as he would then become an NBA journeyman for the remainder of his career. He was the last Rocket to wear #11 before Yao Ming. Maxwell spoke out against Magic Johnson's NBA comeback in 1996; Johnson had retired in 1991 after contracting HIV.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1996-03-31-9603310215-story.html Behavioral incidents * February 1995: In a game at Portland on February 6, he ran into the stands punching a fan due to the fan heckling him. The NBA suspended him for ten games and fined him $20,000. * April 1995: Feigning a hamstring injury, he was given a leave of absence after the first game of the playoffs. Maxwell later admitted he was frustrated with not playing; the incident was hyped as Maxwell being disgruntled at the team's recent acquisition of Hall-of-Fame guard Clyde Drexler. His actions led to the Rockets ending his tenure with them. * August 1995: Shortly after signing with Philadelphia, Maxwell was pulled over after he ran a red light. During a search, police found a bag of marijuana on the floor of the car. Maxwell pleaded no contest and posted a $25,000 appeal bond, but lost the appeal. Three years later, while Maxwell was playing for the Charlotte Hornets, a Texas judge issued a warrant for his arrest and he was extradited to Houston, where he served a 90-day sentence. * 2000: The Seattle SuperSonics fined Maxwell and Gary Payton for a locker-room brawl on March 26, that left two of their teammates, who tried to play peacemakers, hurt.

Many varying-sized road cases can be built to outfit the needs of an entire concert tour, or custom designed individually for a specific industry or product. The term road case is mostly used in the United States and implies that the case is primarily for road-based travel, unlike a flight case. The term originates from its use for storing and shipping band equipment while the musicians were on the road.  History  The history of flight case design is based on an airplane parts packaging specification. It was designed by airline packaging engineers. The specification is ATA 300 Category I. ATA is the A4A (Airlines for America) International, formerly the Air Transport Association of America located in Washington, D.C. and consists of members like Boeing, Airbus, FedEx, American, United, and JetBlue. ATA 300 Category I cases are designed to withstand a minimum of 100 round trips, Category II containers a minimum of 10 round trips, and Category III containers 1 round trip as defined to also include the return of a replacement part. Because of visibility requirements during nighttime airline operations, the recommended color of reusable cases is white, but the requirement is waived to permit a carrier's traditional or logo colors except for very dark colors. The first ATA 300 spec was published on August 1, 1960.  Construction  A large road case used to transport an audio multicore cable Most cases are fabricated from panels joined by metal or plastic extrusions, molded plastic, or metal. Fabricated cases are typically made from panels constructed of two layers. An outer layer of ABS or fiberglass laminate is adhered to a middle layer of lightweight cabinet-grade plywood such as birch, poplar, or maple. These two layers are known as laminate panel, and high-grade cases are made from composite material. Inside the case, an internal shock-absorbing filler such as polyurethane or polyethylene foam has cavities that correspond to the shape of the components it is preserving. Alternate shock protection methods include mounting the case contents to racks or panels attached to the case walls with shock isolators. The corners of fabricated cases are commonly reinforced with stamped sheet steel case corners commonly finished in zinc, nickel, chrome. The term ATA case is frequently used to describe cases that resemble those that comply with ATA Specification 300 category I or II, but have not been certified by the independent testing defined in ATA Specification 300. Category I and II cases are required to be tested both as a pre-production prototype and as a sample selected from the first production lot. Tests include stackability, drop or impact, water resistance, vibration (category I only), and penetration (category I only). Of these, the drop test, stackability, and vibration tests are probably the most severe. For cases under gross (loaded) the drop test requires 160 face drops from , 80 edge drops from , and 40 corner drops from 36 inches. The face drop distance is reduced to up to , , or more. Category II cases are dropped one-tenth as many times from and at 50 pounds, and proportionally for heavier cases. The stackability test requires every case face over to support centered on of the face for 24 hours. The vibration test searches for the four strongest resonances between 5 and 50 Hz, and then tests each at for 2 hours on each principal axis. The penetration test is a 6-kilogram steel bar 3.2 centimeters in diameter with a hemispherical end dropped 0.5 meters on the weakest point. For all tests no degradation or functional damage is allowed. Caster wheels are often built into or attached to the case for ease of transit, and may be removable to prevent damage to other containers or to the airframe. Molded cases are typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene plastic by injection molding or rotational molding and may be gasketed for splash protection. They typically have similar interior and wheel options as fabricated panel cases. The ATA specified performance temperature range tends to exclude thermoplastic cases large enough to be subject to the stackability test. Cases may be further customized by adding a power adapter and a computer fan. Thus certain equipment may operate in transit or at destination without leaving the protection of the case.  Uses  Typical uses for road cases on tour are wardrobe, hair and make-up, catering, rigging, backline, sound reinforcement equipment, stage lighting, video, production and carpentry. Road cases got their name because they are usually used by touring entertainment companies that need to take their show out 'on the road'. Road cases configured with rackmounts are widely used on the road for pro audio, lighting, sound recording and video. Other applications include motion picture production, military, sports, medical, rental and staging. In January 2020, the former head of Renault‚ÄìNissan‚ÄìMitsubishi Alliance, Carlos Ghosn apparently escaped from Japan hidden in a road case.

It was originally known as the RISC System/6000 CPU or, when in an abbreviated form, the RS/6000 CPU, before introduction of successors required the original name to be replaced with one that used the same naming scheme (POWERn) as its successors in order to differentiate it from the newer designs.  History  The POWER1 was introduced in 1990, with the introduction of the IBM RS/6000 POWERserver servers and POWERstation workstations, which featured the POWER1 clocked at 20, 25 or 30 MHz. The POWER1 received two upgrades, one in 1991, with the introduction of the POWER1+ and in 1992, with the introduction of POWER1++. These upgraded versions were clocked higher than the original POWER1, made possible by improved semiconductor processes. The POWER1+ was clocked slightly higher than the original POWER1, at frequencies of 25, 33 and 41 MHz, while the POWER1++ took the microarchitecture to its highest frequencies ‚Äî 25, 33, 41.6, 45, 50 and 62.5 MHz. In September 1993, the POWER1 and its variants was succeeded by the POWER2 (known briefly as the \\"RIOS2\\"), an evolution of the POWER1 microarchitecture. The direct derivatives of the POWER1 are the RISC Single Chip (RSC), feature-reduced single-chip variant for entry-level RS/6000 systems, and the RAD6000, a radiation-hardened variant of the RSC for space applications. An indirect derivative of the POWER1 is the PowerPC 601, a feature-reduced variant of the RSC intended for consumer applications. The POWER1 is notable as it represented a number of firsts for IBM and computing in general. It was IBM's first RISC processor intended for high-end applications (the ROMP was considered a commercial failure and was not used in high-end workstations), it was the first to implement the then new POWER instruction set architecture and it was IBM's first successful RISC processor. For computing firsts, the POWER1 would be known for being the first CPU to implement some form of register renaming and out-of-order execution, a technique that improves the performance of superscalar processors but was previously reserved for mainframes. The POWER1 was also the origin for the highly successful families of POWER, PowerPC and Power ISA processors that followed it, measuring in hundreds of different implementations. The open source GCC compiler removed support for POWER1 (RIOS) and POWER2 (RIOS2) in the 4.5 release.  Microarchitecture  The POWER1 is a 32-bit two-way superscalar CPU. It contains three major execution units, a fixed-point unit (FXU), a branch unit (BPU) and a floating point unit (FPU). Although the POWER1 is a 32-bit CPU with a 32-bit physical address, its virtual address is 52 bits long. The larger virtual address space was chosen because it was beneficial for the performance of applications, allowing each one to have a large 4 GB address range. The POWER1 is a big-endian CPU that uses a Harvard style cache hierarchy with separate instruction and data caches. The instruction cache, referred to as the \\"I-cache\\" by IBM, is 8 KB in size and is two-way set associative with a line size of 64 bytes. The I-cache is located on the ICU chip. The data cache, referred to as the \\"D-cache\\" by IBM, is 32 KB in size for RIOS.9 configurations and 64 KB in size for RIOS-1 configurations. The D-cache is four-way set associative with a line size of 128 bytes. The D-cache employs a store-back scheme, where data that is to be stored is written to the cache instead of the memory in order to reduce the number of writes destined for the memory. The store-back scheme is used to prevent the CPU from monopolizing access to the memory. Although the POWER1 was a high-end design, it was not capable of multiprocessing, and as such was disadvantaged, as the only way performance could be improved was by clocking the CPU higher, which was difficult to do with such a large multi-chip design. IBM used clustering to overcome this disadvantage in POWER1 systems, allowing them to effectively function as if they were multiprocessing systems, a concept proven by the popularity of SP1 supercomputers based on the POWER1. As the POWER1 was the basis of the POWER2 and P2SC microprocessors, the lack of multiprocessing was passed on to these later POWER processors. Multiprocessing was not supported until the introduction of the POWER3 in 1998.  Physical description  A POWER CPU from an entry-level desktop RS/6000 32H workstation The chip complex of the RIOS-1 processor (Each line represents a 32-bit bus.) The chip complex of the RIOS.9 processor (Each line represents a 32-bit bus.) The POWER1 is a multi-chip CPU built from separate chips that are connected to each other by buses. The POWER1 consists of an instruction-cache unit (ICU), a fixed-point unit (FXU), a floating point unit (FPU), a number of data-cache units (DCU), a storage-control unit (SCU) and an I/O unit. Due to its modular design, IBM was able to create two configurations by simply varying the number of DCUs, RIOS-1 and a RIOS.9. The RIOS-1 configuration has four DCUs, the intended amount, and was clocked at up to 40 MHz, whereas the RIOS.9 CPU had two DCUs and was clocked at lower frequencies. The chips are mounted on the ‚ÄúCPU planar‚Äù, a printed circuit board (PCB), using through-hole technology. Due to the large number of chips with wide buses, the PCB has eight planes for routing wires, four for power and ground and four for signals. There are two signal planes on each side of the board, while the four power and ground planes are in the center. The chips that make up the POWER1 are fabricated in a 1.0 ¬µm CMOS process with three layers of interconnect. The chips are packaged in ceramic pin grid array (CPGA) packages that can have up to 300 pins and dissipate a maximum of 4 W of heat each. The total number of transistors featured by the POWER1, assuming that it is a RIOS-1 configuration, is 6.9 million, with 2.04 million used for logic and 4.86 million used for memory. The die area of all the chips combined is 1,284 mm¬≤. The total number of signal pins is 1,464. = Chips =  Instruction-cache unit (ICU)  The ICU contains the instruction cache, referred to as the \\"I-cache\\" by IBM and the branch processing unit (BPU). The BPU contains the program counter, the condition code register and a loop register. The ICU contains 0.75 million transistors with 0.2 million used for logic and 0.55 million used for SRAM. The ICU die measures approximately 160 mm¬≤ (12.7 √ó 12.7 mm). The BPU was capable of dispatching multiple instructions to the fixed and floating point instructions queues while it was executing a program flow control instruction (up to four simultaneously and out of order). Speculative branches were also supported by using a prediction bit in the branch instructions, with the results discarded before being saved if the branch was not taken. The alternate instruction would be buffered and discarded if the branch was taken. Consequently, subroutine calls and interrupts are dealt with without incurring branch penalties. The condition code register has eight field sets, with the first two reserved for fixed and floating point instructions and the seventh for vector instructions. The rest of the fields could be used by other instructions. The loop register is a counter for \\"decrement and branch on zero\\" loops with no branch penalty, a feature similar to those found in some DSPs such as the TMS320C30.  Fixed-point unit (FXU)  The FXU is responsible for decoding and executing all fixed-point instructions and floating-point load and store instructions. For execution, the FXU contains the POWER1's fixed-point register file, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for general instructions, and a dedicated fixed-point multiply and divide unit. It also contains instruction buffers that receive both fixed- and floating-point instructions from the ICU, passing on the floating-point instructions to the FPU, and a 128-entry two-way set-associative D-TLB for address translation. The FXU contains approximately 0.5 million transistors, with 0.25 million used for logic and 0.25 used for memory, on a die measuring approximately 160 mm¬≤.  Floating-point unit (FPU)  The POWER1's floating point unit executes floating-point instructions issue by the ICU. The FPU is pipelined and can execute single precision (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit) instructions. It is capable of performing multiply-add instructions, which contributed to the POWER1's high floating point performance. In most processors, a multiply and an add, which is common in technical and scientific floating-point code, cannot be executed in one cycle, as in the POWER1. Use of fused multiply‚Äìadd also means that the data is only rounded once, improving the precision of the result slightly. The floating- point register file is also located on the FPU chip. It contains 32 64-bit floating-point registers, six rename registers and two registers that are used by divide instructions.  Data-cache unit (DCU)  The POWER1 has a 64 KB data cache implemented through four identical data-cache units (DCU), each containing 16 KB of data cache. The cache and the buses that connect the DCU to the other chips are ECC protected. The DCUs also provide the interface to the memory. If two DCUs are present (RIOS.9 configuration), the memory bus is 64 bits wide, and if four DCUs are present (RIOS-1 configuration), the memory bus is 128 bits wide. The memory interface portion of the DCUs provide three features that improves the reliability and availability of the memory: memory scrubbing, ECC and bit steering. Each DCU contains approximately 1.125 million transistors, with 0.175 million used for logic and 0.95 million used for SRAM, on a die measuring approximately 130 mm¬≤ (11.3 √ó 11.3 mm).  Storage- control unit (SCU)  The POWER1 is controlled by the SCU chip. All communications between the ICU, FXU and DCU chips as well as the memory and I/O devices is arbitrated by the SCU. Although the DCUs provide the means to perform memory scrubbing, it is the SCU that controls the process. The SCU contains approximately 0.23 million transistors, all of them for logic, on a die measuring approximately 130 mm¬≤.  I/O unit  The POWER1's I/O interfaces are implemented by the I/O unit, which contains an I/O channel controller (IOCC) and two serial link adapters (SLAs). The IOCC implements the Micro Channel interface and controls both I/O and DMA transactions between the Micro Channel adapters and the system memory. The two SLAs each implement a serial fibre optic link, which are intended to connect RS/6000 systems together. The optical links were not supported at the time of the RS/6000's release.

He is a former member of Down (2001‚Äì2011) and the former bassist for the band Kill Devil Hill. He released his debut solo album Smoke on This on July 28, 2017. For the first time in Brown's career, the work features him not only as a bassist but also as lead vocalist and guitarist. Brown authored a book called Official Truth 101 Proof, which was released in April 2013. The book documents Pantera's formation, career, and disbandment. Biography Rex Robert Brown was born in Graham, Texas on July 27, 1964.Texas Births, 1926‚Äì1995, Rex Robert Brown His father was forty when Brown was born, and died in 1971. He was raised by his mother and sister. Brown was first introduced to music through his grandmother, who taught him to play the piano when he was a child, and turned him onto ragtime music and Scott Joplin. Brown was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. Brown became a fan of ZZ Top and Def Leppard as a youth, and started playing bass when he was twelve years old. He remains a fan of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and hardcore punk. Career =Pantera= Pantera was formed in 1981. Brown joined Pantera on bass in 1982 replacing Tommy D. Bradford and adopting the alias \\"Rex Rocker\\". Brown was a classmate of, and played in the high school jazz band with, drummer Vinnie Paul, and guitarist Dimebag Darrell (then known as Diamond Darrell). Brown was credited as \\"Rex Rocker\\" on Pantera's first three albums: Metal Magic (1983), Projects in the Jungle (1984), and I Am the Night (1985), he would be credited by his birth name starting with the band's fourth album Power Metal and onwards. Pantera recruited vocalist Phil Anselmo to replace Terry Glaze in 1987. With Anselmo taking over as the new frontman, the band's fourth album, Power Metal, was released in 1988. By 1990, the band had been signed with Atco Records, and released their fifth album, Cowboys from Hell, which proved to be the band's turning point to commercial success. Over the course of the band's walkthrough in the 1990s decade, Pantera released four more studio albums, Vulgar Display of Power (1992), Far Beyond Driven (1994), The Great Southern Trendkill (1996), and Reinventing the Steel (2000). After releases of a 1997 live album and a greatest hits compilation, Pantera was nominated for four best metal performance Grammys, for \\"I'm Broken,\\" \\"Suicide Note Pt. I,\\" \\"Cemetery Gates\\", and \\"Revolution Is My Name.\\" In 2001, Pantera went on what at the time was believed to be a temporary hiatus, mainly due to Anselmo's focus on side projects. Pantera would officially disband in 2003. =Down= Brown performing with Down at Gods of Metal 2009 In 1998, during his stay in Louisiana, he was invited by Phil Anselmo for a jam session that included all the members of Down except their bass player Todd Strange, who left the band. That night they ended up writing several demos for what later became their second album recorded in the fall of 2001 at Anselmo's barn that had been transformed into a professional studio. The album was released on March 26, 2002, and became the first Down release featuring Brown on bass. The band, however, went on hiatus again at the very end of 2002. In 2006, the band reunited and started writing the material for their third studio album. Down III: Over the Under was released in 2007. The band toured as the opening act for Metallica. During that time, he became good friends with James Hetfield, who - similarly to Brown - completed an alcohol rehabilitation course back in 2002. Wanting to explore different music, Brown left Down in 2011. =Other work= Brown performing in Nashville, Tennessee, 2017 In 1999, Brown, Dimebag Darrell, and Vinnie Paul teamed up with country artist David Allan Coe in a project called Rebel Meets Rebel. This group released an album on May 2, 2006 on Vinnie Paul's Big Vin Records label. Brown has worked previously with Jerry Cantrell on five tracks included on the album called Boggy Depot as well as eleven tracks with Crowbar on the album Lifesblood for the Downtrodden. He has also provided bass work for Crowbar in 2004 and 2005 and to Cavalera Conspiracy in 2008. Rex revealed his new project Arms of the Sun, a project also featuring John Luke Hebert (of King Diamond) on drums, Lance Harvill on vocals and guitar, and Ben Bunker (of Gryn) on guitar. The group has completed work on thirteen tracks at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Recording Studio in Austin, produced and mixed by Terry Date. In February 2011 it was announced that Brown had amicably left Arms of the Sun. A replacement bassist has not yet been announced. In March 2011, it was announced that Brown had formed a new band, Kill Devil Hill with Vinny Appice (Heaven & Hell, Black Sabbath, Dio) on drums, Mark Zavon (RATT, W.A.S.P., 40 Cycle Hum) on guitar and Dewey Bragg (Pissing Razors) on vocals. The group has demoed around 10 songs, which, according to Appice, sound \\"like a cross between Black Sabbath, Alice in Chains and a little bit of Led Zeppelin thrown in. It's heavy, but with a lot of cool hooks and melodic overtones, too.\\" Kill Devil Hill released their debut album in May 2012 to critical acclaim, and continue to tour in support of their music. In 2013, Brown released an autobiography, titled Official Truth: 101 Proof, which chronicles his personal life and journey through Pantera, including the events leading to the band's disbandment. In 2015, Brown penned the foreword to the book Survival of the Fittest: Heavy Metal in the 1990s, by author Greg Prato. Rex was also interviewed for the book (as well as his former bandmate in Pantera, Anselmo, among many others). Personal life According to his autobiography, Brown met his future ex-wife Belinda through a mutual friend. The couple got engaged in 1994 and married in May 1995. They have twins born in 2000. Brown refuses to give any further information on his children in order to keep their privacy. The couple divorced in 2004 but reunited in 2007, and remained together until 2011. Brown does not \\"subscribe to any particular organized religion\\", though he says he believes in God and the Ten Commandments.Official Truth, 101 Proof; p. 7Official Truth, 101 Proof; p. 252, In his acknowledgements, he says that two women have affected him deeply: his ex-wife Belinda and his first love Elena who he is now reunited with.Official Truth, 101 Proof; p. 8 In August 2009, Brown was disincluded from the Down tour due to acute pancreatitis. He then had his gallbladder and polyps on his pancreas removed. \\"Rex has been through hell, man,\\" said bandmate Pepper Keenan. \\"He was cut from rib to rib and they cleaned him out, but he's in top shape again. After twenty-five years on the road ‚Äì drinking every day and whatnot‚Ä¶ well, the old days are over, my friend.\\"Ling, Dave, \\"Live! Down\\"; Classic Rock #148, August 2010, p106 Playing style and equipment Brown in 2017 Brown was a jazz bassist and was offered a scholarship by the University of North Texas, but declined. He often plays with a pick. Brown was notable for often contributing walking basslines underneath Dimebag Darrell's guitar solos. Standout tracks include \\"Floods\\", \\"Walk\\", \\"5 Minutes Alone\\", \\"Throes of Rejection\\", \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", \\"Living Through Me (Hells' Wrath)\\", \\"I Can't Hide\\", \\"Use My Third Arm\\", \\"Where You Come From\\", \\"This Love\\", \\"I'm Broken\\", among others. In Pantera's earliest days, Brown was witnessed playing an Ibanez Roadstar bass. In the late 1980s, he switched to Charvel basses and played a white 5 string and a black 4 string model. He used these basses exclusively through the Cowboys from Hell and Vulgar Display of Power albums, before he briefly used a 4 and 5 string model Ernie Ball Music Man StingRay bass during the Vulgar Display of Power tour as well as a Fernandes Telecaster shaped bass for the \\"Walk\\" music video. In 1993, Brown began endorsing Spector bass guitars, notably all his basses had humbuckers. He continues to use Spectors to this day, with his own signature model. Shaped somewhat similar to a Gibson Thunderbird, the Spector Rex Brown Signature bass comes in several different finishes and is available in 4 and 5 string models. In 2011, Spector released a new signature bass by Brown named the Spector RXT. The bass has the same electronics as his first signature bass but instead of a Thunderbird, it is shaped like a Telecaster. Although this was released to the market by Spector, it was originally intended to be released by ESP Guitars under the LTD banner. Several prototypes and pre-production models exist, some of which are owned by Brown and can be seen used while playing with Down in 2009. After over 20 years of using Spector basses, on July 6, 2015, Brown announced that he had left Spector and is now a Warwick artist, by showing a photo of his new Warwick bass. =Basses= * 1989 Jackson USA Custom ‚Äì 4 string white * Spector Rex-5XL ‚Äì Rex signature bass * Custom Spector NS4-style bass * Spector NS basses ‚Äì 4 and 5 stringed model * Fender Precision Bass ‚Äì Used in studio. * Fernandes \\"Telecaster\\" prototype basses ‚Äì 4 and 5 stringed models * Fernandes 8-string ‚Äì Used in studio. * Musicman Stingray basses ‚Äì 4 and 5 stringed model * ESP Surveyor basses (4&5 strings) * Charvel basses ‚Äì 850XL 4 string and Fusion 5 string * Ibanez Roadstar bass ‚Äì 4 string * ESP/LTD REX-600 prototypes - ESP/LTD signature that never made it into production * Ovation B778-5 ‚Äì acoustic bass * Warwick Rex Brown Reverso- Signature 4 string and 5 string. * Ernie Ball Cobalt Hybrid Slinky bass strings. =Effects= * BOSS CH-1 Super Chorus * Morley Pro Series 2 Bass Wah * Korg DTR-1 Rack Tuner * Korg DT-10 Tuner * Korg Pitchblack Tuner * Rocktron Basix Bass Preamp * Ashdown Bass Chorus Plus * MXR Phase 90 * HBE Hematoma * MXR Blowtorch Bass Distortion * MXR Carbon Copy Delay * BOSS CEB-3 Bass Chorus =Amplifiers= * Ampeg SVT- IVPRO Head * Vintage Ampeg SVT Head * Ampeg SVT-IIPro Head * Ampeg SVT-II Head * Hartke Kilo 1000 Watt Bass Head * Ampeg SVT810AV Bass Cabinet / 8x10 * Ampeg SVT410HE Bass Cabinet / 4x10 * Ampeg SVT810E Bass Cabinet / 8x10 * Hartke HyDrive 8x10 Bass Cabinet / 8x10 Discography =Album appearances= ;Solo *2017 Smoke On This‚Ä¶ ;Pantera *1983 Metal Magic *1984 Projects in the Jungle *1985 I Am the Night *1988 Power Metal *1990 Cowboys from Hell *1992 Vulgar Display of Power *1994 Far Beyond Driven *1996 The Great Southern Trendkill *2000 Reinventing the Steel ;Down *2002 ‚Äì Down ‚Äì Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow *2007 ‚Äì Down ‚Äì Down III: Over the Under *2010 ‚Äì Down ‚Äì Diary of a Mad Band: Europe in the Year of VI CD/DVD ;Jerry Cantrell *1998 Boggy Depot ;Crowbar *2005 Lifesblood for the Downtrodden ;David Allan Coe and Cowboys from Hell *2006 Rebel Meets Rebel ;Kill Devil Hill *2012 Kill Devil Hill *2013 Revolution Rise =Collaborations= *1998 ‚Äì Jerry Cantrell ‚Äì Boggy Depot (\\"Dickeye,\\" \\"My Song,\\" \\"Keep the Light On,\\" \\"Satisfy,\\" and \\"Hurt a Long Time\\") *2008 ‚Äì Cavalera Conspiracy ‚Äì Inflikted (\\"Ultra-Violent\\") References External links * Pantera's Rex Brown ‚Äì Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? on Loudwire.com 1964 births American heavy metal bass guitarists American male bass guitarists Pantera members Living people People from Graham, Texas Musicians from New Orleans Musicians from Dallas Writers from New Orleans Eagle Scouts (Boy Scouts of America) Guitarists from Louisiana Guitarists from Texas 20th-century American guitarists Down (band) members Crowbar (American band) members Kill Devil Hill (band) members ","title":"Rex Brown"},{"id":"1199748","text":":See also the 166 Inter GT car :See also the 166 MM Berlinetta Le Mans :See also the Ferrari-Abarth 166 MM/53 The Ferrari 166 S was a sports racing car built by Ferrari between 1948 and 1953, an evolution of its Colombo V12-powered 125 S racer. It was adapted into a sports car for the street in the form of the 166 Inter. Only 12 Ferrari 166 S were produced, nine of them with cycle-fenders as the Spyder Corsa. It was soon followed by the updated and highly successful Ferrari 166 MM (Mille Miglia), of which 47 were made from 1948 to 1953. Its early victories in the Targa Florio and Mille Miglia and others in international competition made the manufacturer a serious competitor in the racing industry. Both were later replaced by the 2.3 L 195 S. Design The 166 shared its Aurelio Lampredi-designed tube frame and double wishbone/live axle suspension with the 125. Like the 125, the wheelbase was 2420 mm long. Nine 166 Spyder Corsas and three 166 Sports were built. The first two 166 S models were coachbuilt by Carrozzeria Allemano and the last one by Carlo Anderloni at Carrozzeria Touring. Majority of the 166 MM cars were bodied at Touring in a barchetta form. The 1.5 L Gioacchino Colombo- designed V12 engine of the 125 was changed, however, with single overhead camshafts specified and a larger 2.0 L (1995 cc/121 in¬≥) displacement. This was achieved with both a bore and stroke increase, to 60 by 58.8 mm respectively. Output was at 5,600 rpm to at 6,500 rpm with three carburetors, giving top speed of . For the 166 MM power output rose to at 6,600 rpm and top speed to . Motor Trend Classic named the 166 MM Barchetta as number six in their list of the ten \\"Greatest Ferraris of all time\\". Racing The Ferrari 166 S won Targa Florio with Clemente Biondetti and Igor Troubetzkoy in 1948. In 1949, Biondetti also won in the 166 SC with Benedetti as co-driver. The 166 S won 1948 Mille Miglia, also driven by Biondetti, this time with Giuseppe Navone. In 1949 Mille Miglia, the Ferrari 166 MM Barchettas scored 1-2 victory with Biondetti/Salani and Bonetto/Carpani respectively. In 1949, the 166 MM also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the hands of Luigi Chinetti and Lord Selsdon, and so the 166 was the only car ever to win all three races. The another 166 won the 1949 Spa 24 Hours. A 166 chassis, this time with the bigger 195 S engine, won the Mille Miglia again in 1950 with drivers Giannino Marzotto and Marco Crosara. Surviving examples The oldest Ferrari car with an undisputed pedigree is s/n 002C, a 166 Spider Corsa which was originally a 159 and is currently owned and driven by James Glickenhaus. S/n 0052M, a 1950 166 MM Touring Barchetta was uncovered in a barn and was shown in public for the first time since 1959 in the August 2006 issue of Cavallino magazine. One 166 MM, 1949 s/n 0018M, was bodied by Zagato in 'Panoramica' style, very similar to their one-off Maserati A6 1500, also designed by Luigi Rapi. It is considered as first Ferrari coachbuilt by Zagato. A year later it was rebodied as Zagato Spyder. Currently Zagato offers Sanction Lost programme to bring lost designs back to life. The aforementioned car was recreated in 2007.

Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and Rwanda- affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war to their own advantage by looting, cattle rustling or banditry. Groups that fall under the umbrella term \\"Mai-Mai\\" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads and politically motivated resistance fighters. Because Mai Mai have only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai refers not to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups. The name comes from the Swahili word for water, \\"maji\\". Militia members sprinkle themselves with water to protect themselves from bullets. E.F. Kisangani, S.F. Bobb, Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Mai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, North Kivu and South Kivu (the \\"Kivus\\"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied Banyamulenge- dominated rebel faction, the Rally for Congolese Democracy‚ÄìGoma (RCD-Goma) during the Second Congo War. While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority Batembo and Babembe ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai- Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 Lusaka Accord, which was meant to end the Second Congo War, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict, and the lack of co-operation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process. Mai-Mai in North and South Kivu The East-central DRC, showing Kivu According to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai were active in the two Kivu provinces. The two most powerful and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in the Kivus were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia. Currently most active is a group which is called Mai-Mai Yakutumba, was organized in 2007 by General Yakutumba. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai. A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the Mudundu 40/Front de R√©sistance et de D√©fense du Kivu (FRDKI) and Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Za√Øre/Forces Unies de R√©sistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la R√©publ√≠que D√©mocratique du Congo (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the Rwandan military and Rally for Congolese Democracy‚ÄìGoma (RCD-Goma). Walikale and Masisi north of Goma were the centres of Mai-Mai activity in North Kivu. In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around Walungu and Bunyakiri south of Lake Kivu, around Uvira and Mwenaga at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, further south around Fizi, and around Shabunda, between the Rwandan border and Kindu. A Mai-Mai leader, Colonel Mayele, was arrested by UN forces in October 2010, allegedly being the leader behind mass rapes in the Walikale region of North Kivu province.Congo rebel chief arrested over mass rape ‚Äì The Irish Times ‚Äì Thu, Oct 07, 2010 Mai-Mai in Katanga A former leader of the Mai- Mai, G√©d√©on Kyungu Mutanga, turned himself over to MONUC troops in May 2006. He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in Katanga Province on 6 March 2009. He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the Mai-Mai Kata Katanga (\\"Secede Katanga\\"). Other Mai-Mai groups There was a large Mai-Mai presence in Maniema, in particular around Kindu and Kalemie. Province Orientale also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes. Mai-Mai Gedeon is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga. The Corak Kata Katanga also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga, composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s. They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011. It is unclear to what extent all these groups are co-ordinated. The Nduma Defense of Congo (or Mai-Mai Sheka) was formed in 2009 by former minerals trader Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, an ethnic Nyanga. Sheka claims the group was formed to liberate the mines of Walikale Territory in North Kivu. The NDC are accused of a mass rape of at least 387 women, men, and children over a three-day span in Walikale in 2010. Mai-Mai and the mountain gorillas In May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two wildlife officers in Virunga National Park and threatened to kill mountain gorillas if the government retaliated. The Mai-Mai are also suspected of the killings of nine mountain gorillas, with the use of machetes, and automatic weapons. In an October 2012 incident, Mai-Mai killed two park staff and a soldier, while three soldiers were injured. From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the World Wildlife Foundation.WWF deeply saddened by death of Virunga park protectors (WWF article) Six Virunga Park Rangers were reported to have been killed in Virunga National Park. Five rangers and a driver were killed in an ambush and a sixth ranger was injured in the Central section of the vast reserve on April 9, 2018.

They are evergreen terrestrial herbs with crowded pseudobulbs, a small number of leaves and medium-sized resupinate flowers on an upright flowering stem. The sepals and petals are all similar to each other and are white, yellow, pink or purple. Species of Spathoglottis are found from eastern and south-eastern Asia to Australia and some Pacific Islands.  Description  Orchids in the genus Spathoglottis are evergreen, terrestrial herbs with crowded pseudobulbs just below the surface of the soil and a few large, pleated leaves. The flowering stem emerges from a pseudoblulb and bears medium-sized, colourful flowers. The flowers open widely with the sepals and petals all similar in size to each other, although with the petals usually broader, the sepals are hairy on the outside. The labellum has three lobes, the side lobes more or less upright and the middle lobe with a claw near its base. Taxonomy and naming The genus Spathoglottis was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume who published the description in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´.

The design of the trains was based on the Siemens Modular Metro. History In March 2000 M>Train ordered 62 Siemens Nexas trains to fulfill a franchise commitment to replace its fleet of Hitachi trains.Siemens Transportation Systems wins major contract in Australia Siemens 1 April 2000Bayside trains franchise agreement part 8 Government of VictoriaAnnual Report December 2000 National Express Group The original order was for 62 3-car sets, with an option for an additional ten 3-car sets. In December 2002 just before the first was delivered, National Express handed the M>Train franchise back to the Government of Victoria, thus the first Siemens Nexas' were delivered to the government. All passed to Connex Melbourne in April 2004. The option for ten additional trains was exercised in August 2005, with the last of these delivered in January 2006. Siemens Rail Services was contracted to provide maintenance of the trains for a period of 15 years (subject to refranchising) at Newport Workshops. With the refranchising of the network to Metro Trains Melbourne in 2009, this maintenance arrangement was retained for an initial three-year period. The first entered service on 21 March 2003 with the last delivered in January 2006.Siemens Vicsig In December 2014, Siemens Nexas 831M-2566T -832M with a reduced seating layout added extra hand rails layout at the doors. Braking issues In late 2006 the trains suffered a number of braking discrepancies while in service; 14 trains overshot platforms in the space of three days. The 15 units involved in these overshoots were withdrawn from service for checks, and instructions were issued to the drivers to minimise further occurrences. By mid-January 2007, a total of 24 three-carriage trains had been impounded for testing after 20 further incidents of over-running stations since 22 December 2006. On 13 January 2007, Connex stopped running the Siemens Nexas trains as 3-car sets until the braking issue was resolved, with the result that all services (including evenings and weekends) were operated by 6-car trains. On 29 January 2007, Connex cancelled 37 peak-period services until further notice, due to the shortage of operational trains. By 1 February 2007, 38 three-car sets were withdrawn due to continuing braking failures, meaning that more than half of the Siemens Nexas fleet (or around 10% of the total fleet) was out of revenue service. Amidst the media reporting an escalating problem with the risk of the entire fleet potentially having to be suspended, Siemens issued a statement on 31 January 2008 saying that they believed there had been no evidence during investigations of the braking failures that would require the entire fleet of trains to be withdrawn from service. Testing of affected trains was carried out on the Werribee line between Newport and Laverton, with soapy water sprayed onto the rails to increase the amount of wheel slip experienced, in an effort to replicate the brake fault. The entire fleet has now re-entered service, although with a restriction not to run single unit (3 car) operations. In December 2008 train operator Connex commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court to claim damages from Siemens. Connex claims Siemens provided trains with a braking system that was \\"defective, faulty and inadequate\\", the trains being \\"not fit for their purpose\\" and were not of \\"merchantable quality\\". In March 2009, it was reported that three Siemens Nexas trains had been impounded due to new braking incidents in the week prior. By December 2010 sanding equipment was trialled on set 773M-2537T-774M in order to improve braking performance of the trains, and by February 2011 a number of in-service trains had also been fitted with the equipment. The sand boxes are fitted to the middle two bogies of each 3-car set. In June 2011 installation of sanding equipment was completed across the entire fleet. Speed restrictions have now been lifted on all Siemens Nexas trains. In September 2011 the Office of the Chief Investigator for transport safety found that \\"the relatively high frequency of overruns involving Nexas trains was neither the result of individual train defects nor any deficiency in train maintenance\\". Design & Construction The bodies of the Siemens Modular Metro trains evolved from the 1993 DT2 Series used in the Nuremberg U-Bahn whose design in turn came from production of the A Series built for the nearby Munich U-Bahn, but now also used in Nuremberg. The version of Siemens metro train designed for Melbourne included several attributes similar to existing Melbourne suburban electric trains such as being single-deck and operating in M-T-M (motor-trailer-motor) sets of three carriages, where the motor cars each have an overhead pantograph, and two of these 3-car sets are generally coupled together to form a 6-carriage train when run in revenue service, though a single set may be run when demand does not merit a full train. All were built by Siemens Transportation Systems, Vienna with the final fitout completed at Newport Workshops. There are several notable differences between the Siemens Nexas trains and other trains which operate in Melbourne. These include: *2+2 seating. All other trains had 2+3 seating, however X'Trapolis 100 trains ordered as part of the 2008 Victorian Government Transport Plans have the same 2+2 seating configuration, and existing X'Trapolis trains had their seats modified to a 2+2 configuration as part of the franchise agreement.Train Franchise Agreement Volume 2 Public Transport Victoria *Two doors per carriage per side. Being significantly wider they were theorised to be slightly more efficient in loading and unloading passengers, although this is disputed by some sources, who believe the fewer doors lead to longer platform dwell times compared to the three smaller doors in other Melbourne trains. *Plug-type doors - hinged outward and slide along the outside of the vehicle when opening. *Extreme smooth, vertical walls. *Open articulation. Passengers can freely move from carriage to carriage, within a 3-carriage set, without opening doors, the first such train with this configuration in Melbourne. The Siemens Nexas' are fitted with Passenger information system produced by the German firm Annax. The system does not announce service details at the commencement of a journey, express running or the end of services. In June 2008 Connex started a program to replace the seat coverings in a number of Siemens trains, using the same type of fabric as used in the X'Trapolis 100 trains, Metro Trains Melbourne has since put in new seating fabric displaying various stations around the network, to almost half the fleet. Refurbishment In 2016 Metro Trains Melbourne began refurbishing the interior carriages of Siemens trains. All windguards and glass screens were removed from the doorways and replaced with a smaller vertical handrail (except where wheelchair access is required), a number of seats removed near the doors and extra vertical and horizontal handrails fitted to improve comfort and capacity. A cleaning program occurred at the same time, which included fitting new seat pads and covers, re-painting walls and applying anti-graffiti film to the windows. As of August 2017, the entire fleet had been refurbished. A similar refurbishment has been completed on the older Comeng trains. In 2019 Trains Melbourne began to replace the Gangway systems. The new H√ºbner System has at the floor an articulated bridge system instead of the plate system. Also the sound insulation and the behavior of the bellows system has been improved. Liveries The Siemens trains have a stainless steel body, and were seen in a number of different liveries in their early years, owing to the changes in ownership that have occurred while the trains were entering service. The trains were originally delivered with M>Train blue and green stripes on the side, and the M>Train 'swirl' on the front fairing. Later deliveries entering service in bare metal on the sides, and white front fairings with a green and yellow striped bar. On entering Connex Melbourne ownership, blue and yellow stripes were progressively added to the side of all trains, and front fairings were repainted yellow with the blue Connex logo. After Metro Trains Melbourne took over the operation of the suburban network in November 2009, the Connex logo on all trains was covered over as a temporary measure, with all sets progressively being repainted into Metro livery, a process completed in March 2010.

Since the election of 1967 (1968 Session), the Assembly has consisted of 80 members. Two members are elected from each of New Jersey's 40 legislative districts for a term of two years, each representing districts with average populations of 210,359 (2000 figures). To be eligible to run, a potential candidate must be at least 21 years of age, and must have lived in their district for at least one year prior to the election, and have lived in the state of New Jersey for two years. They also must be residents of their districts. Membership in the Assembly is considered a part-time job, and many members have employment in addition to their legislative work. Assembly members serve two-year terms, elected every odd-numbered year in November. Several members of the Assembly hold other elective office, as they are grandfathered in under a New Jersey law that banned multiple office holding in 2007. The Assembly is led by the Speaker of the Assembly, who is elected by the membership of the chamber. After the Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey and the President of the New Jersey Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly is third in the line of succession to replace the Governor of New Jersey in the event that he or she is unable to execute the duties of that office. The Speaker decides the schedule for the Assembly, which bills will be considered, appoints committee chairmen, and generally runs the Assembly's agenda. The current Speaker is Craig Coughlin (D-Woodbridge). Salary and costs Members of the NJ General Assembly receive an annual base salary of $49,000 with the Senate President and the Assembly Speaker earning slightly more.NJ.com, Published June 2011 Members receive $110,000 for staff salaries. In addition, they receive 12,500 postage stamps, stationery and a telephone card. They receive New Jersey State health insurance and other benefits. The total cost to the State of New Jersey for each member of the general assembly is approximately $200,000 annually.

Not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment. The test is performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed. The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular goal, then reviews available information and undertakes various means to attain that goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (which provides background and system information) or black box (which provides only basic or no information except the company name). A gray box penetration test is a combination of the two (where limited knowledge of the target is shared with the auditor). A penetration test can help determine whether a system is vulnerable to attack if the defenses were sufficient, and which defenses (if any) the test defeated. Security issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce risk. The National Cyber Security Center describes penetration testing as the following: \\"A method for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to breach some or all of that system's security, using the same tools and techniques as an adversary might.\\" The goals of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved activity for any given engagement with the primary goal focused on finding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a nefarious actor and informing the client of those vulnerabilities along with recommended mitigation strategies.Patrick Engebretson, The basics of hacking and penetration testing , Elsevier, 2013 Penetration tests are a component of a full security audit. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires penetration testing on a regular schedule, and after system changes. Several standard frameworks and methodologies exist for conducting penetration tests. These include the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES), the NIST Special Publication 800-115, the Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) and the OWASP Testing Guide. Flaw hypothesis methodology is a systems analysis and penetration prediction technique where a list of hypothesized flaws in a software system are compiled through analysis of the specifications and documentation for the system. The list of hypothesized flaws is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system. History By the mid 1960s, growing popularity of time-sharing computer systems that made resources accessible over communications lines created new security concerns. As the scholars Deborah Russell and G. T. Gangemi, Sr. explain, \\"The 1960s marked the true beginning of the age of computer security.\\" In June 1965, for example, several of the country's leading computer security experts held one of the first major conferences on system security‚Äîhosted by the government contractor, the System Development Corporation (SDC). During the conference, someone noted that one SDC employee had been able to easily undermine various system safeguards added to SDC's AN/FSQ-32 time-sharing computer system. In hopes that further system security study would be useful, attendees requested \\"...studies to be conducted in such areas as breaking security protection in the time-shared system.\\" In other words, the conference participants initiated one of the first formal requests to use computer penetration as a tool for studying system security. At the Spring 1967 Joint Computer Conference, many leading computer specialists again met to discuss system security concerns. During this conference, the computer security experts Willis Ware, Harold Petersen, and Rein Tern, all of the RAND Corporation, and Bernard Peters of the National Security Agency (NSA), all used the phrase \\"penetration\\" to describe an attack against a computer system. In a paper, Ware referred to the military's remotely accessible time-sharing systems, warning that \\"Deliberate attempts to penetrate such computer systems must be anticipated.\\" His colleagues Petersen and Turn shared the same concerns, observing that online communication systems \\"...are vulnerable to threats to privacy,\\" including \\"deliberate penetration.\\" Bernard Peters of the NSA made the same point, insisting that computer input and output \\"...could provide large amounts of information to a penetrating program.\\" During the conference, computer penetration would become formally identified as a major threat to online computer systems. The threat that computer penetration posed was next outlined in a major report organized by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) in late 1967. Essentially, DoD officials turned to Willis Ware to lead a task force of experts from NSA, CIA, DoD, academia, and industry to formally assess the security of time-sharing computer systems. By relying on many papers presented during the Spring 1967 Joint Computer Conference, the task force largely confirmed the threat to system security that computer penetration posed. Ware's report was initially classified, but many of the country's leading computer experts quickly identified the study as the definitive document on computer security. Jeffrey R. Yost of the Charles Babbage Institute has more recently described the Ware report as \\"...by far the most important and thorough study on technical and operational issues regarding secure computing systems of its time period.\\" In effect, the Ware report reaffirmed the major threat posed by computer penetration to the new online time-sharing computer systems. To better understand system weaknesses, the federal government and its contractors soon began organizing teams of penetrators, known as tiger teams, to use computer penetration to test system security. Deborah Russell and G. T. Gangemi, Sr. stated that during the 1970s \\"...'tiger teams' first emerged on the computer scene. Tiger teams were government and industry-sponsored teams of crackers who attempted to break down the defenses of computer systems in an effort to uncover, and eventually patch, security holes.\\" A leading scholar on the history of computer security, Donald MacKenzie, similarly points out that, \\"RAND had done some penetration studies (experiments in circumventing computer security controls) of early time-sharing systems on behalf of the government.\\" Jeffrey R. Yost of the Charles Babbage Institute, in his own work on the history of computer security, also acknowledges that both the RAND Corporation and the SDC had \\"engaged in some of the first so-called 'penetration studies' to try to infiltrate time-sharing systems in order to test their vulnerability.\\" In virtually all these early studies, tiger teams successfully broke into all targeted computer systems, as the country's time-sharing systems had poor defenses. Of early tiger team actions, efforts at the RAND Corporation demonstrated the usefulness of penetration as a tool for assessing system security. At the time, one RAND analyst noted that the tests had \\"...demonstrated the practicality of system-penetration as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness and adequacy of implemented data security safeguards.\\" In addition, a number of the RAND analysts insisted that the penetration test exercises all offered several benefits that justified its continued use. As they noted in one paper, \\"A penetrator seems to develop a diabolical frame of mind in his search for operating system weaknesses and incompleteness, which is difficult to emulate.\\" For these reasons and others, many analysts at RAND recommended the continued study of penetration techniques for their usefulness in assessing system security. Perhaps the leading computer penetration expert during these formative years was James P. Anderson, who had worked with the NSA, RAND, and other government agencies to study system security. In early 1971, the U.S. Air Force contracted Anderson's private company to study the security of its time-sharing system at the Pentagon. In his study, Anderson outlined a number of major factors involved in computer penetration. Anderson described a general attack sequence in steps: # Find an exploitable vulnerability. # Design an attack around it. # Test the attack. # Seize a line in use. # Enter the attack. # Exploit the entry for information recovery. Over time, Anderson's description of general computer penetration steps helped guide many other security experts, who relied on this technique to assess time-sharing computer system security. In the following years, computer penetration as a tool for security assessment became more refined and sophisticated. In the early 1980s, the journalist William Broad briefly summarized the ongoing efforts of tiger teams to assess system security. As Broad reported, the DoD-sponsored report by Willis Ware had \\"...showed how spies could actively penetrate computers, steal or copy electronic files and subvert the devices that normally guard top-secret information. The study touched off more than a decade of quiet activity by elite groups of computer scientists working for the Government who tried to break into sensitive computers. They succeeded in every attempt.\\"Broad, William J. (September 25, 1983). \\"Computer Security Worries Military Experts\\", The New York Times While these various studies may have suggested that computer security in the U.S. remained a major problem, the scholar Edward Hunt has more recently made a broader point about the extensive study of computer penetration as a security tool. Hunt suggests in a recent paper on the history of penetration testing that the defense establishment ultimately \\"...created many of the tools used in modern day cyberwarfare,\\" as it carefully defined and researched the many ways that computer penetrators could hack into targeted systems.  Tools  A wide variety of security assessment tools are available to assist with penetration testing, including free-of- charge, free software, and commercial software. = Specialized OS distributions = Several operating system distributions are geared towards penetration testing. Such distributions typically contain a pre-packaged and pre-configured set of tools. The penetration tester does not have to hunt down each individual tool, which might increase the risk complications‚Äîsuch as compile errors, dependency issues, and configuration errors. Also, acquiring additional tools may not be practical in the tester's context. Notable penetration testing OS examples include: * BlackArch based on Arch Linux * BackBox based on Ubuntu * Kali Linux (replaced BackTrack December 2012) based on Debian * Parrot Security OS based on Debian * Pentoo based on Gentoo * WHAX based on Slackware Many other specialized operating systems facilitate penetration testing‚Äîeach more or less dedicated to a specific field of penetration testing. A number of Linux distributions include known OS and application vulnerabilities, and can be deployed as targets to practice against. Such systems help new security professionals try the latest security tools in a lab environment. Examples include Damn Vulnerable Linux (DVL), the OWASP Web Testing Environment (WTW), and Metasploitable. = Software frameworks = * BackBox * Burp Suite * Hping * Metasploit Project * Nessus * Nmap * OWASP ZAP * SAINT * w3af  Penetration testing phases  The process of penetration testing may be simplified into five phases: # Reconnaissance - The act of gathering important information on a target system. This information can be used to better attack the target. For example, open source search engines can be used to find data that can be used in a social engineering attack. # Scanning - Uses technical tools to further the attacker's knowledge of the system. For example, Nmap can be used to scan for open ports. #Gaining Access - Using the data gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phases, the attacker can use a payload to exploit the targeted system. For example, Metasploit can be used to automate attacks on known vulnerabilities. #Maintaining Access - Maintaining access requires taking the steps involved in being able to be persistently within the target environment in order to gather as much data as possible. #Covering Tracks - The attacker must clear any trace of compromising the victim system, any type of data gathered, log events, in order to remain anonymous. Once an attacker has exploited one vulnerability they may gain access to other machines so the process repeats i.e. look for new vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them. This process is referred to as pivoting. =Vulnerabilities= Legal operations that let the tester execute an illegal operation include unescaped SQL commands, unchanged hashed passwords in source-visible projects, human relationships, and old hashing or cryptographic functions. A single flaw may not be enough to enable a critically serious exploit. Leveraging multiple known flaws and shaping the payload in a way that appears as a valid operation is almost always required. Metasploit provides a ruby library for common tasks, and maintains a database of known exploits. Under budget and time constraints, fuzzing is a common technique that discovers vulnerabilities. It aims to get an unhandled error through random input. The tester uses random input to access less often used code paths. Well-trodden code paths are usually free of errors. Errors are useful because they either expose more information, such as HTTP server crashes with full info trace-backs‚Äîor are directly usable, such as buffer overflows. Imagine a website has 100 text input boxes. A few are vulnerable to SQL injections on certain strings. Submitting random strings to those boxes for a while hopefully hits the bugged code path. The error shows itself as a broken HTML page half rendered because of an SQL error. In this case, only text boxes are treated as input streams. However, software systems have many possible input streams, such as cookie and session data, the uploaded file stream, RPC channels, or memory. Errors can happen in any of these input streams. The test goal is to first get an unhandled error and then understand the flaw based on the failed test case. Testers write an automated tool to test their understanding of the flaw until it is correct. After that, it may become obvious how to package the payload so that the target system triggers its execution. If this is not viable, one can hope that another error produced by the fuzzer yields more fruit. The use of a fuzzer saves time by not checking adequate code paths where exploits are unlikely. = Payload = The illegal operation, or payload in Metasploit terminology, can include functions for logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, installing adware, stealing credentials, creating backdoors using shellcode, or altering data. Some companies maintain large databases of known exploits and provide products that automatically test target systems for vulnerabilities: * Metasploit * Nessus * Nmap * OpenVAS * W3af  Standardized government penetration test services  The General Services Administration (GSA) has standardized the \\"penetration test\\" service as a pre-vetted support service, to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities, and stop adversaries before they impact US federal, state and local governments. These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS) and are listed at the US GSA Advantage website. This effort has identified key service providers which have been technically reviewed and vetted to provide these advanced penetration services. This GSA service is intended to improve the rapid ordering and deployment of these services, reduce US government contract duplication, and to protect and support the US infrastructure in a more timely and efficient manner. 132-45A Penetration Testing is security testing in which service assessors mimic real-world attacks to identify methods for circumventing the security features of an application, system, or network. HACS Penetration Testing Services typically strategically test the effectiveness of the organization's preventive and detective security measures employed to protect assets and data. As part of this service, certified ethical hackers typically conduct a simulated attack on a system, systems, applications or another target in the environment, searching for security weaknesses. After testing, they will typically document the vulnerabilities and outline which defenses are effective and which can be defeated or exploited. In the UK penetration testing services are standardized via professional bodies working in collaboration with National Cyber Security Centre.

S. Naipaul set in wartime Trinidad and Tobago. The stories draw on the author's childhood memories of Port of Spain. The author lived with his family in Luis Street in the 1940s, and this has been taken to be the model of Miguel Street. Some of the inhabitants are members of the Hindu community to which Naipaul belonged. Naipaul also draws on wider Trinidadian culture, referring to cricket and quoting a number of lyrics by black calypso singers.Thieme, John, Calypso allusions in Naipaul's Miguel Street, Kunapipi, 3(2), 1981. Available at:http://ro.uow.edu.au/kunapipi/vol3/iss2/5 Plot summary The stories tend each to focus on a single character living on Miguel Street. As the various characters reappear in different stories, which all share the same boy narrator, the book can be seen as a type of novel. Rather like the characters of Dubliners, some of Naipaul's protagonists appear to be affected by a kind of paralysis, for example Mr. Popo the carpenter, who never finishes making anything, and the poet B. Wordsworth, who is working on the greatest poem ever written but has never written past the first line. The narrator however escapes from Miguel Street at the end of the book. Other characters include Bogart (named after Humphrey Bogart), Hat, George, Elias, an assiduous boy, Man-man, Eddoes, a junk king, Mrs. Hereira, Uncle Bhakcu, Bolo, and Edward.  Background to the book's publication  Naipaul wrote the book while employed at the BBC in London. The publisher Andr√© Deutsch hesitated over publishing short stories by an unknown Trinidadian writer, as Naipaul then was. Deutsch thought a novel would have more success, and encouraged Naipaul to write one. Deutsch published Miguel Street after Naipaul's first two novels, The Mystic Masseur and The Suffrage of Elvira, which appeared in 1957 and 1958 respectively.  Reception  Miguel Street won the 1961 Somerset Maugham Award. The New York Times said about Miguel Street, \\"The sketches are written lightly, so that tragedy is understated and comedy is overstated, yet the ring of truth always prevails.\\"Poore, Charles (May 5, 1960) \\"Miguel Street.\\" New York Times.

The company's most successful early line, the 250 series includes many variants designed for road use or sports car racing. 250 series cars are characterized by their use of a Colombo V12 engine designed by Gioacchino Colombo. They were replaced by the 275 and 330 series cars. Early Ferrari 250 cars fitted 16\\" Borrani wheels with either Pirelli Stella Bianca Crossply tyres or 185R16 Cinturato radial tyres. Later road cars fitted 15\\" Borrani wheels and 185R15 Pirelli Cinturato. Similarities Most 250 road cars share the same two wheelbases, for short wheelbase (SWB) and for long wheelbase (LWB). Most convertibles used the SWB type. Nearly all 250s share the same Colombo Tipo 125 V12 engine. At , it was notable for its light weight and impressive output of up to in the Testa Rossa and GTO. The V12 weighed hundreds of pounds less than its chief competitors ‚Äî for example, it was nearly half the weight of the Jaguar XK straight-6. Ferrari uses the displacement of a single cylinder as the model designation. The V12 propelled the Ferrari 250 racing cars to numerous victories. Racing models Typical of Ferrari, the Colombo V12 made its debut on the race track, with the racing 250s preceding the street cars by three years. =250 S= Ferrari 250 S The first 250 was the experimental 250 S berlinetta prototype entered in the 1952 Mille Miglia for Giovanni Bracco and Alfonso Rolfo. The Mercedes-Benz W194 racers of Rudolf Caracciola, Hermann Lang, and Karl Kling were faster on the long straights but the Ferrari made up sufficient ground in the hills and curves to win the race. The car was later entered at Le Mans and in the Carrera Panamericana. The 250 S used a wheelbase with a \\"Tuboscocca\\" tubular trellis frame. Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, with double longitudinal semi-elliptic springs locating the live axle at the rear. The car had the drum brakes and worm-and-sector steering typical of the period. The dry-sump 3.0 L () engine used three Weber 36DCF carburettors and was mated directly to a five-speed manual transmission. =250 MM= Ferrari 250 MM Following the success of the 250 S in the Mille Miglia, Ferrari showed a more conventional chassis for the new 250 engine at the 1952 Paris Motor Show. Pinin Farina then created coup√© bodywork which had a small grille, compact tail and panoramic rear window, and the new car was launched as the 250 MM (for Mille Miglia) at the 1953 Geneva Motor Show. Carrozzeria Vignale's open barchetta version was also an innovative design whose recessed headlights and side vents became a Ferrari staple for the 1950s. 0334MM was the sole chassis with Vignale Berlinetta body, distinctive for its triple portholes on the bottom of front fenders, not on top. The 250 MM's wheelbase was longer than the 250 S at , with the coup√© heavier than the barchetta. The V12 engine's dry sump was omitted from the production car, and the transmission was reduced by one gear. Power was increased to . The four-cylinder 625 TF and 735 S replaced the V12-powered 250 MM later in 1953. The 250 MM's race debut was at the 1953 Giro di Sicilia with privateer Paolo Marzotto. A Carrozzeria Morelli-bodied 250 MM barchetta driven by Clemente Biondetti came fourth in the 1954 Mille Miglia. =250 Monza= 250 Monza : The 1954 250 Monza was an unusual hybrid of the light four-cylinder 500 Mondial and the 250 line. The model used the 250 MM engine in the short-wheelbase chassis from the 500 Mondial. The first three used the Pinin Farina barchetta shape of the 750 Monza and 500 Mondial. One more 250 Monza was built by Carrozzeria Scaglietti, an early use of the now-familiar coachbuilder. The 250 Monzas failed to gain much success and the union of the Monza chassis and 250 engine was not pursued for some time. =250 Testa Rossa= 1958 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa : The racing 250 Testa Rossa was one of the most successful Ferrari racing cars in its history, with three wins at Le Mans, four wins at Sebring, and two wins at Buenos Aires. One example sold at auction for a record-breaking $16.39 million. =250 GTO= Ferrari 250 GTO : The 250 GTO was produced from 1962 to 1964 for homologation into the FIA's Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. GTO stands for \\"Gran Turismo Omologato\\", Italian for \\"Homologated Grand Tourer\\". When new, the GTO sold for $18,500 in the United States, and buyers had to be personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and his dealer for North America, Luigi Chinetti. In May 2012, the 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO chassis number 3505GT sold by an auction for US$38,115,000. In October 2013, the 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO chassis number 5111GT sold by Connecticut-based collector Paul Pappalardo to an unnamed buyer in a private transaction for US$52 million. In August 2018, the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO chassis number 3413GT sold at auction for US$48,405,000. Thirty-six cars were made in 1962 and 1963. In 1964 the Series II was introduced, which had a different body. Three such cars were made, and four older Series I cars were given a Series II body. It brought the total number of GTOs produced to 39. In 2004, Sports Car International placed the 250 GTO eighth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s, and nominated it the top sports car of all time. Motor Trend Classic placed it first on a list of the \\"Greatest Ferraris of all time\\". =250 P= Ferrari 250 P The 250 P was a prototype racer produced in 1963, winning that year's 12 Hours of Sebring, 1000 km N√ºrburgring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 250 P used an engine derived from the 250 Testa Rossa, mounted in a rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive configuration. =250 LM= 1965 250 LM The mid-engined 250 Le Mans looked very much the prototype racer but was intended for production as a road-going GT. Descended from the 250 P, the Le Mans also appeared in 1963 and sported Pininfarina bodywork. Ferrari was unable to persuade the FIA that he would build the 100 examples required to homologate the car for GT racing. Eventually, 32 LMs were built up to 1965. As a result, Ferrari withdrew from factory participation in the GT class of the 1965 World Sportscar Championship, allowing the Shelby Cobra team to dominate. A 250LM, competing in the Prototype category, won the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans. Only the very early LM's were true 250 models. All the others were made as 3.3-litre models, and as such should have been named 275 LM. The early cars were converted to the 3.3-litre engine. GT cars The 250 design was successful both on the road and on the track. A number of GT models were built in varying states of road or racing trim. =250 Europa= Ferrari 250 Europa Pinin Farina Coup√© The 250 Europa, introduced at the 1953 Paris Motor Show, was the only one of the family to use a different engine, sporting the 2963 cc Lampredi V12 based on a design for Formula One 3.3 L engine. It was a square engine, with of bore and stroke, developing at 6,300 rpm, with three Weber 36DCF (or DCZ) carburettors, and mated to a 4-speed transmission. With the long wheelbase and Ferrari 375 America-style bodies, it was designed as a grand tourer. Three different rear axle ratios were offered to customers, providing an estimated top speed between depending on the ratio. Both 250 Europa and 375 America shared the same chassis, wheelbase and mechanicals apart for the engine. The bodywork was designed by Giovanni Michelotti and constructed by Pinin Farina and Vignale. Styling resembled the 375 America and 340 Mexico coupes. 22 were made, including 17 Pinin Farina-built coupes, 4 Vignale coupes, 1 Pinin Farina cabriolet and 1 Vignale cabriolet. Two later were later converted by the Ferrari factory to 375 America specification (chassis 0315AL and 0353EU). =250 Europa GT= 250 Europa GT The first road car to use Colombo's 250 V12 was the 250 Europa GT, introduced at the 1954 Paris Motor Show. It was also the first Ferrari to use the Gran Turismo moniker. Pinin Farina's sober Paris coup√© was just one of many shapes for the 250 GT model line, with coachbuilt production extending through 1956 before the 250 line became more standardized. The original 250 Europa GT used a wheelbase on a conventional chassis, with 600-16 Stella Bianca tyres. The wet sump V12 was tuned to , with three Weber 36DCZ3 carburettors. Echoing Vignale's 250 Europa, Pinin Farina added now-familiar vents to the front fenders, a standard styling cue for many of the 250 GTs that followed. Chassis Nr. 0373 finished third at the Li√®ge-Rome-Li√®ge rally in 1956 =250 GT Coup√© Boano and Ellena= 250 GT Boano, with an all-alloy body built in 1956 Pinin Farina introduced a 250-based prototype coup√© at the 1956 Geneva Motor Show which came to be called the 250 GT Boano. Intended as a styling exercise and inspiration to 250 GT Europa customers, the car generated demand that soon called for a production series. Unable to meet the demand without expansion, Pinin Farina asked Mario Boano, formerly of Ghia, to handle the construction. When Fiat later recruited Boano, he handed production duties to his son-in-law Ezio Ellena. With partner Luciano Pollo, Carrozzeria Ellena would produce the 250 GT for another few years. Ellena revised the car, raising the roof and removing the vent windows from the doors. These examples became known as the 250 GT Ellena. Carrozzeria Boano built 74 250 GTs on the long-wheelbase chassis. Carrozzeria Ellena built another 50 Coup√©s. All but one were coup√©s. The single convertible, 0461 GT, was sold to New York collector Bob Lee off the stand at the 1956 New York Auto Show. At the direction of Enzo Ferrari, Lee bought the car for $9,500, far below cost. He still owns it, making it one of the oldest Ferraris still in the hands of the original purchaser. =250 GT Pinin Farina Coup√© Speciale= Four examples of the 250 GT Coup√© Speciale were made, on the type 513 chassis. (Although chassis numbers were in the middle of the Boano 250 GT Coup√© run they did not share the same chassis type.). They had Series I 410 Superamerica-style bodies and type 128, 3.0 V12 engines. =250 GT Berlinetta \\"Tour de France\\"= 250 GT TdF \\"14 louvre\\" #0677GT, in Ecurie Francorchamps colours, at the 1997 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The original 250 GT Berlinetta, nicknamed the \\"Long Wheelbase Berlinetta\\", was also called the \\"Tour de France\\" after competing in the 10-day Tour de France automobile race. Seventy-seven Tour de France cars were built, of which a number were sold for GT races from 1956 through 1959. Construction was handled by Carrozzeria Scaglietti based on a Pinin Farina design. The engine began at but eventually rose to . Pirelli Cinturato 165R400 tyres (CA67) were standard. At the 1956 Geneva Motor Show, Scaglietti displayed their own 250 GT prototype, which became known as the limited-production, Series I, \\"no-louvre\\" 250 GT Berlinetta. The first customer car was built in May 1956, with production now the responsibility of Scaglietti in Modena. Fourteen \\"no- louvre\\" and nine \\"14-louvre\\" Series I and II Berliettas were made. There were four series of 250 GT Berlinettas. In mid-1957 the Series III cars were introduced, with three louvres and covered headlights. Eighteen were produced. The 36 Series IV cars; retained the covered headlights and had a single vent louvre. Zagato also made five \\"no-louvre\\" superlight cars to Ugo Zagato's design. A 250 GT Berlinetta won Tour de France Automobile three times in 1956, 1957 and 1958. Ferrari's winning streak in this race will be carried over with later 'Interim' and SWB Berlinettas. =250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina Series I= Michael Schumacher rides in a 250 GT Cabriolet Released at the Geneva Motor Show in 1957, the original 250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina Series I used the wheelbase and the body was styled differently from the Berlinetta. Cars left the factory on either 165R400 or 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67). About 36 examples were produced before a second series was shown at Paris in 1959. These later cars had more in common with the production Berlinetta. About 200 of the Series II cars were built. Motor Trend Classic placed the 250 GT Series I Cabriolet and Coup√© ninth on their list of the ten \\"Greatest Ferraris of all time\\". =250 GT California Spyder LWB= 1959 California Spyder LWB Designed for export to North America, the 1957 250 GT California Spyder was Scaglietti's interpretation of an open-top 250 GT. Aluminium was used for the hood, doors, and trunk lid, with steel elsewhere for most models. Several aluminium-bodied racing versions were also built. The engine was the same as in the 250 Tour de France racing car with up to @ 7000 rpm and a maximum torque of @ 5000 rpm, from a naturally aspirated SOHC 2 valves per cylinder 60¬∫ Ferrari Colombo V12 engine, equipped with 3 Weber carburetors. All used the long chassis, and Pirelli Cinturato 185VR16 tyres (CA67) were standard. A total of fifty LWBs were made before the SWB version superseded them in 1960. One example sold at auction on August 18, 2007 in Monterey, California, for $4.9 million.This car was also in Ferris Bueller's Day Off in 1986. While radio host and former Top Gear presenter Chris Evans bought one for $12 million in 2008. =250 GT Coup√© Pinin Farina= 250 GT Coup√© Pinin Farina Needing series production to stabilize his company's finances, Enzo Ferrari asked Pinin Farina to design a simple and classic 250 GT coup√©. After the 250 GT Coup√© Boano/Ellena, Pinin Farina's Grugliasco plant expanded and now had the capacity to produce the new 250 GT Coup√© Pinin Farina. It was introduced at Milan in 1958, and 335 near-identical examples were built by 1960. Buyers included Prince Bertil of Sweden. The GT Coup√© eschewed the fender vents for simple, clean lines and a notchback look with panoramic rear window. The oval grille was replaced by a more traditional long narrow look with protruding headlights. Telescopic shock absorbers were also fitted instead of the Houdailles on previous 250s, and disc brakes were added in 1960. The original 165R400 Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67) were later changed to 185VR16. The final 250 GT Coup√© had a Superfast tail and was shown at the 1961 London Motor Show. =250 GT Berlinetta \\"Interim\\"= Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta Interim In 1959, seven 250 GT \\"Interim\\" LWB Berlinettas were made. They utilized the old long-wheelbase chassis and had the new Pinin Farina bodywork of the upcoming SWB Berlinettas. The bodies are all-aluminum. Interim vehicles have an additional rear quarter window, absent from the succeeding \\"Passo Corto\\" Berlinettas. The Interim vehicles are serial numbers 1377GT, 1461GT, 1465GT, 1509GT, 1519GT, 1521GT and 1523GT. 'Interim' Berlinetta won 1959 Tour de France Automobile, thus continuing Ferrari's dominance. =250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina Series II= 250 GT Cabriolet Pinin Farina, series II In line with the high-volume coup√©, Pinin Farina also designed a plainer 250 GT Cabriolet for series production. Introduced at the 1959 Paris Motor Show, the GT Cabriolet sported a look similar to the GT Coup√© of the previous year, including the removal of the side vents. 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67) were standard. On the Coup√© the headlights were uncovered. About 212 were produced. = 250 GT Berlinetta SWB= Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta SWB Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta SWB 1961 One of the most notable GT racers of its time, the 1959 250 GT Berlinetta SWB used a short () wheelbase for better handling. Of the 176 examples built, both steel and aluminum bodies were used in various road (\\"lusso\\") and racing trims. Engine output ranged from to . The \\"lusso\\" road car version was originally fitted with 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato (CA67).250 GT Berlinetta SWB interior Development of the 250 GT SWB Berlinetta was handled by Giotto Bizzarrini, Carlo Chiti, and young Mauro Forghieri, the same team that later produced the 250 GTO. Disc brakes were a first on a Ferrari GT, and the combination of low weight, high power, and well-sorted suspension made it competitive. It was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in October and quickly began selling and racing. The SWB Berlinetta won Ferrari the GT class of the 1961 Constructor's Championship. Also won 1960, 1961 and 1962 Tour de France Automobile before giving ground to the GTO's. In 2004, Sports Car International placed the 250 GT SWB seventh on a list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s, and Motor Trend Classic placed it fifth on a list of the ten \\"Greatest Ferraris of all time\\". = 250 GT California Spyder SWB= Ferrari 250 GT SWB In 1959 Ferrari gave the 250 GT Berlinetta sharper handling, reducing its wheelbase from 2,600 mm to 2,400 mm. In 1960, Scaglietti revealed the 250 GT California Spyder SWB at the Geneva Motor Show, its body pulled more tautly over this updated chassis. Like the 250 GT Berlinetta SWB on which it was based, the revised Spyder also received disc brakes and a version of the three-litre V12. It was fitted with 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67). About 55 were built. The new 2400 mm chassis (taken from the 250 GT Berlinetta SWB) enabled the body of this new version of the California Spyder to be lower, reducing the overall height by 30 mm. However this is very difficult to see. The easiest ways to tell the difference between the \\"passo lungo\\" (LWB) version and the \\"passo corto\\" (SWB) version of the California Spyder is to look at the hood scoop and the vents on sides of the front fenders. The hood scoop is much lower on the SWB version. A custom- built fiberglass-bodied replica of a 1961‚Äì1963 250 GT California Spyder, was featured in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Three 1985 Modena Spyders (two running and one shell for destruction) were built for the film by Modena Design & Development on custom frames. One of the running models was sold back to Modena for restoration and in April 2018 became the 22nd vehicle added to the National Historic Vehicle Register. A 1961 SWB example that had been owned by James Coburn was sold for ¬£5.5 million to radio DJ, Chris Evans. A barn find 1961 SWB formerly owned by French actor Alain Delon while he was making the film Les Felins with Jane Fonda sold for US$15.9 million in February 2015. On March 11, 2016 at the Omni Amelia Island Plantation, a 1961 SWB sold for US$17.16 million at auction. =250 GT/E= 1963 250 GTE #4823 GT The LWB 250 GT theme was expanded with the 2+2 model 250 GT/E, the first large-production four-seat Ferrari (earlier four-seaters were made in very small numbers). Interior space was increased by moving the engine forward in the chassis. The rear seats were suitable for children but small for adults. Pirelli Cinturato 185VR15 tyres (CA67) were original equipment. The standard wheels used on series 1 & 2 were the Borrani RW3591 and the series 3 were fitted with the Borrani RW3690 as a standard.Borrani Ferrari 250 GTE 2+2 Wheels https://www.borrani.com/ferrari-wheels/250-gte-2-2.html Engine output was listed at . Almost 1,000 GT/Es were constructed by Pininfarina with prototypes starting in 1959 and continuing through three series until 1963. The model was followed by the visually similar 330 America, which shared the 250 GT/E's chassis but used the larger 4.0 L engine of the 330 series. The large production run of the GT/E was a major contributor to Ferrari's financial well-being in the early 1960s. MSRP of the GT/E was $11,500. A 250 GT/E can be seen in The Wrong Arm of the Law, a film starring Peter Sellers. =250 GT Berlinetta Lusso= 1964 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso Pininfarina updated the 250 GT with the GT Lusso or GTL. Introduced at the 1962 Paris show, the car had flowing lines and a fastback shape typical of the GT cars of the mid-1960s. The engine was the 250 GTO's Tipo 168 with and three Weber 36DCS carburettors. 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67) were standard. Built by Scaglietti, the Lusso continued through 1964 with few modifications. Rock star Eric Clapton owned one, and an example that had been owned by Steve McQueen sold at auction for $2.3 million on 16 August 2007. In 2004, Sports Car International placed the 250 GT Lusso tenth on a list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s.

G'nort is a member of the Green Lantern Corps and later a Darkstar and a member of the Justice League Antarctica. He resembles an anthropomorphic dog and is thoroughly incompetent and generally disliked by other heroes; in fact, he is usually portrayed as being a loser and used as comic relief. Publication history G'nort first appeared in Justice League International #10 and was created by Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis. during their Justice League period. His name was originally spelled Gnort; his semi-human face, manner of speech, and style of dress showed that the inspiration for the character was sewer worker Ed Norton, played by Art Carney in the classic television series The Honeymooners. However, in later appearances, his face became more canine and the spelling of his name was changed. Fictional character biography Hal Jordan explains that G'nort became a Green Lantern due to the influence of his relative who was a famous member of the Lantern Corps. Despite his obviously limited intelligence (not intelligent enough to read a map) and profoundly lacking tactical judgment, the character is consistently depicted as brave, loyal, and honorable. This fact is overlooked by most heroes, although Superman has pointed it out on occasion. Early in his career, G'nort becomes inadvertently mixed up with the League's battle against the Manhunters. Recognizing G'Nort's general incompetence, the Corps had given him an uninhabited sector of space to patrol. The fact that the region was uninhabited also suited the needs of the Manhunters, who set up their home planet in G'Nort's sector. G'Nort joined Hal Jordan, Superman, and other Justice League members in an assault on the home world, although G'Nort's main contribution was getting stuck in the planet's ventilation system. =Working with the League= Gnort's arch enemy, the Scarlet Skier (a take-off of Marvel's Silver Surfer), is described as being the only felon G'nort ever managed to apprehend in his entire career. Also an idiot, the Skier was mistaken for a pan-handling homeless person when traveling in the subway. G'nort goes on a mission to rescue Mister Miracle from the interstellar trader Manga Khan. Traveling in a spaceship, G'nort works with Big Barda, Martian Manhunter, and Dmitri of the Rocket Reds. They chase down Khan and survive an assassination attempt by his hired killer Lobo.Justice League International #14-16 (June‚ÄìAugust 1988) Both G'nort and the Skier were founding members of Justice League Antarctica, created by Maxwell Lord for the purpose of keeping both them and the reformed Injustice League out of his way. The League, including G'nort, find their Antarctic headquarters overwhelmed by killer penguins. Their enemies are ultimately destroyed, but not before the facility itself gets demolished. G'Nort keeps himself and his new-found allies alive via his power-ring until help arrives.Justice League America Annual #4 (1990) G'nort assists the League, this time consisting of Manhunter, Crimson Fox and Ice, when Mr. Nebula, the Skier's old boss, turns his dangerous, cosmic-powered attention to Earth. Mr. Nebula saw the garishness of Las Vegas and thought Earth had the same taste as he and thus left.Justice League Quarterly #2 (April 1991) G'nort sees himself as a \\"Green-Lantern-at-large\\", not bound to a single space sector. His most successful mission (apart from capturing the Skier) has been when a gang of interstellar bank-robbing humanoid cats surrender as soon as he appears. =Qward battle= Eventually it is discovered that both G'nort and his uncle G'newman were actually given their rings by the Poglachians, who posed as the Guardians of the Universe while the real Guardians were with the Zamarons. A race of clowns, the Poglachians gave the rings to beings they thought would use them in amusing ways. They were actually pawns of the Weaponers of Qward, who hoped to discredit the Green Lantern Corps by having the name associated with idiots. G'nort works with Guy Gardner, ending up in Qward itself,Green Lantern #12 (May 1991) though G'nort loses his Qwardian-powered ring. Their confrontations against a Qwardian Sinestro cult goes badly. Faced with the threat of his beloved uncle being killed, G'nort gives up the location of Hal Jordan. Soon after, powerless but free from a Qwardian cell, G'nort smells the soldier who took his ring and tracks him down. The soldier swiftly overpowers G'nort and makes the mistake of bragging how he would torture and kill Guy. Enraged, G'nort defeats the soldier, gains his ring and saves Guy by destroying the source of his very own power. The two make it back to normal space as explosions devastate the local area. Afterwards, Guy Gardner reluctantly tells the real Guardians that G'nort was the true hero on Qward, which earned G'nort status as a genuine Green Lantern.Green Lantern #13 (June 1991) Around this time G'Nort is kicked out of the League and meets up with a struggling street musician whom he takes to calling 'Sax Girl'.Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #1 (Summer 1992) He saves her from a life of homelessness and they have multiple adventures together. They part on friendly terms, with a kiss.Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #5 (June 1993) He has other adventures on his own, such as battling several supervillains who pretend to terrorize a small town for a cut of tourism dollars. =Post-League= G'nort presumably lost his ring during Emerald Twilight and subsequently (like many former Lanterns) joined the Darkstars. He still wears his Darkstar uniform long after the organization collapses, when he is captured by Manga Khan, who attempts to trade him to Maxwell Lord in exchange for L-Ron. The entire situation goes badly, resulting in the near-destruction of Earth. G'Nort is set free after Maxwell Lord and Sue Dibny hold Khan for ransom. L-Ron returns with Khan. He is persuaded to form a 'Super Buddies Of Antarctica' branch and is seen trying to hitch a ride.Formerly Known as the Justice League #1-6 (September 2003-February 2004) G'nort was seen as the sole member of Super Buddies Antarctica, exactly where Maxwell Lord wants him. For a time, G'Nort lives behind Guy Gardner's New York 'Warriors' bar.Green Lantern 80-Page Giant #1 (December 1998) He appeared later in the mini-series \\"Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage\\", where his homeworld had been destroyed by the Rann-Thanagar War. The character was portrayed more serious in this story, suffering heavily from the loss of his family.Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage #1-2 (June‚ÄìJuly 2006) As of Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Secret Files & Origins #1, G'nort is listed as \\"Presumed Dead\\".Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Secret Files & Origins (February 2008) When asked whether G'nort would be making an appearance as a member of the Black Lantern Corps during Blackest Night at San Diego Comic Con 2009, Geoff Johns replied that the character was not dead and was still considered missing in action.CCI LIVE: Green Lantern Blackest Night Panel, Comic Book Resources, July 25, 2009 In The New 52, in the final events of the 2013 \\"Wrath of the First Lantern\\" storyline, G'nort appears and helps prevent the Red Lanterns from attacking the Green Lantern Corps during the battle against the villainous First Lantern.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #20 (May 2013) =Larfleeze= G'nort reappears in response to a distress call made by the robot inhabitants of a planet seized by Larfleeze.

There, G'nort is a rampaging flea-infested giant whose body is used as a battleground. =Justice League Unlimited= In the Justice League Unlimited comic spin-off G'nort starts his career as a regular Green Lantern Cadet, nephew of the famous G'Newt but lacking any skills and talents. He is brought to Qward by John Stewart along with other Lanterns to stop Sinestro's last plan to destroy Oa by flaring over the planet with antimatter bursts. Despite Boodikka's prejudices against a rookie, G'nort is able to hold his own in combat, and uncover G'Newt himself as Sinestro's partner and accomplice. The Guardians, impressed by his courage, grant him the former sector of the deposed G'Newt to patrol. =Planetary= In an alternate universe ruled by evil versions of the 'Planetary' heroes, G'Nort is one of the many dead Green Lanterns on display in the Planetary headquarters.Planetary JLA: Terra Occulta (November 2002) In other media =Television= * G'nort appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Eyes of Despero\\" voiced by Alexander Polinsky. He, Sinestro, and Guy Gardner work with Batman to stop Despero. His backstory is the same as originally presented in the comics, as Sinestro mentions G'nort's uncle had \\"pushed\\" him through Lantern training. Though G'nort is initially presented as somewhat incompetent, he proves vital in helping Batman stop the brainwashed Mogo by draining Mogo's internal Lantern Battery. Despite forgetting the Green Lantern oath necessary to begin the process, he comes through upon consulting the \\"cheat sheet\\" written on his arm. After Batman compliments him twice and helps G'nort earn the respect of the Corps, he jumps into his arms to lick him, only to get a reprimand (\\"No licking.\\").

He is dressed in a cross-collared robe (√°o giao lƒ©nh) which was commonly worn by all social castes of Vietnam before the 19th century For centuries, peasant women typically wore a halter top () underneath a blouse or overcoat, alongside a skirt (v√°y). Aristocrats, on the other hand, favored a cross-collared robe called √°o giao lƒ©nh, which bore resemblance to historical Chinese clothing. In 1744, Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Kho√°t of Hu·∫ø decreed that both men and women at his court wear trousers and a gown with buttons down the front. The members of the southern court were thus distinguished from the courtiers of the Tr·ªãnh Lords in Hanoi, who wore √°o giao lƒ©nh with long skirts. Chinese Qing style clothing was forced on Vietnamese people by the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty.http://angelasancartier.net/ao-dai-vietnams-national- dresshttp://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/clothing-types-styles/ao-dai The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (Ë£ô) or chang (Ë£≥) which is a part of Chinese garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Qing dynasty clothing was referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Kho√°t (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Tri·ªáu dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords. = 19th century = The √°o ng≈© th√¢n had two flaps sewn together in the back, two flaps sewn together in the front, and a \\"baby flap\\" hidden underneath the main front flap. The gown appeared to have two-flaps with slits on both sides, features preserved in the later ao dai. Compared to a modern ao dai, the front and back flaps were much broader and the fit looser and much shorter. It had a high collar and was buttoned in the same fashion as a modern ao dai.

In 1930, Hanoi artist C√°t T∆∞·ªùng, also known as Le Mur, designed a dress inspired by the √°o ng≈© th√¢n and by Paris fashions. It reached to the floor and fit the curves of the body by using darts and a nipped-in waist. When fabric became inexpensive, the rationale for multiple layers and thick flaps disappeared. Modern textile manufacture allows for wider panels, eliminating the need to sew narrow panels together. The √°o d√†i Le Mur, or \\"trendy\\" ao dai, created a sensation when model Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã H·∫≠u wore it for a feature published by the newspaper Today in January 1935.. For a picture of the √°o d√†i Le Mur, see Ao Dai ‚Äî The Soul of Vietnam. The style was promoted by the artists of T·ª± L·ª±c vƒÉn ƒëo√†n (\\"Self-Reliant Literary Group\\") as a national costume for the modern era. The painter L√™ Ph√¥ introduced several popular styles of ao dai beginning in 1934. Such Westernized garments temporarily disappeared during World War II (1939‚Äì45). In the 1950s, Saigon designers tightened the fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Tr·∫ßn Kim of Thi·∫øt L·∫≠p Tailors and D≈©ng of D≈©ng Tailors created a dress with raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored √°o d√†i hippy was introduced in 1968.Bich Vy-Gau Gi, Ao Dai ‚Äî The Soul of Vietnam. Retrieved on July 2, 2008. The √°o d√†i mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.  Communist period  The ao dai has always been more common in the South than in the North. The communists, who gained power in the North in 1954 and in the South in 1975, had conflicted feelings about the ao dai. They praised it as a national costume and one was worn to the Paris Peace Conference (1969‚Äì73) by Vietcong negotiator Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã B√¨nh. Yet Westernized versions of the dress and those associated with \\"decadent\\" Saigon of the 1960s and early 1970s were condemned. Economic crisis, famine, and war with Cambodia combined to make the 1980s a fashion low point. The ao dai was rarely worn except at weddings and other formal occasions, with the older, looser-fitting style preferred. Overseas Vietnamese, meanwhile, kept tradition alive with \\"Miss Ao Dai\\" pageants (Hoa H·∫≠u √Åo D√†i), the most notable one held annually in Long Beach, California. The ao dai experienced a revival beginning in late 1980s, when state enterprise and schools began adopting the dress as a uniform again. In 1989, 16,000 Vietnamese attended a Miss Ao Dai Beauty Contest held in Ho Chi Minh City. When the Miss International Pageant in Tokyo gave its \\"Best National Costume\\" award to an ao dai-clad Tr∆∞·ªùng Qu·ª≥nh Mai in 1995, Th·ªùi Trang Tr·∫ª (New Fashion Magazine) claimed that Vietnam's \\"national soul\\" was \\"once again honored\\". An \\"ao dai craze\\" followed that lasted for several years and led to wider use of the dress as a school uniform.  Present day  Men in formal attire-Marie Antoinette Boullard-Dev√© Old man wearing traditionally √°o d√†i and khƒÉn v·∫•n in Saigon, T·∫øt 1963. No longer deemed politically controversial, ao dai fashion design is supported by the Vietnamese government. It is often called √°o d√†i Vi·ªát Nam to link it to patriotic feelings. Designer Le Si Hoang is a celebrity in Vietnam and his shop in Saigon is the place to visit for those who admire the dress. In Hanoi, tourists get fitted with ao dai on Luong Van Can Street. The elegant city of Hu·∫ø in the central region is known for its ao dai, n√≥n l√° (traditional leaf hats), and well-dressed women. The ao dai is now a standard for weddings, for celebrating T·∫øt and for other formal occasions. It's the required uniform for female teachers (mostly from high school to below) and female students in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or pattern for teachers while students use plain white with some small patterns like flowers for school uniform. Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it. The most popular style of ao dai fits tightly around the wearer's upper torso, emphasizing her bust and curves. Although the dress covers the entire body, it is thought to be provocative, especially when it is made of thin fabric. \\"The ao dai covers everything, but hides nothing\\", according to one saying. The dress must be individually fitted and usually requires several weeks for a tailor to complete. An ao dai costs about $200 in the United States and about $40 in Vietnam. \\"Symbolically, the ao dai invokes nostalgia and timelessness associated with a gendered image of the homeland for which many Vietnamese people throughout the diaspora yearn,\\" wrote Nhi T. Lieu, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The difficulties of working while wearing an ao dai link the dress to frailty and innocence, she wrote. Vietnamese writers who favor the use of the ao dai as a school uniform cite the inconvenience of wearing it as an advantage, a way of teaching students feminine behavior such as modesty, caution, and a refined manner. The ao dai is featured in an array of Asian-themed or related movies. In Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Robin Williams's character is wowed by ao dai-clad women when he first arrives in Saigon. The 1992 films Indochine and The Lover inspired several international fashion houses to design ao dai collections, including Prada's SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film The White Silk Dress (2007), an ao dai is the sole legacy that the mother of a poverty-stricken family has to pass on to her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an ao dai-inspired design. Vietnamese designers created ao dai for the contestants in the Miss Universe beauty contest, which was held July 2008 in Nha Trang, Vietnam. The costumes worn by Katara, Princess Yue, and Mai from Avatar: The Last Airbender were based on Aoi Dais. The most prominent annual Ao Dai Festival outside of Vietnam is held each year in San Jose, California, a city that is home to a large Vietnamese American community.http://aodaifestival.com This event features an international array of designer ao dai under the direction of festival founder, Jenny Do.  The modern ao dai  No longer deemed politically controversial, ao dai fashion design is supported by the Vietnamese government Fast pace of life in Vietnam during the decades of integration and development witnesses the changes in the traditional ao dai. This does not mean that the traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. Yet, it is becoming more adaptable to these modern days. The growing of the country day by day requires the changing and the ability of adapting. The traditional ao dai is not the exception. It is not because the design of the ao dai does not fit to the aesthetic point of view of modern Vietnamese. Actually, because the traditional ao dai is inconvenient in daily life, it must be ‚Äúmodernized‚Äù. Indeed, the design of the ao dai is no longer suitable for working or travelling on transportation. Moreover, the extreme weather in Viet Nam makes citizens uncomfortable when wearing the ao dai. Besides, it is wardrobe malfunction that causes to the fear of wearing the ao dai in daily activities. Thus, people change the ao dai in its designs and materials so that wearers find it more comfortable and convenient. The modern ao dai turned up several years ago. However, the ao dai was a concern of people who need to wear it as a uniform such as: teacher, flight attendance, receptionists. It was not until the end of the year 2016 did the modern ao dai become so popular with hundreds of new designs. It is modified in the collar, the sleeves or the length of two flaps. Furthermore, instead of wearing pants with the ao dai, people nowadays prefer to wear culottes and skirts inside it. Not only the change in designs, people also use different materials for the modern ao dai like silk, brocade fabric or voile fabric. Along with the wave of the modern ao dai, there is criticism about these transformation. People who want to reserve traditional value in the ao dai argue that the modern ao dai is miscellaneous. Mr. Duc Hung, Vietnamese famous designer, also raised his opinion about this issue: ‚ÄúI do assert that it is not the ao dai of Viet Nam. If we continue to advocate the trend of the modern ao dai, the traditional ao dai will be buried in oblivion‚Ä¶‚Äù. In spite of this, there are still a lot of favor from Vietnamese youngsters to the modern ao dai.

The range of Yiddish theatre is broad: operetta, musical comedy, and satiric or nostalgic revues; melodrama; naturalist drama; expressionist and modernist plays. At its height, its geographical scope was comparably broad: from the late 19th century until just before World War II, professional Yiddish theatre could be found throughout the heavily Jewish areas of Eastern and East Central Europe, but also in Berlin, London, Paris, Buenos Aires and New York City. Yiddish theatre's roots include the often satiric plays traditionally performed during religious holiday of Purim (known as Purim spiels); other masquerades such as the Dance of Death; the singing of cantors in the synagogues; Jewish secular song and dramatic improvisation; exposure to the theatre traditions of various European countries, and the Jewish literary culture that had grown in the wake of the Jewish enlightenment (Haskalah). Israil Bercovici wrote that it is through Yiddish theatre that \\"Jewish culture entered in dialogue with the outside world,\\" both by putting itself on display and by importing theatrical pieces from other cultures.Bercovici, 1998, 103. Themes such as immigration, poverty, integration, and strong ancestral ties can be found in many Yiddish theatre productions. Sources in traditional Jewish culture Noah Prilutski (1882‚Äì1941) noted that Yiddish theatre did not arise simultaneously with theatre in other European \\"national\\" languages; he conjectured that this was at least in part because the Jewish sense of nationality favored Hebrew over Yiddish as a \\"national\\" language, but few Jews of the period were actually comfortable using Hebrew outside of a religious/liturgical context.Bercovici, 1998, 18. Nonetheless, various types of performances, including those of cantors, preachers, jesters, and instrumental musicians, were a part of Eastern European Jewish life long before the formal advent of Yiddish theatre.Steinlauf, Michael C. (October 27, 2010). \\"Theater: Yiddish Theater.\\" YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe (online version). November 25, 2017. Bercovici suggests that, as with ancient Greek drama, elements of dramatic performance arose in Jewish life as an artistic refinement of religious practice; he highlights references in the Bible to dance, music, or song, especially in the Psalms (Hebrew tehillim, or songs of praise), where some of the headings refer to musical instruments, or to singing in dialogue, either between parts of the choir, or between the choir and the leader of the ritual (Hebrew menatseach).Berkovitsh (1976), p. 19 (in Yiddish). Also, traditional dances were associated with certain holidays, such as Sukkot.Bercovici, 1998, 18‚Äì19. Purim plays - the skits performed by amateur companies around the time of the Purim holiday - were a significant early form of theatrical expression. Often satiric and topical, Purim plays were traditionally performed in the courtyard of the synagogue, because they were considered too profane to be performed inside the building. These made heavy use of masks and other theatrical devices; the masquerade (and the singing and dancing) generally extended to the whole congregation, not just a small set of players. While many Purim plays told the story in the Book of Esther commemorated by the Purim holiday, others used other stories from Jewish scripture, such as the story of Joseph sold by his brothers or the sacrifice of Isaac. Over time, these well-known stories became less a subject matter than a pretext for topical and satiric theatre. Mordechai became a standard role for a clown.Bercovici, 1998, 24, 27 Purim plays were published as early as the early 18th century. At least eight Purim plays were published between 1708 and 1720; most of these do not survive (at least some were burned in autos da fe), but one survives in the J√ºdische Merkw√ºrdigkeiten (1714), a collection by Johann Jakob Schudt (1664‚Äì1722).Bercovici, 1998, 26, 28.Wiernik, Peter, and Richard Gottheil (1903). \\"Drama, Yiddish.\\" Jewish Encyclopedia. New York: Funk & Wagnalls. Vol. 4, p. 653-654. Online version (1901‚Äì1906); retrieved 2016-05-16. Another similar current in Jewish culture was a tradition of masked dancers performing after weddings. The most elaborate form of this was the Dance of Death, a pageant depicting all layers of a society, which had originated among Sephardic Jews in Spain in the 14th century and had spread through Europe among both Jews and Gentiles. 16th-century Italian Jews had taken music and dance to an even more refined level of art: at that time in Italy there were Jewish virtuosi and dancing masters in Mantua, Ferrara, and Rome, and the first known troupes of Jewish performers in Europe. Less refined versions of the same also occurred in 18th-century Germany.Bercovici, 1998, 25, 27 Additionally, there was a rich tradition of dialogues in the Jewish poetry known as Tahkemoni, dating back at least to Yehuda al-Harizi in 12th-century Spain. Al-Harizi's work contained dialogues between believer and heretic, man and wife, day and night, land and ocean, wisdom and foolishness, avarice and generosity. Such dialogues figured prominently in early Yiddish theatre.Bercovici, 1998, 23 In the journal Nostalgia in Jewish-American Theatre and Film, 1979-2004, Ben Furnish establishes the deep roots of nostalgia based on Jewish history. Many of these origins are based in stories like that of the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE) of Jews from the Holy Land. Shows up to present day productions pull influence from these experiences, creating a concrete picture of Yiddish themes and tenets seen in Jewish theatre. The origin of theatre in Christian societies in Europe is often traced to Passion Plays and other religious pageants, similar in some ways to the Purim plays. In the Middle Ages, few Jews would have seen these: they were often performed in the courtyards of Christian churches (few of which were near the Jewish ghettos), on Christian holidays, and they often had significant antisemitic elements in their plots and dialogue. However, in later times, the Romanian Orthodox Christmas tradition of Irozii ‚Äî minstrel shows centered around the figure of Herod the Great (Rom: Irod), which were the origin of Romanian-language theatre ‚Äî definitely influenced Purim plays and vice versa. Jews had far more exposure to secular European theatre once that developed. Meistersinger Hans Sachs' many plays on Old Testament topics were widely admired by the Jews of the German ghettos, and from the 16th century through the 18th, the biblical story of Esther was the most popular theatrical theme in Christian Europe, often under the Latin name Acta Ahasuerus.Bercovici, 1998, 25‚Äì26, 47 Early years (pre-1876) Professional Yiddish theatre is generally dated from 1876, although there is scattered evidence of earlier efforts. Besides some 19 amateur Yiddish-language theatrical troupes in and around Warsaw in the 1830s, there was also, according to one contemporary source, a professional company that in 1838 performed before a receptive audience of both Jews and Gentiles a five-act drama Moses, by a certain A. Schertspierer of Vienna, with \\"well-drawn characters and good dramatic situations and language.\\"Bercovici, 1998, p. 30. Bercovici cites a contemporaneous account published in the Allgemeine Preussische Staatszeitung, Nr. 341, 6.XII.1838, apparently recounting an article that appeared November 12, 1838 in a Frankfurt am Main paper.The source of the quotation and details given by Bercovici is evidently the same newspaper article that is cited by Wiernik and Gottheil (1903), Jewish Encyclopedia, with reference to the performances of Schertspierer's Moses in Warsaw: Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums, 1838, issue 155 (December 27). The same source relates that this theatre had among its patrons a number of Russian military officers, including one general who was considered a \\"protector\\" of it - a circumstance that suggests the difficulties it faced. Thalia Theatre poster (Josef Kroger, New York, 1897) Around the same time, there are indications of a traveling Yiddish-language theatre troupe in Galicia, organized along the lines of an English or Italian theatre troupe.Bercovici, 1998, 29 In 1854, two rabbinical students from Zhytomyr put on a play in Berdichev. Shortly afterward, the Ukrainian Jew Abraham Goldfaden, generally considered the founder of the first professional Yiddish theatre troupe, attended that same rabbinical school, and while there is known to have played (in 1862) a woman's role in a play, Serkele, by Solomon Ettinger. Shortly after that (1869, according to one source), Goldfaden wrote a dialogue Tsvey Shkheynes (Two Neighbors), apparently intended for the stage, and published with moderate success.Sandrow 2003, 9‚Äì10Partial list of plays by Goldfaden on 4-wall.com. A short-lived Yiddish theater in Odessa in 1864 performed dramas Esther and Athalia. Abraham Baer Gottlober's Decktuch, like Ettinger's Serkele, was written between 1830 and 1840, but published much later; Israel Aksenfeld (died c. 1868) wrote several dramas in Yiddish, which were probably not staged in his lifetime. Another early Yiddish dramatist was Joel Baer Falkovich (Reb Chaimele der Ko·∫ìin, Odessa, 1866; Rochel die Singerin, Zhytomyr, 1868). Solomon Jacob Abramowitsch's Die Takse (1869) has the form of a drama, but, like Eliakim Zunser's later Mekirat Yosef (Vilnius, 1893), it was not intended for the stage. Hersh Leib Sigheter (1829‚Äì1930) wrote satirical Purim plays on an annual basis and hired boys to play in them. Although often objected to by rabbis, these plays were popular, and were performed not only on Purim but for as much as a week afterwards in various locations.Bercovici, 1998, 28 Another current that led equally to professional Yiddish theatre was a tradition resembling that of the troubadours or Minnes√§nger, apparently growing out of the music associated with Jewish weddings, and often involving singers who also functioned as cantors in synagogues. The first records of the early Broders√§nger or Broder singers are the remarks of Jews passing through Brody, which was on a major route of travel, generally disapproving of the singing of songs when no particular occasion called for music. The most famous of the singers from Brody was the itinerant Berl Margulis (1815‚Äì1868), known as Berl Broder, \\"Berl from Brody\\"; 24 of his 30 surviving songs are in the form of dialogues. Another influential performer in this style was Benjamin Wolf Ehrenkrantz (1826‚Äì1883), known as Velvel Zbarjer. Bercovici describes his work as \\"mini-melodramas in song\\".Byli tu anebo sp√≠≈° nebyli (in Czech)Bercovici, 1998, 31‚Äì37 Such performers, who performed at weddings, in the salons of the wealthy, in the summer gardens, and in other secular gathering places of the Eastern European Jews, were not mere singers. They often used costumes and often improvised spoken material between songs, especially when working in groups. Israel Grodner, later Goldfaden's first actor, participated in an outdoor concert in Odessa in 1873 with dialogues between songs comparable to much of what was in Goldfaden's earliest plays. Goldfaden himself was already a noted poet, and many of his poems had been set to music and had become popular songs, some of which were used in that 1873 performance.Bercovici, 1998, 31‚Äì37, 59 Finally, around this time Yiddish was establishing itself as a literary language, and some Jews with secular interests were familiar with the dominant theatrical traditions of their respective countries; given this burgeoning literary intellectual culture, within a year or two of Goldfaden's founding the first professional Yiddish theatre troupe, there were multiple troupes, multiple playwrights, and more than a few serious Yiddish theatre critics and theoreticians.Bercovici, 1998, passim. Goldfaden and the birth of Yiddish theatre in Romania Abraham Goldfaden is generally considered the founder of the first professional Yiddish theatre troupe, which he founded in Ia≈üi, Romania in 1876, and later moved to Bucharest. His own career also took him to Imperial Russia, Lemberg in Habsburg Galicia (today Lviv in Ukraine), and New York City. Within two years of Goldfaden's founding of his troupe, there were several rival troupes in Bucharest, mostly founded by former members of Goldfaden's troupe. Most of these troupes followed Goldfaden's original formula of musical vaudeville and light comedy, while Goldfaden himself turned more toward relatively serious operettas about biblical and historical subjects, especially after his own company left Bucharest for an extended tour of the cities of Imperial Russia. Goldfaden's troupe began as all-male; while they soon acquired actresses, as well, it remained relatively common in Yiddish theatre for female roles, especially comic roles, to be played by men. (Women also sometimes played men's roles: Molly Picon was a famous Shmendrick.) Many early Yiddish theatre pieces were constructed around a very standard set of roles: \\"a prima donna, a soubrette, a comic, a lover, a villain, a villainess (or \\"intriguer\\"), an older man and woman for character roles, and one or two more for spares as the plot might require,\\" and a musical component that might range from a single fiddler to an orchestra.Sandrow, 2003, 11 This was very convenient for a repertory company, especially a traveling one. Both at the start and well into the great years of Yiddish theatre, the troupes were often in one or another degree family affairs, with a husband, wife, and often their offspring playing in the same troupe. At its high end, early Yiddish theatre was noted for its pageantry. A pageant about the coronation of Solomon, presented on the occasion of the 1881 coronation of Carol I of Romania was described by Ion Ghica as \\"among the most imposing things that paraded the coronation\\"; he acquired the costumes for the Romanian National Theatre, which he headed at the time.Bercovici, 1998, 73‚Äì74 Both the nature and aspirations of early professional Yiddish theatre are reflected in Moses Schwarzfeld's 1877 remarks calling for serious and \\"educational\\" Jewish theatre: \\"If we write only comedies or if we only imitate German, Romanian and French pieces translated into Yiddish, all we will have is a secondary Jewish stage ... just making people laugh and cry is an evil for us Jews in Romania.\\"Cited in Bercovici, 1998, 71‚Äì72 Goldfaden himself agreed with such sentiments; later recalling his views at the time, he wrote: \\"If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you ... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you shall also cry ‚Äî while my heart shall be glad.\\"Cited in Bercovici, 1998, 68Cited in: David A. Brenner (2008), German-Jewish Popular Culture Before the Holocaust: Kafka's Kitsch (Oxford: Routledge), p. 19. B. Nathansohn, correspondent of the Warsaw-based Jewish newspaper Hamelitz visited Romania in the summer of 1878 and wrote, \\"When a Jew enters a Yiddish theatre in Bucharest he is thunderstruck hearing the Yiddish language in all its splendor and radiance\\", and called upon Goldfaden to create similar theatres in Warsaw, Lublin, Vilna, Berdichev, and Balta.cited at Bercovici, 1998, 72 While Yiddish theatre was an immediate hit with the broad masses of Jews, was generally liked and admired by Jewish intellectuals and many Gentile intellectuals, a small but socially powerful portion of the Jewish community, centered among Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, remained opposed to it. Besides complaints about the mingling of men and women in public and about the use of music and dance outside of sacred contexts, the two main criticisms from this quarter were (1) that the Yiddish \\"jargon\\" was being promoted to the detriment of \\"proper\\" Hebrew and (2) that satire against Hasidim and others would not necessarily be understood as satire and would make Jews look ridiculous. Bercovici quotes an anonymous 1885 article as responding to these criticisms by saying (1) that all Jews speak some modern language and why should Yiddish be any more detrimental to Hebrew than Romanian, Russian, or German, and (2) that the Gentiles who would come to Yiddish theatre would not be the antisemites, they would be those who already knew and liked Jews, and that they would recognize satire for what it was, adding that these criticisms were \\"nothing\\" when weighed against the education that Yiddish theatre was bringing to the lower classes.Bercovici, 1998, 82‚Äì83 Writing of Sigmund Mogulesko's troupe in Romania in 1884, and probably referring to the plays of Moses Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner, Moses Gaster wrote that Yiddish theatre \\"represents scenes from our history known by only a tiny minority, refreshing, therefore, secular memory\\" and \\"shows us our defects, which we have like all men, but not with a tendency to strike at our own immorality with a tendency towards ill will, but only with an ironic spirit that does not wound us, as we are wounded by representations on other stages, where the Jew plays a degrading role.\\"Bercovici, 1998, 79 Goldfaden's plays ultimately formed a canon of Yiddish theater, and were performed continuously for over fifty years; in the theatre world they were reverently regarded as a kind of \\"Torah from Sinai\\", and the characters of the plays permeated Jewish cultural life over several generations. Yiddish theatre in Russia Poster for Jewmuzdramcomedy (Jewish theatre). Moscow, Russia, 1920 If Yiddish theatre was born in Romania, its youth occurred in Imperial Russia, largely in what is now Ukraine. Israel Rosenberg's troupe (which later had a series of managers, including Goldfaden's brother Tulya, and which at one point split in two, with one half led by actor Jacob Adler) gave Russia's first professional Yiddish theatre performance in Odessa in 1878. Goldfaden himself soon came to Odessa, pushing Rosenberg's troupe into the provinces, and Osip Mikhailovich Lerner and N.M. Sheikevitch also founded a Yiddish theatre at Odessa, which for several years became the capital of Yiddish theatre.Adler, 1999, passim Russia offered a more sophisticated audience than rural Romania: many Russian Jews were regular attendees of Russian-language theatre, and Odessa was a first- rate theatre city. In this context, serious melodramatic operettas, and even straight plays, took their place in the repertoire among the lighter vaudevilles and comedies that had thus far predominated. All three major troupes in Odessa did their own productions of Karl Gutzkow's play Uriel Acosta (with Goldfaden's production being an operetta). However, even this increased sophistication could not compare to later, more ambitious efforts of the Yiddish theater. Looking back on this period, although acknowledging certain of Goldfaden's plays from this era as \\"masterpieces\\", Jacob Adler saw this as a period of relative mediocrity compared to what came later. \\"For three years I... wandered in the cave of the Witch and the motley of Shmendrick and what did I really know of my trade?\\" he describes himself as thinking in 1883. \\"If someday I return to Yiddish theater let me at least not be so ignorant.\\"Adler, 1999, 218 Much of the theater performed during this period was later referred to as shund, or trash, though critics such as Itsik Manger felt it possessed a naive energy and was unfairly maligned.Itsik Manger, Jonas Turkow, and Moyshe Perenson, eds., Yidisher teater in Eyrope tsvishn beyde velt-milkhomes, vol. 1, Poyln (New York, 1968); p 13 What seemed, for a time, a boundless future in Russia was cut short by the anti- Jewish reaction following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II; Yiddish theatre was banned, under an order effective September 14, 1883.Adler, 1999, 221, 222, passim This ban caused an exodus of Yiddish actors and playwrights to other countries ‚Äì Poland, in particular ‚Äì where they had the freedom to perform. The Moscow Yiddish Theater, or Jewish Kamerny Theatre in Moscow, or new Yiddish Chamber Theater, directed by Aleksey Granovsky, and with contributors including Marc Chagall, was founded in Petrograd in June 1919 as an experimental workshop then became the Moscow State Jewish Theatre.Benjamin Harshav The Moscow Yiddish Theater: Art on Stage in the Time of Revolution 2008 -030011513X- Page 194 \\"Report on the Restoration of the Murals for the Jewish Kamerny Theatre in Moscow. ...

In this period, the plays of Schiller first entered the repertoire of Yiddish theatre, beginning with The Robbers, the start of a vogue that would last a quarter of a century. Adler records that, like Shakespeare, Schiller was \\"revered\\" by the broad Jewish public, not just by intellectuals, admired for his \\"almost socialist view of society\\", although his plays were often radically adapted for the Yiddish stage, shortening them and dropping Christian, antisemitic, and classical mythological referencesAdler, 1999, 276, 280‚Äì282 There were several smaller Jewish theatre groups in Manchester and Glasgow.Glasgow Jewish Institute Players, University of Glasgow. Accessed online November 9, 2009. Yiddish theatre in Poland Poland was an important center of Yiddish theatrical activity, with more than 400 Yiddish theatrical companies performing in the country during the interwar period. One of the most important companies, the avant-garde Vilna Troupe (Vilner trupe), formed in Vilna, as its name suggests, but moved to Warsaw in 1917. The Vilna Troupe employed some of the most accomplished actors on the Yiddish stage, including Avrom Morevski, who played the Miropolyer tsaddik in the first performance of The Dybbuk, and Joseph Buloff, who was the lead actor of the Vilna Troupe and went on to further accomplishments with Maurice Schwartz‚Äôs Yiddish Art Theater in New York. It was in Warsaw that the Vilna Troupe staged the first performance of The Dybbuk in 1920, a play that made a profound and lasting impression on Yiddish theater and world culture. The Vilna Troupe inspired the creation of more avant-garde and ambitious Yiddish theatrical companies, including the Warsaw Yiddish Art Theater, founded by Zygmunt Turkow and Ida Kaminska in 1924, the Warsaw New Yiddish Theater, founded by Jonas Turkow in 1929, and the Young Theater, founded by Michal Weichert in 1932. In addition to the serious artistic efforts of the art theaters, cabaret flourished in Poland during the interwar period, combining musical performances with standup comedy. The most celebrated practitioners of this kind of performance were Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Shumacher, who began their lifelong Yiddish comedy career at the theater Ararat in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1927. Puppet and marionette theater also attained great artistic significance, often staging satirical shows on contemporary social issues. Yiddish theater in Poland reflected the political preoccupations of its time. They struggled financially, like all Jewish cultural institutions during that period, even while flourishing for a time during a more liberal political atmosphere. Actors and directors, just like others during that period, were highly aware of labor relations, and tried to create egalitarian working relationships. Organizations such as the Yiddish Actors‚Äô Union, based in Warsaw, played a crucial role in providing a forum for theater professionals to discuss these issues and try new solutions, such as collectively run theaters. Theatrical performances themselves also addressed social issues. Michal Weichert‚Äôs Yung- teater was particularly known for political engagement, staging an attention- getting avant-garde performance of the play Boston, by Bernhard Blum, about the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, in 1933. Yiddish theatre in the Americas WPA poster, Boston, 1938 The 1883 Russian ban on Yiddish theatre (lifted in 1904) effectively pushed it to Western Europe and then to America. Over the next few decades, successive waves of Yiddish performers arrived in New York (and, to a lesser extent, in Berlin, London, Vienna, and Paris), some simply as artists seeking an audience, but many as a result of persecutions, pogroms and economic crises in Eastern Europe. Professional Yiddish theatre in London began in 1884, and flourished until the mid-1930s. By 1896, Kalman Juvilier's troupe was the only one that remained in Romania, where Yiddish theatre had started, although Mogulesko sparked a revival there in 1906. There was also some activity in Warsaw and Lvov, which were under Austrian rather than Russian rule. In this era, Yiddish theatre existed almost entirely on stage, rather than in texts. The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1901‚Äì1906 reported, \\"There are probably less than fifty printed Yiddish dramas, and the entire number of written dramas of which there is any record hardly exceeds five hundred. Of these at least nine-tenths are translations or adaptations.\\" Beginning in 1882 and throughout the 1880s and 1890s, amateur theatrical companies presented Yiddish productions in New York City, leading to regular weekend performances at theatres such as the Bowery Garden, the National and the Thalia, with unknowns such as Boris Thomashefsky emerging as stars., pp.1138‚Äì1139 The Thalia Theatre sought to change the material of the Yiddish stage to better reform the material that was being produced. ‚ÄúThe reformers of the Yiddish stage, Jacob Gordin later explained, wanted to ‚Äúutilize the theatre for higher purposes; to derive from it not only amusement, but education.‚ÄùHutchins Hapgood, The Spirit of the Ghetto: Edited by Moses Rischin. (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University, 1967), 114‚Äì15; Edmund J. James et al., The Immigrant Jew in America (New York: B. K. Jacob Gordin himself had numerous times tried to get his plays onto the Windsor stage without luck. ‚ÄúGordin successfully challenged Lateiner and Hurwitz in 1891‚Äì1892 when he entered the Yiddish theatre with an avowed purpose of reforming Yiddish drama.‚ÄùDavid S. Lifson \\"Writers and Plays.\\" The Yiddish Theatre in America. New York: T. Yoseloff, 1965. 77. Rather than ‚Äúpandering to the public's taste for cheap shund (trash) plays, he sought to secure goodwill of the East Side‚Äôs intelligentsia with literature and increasingly incorporated the concepts of ‚Äútrue art‚Äù and ‚Äúserious drama‚Äù into their public image.‚ÄùJudith Thissen, Reconsidering The Decline Of The New York Yiddish Theatre In The Early 1900S (Theatre Survey 44:2, 2003) 177. Professional companies soon developed and flourished, so that between 1890 and 1940, there were over 200 Yiddish theaters or touring Yiddish theatre troupes in the United States. At many times, a dozen Yiddish theatre groups existed in New York City alone, with the Yiddish Theater District, sometimes referred to as the \\"Jewish Rialto\\", centered on Second Avenue in what is now the East Village, but was then considered part of the Jewish Lower East Side, which often rivaled Broadway in scale and quality. At the time the U.S. entered World War I, there were 22 Yiddish theaters and two Yiddish vaudeville houses in New York City alone.Adler, 1999, 370 (commentary) Original plays, musicals, and even translations of Hamlet and Richard Wagner's operas were performed, both in the United States and Eastern Europe during this period. Yiddish theatre is said to have two artistic golden ages, the first in the realistic plays produced in New York City in the late 19th century, and the second in the political and artistic plays written and performed in Russia and New York in the 1920s. Professional Yiddish theatre in New York began in 1886 with a troupe founded by Zigmund Mogulesko. At the time of Goldfaden's funeral in 1908, the New York Times wrote, \\"The dense Jewish population on the lower east side of Manhattan shows in its appreciation of its own humble Yiddish poetry and the drama much the same spirit that controlled the rough audiences of the Elizabethan theatre. There, as in the London of the sixteenth century, is a veritable intellectual renascence.\\" > Jacob Dinezon quipped: \\"The still young Yiddish theatre that went to America > did not recognize its father just three or four years later, nor would it > obey or come when called.\\" Responding in a letter to Dinezon, Goldfaden > wrote: \\"I do not have any complaints about the American Yiddish theatre not > recognizing its father... it is not rare that children do not recognize > their parents; or even that the parents cannot travel the road their > children have gone.

Here in America ... it has thrown all shame aside > and not only is it not learning anything, it has forgotten whatever good it > used to know.‚Äù\\"Jacob Dinezon, Zikhroynes un Bilder, Chapter 11 ‚ÄúIn February 1902, Jewish builder and philanthropist Harry Finschel bought a piece of land of about 10,000 square feet, at the south corner of Grand and Chrystie Streets with the intention to erect on the site a theatre for Yiddish performances.‚ÄùOffice of the City Register, Pre-1917 Conveyances, Section I, liber 70 cp 157. Fischel paid $200,000 for the lots 255‚Äì261 Grand Street and lots known as 78‚Äì81 Forsyth Street. At the time of the opening of the Grand Theatre in New York (1903), New York's first purpose-built Yiddish theater, the New York Times noted: \\"That the Yiddish population is composed of confirmed theatregoers has been evident for a long time, and for many years at least three theatres, which had served their day of usefulness for the English dramas, have been pressed into service, providing amusement for the people of the Ghetto.\\"\\"Actors Own New Theatre: Culmination of Methods Which Have Been Followed in East Side Playhouses for Several Years Reached by Building of Grand Street House\\" (February 8, 1903). New York Times. In fact, this was a tremendous understatement of what was going on in Yiddish theatre at the time. Around the same time, Lincoln Steffens wrote that the theatre being played at the time in Yiddish outshone what was being played in English.Adler, 1999, 361 (commentary) Yiddish New York theatregoers were familiar with the plays of Ibsen, Tolstoy, and even Shaw long before these works played on Broadway, and the high calibre of Yiddish language acting became clear as Yiddish actors began to cross over to Broadway, first with Jacob Adler's tour de force performance as Shylock in a 1903 production of The Merchant of Venice, but also with performers such as Bertha Kalich, who moved back and forth between the city's leading Yiddish-language and English-language stages. > Nina Warnke wrote: \\"In his memoirs, A.

This first golden age of Yiddish drama in America ended when the period from 1905 to 1908 brought half a million new Jewish immigrants to New York. Once again, as in the 1880s, the largest audience for Yiddish theatre was for lighter fare. The Adlers and Keni Liptzin hung on doing classic theatre, but Boris and Bessie Thomashefsky returned to the earlier style, making a fortune off of what the Adlers despised as shund (\\"trash\\") theatre. Plays like Joseph Lateiner's The Jewish Heart succeeded at this time, while Gordin's late plays like Dementia Americana (1909) were initially commercial failures. It would be 1911 before the trend was reversed, with Adler's commercially successful production of Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (also known as Redemption), translated into Yiddish by Kobrin.Adler, 1999, 361‚Äì364, 367 Both the more and the less serious Yiddish theatre persisted. As Lulla Rosenfeld writes, \\"Art and shund alike would find their audience.\\"Adler, 1999, 367 (commentary) In 1926, developer Louis N. Jaffe built this theatre for actor Maurice Schwartz (\\"Mr. Second Avenue\\") and his Yiddish Art Theatre. The area was known as the \\"Jewish Rialto\\" at the time. After four seasons it became the Yiddish Folks Theatre, then a movie theatre, the home of the Phoenix Theatre, the Entermedia Theatre, and now a movie theater again, the Village East Cinema. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1993., p.67 The Yiddish theatre continued to have its ups and downs. In 1918, Isaac Goldberg could look around himself and reasonably write that, \\"...the Yiddish stage, despite the fact that it has produced its greatest dramatists only yesterday\\"... is already, despite its financial successes, next door to extinction.\\"Goldberg, 1918, 685 As it happens, it was on the dawn of a second era of greatness: a 1925 New York Times article asserts that \\"the Yiddish theater has been thoroughly Americanized... it is now a stable American institution and no longer dependent on immigration from Eastern Europe. People who can neither speak nor write Yiddish attend Yiddish stage performances and pay Broadway prices on Second Avenue.\\" This is attributed to the fact that Yiddish theatre is \\"only one of... [the] expressions\\" of a New York Jewish cultural life \\"in full flower\\".Melamed, 1925 Famous plays of this second golden era were The Dybbuk (1919), by S. Ansky, considered a revolutionary play in both Yiddish and mainstream theatre. It has been translated into many languages and performed thousands of times all over the world, on stage and on television; there have been several movies. It is now regarded as the crown jewel of the Jewish theatre. Operas, ballets, symphonic suites and other musical compositions have been based on The Dybbuk.Pe√±alosa, 2012. In earlier years it was considered so significant that parodies about The Dybbuk were written and performed in Europe and the United States.Pe√±alosa, tr. 2012. After the rising popularity of Yiddish theatre in the Americas, shows such as Fiddler on the Roof, created by Joseph Stein and Sheldon Harnick, brought the tenets of Yiddish theatre to the Broadway stage. An-sky wrote a number of other plays, four of which are included in his Gezamelte shriften, long out of print.Pe√±alosa, tr. 2013. One (‚ÄúDay and Night‚Äù) is, like The Dybbuk, a Hasidic Gothic story. The other three plays have revolutionary themes, and were originally written in Russian: ‚ÄúFather and Son.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn a Conspiratorial Apartment,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Grandfather.‚Äù All four have recently been republished in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition. Also notable are The Golem by H. Leivick (1888‚Äì1962), as well as the plays of Sholem Aleichem. Buenos Aires, Argentina figured prominently in Yiddish theatre between the wars. While pre-war Yiddish theatre in Argentina had bordered on burlesque, shortly after World War I Thomashefsky and others brought their companies to Buenos Aires for the off-season when New York theaters were closed for the summer (the Argentine winter). According to Michael Terry, Buenos Aires experienced a \\"golden age\\" of Yiddish theatre in the 1930s and 1940s, becoming \\"the second city of the world history of Yiddish theater.\\"Michael Terry, Yiddish Theater Collection at The New York Public Library , All About Jewish Theatre. Accessed online November 9, 2009. There were also theatre performances in Yiddish in many Brazilian cities. Yiddish theatre after the Second World War was revived with the writing and performance of The Warsaw Ghetto. Many ground-breaking performers were Jewish- American individuals; Ben Furnish in his work Nostalgia in Jewish-American Theatre and film, 1979-2004 notes that Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe were both of Jewish-American descent. Several of America's most influential 20th-century acting teachers, such as Stella Adler (daughter of Jacob and Sara Adler and sister of actor Luther Adler) and Lee Strasberg, had their first tastes of theatre in Yiddish. Though some of the methods developed by them and other members of the Group Theatre were reactions to the often melodramatic and larger-than-life style of Yiddish theatre, this style nonetheless informed their theories and left its stamp on them. Yiddish theatre was also highly influential on what is still known as Jewish humor. Post-Holocaust Yiddish theatre Like the rest of Yiddish-language culture, Yiddish theatre was devastated by the Holocaust. Most of the world's Yiddish-speakers were killed and many theatres were destroyed. Many of the surviving Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazim emigrated to Israel, where many assimilated into the emerging Hebrew-language culture, since Yiddish was discouraged and looked down upon by Zionists. In Soviet Union, the Moscow State Jewish Theatre continued to perform until 1948, when it was shut down. Although its glory days have passed, Yiddish theatre companies still perform in various Jewish communities. The Folksbiene (People's Theatre) company in New York City is still active 90 years after it was founded. New Yiddish Rep, founded in New York City in 2007, has been very successful at producing Yiddish shows for a younger audience than the senior-citizen oriented Folksbiene. The Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre of Montreal, Quebec, Canada has been active since 1958. The Ester Rachel and Ida Kaminska Jewish Theater in Warsaw, Poland and the State Jewish Theater in Bucharest, Romania also continue to perform plays in Yiddish, with simultaneous translations into Polish and Romanian respectively. Although Yiddish theatre never truly caught on in the state of Israel, the Yiddishpiel Theatre company (founded in 1987) is still producing and performing new plays in Tel-Aviv. The longest-running Yiddish production in Israel, which was also one of the few commercial Yiddish theatrical successes post Holocaust, was Pesach Burstein's production of Itzik Manger's Songs of the Megillah (Yiddish: Megille Lider). It also released on Broadway in 1968 to favourable reviews as Megilla of Itzik Manger. The career of the Burstein troupe documented in the 2000 documentary film The Komediant. Opera singer and actor David Serero is bringing Yiddish theatre, adapted in English, back to the Lower East Side of New York, with plays such as the Yiddish King Lear. In 2019, a Yiddish production of Fiddler on the Roof (Fidler Afn Dakh) by Folksbiene opened at Stage 42, one of the largest off-Broadway theaters. It had been a hit in 2018 at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in downtown Manhattan. In popular culture The 1987 musical On Second Avenue is an off-Broadway musical and looks back at Yiddish theatre on New York's Second Avenue. It had a successful revival in 2005, with a cast led by Mike Burstyn, and was nominated for two Drama Desk Awards. The author of Nostalgia in Jewish-American Theatre and Film, 1979-2004 Ben Furnish produces examples of modern playwrights that produce work consistent with the principles and tenets of Yiddish theatre, such as Eleanor Reissa, Miriam Shmuelevitch-Hoffman, and David Pinski. While these are current producers and writers, the themes within the productions remain similar to those of classic Jewish works over the years. One of Alan Menken's first musicals, the c.1974 Dear Worthy Editor, was based on the letters-to-the- editor of Jewish-American newspaper Jewish Daily Forward, featuring the struggles of Eastern-European Jews from the turn of the century as they tried to assimilate while hold onto their culture.

He served as U.S. ambassador to Egypt during the term of President Bill Clinton, and was the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 during the term of President George W Bush. Biography Daniel Charles Kurtzer was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey to Nathan and Sylvia Kurtzer. He received his PhD from Columbia University, and served as the dean of his alma mater, Yeshiva College. Family Daniel Kurtzer is married to Sheila Kurtzer and has three children and eight grandchildren. One of his sons is the American Jewish public intellectual Yehuda Kurtzer. Publications Kurtzer is the co-author of Negotiating Arab-Israeli Peace: American Leadership in the middle east; co author of The Peace Puzzle:America's quest for Arab Israeli peace, 1989‚Äì2011; and editor of Pathways To Peace: America and The Arab Israeli Conflict. He is also a frequent contributor of academic articles and opinion pieces. Diplomatic career Kurtzer joined the United States Department of State and was serving as a junior officer at the American Embassy in Cairo when Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981. He served in Israel between 1982 and 1986, then became Deputy Director of the State Department's Egypt desk in Washington, D.C. He later served on the Policy Planning Staff, as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research. When asked why he was drawn to the Middle East, he later replied: \\"The work never seems to be finished in this region. It is not a place where tuxedos and cocktail parties characterize diplomacy.\\" Kurtzer joined the staff of Secretary of State James Baker. He helped write Baker's noteworthy speech to American Israel Public Affairs Committee in May 1989. The speech was originally drafted by Harvey Sicherman, who used uncontroversial pro-Israel language in his text. Kurtzer's revisions included an attention-getting line that encouraged Israel and its supporters to abandon the Greater Israel idea. According to Aaron David Miller, he and Kurtzer wrote short memos for Baker on issues at hand, rather than longer, strategic papers.Miller 2008, p. 198. Kurtzer was also part of the Clinton administration's team of advisers on the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli peace process. According to Miller, Kurtzer left in 1994 because he \\"felt shut out by\\" the Special Middle East Envoy, Dennis Ross.Miller 2008, p. 244. In 2006, he retired from the State Department and the U.S. Foreign Service with the rank of Career-Minister and assumed a chair in Middle East policy studies at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. He co-chaired, with Scott Lasensky, the Study Group on Arab- Israeli Peacemaking, a project supported by the United States Institute of Peace. They published their recommendations in a 2008 book. In 2007, Kurtzer served as the commissioner of the Israel Baseball League, a league discontinued after a single season. He endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama's successful candidacy for the presidency., Haaretz Kurtzer, James Steinberg, and Dennis Ross were among the principal authors of Barack Obama's address on the Middle East to AIPAC in June 2008, which was viewed as the Democratic nominee's most expansive on international affairs.Jay Solomon, \\"Obama's Mideast Experts Emphasize Talks\\", Wall Street Journal, June 16, 2008; Page A7 See also * Israel‚ÄìUnited States relations References External links *Daniel Charles Kurtzer ath the U.S. State Department * *The Audacity of Chutzpah, Dana Milbank, The Washington Post, March 17, 2008 *Daniel C.

It was a series of circular metal molds into which Gobble-Degoop, a gelatin based gel, was squeezed into. The form was then placed in a small oven and baked into a rubbery soft candy in the shape of worms, insects, and flowers among others, coming in six flavors: licorice, mint, butterscotch, cherry, root beer and cinnamon. Tutti Fruitti, banana and raspberry were offered in refills and accessory kits. In 1968 Kooky Kakes was introduced to bake small cakes and decorate them with arms, legs, and faces using Gobble-Degoop and cake mixes. Other accessories could be purchased on blister cards as well as a few additional mold sets. A Super Incredible Edibles was offered which combines both separate sets into one large set. The \\"Incredible Edibles\\" formula was created by chemist Don Lusk.

The toy consists of a series of die-cast metal moulds resembling various bug-like creatures, into which is poured a liquid chemical substance called \\"Plastigoop\\", which comes in assorted colours. The mould is then heated to about in an open-face electric hot plate oven. The Plastigoop is cured by the heat, and when cooled forms semi-solid, rubbery replicas which can be removed from the mould. The concept of the Thingmaker was introduced in 1963, as part of Mattel's \\"Vac-U-Maker\\" set. This omnibus toy combined the new moulds and Plastigoop technology with the existing \\"Vac-u-form\\" machine, which molded simple sculptures by heating thin sheets of plastic, then using a vacuum pump to form the softened plastic over hard plastic forms. Following this introduction period, the Thingmaker portion was spun off as a separate set, and launched as the \\"Creepy Crawlers\\" line. Mattel packaged moulds from various sets to be sold separately, and also combined moulds into larger omnibus editions, encompassing several themes into one set, under names such as \\"Triple Thingmaker\\", \\"Super Thingmaker\\" and \\"Every Thingmaker\\". Mattel produced many Thingmaker sets as follow-ups to the original \\"Creepy Crawlers\\" throughout the 1960s, utilising a variety of themes, aimed at both boys and girls. There were also several exclusive single mould sets, such as Superman and Tarzan, and original Mattel concepts including Squirtles and Gangly Danglies. Varieties of Thingmaker mould sets * Giant Creepy Crawlers (1965) ‚Äî This set featured nine moulds (as did the original \\"Creepy Crawlers\\"), but these new moulds featured just one giant creature apiece. * Fighting Men (1965) ‚Äî This set of six moulds could be used to create mini soldier figures, using an innovative two-part mould to give the Fighting Men a front and a back. The set also included pieces of wire to place in the figure, making it bendable with the bottom wire protrusions being able to stand on a styrofoam base. Other moulds in the set created weaponry and equipment for the Fighting Men to carry into battle. * Creeple Peeple (1965) ‚Äî This five-mould set formed strange heads, arms and feet. When assembled onto a pencil, they formed weird, Troll-like creatures. * Fun Flowers (1966) ‚Äî Seven moulds full of different styles and shapes of flowers and leaves, for use in decorating and design. * Fright Factory (1966) ‚Äî Five of this set's seven moulds were dedicated to creepy disguises, making pieces such as fake scars, snaggled teeth, or a third eye for one's forehead. Another mould (with a special insert) made a shrunken head, and the last made a dangly skeleton that one built from parts. * Incredible Edibles (1967) - A Thingmaker that made edible pieces. It used a special goop called Gobble De-goop which was placed in molds and cooked like regular Plasti-goop. * Picadoos (1967) ‚Äî A Thingmaker for artists. This one featured moulds with 10x10-space numbered grids. By carefully placing coloured Plastigoop in the grid, one could create decorative artwork in either beads, mosaic tile, or cross-stitch varieties. * Mini- Dragons (1967) ‚Äî The eight moulds in this set formed wings, horns, claws, tails, and other body parts, which could be combined into various fantasy creatures. * Eeeeks! (1968) ‚Äî In the same vein as Mini-Dragons, this set of eight moulds formed several varieties of mix-and-match legs, bodies, heads, wings, antennae, etc., to create large, bizarre insects. * Zoofie-Goofies (1968) ‚Äî Seven moulds form heads, bodies and feet of various animals, from cats and dogs to elephants and lions. * Hot Wheels Factory (1969) Moulds made two piece bodies that fit together with wheels embedded into the bottom mould so you could make your own Hot Wheels cars. * DollyMaker (1969) ‚Äî Five two- sided moulds are used to create two styles of little dolls, and a wardrobe of late '60s fashions and accessories for them. * Super Cartoon Maker (1969) ‚Äî A licensed Thingmaker, the eight moulds in this set form replicas of Charles Schulz's Peanuts characters, such as Snoopy, Charlie Brown and Lucy. *Jillions of Jewels (1970) ‚Äî The last of the classic Mattel Thingmakers. The set had five moulds, but instead of the liquid Plastigoop, these formed solid plastic \\"gemstones\\" and jewelry frames from two kinds of powdered \\"Jewel Dust\\" compounds. It is generally believed that production of the original Mattel Thingmakers was discontinued following consumer safety concerns over allowing children to use a small electric heater as a toy. In 1978 Mattel released an updated (and safer) model of their \\"Creepy Crawlers\\" toy. Called the \\"Thingmaker II\\", this version used a very differently formulated Plastigoop, and used plastic moulds, into which was poured the heated Plastigoop. In this set one heated the Plastigoop and poured it into the green plastic mould(s) to cool; the moulds were not put into the heater, which looked like a small cauldron. The reformulated Plastigoop did not work well and the process of making bugs, etc. with these sets was typically slow, taking an hour or so to make a creation. Needless to say, the late 1970s sets did not work as well as their predecessors, and the attempted revival was a short-lived one. Only two sets were produced - Creepy Crawlers and Flower Fun. ToyMax revival An early version of the ToyMax \\"Magic Maker\\" Creepy Crawlers Oven Set After being out of production for more than a decade, the \\"Creepy Crawlers\\" brand was brought back in 1992 by a New York-based company called ToyMax. With much stricter safety regulations in place, the new version of the Creepy Crawlers set re-introduced the metal moulds and earlier Plastigoop-type formulation, but now used a lightbulb-powered \\"Magic Maker\\" heater, with a heat-triggered door designed to remain closed until the mould had cooled sufficiently to be handled safely. The name \\"Magic Maker\\", as well as the new oven design, were borrowed from an earlier 1980s-era toy that melted clear coloured plastic granules to form sun catcher window decorations. Over the next five years new mould designs were released as well as new mould packs. Apparently Mattel, the originator of Creepy Crawlers, had let its trademarks lapse, for many of the original Mattel concepts were revisited, such as \\"Creeple Peeple\\", \\"Mini- Dragons\\", \\"Eeeks\\" (ToyMax changed the spelling), and \\"DollyMaker\\". Numerous licenses were also employed, resulting in mould designs featuring such characters as Bugs Bunny, The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Batman, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Hamm and the Green Army Men from Toy Story, and The Mask. The new formula Plasti-Goop had an array of colours, and several varieties, including * Glow In the Dark Plasti-Goop * Scented Glamour-Goop * Glitter Glamour-Goop * Stretch Plasti-Goop * Metallic Plasti-Goop * Colour Change Plasti-Goop * Plasti-Steel (Rigid -Goop for use in toy car bodies) * Eraser Plasti-Goop. Toward the end of the ToyMax run, the oven was redesigned to incorporate a fold-down hinged door, and required less at-home assembly. Releases of new mould packs became more and more sporadic over time. In 1997, a wave of moulds (and a new oven set) based on the second Jurassic Park film, and an original line of \\"Mutant Squad\\" Plasti-Goop-based figures (three of the six planned \\"Mutants\\" were never released) heralded the end of another era of \\"Thingmaking\\", and the beginning of a third period of hiatus. In 2001, ToyMax tried again, with both a \\"Creepy Crawlers\\" and a \\"DollyMaker\\" line, but this revival was brief. After ToyMax Since then, a third company, Jakks Pacific, based in California, has taken up the reins of producing Creepy Crawlers toys. Although most of the Jakks Pacific line merely re-used mould designs from the extensive ToyMax oeuvre, they have also produced new character moulds featuring SpongeBob SquarePants and Hello Kitty. New releases of oven sets and mould packs have been sporadic, and seem to come very much at random. Although Christmas 2006 saw release of three \\"new\\" mould designs at the hands of Jakks Pacific, the numbering of these moulds seems to suggest that they are actually unreleased designs from the ToyMax era. In 2007, Jakks Pacific released a Pok√©mon-themed Creepy Crawlers Oven and Mould Paks, and in late 2008, another Oven Set based on the Star Wars: Clone Wars license was released, again just in time for Christmas gift-giving. In the Autumn of 2010, Toys \\"R\\" Us stores released a line of exclusive \\"Creepy Crawlers\\" Activity Toys (produced by Jakks-Pacific) that use injection moulding and hollow, two- sided moulds to create bugs and spiders in solid, wall-crawling and gut-filled \\"squishable\\" varieties. Reviews on the Toys \\"R\\" Us site indicate numerous problems with the moulds leaking in the Creepy Crawlers injector models. As of Spring 2012, the once-exclusive Jakks-Pacific \\"Creepy Crawlers\\" sets and refill accessories are available at other outlets, such as K-Mart and Target. Cancelled 3D printer In 2016, Mattel announced a new version of the ThingMaker, capable of 3D printing toys. The 3D printer version was originally planned for an Autumn 2016 release, but it was pushed to 2017. However, the printer wasn't even released then, and replying to a Twitter comment, Mattel confirmed on November 20, 2017, that plans for the 3D printer version are still being reviewed, and a firm release date has not yet been set, adding that they are working hard to deliver a product that families will love, and once they have more information, they'd report it at their website. Since then, the website went offline. In another Twitter reply, on March 28, 2019, it was revealed that Mattel had discontinued and cancelled the project, and apologized for not delivering any better news for it. In other media =Television show= ToyMax developed their own entertainment property based on the Creepy Crawlers concept, which became a Saturday morning cartoon ‚Äî the series lasted two seasons (23 episodes, including one unaired episode that later saw release on video) and a line of 12 action figures that each came with a metal mould, with which to make unique accessories for the figures. =Film adaptation= In May 2018, it was announced that a film based on Creepy Crawlers is in development. The film rights were acquired by Paramount Pictures. It's scheduled to be produced by Paramount Players and Original Film. The upcoming film's producers include Neal H. Moritz, Marc Gurvitz and Toby Ascher. Stephen Berman, chairman and CEO of JAKKS Pacific, will serve as executive producer.

It was started by John Bishop, a former executive director of SCCA (Sports Car Club of America), and his wife Peggy in 1969 with help from Bill France, Sr. of NASCAR. Beginning in 2014, IMSA is the sanctioning body of the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, the premier series resulting from the merger of Grand-Am Road Racing and the American Le Mans Series presented by Tequila Patr√≥n. IMSA is owned by NASCAR, as a division of the company.https://twitter.com/bobpockrass/status/1185897395009282049?s=21 History =John Bishop and SCCA= John Bishop, a Sikorsky employee, first became involved in motorsport in the 1950s when he met Dave Allen, a Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) staff member. Allen offered Bishop a management position on the SCCA Contest Board, which Bishop quickly accepted. Bishop moved to Westport, Connecticut shortly thereafter. Bishop's duties consisted of defining technical rules and general administration of SCCA competition, as well as providing artwork for many of the club's magazines and event programmes. He became well known in the motorsport scene and enjoyed a good relationship with the organization's president and Kimberly-Clark heir, James H. Kimberly. In 1958, things changed for Bishop as the SCCA experienced internal changes. A new executive director position was created, to which each regional executive reported. This position was taken by Hugo Rush, who later became instrumental in Allen's departure. Although Bishop's relationship with Rush was not good, Bishop gained a vast amount of experience and began to show his qualities as a manager. Rush would later depart due to his disagreement with the club as it moved to promote professional motor sports. Bishop took his place as executive director and was now responsible for both amateur and professional programs. To ensure a more serious level of competition, he was tasked with rewriting the technical rules for the newly formed Pro Racing program. The SCCA had now taken the big step up to professional racing. By 1962, the SCCA was tasked with managing major World Championship for Makes rounds, particularly at Daytona, Sebring, Bridgehampton and Watkins Glen. The club was also involved in the US Grand Prix. Bishop helped to create the USRRC (United States Road Racing Championship) series for Group 7 sports cars to recover races that had been taken by rival United States Automobile Club (USAC). Bishop was also instrumental in founding the SCCA Trans-Am series and the SCCA/CASC Can-Am series. In 1969, the tension and in-fighting caused Bishop to resign. =Beginnings= Original logo, used from 1969 to 2013 Bill France, Sr. was instrumental in the creation of the International Motor Sports Association. France founded NASCAR as a professional oval track series and wanted to do the same for road racing. After discussions with Bishop, IMSA was born and Bishop was given the sole control of the organization (like NASCAR, there was no board of directors). France financed the majority of the organization and owned 75% of the stock; Bishop owned the remaining 25%. The articles of incorporation were filed in Connecticut on June 23, 1969. The first race to be organized by IMSA was a Formula Vee and Formula Ford event at Pocono Raceway in October 1969. The SCCA threatened the circuit management and asked them to block IMSA from racing there. The event was held, although IMSA had to pay an additional $10,000 in rental fees. The race had an attendance of 328 spectators. The organization soldiered on despite the small crowds, and another ten races were planned. Bill France, suffering from financial setbacks, brought on new investors to take over part of his stake in the series. =GT era= (front to rear) Tommy Kendall and Wayne Taylor (both driving an Intrepid RM-1) leads eventual winner Davy Jones (Jaguar XJR-16) and Chip Robinson, followed by Geoff Brabham (both in Nissan NPT-91), Raul Boesel (XJR-16) and James Weaver (Porsche 962) in the Nissan Grand Prix of Ohio, at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, 1991 By the end of the 1970 season, Bishop realized that single-seaters were not capable of attracting large crowds. So he helped to establish the foundations of the FIA (F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile) \\"J appendix\\" for World Championship for Makes sports cars. For the end of the 1970 season, he advertised a new championship for Group 2 and Group 4 cars with equity between competitors. The Grand Touring (GT) season introduced international endurance racing to North America. In , Camel Cigarettes became the new sponsor of the GT series and the sedan series became known as the B.F. Goodrich Radial Challenge. In , the 12 Hours of Sebring joined the IMSA GT Championship's schedule.How Sebring Was Saved From Oblivion in 1973 - International Motor Racing Research Center / IMSA 1969-1989 Later that year, the organization gained recognition from the ACCUS and the FIA. IMSA was scheduled to sanction the 1974 24 Hours of Daytona, but the race was cancelled because of the oil crisis.1975 ‚Äì The First 24 Hours of Daytona Sanctioned by IMSA - International Motor Racing Research Center Bishop did not believe that factory teams would stick with the new series, so he tried to ensure that the rules were not biased in their favor. He was in favor of looking after privateer teams and helping them to become competitive. As European cars began to dominate, a new series was formed in called All American Grand Touring (AAGT) to give equal latitude to foreign cars. Turbocharged cars were permitted in . In the same year, Bishop invited a pair of Jean Rondeau-built Inaltera's to compete as \\"special prototypes\\". They became the foundation of the newly formed Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) category in , with separate rules similar to Group C (Bishop was unhappy with the fuel consumption formula of the latter). In , F√©d√©ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), the organizers of the World Endurance Championship (WEC), attempted to unite the two organizations by scrapping the existing formula and adopting IMSA rules. This did not please Porsche, which was spending vast sums of money on engine development at the time. Porsche responded by boycotting the 24 Hours of Le Mans of that year. FISA responded by abandoning the rule change for the time being. In , FISA president Jean- Marie Balestre almost made a successful attempt to settle the dispute by announcing that turbochargers and fuel restrictions would be phased out by 1989 (excepting naturally aspirated engines below 3.5 liters). This attempt failed, as did another in 1991, in which with chassis ballast penalties for turbocharged cars rendered them uncompetitive, except at Le Mans. IMSA continued to have success with its own Camel GT series. New ownership In 1987, John Bishop had to undergo a heart bypass surgery, forcing him to rethink his priorities. He began to realise that the Camel GT series was in danger of becoming oriented toward the factory-backed teams and less to the privateers as Bishop originally intended. Rules were modified to accommodate the factory teams, which wanted to get into the series, despite Bishop's belief that such changes would be unfavorable to the series in the long run, especially if they failed to meet their objectives. In January 1989, the Bishops sold the company to Mike Cone and Jeff Parker, owners of the IMSA Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. Bishop shortly stepped down as the organisation's president in favor of Mark Raffauf, his deputy president and the organisation's representative on the ACCUS (Automobile Competition Committee for the United States), an FIA recognised sporting body. Cone and Parker in turn sold the organization to businessman Charles Slater by the early 1990s. In 1996 Slater sold the organization with previously accumulated debt to Roberto Muller (ex-CEO of Reebok) and Wall Street based portfolio manager for Bill Gates, Andy Evans, who also was an IndyCar owner and owner/driver of the Scandia World Sports Car team. These changes would lead to the departure of many of the executive board members. Evans was responsible for the name change to Professional Sports Car Racing (PSCR). In 1998 the United States Road Racing Championship was revived as an alternative to Professional Sports Car Racing, involving the Sports Car Club of America and headed by a group of competitors and ex-IMSA personnel, including John Bishop, Bill France Jr., Rob Dyson, Roger Penske, Skip Barber, and Ralph Sanchez. They wanted to keep rules within the United States. When this initially failed, as a result Don Panoz and Barber departed to affiliate themselves with PSCR. =American Le Mans Series era= American Le Mans Series at Road America, 2007 In the spring of 1998, Don Panoz created a partnership with the Automobile Club de L'Ouest (ACO), the organizers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, to begin a 10-hour race in the spirit of Le Mans, dubbed the Petit Le Mans to be held at Panoz's Road Atlanta facility. After the success of the inaugural Petit Le Mans as a part of the 1998 Professional SportsCar Racing Championship season, Panoz announced a new full season championship for 1999, to be known as the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) which adopted the ACO's rulebook under PSCR sanction. The new series replaced the Professional Sports Car Racing championship as PSCR's headline series. Under tremendous pressure from team owners and management, Evans sold Professional Sports Car Racing to Don Panoz in 2001, to solidify the American Le Mans Series. Don Panoz renamed the sanctioning organization back to the International Motor Sports Association and was the official sanctioning body of the ALMS, as well as its support series, the Prototype Lites, the Star Mazda series, GT3 Cup Challenge and the Panoz GT Pro series. After the 1999 USRRC season was cancelled halfway through its schedule due to a lack of competitors, a second attempt at a new sports car sanction body known as the Grand American Road Racing Association was created with full support of NASCAR's France family and other motorsports notables and had its inaugural season in 2000. Grand-Am struggled early on, but proved to be a formidable competitor to the ALMS in later years with a different philosophy based on lower-tech cars, most notably its prototype category Daytona Prototype, giving larger fields and closer competition. Much like the split between Champ Car and the IRL, this split was seen by many as being detrimental to the sport as a whole. Attendance, sponsorships and media coverage dropped dramatically after the split in 1998. =Unification - WeatherTech SportsCar Championship era= In 2012, Don Panoz sold the Braselton, Georgia-based ALMS to Grand-Am Road Racing and helped organize a merger between the ALMS and the Rolex Sports Car Series. In 2013 the unified series was announced as the Tudor United SportsCar Championship. The announcement also confirmed that IMSA will manage and sanction the new series. =Change of leadership= On September 19, 2019, Scott Atherton announced retirement from his position as the President of the International Motor Sports Association at the end of 2019. He had held that role since the merger of IMSA's American Le Mans Series with the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series in 2014. One month following that announcement, then-director of Mazda's motorsports program in North America, John Doonan, was confirmed to be Atherton's replacement. Circuits Sanctioned series =Current series= These are the series that are currently sanctioned and managed by the IMSA organization. IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship Cars dive into turn one during the 2014 Sahlen's Six Hours of The Glen The WeatherTech SportsCar Championship was created in 2014 through the merger of Grand-Am Road Racing and the American Le Mans Series. It debuted under the name Tudor United SportsCar Championship on January 25‚Äì26, 2014 at Daytona International Speedway. For the 2016 season title sponsorship changed from Tudor to WeatherTech.  IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge  The IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge is a grand touring and touring car racing series run by the International Motor Sports Association. The Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge was the support series for GRAND-AM's premier offering, the Rolex Sports Car Series. In 2014 it became the support series for the United SportsCar Championship series upon the merger of the Rolex Series and the American Le Mans Series. The series is now branded as the IMSA Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge, with Continental Tire having been title sponsor since the 2010 season until 2018. In 2019 Michelin replaced Continental Tire as supplier and title sponsor. IMSA Prototype Challenge The Mazda Prototype Lites presented by Cooper Tires Championship is a series featuring two classes of single-seat prototype cars racing simultaneously. Most races are held in support of the United SportsCar Championship; prior to 2014 it was the support series for the American Le Mans Series. The L1 class features √âlan Motorsport Technologies DP02 cars powered by a Mazda MP2 engine, and L2 consists of West Racing WX10 and WR1000 chassis with either a Kawasaki ZX-10R or Suzuki GSX-R1000 engine. Each class has an overall championship, a master's championship for drivers at least 40 years of age, and a team championship. In 2017 the series became the IMSA Prototype Challenge presented by Mazda, featuring LMP3 cars and L1 cars re-branded as MPC (Mazda Prototype Challenge). Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge USA by Yokohama The Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge USA by Yokohama is a one-make series dedicated to the Porsche 911 GT3, similar in concept to the Porsche Carrera Cup, held since 2005. Drivers are allowed to race in two different classes, Platinum and Gold. The entries were allowed in the American Le Mans Series starting in 2009, in the GTC Class. Ultra 94 Porsche Cup Challenge Canada by Yokohama In 2011, IMSA created the Ultra 94 Porsche Cup Challenge Canada by Yokohama, which races in support of major Canadian motorsports events including, the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix, the Honda Indy Toronto, the Grand Prix of Mosport and the Grand Prix de Trois-Rivi√®res. Ferrari Challenge The Ferrari Challenge is a one-make series dedicated currently to the Ferrari 458 Italia, which was previously sanctioned by Grand-Am prior to the merger. Lamborghini Super Trofeo The Lamborghini Super Trofeo is a one-make series dedicated currently to multi-class racing, showcasing both the new Hurac√°n LP 620-2 Super Trofeo and the Gallardo LP 570-4 Super Trofeo that was the exclusive car for the first two seasons of the North America championship in 2013 and 2014. The series debuted in North America under IMSA sanction in 2013. =Defunct series= These are the series that were formerly run by the IMSA organization. IMSA GT Championship American Le Mans Series IMSA IS The International Sedan Series was short-lived and the genesis of the Radial Sedan Series. It is unclear if the 1969 inaugural IMSA Sedan race held at the Talladega Superspeedway Road Course was designated International Sedan Series or not. That being the only race held in 1969 details are sketchy, but over the winter of 1969-70 rules were officially promulgated for this Series. It was initially to be known as the International 100 Series as it was intended for sedans up to 100 c.i or 1600 cc., however was revised prior to the start of the 1970 season to include larger engines and presumably the name change to International Sedan Series. The next year, 1971, the Series was revamped and became the Radial Sedan Series with the revolutionary innovation of requiring DOT radial tires. New rules allowed for cars over 1.6 L divided between two classes. Class A was for Sedans under 2 L., except for overhead cam engines which were limited to 1.6 L. Class B was for larger engines up to whatever IMSA decided appropriate for the Class which was the AMC Gremlin's 232 c.i. for the duration of the 'original' RS Series. As an aside, the \\"Baby Grand\\" moniker frequently applied to these IMSA Series was just that, a nickname. Around this same time a series that was officially designated Baby Grand was sanctioned by NASCAR and consisted of 4-cylinder cars purpose-built to run NASCAR ovals. A few RS regulars are known to have run both Series with the same car making minimal changes to accommodate the difference in rules. Carson Baird, driving a Dodge Colt, was one of these 'crossover' competitors. IMSA RS The IMSA RS Series (abbreviation for Radial Sedan) began as the Baby Grand Series, in 1971. Originally sponsored by B.F. Goodrich (therefore known as Goodrich Radial Challenge) until they dropped sponsorship midway through 1975 (or 1976) and then by Goodyear (becoming the Goodyear Radial Challenge), and later as Champion Spark Plug Challenge. The initial race held was in 1969 at Talladega Superspeedway Road Course. Gaston Andrey was first overall in an Alfa Romeo Giulia Super sedan. The Series' first year was actually 1970 with only two races, the inaugural race was at the newly constructed Summit Point Motorsports Park on Memorial Day weekend; Rasey Feezell was first overall in an Alfa Romeo Giulia TI Super sedan; the second race was held at the Montgomery Speedway, Alabama, Red Farmer won in a specially prepared Datsun 510. Feezell didn't fare too well having to drive against the local four-cylinder \\"beater class\\" cars brought in to fill out the field, with their protruding wheels rubbing Racey's \\"immaculate\\" Alfa Romeo. Infuriated, Feezell quit and never ran another IMSA RS race after that. The idea was to attract racers who did not have the budgets that were required in the GT category as well as an emphasis on compact sedans such as the AMC Gremlin and the Opel Manta. There were two classes from 1970 through 1973: Class A for under two liters and under 1.6 liters with overhead cam and Class B for over 1.6 L with overhead cam and over two liters up to the largest permitted engine being the AMC Gremlin. In 1974 all cars were placed in one class, with the only parity for the smaller engines being free carburetion for under 1.6 liters. Limited preparation was permitted, and since the entrants were meant to be street-driven race cars, the original rules required the retention of headlights, seats, upholstery, window cranks, stock brakes and original springs and radial tires. Only the exhaust systems and shock absorbers were free. Later rules regarding headlights, seats, upholstery, window cranks, original springs, and other stock elements were loosened up somewhat. From the beginning, engine modifications similar to Sports Car Club of America B Sedan were permitted, with the main difference being that over-boring cylinders was not allowed, and stock carburetors being required, but modifications allowed. In addition, springs and alignment were free. The series was loosely based on rival SCCA Trans-Am's Two-Five Challenge rules. The series became dominated mostly by Mazda's rotary-powered RX-2 and RX-3 prompting IMSA to specify heavier weights than piston-engined cars and prohibited any modifications to the rotors and more importantly to intake and exhaust ports. Datsun also had a fair share of success within the series with cars such as the 510 and 200SX. Many drivers would cut their teeth in this series such as Don Devendorf, of Electramotive fame, Jim Downing, of Kudzu, and Bobby Rahal. The final season was run in 1984 before it was replaced by the IMSA Showroom Stock class the following year, while retaining its sponsor until 1988. As with most now-defunct racing classes, there are revival races run for this category and the SCCA sanctions events for mostly-stock and all-stock cars. American Challenge The American Challenge (in full, Kelly American Challenge), otherwise abbreviated as AAC was a category for US-built cars and throughout the series, it was always run as a support race to the premier GT series. Starting in 1977, the series ran until 1989. In 1992, the premier GTO category was renamed to GTS due to sponsor reasons, and rather than leaving the GTO category redundant, the title was reallocated to the former American Challenge cars. As a result, they would be run alongside GTS cars. This series started the careers of Irv Hoerr, Kenny Irwin, Jr., Patty Moise, Clay Young, Lyn St. James and Paul Gentilozzi.http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/nf_imsa_home.html WSPR-Racing.com IMSA Renault Cup The Renault Cup was a one-make racing series that ran between 1982 and 1985. There was an East Coast (1982‚Äì1985) and West Coast series (1983‚Äì1985) as well as an overall championship. The series began with the Renault Le Car for two seasons on the East Coast until its discontinuation in the US. The last two seasons, the East Coast Series ran the Renault Encore. The West Coast Series started after the first successful year on the East Coast, but ran the Renault Alliance which had just been introduced.My Renault Racing History The genesis of the series was an association of drivers, Associated Road Racers (ARR), founded by Steve Coleman of Raleigh, North Carolina. The association's objective was to start an inexpensive but competitive series with large car counts. The main prerequisite requirement was a series that would allow drivers who had regular jobs and a life to compete with at least a chance to win the championship without having to travel coast to coast, as was the case with other similar series such as the VW Bilstein Cup. The preference was to have a roughly ten- race schedule, with each driver's best six finishes counting toward the Championship. ARR's members were mostly Showroom Stock racers from the Southeast and Northeast Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) regions. All members put up a bond to ensure they would participate if it came to fruition so that a sanctioning body and a sponsor would be assured success from the start. In the beginning an outline of series rules was drawn up to attract like-minded drivers to join in the effort. Once the association was formed, a final version was to be drafted with all the members' input. The rules along with the association's proposed plan to organize and launch the series, were sent to several manufacturers soliciting sponsorship, including Mazda, Toyota, Nissan, and Renault. All except Renault either rejected the proposal or did not respond. Renault not only responded, it jumped at the chance, since it was quite familiar with the concept of a one-make series. ARR and Renault negotiated to finalize a format competing with the Le Car R5. Due to classic concerns of track owners and sanctioning bodies, Renault was reluctant to agree to the drivers' points system. Their counterproposal was to run an East Coast series in lieu of nationwide. Since most of the interested drivers were from the East Coast, and the amount of travel required was somewhat limited, this was accepted by the drivers. Once Renault was on board, John Bishop, President of IMSA, was approached to sanction the series. He was very skeptical at first. A meeting was held on at Road Atlanta between Bishop, B Clar, the US Competition Director of Renault, and Coleman representing the drivers. Renault offered a major support program and ARR would guarantee a minimum of twenty-five entrants for the first race. Bishop, still skeptical, agreed to sanction the series. Coleman even suggested there might be as many as fifty, if Renault and IMSA didn't revise the proposed series rules to a point the majority of drivers would pull out before then. Still skeptical he agreed, convinced by Renault's commitment and the driver's assurances of a full field for the inaugural race. Exactly one year to the date on April 4, 1982, the inaugural race was held at Road Atlanta. 51 Le Cars started the race. One notable driver to come from the series was Parker Johnstone; he took runner-up spot on his debut season in 1984 and would virtually dominate the series following that. IMSA Showroom Stock In 1985, IMSA would undergo a major rules reformat while still retaining its sponsor, therefore it was still known by its sponsor's moniker. This time, the series was more restricted to current models, that is to say models then currently available for retail sale in dealerships throughout the US. Other than that, the series had rules and race formats that were similar to the RS series, being an endurance series. At the end of the 1987 season, Champion stepped down as sponsor and was replaced by Firestone Tire and Rubber Company; therefore, the series was renamed IMSA Firestone Firehawk Endurance Championship, commonly known as the Firehawk Series, after the Firehawk performance tire brand. Total prize purses, year-end point funds and manufacturer contingency awards in 1991 amounted up to $1 million. As required by the sponsor, all cars were required to use its own Firehawk SZ or Firehawk SV tires which could be shaved to racing depth, or the all-season Firehawk GTX. Bosch and Kendall Oil were also associate sponsors. Most of the drivers that competed in the series were amateurs or semi-professional, whilst a few made their living out of competing in the series. Dorsey Schroeder and John Andretti are among the few full-time professional drivers who cut their teeth in the series. Meetings usually attracted over ninety entries and were often televised, the duration of the races varying from one two hour and a half event to one 24 hour race. The series would soldier on until 1998, by then known as Speedvision Cup, named for the former motosports-ortiented television network. During the sportscar racing \\"split\\" from 1998 until 2013, a rival series from Canada, the Motorola Cup, was sanctioned by the SCCA, with Grand-Am taking over in 2001. This is the other series that led to the modern Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge. There are three classes, sorted in order from the highest *Grand Sport Class **Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Trans Am, Nissan 300ZX (twin-turbo), BMW M3, Ford Thunderbird, Ford Mustang, Porsche 944, Mazda RX-7 (FC3S) *Sport Class **Pontiac Sunbird Turbo, Volkswagen Corrado *Touring Class, **Honda Civic Si, Audi 100 Quattro, Pontiac Grand Am IMSA Bridgestone Supercar Championship IMSA also hosted the Bridgestone Supercar Championship, sponsored by the sister brand of Firestone, Bridgestone, which was for higher- end sports cars such as the Porsche 911 Turbo, Lotus Esprit X180R, Chevrolet Corvette, Mazda RX-7 and Nissan 300ZX and was run between 1991 up until 1995. Usually a telivised support race to the GT races, running at 30 minutes, the series attracted some well-known professional drivers such as Hans-Joachim Stuck, Hurley Haywood, Doc Bundy, Elliot Forbes-Robinson, Andy Pilgrim and Paul Newman. with a total prize fund of $555,555 for the 1992 season. All cars had to run on road-going Bridgestone Potenza RE71 tires which were trimmed to semi-racing depth and during a wet race, cars raced on full depth. The series was not without controversy, mainly for the all-composite Consulier GTP, as it was bordering on a departure from the showroom stock ethos, as well as being criticised for having little common with cars that the general public ever saw on a public road. The GTP debuted with just four silver Consulier Series II GTP at Lime Rock in 1991, despite having a 2.2 liter turbo with about connected to a five-speed gearbox, weighing at . The car took a pole-to- chequered flag finish, easily outpacing the other more powerful but heavier cars, even if they were piloted by talented and more experienced drivers such as Hurley Haywood in a factory Porsche, Boris Said's Callaway Twin Turbo Corvette, and Jim Minnaker in a factory ZR1 Corvette. It was subsequently announced by IMSA that they felt that it was not in the best interests of the series to allow the Consulier to continue with such a massive weight advantage, so as a result they added a weight penalty to the GTP,before its being barred from the series altogether at the end of the season, despite taking a runner up spot. Formula BMW USA The Formula BMW USA series is the North American version of the open-wheel series supported by BMW. All running identical chassis powered by BMW motorcycle engines, the series serves as stepping stone for formula car drivers moving into higher international series. A world championship of all Formula BMW series is run at the end of the year, taking the top drivers from Formula BMW USA and the other similar series elsewhere in the world. Atlantic Championship In June 2008, IMSA began sanction of the Atlantic Championship for two seasons. The series later came under SCCA Pro Racing sanction in 2012. Panoz Racing Series Originally began as Women's Global GT Series, formed by Lyn St. James in 1999, the series began as a support race to ALMS for women racers, using the race modified version of the Panoz Esperante series of cars. The series was an invitational affair with forty one drivers are selected out of four hundred applicants to participate in the Women's Global GT Series. The grid would usually consists of experienced racers such as former Formula One drivers, Giovanna Amati and Divina Galica, NASCAR's Shawna Robinson, and Italian Audi factory team touring car driver Tamara Vidali against talented amateur drivers from varying degrees of professions, such as radio personality, police officer, law student, and racing simulations art designer for Microsoft.

It was produced fortnightly from 1999 to 2001, and sporadically until 2003, by Charlie Brooker. The site now exists only in archive form. TVGoHome columns also appeared for a short time in Loaded magazine, sometimes edited from their original web version. The website gained a cult following, partly due to its tie-up with the technology newsletter Need To Know, and its use of strong language, surreal imagery and savage satire reminiscent of the work of Chris Morris. Indeed, Morris himself contributed on occasion, under the pseudonym 'Sid Peach'. Regular targets for ridicule were the Daily Mail, Mick Hucknall of Simply Red, and the TV presenters Rowland Rivron and Nicky Campbell. TVGoHome's most consistent target, however, was fictional. Nathan Barley, an ex-public-school media wannabe living off his parents' wealth, had his life chronicled in a fly-on-the-wall documentary series (in the TVGoHome universe) entitled simply 'Cunt'. Detailing Barley's comfortable life in the now gentrified area of formerly working class Westbourne Grove in west London, the programme essentially mocked the \\"new media\\" scene and its population of self-obsessed, middle-class web designers, DJs and magazine producers, their obsessions with absurd fashions and gadgetry, their inevitably feeble and derivative attempts at creativity, and their tireless efforts to embody the cutting edge of urban cool. A spinoff book of the same title was later released featuring old and new material. Brooker has cited the increasing absurdity of reality television as one of the main reasons he stopped writing TVGoHome. The ideas for real life shows such as Touch the Truck, in which contestants must continually touch a truck for 24 hours in order to win the truck as a prize, were the kind of idea that at one point would only have existed as an absurd satirical creation of Brooker's website. Now that they were becoming a reality, Brooker felt it was probably time to stop. In 2006, Brooker began a regular column in The Guardian, featuring new TVGoHome listings.  Recurring programmes  * Cunt, a fly-on- the wall series featuring Nathan Barley, a \\"new media\\" type kept housed and up to date with the latest pointless technological gadgets through constant parental financial support. Barley is depicted as being of absolutely no value to society, with no morals and even less intelligence, and having many friends (all of whom are exactly like him). On one occasion he attempts to let his girlfriend down over a 6-month period, ultimately ending in his once confident, happy girlfriend being sectioned. He is subject to almost pathological levels of hatred from the writer of the billing of the show. * Daily Mail Island, a reality TV show where several normal people are deposited on an island and not allowed access to any media other than the strongly right-wing, deeply conservative Daily Mail newspaper, leading to them becoming progressively more irrational and brutal as the series progresses ‚Äî for example, tying teenage lovers together with sacks on their heads and beating them, or sealing a teenager caught masturbating into a coffin filled with broken glass and dog faeces and throwing it over a cliff and their language devolving into rhetorical questions and sarcastic snorts. * Get Hen!, a bizarre interactive programme in which home viewers fire lightguns at a dancing hen inserted into various pieces of film. * Mick Hucknall's Pink Pancakes, in which Mick Hucknall of Simply Red fame presses his testicles against various transparent surfaces, including shop windows, glass coffee tables and Chinese riot shields. Briefly succeeded by Mick Hucknall's Spud Tip Challenge, in which he quite simply balanced a baby new potato on the end of his penis. * Ricky's Luck, a drama featuring Ricky who suffers appallingly bad luck in just about everything he does. The 'Ricky' featured is almost certainly based on/actually meant to be EastEnders character Ricky Butcher, noted for having constantly bad luck throughout his tenure on the soap. The title is also likely a play on Tucker's Luck, a spin-off of the children's series Grange Hill. * Patrick Kielty's Streets of Fundom, where Patrick Kielty performs various completely meaningless actions while roaming the streets of Britain, such as wearing a Viking helmet, climbing onto the back of a man dressed as a cartoon Hitler and then letting off party poppers each time he passes an elderly woman. Television The TVGoHome format itself, or elements derived from it, have featured within several television comedy and entertainment programmes. A TVGoHome comedy sketch show was produced in 2001, consisting of six half-hour episodes broadcast on E4, later compiled into a smaller number of 'highlights' shows for broadcast on Channel 4. It was written by Brooker, among others, and directed by Tristram Shapeero, who also directed the controversial Brass Eye special on paedophilia. The sketches included new material and skits based on previous TVGH entries. A spin-off from TVGH was Unnovations, based on a parody of the Innovations catalogue; this was turned into a TV sketch/sitcom series, broadcast on UK Play in 2001-02; since that channel's demise, it has not been repeated. A sitcom entitled Nathan Barley, based on a character first featured within TVGoHome columns, was co-written by Brooker with Chris Morris, and was broadcast in February 2005. Brooker's 2009 Channel 4 TV-themed panel review show You Have Been Watching features TVGH-style spoof listings pages in its opening title sequence.

Records of his early life are sparse, but he must have gone to Florence as a young man. He began working for Cosimo de' Medici on 1 March 1559 as a musician, eventually to replace Francesco Corteccia as the principal musician to the Medici court. In 1560 he visited Venice, and produced two books of madrigals in response to the musical styles he encountered there.Butchart, 46 In 1567 the Medici sent him on a diplomatic mission to England. Throughout the 1560s Striggio composed numerous intermedi for the Medici, for weddings, visits, and other state occasions. In the 1570s he continued to work for the Medici, but there is some evidence he began to travel away from Florence. He had some connection to the Bavarian court in Munich, and may have gone there on more than one occasion (possibly for the performance of his 40-voice motet Ecce beatam lucem which he wrote for a royal marriage there). He became friends with Vincenzo Galilei, the father of the astronomer, during the 1570s; whether or not he was a member of the Florentine Camerata is uncertain. During the 1580s he began an association with the Este court in Ferrara. Ferrara was one of Italy's avant-garde centers of musical composition in the 1580s and 1590s, and Striggio composed music in the progressive madrigal style he heard there, evidently commissioned by the Medici. This music is unfortunately lost. In 1586 Striggio moved to Mantua where he remained for the rest of his life, although he retained a close association with the Medici, composing music for them at least as late as 1589. Works Striggio wrote both sacred and secular music, and all his surviving music is vocal, although sometimes with instrumental accompaniment. He published seven books of madrigals, in addition to two versions of his most famous composition, the madrigal comedy Il cicalamento delle donne al bucato et la caccia... (\\"The gossip of the women at the laundry\\"). The madrigal comedy, either invented by Striggio or made famous by him, was long considered to be a forerunner of opera, but contemporary musicological scholarship tends to see this as just one of many strands in late 16th-century Italian music which adapt prevailing musical forms to dramatic presentation. In the madrigal comedy, there is no acting: the fifteen individual madrigals in cicalamento tell a story, but entirely in words and music. Entertainments such as the madrigal comedy were not far different from other musical forms one could see at a contemporary intermedio. One of his most impressive works, and one of the most impressive achievements in Renaissance polyphony, is his motet Ecce beatam lucem for forty independent voices, which may have been performed in 1568 in Munich.Iain Fenlon, Grove online There is some evidence that he may have had the music for either this piece or his 40/60 voice mass, Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno, with him on his diplomatic visit to London in 1567, since Thomas Tallis seems to have been inspired and challenged by it, and shortly afterwards wrote his own 40-voice tour-de-force Spem in alium, commissioned by Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Unlike the setting by Tallis, Striggio specifically indicates for the voices to be doubled by instruments. In the Bavarian performance in 1568 of Striggio's motet the forces included eight flutes, eight violas, eight trombones, harpsichord and bass lute. The motet is a polychoral composition for four choirs, which include sixteen, ten, eight and six voices respectively, all spatially separated. A work on a yet larger scale, and long reputed to be lost, is Striggio's mass composed in 40 parts, and which included a 60-voice setting of the final Agnus Dei. The work was recently unearthed by Berkeley musicologist Davitt Moroney and identified as a parody mass, Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno, and received its first modern performance at the Royal Albert Hall during the London Proms on 17 July 2007 by the BBC Singers and The Tallis Scholars conducted by Moroney. This work was most likely composed in 1565/6, and carried by Striggio on a journey across Europe in late winter and spring 1567, for performances at Mantua, Munich and Paris.Moroney, p. 8-16 The first commercial recording of the Mass, by the British group I Fagiolini, was released in March 2011, and won a Gramophone Award, and a Diapason D'Or de L'Ann√©e A second recording followed in 2012 directed by Herv√© Niquet and prepared by Dominique Visse. Striggio was highly influential, as can be seen by the wide distribution of his music in Europe in the late 16th century. His influence was especially large in England; this may have been due in part to his 1567 visit, and also may have been related to the activities of Alfonso Ferrabosco, the Italian madrigalist who was resident in England for most of his life, and helped popularize the Italian style there.

Attempts to read historical significance into the wordsW. S. Baring-Gould and C. Baring-Gould, The Annotated Mother Goose: Nursery Rhymes Old and New (Bramhall House, 1962), p. 156. have led to the speculation that this musical round was written earlier and refers to Queen Mary I of England blinding and executing three Protestant bishops.Espoused by Albert Jack, Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes, Allen Lane (2008). . However, the Oxford Martyrs, Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer, were burned at the stake, not blinded; although if the rhyme was made by crypto-Catholics, the mice's \\"blindness\\" could refer to their Protestantism. However, as can be seen above, the earliest lyrics don't talk about harming the three blind mice, and the first known date of publication is 1609, well after Queen Mary died. The rhyme only entered children's literature in 1842 when it was published in a collection by James Orchard Halliwell. Variations Amateur music composer Thomas Oliphant (1799‚Äì1873)Papers of the Manchester Literary Club by Manchester Literary Club, Published by H.

By Thomas > Oliphant, Published by Calkin and Budd, 1837 Robert Schumann's Kreisleriana #7, which is arguably about a cat (Murr), appears to be based upon \\"Three Blind Mice\\", but in a predominantly minor key. \\"Three Blind Mice\\" is to be found in the fugue which is the centerpiece of #7. Joseph Holbrooke (1878‚Äì1958) composed his Symphonic Variations, opus 37, based on Three Blind Mice. Also, Joseph Haydn used its theme in the Finale (4th Mvt) of his Symphony 83 (La Poule) (1785‚Äì86); one of the 6 Paris Symphonies, and the music also appears in the final movement of English composer Eric Coates' suite The Three Men. \\"Three Blind Mice\\" was also used as a theme song for The Three Stooges and a Curtis Fuller arrangement of the rhyme is featured on the Art Blakey live album of the same name. The song is also the basis for Leroy Anderson's orchestral \\"Fiddle Faddle\\". The theme can also be heard in Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's Symphony No. 9 IV. Allegro con fuoco.Listening to Music Creatively by Edwin Stringham, Published by Prentice-Hall, 1959 The British composer Havergal Brian (1876‚Äì1972) used the tune as the basis of his orchestral work \\"Fantastic Variations on an Old Rhyme\\" (1907‚Äì08). The work was originally intended as the first movement of a satirical \\"Fantastic Symphony\\" (Symphony No.1), a programmatic work, based on the nursery rhyme. The second movement was intended as a scherzo for pizzicato strings, depicting the souls of the departed mice going to heaven and the third movement was a Lament for the dead mice. Both these movements are lost. \\"Festal Dance\\" (1908) formed the finale, depicting the wild dance of triumph of the farmer's wife in which passing references to the tune can be heard. Having been performed separately, the first and last movements became independent works around 1914. The theme of the second movement of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 4 (1926, revised 1928 and 1941) was criticized as resembling Three Blind Mice. The line \\"See how they run\\" appears in The Beatles' \\"Lady Madonna\\" (1968) and Redeye's \\"Games\\" (1970 - 1971). A calypso version of the tune with new lyrics by Monty Norman was recorded by Byron Lee and the Dragonaires for the film Dr. No, and is featured in its soundtrack as part of the track \\"Kingston Calypso\\".Monty Norman - The first man of James Bond music In 1969, a version of the rhyme, with slightly changed lyrics and in D minor rather than in a major key, was recorded by Mike Oldfield as part of the duo The Sallyangie, with his older sister Sally, within the song \\"Chameleon\\" on the duo's only album, Children of the Sun. In the song, Oldfield sings the rhyme (among other lyrics) as a lower counterpoint vocal to his sister, who sings completely different lyrics on a different, slower melody, in a high voice. Also in the same year, Sesame Street adapted the song to \\"B is for Bubble\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzbrV0Bc8Fg =\\"Complete version\\"= Published in 1904 by Frederick Warne & Co., an illustrated children's book by John W. Ivimey entitled The Complete Version of Ye Three Blind Mice, fleshes the mice out into mischievous characters who seek adventure, eventually being taken in by a farmer whose wife chases them from the house and into a bramble bush, which blinds them. Soon after, their tails are removed by \\"the butcher's wife\\" when the complete version incorporates the original verse‚Äîalthough the earliest version from 1609 does not mention tails being cut off. The story ends with them using a tonic to grow new tails and recover their eyesight, learning a trade (making wood chips, according to the accompanying illustration), buying a house and living happily ever after.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 21, 2004. In the episode, Marge finds Nelson and acts as a mother figure towards him due to her children's loss of interest in her. Meanwhile, Lisa gets teased about her big butt, and becomes obsessed with her weight. To date, this is Jon Vitti's last episode as writer and Lauren MacMullan's last episode as director. Plot Lisa gets teased by Sherri and Terri about her big butt, so this embarrasses her. She becomes self-conscious about her weight. Homer only makes matters worse when he tells her about the \\"Simpson butt\\", something that all Simpsons have. Bart brings home a geography test with a grade of 100, eagerly expecting a party that was promised to him if he had got a 100. Despite Homer discovering that the watermark of Bart's test is real and that all the answers are correct, he and Marge speak to Bart's teacher. Mrs. Krabappel confesses that she did not bother to fold up the map during the test, so Bart and everyone else received 100. Marge throws Bart a party, which is attended by Patty and Selma, Grampa, Grandma, Ralph, and even Martin. Milhouse can only attend via speakerphone because he is sick with measles. Bart hates the party and to make matters worse, Lisa runs up to her room crying when Marge offers her one slice of cake. Marge thinks her children no longer appreciate her, so when she finds Nelson catching tadpoles from a water fountain at the zoo, she decides to become a mother figure by spending quality time with him. They bond as Nelson tells Marge about his poor life involving his father abandoning him and never coming back. Marge brings him home so he can do some chores. Nelson's mother finds this out and does not want Marge giving them any charity. Later that night, Mrs. Muntz leaves town, and Nelson, having nowhere else to go, stays with the Simpsons. Marge lets him sleep in Bart's room, forcing Bart to sleep underneath his bed. Late one night, Bart sees Nelson sing about his missing father, and sees Lisa eat an entire Labor Day cake as she was unable to take any more starvation. As Bart walks away, Nelson also sees her doing this and after talking about the situation, he offers to help Lisa get back at Sherri and Terri for teasing her. The next day, Nelson unleashes a skunk, which sprays both of them, while Lisa and her friends point and sing a parody of Jingle Bells. Both twins are scared and flee. When Lisa and Nelson return home, they find Nelson's father, who Bart found working at a freak show in a circus. It turns out that Mr. Muntz had really gone to the Kwik-E-Mart, where he had gotten a severe allergic reaction from eating a peanut bar. Coincidentally, the circus had made a stop in the Kwik-E-Mart parking lot, and the unscrupulous ringmaster noted the allergy and kept him as a forced freak for his traveling show. Nelson's mother finally returns, after going to Hollywood and getting the lead role in Macbeth, playing Lady Macbeth. Before returning to his family, Nelson thanks Marge for making him feel good about himself and appreciates what Bart did but says that this is not enough to stop him from bullying Bart. As the family talk about the morals of the episode, Lisa admits that she still has body image issues. Homer tries to get Lisa to talk about it positively, but Lisa says that it is a \\"very open-ended problem\\" and like other women and girls, she may never entirely be content with her body image. Homer tries to goad Lisa into changing her mind, but she refuses to do so.  Production  The episode was written by Jon Vitti and was directed by Lauren MacMullan. This is their last episode to act as this role.  Reception  In its original broadcast, \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" was viewed by 9.95 million people.

Segundo was laid down on 14 October 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 5 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. John L. Sullivan; and commissioned on 9 May 1944, Lieutenant Commander James D. Fulp, Jr., in command. Segundo completed fitting out and contract trials then moved to New London, Connecticut, on 15 June and began training. The submarine stood out of New London on 26 June for the Panama Canal Zone en route to the Pacific war zone. She departed Balboa on 9 July and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 July. The next several weeks were spent in training exercises and weapons firing. The ship was combat loaded on 19 August and 20 August and, the next day, sailed on her first war patrol.  First and second patrols, August 1944 ‚Äì January 1945  Segundo, together with submarines , and formed a wolf pack. They refueled at Saipan on 3 September and departed the next day for their patrol area in the Philippines near Surigao Strait. No worthwhile targets were found, and Segundo ended her patrol at Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, on 21 October without having fired a shot. The second patrol, from 16 November 1944 to 5 January 1945, was more profitable. Segundo, and sister boats , and were cruising between Luzon Strait and the South China Sea. On the evening of 6 December, a convoy of seven escorted merchant ships was sighted. The three submarines made night attacks which sank all of the merchantmen.  Third patrol, February‚ÄìMarch 1945  Segundo refitted at Guam from the submarine tender and was in the East China Sea with Razorback and on 1 February. Three torpedo attacks were made on unescorted ships near the Korean coast in shallow water. The first attack was on 6 March against a small ship but all torpedoes missed. The next was made four days later against a medium-sized ship. Four torpedoes were fired at but they also missed. The third attack was a night surface action against a cargo ship on 11 March. Two torpedoes of the spread hit. The first blew the stern off and the second hit amidships, sinking cargo ship Shori Maru in two minutes. The submarine ended her patrol at Pearl Harbor on 26 March and remained there for a month before putting to sea again.  Fourth and fifth patrols, May‚ÄìAugust 1945  Segundo was assigned to a lifeguard station until 16 May when she departed for her assigned area in the East China Sea. On 29 May, she sank seven two-masted schooners of approximately 100 tons each with shellfire. Two days later, she sank a large four-masted full-rigged ship of approximately 1,250 tons with two torpedoes. She sank another on 3 June with her deck gun. On 9 June, two patrol ships were also sunk by her deck gun. On the night of 11 June, Fukui Maru was torpedoed and sunk. The submarine then sailed to Midway Atoll for upkeep. Segundo began her fifth and final war patrol on 10 August in the Sea of Okhotsk. Ordered to proceed to Tokyo Bay on 24 August, the ship was proceeding south when she encountered the , which was at the time the largest submarine in the world, by radar on 29 August. The enemy boat was ordered to halt by international signal. This was done; and, after several trips between the two submarines by their respective representatives, the Japanese agreed to accept a prize crew aboard and to proceed to Tokyo with Segundo. The two ships entered Sagami Wan on 31 August and, at 05:00, the American flag was raised aboard I-401.  1945‚Äì1953  Segundo stood out of Tokyo Bay on 3 September 1945 en route to the west coast via Pearl Harbor. She was assigned to SubRon 3 in San Diego and began operations from there. The submarine made a three-month cruise to Australia and China in 1946 and a four-month cruise to China in 1948.In April 1948, while visiting Brisbane, Queensland, a team recruited from her crew played a softball match against a local \\"All Stars\\" team which they lost 10‚Äì3. Baseball in Semper Floreat, 23 April 1948, Page 8c. The outbreak of the Korean War found Segundo in the Far East. She supported United Nations Forces in Korea from July to September 1950 before returning to San Diego in late November. In 1951, Segundo was modernized and converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. She returned to her home port and resumed operations until 15 August 1952 when she again joined the 7th Fleet off Korea. That deployment period ended on 16 February 1953.  1953‚Äì1970  For the next 16 years, Segundo operated out of her home port and along the west coast. From 1953 through 1969, she was deployed to the western Pacific every year except 1961, and 1963. Segundo departed for the Western Pacific Ocean on 27 November 1956 with stops in Pearl Harbor, Yokosuka, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Subic Bay and Manila, Philippines and Buckner Bay, Okinawa. The reason for this emergency departure was because of the Hungarian revolt that was taking place at the time. The Segundo was ordered into port in San Diego and shortly after departed for Peal Harbor, then the north Pacific on a special patrol, submerging on 21 December 1956 and resurfacing on 21 January 1957 before stopping in Yokosuka Japan. In July 1970, a Survey Board found Segundo unfit for further naval service. The submarine was decommissioned 1 August 1970, struck from the Navy list on 8 August 1970, and sunk as a target by either the submarine or the submarine (sources differ).

Plot 5 year-old Shirley Blake (Shirley Temple) and her mother, Mary (Lois Wilson), a maid, live in the home of her employers, the rich and mean-spirited Smythe family, Anita (Dorothy Christy), J. Wellington (Theodore von Eltz), and Joy (Jane Withers). After Christmas morning she hitches a ride to the airport. The aviators bring her aboard an airplane and taxi her around the runways, where she serenades them with her rendition of On the Good Ship Lollipop Mary is killed in a traffic accident. When Loop, one of the pilots and Shirley's Godfather, hears about this he takes Shirley up in an airplane, explains that she is in Heaven, and that her mother is also there. When the Smythes learn of Mary's death they make plans to send Shirley to an orphanage. In order to raise attorney fees, Loop reluctantly accepts a lucrative contract to deliver an item by plane, cross-country to New York during a dangerous storm. Unbeknown to him, little Shirley had left the Smythes' home, found his airplane at the airport, and stowed away inside. When their plane loses control in the storm in the wilderness, they parachute to ground together and are eventually rescued safely. The impasse over custody is resolved when Loop, his former fianc√©e, Adele (Judith Allen), Uncle Ned, and Shirley all decide to live together.

They provided a DC-2, designated \\"A-74\\", aircraft for the exterior shots while a true to scale mock up was provided for the interior scenes. A 12-passenger Curtiss T-32 Condor II transport biplane, designated \\"Condor 151\\", in early American Airlines (and Air Mail) livery also features in prominent scenes. In the famous Good Ship Lollipop scene, members of the University of Southern California football team served as extras.

It is defined by hemolytic anemia (with spur cells and acanthocytes), hyperlipoproteinaemia (excessive blood lipoprotein), jaundice (elevation of unconjugated bilirubin), and abdominal pain. The underlying cause is liver delipidization. This is distinct from alcoholic hepatitis which, however, may present simultaneously or develop later. Diagnosis of Zieve's syndrome should be considered in patients with prolonged alcohol use (especially after an episode of binge drinking) with an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin and without obvious signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Pathogenesis  The proposed mechanism of the characteristic haemolytic anaemia in Zieve's syndrome is due to alteration of the red cell metabolism, namely pyruvate kinase instability leaving them susceptible to circulating hemolysin such as lysolecithin. Changes in membrane lipid compositions such as increased cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) have been reported during the hemolytic phase. Diagnosis The diagnosis is demonstrated by the triad of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, hemolytic anemia, and hyperlipidemia.  Treatment  Definitive treatment for Zieve's syndrome is alcohol cessation. Individuals with markedly elevated triglycerides, particularly with a history of pancreatitis or intracerebral hemorrhage, may require plasmapharesis to avoid complications associated with hypertriglyceridemia.  History  Zieve's syndrome was initially described in 1958. Dr. Leslie Zieve described patients with a combination of alcoholic liver disease, hemolytic anemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

It is also known as the blade cut or London cut. The design of the athletic aesthetic of the drape suit is attributed to the London tailor Frederick Scholte. The new suit cut was softer and more flexible in construction than the suits of the previous generation; extra fabric in the shoulder and armscye, light padding, a slightly nipped waist, and fuller sleeves tapered at the wrist resulted in a cut with folds, or \\"drapes,\\" front and back that created the illusion of the broad-shoulders and tight-waist \\"V\\" figure of the very fit. Historical background Most changes in menswear occur slowly and subtly, until the shift becomes noticeably different. This noticeably different change occurs some time after the transition had begun. In comparison, changes in women's fashions are fast and each alteration noticeable almost immediately as it occurs. English tailoring remained the norm in leading men's fashions with a heavy influence of sportswear. 1920s-1930s Introduced in the late 1920s, the athletic silhouette in suits ‚Äúgradually and subtly refined into the drape cut‚Äù. The athletic cut was more comfortable and less fitted to allow for movement. Previously, they were considered informal and not suitable for everyday dress on the streets. During the early 1900s, there was a shift of attitudes, and the clothes that were considered informal or for sports were being worn on the streets and were considered acceptable wear. The English drape suit became popular by the late 1930s. Scholte's distinctive V-shaped suit was developed through ‚Äúdiscreet horizontal drapes narrowed across the shoulder blades from the roomy armholes down to the raised waistline‚Äù. This shape resembled a ‚ÄòV‚Äô, which was caused by the broad shoulders that narrowed to a tucked in waistline, which smoothed over the hips as opposed to flaring back out (like the tail coat or the frock coat that preceded it). The shoulders were not padded, looking natural, broad and masculine. The drape suit was a more comfortable, athletic alternative to the slim suits of the preceding war years and their restrictions. It had more fabric through the shoulders and chest, causing a slight drape or wrinkle. Like other suit jackets, this style could be made single or double-breasted. The pants were also cut fuller ‚Äúwith pleated fronts and wide legs that tapered slightly to the ankle‚Äù. Variations: The American drape suit versus the British drape suit The main difference between American and British version of the drape suit was in the treatment of the sleeve-head at the shoulderline. The American version had a ‚Äúsmooth roll of sleeve fabric where it was stitched into the armscye‚Äù whereas the English version had ‚Äútiny puckers from stitch tucks‚Äù. In addition, the American drape suit has a very tapered waist that helps to exaggerate the bulk in the chest and shoulders, and causes the skirt line to appear flared (Gentleman's Gazette, par. 5). In comparison, the English version has a less tapered waist with a straight skirt line. The drape suit during World War II The drape suit remained popular during World War II, being a familiar and stable piece during uncertain times. A man's shoulders remained broad, fluid and natural; his chest appeared full and muscular ‚Äúwith the deeply rolled lapels‚Äù; ‚Äúhis waist and hips were made trim with the raised coat waistline and ventless skirt‚Äù. By the mid-1930s, ‚Äútwo subtle changes added a touch of modernity to the athletic suit style‚Äù. The first modification was the alteration of the peaked lapel, which became wider and angled more upwards. This added more fullness and width to the ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô chest. The second modification was the alteration of the sleeve armholes to become more narrow and raised. This added more fullness and width for a ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô impact in the broadness of the shoulders and narrow waist. In the 1950s, men's fashions followed the trend of women's. With Christian Dior's New Look for women, came the Bold Look and Continental Cut for men. The Bold Look was the continuation of the English drape cut with greater emphasis on the coordination of the suit with its accessories and shirt. It continued to have broad shoulders with a slightly nipped in waist and a double-breasted suit jacket. This cut was anchored in the WWII version, without the war restrictions. The late 20th century In the 1974 film, The Great Gatsby, the drape suit of the 1920s and 1930s was revisited. The suit was modernized with the use of synthetic fabrics and a more modern construction. Recently, Michael Anton, author of The Suit, has advocated for the return of the drape suit. The American Zoot suit is an extreme exaggeration of excess fabric. Although the drape suit and the sack suit are similar, they are not the same cut and style.

A gingerbread house is a novelty confectionery shaped like a building that is made of cookie dough, cut and baked into appropriate components like walls and roofing. The usual material is crisp ginger biscuit made of gingerbread ‚Äì the ginger nut. Another type of model-making with gingerbread uses a boiled dough that can be moulded like clay to form edible statuettes or other decorations. These houses, covered with a variety of candies and icing, are popular Christmas decorations, often built by children with the help of their parents. History Painting depicting gingerbread sold at the fair. Records of honey cakes can be traced to ancient Rome. Food historians ratify that ginger has been seasoning foodstuffs and drinks since antiquity. It is believed gingerbread was first baked in Europe at the end of the 11th century, when returning crusaders brought back the custom of spicy bread from the Middle East. Ginger was not only tasty, it had properties that helped preserve the bread. According to the French legend, gingerbread was brought to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk, later saint, Gregory of Nicopolis (Gregory Makar). He lived for seven years in Bondaroy, France, near the town of Pithiviers, where he taught gingerbread cooking to priests and other Christians. He died in 999. An early medieval Christian legend elaborates on the Gospel of Matthew's account of the birth of Jesus. According to the legend, attested to in a Greek document from the 8th century, of presumed Irish origin and translated into Latin with the title Collectanea et Flores, in addition to gold, frankincense, and myrrh, given as gifts by three \\"wise men from the east\\" (magi), ginger was the gift of one wise man (magus) who was unable to complete the journey to Bethlehem. As he was lingering in his last days in a city in Syria, the magus gave his chest of ginger roots to the Rabbi who had kindly cared for him in his illness. The Rabbi told him of the prophesies of the great King who was to come to the Jews, one of which was that He would be born in Bethlehem, which, in Hebrew, meant \\"House of Bread\\". The Rabbi was accustomed to having his young students make houses of bread to eat over time to nourish the hope for their Messiah. The Magus suggested adding ground-up ginger to the bread for zest and flavor. Gingerbread, as we know it today, descends from Medieval European culinary traditions. Gingerbread was also shaped into different forms by monks in Franconia, Germany in the 13th century. Lebkuchen bakers are recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm and 1395 in Nuremberg, Germany. Nuremberg was recognized as the \\"Gingerbread Capital of the World\\" when in the 1600s the guild started to employ master bakers and skilled workers to create complicated works of art from gingerbread. Medieval bakers used carved boards to create elaborate designs. During the 13th century, the custom spread across Europe. It was taken to Sweden in the 13th century by German immigrants; there are references from Vadstena Abbey of Swedish nuns baking gingerbread to ease indigestion in 1444. The traditional sweetener is honey, used by the guild in Nuremberg. Spices used are ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom. Gingerbread figurines date back to the 15th century, and figural biscuit-making was practised in the 16th century. The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits is from the court of Elizabeth I of England: she had gingerbread figures made in the likeness of some of her important guests. History of gingerbread shaping Decorated gingerbread hearts with mirrors, hussars, and market souvenirs in Croatia A gingerbread print horse The gingerbread bakers were gathered into professional baker guilds. In many European countries gingerbread bakers were a distinct component of the bakers' guild. Gingerbread baking developed into an acknowledged profession. In the 17th century only professional gingerbread bakers were permitted to bake gingerbread except at Christmas and Easter, when anyone was allowed to bake it. In Europe gingerbreads were sold in special shops and at seasonal markets that sold sweets and gingerbread shaped as hearts, stars, soldiers, babies, riders, trumpets, swords, pistols and animals. Gingerbread was especially sold outside churches on Sundays. Religious gingerbread reliefs were purchased for the particular religious events, such as Christmas and Easter. The decorated gingerbreads were given as presents to adults and children, or given as a love token, and bought particularly for weddings, where gingerbreads were distributed to the wedding guests. A gingerbread relief of the patron saint was frequently given as a gift on a person's name day, the day of the saint associated with his or her given name. It was the custom to bake biscuits and paint them as window decorations. The most intricate gingerbreads were also embellished with iced patterns, often using colours, and also gilded with gold leaf. Gingerbread was also worn as a talisman in battle or as protection against evil spirits. Gingerbread was a significant form of popular art in Europe; major centers of gingerbread mould carvings included Lyon, Nuremberg, Pest, Prague, Pardubice, Pulsnitz, Ulm, and Toru≈Ñ. Gingerbread moulds often displayed actual happenings, by portraying new rulers and their consorts, for example. Substantial mould collections are held at the Ethnographic Museum in Toru≈Ñ, Poland and the Bread Museum in Ulm, Germany. During the winter months medieval gingerbread pastries, usually dipped in wine or other alcoholic beverages, were consumed. In America, the German-speaking communities of Pennsylvania and Maryland continued this tradition until the early 20th century. The tradition survived in colonial North America, where the pastries were baked as ginger snap cookies and gained favour as Christmas tree decorations. The tradition of making decorated gingerbread houses started in Germany in the early 1800s. According to certain researchers, the first gingerbread houses were the result of the well-known Grimm's fairy tale \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" in which the two children abandoned in the forest found an edible house made of bread with sugar decorations. After this book was published, German bakers began baking ornamented fairy-tale houses of lebkuchen (gingerbread). These became popular during Christmas, a tradition that came to America with Pennsylvanian German immigrants.\\"Holiday Tradition with Spicy History\\". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 9 December 2001 (p. N-9). According to other food historians, the Grimm brothers were speaking about something that already existed. Modern times Gingerbread shop in Strasbourg. Replica of the White House made of gingerbread and white chocolate Swedish gingerbread house being prepared. Glaze is put on the walls. In modern times the tradition has continued in certain places in Europe. In Germany the Christmas markets still sell decorated gingerbread before Christmas. (Lebkuchenhaus or Pfefferkuchenhaus are the German terms for a gingerbread house.) Making gingerbread houses is still a way of celebrating Christmas in many families. They are built traditionally before Christmas using pieces of baked gingerbread dough assembled with melted sugar. The roof tiles can consist of frosting or candy. The gingerbread house yard is usually decorated with icing to represent snow. A gingerbread house does not have to be an actual house, although it is the most common. It can be anything from a castle to a small cabin, or another kind of building, such as a church, an art museum, or a sports stadium, and other items, such as cars, gingerbread men and gingerbread women, can be made of gingerbread dough. In most cases, royal icing is used as an adhesive to secure the main parts of the house, as it can be made quickly and forms a secure bond when set. In Sweden gingerbread houses are prepared on Saint Lucy's Day. Since 1991, the people of Bergen, Norway, have built a city of gingerbread houses each year before Christmas. Named Pepperkakebyen (Norwegian for \\"the gingerbread village\\"), it is claimed to be the world's largest such city. Every child under the age of 12 can make their own house at no cost with the help of their parents. In 2009, the people of Bergen were shocked when the gingerbread city was destroyed in an act of vandalism. A group of building design, construction, and sales professionals in Washington, D.C., also collaborate on a themed \\"Gingertown\\" every year. In San Francisco, the Fairmont and St. Francis hotels display rival gingerbread houses during the Christmas season. Guinness World records In 2013, a group in Bryan, Texas, USA, broke the Guinness World Record set the previous year for the largest gingerbread house, with a edible-walled house in aid of a hospital trauma centre. The gingerbread house had an estimated calorific value exceeding 35.8 million and ingredients included of brown sugar, of butter, 7,200 eggs and of general purpose flour. The executive sous-chef at the New York Marriott Marquis hotel, Jon Lovitch, broke the record for the largest gingerbread village with 135 residential and 22 commercial buildings, and cable cars and a train also made of gingerbread. It was displayed at the New York Hall of Science. Another contender from Bergen, Norway made a gingerbread town called Pepperkakebyen.

The hurry-up, no-huddle offense (HUNH) refers to avoiding or shortening the huddle to limit or disrupt defensive strategies and flexibility. The two- minute drill is a clock-management strategy that may limit huddles but also emphasizes plays that stop the game clock.Malzahn, Gus. \\"The Hurry-Up, No- Huddle: An Offensive Philosophy\\", p. 11. While the two-minute drill refers to parts of the game with little time remaining on the game clock, the no-huddle may be used in some form at any time. The no-huddle offense was pioneered by the Cincinnati Bengals and reached its most famous and complete usage by the Buffalo Bills, nicknamed the \\"K-Gun\\", during the 1990s under head coach Marv Levy and offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda. No-huddle The no-huddle offense is usually employed as part of a hurry-up offense, but it is not necessarily an attempt to snap the ball (begin the play) more quickly. Rather, the lack of huddle allows the offense to threaten to snap the ball quickly, denying the defending team time to substitute players and communicate effectively between coaches and players.Glover, J. \\"No Huddle? More Chances\\" American Football Monthly, Dec 2005 issue. Available online at AFM When operating in the no-huddle, the offense typically lines up in a predetermined formation at scrimmage, possibly with a predetermined play in mind. The quarterback may then call an audible, altering the play call based on a perceived weakness in the defense's response. Some teams use this methodology to react to the defense and will remain at this pre-snap state for a considerable time as the clock runs down, providing a stream of actual and counterfeit play changes. =Development as a standard method= The hurry-up is quite old.http://www.soonersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=31000&ATCLID;=208390369 John Heisman's 1899 Auburn Tigers ran an early version of the hurry-up.John Heisman: Auburn ‚Äòthe first to show what could be done‚Äô with the hurry-up offense: The War Eagle Reader Michigan coach Fielding Yost was known as \\"Hurry up;\\" as he had Bennie Owen call signals for the next play - even while still lying beneath the tackle pile from the previous snap. The first team to employ a version of the no-huddle approach as the normal offensive play strategy was the 1988 Cincinnati Bengals under Sam Wyche with Boomer Esiason as the quarterback. This approach, called the \\"attack offense,\\" involved a number of strategies including shortened huddles and huddling much closer to the line of scrimmage than usual.\\"Wyche likes Bengals' retro no-huddle\\", Associated Press. Available online at sportingnews.com The no-huddle approach was used by many teams before but in specific situations for a limited time. This strategy proved to be very effective in limiting substitutions, creating fatigue in the opposing defense, creating play-calling issues for the defense, and various other advantages. The Bengals' regular employment of this offense was extremely effective.Eskenazi, G. \\"No-Huddle Rule Wasn't An Easy Snap for Esiason\\". New York Times, January 11, 1989. Available online at nytimes.com The employment of this version of the \\"no-huddle\\" propelled the Bengals to their second appearance in the Super Bowl. The Buffalo Bills, defeated in the AFC Championship game by the \\"no-huddle\\" Bengals, soon adopted this approach. Under head coach Marv Levy and offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda, the Bills were the first team to truly adopt the no-huddle offense, and with Jim Kelly quarterbacking the no-huddle \\"K-Gun\\" offense, the Bills became the only team in NFL history to appear in four consecutive Super Bowls, from 1991‚Äì1994. The Bills are considered the only team to ever use the no-huddle offense consistently and completely throughout an entire game for several seasons. This means that the \\"K-Gun\\" offense always used the scheme as their primary offensive philosophy. Quarterback Jim Kelly would call and signal the plays himself on the field throughout the entire game. That is a unique achievement that has never been truly duplicated, therefore, the \\"K-Gun\\" offense earned a reputation as the most famous and complete hurry-up offense in football. The \\"K-Gun\\" offense is commonly thought to be named after quarterback Jim Kelly, but was actually named for Keith McKeller, a , dual-threat tight end. McKeller was an exceptionally fast tight end, and due to coaches and teammates saying \\"he has killer speed,\\" his nickname on the Bills was \\"Killer.\\" That was the source of the \\"K\\" in \\"K-Gun.\\" In recent times Peyton Manning, formerly with the Indianapolis Colts and later the Denver Broncos, is best known for this technique, frequently changing the play at the line of scrimmage depending on the coverage that he sees from the opposing defense. In 2013, Chip Kelly became head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and adapted the hurry-up offense that he used effectively at Oregon to the NFL. During the 2014 season, the Eagles averaged around 22 seconds per play, which is the fastest time of any NFL team since this statistic has been kept.Football Outsiders: 2014 Pace Stats. =Differences between the NFL and college approaches= While several NFL teams have begun using the offense in various ways, many college football programs have used the no-huddle or hurry-up as a way to gain an advantage when lacking talent in comparison to the teams they are playing. One twist on this approach is that often a college team will hurry-up to the line of scrimmage and line up in a set formation. Based on what the defense is showing in terms of alignment, the quarterback has the option of calling the determined play at the line of scrimmage or stepping back and looking towards the sidelines where the head coach or an assistant will relay a better play to attack the coverage the defense is showing. The Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL have also used this technique with a coach on the sideline telling their quarterback, via the radio receiver in his helmet, information on the defensive alignment; the radio is operative up until 15 seconds on the play clock and hence is only suitable for use when a fast hurry-up offense is used. Two-minute drill The two-minute drill is a high-pressure and fast-paced situational strategy where a team will focus on clock management, maximizing the number of plays available for a scoring attempt before a half (or game) expires.Theismann, J, and Tarcy, B \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Football\\", p. 132 (2nd ed). Available online at Google book search The tactics employed during this time involve managing players, substitutions, time-outs, and clock-stopping plays to get as many plays in as possible. In the first half, either team may employ the two-minute drill; however, near the end of the game, only a team tied or losing employs the strategy. Most famously, the two- minute drill references end-of-game drives by a team tied or trailing by one possession. The two-minute drill is named for the point in the game, frequently after the two minute warning, when it is employed. If significantly more time remains, a team's standard strategies are still viable; if significantly less, a team has little option beyond a Hail Mary pass or the hook and lateral. Play calling during the two-minute drill emphasizes high probabilities of significant yardage gains or clock stoppages. To help control the clock, teams tend to pass rather than run and to pass near the sidelines rather than the middle of the field. The former provides for incomplete passes while the latter allows the receiver to run out of bounds, both stopping the clock. When plays that do not stop the clock occur, the offense relies on a combination of hurry-up plays and spiking the football - a play where the quarterback stops the clock by immediately throwing the ball into the ground (sacrificing a down by doing so) - and time-outs to minimize time lost. Additionally, in college football, the offense can temporarily stop the clock by gaining a first down. Finally, as the offense gets closer to scoring, their clock management stance may shift towards running out the clock in an effort to deny the opponent their own opportunity for a two-minute drill.

World War II bombsites After World War II many European cities remained severely damaged from bombing. London and other British cities which had suffered the Blitz were pock-marked with bombsites, vacant lots covered in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Many postwar children in urban areas shared a common memory of playing their games and riding their bicycles across these desolate environments. There were often abandoned bombshelters of the 'Anderson' type nearby. In London, Liverpool, Bristol, etc., across the channel in Berlin and other places these sites were constant reminders of the death and destruction of the war.

Formerly a Dutch Reformed Church parish, it now belongs to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. Current uses The Nieuwe Kerk is no longer used for church services but is used as an exhibition space. It is also used for organ recitals. There is a caf√© in one of the buildings attached to the church that has an entrance to the church (during opening hours). There is a museum store inside the entrance that sells postcards, books, and gifts having to do with the church and its exhibitions. The church is used for Dutch royal investiture ceremonies (as per Article 32 of the Dutch Constitution) most recently that of King Willem-Alexander in 2013, as well as royal weddings, most recently the wedding of Willem-Alexander to M√°xima in 2002.\\"Dutch prince marries his Maxima\\", BBC News, 2 February 2002 The investitures of Queens Wilhelmina, Juliana and Beatrix also took place there. History After the Oude Kerk (\\"Old Church\\") grew too small for the expanding population of the town, the bishop of Utrecht gave permission to build a second parish church, the Nieuwe Kerk (\\"New Church\\"). Construction on began in 1380 and finished in 1408. This new church was consecrated in 1409https://www.nieuwekerk.nl/en/de-nieuwe-kerk/history/ to St. Mary and St. Catharine, and the first services were held in 1410.https://www.nieuwekerk.nl/en/chronology/ The church was damaged by the city fires of 1421 and 1452 and burned down almost entirely in 1645, after which it was rebuilt in Gothic style. In 1578 the building became a Dutch Reformed church. It underwent major renovation in 1892‚Äì1914, which added many neo-Gothic details, and was again renovated in 1959‚Äì80. The second renovation proved expensive for the Dutch Reformed Church, forcing the church to be closed most of the time in order to save money on maintenance. To keep the church open, ownership was transferred in 1979 to a newly formed cultural foundation called the Nationale Stichting De Nieuwe Kerk.  Notable interments  The Nieuwe Kerk is a burial site for Dutch naval heroes, including Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, Commodore Jan van Galen, and Jan van Speyk. Despite being Roman Catholic, the poet and playwright Joost van den Vondel is buried in the church.

In recent times, the term has been used in a more general sense to refer to any fight involving large numbers of people who are not organized into factions. Within combat sports and professional wrestling, the term has a specific meaning, depending on the sports being discussed. Outside of sports, the term battle royale has taken on a new meaning in the 21st century, redefined by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale. This new meaning of \\"battle royale\\" refers to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment inspired by the film, where a select group of people are instructed to kill one another until there is a triumphant survivor. Sports =Historical uses= Bare Knuckles, an oil painting by George A. Hayes The label of \\"battle royal\\" has been applied to several events. In the 1700s in the United Kingdom, some bare-knuckle boxing conducted according to Jack Broughton's rules included matches between 8 people. Referred to as \\"Broughton's Battle Royals\\", these events were notable enough to be referenced and spoofed in political cartoons of the era.Wrestling With The Past: The Bizarre Origins of the Battle Royal - Part One While the practice eventually fell out of favor in the United Kingdom, it continued to be practiced in the American colonies of England. Lower-class whites who lived in the backwoods practiced the \\"free-for-all\\" as well as \\"rough-and-tumble\\". This practice also spread to American slaves, who would hold mass fights as a form of sporting entertainment. (Frederick Douglass wrote that such sporting distractions, as well as alcohol, were \\"among the most effective in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection.\\") While a few masters sanctioned slave boxers (as shown in the 2012 film Django Unchained), this practice appears to have been rare in general, as slaveholders did not wish to damage their \\"property\\"; the majority of these events were run by the slaves themselves for their own amusement. After the Civil War, the battle royal entered a popular phase, but one also considered shameful and disreputable in retrospect. In it, promoters for boxing events would arrange for brutal free-for-alls with few rules that were generally between all black boxers. The audience for these spectacles were almost always white people, unlike the pre-War entertainment done within the enslaved community. A battle royal was a frequent \\"opener\\" event for boxing and wrestling shows during the 1870-1910 period. They originated and were most popular in the American South but eventually spread to the North as well. However, the events fell out of favor, especially in the North; in New York, the State Athletic Commission banned the battle royal in 1911. They continued in the South from 1910s - 1950s, but with less popularity. The 1952 novel Invisible Man is a well-known cultural depiction of the brutality of such events, and helped change attitudes sufficiently such that by the 1960s, battle royals had been banned even in the American South.Wrestling With The Past: The Bizarre Origins of the Battle Royal - Part Two Despite all of this, the battle royal was a way for a would-be boxer to get noticed; successful battle royal champions gained enough prestige to be able to work their way up to proper normal boxing matches. Jack Johnson is mentioned in relation to this in Ken Burn‚Äôs documentary about him. Joe Gans and Beau Jack are two famous examples of successful boxers who started in battle royals. =Professional wrestling= WWE wrestlers competing in a battle royal in 2009. In professional wrestling, the battle royal is a match involving anywhere between four and 60 wrestlers that takes place entirely inside the ring ‚Äî a wrestler is eliminated when a wrestler scores a pinfall or knocks out his or her opponent(s) (but rarely submissions). Some promotions allow over the top rope eliminations or enforce them exclusively, notably normal battle royals in the WWE and also in their annual Royal Rumble. Battle royals are often used to determine the top contender for a championship or filling vacant championships. World Championship Wrestling was known for having the largest battle royal in wrestling, held annually at their WCW World War 3 pay-per-view events. The three-ring, sixty-wrestler events consisted of all sixty wrestlers parading out to the ring (usually without formal introductions to save time) and beginning to fight at the bell. Once the number of wrestlers in each ring had dwindled down to a number suitable for a single ring, the wrestlers would all move to the designated \\"Ring #1\\" out of the three and would fight to a winner. The winners of the four World War 3 battles royal were Randy Savage, The Giant, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash. World Championship Wrestling also held an event called Battlebowl in which 20 men started in one ring and would have to throw others into a second ring. From that ring you would be thrown to the floor for elimination. The last man in ring one would rest until one man was left in ring two. Those two men would then battle until one man was left and would be declared the winner. In 1991 Sting won the match after it coming down to him and Lex Luger. Every year thereafter Battle Bowl took place with only one ring and a normal battle royal. Numerous variations of the battle royal also exist, including: * World Wrestling Entertainment's Royal Rumble: an over-the-top rope elimination match which starts with two competitors and adds a new competitor every two minutes, usually up to a total of thirty entrants, with the final remaining competitor being the winner * Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's Gauntlet for the Gold: an over-the-top rope elimination match in which the final two competitors face off in a one-fall singles match * Tag Team Battle Royal: a standard battle royal in which teams of two, three, or four combatants compete for group victory. Variations have been used in both WCW and TNA. Battle royale genre In the 21st century, the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, itself based on the 1999 novel of the same name, redefined the term \\"battle royale\\" in popular culture. The term \\"battle royale\\" has been used to refer to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment inspired by the film, where a select group of people are instructed to kill one another until there is a triumphant survivor. The \\"battle royale\\" phenomenon has become especially popular in the 2010s. Battle Royale set out the basic rules of the genre, including players being forced to kill each other until there is a single survivor and the need to scavenge for weapons and items. The \\"battle royale\\" concept had first gained mainstream popularity in Japan, where Battle Royale had inspired a wave of manga, anime and visual novel works during the 2000s, before the concept gained global mainstream popularity in the 2010s. Battle Royal Gaming style first appeared in the 1997 Nintendo franchised game James Bond Goldeneye 007 in which a maximum of 4 players on split screen, battled it out until one remained. Battle Royal style can also be seen in another Nintendo game Mario Karts in which again a max of 4 players on splitscreen battle it out on a specific open map, until one player or team survive. There are a number of popular battle royale video games, films, manga, anime, and visual novels. Along with the Battle Royale franchise itself, other examples of battle royale films include The Hunger Games franchise (2008 debut), The Purge series (2013 debut), Assassination Nation (2018), and Ready or Not (2019). Popular examples of battle royale games include PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (2017), Fortnite Battle Royale (2017), Knives Out (2017), Rules of Survival (2017), Garena Free Fire (2017), Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018) , Apex Legends (2019), \\"Call of Duty: Warzone\\" (2020), and \\"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout\\" (2020). Along with the Battle Royale manga (2000 debut), other examples of battle royale manga and anime include Gantz (2000 debut), Basilisk (2003 debut), Bokurano (2003 debut), the Fate/stay night franchise (2004 debut), Future Diary (2006 debut), Deadman Wonderland (2007 debut), Btooom! (2009 debut), the Danganronpa franchise (2010 debut), Magical Girl Raising Project (2012 debut), Darwin's Game (2012 debut), and the Death Parade series (2013 debut).

From this line, the Florida Midland Railroad has trackage rights on CSX's Auburndale Subdivision north to West Lake Wales siding, where interchange for the line takes place.CSX Jacksonville Division Timetable =History= The first four miles of the line were built by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1916, and originally extended from Bartow and continued west to Alcoma. The 14 mile segment of the line from Lake Wales south to Frostproof was built earlier in 1912 by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. It is a discontinuous segment of track that was once the Atlantic Coast Line's Haines City Branch, which historically extended as far south as Everglades City. The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967 into the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which led to consolidation of the two networks and the abandonment of redundant trackage in the 1970s, reducing the line to its current length. Seaboard Coast Line became CSX in 1980, six years before Florida Midland Railroad began operating over the line. Winter Haven Line The Florida Midland Railroad also operates a separate 6-mile line in Winter Haven. It branches off CSX's Auburndale Subdivision just south of Winter Haven Amtrak station (about 10 miles north of where the West Lake Wales to Frostproof Line branches off the same line). From Winter Haven, it runs southwest to Gordonville (just northeast of Bartow) where it ends. The line notably serves a 24-acre transload facility in Eagle Lake. It also serves Bartow Municipal Airport. The Florida Midland Railroad has trackage rights from this line on the Auburndale Subdivision north to Winter Haven siding, where interchange for the line takes place. =History= The Winter Haven line was originally built in 1884 by the South Florida Railroad (later part of the Plant System and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad). It historically extended from the South Florida Railroad mainline (the current CSX A Line) in Lake Alfred and extended into Bartow. It was abandoned north of Winter Haven to Lake Alfred in the early 1970s and was connected to the current Auburndale Subdivision (a former Seaboard track). The line was severed from Bartow in the 1980s and it now terminates near Gordonville. Former Leesburg Line The Florida Midland Railroad once operated a third line from Wildwood to Leesburg.

TƒÅrƒÅ may more properly be understood as different aspects of the same quality, as bodhisattvas are often considered personifications of Buddhist methods. There is also recognition in some schools of Buddhism of twenty-one TƒÅrƒÅs. A practice text entitled Praises to the Twenty-One Taras, is the most important text on Tara in Tibetan Buddhism. Another key text is the Tantra Which is the Source for All the Functions of Tara, Mother of All the Tathagatas.Beyer, Stephan; The Cult of Tara Magic and Ritual, page 13. The main TƒÅrƒÅ mantra is the same for Buddhists and Hindus alike: . It is pronounced by Tibetans and Buddhists who follow the Tibetan traditions as .

Within Tibetan Buddhism TƒÅrƒÅ is regarded as a bodhisattva of compassion and action. She is the female aspect of Avalokite≈õvara and in some origin stories she comes from his tears: \\"Then at last Avalokiteshvara arrived at the summit of Marpori, the 'Red Hill', in Lhasa. Gazing out, he perceived that the lake on Otang, the 'Plain of Milk', resembled the Hell of Ceaseless Torment. Myriad beings were undergoing the agonies of boiling, burning, hunger, thirst, yet they never perished, sending forth hideous cries of anguish all the while. When Avalokiteshvara saw this, tears sprang to his eyes. A teardrop from his right eye fell to the plain and became the reverend Bhrikuti, who declared: \\"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavour!\\" Bhrikuti was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's right eye, and was reborn in a later life as the Nepalese princess Tritsun. A teardrop from his left eye fell upon the plain and became the reverend Tara. She also declared, \\"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavor!\\" TƒÅrƒÅ was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's left eye.\\" TƒÅrƒÅ manifests in many different forms. In Tibet, these forms included Green TƒÅrƒÅ's manifestation as the Nepalese Princess (Bhrikuti),((Min Bahadur Shakya title=The Life and Contribution of the Nepalese Princess Bhrikuti Devi to Tibetan History year=2009 publisher=Pilgrims Publishing}) and White TƒÅrƒÅ's manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo (Princess Wencheng). TƒÅrƒÅ is also known as a saviouress, as a heavenly deity who hears the cries of beings experiencing misery in sa·πÉsƒÅra. Whether the TƒÅrƒÅ figure originated as a Buddhist or Hindu goddess is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars. Mallar Ghosh believes her to have originated as a form of the goddess Durga in the Hindu Puranas. Today, she is worshiped both in Buddhism and in Shaktism (Hinduism) as one of the ten Mahavidyas. It may be true that goddesses entered Buddhism from Shaktism (i.e. the worship of local or folk goddesses prior to the more institutionalized Hinduism which had developed by the early medieval period (i.e. Middle kingdoms of India). According to Beyer, it would seem that the feminine principle makes its first appearance in Buddhism as the goddess who personified prajnaparamita. Ranjana and Tibetan alphabets. TƒÅrƒÅ came to be seen as an expression of the compassion of perfected wisdom only later, with her earliest textual reference being the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´-m≈´la-kalpa (c. 5th‚Äì8th centuries CE). The earliest, solidly identifiable image of TƒÅrƒÅ is most likely that which is still found today at cave 6 within the rock-cut Buddhist monastic complex of the Ellora Caves in Maharashtra (c. 7th century CE), with her worship being well established by the onset of the Pala Empire in Eastern India (8th century CE). TƒÅrƒÅ became a very popular Vajrayana deity with the rise of Tantra in 8th-century Pala and, with the movement of Indian Buddhism into Tibet through Padmasambhava, the worship and practices of TƒÅrƒÅ became incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as well. She eventually came to be considered the \\"Mother of all Buddhas,\\" which usually refers to the enlightened wisdom of the Buddhas, while simultaneously echoing the ancient concept of the Mother Goddess in India. Independent of whether she is classified as a deity, a Buddha, or a bodhisattva, TƒÅrƒÅ remains very popular in Tibet (and Tibetan communities in exile in Northern India), Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim and is worshiped in a majority of Buddhist communities throughout the world (see also Guanyin, the female aspect of Avalokitesvara in Chinese Buddhism). Today, Green Tara and White Tara are probably the most popular representations of Tara. Green Tara (Khadiravani) is usually associated with protection from fear and the following eight obscurations: lions (= pride), wild elephants (= delusion/ignorance), fires (= hatred and anger), snakes (= jealousy), bandits and thieves (= wrong views, including fanatical views), bondage (= avarice and miserliness), floods (= desire and attachment), and evil spirits and demons (= deluded doubts). As one of the three deities of long life, White Tara (Saraswati) is associated with longevity. White Tara counteracts illness and thereby helps to bring about a long life. She embodies the motivation that is compassion and is said to be as white and radiant as the moon.

Mongolia, ca. 17th century. Origin as a Buddhist bodhisattva TƒÅrƒÅ has many stories told which explain her origin as a bodhisattva. In this tale there is a young princess who lives in a different world system, millions of years in the past. Her name is Jnanachanrda or Yeshe Dawa, which means \\"Moon of Primordial Awareness\\". For quite a number of aeons she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning bodhicitta - the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further. At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only \\"weak minded worldlings\\" who see gender as a barrier to attaining enlightenment. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until samsara is no more. She then stays in a palace in a state of meditation for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme bodhi as the Goddess TƒÅrƒÅ in many world systems to come. With this story in mind, it is interesting to juxtapose this with a quotation from the 14th Dalai Lama about TƒÅrƒÅ, spoken at a conference on Compassionate Action in Newport Beach, CA in 1989: > There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess > TƒÅrƒÅ. Following her cultivation of bodhicitta, the bodhisattva's motivation, > she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and > she felt that there were too few people who attained Buddhahood as women. So > she vowed, \\"I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all my lifetimes > along the path I vow to be born as a woman, and in my final lifetime when I > attain Buddhahood, then, too, I will be a woman.\\" TƒÅrƒÅ, then, embodies certain ideals which make her attractive to women practitioners, and her emergence as a Bodhisattva can be seen as a part of Mahayana Buddhism's reaching out to women, and becoming more inclusive even in 6th-century CE India. Symbols and associations Painting of Buddhist goddess Green Tara by Prithvi Man Chitrakari done in 1947. TƒÅrƒÅ's name literally means \\"star\\" or \\"planet\\", and therefore she is associated with navigation and travel both literally and metaphorically as spiritual crossing to the 'other side' of the ocean of existence (enlightenment).Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 310 Hence she is known literally as \\"she who saves\\" in Tibetan.Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html In the 108 Names of the Holy Tara, Tara is 'Leader of the caravans ..... who showeth the way to those who have lost it' and she is named as Dhruva, the Sanskrit name for the North Star.Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html According to Miranda Shaw, \\"Motherhood is central to the conception of Tara\\".Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316 Her titles include \\"loving mother\\", \\"supreme mother\\", \\"mother of the world\\", \\"universal mother\\" and \\"mother of all Buddhas\\".Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316-317 She is most often shown with the blue lotus or night lotus (utpala), which releases its fragrance with the appearance of the moon and therefore TƒÅrƒÅ is also associated with the moon and night.Beer, Robert; The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols, page 170Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html TƒÅrƒÅ is also a forest goddess, particularly in her form as Khadiravani, \\"dweller in the Khadira forest\\" and is generally associated with plant life, flowers, acacia (khadira) trees and the wind. Because of her association with nature and plants, TƒÅrƒÅ is also known as a healing goddess (especially as White TƒÅrƒÅ) and as a goddess of nurturing quality and fertility.Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 324 Her pure land in Mount Potala is described as \\"Covered with manifold trees and creepers, resounding with the sound of many birds, And with murmur of waterfalls, thronged with wild beasts of many kinds; Many species of flowers grow everywhere.\\"Edward Conze, Buddhist Texts Through the Ages, p.196. Her association with the wind element (vaayu) also means that she is swift in responding to calls for any aid. TƒÅrƒÅ as a saviouress Green Tara, Nepal, 14th century.

TƒÅrƒÅ also embodies many of the qualities of feminine principle. She is known as the Mother of Mercy and Compassion. She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children. As Green TƒÅrƒÅ she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter within the samsaric world. As White TƒÅrƒÅ she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. As Red TƒÅrƒÅ she teaches discriminating awareness about created phenomena, and how to turn raw desire into compassion and love. As Blue TƒÅrƒÅ (Ekajati) she becomes a protector in the Nyingma lineage, who expresses a ferocious, wrathful, female energy whose invocation destroys all Dharmic obstacles that engender good luck and swift spiritual awakening. Within Tibetan Buddhism, she has 21 major forms in all, each tied to a certain color and energy. And each offers some feminine attribute, of ultimate benefit to the spiritual aspirant who asks for her assistance. Another quality of feminine principle which she shares with the dakinis is playfulness. As John Blofeld expands upon in Bodhisattva of Compassion, TƒÅrƒÅ is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of dharma practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis, Thinley Norbu explores this as \\"Playmind\\". Applied to TƒÅrƒÅ one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development. These qualities of feminine principle then, found an expression in Indian Mahayana Buddhism and the emerging Vajrayana of Tibet, as the many forms of TƒÅrƒÅ, as dakinis, as Prajnaparamita, and as many other local and specialized feminine divinities. As the worship of TƒÅrƒÅ developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose and set down sadhanas, or tantric meditation practices. Two ways of approach to her began to emerge. In one common folk and lay practitioners would simply directly appeal to her to ease some of the travails of worldly life. In the second, she became a Tantric deity whose practice would be used by monks or tantric yogis in order to develop her qualities in themselves, ultimately leading through her to the source of her qualities, which are Enlightenment, Enlightened Compassion, and Enlightened Mind. TƒÅrƒÅ as a Tantric deity 18th-century Eastern Tibetan thanka, with the Green Tara (Samaya Tara Yogini) in the center and the Blue, Red, White and Yellow taras in the corners, Rubin Museum of Art TƒÅrƒÅ as a focus for tantric deity yoga can be traced back to the time period of Padmasambhava. There is a Red TƒÅrƒÅ practice which was given by Padmasambhava to Yeshe Tsogyal. He asked that she hide it as a treasure. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as Sakya Trizin, present head of the Sakyapa sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, who released it to his western students. Martin Willson in In Praise of TƒÅrƒÅ traces many different lineages of TƒÅrƒÅ Tantras, that is TƒÅrƒÅ scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas. For example, a TƒÅrƒÅ sadhana was revealed to Tilopa (988‚Äì1069 CE), the human father of the Karma Kagyu. Atisa, the great translator and founder of the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of TƒÅrƒÅ. He composed a praise to her, and three TƒÅrƒÅ Sadhanas. Martin Willson's work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that TƒÅrƒÅ as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day. The practices themselves usually present TƒÅrƒÅ as a tutelary deity (thug dam, yidam) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one's mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from Buddha Jnana. As John Blofeld puts it in The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: Forms Kurukulla thangka, American Museum of Natural History, Manhattan, New York City Sarasvati thangka, Eastern Tibet, 18th century There are many forms of TƒÅrƒÅ, including various popular lists of 21 different emanations of TƒÅrƒÅ. Green TƒÅrƒÅ, (≈õyƒÅmatƒÅrƒÅ) associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity is the most depicted and the central aspect of TƒÅrƒÅ from which others such as the 21 TƒÅrƒÅs emanate. In her Green form, she is often also known as Khadirava·πái-TƒÅrƒÅ (TƒÅrƒÅ of the acacia forest), who appeared to Nagarjuna in the Khadiravani forest of South India and protects from the eight great fears. She is often accompanied by her two attendants MƒÅrƒ´cƒ´ and Ekaja·π≠ƒÅ. Dharmachari Purna writes on the various forms of Tara: > TƒÅrƒÅ is in fact the name of a whole class of deities. She appears in all the > five colours of the Jinas. There are at least ten green forms, seven white, > five yellow, two blue and one red. As Sarvaj√±amitra says of her form: 'It is > a universal form, varied like crystal, since it changes according to > circumstance'.She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her figure is shown > in virtually all postures from standing to sitting, full lotus, half lotus, > one leg down, and both legs down. There is apparently also a reclining TƒÅrƒÅ. > She has two-armed forms, four arms, eight arms, twelve arms, and Getty even > mentions a Tibetan painting showing a standing TƒÅrƒÅ with 'one thousand heads > and arms'. Ghosh lists seventy-six distinct forms of TƒÅrƒÅ, and tradition > tells us there are one hundred and eight names for her.Purna, Dharmachari; > Tara: Her Origins and Development, > http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html According to Sarvajnamitra she has a ‚Äúuniversal form‚Äù (visva-rupa), that encompasses all living beings and deities, and which changes with the needs of each being.Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 337 Other forms of TƒÅrƒÅ include: *White TƒÅrƒÅ, (SitatƒÅrƒÅ) with two arms seated on a white lotus and with eyes on her hand and feet, as well as a third eye on her forehead (thus she is also known as \\"Seven eyed\\"). She is known for compassion, long life, healing and serenity.Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 333 Also known as The Wish-fulfilling Wheel, or Cintachakra. *Pravƒ´ratƒÅrƒÅ, \\"TƒÅrƒÅ Swift and Heroic\\", a Red colored form with eight arms holding bell and vajra, bow and arrow, wheel, conch, sword and noose. *KurukullƒÅ (Rikchema) of red color and fierce aspect associated with magnetizing all good things *Black TƒÅrƒÅ (Ugra TƒÅrƒÅ), associated with power *Various forms of Yellow or Golden colored TƒÅrƒÅs, sometimes associated with wealth and prosperity including \\"Yellow Cintamani TƒÅrƒÅ\\" (‚ÄúWish-Granting Gem Tara‚Äù) holding a wish granting jewel, eight armed \\"Vajra TƒÅrƒÅ\\" and golden \\"Rajasri TƒÅrƒÅ\\" holding a blue lotus.Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 339 *Blue TƒÅrƒÅ (Ekajati), wrathful with many heads and arms, associated with transmutation of anger *CintƒÅma·πái TƒÅrƒÅ, a form of TƒÅrƒÅ widely practiced at the level of Highest Yoga Tantra in the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism, portrayed as green and often conflated with Green TƒÅrƒÅ *Sarasvati (Yangchenma), known for the arts, knowledge and wisdom *Bh·πõku·π≠ƒ´tƒÅrƒÅ (Tronyer Chendze), \\"TƒÅrƒÅ with a Frown\\", known for protection from spirits *U·π£·πáƒ´·π£avijaya TƒÅrƒÅ, White TƒÅrƒÅ named \\"Victorious U·π£·πáƒ´·π£a\\" with three faces and twelve arms, associated with long life *Golden Prasanna TƒÅrƒÅ - wrathful form, with a necklace of bloody heads and sixteen arms holding an array of weapons and Tantric attributes. *Yeshe Tsogyal (\\"Wisdom Lake Queen\\"), the consort of Padmasambhava who brought Buddhism to Tibet, was known as an emanation of TƒÅrƒÅ *Rigjay Lhamo, ‚ÄúGoddess Who Brings Forth Awareness,‚Äù seated in royal posture surrounded by rainbow light. *Sitatapatra TƒÅrƒÅ, protector against supernatural danger TƒÅrƒÅ's iconography such as the lotus also shows resemblance with the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, and at least one Tibetan liturgy evokes Lakshmi as TƒÅrƒÅ.Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 332 According to Miranda Shaw, there is a later trend of TƒÅrƒÅ theology that began to see all other female divinities as aspects of TƒÅrƒÅ or at least associated with her. Apart from her many emanations named TƒÅrƒÅ of varying colors, other Mahayana female divinities that became part of Tara's theology include Janguli, Parnasabari, Cunda, Kurukulla, Mahamayuri, Usnisavijaya, and Marici. Based on this principle of TƒÅrƒÅ as the central female divinity, Dakinis were also seen as emanations of her.Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 341 Sadhanas of TƒÅrƒÅ Tara statue. Gyantse Kumbum. 1993 Sadhanas in which TƒÅrƒÅ is the yidam (meditational deity) can be extensive or quite brief. Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her mantra is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the TƒÅrƒÅ sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of Vajrayana Buddhism, however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism. Two examples are Zabtik Drolchokhttp://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Zabtik_Drolchok and Chime Pakme Nyingtik.http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chim%C3%A9_Phakm%C3%A9_Nyingtik In this case during the creation phase of TƒÅrƒÅ as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as TƒÅrƒÅ. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the yidam and also the emptiness of one's ordinary self. Green TƒÅrƒÅ, (Syamatara) known as the Buddha of enlightened activity, ca. 11th century. This occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the \\"self\\" is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one's self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of Emptiness and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking TƒÅrƒÅ's energy through its Sanskrit seed syllables and this purifies and activates certain psychic centers of the body (chakras). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization. Therefore, even in a simple TƒÅrƒÅ sadhana a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as Deity Yoga, compiled by the present Dalai Lama, which explores all the ramifications of working with a yidam in Tantric practices. The end results of doing such TƒÅrƒÅ practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of kleshas, and other obstacles and obscurations. The mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels (nadis) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing TƒÅrƒÅ's perfected form one acknowledges one's own perfected form, that is one's intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic phenomena as being inherently real and permanent. The practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one's inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self. As Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, in his Introduction to the Red TƒÅrƒÅ Sadhana, notes of his lineage: \\"TƒÅrƒÅ is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, TƒÅrƒÅ meditation is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion\\". There are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as \\"internal\\" and \\"external\\". Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration. > The preparations are of two types: external and internal. The external > preparations consist of cleaning the meditation room, setting up a shrine > with images of Buddha Shakyamuni and Green Tara, and setting out a beautiful > arrangement of offerings.

The band started out as a post-rock outfit, but later evolved into a live techno act, notably with the release of their third album, Dilate. Its followup, The Great Distraction, was released in 2017. History Several members of Vessels had been playing music together since the early 2000s. They went through a few different lineups and band names before they formed Vessels in 2005. On 5 March 2007, the band released a limited 7\\" single (\\"Yuki\\" / \\"Forever the Optimist\\") through Cuckundoo Records, and were tipped by BBC Radio 1 as one of the hottest new bands in the country. The band recorded a session for Huw Stephens's show on BBC Radio 1, which was broadcast on 29 March. This was followed by the addition of Peter Wright to the line-up. Another single, \\"Two Words & A Gesture\\", was released in November 2007. Vessels travelled to Minneapolis, United States to record their debut album, White Fields and Open Devices, with producer John Congleton who had previously worked with fellow post-rock artists Explosions in the Sky and This Will Destroy You as well as Modest Mouse, at Pachyderm Studios in December 2007. They completed recording of the ten-track album in twelve days and returned to the UK for a nationwide tour. On 16 June they released the single \\"A Hundred Times In Every Direction\\". Their debut album was released on 18 August. In May 2010 Vessels recorded the follow-up LP in Dallas, Texas, again with John Congleton and featuring vocals by Stuart Warwick of Jacob's Story. It was entitled Helioscope and was subsequently released in February 2011. In June 2011 Vessels headlined the BBC Introducing Stage at Glastonbury Festival. Reviews for Helioscope were above average included a 7.5 from Pitchfork Media and a 4.5 from Sputnik Music. Vessels released a third album, Dilate, in March 2015.Vessels Website - Dilate Announcement This record saw the band \\"moving away from the overt post-rock foundations of second album Helioscope\\" and into a more electronic sound. The music from Dilate is less guitar orientated and is instead based more heavily on synthesisers and percussion, leading to \\"danceable dynamics\\" that \\"resonate with focused heft and power\\". Metacritic, a website that gives an aggregate score based on numerous official and public reviews, gave the album a score of 77/100. Dilate was followed by The Great Distraction, released on 29 September 2017 by Different Recordings. The album featured several guest vocalists including John Grant and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips. This album \\"marks a further evolution for the group\\" who \\"have steadily pushed the boundaries of their post-rock foundations, with each of their...studio albums edging further into electronica territory\\".

Raymond grew up in Pasadena, California, the son of the owner of a luxury hotel. He completed a B.A. at Harvard University, and a M.S.Entry from MIT library archive. in aeronautical engineering at MIT in 1921. Raymond spent his entire career at the Douglas Aircraft Company. Beginning as a metal fitter, he rose to the rank of Chief Engineer, contributing to the design of all Douglas airliners from the DC-1 to the DC-8. During World War II, he helped managed the huge effort that produced tens of thousands of aircraft for that war. Raymond is best known as the lead designer of the DC-3, \\"The Plane That Changed the World,\\" the first airliner that could break even hauling passengers without a government subsidy and without carrying mail. The military equivalent of the DC-3 was the C-47. In Europe, the DC-3 was known as the \\"Dakota.\\" Raymond's grandson Stephen has said: \\"In the DC-3, he did almost everything. He knew every bolt and screw in that plane.\\" About 10,600 DC-3s and C-47s were eventually built between 1934 and 1945, making it the most produced airliner of all time. At the time of Raymond's death, about 2,000 DC-3s were still flying and about 400 were still in commercial service. After retiring from Douglas in 1960, NASA put Raymond in charge of supervising the outside contractors on Project Gemini and Project Apollo until 1969. When Boeing and other aerospace firms proposed in the late 1960s to build a supersonic airliner with substantial subsidies from the US government, Raymond argued that the plane was not commercially viable. The USA government ceased subsidizing the design of the American supersonic transport in 1971, whereupon it died. At the end of World War II, Raymond proposed to the USAF that they create an organization to think about intercontinental warfare. That organization became the Rand Corporation, of which he was a founding member. He was also a founding member of the National Academy of Engineering. In 1991 he received the National Air and Space Museum Lifetime Achievement Trophy. He died just 2 days before his 100th birthday.

They were the major herbivores on most of these islands until they became extinct after human settlement. Description The moa-nalo (the name literally means \\"lost fowl\\"; the plural and the singular are the same) were unknown to science, having been wiped out before the arrival of Captain James Cook (1778), until the early 1980s, when their subfossil remains were discovered in sand dunes on the islands of Molokai and Kauai. Subsequently, bones were found on Maui, Oahu, and LƒÅnai, in lava tubes, lake beds, and sinkholes. They represent four species in three genera so far: * Chelychelynechen quassus (turtle-jawed moa- nalo) from Kauai * Ptaiochen pau (small-billed moa-nalo) from Maui * Thambetochen xanion (O'ahu moa-nalo) from Oahu * Thambetochen chauliodous (Maui Nui large-billed moa-nalo) from Maui, LƒÅnai and Molokai (Maui Nui) Chelychelynechen, meaning turtle-jawed goose, had a large, heavy bill like that of a tortoise, while the other two genera, Thambetochen and Ptaiochen, all had serrations in their bills known as pseudoteeth, similar to those of mergansers. All species were flightless and large, with an average mass of . Evolution Reconstruction of Thambetochen xanion Rostrum and sternum of Thambetochen xanion Some moa-nalo fossils have been found to contain traces of mitochondrial DNA which were compared to living duck species in order to establish their place in the duck family, Anatidae. Contrary to the expectations of some scientists, the moa-nalo were not related to the large geese (Anserinae), such as the surviving nƒìnƒì, but instead to the dabbling ducks of the genus Anas, which includes the mallard. The present DNA analysis' resolution is not high enough to determine their relationships to different species of Anas, but biogeography strongly suggests that their closest living relative is the widespread Pacific black duck. Ecology A sapling of Cyanea platyphylla, showing the prickles that probably evolved as a defense against feeding by moa-nalo. Reconstruction of Chelychelychen quassus The unusual shape and size of the moa-nalo can be attributed to their role in the ecology of prehistoric Hawaii. A study of coprolites (fossil dung) of Thambetochen chauliodous found in Puu Naio Cave on lowland Maui has shown they were folivorous, at least in dry shrub or mesic forest habitats eating particularly fronds from ferns (possibly Asplenium nidus or Dryopteris wallichiana). This conclusion is backed up by the shapes of their beaks (James & Burney 1997). This indicates they were the principal browsers on the island. The presence of prominent spines on the leaves and soft young stems of several Hawaiian lobelioids in the genus Cyanea‚Äîunusual in an island flora where such defenses are frequently lost, as in the ƒÅkala (Hawaiian raspberry)‚Äîsuggests that the Cyanea evolved these thorn-like prickles on new growth because they protect against browsing by the moa-nalo. The moa-nalo themselves filled the niche of herbivore usually filled by mammals such as goats and deer, or the giant tortoises of Gal√°pagos and other archipelagoes. This has implications for the ecology of Hawaiian Islands today, as a major group of species have been lost. Like island taxa from Mauritius, New Zealand and Polynesia, the moa-nalo were unused to mammals and were easily taken by hunters or the animals that were introduced and became feral, such as domestic pigs.

Created by Grant Morrison (writer) and Arnie Jorgensen (pencils), the most recognized version made his first appearance in New Year's Evil: Prometheus (February 1998). Commonly an adversary of the Justice League, Prometheus would serve as an enemy of the superheroes Batman, Green Arrow and Midnighter. In 2009, Prometheus was ranked as IGN's 80th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.Prometheus is number 80 , IGN. Retrieved September 5, 2009. On The CW's live-action TV series Arrow, the character was portrayed by Josh Segarra and voiced by Michael Dorn.  Publication history  Curt Calhoun debuted in Blue Beetle #3 (Aug. 1986). A new version of Prometheus debuted in New Year's Evil: Prometheus (Feb. 1998) and returned in JLA #16‚Äì17 (March‚ÄìApril 1998) and #36‚Äì41 (Dec. 1999 ‚Äì May 2000). The character was then impersonated for a time by Chad Graham, but returned in Faces of Evil: Prometheus #1 (March 2009). Prometheus starred as the villain in the limited series Justice League: Cry for Justice #1‚Äì7 (Sept. 2009 ‚Äì April 2010), and was killed at the conclusion of the story. Writer Mike Conroy noted \\"...with his technologically advanced armor and weapons arsenal, which can download the fighting techniques of the world's top martial artists...he (Prometheus) turned out to be a formidable foe, as the JLA found out\\".Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004.  Fictional character biography  = Curt Calhoun = The original version, Curt Calhoun, debuted in Blue Beetle #3 (Aug. 1986), followed by appearances in issues #4 (Sept. 1986); #6 (Nov. 1986); #8‚Äì9 (Jan.‚ÄìFeb. 1987) and #11‚Äì13 (April‚ÄìJune 1987). Calhoun is a small-time criminal working for supervillain Doctor Alchemy and is hired to steal a quantity of the metal promethium from KORD Inc., an organization owned by Ted Kord. Although successful, both Calhoun and Dr. Alchemy are captured by the Blue Beetle. On release from prison, Calhoun aids the Blue Beetle against the Calculator and is offered a position as a foreman at KORD Inc. by Kord. While saving Kord from an industrial accident, Calhoun is covered with metals laced with promethium. En route to the hospital, Calhoun's ambulance is attacked by members of the supervillain team known as Hybrid. The leader, Mento, transforms the metal covering Calhoun into a permanent metallic shell. Assuming the \\"Prometheus\\" alias, the reluctant Calhoun fights alongside Hybrid in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat the New Teen Titans.Blue Beetle #4 (Sept. 1986); #6 (Nov. 1986); #8‚Äì9 (Jan.‚ÄìFeb. 1987) and #11‚Äì13 (April‚ÄìJune 1987) Although Mento eventually directs Hybrid against the Titans once again, they rebel and Mento is apparently cured of his insanity by Titan member Raven.New Teen Titans #34 (Aug. 1987) Calhoun is never seen again, until the superhero JSA team learns that Hybrid died in the gladiatorial games staged by villainess Roulette.JSA #28 (Nov. 2001) The original version possesses a metal epidermis, which confers superior strength and durability. Calhoun is also capable of raising the temperature of his armored form to several hundred degrees Celsius. = Unnamed version = The most well-known version is the unnamed son of two hippie spree killers, who traveled across the United States with them until they were cornered by local law enforcement and were gunned down after opening fire on the surrounding police. This traumatic experience causes his hair to turn white, and he vows to \\"annihilate the forces of justice\\" in order to get revenge for his slain parents. Using his parents' hidden caches of money, the son travels the world and develops his skills, becoming an underground pit- fighter in Brazil and a mercenary in Africa, and joining terrorist groups in the Middle East. After avenging his parents' deaths by murdering the police officer who shot them, he locates the Himalayan city of Shambhala, inhabited by a sect of monks that worshiped the concept of evil. Prometheus discovers the monastery has been built on an alien spaceship, and the leader of the sect is one of the creatures from the vessel. He kills the alien and obtains the \\"Ghost Key\\", which opens a portal to the \\"Ghost Zone\\". Prometheus builds a house in the void as his headquarters, which is warped by the dimensional effects to become \\"crooked\\". He relates his origin to a young man, with the alias \\"Retro\\", who has won a competition to be part of the JLA for a day. Prometheus kills Retro, copies the young man's mannerisms (courtesy of his advanced helmet), and joins the tour group at the JLA transporters, intending to masquerade as Retro to gain access to the JLA Watchtower.New Year's Evil: Prometheus (Feb. 1998) Initially, the plan appears to be successful, with Prometheus infecting Steel's armor with a virus, hitting the Martian Manhunter with a dart containing a toxin that destabilizes his ability to control his shape, knocking out Huntress, trapping Zauriel in the Ghost Zone, beating Batman senseless using downloaded skills, using neural chaff to disrupt Green Lantern's will, and informing Flash that the tower is rigged with bombs that will detonate if he moves too fast. He then tries to force Superman to kill himself so that Prometheus will allow civilians to leave, on the grounds that Superman was too powerful for him to devise a means of killing. Prometheus is then caught off guard by the anti-hero Catwoman, who had also infiltrated the tour group, allowing the heroes time to recover. Steel infects Prometheus's systems with a virus. Admitting he lied about the bombs, Prometheus escapes to the Ghost Zone before he can be captured.JLA #16‚Äì17 (March‚ÄìApril 1998) Prometheus appears briefly during an encounter between the JLA and the Avengers and skirmishes with Captain America while using Batman's skills, but Captain America easily defeats him.JLA/Avengers #1 ‚Äì 4 (Sept. 2003 ‚Äì May 2004) Prometheus returns as a member of Lex Luthor's second Injustice Gang. During the confusion caused by the arrival of the weapon Mageddon, Prometheus is able to use a White Martian space vessel abandoned in the Ghost Zone to infiltrate the Watchtower and attack Oracle. Oracle escapes, with Prometheus's helmet being damaged in the process. The villain retrieves his original helmet (lost during the first battle with the JLA) and battles Batman once again. Prometheus is neutralized when Batman sabotages his helmet, overriding the information on the disc Prometheus uses to upload his combat skills and replacing the data with the physical skills and coordination of Professor Stephen Hawking. Batman prevents fellow member Huntress from killing Prometheus.JLA #36‚Äì41 (Dec. 1999 ‚Äì May 2000) Batman and Martian Manhunter take Prometheus into custody and arrange to reduce Prometheus's brain to a mentally disabled state in order to permanently end his threat, reasoning that his skills and training mean that no jail could hold him under conventional circumstances. Upon Martian Manhunter's death at Libra's hands, Prometheus's mind was restored and he tracked down Chad Graham, killing his would-be protege and maiming/murdering members of the Blood Pack super-hero team.Faces of Evil: Prometheus #1 (March 2009)  Cry for Justice  A spate of superhero deaths (Freedom Beast, Gloss, and Tasmanian Devil) and attacks on others (Barry Allen, Batwoman, and Crimson Avenger) is revealed to be the work of the true Prometheus. The villain impersonates Freddy Freeman and gains access to the JLA satellite, which in turn allows Prometheus to place teleportation devices in the home cities of various heroes which will \\"strand\\" them in various places in the past and future, as revenge for the years that he spent with his mind damaged. Prometheus also maims Roy Harper after Harper realizes his foe is not Freddy Freeman. After defeating the JLA and the Teen Titans by reading files on them, Prometheus is captured by Donna Troy and beaten brutally, until being stopped by the Shade. Prometheus offers to reveal the location of the devices in exchange for his release, after they malfunction and begin destroying the cities. With Star City suffering massive casualties (including Roy's daughter), Prometheus's ultimatum is met and he returns to his lair, but he is murdered by Green Arrow shooting an arrow through his head.Justice League: Cry for Justice #1‚Äì7 (Sept. 2009 ‚Äì April 2010)  The New 52  Prometheus shows up to torment Midnighter using stolen technology from the God Garden that he sells to various individuals around the world. In addition, he acquires the Gardener's secret files on Midnighter's true identity and origin. When confronted by Midnighter, Prometheus uses God Garden technology to block Midnighter's tactical computer, eliminating the edge Midnighter has in analyzing an opponent's fighting techniques. Prometheus also reveals that he has downloaded all of Midnighter's own skills into his brain to use against his enemy. Pretending to be an ordinary man, he uses the alias Matt Dell to seduce and have a romantic relationship with Midnighter to achieve his goals.Midnighter #7 (July 2016) = Chad Graham = The third version, Chad Graham, debuted in Batman: Gotham Knights #52 (June 2004), as part of the \\"Pushback\\" storyline from issues #50‚Äì55 (April‚ÄìSept. 2004). The villain reappeared in Batman: Gotham Knights #66 (Aug. 2005); Villains United #1‚Äì6 (July‚ÄìSept. 2005); Infinite Crisis #1‚Äì7 (Dec. 2005 ‚Äì June 2006); Birds of Prey #94 (June‚ÄìAug. 2006); Teen Titans vol. 3, #51‚Äì54 (Nov. 2007 ‚Äì Feb. 2008) and Final Crisis #1‚Äì7 (July 2008 ‚Äì March 2009). He was not initially established as a different version from the second version until the \\"Faces of Evil\\" issue that featured the second version's return. It was later revealed that his former apprentice assumed the Prometheus identity after the well-known version went into a mentally disabled state; Graham had been taken in by Prometheus to serve as an evil sidekick years earlier, but proved too impulsive and ended up leaving Prometheus (under unknown circumstances). Graham appears in Star City, battling Green Arrow and local law enforcement. Almost killed by Green Arrow, Graham is saved by Hush. Hush forms an alliance with the impostor but abandons him due to his incompetence.Batman: Gotham Knights #50‚Äì55 (April‚ÄìSept. 2004) Talia al Ghul leads Kobra in search of Prometheus in a bid to secure his Ghost Key. Graham, poisoned by Poison Ivy, is saved once again by Hush.Batman: Gotham Knights #66 (Aug. 2005) Graham is then recruited to join another version of the Secret Society of Super VillainsVillains United #1 ‚Äì 6 (July‚ÄìSept. 2005) and participates in a massive attack by the Society on Metropolis. During the battle, Graham kills Peacemaker.Infinite Crisis #1 ‚Äì 7 (Dec. 2005 ‚Äì June 2006) Graham also has an encounter with the Birds of Prey and defeats Lady Shiva in seconds.Birds of Prey #94 (June‚ÄìAug. 2006) He eventually falls under the alien Starro's control but is freed once Starro is defeated.Teen Titans vol. 3, #51 ‚Äì 54 (Nov. 2007 ‚Äì Feb. 2008) Graham is later murdered when the true Prometheus regains himself; he expresses contempt for Graham's impersonation but is satisfied that the damage Graham has done to Prometheus's reputation would lead to the heroes underestimating him in the future. The third version relies on the use of two pistols, although he also possesses his mentor's helmet and artificial skills, giving him the training to defeat even Lady Shiva in a matter of seconds.  Powers and abilities  Prometheus possesses no superhuman abilities, but has undergone intense physical and mental training and utilizes an extensive range of equipment and technology like the hero Batman. Common tools include body armor, gauntlets that fire various projectiles, a side-handle baton with several technological features, and a helmet that in addition to emitting strobe lighting capable of disorientation and hypnotism, can download the knowledge and physical skills of others directly into his brain via a compact disc, his default disc including the skills of thirty of the world's greatest martial artists. Where Prometheus obtains this information is not known, but his combat skills include the duplicated abilities of Batman and Lady Shiva, although it is unclear how much combat training he would possess if he had to fight without the helmet. The 'battlesuit'/helmet combination is also equipped with an artificial Intelligence that can rapidly calculate and deploy a variety of strategies and countermeasures that have allowed Prometheus at various times to incapacitate entire groups of the Justice League singlehandedly and simultaneously. Finally, the unnamed version possesses the \\"Ghost Key\\" which allows the villain to teleport himself and other objects and persons to and from a dimension called the \\"Ghost Zone\\". It can also be used to inflict total molecular disintegration on a target, but Prometheus only employed this function once, when he eliminated the unsuspecting Retro. The helmet can be hacked by external sources, but Batman had to study the helmet for a month to learn how to hack it in that manner, and it is unclear if this would allow him to hack other versions of the helmet.  Other versions  = JLA/Avengers = In JLA/Avengers, Prometheus is seen among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold in issue #4. He is seen being seized by Green Lantern. Later, he confronts Captain America, having downloaded Batman's fighting skills. However, using his shield, Captain America defeats Prometheus. = Smallville: Lantern = Prometheus is featured in Smallville Season 11, a comic book continuation of the TV series. At Daily Planet, Lois Lane and Oliver Queen hold a video-conference with Steve Trevor and Diana Prince of D.E.O. about the theft on their premises by a man in advanced weaponry. The Green Arrow joins D.E.O.'s team, led by agent Cameron Chase in their search for the man who stole from its facilities. When they find Prometheus, the mercenary attacks them with all kinds of weapons making them temporarily lose their hearing and sight. As he goes through D.E.O.'s soldiers he leaves Oliver for the end and after he takes him out, he says \\"Game on\\" and passes through a Boom Tube. Prometheus and his men arrive at Fort Knox via Boom Tube, intending to steal the gold that is kept there, but Green Arrow is waiting for them, with help from Zatanna. After taking out his men, a one-on- one battle ensues between Arrow and Prometheus. Prometheus wonders if Green Arrow cares about his real identity but Oliver says that if he is not his counterpart from a parallel Earth he doesn't really care about it. During the fight, Oliver succeeds to get the upper hand and start beating Prometheus, raging over what he had done to Agent Chase's team and the fact that he almost took him away from his child, finishing him off with a massive headbutt.Smallville: Lantern #2 = Power Rangers/Justice League = When Lord Zedd and Brainiac form an alliance to steal the Power Rangers' Power Coins and attack their world, the League permit the Rangers to access their archives to provide them with equipment and resources to battle their enemies' forces until they can regain their powers, with Billy Cranston using Prometheus's helmet and armour.Power Rangers/Justice League #4  In other media  = Television = Two heavily adapted versions of Prometheus appear in The CW's live-action Arrowverse, both of which are voiced by Michael Dorn when masked. The character's depiction is a dark hooded individual who wields a sword, a bow, and shurikens. * Josh Segarra portrays Earth-1's version, who was born Simon Morrison, on Arrow. He is season five's main antagonist as a dark mirror to Oliver Queen / Green Arrow. After his criminal father Justin Claybourne is killed by the hooded Arrow vigilante, he trained under former League of Assassins member Talia al Ghul to acquire similar fighting techniques, and learns Oliver's secret identity. Five years later, Simon adopts the alias of \\"Adrian Chase\\" to be Star City's District Attorney to get close to Oliver, while simultaneously terrorizing Oliver's vigilante team as the serial killer Prometheus (dubbed as the Throwing Star Killer by the media). As both Prometheus and Chase, Morrison embarks on a crusade to destroy Oliver's reputation as both the Green Arrow and Mayor in City Hall, deals with the other individuals (crime lord Tobias Church and the Vigilante) making attempts on Oliver, plants evidence to frame Quentin Lance for his own murders, convinces Evelyn Sharp to betray Team Arrow, manipulates Green Arrow into killing police detective Billy Malone (dressed with the Prometheus costume) and leaks his cover up to the press to trigger an impeachment hearing that forces Oliver to publicly disown Green Arrow as a cop killer, has Laurel Lance / Black Siren as an enforcer, and tricks John Diggle into being detained by the authorities before exonerating the man. At the cost of his own wife's life, Morrison captures Oliver with Talia's help as both seek revenge on Queen for killing their respective fathers. Being certain that Oliver's heroic identity and crusade are merely a pretext, Morrison proceeds to torture Oliver (physically and psychologically) into confessing of enjoying killing targets before setting his nemesis free. His Chase alias is exposed and Morrison forced to go into hiding, when Felicity Smoak and Curtis Holt reverse-engineer the technology he uses to blur his face from surveillance cameras when unmasked in his Prometheus outfit. He teams up with Derek Sampson to release his father's weaponized tuberculosis on Star City while also trying to destroy Robert Queen's legacy before being captured by Green Arrow. While in A.R.G.U.S. custody, Morrison has his team kidnap Team Arrow and William Clayton, forcing Oliver to release him. No longer using his Prometheus alias at this point, Morrison and his associates go to Lian Yu, chased by Oliver's allies. The two sides clash with Oliver's allies emerging victorious. Incapacitated and unwilling to accept defeat, Morrison commits suicide which triggers his dead man's switch and blows up the C4 planted on Lian Yu, resulting in Samantha Clayton's death and Thea Queen being left in a coma. In season six, Morrison appears in a hallucination when Oliver's exposed to Vertigo. * Colin Donnell portrays the Earth-X version of Tommy Merlyn during the four-part crossover \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\". = Video games = * The unnamed iteration of Prometheus appears in the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of Justice League Heroes. * The unnamed iteration of Prometheus is mentioned in Batman: Arkham Asylum. Batman scanning a wanted poster featuring Prometheus in the Penitentiary's Guard Room will serve as an answer to one of the Riddler's riddles and will unlock Prometheus's profile. * The unnamed iteration of Prometheus is mentioned in Batman: Arkham City. He's referenced in several newspapers detailing two criminals being gunned down in an alley while their son (Prometheus) watches. There's also a psych report which regards Prometheus's release approval from Arkham Island on the GCPD forensics lab's wall. * The Simon Morrison version of Prometheus from Arrow appears as a playable character in the DC TV Super-Villains DLC pack in Lego DC Super- Villains.

With a population of 242,548 as per the 2011 census, it is the largest city in the province and also serves as the headquarters of Morang district. Biratnagar is located east of the capital, Kathmandu and north of the bordering town of Jogbani in the Indian state of Bihar. The highest peak in the world, Mount Everest, is located north of the city. Biratnagar was declared a metropolitan city on 22 May 2017, thus pushing the total population to over 240,000 making it the fourth most populated metropolitan city in the country after the urban agglomeration of Kathmandu and Lalitpur, Pokhara, and Bharatpur. The city is home to the Biratnagar Jute Mills, the first large scale industry of Nepal. It also serves as an entry point to eastern Nepal as well as north-eastern India. Biratnagar is the second Nepalese city, after Janakpur, to have a connection with the Indian Railways and the only city after Birgunj to operate an integrated check post (ICP) on the Indian border. Considered to be the industrial capital of Nepal, the city is also the birthplace of five prime ministers of Nepal, in addition to being host to a number of revolutionary incidents in the country including the first labor strike which led to the anti-Rana movements. History The old name of Biratnagar was Gograha Bazaar. The ruins of temples, palaces and ponds are scattered in a vast area to the south of the current city, in Vedhyari, Buddhanagar. The preservation of these heritages have been a major problem citing the encroachment by newcomers into the city. In 1914, Colonel Jit Bahadur Khatri, the then district governor, laid the foundations of modern Biratnagar by moving the hospital, post office, prison and the customs, land registry, forestry and auditor offices to Gograha Bazaar from Rangeli, the then district capital of Morang. The town was named Biratnagar in 1919 (1976 BS) by Keshar Shamsher Rana after ruins of a palace, thought to be of King Virat, and other objects of historical importance were found. The ruins of the palace along with stone carved tools, idols, and household objects can be seen preserved to the south of Biratnagar, close to the border. In Nepali, Birat () means \\"Huge\\" and Nagar () means \\"City\\". On 4 March 1947, the first anti-Rana movement in Nepal started in Biratnagar at the Biratnagar jute mills under the leadership of Girija Prasad Koirala and B. P. Koirala. This sparked a countrywide anti-Rana demonstration that eventually led to the abolishment of Rana rule in Nepal. Climate The highest temperature ever recorded in Biratnagar was on the 14 April 1992, while the lowest temperature ever recorded was in December 1970 and January 1971. Demography =Population and ethnicity= Kali MandirAccording to 2011 CBS census data, the population of Biratnagar was 214,663.\\"National Population Census 2011\\" Majority of the people are from the Brahmin and Kshatriya communities. The main language spoken is Nepali. Maithili is also spoken by a sizable proportion of the population. The local indigenous language is Birat Rajbanshi, also known as Khotta/Khoratha. English is well understood by the educated mass. Biratnagar is situated within one of the most ethnically diverse regions of Nepal, and the rural hinterland is home to a diverse cross section of communities. =Religion= Most people practice Hinduism followed by Islam, Jainism, Kirat, and Christianity. Biratnagar is known for its high-spirited festival celebration. During Dashain, the largest festival in the country, a large number of devotees visit the Kali Mandir, a temple dedicated to Goddess Kali, that lies in the heart of the town.Chhath Puja festivities Krishna Janmashtami (the birthday of Krishna) is a major festival celebrated in Biratnagar. Thousands of people gather on the second day of Krishna Ashtami for the holy chariot procession () which goes around the city, approximately . This event is termed the Rath Yatra (). It is the largest such procession in Nepal and the second largest in Asia.https://2018.biratnagar.wordcamp.org/12-facts- about-biratnagar/ It is believed that the Rath was driven by Lord Krishna himself. So, a young child is placed in the chariot as a symbol of Krishna and is taken around the city with joy to celebrate Lord Krishna's birthday. Some people stay on top of the Rath to distribute prasad (holy offerings) to numerous devotees observing the holy procession. The Rath is followed by many smaller carts pulled by oxen. People in the smaller carts play music and sing hymns of joy and happiness. Chhath () is an important festival for Madheshi Hindus, dedicated to the Sun God. The festivities are performed by Hindu women in order to thank Surya (the sun) for sustaining life on earth and to request for certain wishes on the banks of rivers and ponds. Chhath festivities are performed mostly on the banks of Singhiya and Keshalia rivers in Biratnagar. Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are celebrated by the Muslim community of Biratnagar. Christmas is also celebrated by a very small population of Christians. Transport left *Air: Biratnagar Airport serves as a regional hub for the eastern part of the country. A subtotal of 10 flights per day are operated to Kathmandu which makes it the busiest domestic airport in the country after Pokhara. Frequent flights are also operated to Tumlingtar as well as other airports within the country. alt= * Road: Biratnagar is roughly by road from Kathmandu. It is also well connected to all the parts of Province No. 1 including Dharan, Itahari and Dhankuta as well as to most parts of the country through regular bus service. The easternmost border-point of Kakarbhitta lies at a distance of from the city and can be reached via frequent buses running half-hourly from the buspark. left * Trains: There are direct trains from the Indian cities of Katihar, Kolkata and New Delhi to the border town of Jogbani. The rail line ends in Jogbani, Araria district on the Indian side. Biratnagar is north of Nepal's southern border with Bihar, India. The crossing has a customs checkpoint for goods called as Rani Bhansar. Indian and Nepalese nationals cross the border freely. A monorail extension to Biratnagar has been proposed and surveyed. As of 1 August 2019, the provincial government of Province No. 1 plans to establish a monorail system running 30 km (19 mi) from Rani, Biratnagar to Itahari at an estimated budget of Rs. 30 billion. * Intracity: Cycle, motor vehicles, rickshaws, and taxis serve the city center. Auto rickshaws (Tempos) are available for longer distances outside the center. City safari or electric rickshaws are the most used transportation here, connect all parts of Biratnagar, and are very cheap as well as environmentally friendly. Economy Morang Vyapar Sangh Gate Biratnagar is the economic center of eastern Nepal. The first industry of Nepal, the Biratnagar jute mills, was established here. Biratnagar is driven by startup culture. The multi-million business house, Golchha Organisation, has its roots in Biratnagar where it started as a small startup business. In addition to more than 6000 industries, Biratnagar is connected to a major custom route with India and has the second largest land port in Nepal. Considered to be the industrial capital of Nepal, the unemployment rate in Biratnagar is very low due to large concentration of industries and labour works. Tourism Biratnagar is a hub for explorers of places in eastern Nepal like Ilam, Taplejung, Sankhuwasabha and Panchthar. A number of colorful haat bazaars (weekly markets) are held each week in different parts of the town, where farmers from the rural hinterland set up stalls to trade agricultural produce, spices and handicrafts. There are several gardens, temples and places of religious importance in Biratnagar. Gopal garden, located near Hathkhola and Hridreyandra Bal Udhhyan near Thulo Mill are two main gardens. Temples have been the jewel of Biratnagar. They are decorated in vibrant ways to make them attractive. Dharan is and Itahari is north of Biratnagar. These places are famous for Taltalaiya, Ocean Park, Gokulam Resort, Dantakali Temple, Pindeshwor Temple, Budha Subba Temple and Panch Kanya. The hill-station of Bhedetar is a local viewpoint. The tea gardens of Ilam are approximately 4 hours' drive away. Another place of interest is the hilly district of Dhankuta with its orange orchards. The Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, popular with bird-watching enthusiasts, is a 90-minute drive from the city. It is home to the endangered wild buffaloes called \\"Arna\\" in Nepali. The largest rhododendron forests of Tinjure, Milke and Jaljale can be reached in about 3‚Äì4 hours. Treks with views of Mt. Makalu and Kanchenjunga can be started from the small towns of Basantapur or Tumlingtar. Politics Governor (Badahakim) Shiva Pratap Shumsher Thapa, Rana-Era Governor of Morang The district headquarters of Morang were moved to Biratnagar from Rangeli in 1914 by the then district governor, Colonel Jit Bahadur Khatri. The next governor, Shiva Pratap Shumsher Thapa, further developed the town. Krishna Prasad Koirala was the first major political leader based in Biratnagar. His sons Matrika Prasad Koirala and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala were the prime ministers of Nepal after the fall of the Rana rule. Since then Biratnagar has been a major contributor to Nepali politics, and is the most politically active city in the country. Girija Prasad Koirala, the younger brother of Matrika and BP Koirala, was elected prime minister on four occasions; from 1991 to 1994, 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2001, and from 2006 to 2008.He also served as the acting Head of State from January 2007 to July 2008. Man Mohan Adhikari, the first communist prime minister of Nepal was also born in Biratnagar. Leaders like Bharat Mohan Adhikari, Shailaja Acharya, Sushil Koirala, Lal Babu Pandit, Amod Prasad Upadhyay and Mahesh Acharya all hail from this city. The 1973 plane hijack, which was to fund the political revolution, took place at the Biratnagar Airport. The hijack plan, masterminded by Girija Prasad Koirala, was executed by Durga Subedi, Nagendra Dhungel and Basant Bhattarai. Nepali Congress's Bheem Parajuli and Indira Karki are the current mayor and deputy mayor of the metropolitan respectively. Education Biratnagar is the center of education in eastern of Nepal. Home to the Purbanchal University, Biratnagar has a number of good colleges and educational institutes including medical and engineering institutes. The medium of teaching is English in all the private schools, colleges and universities whereas Nepali is the medium of instruction in government schools up to secondary level. There are more than 80 schools, over 20 colleges and 21 hospitals in Biratnagar, the most after Kathmandu. Art and literature Biratnagar has been the ground for many literary personalities: Dev Kumari Thapa, Bal Krishna Pokhrel, Bhanubhakta Pokhrel, Parshu Pradhan, Kabiraj Neupane, Dadhiraj Subedi, Biwas Pokhrel, Nawaraj Subba, Sima Avas, Choodamani Nepal and others. Some of the prominent books in Nepali literature have emerged from Biratnagar. Landmark books in Nepali poetry, Bholi Basne Bihan by Krishna Bhushan Bal and Jeevanko Chheubaata by Suman Pokhrel were published in this city. There is a popular culture of poetry recitation in regular sessions in various locations of Biratnagar.Dadhiraj Subedi, \\"‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§®‡§π‡§∞‡•Ç (The Smiles of Nepali Literature)\\"- 2012, Purwanchal Sahitya Academy, Biratnagar - Sports Sahid Rangsala Football and cricket are the most popular sports in Biratnagar. Sahid Rangsala with a capacity of 10,000+ spectators is the largest football stadium in the city. Sahid Maidan is the home stadium of Morang Football Club. The Mahendra Gold Cup, now Birat Gold Cup, is held in the stadium along with district divisional league matches. There is a covered hall nearby Sahid Maidan where indoor events can be organized. A cricket stadium is being constructed in Baijanathpur on the outskirts of Biratnagar with the objective of organizing local and national- level cricket tournaments.

One notable passage on page seven of the 35-page speech is referred to as \\"The Man in the Arena\\": > It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong > man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The > credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred > by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes > short again and again, because there is no effort without error and > shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great > enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who > at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the > worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place > shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor > defeat. Someone who is heavily involved in a situation that requires courage, skill, or tenacity (as opposed to someone sitting on the sidelines and watching), is sometimes referred to as \\"the man in the arena\\". In popular culture The \\"Man in the Arena\\" passage was quoted by another US president, Richard Nixon, both in his victory speech on November 6, 1968, and in his resignation address to the nation on August 8, 1974: > Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed, but always I have > taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the > arena, 'whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, [...] Nelson Mandela gave a copy of this speech to Fran√ßois Pienaar, captain of the South African rugby team, before the start of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, in which the South African side eventually defeated the heavily favoured All Blacks of New Zealand. In the film based on those events, the poem \\"Invictus\\" is used instead. Mark DeRosa, an American professional baseball utility player then with the Washington Nationals, read the passage to teammates prior to the Nationals' pivotal Game Four versus the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2012 National League Division Series which was won on a walk-off home run by the Nationals' Jayson Werth. Since his days at the University of Pennsylvania, DeRosa would turn to those words before important games. American scholar, Bren√© Brown, quotes this excerpt in the Netflix Special, \\"The Call to Courage\\"; she also used a somewhat abbreviated version of the quote in her March 2012 TED talk \\"Listening to Shame,\\" and subsequently as the inspiration for the title of her book, Daring Greatly (2012). When then Ferrari Formula One driver Jean Alesi was about to start the last lap of the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix (which would become his only Grand Prix win), then ESPN commentator Bob Varsha used parts of Roosevelt¬¥s speech, saying that Alesi looked a while like being the man Roosevelt had talked about. The \\"Man in the Arena\\" passage was used in a 2015 ad for Cadillac, ending with \\"dare greatly\\". At the 2016 Democratic National Convention President Barack Obama cited the speech in his endorsement speech of Hillary Clinton. Lindsey Stirling's 2016 album release Brave Enough features a song titled \\"The Arena\\". The inspiration for this song comes from this speech. The music video for the track also starts out with a quotation from this speech. LeBron James has #ManInTheArena written on his shoes. Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy are required to memorize \\"The Man in the Arena\\" during their indoctrination training.

It is considered the benchmark of extratropical wind storms. The storm ranks among the most intense to strike the region since at least 1948, likely since the January 9, 1880 \\"Great Gale\\" and snowstorm. The storm is a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 \\"Storm of the Century\\" and the \\"1991 Halloween Nor'easter\\" (\\"The Perfect Storm\\"). The system brought strong winds to the Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada, and was linked to 46 fatalities in the northwest and Northern California resulting from heavy rains and mudslides. Storm description Storm trajectory compared to two other important storms hitting the Pacific Northwest in 1981 and 1995 The path of Typhoon Freda Typhoon Freda formed from Wake Island in the central Pacific Ocean. The system became an extratropical cyclone as it moved into colder waters and interacted with the jet stream. The low redeveloped intensely off Northern California due to favorable upper level conditions, producing record rainfalls in the San Francisco Bay Area that delayed some games in the 1962 World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees. The low moved northeastward, and then hooked straight north as it neared southwest Oregon. The storm then raced nearly northward at an average speed of , with the center just off the Pacific Coast. There was little central pressure change until the cyclone passed the latitude of Astoria, Oregon, at which time the low began to degrade. The center passed over Tatoosh Island, Washington, before landing on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it weakened rapidly. As the cyclone moved through Canada, another cyclone formed on its southern periphery, which merged with this cyclone by October 17. The extratropical wave cyclone deepened to a minimum central pressure of at least , and perhaps as low as , a pressure which would be equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson hurricane scale. Since it was an extratropical cyclone, its wind field was neither as compact nor as strong as a tropical cyclone. All-time record- low land-based pressures (up to 1962) included at Astoria, at Hoquiam, Washington, and at North Bend, Oregon. The Astoria and Hoquiam records were broken by a major storm on December 12, 1995 (which measured at Astoria); this event, however, did not generate winds as intense as the Columbus Day Storm of 1962. Wind speed highlights Most of these peak gusts were taken at official stations The peak winds were felt as the storm passed close by on October 12. At Oregon's Cape Blanco, an anemometer that lost one of its cups registered wind gusts in excess of ; some reports put the peak velocity at . The north Oregon coast Mt. Hebo radar station reported winds of . At the Naselle Radar Station in the Willapa Hills of southwest Washington, a wind gust of was observed. In Salem, Oregon, a wind gust of was observed. At Corvallis, Oregon, an inland location in the Willamette Valley, one-minute average winds reached , with a gust to , before the station was abandoned due to \\"power failure and instruments demolished\\". Observations at the weather station resumed the next day. About to the north, at Portland, Oregon's major metropolitan area, measured wind gusts reached at the Morrison Street Bridge in downtown Portland. A peak gust of was observed in Vancouver, Washington at Pearson Field, around to the north of downtown Portland. Many anemometers, official and unofficial, within the heavily stricken area of northwestern Oregon and southwest Washington were damaged or destroyed before winds attained maximum velocity. For example, the wind gauge atop the downtown Portland studios of KGW radio and TV recorded two gusts of , just before flying debris knocked the gauge off-line shortly after 5 p.m. For the Willamette Valley, the lowest peak gust officially measured was at Eugene. This value, however, is higher than the maximum peak gust generated by any other Willamette Valley windstorm in the 1948‚Äì2010 period. In the interior of western Washington, officially measured wind gusts included at Olympia, at McChord Air Force Base, at Renton at and at Bellingham. In the city of Seattle, a peak wind speed of was recorded; this suggests gusts of at least . Damaging winds reached as far inland as Spokane. Wind gusts of , the National Weather Service minimum for \\"High Wind Criteria,\\" or higher were reported from San Francisco, to Vancouver, British Columbia. Impact At least 46 fatalities were attributed to this storm, more than for any other Pacific Northwest weather event. Injuries went into the hundreds. In terms of natural disaster-related fatalities for the 20th century, only Oregon's Heppner Flood of 1903 (247 deaths), Washington's Wellington avalanche of 1910 (96 deaths), the Great Fire of 1910 (87 deaths), and Eruption of Mount St. Helens of 1980 (57 deaths) caused more. For Pacific Northwest windstorms in the 20th century, the runner up was the infamous October 21, 1934, gale, which caused 22 fatalities, mostly in Washington. In less than 12 hours, more than 11 billion board feet (26,000,000 m3) of timber was blown down in northern California, Oregon and Washington combined; some estimates put it at 15 billion board feet (35,000,000 m3). This exceeded the annual timber harvest for Oregon and Washington at the time. This value is above any blowdown measured for East Coast storms, including hurricanes; even the often-cited 1938 New England hurricane, which toppled 2.65 billion board feet (6,300,000 m3), falls short by nearly an order of magnitude. Estimates put the dollar damage at approximately $230 million to $280 million for California, Oregon and Washington combined. Those figures in 1962 dollars translate to $1.8 Billion to $2.2 Billion in 2014 Dollars. Oregon's share exceeded $200 million in 1962 dollars. This is comparable to land-falling hurricanes that occurred within the same time frame (for example, Audrey, Donna, and Carla from 1957 to 1961). The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (now MetLife) named the Columbus Day Storm the nation's worst natural disaster of 1962. =California= In Central and Northern California, all-time record rains associated with the atmospheric river along the cold front caused major flooding and mudslides, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. Oakland set an all time calendar day record with of rain on the 13th, as did Sacramento with . More than of rainfall were recorded in the Bay area.J. L. Baldwin Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin. U.S. Department of Commerce, p. 1. Heavy rain forced Game 6 of the 1962 World Series at San Francisco's Candlestick Park to be postponed from its originally scheduled date of October 11 to Monday, October 15. =Oregon= Damage in Newberg, Oregon In the Willamette Valley, it is said the undamaged home was the exception. Livestock suffered greatly due to the barn failures: the animals were crushed under the weight of the collapsed structures, a story that was repeated many times throughout the afflicted region. At the north end of the Valley, two high voltage transmission towers were toppled. Radio and TV broadcasting were affected in the Portland area. KGW-TV lost its tower at Skyline and replaced the temporary tower with a new one on January 28, 1963. KOIN radio lost one of two AM towers at Sylvan. KPOJ-AM/-FM lost much of its transmitting equipment, plus one of two towers was left partially standing at Mount Scott. KPOJ-FM was so badly damaged it wouldn't return to the air until February 9, 1963. KWJJ-AM lost one of its towers and a portion of its transmitter building at Smith Lake. KISN-AM also lost a tower at Smith Lake. Seven-month-old TV station KATU did not receive any damage at its Livingston Mountain site, north of Camas, Washington. However, KATU didn't have a generator and power was cut off. The heavy-duty design of the radio towers on Portland's West Hills today, with extensive and robust guy cables, is a direct result of the lessons learned from the 1962 catastrophe. For northwest Oregon, the entire power distribution system had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Some locations did not have power restored for several weeks. This storm became a lasting memory for local power distributors. Indeed, a number of high wind related studies appeared in the years after the storm in an attempt to assess the return frequency of such potentially damaging winds. The state capitol grounds at Salem, and the state's college campuses, resembled battlefields with heavy losses of trees. The Campbell Hall tower at Oregon College of Education (now Western Oregon University) in Monmouth crashed to the ground, an event recorded by student photographer Wes Luchau in the most prominent picture-symbol of the storm. East of Salem, the wind destroyed a historic barn that served as a clandestine meeting place by pro-slavery Democratic members of the state Legislature in 1860. The Oregon State Beavers‚ÄìWashington Huskies college football game went on as scheduled Saturday, October 13 in Portland, in a heavily damaged Multnomah Stadium. Much of the roof was damaged and seats damaged by falling debris were replaced by portable chairs. Crews cleared debris from the grandstand and playing field right up to kickoff. Most of the electricity, including the scoreboard and clock, was still out and players dressed by candlelight in the locker rooms. The Huskies came from behind to beat the Beavers 14‚Äì13, despite a strong performance by quarterback Terry Baker, who would win the Heisman Trophy later that year. =British Columbia= The storm weakened as it travelled north into British Columbia, with peak gusts measured at . Five people in British Columbia were killed in the storm, and the area suffered $80 million in damages. Stanley Park lost 3,000 trees. A Victoria resident described it as \\"Just general devastation everywhere you went. There were trees breaking off and flying across the roads. \\"Wind was just blowing the rain horizontal and trees were weaving all over the place. You didn't know if you were going to get hit or not.\\" See also * Hanukkah Eve windstorm of 2006 * Great Coastal Gale of 2007 * Great Olympic Blowdown of 1921 * October 2009 North American storm complex * January 2010 North American winter storms * January 2012 Pacific Northwest snowstorm References Further reading * External links * Windstorms Brochure (PDF) from the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Portland, Oregon  * 1962 in Oregon 1962 meteorology 1962 natural disasters Natural disasters in Oregon Natural disasters in Washington (state) Pacific Northwest storms Natural disasters in British Columbia 1962 natural disasters in the United States 1962 disasters in Canada ","title":"Columbus Day Storm of 1962"},{"id":"1200177","text":"Main Porch, in the baroque style, and towers of the San Francisco Church Bas√≠lica y Convento de San Francisco is the Spanish name for Saint Francis Monastery located in Lima, Peru, south of Parque la Muralla and one block northeast from the Plaza Mayor, Lima. The church and convent are part of the Historic Centre of Lima, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991. Aside from a church and monastery it also contains a library and catacombs. In this church, Jude the Apostle is venerated. At the feast of Saint Jude Tadeus a one and a half ton weighing silver stand is carried round in procession by 40 people, starting from the convent.  Architecture  Interior of the temple. The church and monastery were blessed in 1673 and completed in 1674. Though it survived several earthquakes intact in 1687 and 1746, it suffered extensive damage in an earthquake in 1970. The church is noted for its architecture, a high example of Spanish Baroque. Its granite carved portal would later influence those on other churches, including the Church of Merced. The vaults of the central and two side naves are painted in mudejar style: a mix of Moorish and Spanish designs. The main altar is totally made from wood. The halls of the head cloister are inlaid with Sevillian glazed tiles dating from the 1620s. The complex is made of the temple, the convent and two other churches, 'La Soledad' and 'El Milagro'.  Convent  The convent's library is world-renowned. It possesses about 25,000 antique texts, some of them predating the conquest. Some notable books are the first Spanish dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy and a Holy Bible edition from 1571- 1572 printed in Antwerp.Library Page of the Official San Francisco Monastery Website Other notable possessions are 13 paintings of the biblical patriarch Jacob and his 12 sons in the refectory, by the hand of the studio of the Spanish master Francisco de Zurbar√°n. The last supper painted by Diego de la Puente depicts typical Peruvian ingredients and meals, instead of European dishes it depicts, such as guinea pig, potatoes and chillis. Also peculiar is the Devil hovering besides Judas. The monastery also possesses several paintings attributed to the school of Peter Paul Rubens. Main courtyard with cloisters The convent originally included seven cloisters (the main courtyard, St. Bonaventure, St. Francis Solanus (who is buried in the monastery church), the Pepper Yard, the Infirmary, the Novitiate and the Third Order). During the works to open Abancay Avenue in the 1940s, part of the monastery (including St. Bonaventure's courtyard) was demolished, and the section used by the Franciscan Third Order was separated from the main structure. Another cloister, that once belonged to the Franciscans, was given to the Society for Public Welfare around 1847 and became part of the Ruiz D√°vila Hospice. Another part of the complex is now used by the Peruvian National Police.  Catacombs  Ossuary in San Francisco catacombs. Catacombs filled with skulls and bones, neatly organised to form geometric figures It is estimated that 25,000 bodies were laid to rest in the catacombs; the crypts, built of bricks and mortar, are very solid and have stood up well to earthquakes. The catacombs served as a burial-place until 1808, when the city cemetery was opened outside Lima and contain thousands of skulls and bones. The catacombs were rediscovered in 1943. It is also believed there existed secret passageways that connected to the Cathedral and the Tribunal of the Holy Inquisition. Bibliography * GUIDE TO PERU, Handbook for travelers, 6th.

These are correlated with sexual permissiveness, status of women, and treatment of children as the principal formative social influences. The musical styles are at the same time symbolic or expressive of such social influences, especially in the various musical communities of Spain and Italy, and are stable, persistent. Lomax states his expectation that further study and refinement of methods of measurement will increase our understanding of the relationships of musical style and culture in a way that Western European musical notation cannot adequately accomplish. Richard Middleton (1990, p. 9-10) argues that \\"such theories always end up in some kind of reductionism ‚Äì 'upwards', into an idealist cultural spirit, 'downwards', into economism, sociologism or technologism, or by 'circumnavigation', in a functionalist holism.\\" However, he \\"would like to hang on to the notion of homology in a qualified sense.

Its California API scores are fourth-highest in the state. Located on the campus of California State University, Dominguez Hills, CAMS shares many facilities with the university, including the gymnasium, the student union, the tennis courts, the pool, the library and many of the parking lots. It is a National \\"No Child Left Behind\\" Blue Ribbon (2011) and California Distinguished school. The No Child Left Behind blue ribbon was only presented to 32 public schools nationwide. Newsweek states in its top 1200 High Schools in the USA, CAMS is in the top 4% taking number 281 in 2006.NEWSWEEK COVER: America's Best High Schools, 2006 In the December 2007, Newsweek released the results of a two-year study to determine the 100 best High Schools in the United States of America. Out of the 18,000+ schools reviewed, CAMS made it into the top 100 as number 21. As of August 24, 2016, CAMS moved up in ranking to the 100th best high school in the nation. In California CAMS is ranked 10th in the state. According to US News and World Report as of November 2019 CAMS is rated as the 46th best high school in the nation, and the 5th best in California. It also ranks as the best magnet high school in California. Unlike similar schools such as the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, CAMS is non-residential, drawing its students solely from most of Long Beach, portions of Los Angeles, and some cities of the South Bay region. Students are admitted only as freshmen. In 2016 the admissions process was changed and is now based only on academic achievement in middle school. The prior interviewing and applications process was discontinued due to a legal settlement. In the past, applicants from different grade levels were allowed to apply and be accepted, but due to the strict, demanding curriculum at CAMS, the school felt incomers from other grade levels would be unable to keep up with the rest of the students, as they would be unaccustomed to such a curriculum. General information The California Academy of Mathematics and Science (CAMS) opened on the California State University at Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) campus in 1990, the product of partnerships among CSUDH, the California State University‚Äôs Chancellor‚Äôs Office, a consortium of eleven local school districts, and high tech and aerospace industries. Long Beach Unified School District serves as the managing school district fiscal agent. Today CAMS ranks in the top ten schools in California on the NCLB Academic Performance Index; its students score well above state and national averages on the math and verbal SATs. Average student daily attendance in 2003-04 was 98%. Attrition is less than 5% for all reasons, as opposed to a 50% drop-out rate in some local high schools, and 95% of CAMS students go on to four-year colleges and universities, including the most selective and prestigious in the nation. (Approximately 5% attend community colleges.) Although CAMS winnows about 175 students from about a thousand of 9th grade applicants each year, CAMS does not rank its applicants for acceptance, but accepts students from each of its 75 feeder schools including predominately inner-city middle schools. Its mission is to ‚Äúdefy the odds‚Äù and prove that students, especially those from academically deprived environments, can excel in math and science, given a setting that features integrated curriculum, teamwork, and real world applications of learning. Faculty refer to CAMS as a ‚Äútalent development program.‚Äù Class size is relatively large, between 30-40 students. The school receives about $5,500 per student annually, placing CAMS is on par with the state average for high schools. (CAMS‚Äôs base funding is $4,400 per student; private donations and special legislative funding make up the rest.) Campus Because CAMS is on the CSUDH campus, juniors and seniors may enroll in university courses (and some CAMS teachers teach at CSUDH). In the past students were able to begin taking courses on CSUDH campus as early as their sophomore year. CAMS students may graduate with as many as 20 college credits‚Äîan advantage for students applying to selective colleges and/or advancing to early college graduation. Many of these students receive generous scholarship awards to help them afford higher education costs. The school oversees numerous internship and summer programs with business partners, matching students with professionals from an industry of the student‚Äôs choice. Mentors from local industries help bridge the gap between the classroom and the ‚Äúreal world,‚Äù inspiring students to think beyond high school. One mentor who is still in contact with students he mentored over the years said, ‚ÄúI am most tough on time management, which I think helped them be successful in their studies.‚Äù History Created in 1990 by Dr. Kathleen Clark, CAMS was originally composed of the Southern Academic Complex (SAC) and was relatively small in comparison to now. About six years ago new buildings were constructed to help accommodate the students population. Now phase II is complete. The last building was finished midway through the 2007-2008 school year. Only CAMS seniors are currently granted access to CSUDH's newly completed student union during lunch hours. Dr. Clark retired at the end of the 2006-2007 school year after having been principal for as long as the graduating class of 2007 had been alive. Dr. Filer, previously vice-principal, became the new principal beginning with the 2007-2008 school year. Dr. Filer retired at the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, and Mr. Brown became the principal. CAMS also has a lot of social activities and clubs to participate in. A few include Robotics, Test Code, Key Club, Society of Women Engineers, Filmmakers Club, Photography Club, Biomed Club, the Tennis team, etc. Notable alumni *Chester Pitts - Seattle Seahawks left guard *Leila Chirayath Janah - Social Entrepreneur, Founder and CEO of Samasource *Myles Williams - Engineer, founder and CEO of Prophets Only *Kun Gao - Entrepreneur, Founder and CEO of CrunchyrollInc Magazine Extracurricular activities Students at CAMS enjoy a variety of extracurricular activities, including Dance Team, Sports, Key Club, PI (Pacific Islander) Club, Chess Club, Math Club, M.E.Ch.A., Computer Science Club, Pinoy Club, Black Student Alliance (BSA), Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA), National Honor Society (NHS), Future Medical Professionals, Associated Student Body (ASB), Rocket Team, MATE Underwater ROV Competition (ROV) Team, National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement), FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team, VEX Robotics Team, Girls Build LA, and HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America). FRC, Vex Robotics, ROV, NSBE, and Rocket Team allow students to apply what they have learned in math, science, and engineering to create a product worthy of competition. MESA and the Robotics Program (FRC, VEX, and ROV) are the largest organizations at CAMS whose main focus is math and science. Students may also join HOSA, which has recently started in conjunction with the new Biotechnology pathway at CAMS. Students in the CAMS HOSA team may compete in multiple medical science categories such as medical terminology, medical math, biomedical debates, etc. at the State and National level. Since students are allowed membership in the VEX Robotics program beginning their sophomore year, most tend to join the robotics team that year. It is very challenging to actively participate in all three programs. The Girls Build LA team at CAMS, which works to improve the community, has been awarded grant funding by the LA Promise Fund every year since 2017. Athletics California Academy of Math & Science beat Animo 2-1 in a CIF Southern Section Division VII semifinal on 3/3/2010 at Beckham Field at the Home Depot Center. After its third Delphic League Championship in a row under 4th-year Head Coach Jim Watwood (2010 LB Press Telegram Coach of the year) and reaching a semifinal last year, top seed CAMS (17-2-1) advanced to its first CIF final, where it faced No. 2 seed Sierra Vista. In the last seconds of the game, Sierra Vista scored on a controversial cross to tie the game 1-1. The Royals went on to lose in penalty kicks 5-4. It marked the first CIF final for CAMS soccer and the school's second CIF team title game. The CAMS girls tennis team won the school's first CIF team title in 2006.

This attack became the pretext for the government of Hungary to declare war on the Soviet Union the next day, 27 June. On 26 June 1941, four days after Germany attacked the Soviet Union in violation of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop non-aggression treaty as a part of Operation Barbarossa, three unidentified planes bombed the city, killing and wounding over a dozen people and causing minor material damage. Numerous buildings were hit, including the local post and telegraph office. Hours after the attack, the Hungarian cabinet \\"passed a resolution calling for the declaration of the existence of a state of war between Hungary and the USSR.\\" The local military investigators at the time believed that the attackers were Soviet, but the true identity of the attacking nation has never been established. The official explanation preferred by Soviet historians was the idea of a feigned attack by Germany to provoke Hungary into attacking the Soviet Union, employing Soviet planes captured on conquered airfields. Another possibility is that the Soviet bombers mistook Kassa for a nearby city in the First Slovak Republic, which was already at war with the Soviet Union. Captain √Åd√°m Kr√∫dy, the commander of the Kassa military airfield, identified the attackers as German Heinkel He 111 bombers in his official report but was ordered to keep silent about it. Another problem with the German conspiracy theory was the fact that German planes did not have bomb-racks capable of holding Soviet bombs. According to Dreisziger, \\"it seems that the bombs dropped on Kassa were 100 kg bombs while the standard stock of the Luftwaffe were the 50 and 250 kg bombs.\\" During the Nuremberg trials, the USSR brought forth a statement allegedly taken from Hungarian Major General Istv√°n √öjsz√°szy. According to the testimony, \\"the Kassa 'plot' was hatched by German and Hungarian officers and carried out by 'German planes with Russian markings'.\\" This theory was introduced because he found that, following the Kassa bombings, certain officers behaved suspiciously, not due to concrete evidence. The reliability of his testimony less valued due to the nature of his interrogation, which may have been under duress. In his memoirs, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, Hungary's head of state in the interwar period, stated that Hungary's entry into World War II had been provoked by the \\"staged\\" bombing of Kassa carried out by German pilots. He also accused General Henrik Werth, the Hungarian Chief of Staff of being a part of the conspiracy. In 1942, a report was made that a Hungarian officer, billeted in a house in a town of occupied Soviet Union, learned that an earlier occupant of his room had been one Andrej Andele, a Czech-born pilot of the Soviet Air Force, who had openly admitted his part in the raid on Kassa. This theory was shut down as well, due to the fact that the aircraft that bombed Kassa were twin-engined monoplanes. The Soviet Air Force did not have this kind of aircraft, but had biplanes. With this knowledge, the type of craft used in this attack could only be taken from the Germans. Another factor that breaks down this theory was the timing of the attacks. The westernmost town Kassa was reportedly attacked around shortly after 1 P.M. According to evidence brought by the Soviets at Nuremberg, the easternmost town was raided around 12:30 P.M. This evidence proved that the attack came from the east, from Soviet Union, rather than Slovakia from the west. According to modern historians Iv√°n Pataki, L√°szl√≥ Rozsos and Gyula S√°rhidai, Soviet aircraft attacked the city by mistake while targeting a German radio station in the city of Pre≈°ov (Eperjes), Slovakia, about 30 kilometres north of Kassa. All three bombers aimed at the post office building which had a large radio antenna on its roof. After releasing a total of 29 bombs, one of the planes dropped a single bomb outside the city which did not explode; it was recovered and identified as a 105 kg Soviet bomb. According to this explanation, Kr√∫dy misidentified three Soviet TB-3 bombers as German He 111s, but the suggestion that this identification was \\"hushed up\\" represented post-war Communist propaganda.

At its height in 1919‚Äì1920, concerns over the effects of radical political agitation in American society and the alleged spread of communism and anarchism in the American labor movement fueled a general sense of concern. The Scare had its origins in the hyper-nationalism of World War I as well as the Russian Revolution. At the war's end, following the October Revolution, American authorities saw the threat of communist revolution in the actions of organized labor, including such disparate cases as the Seattle General Strike and the Boston Police Strike and then in the bombing campaign directed by anarchist groups at political and business leaders. Fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings, and then spurred on by the Palmer Raids and attempts by United States Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to suppress radical organizations, it was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric, illegal search and seizures, unwarranted arrests and detentions, and the deportation of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists. In addition, the growing anti-immigration nativist movement among Americans viewed increasing immigration from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe as a threat to American political and social stability. Bolshevism and the threat of a communist- inspired revolution in the U.S. became the overriding explanation for challenges to the social order, even for such largely unrelated events as incidents of interracial violence during the Red Summer of 1919. Fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in form of display of certain flags and banners. In April 1920, concerns peaked with J. Edgar Hoover telling the nation to prepare for a bloody uprising on May Day. Police and militias prepared for the worst, but May Day passed without incident. Soon, public opinion and the courts turned against Palmer, putting an end to his raids and the First Red Scare. Origins The First Red Scare's immediate cause was the increase in subversive actions of foreign and leftist elements in the United States, especially militant followers of Luigi Galleani, and in the attempts of the U.S. government to quell protest and gain favorable public views of America's entering World War I. At the end of the 19th century and prior to the rise of the Galleanist anarchist movement, the Haymarket affair of 1886 had already heightened the American public's fear of foreign anarchist and radical socialist elements within the budding American workers' movement. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson established the Committee on Public Information to circulate and distribute anti-German and pro-Allied propaganda and other news. To add to the effectiveness of the Committee, the Bureau of Investigation (the name for the Federal Bureau of Investigation until 1935) disrupted the work of German-American, union, and leftist organizations through the use of raids, arrests, agents provocateurs, and legal prosecution. Revolutionary and pacifist groups, such as the Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW; its members are known as Wobblies), strongly opposed the war. Many leaders of these groups, most notably Eugene V. Debs, were prosecuted for giving speeches urging resistance to the draft. Members of the Ghadar Party were also put on trial in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial. The effort was also helped by the United States Congress, with the passing of the Espionage Act in 1917, the Sedition Act of 1918, and the Immigration Act of 1918. The Espionage Act made it a crime to interfere with the operation or success of the military, and the Sedition Act forbade Americans to use \\"disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language\\" about the United States government, flag, or armed forces of the United States during war.Laws of the United States, Espionage Act of 1917 (Act of June 15, 1917), ch. 30, title I, ¬ß3, 40 Stat. 219, amended by Act of May 16, 1918, ch. 75, 40 Stat. 553-54, reenacted by Act of Mar. 3, 1921, ch. 136, 41 Stat. 1359, (codified at 18 U.S.C. ¬ß2388); Laws of the United States, Sedition Act of 1918, (1918 Amendments to ¬ß3 of The Espionage Act of 1917), Act of May 16, 1918, ch. 75, 40 Stat. 553-54, (repealed by Act of Mar. 3, 1921, ch. 136, 41 Stat. 1359) The Immigration Act of 1918 targeted anarchists by name and was used to deport Emma Goldman and Luigi Galleani, among others.Ann Hagedorn, Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919 (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007), pp. 184‚Äì5, 218‚Äì22 After the war officially ended, the government investigations abated for a few months but did not cease. They soon resumed in the context of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and the Red Terror. To some Americans, this was a time of uncertainty and fear over the prospects of an anarchist, socialist or communist revolution in the United States.  Progression of events =Seattle General Strike= Seattle General Strike of 1919, the nation's first general strike On January 21, 1919, 35,000 shipyard workers in Seattle went on strike seeking wage increases. They appealed to the Seattle Central Labor Council for support from other unions and found widespread enthusiasm. Within two weeks, more than 100 local unions joined in a call on February 3 for general strike to begin on the morning of February 6.Murray, 58‚Äì60; Brecher, 121 The 60,000 total strikers paralyzed the city's normal activities, like streetcar service, schools, and ordinary commerce, while their General Strike Committee maintained order and provided essential services, like trash collection and milk deliveries.Hagedorn, 87; Brecher, 122-4 Even before the strike began, the press begged the unions to reconsider. In part they were frightened by some of labor's rhetoric, like the labor newspaper editorial that proclaimed: \\"We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country ... We are starting on a road that leads ‚Äì NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!\\"Brecher, 124-5 Daily newspapers saw the general strike as a foreign import: \\"This is America ‚Äì not Russia,\\" one said when denouncing the general strike.Murray, 60-1 The non-striking part of Seattle's population imagined the worst and stocked up on food. Hardware stores sold their stock of guns.Murray, 60-2 Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson announced that he had 1500 police and 1500 federal troops on hand to put down any disturbances. He personally oversaw their deployment throughout the city.Murray, 63 \\"The time has come,\\" he said, \\"for the people in Seattle to show their Americanism ... The anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs.\\" He promised to use them to replace striking workers, but never carried out that threat.Brecher, 126-7 Meanwhile the national leadership of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and international leaders of some of the Seattle locals recognized how inflammatory the general strike was proving in the eyes of the American public and Seattle's middle class. Press and political reaction made the general strike untenable, and they feared Seattle labor would lose gains made during the war if it continued.Brecher, 127-8; Murray, 64 The national press called the general strike \\"Marxian\\" and \\"a revolutionary movement aimed at existing government.\\"Murray, 65 \\"It is only a middling step,\\" said the Chicago Tribune, \\"from Petrograd to Seattle.\\"Murray 65 As early as February 8 some unions began to return to work at the urging of their leaders. Some workers went back to work as individuals, perhaps fearful of losing their jobs if the Mayor acted on his threats or in reaction to the pressure of life under the general strike.Foner, 75 The executive committee of the General Strike Committee first recommended ending the general strike on February 8 but lost that vote. Finally on February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the strike the next day.Foner, 75-6 The original strike in the shipyards continued.Brecher, 128 Though the general strike collapsed because labor leadership viewed it as a misguided tactic from the start, Mayor Hanson took credit for ending the five-day strike and was hailed by the press. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of \\"domestic bolshevism.\\" He earned $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor.Murray, 65-6; Hagedorn, 180 He published a pamphlet called Americanism versus Bolshevism.Foner, 77n; Noggle, 102-3; Ole Hanson, Americanism versus Bolshevism (Garden City, NY, 1920), Americanism versus Bolshevism, accessed April 11, 2011 =Overman Committee= The New York Times, June 15, 1919New York Times: \\"Senators Tell What Bolshevism in America Means,\\" June 15, 1919.

First charged with investigating German subversion during World War I, its mandate was extended on February 4, 1919, just a day after the announcement of the Seattle General Strike, to study \\"any efforts being made to propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia\\" and \\"any effort to incite the overthrow of the Government of this country.\\"United States Congress, Bolshevik Propaganda, 6; Hagedorn, 55; Murray, 94; New York Times: \\"Senate Orders Reds Here Investigated,\\", February 5, 1919.

The Committee's hearings into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted from February 11 to March 10, 1919, developed an alarming image of Bolshevism as an imminent threat to the U.S. government and American values. The Committee's final report appeared in June 1919. Archibald E. Stevenson, a New York attorney with ties to the Justice Department, probably as a \\"volunteer spy\\",Hagedorn, 54, 58 testified on January 22, 1919, during the German phase of the subcommittee's work.

April 1919 mail bombs Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer's house with bomb damage In late April 1919, approximately 36 booby trap bombs were mailed to prominent politicians, including the Attorney General of the United States, judges, businessmen (including John D. Rockefeller),\\"Send Death Bombs to 36 U.S. Leaders\\" Chicago Tribune, May 1, 1919 and a Bureau of Investigation field agent, R.W. Finch, who happened to be investigating the Galleanist organization.The Galleanists were radical anarchists and devotees of Luigi Galleani who advocated 'direct action', i.e. bombing and assassination, against capitalists and representatives of the government.Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 147: The inclusion of R.W. Finch, a low-ranking BOI agent who had been assigned to question and investigate the Galleanist movement and had questioned other Galleanists about movements of its members, dispelled any doubt on the identity of the bombers. The bombs were mailed in identical packages and were timed to arrive on May Day, the day of celebration of organized labor and the working class.Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, Princeton University Press (1991), p. 142 A few of the packages went undelivered because they lacked sufficient postage.Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, p. 141 One bomb intended for Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson, who had opposed the Seattle General Strike, arrived early and failed to explode as intended. Seattle police in turn notified the Post Office and other police agencies. On April 29, a package sent to U.S. Senator Thomas W. Hardwick of Georgia, a sponsor of the Anarchist Exclusion Act, exploded injuring his wife and housekeeper. On April 30, a post office employee in New York City recognized 16 packages by their wrapping and interrupted their delivery. Another twelve bombs were recovered before reaching their targets. June 1919 bombs In June 1919, eight bombs, far larger than those mailed in April, exploded almost simultaneously in several U.S. cities. These new bombs were believed to contain up to twenty-five pounds of dynamite,Plotter Here Hid Trail Skillfully; His Victim Was A Night Watchman, The New York Times, June 4, 1919Wreck Judge Nott's Home, The New York Times, June 3, 1919 and all were wrapped or packaged with heavy metal slugs designed to act as shrapnel.20 Pounds of Dynamite In Bomb Used in New York,, The Washington Post, June 4, 1919 All of the intended targets had participated in some way with the investigation of or the opposition to anarchist radicals. Along with Attorney General Palmer, who was targeted a second time, the intended victims included a Massachusetts state representative and a New Jersey silk manufacturer. Fatalities included a New York City night watchman, William Boehner, and one of the bombers, Carlo Valdinoci, a Galleanist radical who died in spectacular fashion when the bomb he placed at the home of Attorney General Palmer exploded in his face.Avrich, Paul, Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America (AK Press, 2005) , , p. 496 Though not seriously injured, Attorney General Palmer and his family were thoroughly shaken by the blast, and their home was largely demolished.Avrich, p. 153 All of the bombs were delivered with pink flyers bearing the title \\"Plain Words\\" that accused the intended victims of waging class war and promised: \\"We will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions.\\"Avrich, 149 Police and the Bureau of Investigation tracked the flyer to a print shop owned by an anarchist, Andrea Salcedo, but never obtained sufficient evidence for a prosecution. Evidence from Valdonoci's death, bomb components, and accounts from participants later tied both bomb attacks to the Galleanists.Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 168‚Äì183 Though some of the Galleanists were deported or left the country voluntarily, attacks by remaining members continued until 1932.Avrich, Paul, Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America (AK Press, 2005) , , pp. 132, 501 =May Day 1919= The American labor movement had been celebrating its May Day holiday since the 1890s and had seen none of the violence associated with the day's events in Europe.Murray, 74 On May 1, 1919, the left mounted especially large demonstrations, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland. In Boston, police tried to stop a march that lacked a permit. In the ensuing melee both sides fought for possession of the Socialists' red flags. One policeman was stabbed and killed. William Sidis was arrested. Later a mob attacked the Socialist headquarters. Police arrested 114, all from the Socialist side. Each side's newspapers provided uncritical support to their own the next day. In New York, soldiers in uniform burned printed materials at the Russian People's House and forced immigrants to sing the Star-Spangled Banner.Hagedorn, 185-6; Murray, 75 Cleveland, Ohio saw the worst violence. Leftists protesting the imprisonment of Eugene V. Debs and promoting the campaign of Charles Ruthenberg, the Socialist candidate for mayor, planned to march through the center of the city. A group of Victory Loan workers, a nationalist organization whose members sold war bonds and thought themselves still at war against all forms of anti-Americanism, tried to block some of the marchers and a melee ensued. A mob ransacked Ruthenberg's headquarters. Mounted police, army trucks, and tanks restored order. Two people died, forty were injured, and 116 arrested. Local newspapers noted that only 8 of those arrested were born in the United States. The city government immediately passed laws to restrict parades and the display of red flags.Hagedorn, 185-6; Murray 75-5 With few dissents, newspapers blamed the May Day marchers for provoking the nationalists' response. The Salt Lake City Tribune did not think anyone had a right to march. It said: \\"Free speech has been carried to the point where it is an unrestrained menace.\\"Hagedorn, 185-6 A few, however, thought the marches were harmless and that the marchers' enthusiasm would die down on its own if they were left unmolested.Murray, 77 =Race riots= More than two dozen American communities, mostly urban areas or industrial centers, saw racial violence in the summer and early fall of 1919. Unlike earlier race riots in U.S. history, the 1919 riots were among the first in which blacks responded with resistance to the white attacks. Martial law was imposed in Charleston, South Carolina,New York Times: \\"For Action on Race Riot Peril,\\" October 5, 1919, accessed January 20, 2010. This newspaper article includes several paragraphs of editorial analysis followed by Dr. Haynes' report, \\"summarized at several points.\\" where men of the U.S. Navy led a race riot on May 10.

A Naval investigation found that four U.S. sailors and one civilian‚Äîall white men‚Äîwere responsible for the outbreak of violence.Walter C. Rucker, James N. Upton. Encyclopedia of American Race Riots. Volume 1. 2007, page 92‚Äì3. On July 3, the 10th U.S. Cavalry, a segregated African-American unit founded in 1866, was attacked by local police in Bisbee, Arizona.Rucker, Walter C. and Upton, James N. Encyclopedia of American Race Riots (2007), 554. A white gang looking for African Americans during the Chicago race riot of 1919 Two of the most violent episodes occurred in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. In Washington, D.C., white men, many in military uniforms, responded to the rumored arrest of a black man for rape with four days of mob violence, rioting and beatings of random black people on the street. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. When the violence ended, ten whites were dead, including two police officers, and 5 blacks. Some 150 people had been the victims of attacks.Ackerman, 60‚Äì2. The rioting in Chicago started on July 27. Chicago's beaches along Lake Michigan were segregated in practice, if not by law. A black youth who drifted into the area customarily reserved for whites was stoned and drowned. Blacks responded violently when the police refused to take action. Violence between mobs and gangs lasted 13 days. The resulting 38 fatalities included 23 blacks and 15 whites. Injuries numbered 537 injured, and 1,000 black families were left homeless.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Chicago Race Riot of 1919\\". Retrieved January 24, 2010. Some 50 people were reported dead. Unofficial numbers were much higher. Hundreds of mostly black homes and businesses on the South Side were destroyed by mobs, and a militia force of several thousand was called in to restore order. In mid-summer, in the middle of the Chicago riots, a \\"federal official\\" told the New York Times that the violence resulted from \\"an agitation, which involves the I.W.W., Bolshevism and the worst features of other extreme radical movements.\\" He supported that claim with copies of negro publications that called for alliances with leftist groups, praised the Soviet regime, and contrasted the courage of jailed Socialist Eugene V. Debs with the \\"school boy rhetoric\\" of traditional black leaders. The Times characterized the publications as \\"vicious and apparently well financed,\\" mentioned \\"certain factions of the radical Socialist elements,\\" and reported it all under the headline: \\"Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt.\\"New York Times: \\"Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt,\\", January 28, 1919.

During the strike, Boston experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm out of proportion to the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.Foner, 96 The strikers were called \\"deserters\\" and \\"agents of Lenin.\\"Murray, 126 The Philadelphia Public Ledger viewed the Boston violence in the same light as many other of 1919's events: \\"Bolshevism in the United States is no longer a specter. Boston in chaos reveals its sinister substance.\\"Murray, 129; Foner, 96-7 President Woodrow Wilson, speaking from Montana, branded the walkout \\"a crime against civilization\\" that left the city \\"at the mercy of an army of thugs.\\"Pietrusza, 99 The timing of the strike also happened to present the police union in the worst light. September 10, the first full day of the strike, was also the day a huge New York City parade celebrated the return of Gen. John J. Pershing, the hero of the American Expeditionary Force.Hagedorn, 351-2 A report from Washington, D.C. included this headline: \\"Senators Think Effort to Sovietize the Government Is Started.\\"Murray, 130 Senator Henry Cabot Lodge saw in the strike the dangers of the national labor movement: \\"If the American Federation of Labor succeeds in getting hold of the police in Boston it will go all over the country, and we shall be in measurable distance of Soviet government by labor unions.\\"Foner, 97 The Ohio State Journal opposed any sympathetic treatment of the strikers: \\"When a policeman strikes, he should be debarred not only from resuming his office, but from citizenship as well. He has committed the unpardonable sin; he has forfeited all his rights.\\"Murray, 132 Samuel Gompers of the AFL recognized that the strike was damaging labor in the public mind and advised the strikers to return to work. The Police Commissioner, however, remained adamant and refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. Famous as a man of few words, he put the anti-union position simply: \\"There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime.\\"Pietrusza, 100; Foner, 100. See also New York Times: \\"Bay State Governor Firm,\\", September 15, 1919. Retrieved February 5, 1919. The strike proved another setback for labor and the AFL immediately withdrew its recognition of police unions. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for Vice-President in the 1920 presidential election in part due to his actions during the Boston Police Strike.  Steel strike of 1919  \\"Coming out of the Smoke\\", New York World, October 11, 1919 Though the leadership of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) opposed a strike in the steel industry, 98% of their union members voted to strike beginning on September 22, 1919. It shut down half the steel industry, including almost all mills in Pueblo, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; Wheeling, West Virginia; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; Lackawanna, New York; and Youngstown, Ohio.Brody, 233-44 The owners quickly turned public opinion against the AFL. As the strike began, they published information exposing AFL National Committee co-chairman William Z. Foster's radical past as a Wobbly and syndicalist, and claimed this was evidence that the steelworker strike was being masterminded by radicals and revolutionaries. The steel companies played on nativist fears by noting that a large number of steelworkers were immigrants. Public opinion quickly turned against the striking workers. State and local authorities backed the steel companies. They prohibited mass meetings, had their police attack pickets and jailed thousands. After strikebreakers and police clashed with unionists in Gary, Indiana, the U.S. Army took over the city on October 6, 1919, and martial law was declared. National Guardsmen, leaving Gary after federal troops had taken over, turned their anger on strikers in nearby Indiana Harbor, Indiana.Rayback, 287; Brody, 244‚Äì253; Dubofsky and Dulles, 220 Steel companies also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to demoralize the picketers. They brought in between 30,000 and 40,000 African-American and Mexican-American workers to work in the mills. Company spies also spread rumors that the strike had collapsed elsewhere, and they pointed to the operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.Rayback, 287; Dubofsky and Dulles, 220-21; Brody, 254-55 Congress conducted its own investigation, focused on radical influence upon union activity. In that context, U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar, a member of the Senate committee investigating the strike, proposed making one of the Philippine Islands a penal colony to which those convicted of an attempt to overthrow the government could be deported.New York Times: \\"Bill Provides Penal Colony in Philippines for Anarchists,\\", October 25, 1919. Retrieved January 31, 2010. The Chicago mills gave in at the end of October. By the end of November, workers were back at their jobs in Gary, Johnstown, Youngstown, and Wheeling. The strike collapsed on January 8, 1920, though it dragged on in isolated areas like Pueblo and Lackawanna.Brody, 258-62 Coal strike of 1919 The United Mine Workers under John L. Lewis announced a strike for November 1, 1919.Coben, 176-8 They had agreed to a wage agreement to run until the end of World War I and now sought to capture some of their industry's wartime gains. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer invoked the Lever Act, a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities. The law, meant to punish hoarding and profiteering, had never been used against a union. Certain of united political backing and almost universal public support, Palmer obtained an injunction on October 31New York Times: \\"Palmer to Enforce Law,\\", November 1, 1919. Retrieved January 26, 2010. and 400,000 coal workers struck the next day.Coben, 178-9 He claimed the President authorized the action, following a meeting with the severely ill President in the presence of his doctor.Coben, 178-9. On the President's role, see also Kenneth D. Ackerman, Young J. Edgar: Hoover, the Red Scare, and the Assault on Civil Liberties (New York: Carroll & Graf, 2007), 100 Palmer also asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor Wilson who had opposed Palmer's plan and supported Gompers' view of the President's promises when the Act was under consideration. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer's attempts to deport radicals were frustrated by the Department of Labor.Josephus Daniels, The Wilson Era: Years of War and After, 1917‚Äì1923 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1946), 546‚Äì7 Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor, protested that President Wilson and members of his Cabinet had provided assurances when the Act was passed that it would not be used to prevent strikes by labor unions. He provided detailed accounts of his negotiations with representatives of the administration, especially Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson. He also argued that the end of hostilities, even in the absence of a signed treaty, should have invalidated any attempts to enforce the Act's provisions.New York Times: \\"Gompers Repeats Injunction Charge,\\".

Nevertheless, he attempted to mediate between Palmer and Lewis, but after several days called the injunction \\"so autocratic as to stagger the human mind.\\"Coben, 179-80 The coal operators smeared the strikers with charges that Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press echoed that language.Murray, 155 Others used words like \\"insurrection\\" and \\"Bolshevik revolution.\\" Eventually Lewis, facing criminal charges and sensitive to the propaganda campaign, withdrew his strike call, though many strikers ignored his action.Coben, 181 As the strike dragged on into its third week, coal supplies were running low and public sentiment was calling for ever stronger government action. Final agreement came on December 10.Coben, 181-3; New York Times: \\"Miners Finally Agree,\\" , December 11, 1919.

Mitchell Palmer moved slowly to find a way to attack the source of the violence. An initial raid in July 1919 against a small anarchist group in Buffalo failed when a federal judge tossed out his case.Pietruszka, 146-7 In August, he organized the General Intelligence Division within the Department of Justice and recruited J. Edgar Hoover, a recent law school graduate, to head it.Pietruszka, 146 Hoover pored over arrest records, subscription records of radical newspapers, and party membership records to compile lists of resident aliens for deportation proceedings. On October 17, 1919, just a year after the Immigration Act of 1918 had expanded the definition of aliens that could be deported, the U.S. Senate demanded Palmer explain his failure to move against radicals.Coben, 176 Palmer launched his campaign against radicalism with two sets of police actions known as the Palmer Raids in November 1919 and January 1920. Federal agents supported by local police rounded up large groups of suspected radicals, often based on membership in a political group rather than any action taken. Undercover informants and warrantless wiretaps (authorized under the Sedition Act) helped to identify several thousand suspected leftists and radicals to be arrested. Only the dismissal of most of the cases by Acting United States Secretary of Labor Louis Freeland Post limited the number of deportations to 556. Fearful of extremist violence and revolution, the American public supported the raids. Civil libertarians, the radical left, and legal scholars raised protests. Officials at the Department of Labor, especially Post, asserted the rule of law in opposition to Palmer's anti-radical campaign. Post faced a Congressional threat to impeach or censure him. He successfully defended his actions in two days of testimony before the House Rules Committee in June 1919 and no action was ever taken against him. Palmer testified before the same committee, also for two days, and stood by the raids, arrests, and deportation program. Much of the press applauded Post's work at Labor, while Palmer, rather than President Wilson, was largely blamed for the negative aspects of the raids. Deportations Reds\\" as America's Christmas present to Lenine [sic] and Trotzky [sic].\\" On December 21, 1919, the Buford, a ship the press nicknamed the \\"Soviet Ark\\", left New York harbor with 249 deportees. Of those, 199 had been detained in the November Palmer Raids, with 184 of them deported because of their membership in the Union of Russian Workers, an anarchist group that was a primary target of the November raids. Others on board, including the well-known radical leaders Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, had not been taken in the Palmer Raids. Goldman had been convicted in 1893 of \\"inciting to riot\\" and arrested on many other occasions.

Sweet attacked the Assembly's five Socialist members, declaring they had been \\"elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the best interests of the state of New York and the United States.\\" The Socialist Party, Sweet said, was \\"not truly a political party,\\" but was rather \\"a membership organization admitting within its ranks aliens, enemy aliens, and minors.\\" It had supported the revolutionaries in Germany, Austria, and Hungary, he continued, and consorted with international Socialist parties close to the Communist International.Waldman, 2‚Äì7 The Assembly suspended the five by a vote of 140 to 6, with just one Democrat supporting the Socialists. A trial in the Assembly, lasting from January 20 to March 11, resulted in a recommendation that the five be expelled and the Assembly voted overwhelmingly for expulsion on April 1, 1920. Opposition to the Assembly's actions was widespread and crossed party lines. From the start of the process, former Republican Governor, Supreme Court Justice, and presidential candidate Charles Evans Hughes defended the Socialist members: \\"Nothing ... is a more serious mistake at this critical time than to deprive Socialists or radicals of their opportunities for peaceful discussion and thus to convince them that the Reds are right and that violence and revolution are the only available means at their command.\\"New York Times: \\"Hughes Upholds Socialists' Rights\\", January 10, 1920.

Coverage =Newspaper coverage= Red \\"Bible\\", a variation on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, published in the Public Ledger, Philadelphia, October 27, 1919, by Carl W. Ackerman America's newspapers continually reinforced their readers' pro-American views and presented a negative attitude toward the Soviet Union and communism. They presented a threat of imminent conflict with the Soviet Union that would be justified by the clash with American ideals and goals.Kriesberg, Martin. \\"Soviet News in the 'New York Times'\\". The Public Opinion Quarterly, Vol. 10. (Winter, 1946‚Äì1947): 540‚Äì564. JSTOR. 23 Oct. 2014. In addition, when The New York Times reported positively about the Soviet Union, it received less attention from the public than when it reported antagonistically about it. This did not hold true when Soviet interests agreed with American ones. As a result of this, the Times had a tendency to use exaggerated headlines, weighted words, and questionable sources in order to create a negative slant against the Soviets and communism. The tendency was to be very pro-American and theatrical in their coverage. The Red Scare led to the Western popularization of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The text was purportedly brought to the United States by a Russian army officer in 1917; it was translated into English by Natalie de Bogory (personal assistant of Harris A. Houghton, an officer of the Department of War) in June 1918,Baldwin, N. Henry Ford and the Jews. The mass production of hate. PublicAffair (2001), p. 82. . and White Russian expatriate Boris Brasol soon circulated it in American government circles, specifically diplomatic and military, in typescript form,Wallace, M. The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich. St. Martin's Press (2003), p. 60. . It also appeared in 1919 in the Public Ledger as a pair of serialized newspaper articles. But all references to \\"Jews\\" were replaced with references to Bolsheviki as an expos√© by the journalist‚Äîand subsequently highly respected Columbia University School of Journalism dean‚ÄîCarl W. Ackerman. Shortly thereafter it was adapted as \\"The International Jew\\" series in The Dearborn Independent, establishing the myth of Jewish Bolshevism. =Film= America's film industry reflected and exploited every aspect of the public's fascination with and fear of Bolshevism. The German Curse in Russia dramatized the German instigation of Russia's October Revolution.Hanson, 317 The Soviet nationalization of women was central to the plot of The New Moon, in which women between the ages of 23 and 32 are the property of the state and the heroine, Norma Talmadge, is a Russian princess posing as a peasant during the Russian Revolution.Hagedorn, 179; Hanson, 657 Similarly, in The World and Its Woman starring Geraldine Farrar, the daughter of an American engineer working in Russia becomes an opera star and has to fend off attempts to \\"nationalize\\" her.Hanson, 1069 Several films used labor troubles as their setting, with an idealistic American hero and heroine struggling to outwit manipulative left- wing agitators.Virtuous Men, Hanson, 990; The Face at Your Window, Hanson, 257; Uncharted Channels, Hanson, 963‚Äì4In one interesting reversal of the usual plot elements, in Wolves of the Street Wall street profiteers foment a Bolshevik strike to ruin a competitor, the film's hero. Hanson, 1052‚Äì3 Dangerous Hours tells the story of an attempted Russian infiltration of American industry.Its working title was Americanism (Versus Bolshevism), Hanson, 187, the title of a pamphlet by Ole Hanson, the mayor of Seattle who claimed to have broken the Seattle General Strike in 1919. College graduate John King is sympathetic to the left in a general way. Then he is seduced, both romantically and politically, by Sophia Guerni, a female agitator. Her superior is the Bolshevik Boris Blotchi, who has a \\"wild dream of planting the scarlet seed of terrorism in American soil.\\"Brownlow, 263 Sofia and Boris turn their attention to the Weston shipyards that are managed by John's childhood sweetheart, May. The workers have valid grievances, but the Bolsheviks set out to manipulate the situation. They are \\"the dangerous element following in the wake of labor as riffraff and ghouls follow an army.\\" When they threaten May, John has an epiphany and renounces revolutionary doctrine.Brownlow, 263; Hanson, 187 A reviewer in Picture Play protested the film's stew of radical beliefs and strategies: \\"Please, oh please, look up the meaning of the words 'bolshevik' and 'soviet.' Neither of them mean 'anarchist,' 'scoundrel' or 'murderer' ‚Äì really they don't!\\"Brownlow, 264 Some films just used Bolsheviks for comic relief, where they are easily seduced (The Perfect Woman)Hanson, 711 or easily inebriated (Help Yourself).Hanson, 386 In Bullin the Bullsehviks an American named Lotta Nerve outwits Trotsky. New York State Senator Clayton R. Lusk spoke at the film's New York premiere in October 1919.Hanson, 110 Other films used one feature or another of radical philosophy as the key plot point: anarchist violence (The Burning Question),Hanson, 112 assassination and devotion to the red flag (The Volcano),Hanson, 994. The film had a special showing for government officials and political leaders at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 1919 several weeks in advance of its release. utopian vision (Bolshevism on Trial).Hanson, 86 The advertising for Bolshevism on Trial called it \\"the timeliest picture ever filmed\\" and reviews were good. \\"Powerful, well-knit with indubitably true and biting satire,\\" said Photoplay.Hagedorn, 178 As a promotion device, the April 15, 1919, issue of Moving Picture World suggested staging a mock radical demonstration by hanging red flags around town and then have actors in military uniforms storm in to tear them down. The promoter was then to distribute handbills to the confused and curious crowds to reassure them that Bolshevism on Trial takes a stand against Bolshevism and \\"you will not only clean up but will profit by future business.\\"Hagedorn, 175, 180 When this publicity technique came to the attention of U.S. Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson, he expressed his dismay to the press: \\"This publication proposes by deceptive methods of advertising to stir every community in the United States into riotous demonstrations for the purpose of making profits for the moving picture business ...\\" He hoped to ban movies treating Bolshevism and Socialism.Hagedorn, 180Other films were When Doctors Disagree, Hanson, 1017, The Great Shadow, Hanson, 351, and two films for which prints do not survive: Everybody's Business, Hanson, 249, and Give and Take, Hanson, 333 Legislation In 1919 Kansas enacted a law titled \\"An act relating to the flag, standard or banner of Bolshevism, anarchy or radical socialism\\" in an attempt to punish the display of the most common symbol of radicalism, the red flag. Only Massachusetts (1913) and Rhode Island (1914) passed such \\"red flag laws\\" earlier. By 1920 they were joined by 24 more states.Franklin, 292 Some banned certain colors (red or black), or certain expressions (\\"indicating disloyalty or belief in anarchy\\" or \\"antagonistic to the existing government of the United States\\"), or certain contexts (\\"to overthrow the government by general strike\\"), or insignia (\\"flag or emblem or sign\\").Franklin, 292-3; Noggle, 107; Nelles, 3 The Yale Law Journal mocked the Connecticut law against symbols \\"calculated to ... incite people to disorder,\\" anticipating its enforcement at the next Harvard-Yale football game. Ohio exempted college pennants and Wisconsin made an exception for historical museums.Franklin, 293 Minnesota allowed red flags for railroad and highway warnings.Nelles, 3 Setting patriotic standards, red flag laws regulated the proper display of the American flag: above all other flags, ahead of all other banners in any parade, or flown only in association with state flags or the flags of friendly nations.Franklin, 291 Punishment generally included fines from $1,000 to $5,000 and prison terms of 5 to 10 years, occasionally more.Franklin, 294. On red flag laws generally, see Chafee, 180ff. At the federal level, the Espionage Act of 1917 and the amendments to it in the Sedition Act of 1918 prohibited interference with the war effort, including many expressions of opinion. With that legislation rendered inoperative by the end of World War I, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, supported by President Wilson,Kennedy, 87 waged a public campaign in favor of a peacetime version of the Sedition Act without success.Chafee, 195New York Times: \\"Palmer for Stringent Law,\\" November 16, 1919. Retrieved February 12, 2010. He sent a circular outlining his rationale to newspaper editors in January 1919, citing the dangerous foreign-language press and radical attempts to create unrest in African American communities.Chafee, 195-6 At one point Congress had more than 70 versions of proposed language and amendments for such a bill,Chafee, 197 but it took no action on the controversial proposal during the campaign year of 1920.Nelles, 2 Palmer called for every state to enact its own version of the Sedition Act. Six states had laws of this sort before 1919 usually aimed at sabotage, but another 20 added them in 1919 and 1920. Usually called \\"anti- syndicalist laws,\\" they varied in their language, but generally made it a crime to \\"destroy organized government\\" by one method or another, including \\"by the general cessation of industry,\\" that is, through a general strike.Franklin, 294-6; Chafe, 187ff. The authoritative study of this subject is Elbridge Foster Dowell, History of Criminal Syndicalist Legislation (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1939) Many cities had their own versions of these laws, including 20 in the state of Washington alone.Nelles, 3‚Äì4 Demise =May Day 1920= A political cartoon from the Memphis Commercial Appeal depicting an anarchist attempting to destroy the Statue of Liberty Within Attorney General Palmer's Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division (GID) headed by J. Edgar Hoover had become a storehouse of information about radicals in America. It had infiltrated many organizations and, following the raids of November 1919 and January 1920, it had interrogated thousands of those arrested and read through boxes of publications and records seized. Though agents in the GID knew there was a gap between what the radicals promised in their rhetoric and what they were capable of accomplishing, they nevertheless told Palmer they had evidence of plans for an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government on May Day 1920.Coben, 234-5 With Palmer's backing, Hoover warned the nation to expect the worst: assassinations, bombings, and general strikes. Palmer issued his own warning on April 29, 1920, claiming to have a \\"list of marked men\\"New York Times: \\"Nation-Wide Plot to Kill High Officials on Red May Day Revealed by Palmer\\", April 30, 1920.

Newspapers headlined his words: \\"Terror Reign by Radicals, says Palmer\\" and \\"Nation-wide Uprising on Saturday.\\" Localities prepared their police forces and some states mobilized their militias. New York City's 11,000-man police force worked for 32 hours straight.

Palmer's embarrassment buttressed Louis Freeland Post's position in opposition to the Palmer raids when he testified before a Congressional Committee on May 7‚Äì8.Coben, 235-6; Post, 238ff =Collapse= Once Palmer's warnings of a May Day attempt to overthrow the government proved false, the anti-Bolshevik hysteria wound down quickly.Gage, 179-82 In testimony before Congress on May 7‚Äì8, Louis Freeland Post defended his release of hundreds seized in Palmer's raids so successfully that attempts to impeach or censure him ended.Ackerman, 277-80, 289‚Äì94 Later in the month, a dozen prominent lawyers including Felix Frankfurter and Roscoe Pound endorsed a report that condemned Palmer's Justice Department for the \\"utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws\\" including entrapment, police brutality, prolonged incommunicado detention, and violations of due process in court.Brown, To the American People, 4; Coben, 238-9 In June, Massachusetts Federal District Court Judge George Anderson ordered the discharge of twenty more arrested aliens and effectively ended the possibility of additional raids.Stone, 225-26 The conservative Christian Science Monitor found itself unable to support Palmer any longer, writing on June 25, 1920: \\"What appeared to be an excess of radicalism ... was certainly met with ... an excess of suppression.\\"Stone, 226; Chafee, 198 Leaders of industry voiced similar sentiments, including Charles M. Schwab of Bethlehem Steel, who thought Palmer's activities created more radicals than they suppressed, and T. Coleman du Pont who called the Justice Department's work evidence of \\"sheer Red hysteria.\\"Coben, 239; on business leaders' denunciations of the deportations and defense of immigrants from charges of radicalism, see John Higham, Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism (NY: Atheneum, 1968), 232 At the Democratic National Convention in July, Palmer never had a chance at winning the nomination.Pietrusza, 193-4 Coolidge, famous for his opposition to the right of police to strike, won a place on the Republican ticket, but the party's nominee, and the eventual winner of the 1920 election, was the U.S. Senator from Ohio, Warren G. Harding. He sounded a very different note in mid- August. An interviewer wrote that \\"his jaws fairly snapped\\" when he said that \\"too much has been said about Bolshevism in America. It is quite true that there are enemies of Government within our borders. However, I believe their number has been greatly magnified. The American workman is not a Bolshevik; neither is the American employer an autocrat.\\"Google Books: Sherman Rogers, \\"Senator Harding on Labor,\\" in The Outlook, vol. 125, August 18, 1920, 668‚Äì670, quote 670; quoted in part: Gage, 230-1.

In Chile it occurs from 32 to 40¬∞ South Latitude approximately. Populations are found even 2000 m (6500 ft) above sea level. It can grow to 15‚Äì20 m (50‚Äì65 ft) in height. The tree has thick, dark bark; smooth, leathery, shiny, oval evergreen leaves 3‚Äì5 cm long; white star-shaped flowers 15 mm diameter borne in dense corymbs; and a dry fruit with five follicles each containing 10‚Äì20 seeds. Characteristics The inner bark of Quillaja saponaria can be reduced to powder and employed as a substitute for soap, since it forms a lather with water, owing to the presence of a glycoside saponin, sometimes distinguished as quillaia saponin. It's also applied as an agricultural spray adjuvant. The same, or a closely similar substance, is found in soapwort (Saponaria officinalis), in senega root (Polygala senega) and in sarsaparilla; it appears to be chemically related to digitonin, which occurs in digitalis. The wood is used in cabinetry, and scents derived from the tree are used in perfumes and cosmetics. Quillaja saponaria in bloom, University of California, Berkeley, USA, July 2019 (by Amber Kerr). Uses Soap bark tree has a long history of medicinal use with the Andean people who used it as a treatment for various chest problems.Chevallier, A., The Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants, 1996 It is the source of quillaia, the extract of which is used as a food additive and as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and fire-fighting foam. It is used as an additive in photographic films and as a foaming agent for drinks. The saponin content of the bark helps to stimulate the production of a more watery mucus in the airways, thus facilitating the removal of phlegm through coughing.Chevallier, A., The Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants, 1996 The saponins of this tree are also considered to have adjuvant properties for vaccine solutions.Singh, Manmohan, 2007.

The person making a trivial objection may appear ready to accept the argument in question, but at the same time they will oppose it in many different ways. These objections can appear in the form of lists, hypotheticals, and even accusations. Such objections themselves may be valid, but they fail to confront the main argument under consideration. Instead, the objection opposes a small, irrelevant part of the main argument. The fallacy is committed because of this diversion; it is fallacious to oppose a point on the basis of minor and incidental aspects, rather than responding to the main claim.

Playing career After playing in the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL), Kaleta joined the NHL with the Chicago Black Hawks in 1941‚Äì42. He recorded 28 points in 47 games as a rookie that season. During his tenure with the Black Hawks, he is credited with having begun the tradition of the hat trick during the 1945‚Äì46 season, when he entered a shop in Toronto looking for a new hat. Without enough money to buy one, he reached an agreement with shop owner Sammy Taft that if he scored three goals that night in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, he would earn a free hat. In fact, that night, on January 26, 1946, he scored four goals against the Leafs. While there are other accounts of the hat trick's origin in hockey, Kaleta's story is the one recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame. Kaleta went on to complete the season that year with an NHL career-high 46 points. After four seasons with the Black Hawks, Kaleta joined the New York Rangers in 1948‚Äì49. He recorded consecutive 31-point seasons in two seasons with the Rangers before ending his NHL career by joining the Saskatoon Quakers of the minor pro Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL) in 1951‚Äì52.

She is the fifth child and only biological daughter of former Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi and his second wife Safia Farkash. Military service She trained with the Libyan military, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. Diplomacy In 2010 after sanctions were imposed on Iraq, she arrived in Baghdad with a delegation of 69 officials. Shortly before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, she met with Saddam Hussein. In 2011, she strongly denounced the policies of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. President Barack Obama, calling for a mediation of the Libyan Civil War through an international organization which would exclude them. Ayesha has served as a mediator on behalf of the government with European Union corporations. =UN Goodwill Ambassador= Ayesha Gaddafi was appointed as the United Nations Development Program National Goodwill Ambassador for Libya on 24 July 2009, primarily to address the issues of HIV/AIDS, poverty and women's rights in Libya, all of which are culturally sensitive topics in the country. In February 2011 the United Nations stripped Ayesha of her role as a goodwill ambassador. Legal affairs =Saddam Hussein= In July 2004 she joined the legal defence team of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. =Muntadhar al- Zaidi= Gaddafi is also the head of the charity Wa Attassimou, which defended Muntadhar al-Zaidi when he faced charges stemming from the shoe-hurling incident. Libyan civil war =Travel ban= She was placed under a travel ban on 26 February 2011, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970. =Legal petitions= Gaddafi sued NATO over the bombing of a building in her father's compound which she alleged killed her brother, Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, and her own infant daughter. She claimed that the attack was illegal because it targeted civilian buildings. Gaddafi's lawyers filed the petitions in Brussels and Paris in June 2011. However, on 27 July 2011, it was reported that Belgian prosecutors had declined to investigate the war crimes complaint filed by Gaddafi against NATO, stating that the courts of Belgium lacked jurisdiction to deal with the matter. On 3 June 2012, through her lawyer Nick Kaufman, Ayesha Gaddafi also petitioned the judges of the International Criminal Court requesting that they order the Prosecutor - Fatou Bensouda to disclose what steps she had taken to investigate the murder of her father and brother Mutassim Gaddafi. This application was opposed by the Prosecutor who stated that requiring her to disclose the requested information would intrude on prosecutorial independence and discretion and potentially impede the investigation itself. =Battle of Tripoli= As the Battle for Tripoli reached a climax in mid-August, the Gaddafi family were forced to abandon their fortified compound. On 22 August, Libyan rebels captured her house in the Battle of Tripoli. Among her possessions was a golden sofa shaped like a mermaid with the face of Ayesha, designed by an Egyptian artist. =Flight to Algeria= On 27 August 2011, it was reported by the Egyptian news agency Mena that Libyan rebel fighters had seen six armoured Mercedes-Benz sedans, possibly carrying top Gaddafi regime figures, cross the border at the south- western Libyan town of Ghadames towards Algeria, which at the time was denied by the Algerian authorities. On 29 August, the Algerian government officially announced that Safia Farkash together with Ayesha and her brothers Muhammad and Hannibal (along with his wife Aline Skaf), had crossed into Algeria early on 29 August. An Algerian Foreign Ministry official said all the people in the convoy were now in Algiers, and that all of them had been named in warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for possible war crimes charges. Mourad Benmehidi, the Algerian permanent representative to the United Nations, later confirmed the details of the statement. The family had arrived at a Sahara desert entry point, in a Mercedes and a bus at 8:45 a.m. local time. The exact number of people in the party was unconfirmed, but there were ‚Äúmany children‚Äù and they did not include Colonel Gaddafi. The group was allowed in on humanitarian grounds, because Ayesha was pregnant and near her term. The Algerian government had since informed the head of the National Transitional Council. Libya's rebels said sheltering Gaddafi family members was an act of aggression, and called for their extradition. On 30 August 2011 it was announced that Ayesha had given birth to a girl in the city of Djanet. They were reportedly being confined by the Algerian government to a villa in Staoueli near Algiers, and were being cut off from outside communications. In October 2012 she, along with two of her brothers and other family members left Algeria to go to Oman, where they were granted political asylum. The EU amended their sanctions list in 2014, but did not include Ayesha, and rejected her requests to be removed from the list. She then sued on the basis that after the death of her father, there was now no reason for any bans.[17]. In May of 2016, her mother and some of her family were allowed to return to Libya, still they were rejected and also went back to Oman as an asylum seeker but Ayesha Gaddafi remained in Oman.[18] In January 2017, European Union‚Äôs General Court announced that her appeal had been successful, and that all sanctions and travel bans were now lifted. The court directed that EU governments pay court costs.[17] Personal life Ayesha was dubbed in the Arab press as the \\"Claudia Schiffer of North Africa,\\" because of her dyed hair. In 2006 she married Ahmed al-Gaddafi al-Qahsi, a cousin of her father's and an army colonel. Her husband was killed in the 26 July bombing of Gaddafi‚Äôs compound. They had three children prior to the fall of the regime, one of whom was killed along with one of her brothers in a NATO airstrike and another killed along with her husband in the bombing of Gaddafi's compound. Algerian authorities confirmed that she gave birth to her fourth child, a baby girl, on 30 August 2011, shortly after arriving there after fleeing Libya with other members of the Gaddafi family. Shortly after arriving in Algeria they moved to Oman.

He was thus treated as Nobunaga's most important retainer and would come to fight in every important battle under Nobunaga's command such as the 1567 Siege of Inabayama Castle, the 1571 and 1573 Siege of Nagashima. Biography Born in what is now Minami-ku, Nagoya (situated in contemporary Aichi District, Owari Province) and serving under Oda Nobuhide, Sakuma was entrusted with the care of the young Oda Nobunaga. Although he briefly supported Oda Nobuyuki in his abortive attempts at rebellion in 1557. Unlike other retainers whose support Oda Nobunaga as clan leader, Sakuma remained steadfastly loyal to Nobunaga, and fought for him consistently. Sakuma was called Noki Sakuma (ÈÄÄ„Åç‰Ωê‰πÖÈñì), which literally means \\"retreating Sakuma,\\" because of his cautious tactics. He was successful in the campaign against the Rokkaku clan and helped to suppress rebellions caused by Buddhist sects in Echizen Province and at Nagashima in Osaka. In 1572, his 3,000-man unit formed part of the reinforcements dispatched by Nobunaga to aid Tokugawa Ieyasu's approximately 8,000 soldiers against the 30,000 led by Takeda Shingen in the Battle of Mikatagahara, Sakuma retreated after a preliminary engagement. His fellow commander Hirate Hirohide, however, who fought alongside the Tokugawa troops, lost his life, and the conflict ended with a crushing defeat of the Tokugawa-Oda alliance. In 1575 he participated in the Battle of Nagashino against the Takeda clan. In 1576, after Harada Naomasa's death during the campaign against the heavily fortified and well- supplied Honganji temple in Osaka, Sakuma was chosen as Harada's replacement as commander of the Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji and given troops from seven provinces placing him in command of the largest Oda-clan army among the Oda retainers. However, unlike his colleagues Akechi Mitsuhide, Shibata Katsuie or Hashiba Hideyoshi who all won battles on the fronts to which they were assigned, Nobumori made no progress against the fearless Buddhist zealots. After ten years of warring, Nobunaga had the emperor mediate a truce to end the war in 1580. That same year, Nobunaga drafted a document containing a fifteen-point accusation against Sakuma's, including past failures with those against the Honganji. Nobunaga banished Sakuma and his son Sakuma Nobuhide to the temple on Mount Koyasan, where they were forced to spend their days in the monk lifestyle. The man who came to lead the largest force in the Kinki area after Nobumori was Akechi Mitsuhide, and along with the severe human affairs which brought unrest to the vassals, this banishment was often said to be linked to the Honnoji Incident. Sakuma died in 1582 at Totsugawa in Yamato Province. He was posthumously named Doumu Keigan (Ê¥ûÁÑ°Ê°ÇÂ∑å) and Souyu (ÂÆó‰Ωë). Nobumori's banishment has widely been regarded as representative of Nobunaga's cold-blooded treatment against even his longest-serving retainers underscoring the clan leader's shortcomings as a military commander. Nobumori, however, had reportedly held frequent tea parties and seemed more interested in these rather than focusing on military affairs. He never devised, after all, any overarching military measures against the Honganji, even though their war had remained in a stalemate. It has also been recorded that since childhood, Nobumori had been openly critical of Nobunaga.

The red line is temperature, the green line is the dew point, and the yellow line is the air parcel lifted. In meteorology, convective available potential energy (commonly abbreviated as CAPE), is the integrated amount of work that the upward (positive) buoyancy force would perform on a given mass of air (called an air parcel) if it rose vertically through the entire atmosphere. Positive CAPE will cause the air parcel to rise, while negative CAPE will cause the air parcel to sink. Nonzero CAPE is an indicator of atmospheric instability in any given atmospheric sounding, a necessary condition for the development of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds with attendant severe weather hazards.  Mechanics  A Skew-T diagram with important features labeled CAPE exists within the conditionally unstable layer of the troposphere, the free convective layer (FCL), where an ascending air parcel is warmer than the ambient air. CAPE is measured in joules per kilogram of air (J/kg). Any value greater than 0 J/kg indicates instability and an increasing possibility of thunderstorms and hail. Generic CAPE is calculated by integrating vertically the local buoyancy of a parcel from the level of free convection (LFC) to the equilibrium level (EL): mathrm{CAPE} = int_{z_mathrm{f}}^{z_mathrm{n}} g left(frac{T_mathrm{v,parcel} - T_mathrm{v,env}}{T_mathrm{v,env}}right) , dz Where z_mathrm{f} is the height of the level of free convection and z_mathrm{n} is the height of the equilibrium level (neutral buoyancy), where T_mathrm{v,parcel} is the virtual temperature of the specific parcel, where T_mathrm{v,env} is the virtual temperature of the environment (note that temperatures must be in the Kelvin scale), and where g is the acceleration due to gravity. This integral is the work done by the buoyant force minus the work done against gravity, hence it's the excess energy that can become kinetic energy. CAPE for a given region is most often calculated from a thermodynamic or sounding diagram (e.g., a Skew-T log-P diagram) using air temperature and dew point data usually measured by a weather balloon. CAPE is effectively positive buoyancy, expressed B+ or simply B; the opposite of convective inhibition (CIN), which is expressed as B-, and can be thought of as \\"negative CAPE\\". As with CIN, CAPE is usually expressed in J/kg but may also be expressed as m2/s2, as the values are equivalent. In fact, CAPE is sometimes referred to as positive buoyant energy (PBE). This type of CAPE is the maximum energy available to an ascending parcel and to moist convection. When a layer of CIN is present, the layer must be eroded by surface heating or mechanical lifting, so that convective boundary layer parcels may reach their level of free convection (LFC). On a sounding diagram, CAPE is the positive area above the LFC, the area between the parcel's virtual temperature line and the environmental virtual temperature line where the ascending parcel is warmer than the environment. Neglecting the virtual temperature correction may result in substantial relative errors in the calculated value of CAPE for small CAPE values. CAPE may also exist below the LFC, but if a layer of CIN (subsidence) is present, it is unavailable to deep, moist convection until CIN is exhausted. When there is mechanical lift to saturation, cloud base begins at the lifted condensation level (LCL); absent forcing, cloud base begins at the convective condensation level (CCL) where heating from below causes spontaneous buoyant lifting to the point of condensation when the convective temperature is reached. When CIN is absent or is overcome, saturated parcels at the LCL or CCL, which had been small cumulus clouds, will rise to the LFC, and then spontaneously rise until hitting the stable layer of the equilibrium level. The result is deep, moist convection (DMC), or simply, a thunderstorm. When a parcel is unstable, it will continue to move vertically, in either direction, dependent on whether it receives upward or downward forcing, until it reaches a stable layer (though momentum, gravity, and other forcing may cause the parcel to continue). There are multiple types of CAPE, downdraft CAPE (DCAPE), estimates the potential strength of rain and evaporatively cooled downdrafts. Other types of CAPE may depend on the depth being considered. Other examples are surface based CAPE (SBCAPE), mixed layer or mean layer CAPE (MLCAPE), most unstable or maximum usable CAPE (MUCAPE), and normalized CAPE (NCAPE). Fluid elements displaced upwards or downwards in such an atmosphere expand or compress adiabatically in order to remain in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings, and in this manner become less or more dense. If the adiabatic decrease or increase in density is less than the decrease or increase in the density of the ambient (not moved) medium, then the displaced fluid element will be subject to downwards or upwards pressure, which will function to restore it to its original position. Hence, there will be a counteracting force to the initial displacement. Such a condition is referred to as convective stability. On the other hand, if adiabatic decrease or increase in density is greater than in the ambient fluid, the upwards or downwards displacement will be met with an additional force in the same direction exerted by the ambient fluid. In these circumstances, small deviations from the initial state will become amplified. This condition is referred to as convective instability. Convective instability is also termed static instability, because the instability does not depend on the existing motion of the air; this contrasts with dynamic instability where instability is dependent on the motion of air and its associated effects such as dynamic lifting.  Significance to thunderstorms  Thunderstorms form when air parcels are lifted vertically. Deep, moist convection requires a parcel to be lifted to the LFC where it then rises spontaneously until reaching a layer of non-positive buoyancy. The atmosphere is warm at the surface and lower levels of the troposphere where there is mixing (the planetary boundary layer (PBL)), but becomes substantially cooler with height. The temperature profile of the atmosphere, the change in temperature, the degree that it cools with height, is the lapse rate. When the rising air parcel cools more slowly than the surrounding atmosphere, it remains warmer and less dense. The parcel continues to rise freely (convectively; without mechanical lift) through the atmosphere until it reaches an area of air less dense (warmer) than itself. The amount, and shape, of the positive-buoyancy area modulates the speed of updrafts, thus extreme CAPE can result in explosive thunderstorm development; such rapid development usually occurs when CAPE stored by a capping inversion is released when the \\"lid\\" is broken by heating or mechanical lift. The amount of CAPE also modulates how low-level vorticity is entrained and then stretched in the updraft, with importance to tornadogenesis. The most important CAPE for tornadoes is within the lowest 1 to 3 km (0.6 to 1.9 mi) of the atmosphere, whilst deep layer CAPE and the width of CAPE at mid-levels is important for supercells. Tornado outbreaks tend to occur within high CAPE environments. Large CAPE is required for the production of very large hail, owing to updraft strength, although a rotating updraft may be stronger with less CAPE. Large CAPE also promotes lightning activity. Two notable days for severe weather exhibited CAPE values over 5 kJ/kg. Two hours before the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak occurred on May 3, 1999, the CAPE value sounding at Oklahoma City was at 5.89 kJ/kg. A few hours later, an F5 tornado ripped through the southern suburbs of the city. Also on May 4, 2007 CAPE values of 5.5 kJ/kg were reached and an EF5 tornado tore through Greensburg, Kansas. On these days, it was apparent that conditions were ripe for tornadoes and CAPE wasn't a crucial factor. However, extreme CAPE, by modulating the updraft (and downdraft), can allow for exceptional events, such as the deadly F5 tornadoes that hit Plainfield, Illinois on August 28, 1990 and Jarrell, Texas on May 27, 1997 on days which weren't readily apparent as conducive to large tornadoes. CAPE was estimated to exceed 8 kJ/kg in the environment of the Plainfield storm and was around 7 kJ/kg for the Jarrell storm. Severe weather and tornadoes can develop in an area of low CAPE values. The surprise severe weather event that occurred in Illinois and Indiana on April 20, 2004 is a good example. Importantly in that case, was that although overall CAPE was weak, there was strong CAPE in the lowest levels of the troposphere which enabled an outbreak of minisupercells producing large, long-track, intense tornadoes.  Example from meteorology  A good example of convective instability can be found in our own atmosphere. If dry mid-level air is drawn over very warm, moist air in the lower troposphere, a hydrolapse (an area of rapidly decreasing dew point temperatures with height) results in the region where the moist boundary layer and mid-level air meet. As daytime heating increases mixing within the moist boundary layer, some of the moist air will begin to interact with the dry mid- level air above it. Owing to thermodynamic processes, as the dry mid-level air is slowly saturated its temperature begins to drop, increasing the adiabatic lapse rate. Under certain conditions, the lapse rate can increase significantly in a short amount of time, resulting in convection. High convective instability can lead to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes as moist air which is trapped in the boundary layer eventually becomes highly negatively buoyant relative to the adiabatic lapse rate and escapes as a rapidly rising bubble of humid air triggering the development of a cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud.

On the night of August 29, 1975, Mayer was using an automatic camera to photograph the sky, hoping to track meteors large enough to survive entry into the Earth's atmosphere. After learning of the nova, he realized it was in the part of the sky he was photographing. He retrieved his negatives from the trash (there were no meteors on the photographs) and found a series of images of Nova Cygni 1975 in several stages of brightening. Mayer was a member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers and a frequent lecturer at the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference. In 1982 he won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Perhaps the best words summarizing Mayer's contributions and style appeared in The Griffith Observer memorial as written by Ed Krupp, Director of the Griffith Observatory in the June, 2000 edition (Vol 64, No. 6).

The chain continues north into the Tararua, then Ruahine Ranges, running parallel with the east coast between Wellington and East Cape. The 555-metre summit of the road over the range at its northern saddle is named Remutaka Pass. The pass was formally named on 17 December 2015 when the Minister of Land Information confirmed the decision of the New Zealand Geographic Board. Following the passage of the RangitƒÅne T≈´ Mai RƒÅ (Wairarapa Tamaki nui-ƒÅ-Rua) Claims Settlement Act 2017, the name of the range officially changed to Remutaka Range. Geography The Remutaka Range runs north-east to south-west for 55 kilometres from the upper reaches of the Hutt Valley (where the range's northern saddle abuts the southern end of the Tararuas) to Turakirae Head at the western end of Palliser Bay. The highest peak is Mount Matthews, at 940 metres, near the southern end of the range.

The Tararua Range runs northeast-southwest for from near Palmerston North to the upper reaches of the Hutt Valley, where the northern tip of the Remutaka Range begins. It is separated in the north from the southern end of the Ruahine Range by the Manawatu Gorge. The highest peak in the Tararuas is Pukeamoamo / Mitre (not to be confused with Mitre Peak) at . Other prominent peaks include Mount Bannister at and Mount Hector at , which is named after the scientist Sir James Hector. Its MƒÅori name is Pukemoumou, or 'hill of desolation'. Geography The Tararua Range is divided into two distinct northern and southern regions. Both of these are dominated by a central mountain peak: Arete in the north and Hector in the south. A total of ten rivers rise on the mountain slopes, providing water for the surrounding rural and urban areas from Palmerston North to Wellington. A number of ranges radiate out from the mountains, the largest of which is the Main Range linking the twin clusters of northern and southern peaks.Maclean (1994), pp. 26‚Äì30 The summits of the ranges average between 1,300 and 1,500 metres in height. This consistency indicates that the region was once part of a level plain. About 10 million years ago parts of this relatively low-lying area were thrust up, creating a mountainous backbone for the southern part of the North Island. Subsequent erosion contributed to the present pattern of parallel ranges divided by deep river valleys. The ranges provide a back-drop for the Kapiti coastal plain. = Mountain Peaks= The 15 peaks in the Tararuas of 1,500m or higher are (from north to south): Logan 1,500m, Bannister 1,537m, South Bannister 1,513m, Arete 1,505m, Lancaster 1,504m, Brocket 1,538m, Pukeamoamo / Mitre 1,571m, Peggys Peak 1,545m, Girdlestone 1,546m, North King 1,535m, Middle King 1,521m, South King 1,531m, McGregor 1,540m, Angle Knob 1,510m, Mount Hector 1,529m. Other notable peaks in the range are Jumbo Peak (1405m) and Mount Holdsworth (1470m). Climate and vegetation The western slopes of the ranges are subject to prevailing moisture-carrying winds, channelled by Cook Strait to the south. These are the source of an annual rainfall of approximately 5,000 mm, resulting in the dominance of conifers, ferns and shrubs on the western side of the ranges. By contrast, the pattern on the eastern side is one of open beech forest in a drier environment. In spite of a reputation of being composed of gloomy bush, impenetrable leatherwood, and wet snow tussocks on mist-shrouded tops, the Tararua Range has a wide diversity of vegetation, ranging from alpine tussock grasslands and subalpine shrublands to forests of montane miro/kamahi, or beech or lowland broadleaf forests with emergent podocarps and kamahi. The forest in the northern part of the Tararuas consists mainly of tawa and miro indigenous woodlands. Further south species such as beech are widely seen. Finally, along the west slopes of the ranges facing the Tasman Sea, mixed native species such as rimu, tarrier, matai, totara and kahikatea are dominant. History The rugged terrain and frequently harsh weather of the Tararua Range served to discourage any substantial attempt at penetration by early MƒÅori. Although there is archaeological evidence of exploration by moa hunters as early as the twelfth century, the mountains remained a massive physical divide between the tribal settlements located along rivers, lakes and coastlines to the east and west. Some of the Ngati Mamoe (early Maori settlers on the neighboring Kapiti Coast) are reputed to have taken refuge in the Tararua mountains after they were displaced by the Rangitane and Muaupoko iwi (tribal groups). The Ngati Mamoe survivors attained a mythical status as the patupaiarehe (fairy folk) of the Taruruas.Maclean (1994), page 41 In the 1820s the Muaupoko in turn were forced to flee to the ranges when under attack by the NgƒÅti Toa led by Te Rauparaha. In spite of such intrusions, the mountain range remained the home of distant gods or hostile wild men (maero). As such, it was a special place to be respected but avoided.Maclean (1994), pages 68 and 78 In the 1870s a large portion of the ranges was sold to the New Zealand Government by a coalition of the Iwi in possession of the surrounding region. Specifically excluded from this \\"Tararua Block\\" purchase was an area of 1,000 acres reserved to protect the sacred lake Hapuakorari, the exact location of which remained uncertain.Maclean (1994), pp. 68‚Äì71 European settlers, like their MƒÅori counterparts, found the steep ridges and deep valleys of the Tararua Range difficult of access and intimidating in scale. The range accordingly escaped the development of the fertile plains that bordered on it. In 1881 36,000 acres of the Tararua Block, including key catchment areas for four rivers, was classified as State Forest, subject to protection. Additional watersheds were added over the following decades, to create a Crown conservation reserve in excess of 250,000 acres. The scenic beauty of the Tararuas made the mountains a popular subject for paintings during the Victorian period ‚Äì though largely romanticized and usually undertaken from a distance.Maclean (1994), pp. 106‚Äì107 By the 1920s, with the neighboring countryside largely settled, the potential of the ranges as an area for outdoor recreation rather than for exploitation began to be recognized. Tararua Forest Park Otaki River near Otaki Forks. The 116,535 hectare Tararua Forest Park covers more than three- quarters of the Tararua Range. It is administered by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and extends from the Pahiatua Track in the north, to the Rimutaka Saddle in the south. The main entrance on the eastern side of the ranges is at Holdsworth, and on the west side from ≈åtaki Forks. Roads The only all-weather road right across the range is the \\"Pahiatua Track\\", which joins Palmerston North and Pahiatua. It is now used more heavily since the Manawatu Gorge road was permanently closed in 2017 due to recurring large landslides. Recreation The Tararua Range serves as a popular tramping location for the greater Wellington district. It is one of the most frequently entered ranges in the country, with between 120,000 and 150,000 people visiting each year. Among the many tramping tracks is the well-known \\"Southern Crossing\\" running from ≈åtaki Forks in the west, over Mount Hector and exiting via Kaitoke. =Camping= Waiohine Gorge campsite map The hills include 6 campsites. They are accessible by car, although visitors may need to travel over gravel roads that contain occasional fords. Campsites are generally located within the foothills of the range, alongside a river or stream. =Tramping= Waiohine River gorge, route of the 'Hill and Sutch' party The Tararua Range is significant in the history of tramping in New Zealand, due to its accessibility for people in Wellington and nearby towns. In April 1933, it was the focus of what later came to be known as The Sutch Search when Mr Eric Hill, Miss Morva Williams, Mr Bert O‚ÄôKeefe and Dr. Bill Sutch went missing for more than two weeks during an attempt to traverse from Te Matawai Hut to Mount Holdsworth during winter. An accident while sidling the Broken Axe Pinnacles prevented the group getting to Mt Holdsworth in a day as planned. Then bad weather forced them off the ridge tops. It took more than two weeks for them to find a route down the untracked Waiohine River.Maclean (1994) The group was noticed to be missing after a week, at which time a search developed that eventually involved roughly 200 people and solicited many donations from members of the public. The search was the first in New Zealand to involve radio communications and aircraft, and is generally considered to be one of the major contributing events towards the formation of New Zealand's voluntary Land Search and Rescue service (LSAR). It was covered intensely by media at the time, and when the group finally returned they sparked strong public debate regarding the responsibilities of those who enter the wilderness. A combination of steep terrain, dense bush, difficult river crossings and changeable winter weather conditions has caused over twenty-two tramping deaths in the Tararua Range since 1970, most recently one in June 2019. Other deaths included those of the Chief Executive of the National Museum of New Zealand Te Papa: Dr Seddon Bennington and a friend Marcella Jackson, who died of hypothermia in June 2009.Dominion Post, 15 July 2009 =Mountain running racing= The Tararua Mountain Race, following a track of , from Kaitoke to ≈åtaki Forks, has been held annually since 1990.

Hearst had owned 80 percent of the company after increasing its ownership stake by 30 percent on December 12, 2014, in a transaction valued at $1.965 billion. Hearst's previous equity interest was 50 percent following expansions on an original acquisition in 2006. Hearst had jointly owned Fitch with FIMALAC SA, which held 20 percent of the company until the 2018 transaction. Fitch Ratings and Fitch Solutions are part of the Fitch Group. The firm was founded by John Knowles Fitch on December 24, 1914, in New York City as the Fitch Publishing Company. In 1989, the company was acquired by a group including Robert Van Kampen. In 1997, Fitch was acquired by FIMALAC and was merged with London-based IBCA Limited, a FIMALAC subsidiary. In 2000 Fitch acquired both Chicago-based Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. (April) and Thomson Financial BankWatch (December). Fitch Ratings is the third largest NRSRO rating agency, covering a more limited share of the market than S&P; and Moody's, though it has grown with acquisitions and frequently positions itself as a \\"tie-breaker\\" when the other two agencies have ratings similar, but not equal, in scale. In September 2011, Fitch Group announced the sale of Algorithmics (risk analytics software) to IBM for $387 million. The deal closed on October 21, 2011.  Investment scale  Fitch Ratings' long-term credit ratings are assigned on an alphabetic scale from 'AAA' to 'D', first introduced in 1924 and later adopted and licensed by S&P.; Like S&P;, Fitch also uses intermediate +/‚àí modifiers for each category between AA and CCC (e.g., AA+, AA, AA‚àí, A+, A, A‚àí, BBB+, BBB, BBB‚àí, etc.). Investment grade * AAA : the best quality companies, reliable and stable * AA : quality companies, a bit higher risk than AAA * A : economic situation can affect finance * BBB : medium class companies, which are satisfactory at the moment Non-investment grade * BB : more prone to changes in the economy * B : financial situation varies noticeably * CCC : currently vulnerable and dependent on favorable economic conditions to meet its commitments * CC : highly vulnerable, very speculative bonds * C : highly vulnerable, perhaps in bankruptcy or in arrears but still continuing to pay out on obligations * D : has defaulted on obligations and Fitch believes that it will generally default on most or all obligations * NR : not publicly rated  Short-term credit ratings  Fitch's short-term ratings indicate the potential level of default within a 12-month period. * F1+ : best quality grade, indicating exceptionally strong capacity of obligor to meet its financial commitment * F1 : best quality grade, indicating strong capacity of obligor to meet its financial commitment * F2 : good quality grade with satisfactory capacity of obligor to meet its financial commitment * F3 : fair quality grade with adequate capacity of obligor to meet its financial commitment but near term adverse conditions could impact the obligor's commitments * B : of speculative nature and obligor has minimal capacity to meet its commitment and vulnerability to short term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions * C : possibility of default is high and the financial commitment of the obligor are dependent upon sustained, favorable business and economic conditions * D : the obligor is in default as it has failed on its financial commitments.  Fitch Solutions  Launched in 2008, Fitch Solutions offers a range of fixed-income products and professional development services for financial professionals. The firm also distributes Fitch Ratings' proprietary credit ratings, research, financial data, and analytical tools. Criticism The main credit rating agencies, including Fitch, were accused of misrepresenting the risks associated with mortgage-related securities, which included the CDO market. There were large losses in the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market that occurred despite being assigned top ratings by the CRAs. For instance, losses on $340.7 million worth of collateralized debt obligations (CDO) issued by Credit Suisse Group added up to about $125 million, despite being rated AAA by Fitch. However, differently from the other agencies, Fitch has been warning the market on the constant proportion debt obligations (CPDO) with an early and pre-crisis report highlighting the dangers of CPDO's.

Panel√°ks are usually located in housing estates (Czech: s√≠dli≈°tƒõ, Slovak: s√≠dlisko). [plural: ] is derived from the standard or meaning, literally, \\"panel house / prefabricated-sections house\\". The term panel√°k is used mainly for the elongate blocks with more sections with separate entrances ‚Äì simple panel tower blocks are called \\"vƒõ≈æov√Ω d≈Øm\\" (tower house) or colloquially \\"vƒõ≈æ√°k\\". The buildings remain a towering, highly visible reminder of the communist era. The term panel√°k refers specifically to buildings in the former Czechoslovakia. However, similar buildings were built in other communist countries and even in the West. History Petr≈æalka, Bratislava, Slovakia Interwar Czechoslovakia saw many constructivist architects in the country, such as Vladim√≠r Karf√≠k and Franti≈°ek Lydie Gahura, many of whom would maintain prominence following the establishment of the Czechoslovak People's Republic in 1948. In the years following 1948, the Czechoslovakian architectural scene favored Stalinist architecture over more modern architecture. However, a 1954 speech by Nikita Khruschev encouraging the construction of panel buildings, coupled by post-war housing shortages faced throughout both eastern and western Europe, encouraged the country's architectures to construct more simplistic, modernist buildings. Throughout the mid 1950s, the country's designers applied a modernist aesthetic known as the , named after the international attention it attracted during the 1958 World‚Äôs Fair held in Brussels. By the late 1960s, the country's panel√°ks often reached up to 16 stories in height. The As of 2005, they housed about 3.5 million people, or about one-third of the country's population. S√≠dlisko III, Pre≈°ov, Slovakia. Following the country's Velvet Revolution in 1989, there was widespread speculation that the country's panel√°ks would fall out of favor, due to their simplicity and small size. The Czech government sold the panel√°ks to their tenets for cheap prices, furthering speculation that the apartments would be undesirable. However, these fears have not materialized. Characteristics Towering panel√°ks in the Kam√Ωk area of Prague. A typical panel√°k apartment has a foyer, bathroom, kitchen, a living room also used for dining, and a bedroom. All panel√°ks in the Czech Republic were constructed to follow one of sixteen design patterns. Panel√°ks have been criticized for their simplistic design, poor-quality building materials, and their tendency to become overcrowded. In 1990, V√°clav Havel, who was then the president of Czechoslovakia, called panel√°ks \\"undignified rabbit pens, slated for liquidation\\". Panel√°k housing estates as a whole are said to be mere bedroom communities with few conveniences and even less character. However, panel√°ks have also been praised by many. Upon their introduction, panel√°ks offered more reliable heating, hot water, and plumbing than existing buildings, especially those in rural locations. The buildings typically offered large amounts of natural light, compared to their older counterparts. Panel√°ks today Prague-Z√°bƒõhlice, the housing estate Zahradn√≠ Mƒõsto-v√Ωchod. Panel√°ks remain commonplace today, and have attracted a wide diversity of social classes. Fears that panel√°ks would become undesirable and be subject to middle class flight, commonplace following the Velvet Revolution, have not materialized. Panel√°k apartments have risen in value more than brick apartments, have been praised for housing people from a wide variety of incomes, and have been subject to a number of positive cultural depictions including magazines and TV shows. Most Panel√°k apartments also are rent-controlled, and are therefore significantly cheaper than newer not rent-controlled flats. Areas with high shares of its population living in panel√°ks include the city of Karvina (where apprxomiately 97% of people live in them), Petr≈æalka,, and the city of Most (approx. 80%). Most's historical city was largely torn down due to the spread of coal mining and the majority of its population was moved into panel√°ks. = Amenities = Some Czech sociologists fear that panel√°k inhabitants may lack amenities, and suffer from being unable to physically access distant businesses and commercial centres. To combat this, certain local authorities are making significant efforts to prevent this scenario by changing bedroom communities into multifunctional urban neighbourhoods. This may include support for the construction of missing facilities, such as shopping centres, churches, or improved transport accessibility. Panel√°ks, particularly in big cities, are often the first targets for builders of telecommunication networks, as the housing estates combine a high concentration of people with easy access to underground and in-house spaces for cables. Panel√°k housing estates are usually the first neighbourhoods with access to cable TV, WiFi network coverage, cable-modem service, DSL and other telecommunication services. = Renovations = In 2005, the director of the Czech Ministry of Regional Development expressed concerns that the country's panel√°ks were near the end of their lifespan, citing an increasing number of structural incidents. He estimated that his agency would need 400 billion Czech koruna to modernize the country's panel√°ks, and 1.5 trillion to tear them down entirely. In recent years, many panel√°ks have been renovated, partially due to funds from the European Union. A sizable renovation market has formed in recent years, and even a home magazine, Panel Plus, exists to give renovators ideas. = Ownership = Following the Velvet Revolution, most panel√°ks were sold to their tenets at low costs. Many panel√°k flats are now the property of their inhabitants, though they are also rented out through private landlords. The buildings are often managed by managed by housing cooperatives, municipalities, self-governing non-profit organizations, or through public- private partnership. Other countries Communist era apartment buildings in alt= Buildings similar to panel√°ks were built also in other communist countries, and they are a common feature of cityscapes across Central and Eastern Europe, and to some degree Northern Europe. One of the most drastic reconstruction policies of the Eastern Bloc was the systematization programme that took place in the 1970s and 1980s under Nicolae Ceau»ôescu in Romania. In 1971 Ceau»ôescu visited North Korea and was impressed by the Juche ideology. He enacted a mass programme of demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to build blocks of flats (blocuri). In Bulgaria, buildings similar to panel√°ks are colloquially known as \\"panelki\\", and are the predominant type of en masse housing throughout the country. In Hungary, similar buildings are called panelh√°z. In Poland, they are called \\"bloki\\" (blocks), or \\"wielka p≈Çyta\\" (the great panel). In Germany they are known as Plattenbau. Most buildings in Soviet-era Microdistricts are panel buildings. In the European Union, among former communist countries, a majority of the population lives in flats in Latvia (65.1%), Estonia (63.8%), Lithuania (58.4%), Czech Republic (52.8%) and Slovakia (50.3%) (as of 2014, data from Eurostat).see section Source data for tables and figures, Housing statistics: tables and figures However, not all flat dwellers in Eastern Europe live in communist era blocks of flats; many live in buildings constructed after the fall of communism, and some in buildings surviving from the era before communism. In the United States, some housing estates have buildings that are similar or actually are panel√°ks, or they are built from the same or similar material.

She loses control and mortally wounds Josh.New Mutants vol. 2 #10 Laurie witnesses the attack and uses her pheromone powers to drive away Rahne.New Mutants vol. 2 #11 While he is rushed to the mansion's infirmary, Beast reveals the full potential of Josh's power: he can manipulate all the body's functions on a genetic level, and the fact that Josh only heals is simply inexperience. With Archangel, the mansion's other healer, absent, the residents resort to electrically shocking Josh awake so that he can heal himself. As an unexpected side effect, Josh turns his skin and hair to a reflective gold color.New Mutants vol. 2 #12 He is assigned to Dani's New Mutant squad and given the codename Elixir.New X-Men: Academy X #1 Rahne attempts to end her relationship with Josh after she becomes a teacher at the school, but Josh is persistent and they continue to see each other secretly.

Josh is depressed at first, but eventually realizes that it was for the best and pursues a relationship with Laurie. However, Wither also has a crush on Laurie, and reveals Rahne's and Josh's previous relationship to the school.New X-Men: Academy X #4-9 Most of the New Mutants team ostracize Elixir for his involvement with a teacher. Eventually, the New Mutants squad's in-fighting begins to affect their ability to act as a team. Concerned with the future of her team, Wind Dancer convinces everyone to get together for a camp-out so they can work through their issues with one another. The evening ends with Josh speaking candidly with Icarus about his disappointment over his own actions.

Josh is unable to heal his dying classmates in time, and becomes severely depressed and loses confidence in his abilities. Most of the remaining students take part in a melee fight organized by Emma Frost to determine who will be members in the new group of mutant heroes in-training, the New X-Men. Despite his non-combat powers, Josh makes the team.New X-Men #23-24 Caught up in his emotions over the deceased students, Josh hits a powered-down Colossus over the head with a metal beam during a training session. Furious, Emma temporarily kicks him off the team. Afterwards, Laurie is killed by a bullet fired by one of Stryker's agents.New X-Men #25 Enraged over the death of Laurie, Josh uses his power to kill Stryker. This turns Josh's golden skin into metallic black and leaves him catatonic.New X-Men #26-27 When X-23 is mortally wounded and unable to heal during the final battle with Nimrod, Hellion rushes her back to the Institute with help from Emma Frost, who unlocks the part of his brain which controls his powers.

Josh heals Laura, which also turns his skin back from black to gold.New X-Men #31 Shortly after it is discovered that a small part of black still remains on Josh's skin, moving from place to place. Josh states he could still kill but he will need to learn how to control his powers and use them only to heal.New X-Men #32 He approaches Beast and asks him to teach him everything there is to know about human anatomy, physiology, and biology.New X-Men #33 Elixir gains Beast's advanced expertise in human biology from the Stepford Cuckoos. Before the other students are teleported to Limbo, the Stepford Cuckoos help Elixir learn advanced science by taking information from the Beast's head and putting it into Josh's. This increases his power exponentially, allowing him to heal otherwise-fatal injures with a touch. He also masters his \\"black abilities\\" by being able to switch instantly from golden/healing to black/disease-causing.New X-Men #37-41 He begins a romantic relationship with Loa.New X-Men #43 =X-Force= Due to Elixir being a \\"problem\\" to X-Force, X-23 contacts the Stepford Cuckoos to help Rahne and erase Elixir's memories of the team, by Josh's request. However, before his memories can be erased, X-Force is interrupted and sent on a mission. Elixir joins X-Force and receives a dark-colored uniform. He helps his new team capture Vanisher, creating a deadly brain tumor on his brain. Elixir later keeps X-23 from killing herself after she becomes infected with the Legacy Virus, and helps her get rid of it.X-Force vol. 3 #7-10 Elixir is transported to the future, along with the rest of X-Force, by Cyclops in order to bring Cable and the mutant child back to the present. Once they arrive there Elixir is in a hysterical state over being unable to save his friends from the Leper Queen. When Vanisher is wounded by Deadpool, Josh heals him and later is led to Cable and Hope Summers.X-Force/Cable: Messiah War #1 During his stay in the future, Vanisher constantly tries to get Elixir to undo his tumor only to be turned down.X-Force vol. 3 #14 Upon arriving in the present, Josh cures Nori and Julian but falls into a coma as a result of the strain.

Elixir heals her by transferring some of her baby's strength to her to ensure that she can survive the pregnancy. He and X-Force teleport off to Genosha and once there he informs Vanisher that it's not the tumor making him sick as he removed it in their trip to the future but his stage 4 Syphilis.X-Force vol. 3 #23-24 Elixir faces off against Wither in a fight to the death. Elixir shifts to his black form, then reverses the effects of Wither's powers, telling Kevin he is sorry before turning him to dust. In the aftermath of Necrosha, Wolverine states that Josh has quit the team, citing he is having difficulty shifting out of his black form.X-Force vol. 3 #25 =Wolverine Legacy= In the aftermath of the Death of Wolverine storyline, Elixir was captured by the same individuals that had captured X-23, Sabretooth, Daken, Lady Deathstrike and Mystique. As he was still stuck in his black form, he was unable to attempt to rouse Mystique after Sharp knocked her unconscious with the trigger words, however this proved to be unnecessary as Mystique had already recovered and was just feigning unconsciousness. When Siphon attacked the group shortly after Elixir tried to use his killing powers to stop him - however these had no effect and Josh was quickly overwhelmed. X-23 insisted that they needed to help, but Sabretooth refused and demanded Sharp release them. Sharp, his team, and the captives then scattered to escape.Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy #7 =Utopians= Elixir later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside Karma, Madison Jeffries, Masque, Random, and Tabitha Smith.All-New X-Men #40 =Death and Resurrection = Elixir later resurfaces, having joined a church group to help find himself, when he's tracked down by Sabretooth and M who feels he might be targeted by someone killing mutant healers. While there, the group is attacked by the Dark Riders, and most of the church volunteers are slaughtered. While M and Sabretooth are busy fighting the Riders, Josh begins healing the volunteers en masse, but it was a trap to lure him out and he is shot and killed by Gauntlet.Uncanny X-Men vol. 4 #2 Because of the nature of Josh's powers, he does not remain dead for long, regenerating in his grave before making his way back to Genosha. Emotionally and mentally unstable as a result of his experiences, he tests his expanding powers by torturing the Dark Riders, resurrecting them and killing them over and over again. Magneto and his team learn about his survival and track him down, eventually taking him to one of the medical centers where mutants are being treated for M-Pox. Josh is able to completely heal the mutants there, but the rush of destroying the disease ravaging him leads him to nearly drain the life from the human medical personnel, and then the X-Men when they tried to stop him. They are able to reach and stop him. Josh is taken to Xorn's retreat, in hopes the mutant can help Josh come to terms with the tragedies, and gain control of his powers.Uncanny X-Men Annual (Vol 4) #1 Soon afterward he is approached by Exodus and together both travel to the Savage Land where Magneto has been fatally stabbed by Psylocke. Elixir heals Magneto anew but the master of magnetism declines their invitation to join them, and tells them he must remain \\"dead\\" for the sake of mutantkind. Elixir and Exodus then teleport to parts unknown.Uncanny X-Men (Vol 4) #19 Elixir and Exodus were later approached by Magneto in order to help contain the Mothervine virus, an aggressive and wildly unstable biotech enhancement tailored to engineer mutant childbirths but that also triggered secondary and tertiary mutation within mutants as well as re-trigger primary mutations in depowered mutants who lost their powers on M-Day, which was released worldwide by Miss Sinister, Havok, Emma Frost and Bastion. As Exodus teleported the trio to each Mothervine impact zone, Magneto patrolled the sites for dangers as Elixir managed to cure most people affected by the Mothervine bombs, except for those that already carried a dormant X-Gene. When Elixir was taken to the masterminds' base, he neutralized all samples of the Mothervine serum and even purged it from Jimmy Hudson's system, putting an end to the Mothervine threat once and for all. He also healed Havok's scars sustained during the Planet X.X-Men: Blue #28 =The Five= When Professor X uses Krakoa as the home for the new mutant nation in the Pacific Ocean east of Papua New Guinea, Elixir is revealed to be part of a group known as \\"The Five\\" which is made of five specific individuals whose purpose has a significant ramifications going forward for the X-Men's survival in general. Besides Elixir, The Five is made up of Goldballs (Fabio Medina), Proteus, Tempus and Hope Summers, and they all have an important part to play in keeping mutants alive, as they are the ones responsible for the several resurrections that occurred off-panel. Through Goldballs' abilities to create golden orbs of matter which it is discovered aren't just orbs of biological matter, but eggs that he can create in limitless supply, allows Proteus, who can warp reality, to make those eggs viable. They next inject into those eggs, preserved DNA of a mutant, allowing Elixir to kickstart the process of cellular replication, paving the way for a mutant embryo to grow inside the egg. That process would take quite a bit of time of course, but Eva Bell is able to control time, so she speeds up the process. That's when Magneto explains that while each member of the group couldn't achieve these feats on their own, they have Hope's abilities to unify them and allow all parts to run at peak velocity and unison. Powers and abilities Elixir is an Omega-level mutant, capable of controlling the biological structure of any organic matter including his own body. He must be in proximity to whomever he uses his power on. Besides healing, he is capable of boosting and restoring mutant abilities, causing painful boils and welts to appear, manipulating the life-forces of others, creating tumors, curing the Legacy Virus,X-Force vol. 3 #10 causing death, and cleansing the body of drugs.X-Force vol. 3 #3 and later after his powers were expanded radically he can even cure the M-Pox. The Stepford Cuckoos telepathically copied and transferred the Beast's knowledge of anatomy, biology, and genetics into Josh's mind, allowing him the knowledge to heal virtually any malady.New X-Men #38 Because of his control over his own biology, Elixir has proven to be very difficult to treat medically.New X-Men vol. 2 #28 He usually passes out after pushing his powers too far and remains in a coma for some time. Elixir is also virtually immortal as although he can be killed, his powers grant him the ability to resurrect himself, as well as the ability to be reborn into a new body. He can even regenerate on a cellular level. Since his rebirth, Elixir's powers evolved to the point of bring people back from dead as seen as when he was able to affect the 16 million deceased mutants on Genosha at once, and although it quickly drained him out of energy and he passed out, Monet and Magneto speculated, that Elixir was fully capable of resurrecting them all but at the cost of his sanity. He is also able to detect abnormalities in living beings: he detected techo-organic cells in Angel's body, detected Emplate in Monet's body and even sensed the effect of magical inversion on Sabretooth. When Josh started to cure the M-Pox he felt that the disease was afraid of him. Other versions =New X-Men: Too Much Information= When David learns of a mental block within his head that prevents him from keeping the information he absorbs permanently, he asks for Emma Frost's aid in removing it. Working with Dani Moonstar, they show David a possible future outcome because of the mental blocks' removal. After leaving the Xavier Institute, David promises to help Josh find the full potential of his powers. Months later after establishing his own business, Josh is used to create a cure to both cancer and AIDS. Although successful, it comes at the cost of his life.New X-Men: Academy X #10 =House of M= In the House of M reality, Josh was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., serving alongside Agent Kevin Ford (Wither) as interrogator. Foley and Ford were in charge of \\"persuading\\" Cameron Hodge, a member of the Human Liberation Front, to reveal the location of his terrorist cell. Josh uses his power to \\"speed up the body's biological functions,\\" and combined with Agent Ford's power, they are able to create a net effect that causes a part of the terrorist to die and then regenerate, which Foley describes as \\"quite painful\\". Before Ford and Foley begin torturing Hodge, Agent Noriko Ashida (Surge) interrupts them, prompting Ford and Foley to attack her. She incapacitates them both but Foley manages to use his power to rupture her blood vessels and cause her lungs to fill with blood.

Manufactured by S&S; Power, Mailboomer was a Space Shot attraction, meaning it launched guests from the bottom of the tower instead of slowly lifting them to the top and dropping them from there. The ride was pneumatically powered, with three connected towers, each with its own independent ride system. It also contained \\"Scream Shields\\", used to block the screams from reaching residents of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove as the park is located near a residential area. The concept of the Maliboomer came from a space-themed version of the High striker attraction on many boardwalks and carnivals. The Maliboomer name also hinted at this theme, since it alludes to the beach town of Malibu, California. As part of the park's multi-year, $1.1 billion expansion, the Maliboomer was originally planned to be remodeled, but it was later announced that the ride would not survive the park's expansion. The ride's last operating day was September 7, 2010 and the dismantling of the attraction began shortly afterwards. The ride was then moved to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk On June 28, 2019, the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind attraction, inspired by Disney¬∑Pixar's Inside Out, opened in the space where the Maliboomer once stood.

The organization's founder and current president is Frank Gaffney Jr. who is known for promoting falsehoods about President Barack Obama being a Muslim. History and programs In April 1987, Frank Gaffney, Jr. was nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs during the Reagan Administration. He served in that role for seven months until was forced from his post in November of that year. In a meeting with former Department of Defense officials after Gaffney's ouster, Richard Perle, for whom Gaffney had previously served as a top deputy, said, \\"What we need is the Domino‚Äôs Pizza of the policy business. ... If you don‚Äôt get your policy analysis in 30 minutes, you get your money back.\\" Gaffney founded the CSP a year later in 1988. One of the center's annual reports later echoed Perle's words calling the CSP \\"the Domino's Pizza of the policy business.\\" In 2010, James Woolsey and Joseph E. Schmitz co-authored a CSP report that claimed sharia law was a major threat to the national security of the United States. In 2012, Gaffney released a 50-page document titled, \\"The Muslim Brotherhood in the Obama Administration\\". The document questioned the Obama administration‚Äôs approach to the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East. The CSP has since accused a number of US officials of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, including Huma Abedin and Grover Norquist. In 2013, CSP received donations from Boeing ($25,000); General Dynamics ($15,000); Lockheed Martin ($15,000); Northrup Grumman ($5,000); Raytheon ($20,000); and General Electric ($5,000). The group has also received $1.4 million from the Bradley Foundation. The CSP helped to organize a rally on Capitol Hill on September 9, 2015 against the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump spoke at the rally. In a separate report about Iran, the CSP declared that Susan Rice, Richard Haass, and Dennis Ross were being secretly controlled by a covert \\"Iran lobby\\". On March 16, 2016, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced he would appoint Gaffney to be his National Security Advisor. Cruz also said his foreign policy team would also include three other employees of Gaffney's think tank: Fred Fleitz, Clare Lopez, and Jim Hanson. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump cited a widely debunked CSP poll in support of his call to ban Muslims from the United States. =Trump administration= Since 2017 several people with ties to the CSP have joined the Trump administration, including Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway in 2017, chief of staff for the National Security Council Fred Fleitz in 2018, and Deputy National Security Advisor Charles Kupperman in 2019. Kupperman served on the board of directors for CSP between 2001 and 2010. The Trump administration used reports released by the CSP when it proposed to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Controversy The Center and Gaffney have been criticized for propagating conspiracy theories by Dana Milbank of The Washington Post, Simon Maloy of Salon, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen, Grover Norquist, Jonathan Kay, Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim‚ÄìChristian Understanding, Center for American Progress, Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center, The Intercept, the Anti-Defamation League,Anti-Defamation League (March 2011) \\"Stop Islamization of America (SIOA)\\" and the Institute for Southern Studies, among others. In 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) labeled the CSP as a hate group and a \\"conspiracy-oriented mouthpiece for the growing anti- Muslim movement\\", a characterization disputed by the CSP. SPLC representatives have characterized the CSP as \\"an extremist think tank\\" and suggested that it is led by an \\"anti-muslim conspiracy theorist.\\" The SPLC further criticizes CSP's \\"investigative reports\\", saying that they are designed \\"to reinforce [Frank] Gaffney's delusions\\". One of the CSP's \\"Occasional Papers\\" accused Huma Abedin, then Hillary Clinton's aide, of being an undercover spy for the Muslim Brotherhood. On June 13, 2012, Republican members of Congress Michele Bachmann, Trent Franks, Louie Gohmert, Thomas Rooney and Lynn Westmoreland, sent a letter to the State Department Inspector General including accusations against Abedin cited to the CSP. The letter and the CSP's accusation were widely denounced as a smear, and achieved \\"near-universal condemnation\\", including from several prominent Republicans such as John McCain, John Boehner, Scott Brown, and Marco Rubio. Writing in Religion Dispatches, Sarah Posner described the organization as \\"a far-right think tank whose president, Frank Gaffney, was banned from the CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] ... because its organizers believed him to be a 'crazy bigot'\\". The Center for Democratic Values at Queens College, City University of New York has said the center is among the \\"key players in the Sharƒ´ øah cottage industry\\", which it describes as a \\"conspiracy theory\\" that claims the existence of \\"secretive power elite groups that conspire to replace sovereign nation-states in order to eventually rule the world\\".The Michael Harrington Center for Democratic Values and Social Action \\"Action Brief\\" (April 2011) In March 1995, William M. Arkin, a reporter and commentator on military affairs, criticized the CSP's Gaffney as a \\"maestro of bumper-sticker policy\\" who \\"specializes in intensely personal attacks\\" and who has \\"never met a flag- waving, pro-defense, anti-Democratic idea he didn't like.\\" Gaffney has also generated controversy for writing in 2010 that the logo of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency \\"appears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with the Obama campaign logo\\" and was part of a \\"worrying pattern of official U.S. submission to Islam\\".

It is a sub-prefecture and third-most important city and economic center in the department. It is situated on the river Aisne, near the northern border of Champagne and 37 km from Reims. Its inhabitants are called Reth√©lois. History According to legend, the city was founded by Julius Caesar, who established a camp on the site of the city during his campaigns. The parents of St. Arnulf of Metz were said to have given all they owned in villa Reistete (in the city of Rethel) to St. Remigius, bishop of Reims, so that their prayers for a child would be answered. The city belonged to the Abbey of Saint-Remi and was administered by its advocati. One of them, Manasses I, became the first Count of Rethel. In 1481 the county, with Rethel as its seat, was elevated to the Peerage of France; it was elevated to a duchy in 1581 and in 1663 it became the Duchy of Mazarin. During the Franco-Spanish War it was captured by Spanish forces under Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond√© on October 30, 1652 after a four-year siege, but was retaken by the French in July 1653. In 1814 Spanish prisoners of war from the Napoleonic Wars introduced typhus to the city. Jean-Baptiste Reberotte-Labesse cared for the soldiers who were ill. Cholera epidemics occurred in 1832 and 1849, while typhoid fever ravaged the city in 1839, with an average of thirty deaths a day. During World War II Rethel was the site of heavy combat from May to June 1940 during the Battle of France. French troops under Jean de Lattre de Tassigny repelled German assaults on the town for a month before it fell.

They have also had a working agreement with the Houston Aeros of the AHL for the 04‚Äì05 season. On June 23, 2008, the ECHL announced that it had terminated the Ice Pilots' membership, effective immediately. The team's colors (navy blue and gold) and nickname were a tribute to the long history of Naval aviation in Pensacola (Naval Air Station Pensacola is home to the legendary Blue Angels and the National Museum of Naval Aviation). The home of the Pensacola Ice Pilots was the Pensacola Civic Center, which was referred to as \\"The Hangar\\", and has a capacity of 8,150.

The Ice Pilots advanced to their only Kelly Cup appearance against the Hampton Roads Admirals. The Ice Pilots took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Kelly Cup Final. But a scheduling conflict at the Norfolk Scope, the Admirals' home arena, forced a delay of nine days between Games 3 and 4. The Ice Pilots elected to stay in Virginia, rather than return to Pensacola for the week. The Admirals won Games 4 and 5 at home, then clinched the series in Game 6, in Pensacola. * The 2004‚Äì2005 Pensacola Ice Pilots won the Brabham Cup for the most points overall in the league during the regular season. =Players= * Glen Metropolit played 54 games for Pensacola in 1996-97 and scored 82 points.

The ECHL then stated that it would revoke the franchise if need be, and the ECHL made it official on Monday, June 23, 2008.http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3665989 On April 4, 2009, the SPHL announced discussions between potential investors, key government officials, local fans and business leaders in Pensacola, Florida relative to the award of a franchise for the 2009-10 SPHL season.

Celldweller songs have been featured in many films, movie trailers, television shows and video games. Career =Precursors: Circle of Dust and Angeldust (1992‚Äì1999)= The name Celldweller was derived from a nickname his mother gave him when he was a teenager, dubbed \\"Cellar Dweller\\", as he made all of his music in his parents' basement. Klayton had gained a devoted cult following in the mid 90s because of his industrial metal band Circle of Dust. After the dissolution of Circle of Dust, Klayton concurrently released both a posthumous collection of reworked Circle of Dust leftovers titled Disengage and an album for a new project, Angeldust, created in conjunction with illusionist Criss Angel. Both albums demonstrated Klayton's shift away from industrial metal and towards more electronic-modern industrial rock influences, incorporating richer electronic instrumentation and greater emphasis on melody. This change in style was a major step toward the sound that would come to define Celldweller's output. Klayton began creating songs for the Celldweller project in 1998/1999 and released a limited edition EP of three early Celldweller demos and two solo trance tracks, which quickly sold out. Klayton and Criss Angel parted ways in 2000 after three albums' worth of material had been completed, allowing Klayton to devote all of his time to Celldweller. =Eponymous debut period (1999‚Äì2004)= Official Celldweller \\"cell-block\\" logo Klayton worked in earnest with producer Grant Mohrman (formerly of Leaderdogs for the Blind) on the debut Celldweller album, which was slated for release in February 2001. Unfortunately, various delays kept pushing the release date back. During this time, Klayton kept fans up to date with numerous Celldweller Logs through his website and via email and, in 2001, released raw files of the song \\"Symbiont\\" to give fans and fellow musicians a chance to remix Celldweller's music. Eight remixes were chosen and uploaded to the original Mp3.com, most of them making it to the top of the Electronic and the Electro-Industrial charts. All the exposure led to over 500,000 song plays on Mp3.com. The \\"Symbiont\\" remixes became a digital EP six years later. The self-titled debut album saw release in early 2003 and debuted at No. 17 on Billboard's Internet Sales Chart.[ Celldweller ranking at Billboard] Celldweller included a guest appearance by Taproot drummer Jarrod Montague. In 2004, the album took home seven awards at the Just Plain Folks Music Awards, winning Album of the Year, Producer of the Year, Industrial Album of the Year, Metal Song of the Year (\\"One Good Reason\\") and Best Industrial Rock Song (\\"Switchback\\"), and also took runner-up in Best Industrial Song with \\"Stay with Me (Unlikely)\\" and Best Rock Song with \\"I Believe You\\". Later, the songs \\"Birthright\\" and \\"Switchback\\" were included in the list of Hard and Extreme Mode songs respectively for the popular iPhone OS game Tap Tap Revenge. In 2004, Klayton put together a double disc release called The Beta Cessions. The first disc contained a re-recording of the last Circle of Dust song, \\"Goodbye\\", alternate mixes of \\"Switchback\\", the Klayton tracks from the initial Celldweller EP, and demo versions of debut Celldweller songs. The second disc contained the full debut album in instrumental form, with a few of the instrumentals being slightly edited. Klayton stated that he plans to release Beta Cessions to coincide with each of his major albums to collect outtakes, demos, and other rarities. In the years following the release of the first Celldweller album, various remix EPs were released, culminating in the conception of the Take It & Break It Celldweller Remix Competition in 2006. Expanded off the fan remix concept that Klayton first toyed with in 2001 with the Symbiont remixes, the Take It & Break It competition saw the creation of its own website on which unlimited numbers of fans could register, download and remix the individual recording files of various Celldweller songs, and then submit their remixes. Three rounds of the competition were completed, with compilations of Celldweller remixes being released at the end of each round. In 2008, the Celldweller Remix Competition evolved into the FiXT Remix Competition where fans, remixers, and musicians have the opportunity to remix songs of not only Celldweller but other FiXT Music artists as well. In December 2008, Klayton released Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 01, a collection consisting primarily of short, instrumental score-based compositions. He selected and reworked demos from his extensive archives that he felt would suit for film, TV and video game licensing. Additionally, some songs were from the (then work in progress) second main Celldweller album sessions.Celldweller - The Best It's Gonna Get Beta Cessions Commentary (Wish Upon a Blackstar Chapter 02 Deluxe Edition) Celldweller's management has sought to have these songs placed in media, like those on the debut album, and several have already been heard on film and television and in video games. =Wish Upon a Blackstar period (2004‚Äì2012)= Writing and recording for the second Celldweller album has been underway since 2004. Originally slated to come out in the summer of 2006, the album has been delayed numerous times. In March 2009, Klayton announced that the title of the album is Wish Upon a Blackstar. Of 50 songs, he has narrowed it down to the 10 that will comprise the album. In a blog post on his website, he elaborated on wanting to release the album in \\"Chapters\\" with each Chapter consisting of two songs. In April 2009, Klayton revealed the tracks Wish Upon a Blackstar would contain, and has also stated that many of the leftovers will be on the second volume of The Beta Cessions. Textlogo During the recording of Wish Upon a Blackstar, Klayton also began work on his follow-up to Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 01 (SVH). Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 02 will be released in the same manner as Wish Upon a Blackstar: as handfuls of tracks are completed, Chapters of the full album will be released digitally until the full collection is complete and the album is released on physical media. Chapter 01 of SVH Vol. 02 featured four songs, including a 20-minute ambient piece titled \\"Adrift on Celestial Seas\\" (a first for Celldweller). Additionally, a Limited Edition CD of Chapter 01 was released on December 7, 2010 that contained a bonus short ambient track, \\"Distants\\". In addition to working on Wish Upon a Blackstar and SVH Vol. 02, Celldweller kept busy on other fronts. He produced the remainder of the debut Blue Stahli album, appeared on the soundtrack of the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 game Dead Rising 2 with a new original song, \\"Kill the Sound\\", as well as a selection of previously released Celldweller songs, and also remixed songs for BT and JES. Klayton confirmed in April 2010 that, for the first time in five years, he would be taking Celldweller on the road. The live band would consist of Klayton and fellow FiXT recording artist Blue Stahli. The first leg of the tour, in the fall of 2010, included shows at Triton Fest in New York City, Dragoncon in Atlanta, Georgia, and EBM Fest in Toronto. In November 2010, Klayton announced that he is planning to release studio recordings of the alternate live versions of Celldweller songs played on the tour. The first of these releases, Cellout EP 01, is available as an iTunes exclusive, released on January 25, 2011. On May 4, 2011, a four-EP bundle was released via Groupees in a 72-hour only exclusive online sale with 20% of the benefits going to Red Cross for Tornado Relief. The EPs in the promotion were Cellout EP 01, Chapter 01 of Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head Vol. 02, Chapter 03 of Wish Upon a Blackstar and the Unreleased EP which contained previously unreleased songs and remixes including a song titled \\"Senorita Bonita\\" from the Chapter 02 of SVH Vol. 02 and a Beta Cessions demo, \\"Atmospheric Light\\". In May 2011, in a Ustream broadcast Klayton mentioned that he was planning to launch a Celldweller VIP Membership, which would give \\"access to unreleased demos, video, news, discounts & more\\". It was to be launched in \\"early/mid July\\", 2011. On November 24, 2011, Klayton announced that he is planning to release Wish Upon a Blackstar on March 27, 2012.

Cape Palliser and Lighthouse A small settlement - Ngawi - is situated near Cape Palliser, where the main income comes from crayfish (southern rock lobster) fishing. Fishing boats are pushed into the sea on their trailers by bulldozers. Kupe's Sail is another feature of Cape Palliser - a triangular upthrust of sedimentary rock shaped like a sail. Maori history and the Kupe legend both feature Cape Palliser. Cape Palliser was named in 1770 by Captain James Cook in honour of his friend Admiral Sir Hugh Palliser of the British Royal Navy.

The character of Blinky first appeared in Brooke Nicholls' 1933 book, Jacko ‚Äì the Broadcasting Kookaburra, which was illustrated by Wall. Wall then featured Blinky Bill in a series of her own books, including Blinky Bill: The Quaint Little Australian, Blinky Bill Grows Up, and Blinky Bill and Nutsy. The books are considered quintessential Australian children's classics, and have never been out of print in Australia. Themes and writing style While telling the adventures of Blinky Bill, a cheeky little boy in the form of a koala, the stories also present messages of conservation. Blinky Bill is known for his mischievousness and his love for his mother. His friends include his step-sister Nutsy, his kangaroo friend Splodge, his platypus friend Flap, Marcia the marsupial mouse, and his mentor Mr Wombat or Wombo, as Blinky prefers to call him. In general, throughout the stories, he does things that are realistic for koalas as well as things that child readers would like to do. Wall tells the stories directly to the children and Blinky often interacts with the readers in an introduction. Her dedications are often to 'All the Kind Children', with her own son Peter and other common Australian names of the 1930s appearing. The books are also fully illustrated by Dorothy Wall herself. History The first book Blinky Bill: The Quaint Little Australian was published in 1933 by Angus & Robertson and was based on stories told to her only child, Peter. The book is 69 pages long, with 15 pages of illustrations. The second book, Blinky Bill Grows Up, was published in 1934 and is 82 pages long with 16 pages of illustrations. The third book Blinky Bill and Nutsy: Two Little Australians was published in 1937 and is 115 pages long. The Complete Adventures of Blinky Bill, first published in 1939, was reprinted 26 times between 1940 and 1965. Blinky Bill's father illustration Wall drew Blinky Bill comic strips, most notably one in 1937 called Blinky Bill's Escapades, which told of the adventures of Blinky, Nutsy and Splodge as they left Australia for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Angus & Robertson made plates of four strips to entice publishers, but, after considerable procrastination, the Sydney Morning Herald turned it down. She persisted with the Herald for years along with the Sunday Telegraph. Wall also drew some full-page strips, in full colour, of Blinky Bill, Splodge and friends in the army, called Our Squad. Largely because of the cost and rarity of paper during the war, none was ever published. In 1940, Wall decided her priority was a new Blinky Bill book with Angus & Robertson. In a letter to her publisher, she wrote: \\"I'll have to do my utmost to get a new Blinky book out for next Christmas. I could do a good story with Blinky on National Service, providing the war continues ‚Äì but I am not that wicked to wish such a thing\\". In February 1940 she sent her publisher the completed text for Blinky Bill Joins the Army. The publisher was unimpressed by her story of Blinky as an enlisted soldier, calling it 'heavy going' and a too obvious exploitation of 'patriotic fervour'. Wall apparently tore up the manuscript and wrote an entirely new version where Blinky remains in his familiar bush setting until the final pages then goes off to join the army ‚Äì as a mascot. The new version was finished by the end of April 1940, less than a month after the first had been rejected; it was published for Christmas 1940. In December 1942 the Blinky Bill's Dress-Up Book was published by Offset Printing Company, which was released after Wall's death, in January 1942. This was followed in 1947 by Blinky Bill's ABC Book and A Tiny Story of Blinky Bill, also published by Offset. In 1977 Angus & Robertson published the Blinky Bill Cookbook, a series of recipes for children to make for themselves by Mary Coleman, which included Wall's original illustrations redrawn by Trevor Hood. Adaptations and cultural references Although the books have never been out of print, the Blinky Bill story has also been adapted for television and cinema. The first television series from the 1980s, screened on the ABC was a live version featured actors interacting with puppet animals, titled The New Adventures of Blinky Bill. Blinky Bill was also made into an animated movie, Blinky Bill: The Mischievous Koala, by Yoram Gross Film Studios in 1992. In 1993 there was a second children's series on the ABC Kids channel, called The Adventures of Blinky Bill. Computer games have been based on the Blinky Bill franchise, and these have been moderately successful. In the 1980s Anne Keane gained the rights to reproduce both Dorothy Wall's Blinky Bill characters and the characters from Jimmy Bancks' Ginger Meggs comics. She made a series of collectable dolls, with ceramic heads and feet with soft bodies made from imitation suede. Blinky Bill is also the nickname of the light at the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge. In 1985 a postage stamp honouring Blinky or his creator was issued by Australia Post as part of a set of five commemorating children's books. . In 1986, Australian singer John Williamson released a single titled \\"Goodbye Blinky Bill\\" raising awareness of decline in koala numbers in Australia. In 1993, The Australian republican movement used the character as a symbol in the referendum the following year. A new Blinky Bill CGI film, Blinky Bill the Movie, was released on 17 September 2015. It was followed by a TV series The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill that began airing in 2016 on Seven Network. Reception Blinky Bill received critical acclaim, and has become a national icon for Australia. Both the books and TV series are recognised internationally and regarded as children's classics.

A neutral antagonist has no activity in the absence of an agonist or inverse agonist but can block the activity of either. Inverse agonists have opposite actions to those of agonists but the effects of both of these can be blocked by antagonists. A prerequisite for an inverse agonist response is that the receptor must have a constitutive (also known as intrinsic or basal) level of activity in the absence of any ligand. An agonist increases the activity of a receptor above its basal level, whereas an inverse agonist decreases the activity below the basal level. The efficacy of a full agonist is by definition 100%, a neutral antagonist has 0% efficacy, and an inverse agonist has < 0% (i.e., negative) efficacy. Examples Receptors for which inverse agonists have been identified include the GABAA, melanocortin, mu opioid, histamine and beta adrenergic receptors. Both endogenous and exogenous inverse agonists have been identified, as have drugs at ligand gated ion channels and at G protein-coupled receptors. = Ligand gated ion channel inverse agonists = An example of a receptor site that possesses basal activity and for which inverse agonists have been identified is the GABAA receptors. Agonists for GABAA receptors (such as muscimol) create a relaxant effect, whereas inverse agonists have agitation effects (for example, Ro15-4513) or even convulsive and anxiogenic effects (certain beta- carbolines). = G protein-coupled receptor inverse agonists = Two known endogenous inverse agonists are the Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and its associated peptide Agouti signalling peptide (ASIP). AgRP and ASIP appear naturally in humans and bind melanocortin receptors 4 and 1 (Mc4R and Mc1R), respectively, with nanomolar affinities. The opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are also partial inverse agonists at mu opioid receptors. Nearly all antihistamines acting at H1 receptors and H2 receptors have been shown to be inverse agonists. The beta blockers carvedilol and bucindolol have been shown to be low level inverse agonists at beta adrenoceptors.

The lake covers an area of , and at its deepest is . The lake is the third largest in the North Island, fractionally smaller than Lake Rotorua. The nearest town to the lake is Featherston, which is located five kilometres from its northern shore.The lake forms part of the Wairarapa Moana Wetlands Park. The lake's catchment area is large, and includes the eastern slopes of the Remutaka and Tararua Ranges. The lake takes water from several rivers and was originally the main outflow for the Ruamahanga. This in turn drained slowly into Palliser Bay and Cook Strait ten kilometres south near the settlement of Lake Ferry, via what is now Lake Onoke. The river, however, was diverted in the 1960s to assist flow, thereby reducing flooding for farmers. The lake today therefore covers an area significantly smaller than its historical size of around 210 km¬≤.Flack, J: Wairarapa Times Age, Feb 2000. The area around the lake is low-lying and swampy, and recent efforts have been made to preserve its important wetland features and restore wildlife habitat that has been degraded through human use. Agriculture and river development, flood control, and waterway diversions have resulted in the drainage of large areas of the wetlands, reducing their ecological values.NZ Department of Conservation Lake Wairarapa is classed as supertrophic on the trophic level index, meaning that it is highly polluted with nitrates which leach from intensified agriculture surrounding the lake. This is in line with the wider trend of agriculture polluting New Zealand rivers and lakes. The lake has long been used by MƒÅori as a source of readily available food, and many species of waterfowl and fish uncommon elsewhere in New Zealand can be found in or around the lake.

A Bunco is achieved when a person rolls three-of-a-kind and all three numbers match the round number. History Bunco was originally a confidence game similar to three card monte.Slang and Its Analogues Past and Present - 1890Our Rival, the Rascal - 1897 It originated in 19th-century England where it was known as \\"eight dice cloth\\".Professional Criminals of America - 1886 It was imported to San Francisco as a gambling activity in 1855, where it gave its name to gambling parlors, or \\"Bunco parlors\\", and more generally to any swindle. After the Civil War the game evolved to a popular parlor game. During the 1920s and Prohibition, Bunco was re-popularized as a gambling game, often associated with a speakeasy. Law-enforcement groups raiding these parlors came to be known as \\"Bunco squads\\". Bunco as a family game saw a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s.Bunco history World Bunco Association official site. Retrieved 19 January 2010 Rules Widely recognized standards are: Each game consists of six rounds, progressing in order from one to six. For the first round, players divide into numbered tables of four players each, starting with a Head Table (sometimes called the \\"Queen's Table\\"), then a Table 2, Table 3, etc. At each table players pair up into two teams. Play usually starts with a signal from the Head Table. When play has started, players take turns rolling three dice trying to score points. Points are usually awarded as such: 21 points if all three dice match the current round number (a \\"Bunco\\"); 5 points are awarded if all three dice match each other, but do not match the current round number (This is called a ‚ÄúBonko‚Äù). Finally, 1 point may be awarded for each die matching the current round number. If points are scored, the player gets to roll again, continuing to add to their score. If no points are awarded, the player's turn ends and the dice are passed to the next player at the table. Each round ends when a team or a player (depending on local rules) at the Head Table has scored 21 points. After each round has ended, players stand up and the winning team from each table moves up, while the losing team stays put. For the Head Table, instead of the losing team staying, the losing team moves down to the lowest table. In other variations, the winning team may move up, and the losing team move down rather than staying where they are. After everyone has moved tables, play starts with the next round, until all rounds have been completed and the game is finished. After the game is over, round wins, losses, buncos, total points scored, etc., can be compared to determine a winner or award prizes. Renewed popularity According to the World Bunco Association the game had seen a resurgence in popularity in the United States in the early 21st century; in 2006, it was claimed that during the previous year \\"over 59 million women have played Bunco and over 27 million play regularly\\". As it is played today, bunco is a social dice game involving 100% luck and no skill (there are no decisions to be made), scoring and a simple set of rules. Members of a Bunco club take turns hosting, providing snacks, refreshments and the tables to set up the games. The host/hostess may also provide a door prize. Small amounts of money can be involved as well. The object of the game is to accumulate points and to roll certain combinations. The winners get prizes (provided by the host/hostess or pooled from the club resources) for accomplishments such as the highest score, the lowest score, or the most buncos. Prizes frequently center on themes associated with the game such as fancy dice, dice embedded in soap, T-shirts featuring illustrations of dice, etc. Bunco fundraisers have become increasingly popular over the years, earning large sums for a wide variety of charities. Large groups of bunco players have come together to support their favorite charities by paying an entry fee into the game, holding silent auctions, and by selling raffle tickets; with all proceeds from the event donated to the cause.Buncogameshop.com According to The Washington Post, Bunco is sometimes referred to as the housewife's drinking game. Variations =Bunco on Facebook or other social networks= Bunco on Facebook or other social networks usually differs from traditional land based bunco games. Players may join and play online with people from all over the world. Players may be able to join or leave at any time rather than having to plan with a group in advance. Games may feature 'power-ups' which accelerate player's advancement within the game or give players an advantage scoring points. Players can also collect, buy and share virtual items with friends on the Facebook platform. This adds to the community element which is otherwise not experienced in other forms of land-based bunco.

This record has since been surpassed by Bronwyn Bishop. She was the first woman member of the parliament to have served in both houses.Dr Joy McCann and Janet Wilson (7 March 2012): Representation of women in Australian parliaments, Australian Parliamentary Library. Early life Sullivan was born Kathryn Jean Martin on 8 March 1942 in Brisbane, Queensland. She was the second of two daughters born to Edna (n√©e Sproul) and Ian Martin. Her mother was a nurse and post office worker and her father was a bank officer. She grew up in country Queensland, attending primary schools in Mount Morgan, Kingaroy, Humpybong, and Camp Hill. Her secondary education was completed at Somerville House in Brisbane. She went on to complete a Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) degree in political science at the University of Queensland. Politics Martin joined the Young Liberals in 1960 during her first year at university. She served as state secretary in 1961 and vice-president in 1963, and had received life membership by the time she graduated. =Senate (1974‚Äì1984)= Martin was elected to the Senate at the 1974 federal election, a double dissolution. She was ranked in fifth position on the joint ticket with the Country Party. In April 1975, Martin was chosen as the Liberal Party's assistant whip in the Senate. She was \\"a linchpin in keeping the Opposition senators in line\\" during the 1975 constitutional crisis, and retained the position after the Coalition won the 1975 federal election. She resigned as assistant whip in February 1977 after crossing the floor with nine other Liberal senators to oppose a procedural motion to expedite the government's constitutional amendment bills. Martin subsequently led the \\"No\\" campaign in Queensland against the simultaneous elections amendment, which was the only one of four not to pass. Her relationship with Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser deteriorated as a result and \\"destroyed her prospects for promotion while he remained party leader\\". Prior to the 1983 election, Martin offered to resign her place on the Liberal Senate ticket in favour of Neville Bonner, who had been demoted to the third position. Her offer was rejected and Bonner unsuccessfully stood as an independent. In the last years of the Fraser Government she had increasingly aligned herself with opposition to Fraser's leadership, supporting Andrew Peacock for the party leadership. Fraser resigned as leader after losing the 1983 election and was replaced by Peacock, who appointed Martin as Shadow Minister for Home Affairs and Administrative Services. She resigned from the Senate in November 1984 to seek a lower-house seat at the upcoming federal election, which followed an expansion in the number of House of Representatives seats. After her marriage the previous year she was known as Kathy Sullivan or Kathy Martin Sullivan. =House of Representatives (1984‚Äì2001)= At the 1984 election, Sullivan won the newly created Division of Moncrieff for the Liberal Party. She was the first woman to serve in both houses of federal parliament. She was also the first female Coalition MP to serve in the House since Kay Brownbill in 1969. Sullivan was not retained in Andrew Peacock's shadow ministry after the 1984 election. She returned as a shadow parliamentary secretary in 1993 under John Hewson, holding the position until Hewson lost the leadership the following year. She returned to her former position as a deputy whip later in 1994, holding the position until the 1996 election. Sullivan hoped to become Speaker of the House of Representatives when the Coalition won the 1996 federal election, but was defeated by Bob Halverson in an internal ballot. She was instead elected to the speaker's panel. Following a ministerial reshuffle, Sullivan was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in October 1997. She held the position until February 2000 when she announced her decision not to re-contest her seat at the 2001 federal election. She has been a vocal advocate for an increase in the number of women in parliament.Senate vacancy Recognition  In 2003, she was made a Member of the Order of Australia, for service to the Parliament of Australia and to the community, particularly as an advocate for improved services and conditions affecting women.SULLIVAN, Kathy, It's an Honour, 2003.

He is Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan. Since 2002, he has written a weblog, Informed Comment (juancole.com).  Background and education  Cole was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His father served in the United States Army Signal Corps. When Cole was age two, his family left New Mexico for France. His father completed two tours with the U.S. military in France (a total of seven years) and one 18-month stay at Kagnew Station in Asmara, Eritrea (then Ethiopia). (Cole reports that he first became interested in Islam in Eritrea, which has a population roughly half Christian and half Muslim.) Cole was schooled at twelve schools in twelve years, at a series of dependent schools on military bases but also sometimes in civilian schools. Some schooling occurred in the United States, particularly in North Carolina and California. Cole obtained his undergraduate degree at Northwestern University in 1975, having majored in History and Literature of Religions. For two quarters in his senior year he conducted a research project in Beirut, Lebanon and returned to the city as a graduate student in the fall of 1975, but the civil war prevented Cole from continuing his studies there. Therefore, he pursued a master's degree at the American University in Cairo in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, graduating in 1978. Cole then returned to Beirut for another year and worked as a translator for a newspaper. In 1979, Cole enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles as a doctoral student in the field of Islamic Studies, graduating in 1984. After graduation, Cole was appointed Assistant Professor of History at the University of Michigan where he became a full professor in 1995. Cole is from a mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, but was brought up a non-denominational Protestant on army bases. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, he became interested in Eastern religions, including Buddhism. Cole became a member of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in 1972 as an undergraduate at Northwestern, and the religion later became a focus of his academic research. He resigned from the faith in 1996 after disputes with Bah√° º√≠ leadership concerning the Bah√° º√≠ system of administration, particularly the requirement to review works by Bah√° º√≠ authors when writing about the religion. He later became uninterested in organized religion as a personal matter. Cole married Shahin Malik in Lahore in 1982. The couple has a son, Arman, born in 1987.  Appointments and awards  Cole was awarded Fulbright-Hays fellowships to India (1982) and to Egypt (1985‚Äì1986). In 1991 he held a National Endowment for the Humanities grant for the study of Shia Islam in Iran. From 1999 until 2004, Juan Cole was the editor of The International Journal of Middle East Studies. He has served in professional offices for the American Institute of Iranian Studies and on the editorial board of the journal Iranian Studies. He is a member of the Middle East Studies Association of North America, and served as the organization's president for 2006. In 2006, he received the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism administered by Hunter College.Faculty News and Awards , Department of History: University of Michigan, 2007 * 1975: B.A. History and Literature of Religions, Northwestern University * 1978: M.A. Arabic Studies/History, American University in Cairo * 1984: Ph.D. Islamic Studies, University of California Los Angeles * 1984-1990: Assistant Professor of History, University of Michigan * 1990-1995: Associate Professor of History, University of Michigan * 1992-1995: Director, Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies, University of Michigan * 1995-2007: Professor of History, University of Michigan * 2007-present: Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History, University of Michigan * 2009-2012: Director, Center for South Asian Studies, University of Michigan  Academic interests  Cole became interested in Islam and Arabic while a teenager living in Eritrea when his father was stationed there. He studied Arabic at Northwestern University, in Beirut, at the American University in Cairo, and at the University of California, Los Angeles; his study included classical historical, theological and philosophical texts and classical and modern literature. He speaks Arabic (Modern Standard as well as Lebanese and Egyptian dialects), Persian, and Urdu, and can read Ottoman Turkish. He also knows French, German and Spanish. =Modern Egypt= Among Cole's major academic specializations has been the history of modern Egypt, including Sunni Islam. His second monograph was on the nineteenth-century 'Urabi Revolt, and his fifth was on the French invasion and occupation of the country under Napoleon. Egypt was one focus of his Engaging the Muslim World (Palgrave, 2009). He has authored nearly a dozen major journal articles and book chapters on Egypt. =Shia Islam: Iran, Iraq and India= Modern Shia Islam has been a major preoccupation in Cole's scholarship. The Shia Crescent runs from Saudi Arabia to India, and Cole has written on various countries in this arc as well as on Islam in general, the secular history and politics of the region, and comparative studies. His first monograph was on the modern history of Shi'a Islam in North India. His fourth book was a treatment of modern Shi'i movements throughout South and Western Asia. He has published over two dozen journal articles and book chapters on modern Shia Islam. =Current affairs history= After September 11, 2001, Cole turned increasingly to writing on radical Muslim movements, the Iraq War, United States foreign policy, and the Iran crisis. His scholarship was influenced by his blog, \\"Informed Comment\\", founded in 2002. He has pioneered in the field of what he calls not \\"contemporary history\\" but \\"current affairs history\\". See also \\"The Case for Current Affairs History\\" =Khalil Gibran translations= Kahlil Gibran is a well-known Lebanese-American poet, essayist, and artist who wrote in Arabic as well as English. Cole has translated three volumes of his Arabic-language literary writings. One of these, Broken Wings (al-Ajnihah al-Mutakassira, 1912), is alleged to have been the first Arabic-language novel, and has early feminist themes, protesting against arranged marriage and religious corruption. =Global Americana Institute= After September 11, Cole founded the Global Americana Institute to translate works concerning the United States into Arabic. The first volume was selected works of Thomas Jefferson, translated for the first time into Arabic, and the second is a translation of a biography of Martin Luther King Jr. along with selected speeches and writings (scheduled for fall 2012). The Institute is partnering with Dar al-Saqi books in this series. Cole has successfully solicited contributions through his website to support the translations and publications. =Bah√° º√≠ studies= Cole converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in 1972, but later resigned in 1996 after conflicts with members of the Bah√° º√≠ administration who perceived him as extreme and threatened him with a Bah√° º√≠ version of excommunication. Cole went on to critically attack the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2000, describing a prominent Bah√° º√≠ as \\"inquisitor\\" and \\"bigot\\", and describing Bah√° º√≠ institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, and with financial irregularities. Soon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion. Before resigning, Cole had several works published through Bah√° º√≠ publishers and co- edited an online journal (Occasional Papers in the Shaykhi, Babi, and Baha'i Religions, associated with H-Bahai). Some of these were translations, including several \\"unofficial\\" scriptural translations, and two volumes by/about early Bah√° º√≠ theologian M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fadl.They are: Letters and Essays 1886-1913 (Rasa'il va Raqa'im) of M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani [tr. from Arabic and Persian] (Los Angeles: Kalimat Press, 1985); and Miracles and Metaphors (Ad-Durar al-bahiyyah) of M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani [tr. from the Arabic and annotated](Los Angeles: Kalimat Press, 1982). He has maintained much of this material, as well as other documents and links, online.  Journalism and media appearances  Cole's journalism is mainly in the form of commentary than reporting. From 2004 to 2009, Cole had a regular column at Salon. Since 2009, he has written semi-regularly for Truthdig and Tom Engelhardt's Tomdispatch.com. He has published op-eds on the Mideast at The Washington Post, Le Monde Diplomatique, The Guardian, the San Jose Mercury News, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Boston Review, The Nation, the Daily Star, Tikkun magazine Cole has been a regular guest on The NewsHour at the PBS, and has appeared widely on television shows such as Nightline, ABC Evening News, the Today Show, Anderson Cooper 360¬∞, Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer, Al Jazeera and CNN Headline News. Charlie Rose, Fareed Zakaria GPS, The Rachel Maddow Show, The Colbert Report, Democracy Now! and many others.Juan Cole, \\"Resume\\", http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/jcpers.htm With regard to radio, he has also been a frequent guest on National Public Radio and has been interviewed by Ian Masters (KPFK), and has been interviewed by Terry Gross (\\"Fresh Air\\") and Diane Rehm, among many others. Cole was occasionally cited in the press as a Middle East expert in the 1990s.See, for example, Melinda Beck, et al., \\"The Case Against War\\", Newsweek (29 October 1990) p. 24; \\"The Gulf War\\", Los Angeles Times (13 February 1991) p. 8; Scott Shane, \\"Muslim world suffers by actions of terrorists\\", The Baltimore Sun (23 August 1998) p. 1A; and Bill Schiller, \\"Locals tied to Al Jihad terror network\\" Toronto Star (21 October 2001) p. A10. He became much more prominent after 2002, when he began publishing his weblog.Curt Guyette, \\"The Blog of War\\", Metrotimes (25 August 2004). From 2002 onwards, Cole became a widely recognized public intellectual. Foreign Policy commented in 2004, \\"Cole's transformation into a public intellectual embodies many of the dynamics that have heightened the impact of the blogosphere. He wanted to publicize his expertise, and he did so by attracting attention from elite members of the blogosphere. As Cole made waves within the virtual world, others in the real world began to take notice\\".Daniel W. Drezner and Henry Farrell, \\"Web of Influence\\", Foreign Policy (November/December 2004). His focus has primarily been on Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt and the Arab Spring. He has also occasionally written or given interviews about Israel and the Palestinians. Informed Comment blog Since 2002, Cole has published the blog Informed Comment, covering \\"History, Middle East, South Asia, Religious Studies, and the War on Terror\\". Blog entries include comments on widely reported articles in Western media, summaries of important articles from Arabic and Israeli news sources, and letters and discussions with both critics and supporters. The blog has won various awards; as of April 2006 the most prominent is the 2005 James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism from Hunter College.\\"Cole Receives Aronson Award from Hunter College\\", Informed Comment, March 29, 2006. It has also received two 2004 Koufax Awards: the \\"Best Expert Blog\\" and the \\"Best Blog Post\\".Drum, Kevin. Koufax Awards, Washington Monthly blog, February 23, 2005. It has since dropped off the list, but Informed Comment has been ranked as the 99th most popular blog on the Internet by Technorati on October 21, 2006. Cole was a strong critic of the George W. Bush administration and is one of the most respected foreign policy commentators amongst left-wing bloggers.The Hotline: National Journal's Daily Briefing on Politics, Blogometer Profiles: Informed Comment , National Journal, October 2, 2006 The July 28, 2006 issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education featured a story on Cole's blog and its role in his career. Following essays by several academic bloggers, Cole was given a chance to respond to the question of whether academics should risk career advancement by blogging. He responded: > The question is whether Web-log commentary helps or damages an academic's > career. It is a shameful question. Intellectuals should not be worrying > about \\"careers\\", the tenured among us least of all. Despite the First > Amendment, which only really protects one from the government, most > Americans who speak out can face sanctions from other institutions in > society.

Chronicle of Higher Education: The > Chronicle Review 52:47 (28 July 2006) p. B6. In that same article, he was referred to as a public intellectual by associate professor of culture and communication at New York University Siva Vaidhyanathan. Dead link; no archive located.  Other activities  In 2004, the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations requested Cole's testimony at hearings to better understand the situation in Iraq.Juan Cole's Senate Testimony Brief, United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, April 20, 2004. Cole is an avid science fiction fan and has a strong personal interest in human rights issues.Juan Cole, Juan R. I. Cole: Personal Interests, \\"Juan R. I. Cole Home Page\\", University of Michigan website. Views Generally speaking, Cole approaches the Middle East and Western Asia from the point of view of anti-imperialism. Viewing the USA as a colonialist power, he sees it as defending the post-World War I \\"Sykes‚ÄìPicot/Balfour architecture\\" (described as \\"a colossal failure\\") against Arab nationalist or pan-Islamic challengers. These foundered for various reasons, especially \\"particularism\\". The U.S., like previous empires, seeks to take advantage of such internal rivalries in order to \\"divide and rule\\". Terrorism, he explains (after comparing several countries in the region), is the result of foreign occupation in combination with weak states. Cole tends to value multinational (and especially UN) initiatives over unilateral military ones.Cole, Juan, April, 2004, archive, Informed Comment. He favors multi-ethnic states over separatist movements. Given his background in the 1960s and 1970s religious counter-culture, he views Islam (along with other religions) as essentially good, but distorted by certain of its political appropriators (and critics).Cole, Juan, \\"Peace And Love In Quran List Of\\", Informed Comment, 03/12/2006. =Iran= Cole mastered Persian in the 1970s and 1980s and has written academically on Iran's early modern and modern history, including the Qajar period and the Islamic Republic from 1979. Cole supported the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and rued his succession by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He reports that in 2003, Iran (addressing the Bush administration through the Swiss embassy) proposed a comprehensive peace agreement, which Bush refused even to discuss. He wrote of Ahmadinejad in 2007: \\"I profoundly disagree with his characterization of Israel, which is a legitimate United Nations member state\\". He also considers Ahmadinejad's holocaust denial to be \\"monstrous\\". Cole viewed the 2009 Iranian presidential election as having been stolen by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Cole wrote numerous posts warning that the Bush administration was attempting to create a war with Iran. He suggested that sabre-rattling offered a way for two unpopular regimes to attract nationalistic support. Alternative website address. Retrieved 2011-11-28. He has also speculated that the Bush administration's objective in Iran was to control future supplies of oil and natural gas, while denying them to energy- hungry China and India. On the nuclear issue, Cole wrote in 2007 that \\"Iran is a good ten years away from having a bomb,\\" and points out that Ali Khamenei and other leaders have condemned nuclear weapons as un-Islamic. Cole also dismissed the Bush administration's allegation that Iran has supported terrorism in Iraq or Afghanistan, arguing rather that the United States had lent support to anti-Iranian terrorist groups such as the Kurdistan Free Life Party. Cole chastised several U.S. presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney, for making bellicose statements about Iran in order to present themselves in a tougher or more conservative light. He is a board member of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC). Ahmadinejad's remarks on Israel Cole and Christopher Hitchens traded barbs regarding the translation and meaning of a passage referring to Israel in a speech by Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Fathi Nazila of The New York Timess Tehran bureau translated the passage as \\"Our dear Imam [Khomeini] said that the occupying regime must be wiped off the map.\\" In an article published at the Slate website, Hitchens accused Cole of attempting to minimize and distort the meaning of the speech, which Hitchens understood to be a repetition of \\"the standard line\\" that \\"the state of Israel is illegitimate and must be obliterated.\\" Hitchens also denigrated Cole's competence in both Persian and \\"plain English\\" and described him as a Muslim apologist. Cole responded that while he personally despised \\"everything Ahmadinejad stands for, not to mention the odious Khomeini\\", he nonetheless objected to the New York Times translation. Cole wrote that it inaccurately suggested Ahmadinejad was advocating an invasion of Israel (\\"that he wants to play Hitler to Israel's Poland\\"). He added that a better translation of the phrase would be \\"the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time,\\" a metaphysical if not poetic reference rather than a militaristic one. He also stated that Hitchens was incompetent to assess a Persian-to-English translation, and accused him of unethically accessing private Cole e-mails from an on-line discussion group.News Hits staff, Juan up, Metro Times, 5/10/2006Joel Mowbray, Hatchet man or scholar?, The Washington Times, May 22, 2006 =Iraq= Cole was asked to address the pros and cons of the building war against Iraq in January 2003 for the journal of the University of Michigan International Institute. He wrote that any invasion of Iraq would inevitably be rejected by Iraqis and the Arab world as a form of neocolonialism. According to Cole: \\"The Sunnis of Iraq could well turn to groups like al- Qaida, having lost the ideals of the Baath. Iraqi Shi'ites might become easier to recruit into Khomeinism of the Iranian sort, and become a bulwark for the shaky regime in Shi'ite Iran.\\" Considering the problem of ethnic politics, he commented, \\"A post-war Iraq may well be riven with factionalism that impedes the development of a well-ensconced new government.\\" He rejected the argument that Baathist Iraq's \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" or backing of terrorism posed threats to the United States. Cole admitted that he had had \\"mixed feelings\\" on the issue‚Äîi.e., he opposed Saddam Hussein's regime, but feared disaster and opposed international illegality. He was insistent that any war would be illegal without a UN Security Council resolution (which was not obtained by the Bush administration). His position on the war resembled that of the French government, which is generally held to have opposed it. By January 2003, he said he had become \\"cynical\\" about the Bush administration motives for the war. On the day of the U.S. invasion, Cole wrote that \\"for all the concerns one might have about the aftermath, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the murderous Baath regime from power will be worth the sacrifices that are about to be made on all sides.\\" He has explained that this posting was not intended to show support for the invasion: \\"The passage quoted ... was not about whether the war was legal or not. Being from a military family, it mattered to me as an ethical issue whether troops lives were being lost for no good reason, in an illegal boondoggle. I decided on careful deliberation that even though the war was wrong, the lives lost would not be in vain, since a tyrannical regime would have fallen. To say that some good could come of an illegal act is not to endorse the illegal act.\\" Cole blamed the George W. Bush administration for creating what he calls a \\"failed state\\" in Iraq. He particularly cites its decision to disband the Iraqi Army, its treatment of prisoners, its alienation of neighboring countries, its corrupt economic policies, and long delays in organizing elections and forming a (weak) government. Bush's decision to invade Iraq, Cole wrote in 2005, resulted from a \\"coalition of disparate forces\\" within the Bush administration, \\"each with its own rationale\\" for going to war. He identifies: Bush's own \\"obsession with restoring family honor\\" slighted by Saddam Hussein's remaining in power after the Gulf War; Dick Cheney's interest in benefits to the oil industry (he cites \\"billions in no-bid contracts for [Halliburton]\\"‚Äîof which Cheney was CEO in the 1990s‚Äîand which \\"saved Halliburton from bankruptcy\\"); Cheney's \\"Manichaean, Cold War-inspired worldview‚Äîin which the U.S. battled an evil enemy\\"; Evangelical Christians who \\"wanted to missionize Iraq\\"; Karl Rove's wanting to \\"turn Bush into a war president\\" to ensure re-election; and neo- conservatives who hoped to transform the Middle East and remove what they perceived as a danger to Israel. The Bush administration's focus on purported weapons of mass destruction, he added, was an attempt to find a rationale acceptable to the public. Cole rejected the Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi cooperation with Al-Qaeda, commenting that Saddam Hussein had \\"persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number\\", as well as claims to the effect that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants. Cole, who began to call the Iraqi conflict a \\"civil war\\" as early as 2004, in 2007 stated that it consists of three distinct wars: \\"for control of Basra among Shiite militiamen; for control of Baghdad and its hinterlands between Sunnis and Shiites; and for control of Kirkuk among Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen.\\"\\"US Drawdown Begins Sadrists call for New Parliamentary Elections\\", Informed Comment, November 13, 2007. =Israel= Cole is a strong critic of Israel's foreign and military policy and its treatment of Palestinians. He criticizes the nature of America's support for Israel and the activities of the Israel Lobby, and claims that some senior US officials such as Douglas J. Feith have dual loyalties to America and the Likud party of Israel. Cole opposes boycotts of Israeli academics because he believes that the academic community in Israel is mostly opposed to the policies of Likud. =Al-Qaeda= Cole distinguishes \\"traditional\\" al-Qaeda from various 4-6 man cells scattered around the world who may identify with its goal, and use the name, but are not otherwise in contact with it. The former group consists of perhaps 5,000 members (\\"probably no more than a few hundred of them actually dangerous to the United States\\") whose activities \\"should be combatted by good police and counter-terrorism work\\". According to Cole, the Bush administration's view of \\"al-Qaeda\\" conflates various unrelated Muslim groups into a \\"bogeyman\\". As of 2006, there were \\"less than 1000\\" foreign (i.e., genuine) al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, although the Bush administration's actions have caused increasing numbers of Iraqi Sunnis to sympathize or identify with that organization. Alternative website address. Retrieved 2011-11-28. Such native sympathizers are referred to on his blog as \\"Salafi jihadis\\". Cole dismissed as \\"implausible\\" the prospect of such groups taking over Iraq. =Afghanistan= Cole calls the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan \\"the right war at the right time\\", and credits it with breaking up a network of al-Qaeda training camps which posed a danger to the U.S. Alternative website address. Retrieved 2011-11-28. Cole later criticized Bush for leaving the job half finished in Afghanistan to go off and fight in Iraq. Cole complains that Iraq has displaced Afghanistan from the public consciousness. \\"As for money, Iraq has hogged the lion's share,\\" he writes. \\"What has been spent on reconstruction in Afghanistan is piddling.\\" Talk of furthering democracy and women's rights, or eliminating opium poppy cultivation there, has all but evaporated. \\"Half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product now comes from poppy sales.\\" =Lebanon= Cole lived in Beirut for several years, and was present for part of the 1975‚Äì1976 civil war. His overview of 20th century Lebanese history blames the CIA for rigging elections there in 1957, in order to allow president Camille Chamoun a second term. (Chamoun had apparently persuaded Dwight D. Eisenhower that the Druze leaned towards Communism.) This had the effect of forcing pro-Nasser Arab nationalists outside the political process. Cole additionally blames the influx of 100,000 Palestinian refugees in 1948‚Äîand the various later military actions against them by Syria and Israel‚Äîfor the condition of Lebanese politics today. Cole often points out the incongruity of the U.S. allying itself with offshoots of the Islamic Dawa Party in Iraq but vehemently opposing Hezbollah in Lebanon. at Middle East Policy Council. During the 2006 Lebanon War, Cole accused both sides of committing \\"war crimes\\" against civilians. Cole stated that \\"[Israel has] every right to defend itself against Nasrallah and his mad bombers\\" while voicing disapproval for the \\"wholesale indiscriminate destruction and slaughter in which the Israelis have been engaged against the Lebanese in general\\". Cole also accused Israel of having planned the operation as much as a year in advance, rather than simply responding to provocation. =Pakistan= Cole opposed the Pervez Musharraf regime, which he blames for cracking down on democracy activists, while simultaneously allowing Islamists based in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) to consolidate and expand their political power. He points out that Musharraf is actually a \\"hawk\\" with respect to India (in contrast to the government of Nawaz Sharif, which had made overtures to it before the coup), and cancelled a special-forces operation aimed at killing Osama bin Laden. (The operation had been urged by President Bill Clinton, and if successful, might have prevented the September 11 attacks.) Cole also censures the George W. Bush administration for not pushing for democratization in Pakistan. Such a development would not threaten U.S. interests, he writes, since whenever elections have been held, Taliban-like movements have not received much support from voters. On the contrary, the danger is that U.S. support for Musharraf may alienate middle-class Pakistanis. Cole is also on the Editorial Board of Pakistaniaat. Cole's wife Shahin received her legal education in Lahore, Pakistan, and has also written against Musharraf's crackdown.\\"The Choice in Pakistan is Democracy or Talibanization: Guest Op-ed by Shahin M. Cole\\", Informed Comment, November 8, 2007. =Libya= Cole supported the NATO-led 2011 military intervention in Libya, which he described as \\"the UNSC-authorized intervention\\", and criticized those on the left who did not. When Cole was asked in 2015 how he felt about the results of the intervention, he said, \\"It wasn't an intervention, it was a revolution. Revolutions are messy. It turned out better than Syria, where there wasn't a significant intervention.\\" See comment and reply here. CIA harassment allegations In 2011, James Risen reported in The New York Times that Glenn Carle, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was a top counterterrorism official during the administration of President George W. Bush, \\"said the White House at least twice asked intelligence officials to gather sensitive information\\" on Cole \\"in order to discredit him\\".Risen, James (2011-06-15) Ex-Spy Alleges Bush White House Sought to Discredit Critic, The New York Times \\"In an interview, Mr. Carle said his supervisor at the National Intelligence Council told him in 2005 that White House officials wanted 'to get' Professor Cole, and made clear that he wanted Mr. Carle to collect information about him, an effort Mr. Carle rebuffed. Months later, Mr. Carle said, he confronted a CIA official after learning of another attempt to collect information about Professor Cole. Mr. Carle said he contended at the time that such actions would have been unlawful.\\"  Criticism  = Yale controversy = In 2006, Cole was nominated to teach at Yale University and was approved by both Yale's sociology and history departments. However, the senior appointments committee overruled the departments, and Cole was not appointed. According to \\"several Yale faculty members\\", the decision to overrule Cole's approval was \\"highly unusual\\".Leibovitz, Liel. \\"Middle East Wars Flare Up At Yale\\" , The Jewish Week, 2006-06-02. Retrieved on 7 June 2006. Yale Deputy Provost Charles Long stated that \\"Tenure appointments at Yale are very complicated and they go through several stages, and [the candidates] can fail to pass at any of the stages. Every year, at least one and often more fail at one of these levels, and that happened in this case.\\" The history department vote was 13 in favor, seven opposed, and three abstentions. Professors interviewed by the Yale Daily News said \\"the faculty appeared sharply divided.\\" Yale historian Paula Hyman commented that the deep divisions in the appointment committee were the primary reasons that Cole was rejected: \\"There was also concern, aside from the process, about the nature of his blog and what it would be like to have a very divisive colleague.\\" Yale political science professor Steven B. Smith commented, \\"It would be very comforting for Cole's supporters to think that this got steamrolled because of his controversial blog opinions. The blog opened people's eyes as to what was going on.\\"David White, \\"Juan Cole and Yale: The Inside Story\\", Campus Watch, August 3, 2006. Another Yale historian, John M. Merriman, said of Cole's rejection: \\"In this case, academic integrity clearly has been trumped by politics.\\"Philip Weiss, \\"Burning Cole\\", The Nation, July 3, 2006. In an interview on Democracy Now!, Cole said that he had not applied for the post at Yale: \\"Some people at Yale asked if they could look at me for a senior appointment. I said, 'Look all you want.' So that's up to them. Senior professors are like baseball players. You're being looked at by other teams all the time. If it doesn't result in an offer, then nobody takes it seriously.\\" He described the so-called \\"scandal\\" surrounding his nomination as \\"a tempest in a teapot\\" that had been exaggerated by \\"neo-con journalists\\": \\"Who knows what their hiring process is like, what things they were looking for?\\"\\"Hundreds of Thousands Rally in Iraq Against the War in Lebanon: Middle East Analyst Juan Cole on War in the Middle East - from Baghdad to Beirut\\" , Democracy Now, August 4, 2006 = Other controversies = Alexander H. Joffe in the Middle East Quarterly has written that \\"Cole suggests that many Jewish American officials hold dual loyalties, a frequent anti-Semitic theme.\\" Cole argues that his critics have \\"perverted the word 'antisemitic, and also points out that \\"in the Middle East Studies establishment in the United States, I have stood with Israeli colleagues and against any attempt to marginalize them or boycott them\\". According to Efraim Karsh, Cole has done \\"hardly any independent research on the twentieth-century Middle East\\", and characterized Cole's analysis of this era as \\"derivative\\". He has also responded to Cole's criticism of Israeli policies and the influence of the \\"Israel lobby\\", comparing them to accusations that have been made in anti-semitic writings. Cole replied directly to Karsh in his blog, dismissing one of Karsh's charges, that Cole's criticisms echo themes in the antisemitic tract Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Cole also defended his knowledge of modern Middle Eastern history, comparing his experience \\"on the ground\\" in the modern Arab world favorably with that of Bernard Lewis, a historian he said is \\"lionized\\" by Karsh.

The route colored blue is permanently closed due to earthquake and typhoon damage. 150px The Central Cross-Island Highway () or Provincial Highway 8 is one of three highway systems that connect the west coast with the east of Taiwan. Construction The construction of the Central Cross-Island Highway began on July 7, 1956 and was first opened to traffic on May 9, 1960. Route right The route of the highway begins in the west at Dongshi District in Taichung. The highway originally continued up into the Central Mountain Range following the Dajia River valley through the townships of Guguan (Ë∞∑Èóú) and Cingshan (ÈùíÂ±±). However, the section between Guguan and Lishan is permanently closed to non-residents due to earthquake and typhoon damage. At Lishan there is a branch that heads north to Yilan City. Passing through the mountains it reaches Dayuling (Â§ßÁ¶πÂ∂∫) which is the highest point of the route. Here another branch of the highway runs south from Dayuling to Puli via Wuling (Ê≠¶Â∂∫). Continuing east from Dayuling the highway route now begins its descent into the Taroko National Park. It passes through Guanyuan (ÈóúÂéü), Cih-en (ÊÖàÊÅ©), Luoshao (Ê¥õÈü∂) and before entering Taroko Gorge. After the gorge the route then connects with the eastern coastal Su'ao-Hualien Highway. Highway damage and closure The highway route runs through exceedingly rugged and unstable terrain. Heavy rain from typhoons often dislodge soil and rocks onto the highway making sections of it impassable. As well, the area is prone to seismic activity which can have disastrous effects on the highway. On September 21, 1999 the Jiji earthquake caused massive damage to the highway and cut the highway in multiple places between Guguan and Lishan. Following the unprecedented damage to the highway in 1999, there was strong debate on the feasibility and desirability of maintaining and repairing the highway. Extensive and costly repairs proceeded, and earthquake-damaged sections of the highway were due to be re-opened in 2004. However, torrential rains from Typhoon Mindulle caused further damage to the highway, forcing the affected section between Guguan and Lishan to be closed to non-residents indefinitely. While Provincial Highway 8 no longer provides a continuous route across the island, travelers from the west can use Provincial Highway 14 and Provincial Highway 14A to connect with Provincial Highway 8 in the east. On November 16, 2018, the section between Guguan and Lishan re-opened to limited traffic. 3 medium-sized busses are scheduled to run the route (back and forth) each day but no ordinary private vehicle traffic is allowed.

A burl (American English) or bur or burr (UK English) is a tree growth in which the grain has grown in a deformed manner. It is commonly found in the form of a rounded outgrowth on a tree trunk or branch that is filled with small knots from dormant buds. Description Large burl on a spruce tree at Denali State Park, Alaska A burl results from a tree undergoing some form of stress. It may be caused by an injury, virus or fungus. Most burls grow beneath the ground, attached to the roots as a type of malignancy that is generally not discovered until the tree dies or falls over. Such burls sometimes appear as groups of bulbous protrusions connected by a system of rope-like roots. Almost all burl wood is covered by bark, even if it is underground. Insect infestation and certain types of mold infestation are the most common causes of this condition. In some tree species, burls can grow to great size. The largest, at , occur in coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) and can encircle the entire trunk; when moisture is present, these burls can grow new redwood trees. The world's second-largest burls can be found in Port McNeill, British Columbia. One of the largest burls known was found around 1984 in the small town of Tamworth, New South Wales. It stands tall, with an odd shape resembling a trombone. In January 2009, this burl was controversially removed from its original location, and relocated to a public school in the central New South Wales city of Dubbo. Use A burled spruce log carved for use as a railing with built- in seats on a log cabin Burls yield a very peculiar and highly figured wood, prized for its beauty and rarity. It is sought after by furniture makers, artists, and wood sculptors. There are a number of well-known types of burls (each from a particular species); these are highly valued and sliced into veneers for furniture, inlay in doors, picture frames, household objects, automobile interior paneling and trim, musical instruments, and woodturning. The prized \\"\\" is not a species of a maple, but wood from a maple's burl (burr). The famous birdseye maple of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) superficially resembles burr maple, but it is something else entirely. Burl wood is very hard to work with hand tools or on a lathe, because its grain is twisted and interlocked, causing it to chip and shatter unpredictably. This \\"wild grain\\" makes burl wood extremely dense and resistant to splitting, which made it valued for bowls, mallets, mauls and \\"beetles\\" or \\"beadles\\" for hammering chisels and driving wooden pegs.Sloane, Eric (1973). A Museum of Early American Tools. New York: Ballantine Books. pp. 28‚Äì32. . Poaching Because of the value of burls, ancient redwoods in national Parks in Western United States have recently been poached by thieves for their burls, including at Redwood National and State Parks. Poachers often cut off the burls from the sides of the trunks using chainsaws, which exposes the tree to infection and disease, or fell the entire tree to steal burls higher up. Because of risk of poaching, Jeff Denny, the state park‚Äôs redwood coast sector supervisor, encourages those buying burl to inquire where it came from and to ensure it was obtained legally. Legal acquisition methods for burl include trees from private land cleared for new development and from lumber companies with salvage permits.

It is about 42 km northwest of Kuantan. The town began in 1900s as tin-mining community when British-based Pahang Consolidated Company Limited (PCCL) setting up the tin mining industry after mining activity begins in 1886. Sungai Lembing had roads, electricity, bungalows, schools, office building, warehouse, shops, cinema, petrol station and a hospital. Sungai Lembing were affected by 1926 floods which damaged infrastructures in the town and mining activity were suspended for three months. It was later followed by great depression and Japanese occupation of Malaya which greatly affects the tin mining industry in this town. Since independence, Sungai Lembing starts to decline as global demand for tin drops and the price of tin worldwide fell causes the mine to shut down in 1987. By this time, many out-of-work miners and other residents had moved elsewhere and causes some facilities such as shops and petrol station to closed. After 2001, Sungai Lembing was revitalized as a heritage tourism attraction with opening of Sungai Lembing Museum and subsequent investment from government has made this area one of the important tourist attraction in Pahang and had attracts large numbers of tourists. The great fire of 2019 has raised concern regarding the preservation of historical buildings, through reconstruction of old buildings is ongoing. As of 2014, there are around 5,000 residents who are still living in Sungai Lembing. Etymology There are multiple suggestions regarding the origin of the name of this place. One suggested that based on local legend, the local ruler saw a vision of a spear in the nearby river and thus named his town after this vision. Based on English translation, Lembing is Malay for spear, and \\"sungai\\" means river. Another origin story suggests that there is an incident where a group of Orang Asli threw spear over the deer, who later escaped by jumping over and disappeared in Sungai Kenau (Kenau river). Regarding the nickname given to the town as \\"El Dorado of the East\\" is because this area is rich in natural resources which will brings wealth to people. History =Foundation= Sungai Lembing in 1920s. Miners transporting tin from mining tunnel The tin mining area was the largest and deepest tin mining area in the world during that time, where the tunnel spans around with the depth between and . The mining activity begins in 1886 by Pahang Consolidated Company Limited (PCCL) which were headquartered in London and had hired approximately 1,500 miners to mine tin. During its peak, the mine was operated by 5,000 workers who produced 4,000 tons of tin annually. Sungai Lembing town later then developed in the 1900s when the British set up the tin mining industry and provided facilities and amenities to the town such as roads, electricity, bungalows, schools, office building, warehouse, shops, cinema and a hospital, although the electricity usage is limited to 12 hours per day. Imported products sold in this town are duty-free. Non-residences and visitors usually not allowed to enter the town without permission as security checkpoints were setting up in the entrance to the town, while not all types of workers can enter some building as some buildings are restricted to certain types of classes only. In 1926, Sungai Lembing suffers from flood which damages of railway track, a hospital and 250 homes and the mining operation were suspended for three months. The operation were soon affected by great depression where production quota were imposed on the tin production. It was then followed by Japanese occupation of Malaya where many mining equipment were destroyed and European personnel fled the scene. =Post independence and decline= In 1979, Pahang Consolidated Company Limited (PCCL) has transferred the ownership of the company from Britain to Malaysian, and hence renamed the company to Pahang Consolidated Public Limited Company (PCPLC). However, as worldwide demand for the tin declined in addition to the falling prices of tin worldwide, hence the mine was temporary shut down in 1986. The closure of mines has caused around 800 miners to become unemployed as the company enters receivership after financial losses. As no parties are interested in taking over the mining activity, the mine was permanently closed on 1987 by Pahang government. The closure of mining area has caused many residents to move out from town to look for better jobs elsewhere and some facilities such as shops and petrol station were forced to shut down, although some shops continued to operate as usual. Prior to 2001, the major economy sector for this area was shifted from mining to agriculture, which shifting to this sector will in fact causes flood to frequently happens than prior to mine closure period. In December 1988, two years after mine was closed, there are proposals that are made to revive the town and redevelop into tourist attraction area. One suggestion is that the former mining general's bungalow will be converted into either resthouse or museum, which latter converted into known as Sungai Lembing Museum in 2001. Secondly, around 30 former worker's quarters will be converted into chalets in order to mitigate lack of accommodations for visitors. In addition, the existing infrastructure in Sungai Lembing will be improved and a new clinic will be open to residents. The population during that time was 14,000. =Revitalization= Sungai Lembing arch. The Sungai Lembing museum was opened in 2001 which brings tourism to this town that will also bring revivals and renaissance to this town, hence the town now focused on tourism sector. The museum is a conversion of a former bungalow which were previously inhabited by British mining manager and his family, and the museum exhibits the mining history in Sungai Lembing. The museum is currently managed by Department of Museum Malaysia. On 27 March 2004, as part of Eighth Malaysian Plan, the government has allocated RM 7 million in improving the town to turn it into major tourist attraction in Pahang. This includes improvement to Sungai Lembing Museum which were visited by 193,000 visitors as of 2004, revival of mining tunnel for tourism purpose, restoration of movie theatre, and upgrading the road that connects town to tin mining area. In addition, on 16 April 2005, another RM 6.3 million was spent on restoring buildings with historic values such as clubhouses, administration buildings, factories and mining tunnels. Further developments on Sungai Lembing includes an old food court building which was demolished on 17 November 2006 to make way for reconstruction of a new food court which were completed and opened on 27 September 2008. In addition, an arch at the entrance to Sungai Lembing was constructed on 6 February 2009. Furthermore, additional 3 bridges were constructed in 2012 which would allow villager's access from Kampong Kawah, Kampung Kuala Kenau and Kampung Seberang to Sungai Lembing and the rest of nation. On 31 August 2019, a great fire burnt several century-old buildings such as 20 shophouses, 11 terrace houses and a library. The fire displaced 53 residents, whom mostly senior citizens. The great fire has prompt Malaysian Institute of Architects (PAM) to strongly advised to upgrade safety measures on historic building in order to be able to preserve the valuable historic buildings from destruction by fire. Four months after the fire, reconstruction of the building at former fire site will take place with budget of RM 10 billion, with advisory from Kyoto University. The budget will also be used to upgrade the existing facilities in Sungai Lembing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, right after the transition of level of movement control order from partially restrictive conditional MCO to less restrictive relaxed MCO where border crossing is allowed, the tourism in Sungai Lembing starts to booming again, with 80% of stalls in food court are reportedly reopened and some hostels in this area are fully booked. Most of the visitors during that time were arrived by cars instead of buses which typically seen during normal days. Despite this, social distancing and other curfews continued to practice, and mining tunnel and museum will continued to be closed until 16 June 2020. Geography =Climate= Sungai Lembing's climate is classified as tropical. The rainfall is quite significant in this area throughout the year. This climate is Af according to the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification. The temperature here averages 28 ¬∞C. In a year, the average rainfall is 120.6 mm. Precipitation is the lowest in February, with an average of 40.7 mm. With an average of 347.4 mm, the most precipitation falls in December. At an average temperature of 29 ¬∞C, May is the hottest month of the year. January and December have the lowest average temperature of the year. It is 26 ¬∞C. Between the driest and wettest months, the difference in precipitation is 306.7 mm. =Environmental issues= Since the 1990s, there is a report of slight increase of frequency of floods in this area due to changes in land-uses in river basin area especially agriculture which causes water and soil disequilibrium, which could results in imbalances among water cycle and further exacerbated by weaknesses in urban drainage system that will bring floods in this area. The flood also causes the only road that connects between Sungai Lembing and the rest of Malaysia to being cut off on 2012 and on 2014. The materials from abandoned mines were found to be potentially polluting the rivers and groundwater with harmful materials such as arsenic, iron, copper, lead, manganese, nickel and zinc. These can affect the water quality level in the stream raising concern among environmentalists. Since 2014, much of the rainforest surrounding the popular Rainbow Waterfall has been cleared to make way for a palm oil plantation. The deforestation also caused the water inside the river nearby to become polluted and affecting the villagers life who relied on river for fresh waters. This issue causes Pahang Department of Environment to issue multiple fines to Mentiga Corporation who are involved in deforestation that causes water pollution in 2018. Tourism Sungai Lembing has been designated as tourism area in Pahang since 2004 with massive investment from government. As of July 2017, locals estimated that around 2,000 to 3,000 tourists visited Sungai Lembing on every weekend, and the number will peak when there will be school holiday in both Malaysia and Singapore. Among the notable tourist attraction in this area are Sungai Lembing Museum and mining tunnel which were known for the tin mining history; crystal museum dedicated to crystals; natural attraction including hot spring, Panorama Hill and Rainbow Waterfall; place of worship including Gua Charas where the Buddhist and Hindu temple were located inside the cave.

A (right) comodule over C is a K-vector space M together with a linear map :rhocolon M to M otimes C such that # (mathrm{id} otimes Delta) circ rho = (rho otimes mathrm{id}) circ rho # (mathrm{id} otimes varepsilon) circ rho = mathrm{id}, where Œî is the comultiplication for C, and Œµ is the counit. Note that in the second rule we have identified M otimes K with M,. Examples * A coalgebra is a comodule over itself. * If M is a finite-dimensional module over a finite- dimensional K-algebra A, then the set of linear functions from A to K forms a coalgebra, and the set of linear functions from M to K forms a comodule over that coalgebra. * A graded vector space V can be made into a comodule. Let I be the index set for the graded vector space, and let C_I be the vector space with basis e_i for i in I. We turn C_I into a coalgebra and V into a C_I- comodule, as follows: :# Let the comultiplication on C_I be given by Delta(e_i) = e_i otimes e_i. :# Let the counit on C_I be given by varepsilon(e_i) = 1 . :# Let the map rho on V be given by rho(v) = sum v_i otimes e_i, where v_i is the i-th homogeneous piece of v. Rational comodule If M is a (right) comodule over the coalgebra C, then M is a (left) module over the dual algebra C‚àó, but the converse is not true in general: a module over C‚àó is not necessarily a comodule over C. A rational comodule is a module over C‚àó which becomes a comodule over C in the natural way.

It is the only part of Lincolnshire west of the River Trent. It is located between the towns of Scunthorpe, Gainsborough ‚Äì both of which are in the traditional West Riding of Lindsey ‚Äì and Doncaster (in South Yorkshire). Description The name Isle is given to the area since, prior to the area being drained by the Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden, each town or village was built on areas of dry, raised ground in the surrounding marshland. The River Don used to flow to the north and west (it has since been diverted), dividing the Isle from Yorkshire; the River Idle separates the Isle from Nottinghamshire; and the River Trent separates the Isle from the rest of Lincolnshire. Three small towns developed here: Epworth ‚Äì birthplace of John Wesley and his brother Charles; Crowle; and Haxey. The boundaries of the Isle of Axholme usually match with those of the ancient wapentake of Epworth Domesday Online - Epworth wapentake and its 17 communities: Belton, Crowle, Epworth, Haxey, Beltoft, (High and Low) Burnham, Owston Ferry, (East) Lound and (Graise)lound, Garthorpe, Luddington, Amcotts, (West) Butterwick, Althorpe, The Marshes, Waterton, Upperthorpe, and Westwoodside. Other settlements on the Isle include Eastoft, Sandtoft ‚Äì home to Europe's largest trolleybus museum ‚Äì and Wroot. Much of the northern part of the Isle has flat topography, with rich farmland used mainly to grow wheat and sugar beets. The land is particularly fertile due to its history of annual flooding from the Trent and peat soil which was created by dense ancient woodland which covered much of the Isle. Even today, in many parts of the northern Isle, petrified wood can be found at about six feet below ground; relics from this woodland, these are locally called \\"bog oaks\\". A long- distance walking route, the \\"Peatlands Way\\", traverses the Isle. Etymology Axholme means \\"island by Haxey\\", from the town name + Old Norse holmr \\"island\\". The name was recorded as Hakirhomle in 1196. The Old English suffix \\"ey\\" in \\"Haxey\\" also indicates an island. Historical descriptions =1833 description= =1911 description= Land drainage history The Isle is known for the early influence of Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch engineer who initiated the realignment of several of the highland carriers flowing through the district. To carry out the work he brought in a large number of Flemish workers, many of whom settled permanently despite violent opposition from the established population. The drainage allowed increased agricultural production, and has left a legacy in the unique strip farming which survives in the 21st century around Epworth. The watercourses of the Isle and the surrounding area are managed by the Isle of Axholme Internal Drainage Board which maintains 302 km of watercourse and 18 pumping stations,Isle of Axholme Internal Drainage Board website and manages the water levels of the adjacent Thorne Moors and Hatfield Moors, both environmentally sensitive areas. Road and railway The Axholme Joint Railway traversed the area, but the line has now been abandoned. There are still railway stations in and on the line between Scunthorpe and Sheffield. The M180 motorway now crosses the centre of the area, dividing 'South Axholme', centred on Epworth, from 'North Axholme', centred on Crowle. The A161 road crosses the Isle from north to south. There was an Isle of Axholme Rural District from 1894 to 1974, which covered the entire Isle after 1936. This became part of the Boothferry district of Humberside in 1974, and since 1996 has been in the North Lincolnshire unitary authority.

As a Progressive Era reformer, Beard was active in both the labor and women's rights movements. She also authored several books on women's role in history including On Understanding Women (1931), America Through Women's Eyes (editor, 1933), and Woman as Force in History: A Study in Traditions and Realities (1946), her major work. In addition, she collaborated with her husband, historian Charles Austin Beard, as coauthor of seven textbooks, most notably The Rise of American Civilization (1927), two volumes, and America in Midpassage: A Study of the Idea of Civilization (1939) and The American Spirit (1942), the third and fourth volume of The Rise of American Civilization series. A standalone book, Basic History of the United States, was their best-selling work. During the early decades of the twentieth century, Beard actively supported passage of the Nineteenth Amendment and was involved with several women's suffrage organizations that included the Women's Trade Union League, the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women (later renamed the Women's Political Union), the New York City Suffrage Party, and the Wage-Earners' Suffrage League. She was also a member of the advisory board of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (later called the National Woman's Party. For a time, she edited suffrage publications, The Woman Voter and The Suffragist. Beard's interest in women's history led to her work in establishing the World Center for Women's Archives in 1935 in New York City. Although the center closed in 1940, largely due to internal issues and lack of funding, her efforts encouraged several colleges and universities to begin collecting similar records on women's history. Beard was a consultant on the early development of women's history archives at Radcliffe and Smith Colleges, which eventually led to establishment of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, and the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College. Early life =Family background= Mary Ritter was born on August 5, 1876, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Narcissa (Lockwood) and Eli Foster Ritter. She was the family's fourth child and the eldest daughter.Sources disagree on whether there were six or seven children in the Ritter family. See: Also: Lane identified two older brothers, Halstead and Roscoe; Ruth, the youngest of the Ritter children; and two other brothers, Dwight and Herman, no order of birth given, but made no mention of another sibling. Herman Ritter died while a senior at DePauw University. See also: \\"Biographical\\" note in The \\"Biographical\\" note indicates that Mary Ritter was the third of six children, which neglects to count her younger brother Raymond, who died on January 28, 1887, at the age of five (see WPA Death Index for Indiana, Vol. H2, p. 209; and Raymond's burial record in the family plot via Findagrave.com). Both the 1900 and 1910 U.S. Federal Census enumerations also state that seven children had been born to Narcissa. Mary's mother, Narcissa (Lockwood) Ritter was born in Paris, Kentucky, and graduated from Brookville Academy in Thornton, Kentucky. She worked as a teacher in Kentucky before moving with her family in 1861 to Greencastle, Indiana (home to Asbury, now DePauw University).Lane, ed., Mary Ritter Beard (1988), pp. 13‚Äì14. Eli Ritter, Mary's father, was the son of Rachel (Jessup) and James Ritter. He was born and grew up on his parents' farm west of Indianapolis in Hendricks County, Indiana. After attending Northwestern Christian University (present-day Butler University) in Indianapolis from 1859‚Äì61, he enlisted in the Union Army in April 1861, joining the 16th Indiana Infantry Regiment shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War. Eli Ritter was later transferred to the 79th Indiana Infantry Regiment before being honorably discharged from the army in June 1863. Following his military service, he enrolled at Asbury University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1865. He married Narcissa Lockwood, a Greencastle resident, in June 1866. Due to weak eyesight, resulting from exposure during the war, Eli Ritter relied on his wife, Narcissa, to read to him during his legal studies. After he passed the Indiana bar in 1866, the Ritters moved to Indianapolis, where Eli established a law practice. In addition, he was active in the temperance movement and in 1883 became a colonel in the Indiana National Guard. =Education and intellectual development= Mary Ritter attended public schools in Indianapolis and graduated from Shortridge High School in 1893 as valedictorian of her class. Around the age of sixteen, she enrolled in 1893 at DePauw University, the alma mater of her father and her other siblings, and became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.Weber, pp. 8‚Äì9.Sarah Bair, \\"Mary Ritter Beard,\\" in Lane, ed., Mary Ritter Beard (1988), p. 16. She also served as president of her class. Ritter graduated from DePauw in 1897 with a bachelor of philosophy (PhB) degree. (Subscription required) Ritter later claimed to be influenced by two sorority sisters at DePauw who refused to limit themselves to conventional coursework and activities for women. Another early influence on Ritter was her German professor, Henry B. Longden, who incorporated culture, literature, and philosophy into his teaching of the German language, asking his students to view their studies in a much broader context. While attending college, Ritter met and began a relationship with Charles Austin Beard, a fellow student and her future husband. Beard, a native of Henry County, Indiana, was the son of a wealthy farmer and real-estate investor. After attending Spiceland Academy (a Quaker school in Henry County), Beard enrolled at DePauw University in 1894, and became a Phi Beta Kappa graduate in 1898. =Marriage and family life= After graduating from DePauw in 1897, Ritter found employment in Greencastle as a public high school German language teacher, while Beard, then her fianc√©, traveled to England in August 1898 to pursue graduate studies at the University of Oxford. He also helped to establish Ruskin Hall (present-day Ruskin College), a free university for working-class men, before returning to the United States in late 1899. The couple married in March 1900. A month later, they moved to England, where they initially lived at Oxford, then relocated to Manchester while Charles continued his studies and worked as director of Ruskin Hall's extension department. Their daughter, Miriam, the first of their two children, was born at Manchester in 1901. In 1902, after deciding to return to the United States, the Beards settled in New York City, where they both enrolled as graduate students in the School of Political Science at Columbia University. By 1904, Mary Ritter Beard had discontinued her studies in sociology and became more active in the women's suffrage movement. The Beards' son, William, was born in 1907, the same year they bought a sixteen-room home in New Milford, Connecticut, where they frequently entertained guests.Weber, pp. 9‚Äì10. Charles Beard completed his doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree in history, and became a faculty member at Columbia University. He resigned his professorship in 1917 as a protest, following the dismissal of three anti-war faculty members during World War I, but continued his career as a writer and historian. European influences While living in England from 1900 to 1902, Mary Beard studied history and taught German.Cott, A Woman Making History, pp. 6‚Äì7. She also observed the plight of the working class in British industrial society. Beard became involved in the British labor and women's suffrage movements through her friendships with radical suffragists and socialist reformers Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel Pankhurst and Sylvia Pankhurst, who were members of the Independent Labour Party, and other leaders. Beard's acquaintances with European intellectuals also influenced her interests in the struggles of the working class, progressive politics, social reform, and social injustice. Suffrage movement Mary Ritter Beard - undated photograph Beard became involved with radical supporters of the women's in the suffrage movement in England through her friendship with Emmeline Pankhurst, a neighbor in Manchester, and Pankhurst's daughters. Beard also began to support issues affecting working- class women. After the Beards returned to the United States in 1902, Mary continued her activism in labor organizations such as the New York Women's Trade Union League (WTUL), where she hoped to improve the conditions under which women labored. In addition to WTUL, Beard was active in the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women (later the Women's Political Union).Cott, A Woman Making History, p. 11. Beard came to believe that suffrage would give women a tool to elect political leaders who would, in turn, implement social justice reforms and governmental regulations to improve economic conditions and the lives of the working class. By 1910 she was active in women's suffrage activities in New York as a member of the New York City Suffrage Party (NYCSP), led by Carrie Chapman Catt. From 1910 to 1912, Beard also edited its publication The Woman Voter, before focusing more of her efforts on the Wage- Earners' Suffrage League.Cott, A Woman Making History, p. 13. Beard left the NYCSP in 1913 to join the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU) (later called the National Woman's Party) under the leadership of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns. As a member of this radical faction of the women's suffrage movement, , Beard helped to organize women's suffrage rallies and served as editor of its weekly magazine. The Suffragist. At Paul's request, Beard became a member of the Union's congressional committee. She was among the organizers of a major woman's suffrage parade in Washington, D.C., on March 3, 1913, and served as a marshal for a section of the parade that included many African American women, whom Beard insisted should participate.Cott, A Woman Making History, pp. 69‚Äì70. Beard's contributions to the Congressional Union also included strategy planning, organizingd and participatind in demonstrations, delivering lectures, writing articles, and testifying before Congress, including an appearance before a U.S. House of Representatives congressional committee on women's suffrage in 1914. Shortly before her resignation from the National Woman's Party's Advisory Council, Beard lead a New York delegation to Washington, D.C., in November 1917 to show support for the women's suffrage activists (Silent Sentinels) who had picketed in front of the White House.Cott, A Woman Making History, p. 14. Writings =Collaborations with Charles Beard= From their home in Connecticut, Mary and Charles Beard co- authored seven books together, beginning with American Citizenship (1914), a high school textbook. Although they are named as coauthors, their contemporaries, including book reviewers and fellow historians, overlooked Mary's contributions.Bair, \\"Citizenship for the Common Good,\\" p. 9.Weber, pp. 10‚Äì11. Historians Barbara Turoff, Ann Lane, and Nancy Cott, in their assessment of Mary Beard's works, and Ellen Nore, in her research on Charles Beard, have concluded that the Beards' collaboration was a full partnership, as the couple confirmed, but the Beards did not fully describe their individual contributions to their published works.Crocco, pp. 20‚Äì21. The Beards' other joint works include History of the United States (1921), later retitled A Study in American Civilization, and their two-volume work, The Rise of American Civilization (1927), their most notable collaboration.Crocco, pp. 12‚Äì13. They also cowrote a third and fourth volume of The Rise of American Civilization series: America in Midpassage: A Study of the Idea of Civilization (1939) and The American Spirit (1942). Standalone works include The Making of American Civilization (1937) and Basic History of the United States (1944). The Beards' textbooks sold five million copies between 1912 and 1952. Basic History of the United States was their best-selling work.Cott, A Woman Making History, p. 51.Crocco, pp. 9‚Äì10. The Beards' content in History of the United States differed from other textbooks through its thematic organization, as opposed to narrative history; their emphasis on \\"the causes and results of wars,\\" rather than on specific military details; and inclusion of materials at the end of each chapter to develop critical thinking skills. The Beards also provided reference sources, discussion questions, research topic ideas, and suggested related works of historical fiction. In addition, their textbooks included more recent history (from 1890 to 1920), as well as the Beards' interpretation of America's role in world affairs. History of the United States and their subsequent books also included Mary Beard's expanded views on women's contributions to civilization; profiles of notable women; and topics such as women's labor, education, political status and influence, legal status, and women's rights, among others.Crocco, p. 14. History of the United States presents the Beards' Progressive-Era views and links democracy to economic and social conditions. The book \\"attracted a very broad readership\\" and, as Ann J. Lane later stated, it \\"shaped the thinking of generations of Americans.\\"Crocco, p. 15. The Rise of American Civilization (1927) integrated cultural, social, economic, and political history, as well as recognizing women's impact on these aspects of civilization. The book also described the importance of including women‚Äôs perspectives in history as a whole. In America in Midpassage (1939), a political and economic examination of the 1920s and 1930s, the Beards criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt's foreign policy prior to World War II. The book also includes cultural and intellectual contributions of numerous individuals such as Eugene Debs, Jane Addams, Harriet Stanton Blatch, Florence Kelley, and others.Crocco, pp. 16 and 18. The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (1942), \\"makes explicit the reason for their preference for the concept of civilization in dealing with the history of the United States\\" and its connection to democracy, citizenship, and public affairs.Crocco, p. 19. =Individual and edited works= Mary Beard's Woman's Work in Municipalities (1915), the first of six books that she wrote as a solo author, argued that women's social reform efforts could be considered political activities as well. She also urged women to pursue leadership positions in municipal government.Weber, p. 10.Crocco, p. 11. Beard‚Äôs book, A Short History of the American Labor Movement (1920), concerns social reform and the working class, but she is best known for her authored and edited works on women's history, especially On Understanding Women (1931), America Through Women's Eyes (editor, 1933), and her major work, Woman as Force in History: A Study in Traditions and Realities (1946) her most influential publication.Weber, p. 12. To increase interest in research on women's history, Beard used multiple channels of communication, including pamphlets, radio shows, articles, speeches, and books. Beard's Woman as Force in History (1946) challenges the traditional feminists' view and argues that women had always been active agents in history alongside men. She further contends that focusing on women as victims instead of their impact in the world was distorted and inaccurate. Beard also believed that a woman's social class and her gender play important roles in her achievements.Crocco, p. 25. Beard rejected the feminist idea that women had been subjugated by men and \\"deliberately played down the very real constrictions on women through the centuries.\\"Weber, p. 11. She believed strongly in encouraging women through her writing about the importance of women's history, declaring: \\"We cannot know how our own society has been built up without known women's share in establishing free speech, free assembly, freedom of worship, all civil liberties, all humanism, all the branches of learning and everything else we value.\\"Weber (2003), p. 11. Beard also wrote a 56-page pamphlet, \\"A Changing Political Economy as it Affects American Women\\" (1934), sponsored by the American Association of University Women, that was a prototype for a course on women's studies. Despite her efforts, she was unable to gain its adoption for college- or university-level courses. Beard also wrote and edited other books on women's history: Laughing Their Way: Women's Humor in America (coedited with Martha Bruiere, 1934), and The Force of Women in Japanese History (1953). Her final book was a tribute to her husband, The Making of Charles Beard (1955). =Women's history scholar= With the successful passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, Beard began to concentrate more on her writing and to further develop her philosophy concerning women in history, which frequently set her at odds with the feminist movement.Turoff, p. 51 Mary and Charles Beard were active supporters of the \\"New History\\" movement, which sought to include social, cultural, and economic factors in written history‚Äîan important step towards including the contributions of women. Mary Beard expanded on this concept, contending that the proper study of women's \\"long history\\", from primitive pre-history to the present, would reveal that women have always played a central role in all civilizations. She also emphasized that women were different from men, but that did not make their contributions of any less value, only that their significance was simply not being recognized. In the 1930s, Beard disagreed with feminists of the era, whom she believed viewed their history as one of oppression. She also created a controversy over her rejection of the feminist goal of equality with men, feminists sought to achieve through passage of an Equal Rights Amendment, which Beard opposed, among other activities.Crocco, p. 23. To Beard, the traditional feminist view ow women's oppression was not only inaccurate but unhelpful, and that striving for equality with men was an inadequate goal, especially in relation to education.Bair, \\"Citizenship for the Common Good,\\" p. 5. Beard felt the women can and should offer something different and more socially beneficial to society, and that women should be providers of \\"culture and civilization\\". =Archivist= In 1935, international peace activist and feminist Rosika Schwimmer suggested the idea to Beard of establishing the World Center for Women's Archives (WCWA), which held its first organizational meeting in New York City in October 1935.Voss-Hubbard, pp. 19‚Äì20. As director of the center for the next five years, Beard broadened the scope of the project beyond collecting the documents related to women in the peace movement. She hoped to collect in a central repository any and all manner of women's published and unpublished records and other archival materials related to women's history at an international level. She also planned to establish an institution for women's research, education, and political initiatives, as well as supporting efforts to aid in the writing of history. Beard chose the center's motto, \\"No documents, no history,\\" from a quote by French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges.Cott, A Woman Making History, pp. 47, 216‚Äì20. Through Beard's contacts, the center accumulated project sponsors. In addition, Carrie Chapman Catt, Jane Addams, Harriet Stanton Blatch, and other prominent women such as Alice Paul, Georgia O'Keeffe, Fannie Hurst, and Inez Haynes Irwin also offered their support. Schwimmer resigned from the center's board of directors in 1936, but Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins endorsed the WCWA, which was officially launched in New York City on December 15, 1937. The center initially gained publicity and support for its efforts to collect materials, preserve records, and generate interest in women's history. However, as director of the center, Beard dealt with a multitude of competing interests, a result of long-standing differences within the women's movement, as well as insufficient funding and disagreements among its leadership. The Center never lived up to Beard's expectations and she resigned in 1940. The WCWA closed later that year, largely because of internal strife and a lack of funding, without fully achieving its goals.Voss-Hubbard, pp. 20‚Äì23.Cott, A Woman Making History, pp. 216-20. Beard's work with the WCWA encouraged several colleges and universities to begin collecting similar records on women's history. She is credited with helping to develop a women's history archives at Radcliffe and Smith colleges, which eventually led to establishing the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University and the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith.Voss-Hubbard, pp. 22‚Äì23. In addition, some of the WCWA's records were transferred to smaller collections such as the New Jersey Historical Society. Beard's efforts at the WCWA also inspired the later work of the Women's Project of New Jersey, Inc. =Critique of Britannica= After the dissolution of the World Centre for Women's Archives in 1940, Beard's next project, beginning in 1941, was an analysis of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's representation of women, produced following the suggestion of Walter Yust, chief editor of the Britannica. Beard convened a team of fellow female scholars (Dora Edinger, Janet A. Selig, and Marjorie White) to produce A Study of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in Relation to its Treatment of Women. Beard and her colleagues collaborated on the project over an 18-month period, and in November 1942 delivered the 42-page report to Yust. Despite Yust's expressed interest and assurances that the Britannica would include improvements, the report's recommendations were ignored. Beard was disappointed with the result, and in 1947 correspondence she suggested that women should no longer write for the publication. The report included significant recommendations on existing articles, as well as suggestions for new articles. For example, the authors noted that the treatment of abortion was not comprehensive. Arguing that it was more than a moral question, the researchers proposed that abortion was also relevant to population, political, health, medical, and social issues. The study also noted that the article on education was too masculine; questioned why there was no article on \\"Queen;\\" and why women were not included in the Britannica's treatment of health and medicine. Additionally, from the article on \\"Song\\" the report noted: \\"No women sang in Europe, it appears from this review. The contributions of nuns, in choir composition and singing, is not recognized at all.\\" Topics that the authors recommended for inclusion included bathing, breadmaking, dyeing, hospital, hunger, laundrying, and salons, among others. Later years Mary Beard became an active member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Mary and Charles Beard, both of whom were pacifists, also opposed the United States' involvement in World War II. After Charles's death in 1948, at North Haven, Connecticut, Mary continued to write and remain active into her late seventies. Her final books were The Force of Women in Japanese History (1953), published two decades after she and her husband had visited Japan in 1922‚Äì23, and The Making of Charles Beard (1955), a tribute to her late husband.Weber, p. 13.Bair, ‚ÄúCitizenship for the Common Good,‚Äù p. 10. After becoming ill around the age of eighty, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, to live near her son, William. Death and legacy Mary Beard died of kidney failure on August 14, 1958, at the age of eighty-two, at Phoenix in Maricopa County, Arizona. Her remains are interred in Ferncliff Cemetery at Hartsdale in Westchester County, New York, beside those of her husband, Charles, died on September 1, 1948. Despite Beard's efforts to acquire the personal papers of women throughout the world and from all time periods in history for the World Center for Women's Archives, she did not consider her own manuscripts, letters, and her other documents of value. Before their deaths, she and her husband, whose pacifist stance proved controversial in the last decade of his life, destroyed nearly all of their personal correspondence and papers that they considered confidential. Mary Beard did not plan to publish any of their letters and did not want others to do so; however, some of the surviving letters found in the collections of other individuals were later published.Cott, A Woman Making History, pp. ix‚Äìx. Mary and Charles Beards' legacy stems from their published works. The couple's co-authorship of broad and inclusive textbooks was innovative for their time. In addition to incorporating social, economic, and political history, they included contemporary issues and women's contributions to civilization.Bair, Citizenship for the Common Good, pp. 13‚Äì14. Margaret Crocco points out that the interdisciplinary approach the Beards used in their textbooks encouraged the development of academic programs in American society in the 1930s and 1940s at colleges and universities including Yale University, Brown University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Pennsylvania.Crocco, p. 27. Mary was retroactively elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa in 1939. (In 1897, when she graduated from DePauw University, only males were awarded this academic honor.) In History and Feminism: A Glass Half Full (1993), Judith Zinsser argues that beginning in the 1930s, Mary Beard \\"was the most well-known authority and advocate for women's history in the Unites States.\\"Crocco, p. 21. Beard's writings and the actions she took during her life on behalf of women's suffrage, labor issues, and establishment of women's archives also helped to illuminate the contributions that women made throughout history. By end of twentieth century, other historians began to consciously integrate women's contributions to history in their publications such as Howard Zinn's revision of A People's History of the United States (rev. 1995).Weber, p. 13. Margaret Crocco concluded that Mary Beard's perspectives on women's history, in general, and Beard's contention that women have also been active agents in history \\"remain at the forefront of the field today.\\"Crocco, p. 28. In The Majority Finds Its Past: Placing Women in History (1979), historian Gerda Lerner described the ongoing efforts to write about women's history as continuing the work that Beard had begun. Although Beard's work to establish a women's archive in New York City was unsuccessful, she consulted on other women's archive initiatives that eventually lead to the establishment of the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, as well as the Sophia Smith Collection at the Neilson Library at Smith College, and other women's history projects such as those in New Jersey. One of Mary Beard's indirect legacies was the development of women's history courses, which have become standard offerings on American college campuses.

It is a company which is restricted to mining activities and is the only sort of corporation which is entitled to this form of liability, given the sometimes financially risky business of mining. Most of the usual rules in the Act apply to no-liability companies, save that a mining company must adopt a constitution which states their objects as mining. No-liability companies should not be confused with the concept of limited liability. No- liability companies are differentiated from other companies as their shareholders are not liable to pay calls on unpaid shares. This differs from traditional company structure where the purchase of shares is a binding contract. Should the shareholder choose not to pay when there is a call, the shareholder forfeits both the unpaid and paid shares.http://www.anz.com/edna/dictionary.asp?action=content&content;=no_liability This encourages investment in potentially risky mining ventures, as a shareholder with unpaid shares can choose to withdraw from the company with no legal consequences. A successful mining company usually converts to a limited liability company when advantageous.  Forfeiture  Shares upon which calls had not been paid were forfeit and offered for sale by auction after 14 days. Former owners could redeem their forfeited shares by paying the call and perhaps a fee to cover expenses.  Company names  Early on in the life of the No Liability system, such companies were identified as * ABC Mining (registered) Then the \\"No Liability\\" tag took over, such as * ABC Mining (no liability) * DEF Mining no liability And finally * GHI Mining N.L. The word \\"mining\\" does not have to appear in the name of the company.

This was particularly useful when NL status was first introduced. No Liability companies which discovered a payable deposit of ore would normally convert to Limited status as this facilitated the financing of that mine.

The region encompasses the city of Shanghai, the southern part of Jiangsu Province, the southeastern part of Anhui Province, the northern part of Jiangxi Province and the northern part of Zhejiang Province. The most important cities in the area include Anqing, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Wenzhou, and Zhenjiang. Jiangnan has long been regarded as one of the most prosperous regions in China due to its wealth in natural resources and very high human development. Most people of the region speak Wu Chinese dialects as their native languages. Etymology The word Jiangnan is based on the Chinese name for the Yangtze, Ch√°ng JiƒÅng, and n√°n meaning \\"south.\\"Ê±üÂçó jiƒÅngn√°n In the 19th century, English speakers also called it Keang-nan.  History  Village in Jiangnan The earliest archaeological evidences were of the Majiabang and of the Hemudu cultures. The later Liangzhu culture, from around 2600‚Äì2000 BC, created complex and beautiful jade artifacts. Their economy was based on rice cultivation, fishing and constructed houses on stilts over rivers or lakes. During the Zhou dynasty, the Wu and Baiyue peoples inhabited the area with heavy aquaculture and stilt houses, but became increasingly sinicized through contact with northern Chinese states. They adopted the Chinese writing system and created excellent bronze swords. The Chu state from the west (in Hubei) expanded into this area and defeated the Yue state. After Chu was conquered by the Qin state, China was unified. It was not until the fall of the Western Jin dynasty during the early 4th century AD that northern Chinese moved to Jiangnan in significant numbers. The Yellow River valley was becoming barren due to flooding (lack of trees after intensive logging to create farmland) and constant harassment and invasion by the Wu Hu nomads. Although Chinese civilization originated in the North China Plain around the Yellow River, natural climate change and continuous harassment from nomadic enemies damaged North China's agricultural productivity throughout the 1st millennium AD. Many people settled in South China, where the Jiangnan area's warm and wet climate were ideal for supporting agriculture and allowed highly sophisticated cities to arise. As early as the Eastern Han dynasty (circa 2nd century AD), Jiangnan areas became one of the more economically prominent areas of China. Other than rice, Jiangnan produced highly profitable trade products such as tea, silk, and celadon porcelain (from Shangyu). Convenient transportation ‚Äì the Grand Canal to the north, the Yangtze River to the west, and seaports such as Yangzhou ‚Äì contributed greatly to local trade and also trade between ancient China and other nations. Several Chinese dynasties were based in Jiangnan. After the Qin dynasty fell, the insurgent state of Chu took control. Its ruler, Xiang Yu, was born here. During the Three Kingdoms period, Jianye (present-day Nanjing) was the capital of Eastern Wu. In the 3rd century, many northern Chinese moved here after nomadic groups controlled the north. In the 10th century, Wuyue was a small coastal kingdom founded by Qian Liu who made a lasting cultural impact on Jiangnan and its people to this day. After the Jurchen completely overran northern China in the Jin‚ÄìSong war of the 1120s, the exiled Song dynasty government retreated south, establishing the new Southern Song capital at Hangzhou in 1127. stone tortoise with a tablet commemorating the Kangxi Emperor's visit to Nanjing in 1684 During the last years of the Yuan dynasty, Jiangnan was fought for by two major rebel states: Zhu Yuanzhang's Ming faction, based in Nanjing, and the Suzhou-centered Wu faction led by Zhang Shicheng. A ten-year rivalry ended with Zhu's capture of Suzhou in 1367; having thus reunified Jiangnan, Zhu proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Ming dynasty on Chinese New Year's Day (20 January) of 1368, and a few months later expelled the Mongols from Northern China as well. Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming dynasty until the early 15th century, when the third Ming ruler, the Yongle Emperor, moved the capital to Beijing. When the Qing dynasty first took over China, Jiangnan's gentry offered resistance in the form of denying the ability to deal with taxes to the government. The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty made many visits to Jiangnan (), which have been the popular subject of numerous Chinese operas and television dramas. Earlier, the Kangxi Emperor visited the region as well. During the 19th century Taiping Rebellion, the regime established by the Taiping rebels occupied much of Jiangnan and eventually made Nanjing its capital. The area suffered much damage as the rebellion was quelled and Qing imperial rule restored. After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, and Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, the Republic of China (ROC), following the wishes of Sun Yat-sen, made Nanjing the national capital. From the late 1920s until the Second World War, the Jiangnan area was the focus of Chinese economic development. Much of the Kuomintang's ruling elite and the ROC's economic elite hailed from the Jiangnan area. =Geographical identity= Shizi Lin Dialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the Jiangbei and Jiangnan regions. While the city of Yangzhou was a flourishing and prosperous center of trade, it was considered part of Jiangnan (south of the river), which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangtze River. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity began to wane, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the \\"backwater\\". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided to replace Jianghuai Mandarin, which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with Taihu Wu dialects. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.

Jean-Pierre Gorin was a student of Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan. He was a radical leftist well before meeting Godard in 1966. Godard relied on some of his discussions with Gorin while writing the script of 1967's La Chinoise. Gorin played a role in making Le Gai Savoir, which was released in 1969. In 1968, Gorin and Godard founded the collective Dziga Vertov Group and together produced a series of overtly political films including Vent d'est (1970), Tout va bien (1972), and Letter to Jane (1972). Gorin left France in the mid-1970s to accept a teaching position at the University of California, San Diego at the urging of the film-critic and painter Manny Farber. Gorin remained on the Visual Arts faculty thereafter, teaching film history and film criticism. He continued to make films--most notably a \\"Southern California tetralogy\\" of essay films: Poto and Cabengo (1978), Routine Pleasures (1986), My Crasy Life (1991), and Letter to Peter (1992).

As of 2014, the company has produced more than 3,900 organs.  Company history  Interior of the pipe shop, 1930 Brothers Joseph- Claver (1855‚Äì1933) and Samuel-Marie (1859‚Äì1929) got their start in organ building in the shop of their father, Joseph Casavant, under his successor Eus√®be Brodeur. Claver worked with Brodeur during 1874‚Äì1878, then went to France for a 14-month apprenticeship with the firm of John Abbey in Versailles. He and Samuel then visited many organs and workshops in western Europe before establishing their factory in 1879 on the site of their father's workshop on rue Girouard in Saint-Hyacinthe.  Technical innovations  Their instruments boasted many innovations unique for that time, such as concave pedalboards, balanced expression pedals, keyboard improvements, and other enhancements. Their reputation as organ builders of international status was cemented in 1891 with their construction of the organ for the Notre-Dame de Montr√©al Basilica, a four-manual organ of eighty-two stops. This organ features adjustable combinations and speaking pipes of thirty-two foot length in the fa√ßade.\\"Who needs Paris? Montreal is the new ‚ÄòCity of Light‚Äô\\". Adam Bisby, Montreal, The Globe and Mail, April 30, 2018 They won the Grand Prix at the International Exhibition held in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1930. They built organs around the world, including Canada, the United States, France, the West Indies, South and Central America, South Africa, and Japan. Their organs have been praised by many well-known organists over the last 100 years, including Guilmant, Vierne, Widor, Bonnet, Lemare, Dethier, Courboin, Bingham, and many others who inaugurated and played Casavant organs. Casavant organs are also found in colleges, universities and conservatories in the United States and Canada. After the death of the Casavant brothers, the company continued to add innovations to their instruments. These include a particularly reliable key contact and tracker touch mechanism, which is a feature of the Casavant playing action. During the 1960s, Casavant developed new electronic technology to the capture system of combination actions. In 1960, the company returned to mechanical action technology (while continuing to build electropneumatic action instruments as well) and has since built over two hundred tracker action instruments ranging in size from a single manual portable Continuo of four stops to two, three, and four manual organs. New technology, such as solid-state coupling and switching systems, multiplex, multi-memory combination actions and MIDI have been adopted. Other improvements, such as more effective expressive enclosures, continue to be made. The sound and style of Casavant organs has varied throughout the company's history. The Casavant brothers themselves, Samuel and Claver Casavant, reflected mostly influences from contemporary France, but they traveled widely and visited many European instruments. They later brought in an Englishman, Stephen Stoot, under whose direction the tonal palette reflected additional influences from England. Later tonal directors, Lawrence Phelps and Gerhard Brunzema, contributed styles from the German \\"Organ Reform Movement\\". The most recent tonal directors, Jean-Louis Coignet and Jacquelin Rochette, are rooted in but not limited to the various French organ building traditions.

In 1850, he received an order for a church organ from Bytown, Canada West. While living there temporarily, he married his second wife Marie-Olive Sicard de Carufel. By the time he retired in 1866, he had built 17 organs, including the ones for the Catholic cathedrals of Ottawa and Kingston, and the village church in Mont-Saint-Hilaire.

Buell, 2003. History He was born in Henan province. His paternal line originated in Central Asia, probably of recent Bayad Mongol descent, but identified as Han Chinese by the time of his birth. His mother was either of Naiman or Uyghur origin, and the sister of Chaghan Tem√ºr. K√∂ke Tem√ºr was adopted by his maternal uncle Chaghan Tem√ºr, a Turkic pro-Mongol warlord who fought against the Red Turban Rebellion. When his uncle died in war in Shandong in 1362, he succeeded Chaghan Tem√ºr's post and corps, and soon demonstrated military talent in battles with the Red Turban Rebels in Shandong. Rebels and warlords at the end of Yuan Dynasty, including territories under K√∂ke Tem√ºr's control in 1363. He intensified a feud with Bolad Tem√ºr a Datong-based warlord, and entered Taiyuan to confront him. He took the side of Crown Prince Ayushiridara against the faction of Toghun Temur Khan in a factional dispute in Dadu since Bolad Tem√ºr supported the anti-crown prince faction. In 1364, Bolad Tem√ºr advanced from Datong on Dadu and seized the reins of the central government under the khan. Crown Prince Ayushiridara fled to Taiyuan to seek support from K√∂ke Tem√ºr. The Crown Prince struck back with K√∂ke Tem√ºr, and Bolad Tem√ºr was betrayed when K√∂ke Tem√ºr attacked Dadu in 1365. He reinstated the Crown Prince, and was appointed as vice minister of the Secretariat and the king of Henan in return. However, this conflict helped Zhu Yuanzhang's rise to power in southern China. K√∂ke Tem√ºr commanded the Yuan army against anti-Yuan rebels, but faced betrayal by subordinates including Chinese officers who had followed him since the very early stage. What was worse was that he got alienated from Ayushiridara, who was given political and military controls by Toghun Tem√ºr Khan. After two major defeats (he fled alone in both occasions), he lost Henan and Taiyuan to the rising Ming corps and fled to Gansu. The Yuan dynasty was forced to retreat from China in 1368. In 1370 when Toghun Temur died and Ayushiridara succeeded to the throne,The Cambridge history of China, by Denis Twitchett et al., pp 99-100, Cambridge University Press, Koke Temur entered the Mongolian Plateau from Gansu and joined the new khan, who was based in Khara Khorum.

But Koke Temur did not abandon his khagan in his misfortune.Mingshi The most notable service was an overwhelming desert victory over a Ming army led by Xu Da in 1372. It is said that he killed 20,000 Ming soldiers. But in a further encounter against Xu Da in Gansu, K√∂ke Tem√ºr's army was badly mauled by the Chinese and forced to flee across the Gobi desert. K√∂ke Tem√ºr's sister was married to prince Zhu Shuang, the second son of the Ming Hongwu Emperor.

Early life A native of Oneonta, New York, Bellinger played shortstop for Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. Career Bellinger was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the second round (44th overall pick) in the 1989 draft. His first 10 seasons of professional baseball were spent in the minor leagues, six in Triple-A. Before his first call-up as a 30-year-old in 1999, he played more than 1,000 minor league games. Bellinger played for the New York Yankees in , , and . He played every position (including designated hitter) except for catcher and pitcher. In the ninth inning of Game 2 of the 2000 World Series, Bellinger was inserted in left field in place of David Justice. Bellinger's glove went over the wall to rob the Mets' Todd Zeile of a two-run home run and preserve a victory for the Yankees. The Yankees released him when he became eligible for arbitration; Bellinger then signed with the Anaheim Angels. He played two games at first base for the Angels in , had one at-bat in which he struck out, and was eventually demoted to the minor leagues. International career While playing in the Baltimore Orioles system in 2004, he was recruited by owner Peter Angelos to play for the Greek baseball team in the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. Bellinger has Greek grandparents, and Angelos was in charge of the Greek national baseball team. In order to field a competitive team in the Olympics, Angelos made the decision to use experienced American players with mostly distant Greek ancestry (players' ancestry eligibility was allowed to date as far back as great-grandparents), as opposed to native Greeks due to their inexperience in a country where baseball was almost never played. Bellinger agreed as he hoped it would earn him a September call-up to the Orioles' roster when the Olympics were over. The Greek team went 1‚Äì6 and failed to advance to the medal round. Bellinger was one of a handful of players on the roster with Major League experience, and the only player to have won a World Series ring. He was not promoted to the Orioles' roster after the games concluded.

During World War II Sea Cat operated within the Pacific theatre, conducting four war patrols in wolf packs accounting for up to 17400 tons in the form of three cargo ships and an enemy vessel (17000 tons unconfirmed by wartime Japanese records). Sea Cat earned three battle stars for her World War II service. After two and one-half years of exercises out of Balboa, her home port was changed to Key West in June 1949. In the autumn, it was decided to have a number of experimental changes made to the ship during her forthcoming overhaul, and she was redesignated AGSS-399 on 30 September. On 7 November, she arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where the work was done. The modifications and repairs were completed on 11 March 1950, and the submarine returned, via New London, to Key West. She operated from that base until she got under way on 9 January 1952 for Philadelphia and another overhaul. After her arrival on 15 January, she was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine and redesignated SS-399. She operated in Floridas waters and the Caribbean until she was decommissioned on 2 December 1968 and struck from the Navy list on the same day. She was sold for scrapping, 18 May 1973. World War II service Sea Cat was laid down on 30 October 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 21 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. E. L. Cochrane; and commissioned on 16 May 1944, Commander Rob Roy McGregor in command. After shakedown and trials off the New England coast, the new submarine departed New London, Conn., on 28 August and proceeded via the Panama Canal to Hawaii. Following training in Hawaiian waters, Sea Cat departed Pearl Harbor on 28 October and headed, via Midway and Saipan, for the South China Sea where she operated in a wolf pack which also included , , and . During the war patrol, Sea Cat fired torpedoes at two Japanese merchantmen which, together, displaced about 15,000 tons. Her commanding officer thought that they had both been sunk, but a postwar study of Japanese records did not confirm either sinking. After 61 days at sea, including 37 days in her patrol area, Sea Cat arrived at Guam for refit. The submarine got underway again on 1 February 1945 for her second war patrol which she conducted in the East China Sea in a wolf pack which included and . During operations off the coast of Ky≈´sh≈´, she damaged a 300-ton cargo ship by gunfire and attacked a 2,000-ton ship with torpedoes. Although she reported sinking the latter, Japanese records do not seem to support the claim. Sea Cat completed the patrol upon arriving at Midway on 24 March. On 27 April, the submarine sailed for the Yellow Sea where she and six other submarines preyed upon Japanese shipping. Sea Cat accounted for 400 tons of enemy vessels by gunfire, and she picked up two survivors of the sunken enemy ships for questioning before returning to Pearl Harbor on 25 June. She headed toward the Kuril Islands on 6 August for her fourth war patrol; but, upon arrival in her patrol area, learned that hostilities had ceased. She was ordered to proceed to the Japanese home islands and was in Tokyo Bay during the formal surrender ceremony on 2 September. Sea Cat earned three battle stars for her World War II service. She then sailed for the Marianas and reached Guam on 7 September. Following a brief stay at Apra Harbor, the submarine headed home. Following operations in the San Diego area into the spring of 1946, the ship proceeded to San Francisco Bay and arrived at Mare Island on 15 April 1946 for overhaul. Post War duties in Atlantic Yard work completed on 26 July, Sea Cat sailed back to San Diego, whence she departed on 12 August for her first simulated war patrol. On this cruise she visited Hawaii; Canton Island; Swains, Samoa, and Atafu Island; Tsingtao, and Shanghai. Then, transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, the submarine arrived at Balboa, Canal Zone, on 12 January 1947. After two and one-half years of exercises out of Balboa, her home port was changed to Key West in June 1949. In the autumn, it was decided to have a number of experimental changes made to the ship during her forthcoming overhaul, and she was redesignated AGSS-399 on 30 September. On 7 November, she arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where the work was done. The modifications and repairs were completed on 11 March 1950, and the submarine returned, via New London, to Key West. She operated from that base until she got under way on 9 January 1952 for Philadelphia and another overhaul. After her arrival on 15 January, she was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine and redesignated SS-399. Overhaul and conversion completed. Sea Cat departed Philadelphia on 26 June 1952 and returned to Key West. She operated from that base for the remainder of her career, spending most of her time in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and in waters off the southern coast of the United States. In July 1966, she interrupted her customary routine by crossing the Atlantic for a four-month deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Upon returning to Key West on 30 October, the submarine resumed her former routine and operated in Florida waters and the Caribbean until she was decommissioned on 2 December 1968 and struck from the Navy list on the same day. She was sold for scrapping, 18 May 1973.

His brother John Ballantyne (1774‚Äì1821) was also with the publishing firm, which is noted for the publication of the Novelist's Library (1820), and many works edited or written by Scott. Early life James was born in Kelso, Scottish Borders in 1772, the oldest son in a family of successful merchants. He attended Kelso Grammar School where he met Sir Walter Scott for the first time in 1783. Scott lived with his aunt briefly in Kelso when they met. They both shared a love of literature. James went on to attend Edinburg University to study law. He returned to Kelso in 1795 to become a solicitor. Publishing Although James was not raised in a printing family, he opened a printing office in 1796. On 13 April 1797, the first edition of the pro-Tory newspaper, The Kelso Mail, was published in which James was also the editor. Due to the newspaper being only weekly, he desired to work with those in the literary field who could use his services on the days he wasn't printing the Mail. In 1799, he begged Scott to write a few paragraphs for the newspaper on legal questions of the day. Scott then persuaded James to publish books as well as newspapers. That same year, James secretly printed An Apology for Tales of Terror and The Eve of St. John', which gave a start to Scott's writing career. This was the beginning of a partnership that would continue until Scott's death in 1832. Impressed with the typographical excellence of the first two published pamphlets, Scott offered James the rights to publish a collection of Border ballads that he had begun collecting. This collection was printed in 1802 as the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, which garnered great acclaim across England. It brought amazement as to such quality printing being done in such a small town. After this success, Scott urged James to relocate to Edinburgh. After training his younger brother, Alexander, to run the Kelso Mail, James moved to Edinburgh in 1803 where he and Scott set up a publishing office that would publish Scott's works. Alexander would eventually purchase all the rights to the Kelso Mail in 1806. Scott loaned him ¬£500 to help him get started and set up, which he did with two presses. These soon proved to be insufficient and the space too small with the amount of work coming in. He eventually settled his shop in Holyrood in 1805. Due to financial constraints despite the publisher's success, he joined into an ownership agreement with Scott who provided further capital. They had much success with the publishing of The Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel, Marmion and a number of other best sellers. In 1815, James married Christina Hogarth, with the condition from her father that he was debt free. Scott relieved James from his debts in return for complete ownership of James Ballantyne and Co. and James would work as a salaried manager. He became theatre critic of the Edinburgh Evening Courant. In 1817, James, along with his brother-in-law George Hogarth, purchased the Edinburgh Weekly Journal where he acted as editor. His brother, John, was the musical and drama critic while George managed the finances. 3,2,1 Heriot Row In 1820 he was living at 10 St John Street off the Canongate in Edinburgh's Old Town.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1820 Following the death of John Ballantyne in 1821, Scott promoted James from manager to personal agent and partner. This led to Alexander Ballantyne taking over the Weekly Journal as editor. While the company flourished with business from both Scotland and England and obtained a corner on printing legal stationary and official documents, debts continued to mount. Scott had been borrowing money to build Abbotsford House, his personal residence, instead of putting the money towards their debt. Afterr this change in circumstance James moved to a new house ayt 3 Heriot Row: a ground floor and basement house within the end pavilion.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1825 A collapse of the financial and publishing industries in 1825-26, led to the bankruptcy of Archibald Constable's publishing company who published Scott's works, also led to the failure of Ballantyne Press. This left James with responsibility for half of the company's debt, forcing him to sell his family valuables and new home. Scott publicly acknowledged his role in the business and used proceeds from his books to pay for the debts incurred. The debt was around ¬£120,000. Christina died in 1829 leaving James devastated. Scott died on 21 September 1832 followed shortly after by James on 26 January 1833. James' home address at the end of his life was 1 Hill Street in the centre of the city. Ballantyne Press was taken over by James son, John Alexander Ballantyne, along with John Hughes. The company's printing works ceased operations in 1916. Relationship with Sir Walter Scott James and Scott worked together for over 30 years and had a close, yet complex relationship. James played a very big part in the success of Scott as a novelist. Not only did he print all of his works, he would also act as an editor. James would proofread, point out inconsistencies in the text details, fix grammatical and punctuation errors, give the whole work a scrubbing and offer advice on language and style. James was a personal agent and partner. Scott trusted James to make edits and amendments even throughout the production process. Scott nicknamed both brothers, James and John, after characters in Henry Carey's burlesque Chrononhotonthologos. James was called Aldiborontiphoscophornio. Family James is the brother of John Ballantyne, who was his business partner at times. His wife's brother, George Hogarth, was a well-known music critic and writer. He was the uncle, through his younger brother Alexander, of R. M. Ballantyne, Scottish author and artist. His niece, Catherine Hogarth, was the wife of Charles Dickens.

Life Joseph was born in Paris, one of the 11 sons of Claude Delisle (1644‚Äì1720). Like many of his brothers, among them Guillaume Delisle, he initially followed classical studies. Soon however, he moved to astronomy under the supervision of Joseph Lieutaud and Jacques Cassini. In 1714 he entered the French Academy of Sciences as pupil of Giacomo Filippo Maraldi. In the next year he discovered Arago spot a century before Arago. Delisle mentions that when a small ball was illuminated by sunlight, the ball's shadow contained alternating bright and dark rings concentric with the center of the ball's shadow. Though he was a good scientist and member of a wealthy family he did not have much money. In 1712, he set up an observatory at the Luxembourg Palace and after three years moved to the Hotel de Taranne. From 1719 to 1722 he was employed at the Royal observatory, before returning to his observatory at the Luxembourg Palace. In 1724 he met Edmond Halley in London and, among other things, discussed transits of Venus.Wulf, Andrea. Chasing Venus: The Race to Measure the Heavens. New York City: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. 2012, Chap. 1. His life changed radically in 1725 when he was called by the Russian czar Peter the Great to Saint Petersburg to create and run the school of astronomy. He arrived there only in 1726, after the death of the czar. He became quite rich and famous, to such an extent that when he returned to Paris in 1747, he built a new observatory in the palace of Cluny, later made famous by Charles Messier. Also he received the title of Astronomer from the Academy. In Russia he prepared the map of the known North Pacific that was used by Vitus Bering. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1725 and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749. In 1760 he proposed that the international scientific community co- ordinate observations of the 1761 Transit of Venus to determine the absolute distance of the Earth from the Sun. He developed a map showing where on Earth this transit would be visible and thus where various observing stations should be located. Actual implementation of these observational efforts were hindered by the Seven Years' War. In 1763 he retired to the Abbey of St Genevieve, dying in Paris sometime in 1768. Expedition to Siberia In 1740, Delisle undertook an expedition to Siberia with the object of observing from Beryozovo the transit of Mercury across the sun. An account of the expedition is given in Volume 72 of the L'Histoire g√©n√©rale des voyages (1768).Continuation de l'Histoire G√©n√©rale des Voyages, ou Collection Nouvelle, 1¬∞. des Relations des voyages par mer, d√©couvertes, observations, descriptions, Omises dans celle de feu M. l'Abb√© Prevost, ou publi√©es depuis cet Ouvrage, 2¬∞. des Voyages par terre faits dans toutes les parties du monde, contenant Ce qu'il y a de plus remarquable, de plus utile & de mieux av√©r√© dans les Pays o√π les Voyageurs ont p√©n√©tr√©; avec les M≈ìurs des Habitans, la Religion, les Usages, Arts, Sciences, Commerce, Manufactures, &c.;, vol. 72, Paris: Chez Rozet, 1768, pp. 84‚Äì217. Delisle and his party set out from St. Petersburg on 28 February 1740, arriving in Beryozovo, on the bank of the River Ob, on 9 April, having travelled via Moscow, the Volga, and Tyumen. On 22 April, the date of the transit of Mercury, the sun was obscured by clouds, however, and so Delisle was unable to make any astronomical observations.Rozet (1768), p. 118. Delisle arrived back in St. Petersburg on 29 December 1740, having sojourned in Tobolsk and Moscow en route. =Non-astronomical scientific observations= Throughout the expedition, Delisle recorded numerous ornithological, botanical, zoological (e.g. the Siberian beaverRozet (1768), p. 120.), geographical, and other scientific observations. In the \\"Extrait d'un voyage fait en 1740 √† Beresow en Sib√©rie\\" published in the Histoire G√©n√©rale des Voyages, Delisle's ethnographic observations on the native peoples he encountered (the Votyaks,Rozet (1768), pp. 90‚Äì91.

Voguls,Rozet (1768), pp. 172‚Äì173. and ChuvashRozet (1768), pp. 198‚Äì203.) include details of their religious beliefs, marital customs, means of subsistence, diet, and costume. It seems that Delisle even planned to write a general study of the peoples of Siberia.Marie-Anne Chabin, \\"L'astronome fran√ßais Joseph-Nicolas Delisle √† la cour de Russie dans la premi√®re moiti√© du XVIIIe si√®cle,\\" in L'influence fran√ßaise en Russie au XVIIIe si√®cle, ed. Jean- Pierre Poussou, Anne M√©zin, and Yves Perret-Gentil, Institut d'√âtudes Slaves, Presses de l'Universit√© de Paris-Sorbonne, Paris, 2004, pp. 514‚Äì515. In Delisle's unpublished papers there is a document entitled \\"Ordre des informations √† faire sur chaque diff√©rente nation\\", which gives a structured outline of the ethnographic data to be collected for each particular Siberian nation: its history, geographical area, relations with other ruling powers, system of government, religion (e.g. belief in God, the Devil, life after death), knowledge in the arts and sciences, physical characteristics, costume, occupations, tools, mores, dwellings, and language.

The abbot recounted to Delisle that the previous year (1739) a Siberian merchant by the name of Fugla, already famous for his prodigious strength (he had fought and killed a bear with his bare hands), further added to his fame when he found near Yeniseisk an intact mammoth head \\"d'une grosseur √©tonnante.\\" Delisle himself was an indefatigable collector and during his Siberian expedition he took every opportunity to add to his \\"cabinet de curiosit√©\\", bringing back with him not only copies of manuscripts and mammoth bones like those he had seen in Tobolsk, but also \\"objets h√©t√©roclites,\\" which included items of Ostyak costume, a Samoyed quiver, a bark bucket, rare stones, and Tobolsk porcelain ware.Chabin (2004), pp. 516‚Äì518. The Atlas Rossicus The plan for a map of the Russian Empire was launched by Peter the Great, but did not come to fruition until two decades later, in the reign of Empress Anna.Chabin (2004), p. 512. Ivan Kirilov (1689‚Äì1737), the first director of the imperial Cartographic Office, had Delisle officially invited to Russia with a view to his collaborating on the proposed map of the empire.Leo Bagrow, History of Cartography, 2nd edition, revised and enlarged by R. A. Skelton, trans. D. L. Paisley, Chicago: Precedent, 1985, p. 175. However, Delisle and Kirilov clashed on how best to draw up the maps, with the former favouring the establishment of a network of astronomically determined points, a very time- consuming process, and the latter arguing for surveying based on geographical features as reference points, subsequently to be adjusted to the astronomically determined points. Using his own methods, but consulting Delisle for expert advice, Kirilov published in 1734 a general map and the first fourteen regional maps of an intended series of 120. The edition was abandoned after Kirilov's death in 1737. It was not until 1745 that the Academy in Saint Petersburg finally published a complete Atlas Rossicus, in Latin and Cyrillic script, consisting of a general map and 29 regional maps (–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π/Atlas Rossicus, Petropoli, 1745‚Äì1746). Delisle worked on the atlas in the 1730s, but his extreme scientific rigour considerably slowed its progress. For this reason, in 1740, while he was absent from the capital, undertaking his expedition to Siberia, Delisle was officially dismissed from the supervisory board in charge of the atlas. Schumacher, the secretary of the Academy, even went so far as to accuse him of sending secret documents to France. Increasingly isolated at court, Delisle requested permission to leave Russia in 1743, which was granted four years later. In the meantime, the Atlas Rossicus was submitted for publication in Delisle's name. In History of Cartography, Leo Bagrow argues that \\"by rights [the atlas] should not bear his name,\\" but Marie-Anne Chabin, an expert on Delisle's life and unpublished manuscripts, concludes: \\"Despite all, Joseph-Nicolas Delisle should be regarded as its main architect.\\" Legacy Delisle is mostly known for the Delisle scale, a temperature scale he invented in 1732. The crater Delisle on the Moon, and the asteroid 12742 Delisle are named after him.

Name Unlike other AFCs such as Sunderland A.F.C., the word Association was initially presented as part of the club name ‚Äì i.e. Thames Association or Thames Association FC. The \\"Association\\" was abbreviated upon joining the Football League, giving the team the more regular name of Thames AFC. History They were founded in 1928, in a similar manner to Sheffield United, Liverpool, New Brighton Tower and nearby Chelsea: to play on a ground which had no football club in residence. In Thames' case, they were formed by a group of businessmen who had built the West Ham Stadium, with a capacity of 120,000, in the Custom House area of Essex (now part of the London Borough of Newham in Greater London); the stadium was primarily used for greyhound and speedway racing which took place during the week, leaving Saturdays free. The directors of the stadium decided to form a professional football club to play on Saturdays, to bring in additional revenue to the stadium. The club began playing in the Southern League Eastern Division, and finished 14th in their first season and third in the season after that (1929‚Äì30). This was enough for them to gain election to the Football League Third Division South in the summer of 1930, in place of Merthyr Town. Their request to join the league was considered alongside applications from York City, Connah's Quay, Mansfield Town and Prescot Cables. The success of their application required them to suddenly upgrade the quality of the team. To achieve this objective, the newly promoted club placed an advert for \\"First Class Players Wanted. All Positions\\" in the June edition of the Athletic News. Thames continued to field a reserve side in the Southern League for a single further season, before withdrawing entirely in 1931. Thames' spell in the Football League was a short and unhappy one. The club struggled to attract spectators. It established a supporters group, which at one point had over 1,000 members. However, this effort did not translate into a reliable supporter base that would regularly attend matches. Despite the stadium's capacity of 120,000 (making it the largest ground in England to regularly host League football), the club holds the record for the lowest known attendance for a Saturday Football League match; just 469 fans paid to watch Thames play Luton Town on 6 December 1930. Unable to compete with established teams nearby, such as Charlton Athletic, Clapton Orient, Millwall and West Ham United, Thames struggled. By December 1931, the club was under severe financial pressure. To keep the club afloat, the players agreed to take a pay cut. They finished 20th out of 22 clubs in 1930‚Äì31, and 22nd (i.e., bottom) the following season (1931‚Äì32). This prompted the club directors' decision not to seek re-election to the League for the following season and wind up the club, despite an approach from Clapton Orient to merge the two clubs. They were replaced by Aldershot. Thames AFC should not be confused with Thames Ironworks FC, a club that had predated them by over 30 years, and would go on to be renamed West Ham United. Players Notable players for Thames included former England international Jimmy Dimmock, former Welsh internationals Len Davies and Moses Russell and ex-Arsenal striker Henry White. Eddie Perry went on to be a Welsh international. Colours Thames' home colours were red and blue quartered shirts with white shorts and black socks with red and blue trim. Cited in: Records and statistics Thames' record for their two seasons in the Football League was played 84, won 20, drew 17, lost 47, scored 107 and conceded 202.

It is a fast-paced play of dialogue-based action and situational humour. A young man Lomov comes to propose his neighbour Natalya but they both keep on fighting on various topics. Plot synopsis Ivan Vasilyevich Lomov, a long- time neighbor of Stepan Stepanovich Chubukov, has come to propose marriage to Chubukov's 25-year-old daughter, Natalia. After he has asked and received joyful permission to marry Natalia, she is invited into the room, and he tries to convey to her the proposal. Lomov is a hypochondriac, and, while trying to make clear his reasons for being there, he gets into an argument with Natalia about The Oxen Meadows, a disputed piece of land between their respective properties, which results in him having \\"palpitations\\" and numbness in his leg. After her father notices they are arguing, he joins in, and then sends Ivan out of the house. While Stepan rants about Lomov, he expresses his shock that \\"this fool dares to make you (Natalia) a proposal of marriage!\\" Natalia then realizes that Lomov wanted to marry her and immediately starts into hysterics, begging for her father to bring him back. He does, and Natalia and Ivan get into a second big argument, this time about the superiority of their respective hunting dogs, Guess and Squeezer. Ivan collapses from his exhaustion over arguing, and father and daughter fear he's dead, sending them into another round of hysterics. However, after a few minutes he regains consciousness, and Chubukov all but forces him and his daughter to accept the proposal with a kiss. Immediately following the kiss, the couple gets into another argument over their dogs. Performance history The Proposal was successful in its first runs in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and quickly became popular in small towns across Russia.Meister (1988, 185) and Senelick (1985, 209). Tsar Alexander III liked the play when he had it performed for him.Meister (1988, 184). Chekhov himself thought farces were not really worth much as literature; before its success, he called The Proposal a \\"wretched, boring, vulgar little skit\\".Meister (1988, 185). He advised its director, Leontiev, to \\"roll cigarettes out of it for all I care\\". When Vassar College staged The Proposal in the 1920s, they performed it three times in one evening, each with a very different staging: \\"as realism, expressionism, and constructivism\\". In the second version, played closer to tragedy, the actors were masked, and in the third the actors were all dressed in work suits in a playground, tossing a ball between them. In 1935 in the Soviet Union, the seminal Russian theatre practitioner Vsevolod Meyerhold combined The Proposal with Chekhov's other short plays The Bear and The Anniversary to form a three- act play called 33 Swoons that demonstrated the weakness of the pre- revolutionary intelligentsia.Senelick (214). In late June and early July, 2016, three performances of the play were performed at St. Werburgh's Church Parish Hall, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England. It was adapted for Australian TV in 1957. In 1976, Indonesian movie director/ writer making an adaptation with a title PINANGAN.

K. Gopalan or AKG, was an Indian communist leader, serving CPI with 16 members out of 489 since the first Lok Sabha in 1952.  Early life and education  Ayillyath Kuttiari Gopalan was born on 1 October 1904 in Peralasseri, Kannur District of Northern Kerala and educated in Tellichery. He was educated at Basel Evangelical Mission Parsi High School, Thalassery and at Government Brennen College, Thalassery. By the time he became a teacher, India's independence movement was becoming energised by Mahatma Gandhi. Gopalan took part in the Khilafat Movement which prompted a marked change in his outlook, transforming him into a dedicated full-time social and political worker. He was also involved in Moplah revolts.  Indian National Congress  In 1927 he joined the Indian National Congress and began playing an active role in the Khadi Movement and the upliftment of Harijans. He was arrested for participating in the salt satyagraha in 1930. While in prison he got acquainted with communism and became a member of the Congress Socialist Party and later the Communist Party of India when it finally took shape in Kerala in 1939. He led the hunger march from Malabar region to Madras in 1936 and the Malabar Jatha in support of the movement for responsible government in Travancore.  Further arrest  AKG with B.T. Ranadive The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 prompted an upsurge in activism against British domination, and Gopalan was again arrested. But in 1942 he escaped from prison and remained at large till the end of the war in 1945. He was arrested again shortly after the end of the war and was still behind bars when India became independent on 15 August 1947. He was released a few weeks later. Thereafter he was a member of Lok Sabha for 5 consecutive terms till his death on 22 March 1977 and became the one of the leaders of opposition parties in the parliament of India. During the Sino-Indian war in 1962, AKG along with other Indian communists like E.M.S. took an impartial view and requested both nations to discuss and settle the matter peacefully. The official leadership of the party at that time denounced this and supported the India Government. Many leaders of the left group were arrested with the support of the leadership of the party. When the party leadership blocked the publication of an article written by then General Secretary EMS condemning government for attacking the left leaders in the party using the cover of the war, he himself quit the post and supported the left group. AKG was part of the left group and faced disciplinary action by the party leadership dominated by the right. During this time a newspaper published a letter allegedly written by rightist leaders S.A Dange to the British during the freedom struggle. In this letter he promised to keep away from the freedom struggle if granted bail. This was used by the left group to beat the right. When the demand of the left to set up a party-level inquiry about the alleged letter of S.A Dange was rejected in the National Council of CPI, the left group walked away and formed a new Party. AKG joined the new break away faction, which later came to be known as Communist Party of India (Marxist). He also wrote extensively. His autobiography Ente Jeevitha Kadha has been translated into many languages. His other works include For Land, Around the World, Work in Parliament, and Collected Speeches, all in Malayalam.  Marriage  AKG was married to Susheela Gopalan, who was a prominent Marxist and trade union activist, from the Cheerappanchira family. His daughter, Laila, is married to P. Karunakaran, a former Member of Parliament for the Kasargod constituency.  Indian Coffee House  Statue of Gopalan in Kannur AKG played an important role in the formation of Indian Coffee House, a worker cooperative initiative by organising the thrown out employees of Coffee Houses of Coffee Board to establish ICHs in late 1950s.

In 1953, he was born in Hong Kong. In 1966, he immigrated to Canada with his whole family. Education and career In 1973, Hui entered the University of Alberta. In his second year he took a course on probability and statistics in which students were expected to learn the programming language APL with little or no formal instruction. He used all the time he could muster on a heavily burdened computer, and benefited from the APL360 User's Manual (the book APL Language was not published until March 1975). Because the manual was written by Adin Falkoff and Kenneth E. Iverson, Hui thinks it reasonable to say he learned APL from Falkoff and Iverson. As a summer student in 1975 and 1976, Hui worked at I. P. Sharp Associates (IPSA) in Calgary, on workspaces for statistical and probability calculations. The major attraction of the job was the unrestricted computer time with access to APL. After receiving a BSc degree with first class honors in computer science in 1977, Hui worked for two years as a full-time programmer and analyst in the new Edmonton office of IPSA, where his main duty was to support clients in their use of APL time-sharing. He attended the APL79 conference in Rochester, New York, where Iverson gave two papers: \\"The Role of Operators in APL\\" and \\"The Derivative Operator\\". On the way, Hui stopped at IPSA in Toronto and obtained a copy of \\"Operators and Functions\\" [IBM Research Report No. 7091, 1978]. He has been studying that paper and its successors ever since. In September 1979, Hui entered the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and received his MSc in May 1981 with a thesis on \\"The complexity of some decompositions in matrix algebra.\\" After completing his master's degree, Hui worked from 1981 to 1985 as an APL systems analyst and programmer for the Alberta Energy Company in Edmonton. In February 1982 Hui purchased A Source Book in APL (1981), in which the most memorable papers were \\"The Design of APL\\" (1973), \\"The Evolution of APL\\" (1978), and \\"Notation as a Tool of Thought\\" (1980). Hui's work was described at the APL85 conference in a paper, \\"DESIGN: A Financial Modelling System\\", written jointly with his supervisor, Fred Appleyard. The basic objects in the system were in \\"Direct Definition\\" (Iverson, 1976, 1980), and Falkoff and Iverson's The Design of APL was cited. Hui left Alberta Energy shortly after being promoted to a non-APL and non-programming position, and was out of work, and had no access to computers, from September 1985 to April 1986. This gave him plenty of time for intense study of Iverson's Rationalized APL (1983) and A Dictionary of the APL Language, as it was then named. J language In the early 1990s, Ken Iverson and Hui began collaborating on an advanced continuation of an APL-like language which they named J. The improvements were intended to fix some of the persistent character set issues that had plagued APL since its inception, and to add new advanced features such as support for parallel multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) operations. It was intended that the J language be an improvement over then extant APL. The J interpreter and language continue to evolve. In 1996, he received the Kenneth E. Iverson Award for Outstanding Contribution to APL. References External links *, JSoftware, creators of J Living people 1953 births Canadian computer programmers Hong Kong emigrants to Canada I. P.

It was Tobin's second album, the first released under his own name, and his first on the Ninja Tune label. The album was a departure from his first album, Adventures in Foam (as Cujo), incorporating a heavier blend of jazz melodies and intense jungle rhythms. The album was followed by Permutation in 1998. The album art for Bricolage depicts part of Alexander Liberman's Olympic Iliad sculpture, located at the base of the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington. Reception Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork gave Bricolage a maximum rating of 10/10, praising Amon Tobin for the way he produced an album of old jazz music with modern technology, such as samplers and electric keyboards. Sean Cooper of AllMusic stated that the album was consistently engaging and blurred the distinction between jungle and jazz. In 2015, Fact ranked the album at 23 on its list of \\"The 50 Best Trip-Hop Albums of All Time,\\" where they described it as a midway point between IDM and the \\"moodier landscapes\\" of several trip hop artists.

The missionary- era glyphs were logograms, with phonetic elements used alongside (Schmidt & Marshall 1995), which included logographic, alphabetic, and ideographic information. They were derived from a pictograph and petroglyph tradition.Edwards, Brandan Frederick R. Paper Talk: A History of Libraries, Print Culture, and Aboriginal Peoples in Canada before 1960. Toronto: The Scarecrow Press, Inc. 2004 p.11 In MiÍûåkmaq the glyphs are called komqwejwi'kasikl, or \\"sucker-fish writings\\", which refers to the tracks the sucker fish leaves on the muddy river bottom. Classification Scholars have debated whether the earliest known MiÍûåkmaw \\"hieroglyphs\\" from the 17th century qualified fully as a writing system, rather than as a pictographic mnemonic device. In the 17th century, French missionary Chr√©tien Le Clercq adapted the MiÍûåkmaw characters as a logographic system for pedagogical purposes. In 1978, Ives Goddard and William Fitzhugh of the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution, contended that the pre-missionary system was purely mnemonic, as it could not be used to write new compositions. In their 1995 book, David L. Schmidt and Murdena Marshall published some of the prayers, narratives, and liturgies represented by hieroglyphs‚Äîpictographic symbols‚Äîthat had been first developed by pre-contact Mi'kmaq, and then expanded on by French missionaries in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, to teach prayers and hymns. Schmidt and Marshall showed that these hieroglyphics served as a fully functional writing system, making it the oldest writing system for a native language north of Mexico. History Father Le Clercq, a Roman Catholic missionary on the Gasp√© Peninsula in New France from 1675, saw MiÍûåkmaw children writing hieroglyphics on birchbark. Le Clercq adapted those symbols to writing prayers, developing new symbols as necessary. Mi'kmak also used porcupine quills pressed directly into the bark in the shape of symbols. This adapted writing system proved popular among MiÍûåkmaq, and was still in use in the 19th century. Since there is no historical or archaeological evidence of these symbols from before the arrival of this missionary, it is unclear how ancient the use of the mnemonic glyphs was. The relationship of these symbols with MiÍûåkmaq petroglyphs is also unclear. The Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site (KNPNHS), petroglyphs of \\"life-ways of the Mi'kmaw\\", include written hieroglyphics, human figures, Mi'kmaq houses and lodges, decorations including crosses, sailing vessels, and animals, etched into slate rocks‚Äîattributed to the Mi 'kmaw who have continuously inhabited the area since prehistoric times. The petroglyphs date from the late prehistoric period through the nineteenth century. A Mi'kmaq healer Jerry Lonecloud, transcribed some of these petroglyphs in 1912, and donated them to the Museum.Whitehead, Ruth H. 2002 \\"Tracking Doctor Lonecloud: Showman to Legend Keeper\\". Goose Lane Editions, Fredericton Pierre Maillard, Roman Catholic priest, during the winter of 1737‚Äì38 created a system of hieroglyphics to transcribe MiÍûåkmaq words. He used these symbols to write formulas for the principal prayers and the responses of the faithful, in the catechism, so his followers might learn them more readily. There is no direct evidence that Maillard was aware of Le Clercq's work; in any event Maillard's work is outstanding in that he left numerous works in the language, which continued in use among the MiÍûåkmaq into the 20th century. An unknown number of birch scrolls containing MiÍûåkmaw writings were destroyed by missionaries in New England, before the writing system was adapted to aid conversion of community members to Christianity.

Stanier for general and hump shunting at the company's Derby Works using engine and electric equipment supplied by the English Electric Company.The Engineer, 14 July 1939 p. 45 col. 1 =Powertrain= The engine and generator were supported on girders attached to the main frame via a three-point suspension with rubber vibration absorbing pads; the generator was to the rear of the engine. The locomotive body was compartmentalised, with side doors and a sliding roof allowing access. Cooling was by a front-mounted radiator, with belt-driven fan cooling.The Engineer, 14 July 1939 p.45 col.3 The main generator was a direct current machine. Main control was via notched engine speed control (350, 465, 590, and 680 rpm), with finer control via secondary lever.The Engineer, 19 Jan. 1940 p.56 col.1 The engine was fitted with a governor preventing overspeed, and electric overload protection. The locomotive's mechanical transmission consisted of a single, frame-mounted traction motor powering a jackshaft drive via a reduction gear; the jackshaft drove all three driving axles via connecting rod and coupling rods. The locomotive was unusual in that most other English Electric diesel shunters (e.g. British Rail Class D3/6) had two axle-hung traction motors. The locomotive had an inner main frame similar to steam engine practice, with the axles supported by springs attached to the frame by tensioned rods, the centre axle had side play. The jackshaft was mounted in horn guides with the reduction gear totally enclosed on the left side of the locomotive.The Engineer, 14 July 1939 p.45 col.2 =Auxiliaries= An 80-volt battery was used to energise the main generator, as well as powering the electric control system and lights, and was also used to start the engine with the generator in motor mode. The battery was automatically charged when the engine was idling. An air compressor was powered via a belt drive from the generator. Compressed air operated the Westinghouse double-wheel tread brakes, as well as the sanding equipment and the whistle. History and numbering Initially 20 of the type were ordered on Lot 141 with a number of the new design put into operation at Toton sidings by mid 1939. An order for a further 20 units was placed on Lot 156 in 1939. These forty locomotives were given LMS numbers 7080‚Äì7119. Ten (7100‚Äì7109) were loaned to the War Department in 1941, and sold to the WD the following year. All ten survived the war; six were then sold to Egyptian Railways and four to Italian State Railways (Ferrovie dello Stato‚ÄîFS) where they were matriculated as Class Ne.700. The other 30 stayed remained in Britain and later became British Railways numbers 12003‚Äì12032. One, 12030 was withdrawn in 1964, with the remainder withdrawn during 1966/67, before TOPS classes were allocated.

It is one of Chile's southernmost towns, and has 4,734 inhabitants, including several thousand soldiers. It is the largest settlement in the Chilean half of the island of Tierra del Fuego. Porvenir (Spanish for \\"hereafter\\" ‚Äì literally \\"yet to come\\") was founded in 1883 by immigrants from Croatia and Chilo√© during a minor nineteenth century gold rush. The main sources of income are sheep farming and small scale fishing (wrecks in Porvenir bay prevent larger vessels from mooring). In addition there is a regiment of the Chilean army and a high security prison. An abattoir operates for only short periods of the year. Some gold deposits remain and are commercially mined. Porvenir also gives access to Cerro Sombrero, an oil town, east of Porvenir. Demographics San Francisco de Sales church According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Porvenir spans an area of and has 5,465 inhabitants (3,307 men and 2,158 women). Of these, 4,734 (86.6%) lived in urban areas and 731 (13.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 7.1% (361 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Porvenir is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2016-2020 alcaldesa is Marisol Andrade C√°rdenas . Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Porvenir is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Juan Morano (PDC) and Gabriel Boric (Ind.) as part of the 60th electoral district, which includes the entire Magallanes y la Ant√°rtica Chilena Region. The commune is represented in the Senate by Carlos Bianchi Chelech (Ind.) and Carolina Goic (PDC) as part of the 19th senatorial constituency (Magallanes y la Ant√°rtica Chilena Region).  Tourism  Porvenir in Tierra del Fuego Though tourism is expanding, most tourists pass Porvenir by, or use it simply as a stopover on their way farther south. There are several hotels, cyber-cafes, restaurants, and one gas station. A small grocery store is located near the Chilean army base on the upper level of the town, and there are several small stores and supermarkets elsewhere in town. Access is by ferry or by air from Punta Arenas or by road from the Argentine side of the island. All ferries across the Straits of Magellan are run by Austral Broom, a Chilean company. One service runs once daily except Mondays from the port near Punta Arenas and reaches the ferry terminal about 3 km from the town of Porvenir. The other service is at the northern end of the island running from Punta Delgada to Bahia Azul. It is possible to reach the south of Chilean Tierra del Fuego from Porvenir. The southern region has several lakes and rivers available for fishing.  Climate  The climate in Porvenir is a subpolar variety (K√∂ppen: Cfc) of the oceanic climate. Temperatures in the warmest months, January and February average 10 ¬∞C while temperatures in the coolest month average 2 ¬∞C. Precipitation is low at around 376 millimetres. Also, due to its latitude, the length of the day varies tremendously across the year. Winter days can have as few as seven hours of sunlight, while summer days stretch to twenty hours. Frost occurs throughout the year, and winter temperatures can remain below freezing for relatively long periods of time. Freak snowfalls can occur even in midsummer.

It may be used, reproduced, incorporated into other works, adapted, modified, translated or distributed under a public license provided that ICH's copyright is acknowledged. MedDRA is widely used internationally, with more than 6,200 subscribing organisations from over 125 countries. Each organisation, regardless of its number of users, requires only one subscription to MedDRA.  MedDRA Vision  In developing and continuously maintaining MedDRA, ICH endeavours to facilitate the exchange of clinical information through a single standardised international medical terminology which can be used for regulatory communication and evaluation of data pertaining to medicinal products for human use.\\"Vision for MedDRA\\" Content is copied from this source, which is ¬© ICH. It may be used, reproduced, incorporated into other works, adapted, modified, translated or distributed under a public license provided that ICH's copyright is acknowledged. As a result, MedDRA is designed for use in the registration, documentation and safety monitoring of medicinal products through all phases of the development life cycle. The single standardised terminology offers a number of clear advantages for regulators, industry and other stakeholders: * Removal of the need to convert data from one terminology to another preventing the loss and/or distortion of data and allowing savings in resources; * Improvements in the ease, quality and timeliness of data available for effective analysis, exchange and decision making; * Consistency of the terminology throughout the different stages of the development of a medicinal product allowing effective cross-references and analysis of data; * Facilitation of the electronic exchange of data relating to medicinal products.  Organization of the dictionary  The MedDRA dictionary is organized with a five level hierarchy. The highest or broadest level is System Organ Class (SOC), further divided into High-Level Group Terms (HLGT), High- Level Terms (HLT), Preferred Terms (PT) and finally into the most granular Lowest Level Terms (LLT). In addition, the MedDRA dictionary includes Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs). SMQs are groupings of terms that relate to a defined medical condition or area of interest.\\"Standardised MedDRA queries\\" Content is copied from this source, which is ¬© ICH. It may be used, reproduced, incorporated into other works, adapted, modified, translated or distributed under a public license provided that ICH's copyright is acknowledged. SMQs are developed to facilitate retrieval of MedDRA-coded data as a first step in investigating drug safety issues in pharmacovigilance and clinical development. Currently, over 100 SMQs have been created. Additional SMQs are created as the need arises.\\"Understanding MedDRA : The Dictionary for Regulatory Activities\\" Content is copied from this source, which is ¬© ICH. It may be used, reproduced, incorporated into other works, adapted, modified, translated or distributed under a public license provided that ICH's copyright is acknowledged. Individual cases are usually coded for data entry at the most specific (LLT) level, and outputs of counts or cases are usually provided at the PT level. The higher levels (HLT, HLGT and SOC) as well as SMQs are used for searching and for organising and subtotaling of outputs.  MedDRA hierarchy  The five level hierarchy provides degrees or levels of superordination and subordination. The superordinate term is a broad grouping term applicable to each subordinate descriptor linked to it. Hierarchical levels thus represent vertical links in the terminology.List of SMQs Topics Hierarchies are an important mechanism for flexible data retrieval and for the clear presentation of data. The five-level structure of this terminology provides options for retrieving data by specific or broad groupings, according to the level of specificity required. The Lowest Level Term (LLT) level provides maximum specificity. The terminology was not developed as a formal classification or taxonomy; each level in the hierarchy may reflect a variable degree of specificity or ‚Äúgranularity‚Äù from one System Organ Class to another. High Level Terms (HLTs) and High Level Group Terms (HLGTs) facilitate data retrieval and presentation by providing clinically relevant grouping of terms. Collectively, the HLT and HLGT levels are sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúgrouping terms‚Äù in MedDRA. The 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs) represent parallel axes that are not mutually exclusive. This characteristic, called ‚Äúmulti-axiality,‚Äù allows a term to be represented in more than one SOC and to be grouped by different classifications (e.g., by etiology or manifestation site), allowing retrieval and presentation via different data sets. Grouping terms are pre-defined in the terminology and not selected on an ad hoc basis by data entry staff. Rather, the terminology is structured so that selection of a data entry term leads to automatic assignment of grouping terms higher in the hierarchy. Multi-axial links of terms are pre-assigned in MedDRA, ensuring comprehensive and consistent data retrieval, irrespective of which SOC is selected at data retrieval. According to MedDRA 23.0 (March 2020): * SOC ‚Äì 27 ** The 27 SOCs are: Blood and lymphatic system disorders; Cardiac disorders; Congenital, familial and genetic disorders; Ear and labyrinth disorders; Endocrine disorders; Eye disorders; Gastrointestinal disorders; General disorders and administration site conditions; Hepatobiliary disorders; Immune system disorders; Infections and infestations; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications; Investigations; Metabolism and nutrition disorders; Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps); Nervous system disorders; Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions; Psychiatric disorders; Renal and urinary disorders; Reproductive system and breast disorders; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; Social circumstances; Surgical and medical procedures; Vascular disorders; Product issues * HLGT ‚Äì 337 * HLT ‚Äì 1737 * PT ‚Äì 24289 * LLT ‚Äì 81812  Maintenance of MedDRA  MedDRA is hierarchical, multiaxial, multilingual,\\"Multilingual MedDRA\\" Content is copied from this source, which is ¬© ICH.

She has presented numerous television programmes in Ireland and the UK. Early life When she was young Nolan's mother noticed that she always ran away when young males visited and rarely dated boys. She did eventually date two men. She joined a convent in the Sisters of Loreto, and has fond memories of her time there: \\"I loved the nuns and the work they did. They were the coolest group of women\\". She left after a drunken incident which confirmed for her that \\"the Catholic church has no place for women really\\". One year after leaving the nunnery, Nolan came out. Her mother asked her if she was gay one 1992 Saturday night about midnight when 22-year-old Nolan arrived home from her first night out in a gay bar. Her father was welcoming of her homosexuality, offering to accompany her on nights out if she wished and giving her the following advice, \\"Anna, never underestimate that there are people out there who hate gays, would like to hurt gay people and will never accept them. You don't have to mix with them, but they will always be there.\\" These words returned to her when she was filming for the BBC in Australia and was accosted by \\"an Australian right-wing homophobe living in Melbourne ‚Äì a very damaged character\\". Career Nolan came to prominence in 2000 as the runner up in the first series of the British reality show Big Brother. Her life as a lesbian ex-nun was central to the majority of the titillation in the first series in contrast with later series when, said the Irish Independent in 2007, \\"the freakshow has ratcheted to the point where Nolan would be deemed far too Waltons Mountain for Big Brother\\". She was present for a part of reality television history when Craig Phillips took on 'Nasty Nick' Bateman and his manipulative interferences. People ask her: \\"Are you Anna from Big Brother?\\" She used to deny this after losing interest but now she embraces her past. She describes her time in Big Brother as follows: \\"There were moments when I wanted to leave due to boredom, or people irritating me, or missing people at home. Did I enjoy it? It wasn't about enjoying it, it was about getting through it.\\" Prior to entering Big Brother, Nolan thought nobody would watch the show as she had discussed it with two friends and \\"One of them said, 'Why on earth would anyone want to watch that?' and we changed the subject\\". In June 2010, RT√â Ten named Nolan as one of its \\"Top 10 BB Housemates\\". After leaving the Big Brother house, she began working in television, paving the way for future Big Brother housemates who were to do the same, such as Jade Goody, Chantelle Houghton and Nikki Grahame. Nolan worked for the BBC on two series, Anna in Wonderland and Closure. She also began working for Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â). Nolan co-presented The Afternoon Show on RT√â One, along with Bl√°thnaid N√≠ Chofaigh. She spent three years presenting this. She announced in August 2006 that she would not be renewing her contract for the third series. She was replaced with first-season host (who was not present in season 2) Sheana Keane. Nolan has stood in for Marian Finucane on RT√â Radio, most memorably during the Kevin Myers \\"bastards\\" controversy in 2005, with the Irish media noting the irony of Nolan being a sister-in-law of Myers. In August 2006, Nolan was a presenter of the BBC programme Inside Out when the BBC North East and Cumbria crew filmed Anomalous Phenomena Investigations of Newcastle upon Tyne, conducting a paranormal investigation at Hurworth Grange Community Centre in Hurworth-on-Tees. The show aired on 30 October 2006. Nolan has been an occasional panellist on RT√â Two discussion show The Panel. From 2007 to 2009 she was a reporter for the RT√â series Would You Believe. She has cooked a meal on The Restaurant. She hosted Celebrities Go Wild with Aidan Power in October 2007. In December 2007, she presented Webs of Desire on RT√â One, during which she investigated the sexual possibilities of the internet, attended a fetishist club to discuss bondage discipline sado-masochism (BDSM) with a male person and interviewed an anonymous man who was accompanied by the caption \\"Individual Addicted to Porn.\\" In August 2010, Nolan featured in Ultimate Big Brother, during which Nikki Grahame felt her head. Nolan is now a television producer, and in 2011 produced the show Operation Transformation. She also produced reality show Mission Beach for RT√â. She writes a weekly column for the Evening Herald. In 2012, she directed her first documentary \\"Perfect Heart\\", about one man's wait for a heart transplant. She was series producer of the RT√â show \\"Room To Improve\\" in 2012. Nolan presents The Great Irish Bake Off for TV3 and she is the Development Executive for COCO Television. Personal life Nolan was in a long-term relationship with Dearbhla Walsh, an Emmy Award-winning drama director but in 2014 she told Brendan O‚ÄôConnor on The Saturday Night Show that she \\"had to adjust to being single\\". Big Brother host Davina McCall said that Anna Nolan was the only Big Brother housemate she ever befriended and that (in 2011) the two remained friends. Nolan has also maintained contact with Craig Phillips and Mel Hill. She was also supportive of Jade Goody during her cancer battle, and met her a number of times, even though they featured in separate series of Big Brother. Nolan, who was previously a sister in Dublin's Loreto Order, today considers herself an atheist. On 10 January 2010, she hosted a special one-off programme for RT√â One television entitled O Sister Where Art Thou? during which she attempted to track down and interview women with whom she had shared noviciate life in the order. At the end of the programme, while in conversation with a fellow former novice, she said: \\"I don't believe in God. I don't think there's a Heaven or Hell. I believe in the human spirit. I think we all make choices. I think we all have fears and for some people, when they get the fears or worries, they turn to a higher power. I just kind of deal with it. And when I go, that's it; I'm gone into the ground and 'goodbye world'. Which isn't depressing; some people might find it depressing. And I might be wrong and that's the good thing because if I'm wrong I'll get into heaven(!)\\".O Sister, Where Art Thou?

From the introduction: The difference ‚Ä¶ between this anthology and all previous anthologies of Scottish poetry -- is that some little effort has been made to present an \\"all-in view\\" of Scottish poetry and in particular to give some little representation to its Gaelic and Latin elements. It contained a number of ballads, and other anonymous verse; and translations from Latin and Gaelic. The introduction also makes the case for Lallans as a poetic language, contra Edwin Muir.

He also served as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation and President of the Naval War College. Early life and Civil War service Taylor was born in Washington, D.C.. He was appointed midshipman at the Naval Academy on 28 September 1860. When the Civil War expansion of the Navy engendered a pressing need for junior officers in the fleet, Midshipman Taylor's class was graduated a year early. He was commissioned ensign on 28 May 1863 and posted to the steam sloop operating with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In 1864, he was transferred to the sloop-of-war , in which he visited the Mediterranean and participated in the hunt for the Confederate raider . Postbellum service After the Civil War, Taylor served in a succession of ships on various stations. In 1866 and 1867, he was in with the North Atlantic Squadron, and he was assigned to from 1867 to 1868. His next tour of duty, in 1868 and 1869, was with the European Squadron in the storeship . Between 1869 and 1880, Taylor sandwiched two tours at sea in between two periods of shore duty. His first assignment ashore‚Äîin 1869, 1870, and 1871‚Äîwas at the Naval Academy. Following that, he was executive officer of , the flagship of the Pacific Squadron, from 1872 to 1874. Over the next three years, Lieutenant Commander Taylor commanded the Coast Survey steamer . In 1877, he came ashore once more, this time assigned to the Hydrographic Office. From there, he went to the Washington Navy Yard where he was serving at the time of his promotion to commander in December 1879.

It is south-east of the city of Napier. Access to the Cape by road stops at Clifton, which is the departure point for many tourists. The Cape Kidnappers Golf Course lies between the headland and the nearby coastal community of Te Awanga. History The headland was named after an attempt by local MƒÅori to abduct a member of Captain Cook's crew aboard HMS Endeavour, during a landfall there on 15 October 1769. The crew member was Taiata, the 12 year old nephew or servant of Tupaia, the Tahitian arioi who served as the Endeavour's interpreter and guide. Cook's journal states that Taiata was over the side of the ship when a Maori fishing vessel approached the Endeavour offering to trade fish, before seizing the boy and attempting to flee with him. Sailors from Endeavour‚Ä≤s deck immediately opened fire on the fishing boat, killing two MƒÅori and wounding a third. Taiata promptly jumped overboard and swam back to Endeavour, while the remaining MƒÅori paddled their craft back to shore. A 4-pounder cannon was fired after them from Endeavour‚Ä≤s quarterdeck, but the MƒÅori boat was soon out of range. Cook described the cape as having steep white cliffs on either side, with two large rocks resembling hay stacks near the headland. Following the passage of the Heretaunga Tamatea Claims Settlement Act 2018, the name of the headland was officially altered to Cape Kidnappers / Te Kauwae-a-MƒÅui. The MƒÅori portion of the name refers to 'the fish hook of MƒÅui'. Important Bird Area The cape has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for over 3000 pairs of Australasian gannets.

Legally the council is responsible for the financial affairs of the church parish and the maintenance of its assets, such as churches and church halls, and for promoting the mission of the church. History PCCs were created by the Rules for the Representation of the Laity scheduled to the Constitution of the former National Assembly of the Church of England (or Church Assembly), which was adopted by the Convocations of Canterbury and York in 1919.Halsbury's Statutes of England (1929) vol.6 p.59. Most of the remaining functions of the vestry meetings of parishes, and of the churchwardens of parishes, (i.e. those which had not been transferred to parish councils and other local authorities in the 19th century) were transferred to the PCCs by the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1921.11 & 12 Geo.5 No.1 (Measures passed by the Church Assembly, now replaced by the General Synod of the Church of England, are given the force of law by Act of Parliament, the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919.9 & 10. Geo.5 c.76) PCCs are now constituted under the Church Representation Rules (Schedule 3 to the Synodical Government Measure 1969). Powers and duties The powers and duties of PCCs are laid down by the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1956.4 & 5 Eliz.2 No.3 They include the duty to co-operate with the incumbent (rector or vicar) or priest in charge of the parish in promoting the mission of the Church in the parish. The PCC is responsible for the financial affairs of the church, and the care and maintenance of the church fabric and its contents, including demanding chancel repair liability from local inhabitants. These latter responsibilities are executed by churchwardens or other volunteers. It also has a voice in the forms of service used by the church and may make representations to the bishop and deanery synod on matters affecting the welfare and pastoral care of the parish.Diocese of Oxford PCC support page The PCC is required to appoint a church electoral roll officer who maintains the church electoral roll of lay members entitled to take part in the annual parochial church meeting. A new roll must be prepared every 6 years, and revised annually.Church Representation Rules , rule 1 Membership The constitution of a PCC is prescribed by the Church Representation Rules, rule 14. A PCC consists of (i) the clergy of the parish, (ii) certain lay readers and other lay workers licensed to the parish, (iii) the churchwardens of the parish, (iv) members of the General Synod, diocesan synod or deanery synod who are on the roll of the parish, and (v) a number of representatives of the laity elected at the annual parochial church meeting. To be qualified for election as a representative of the laity, a person must be of the laity, an actual communicant, aged 16 or over, and not disqualified (e.g. by conviction of certain offences, disqualification as a company director or entry on a \\"barred list\\"), and must be on the church electoral roll (and, unless under 18, have been on the roll for at least 6 months); he or she must be nominated and seconded by persons on the roll, and be willing to serve. Many parish post-holders are appointed by the PCC such as the secretary, treasurer and sidesmen. However, churchwardens must be elected at an annual Meeting of Parishioners pursuant to the Churchwardens Measure 2001. Churchwardens are ex-officio members of the PCC and its standing committee.

Early years Hermann was born into a wealthy aristocratic family of Jewish origin in Prague, Bohemian Kingdom (an old name of today's Czech Republic). Although his parents were formally Jewish, Hermann and his brother were educated as Catholics. Hermann studied at the German Gymnasium Na Prikopech (Prague) and then entered German Charles- Ferdinand University. Later he studied at universities in Berlin, Heidelberg and Vienna. In 1927, he received a PhD in philosophy in Heidelberg and in 1928 a PhD in law in his home-town Prague. Life in Prague and writer work After short juridical praxis, Grab became a music teacher and music-critic of Prager Montagsblatt. In 1934, he published the first of his short stories in Prague magazines and in 1935 his first book Der Stadtpark, a Prague novel, for he was said to be 'Prague Proust' (Joseph Strelka). Exile in the United States and death After the occupation of his country by Hitler between 1938 and 1939, Grab escaped to Paris. When Hitler's armies defeated France, he escaped (and lost all his manuscripts) through France, Spain, Portugal, and finally to the USA. Hermann settled in New York City and established a small music school, married a Belgian exile and wrote his second book Hochzeit in Brooklyn. Serious illness prevented him from returning to Prague after World War II. He died fully invalid in 1949 in New York and was buried at Flushing Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, New York City.

It flows from its source just south of Hamilton, Ontario to meet the Niagara River. History The river in a map from 1818 The river was originally called the Chippawa Creek since it drained into the Niagara River at Chippawa. Like many other places in Niagara, it was renamed by John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada in 1792. The present name was taken from the river of the same name in Lincolnshire, Eastern England. The Welland River is occasionally referred to as Chippawa Creek, especially by those in the Chippawa area itself. The Welland Canal was named after the river since it originally was planned to link Lake Ontario to Welland River. The city of Welland was later named after both waterways which crossed in the city. =O'Reilly's Bridge= The oldest structure spanning the Welland River was O'Reilly's Bridge, which was built in 1901 and crossed the river between the townships of Pelham and Wainfleet. The settler, Patrick O'Reilly, son of Sgt. John Reilly, of Stamford Township (present-day Niagara Falls), settled in Wainfleet in 1806. After meeting Sarah, the daughter of John Brown of Pelham Township, Patrick O'Reilly felled a couple of very tall trees across the River to shorten his journey to see her. A better bridge was built after they married and Patrick realized Sarah was frightened of walking along the logs. John Brown O'Reilly was their son who acted as Clerk of Wainfleet Township for many years. Over the years O'Reilly's Bridge saw many upgrades and improvements until it finally became the responsibility of the municipality. That is about the time O'Reilly's Bridge became a single-lane iron truss bridge, the only of its kind on the entire river, and one of the oldest iron truss bridges in Southern Ontario. O'Reilly's Bridge was demolished in 2010 and was replaced with a more modern, wider span. Geography The International Control Dam, as seen from the Canadian side of the border The river flows under two navigable aqueducts: the Welland Recreational Waterway and the new alignment of the Welland Canal. An important tributary of the river is Coyle Creek, a picturesque and thickly forested creek that flows into the river on the north bank. A stream of the river branches off shortly before its mouth. This canal quickly turns an open-cut hydropower channel through the city of Niagara Falls on its way to the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations in Queenston. It drains an area of . The International Control Dam, a weir in the Niagara River, causes the Welland River to reverse its direction twice a day when the flow of water over the Niagara Falls is reduced overnight and the water heads back up the river as far back as Wellandport. When the water flow is restored, the water direction of the Welland River changes once again to flow towards the Niagara River.

It separates the Old Town from the New Town. It is a place of representative buildings including the headquarters of the Czech National Bank, old palaces and luxurious shops. Na p≈ô√≠kopƒõ is the most expensive street among the all states of the V4. In 2017, with the amount of rent 2,640 euros (67,480 CZK) per square meter per year, ranked on 22nd place among the most expensive shopping streets in the world. History Tram line on the street in 1890 Na P≈ô√≠kopƒõ street leads on the site of former 10-meter-wide and 8-meter-deep moat from 1234, which led along the medieval walls of the Old Town. Water flowed directly from the Vltava river and when the moat was filled, the Old Town formed a closed island. The moat was covered in 1760. After covering, chestnut trees were planted here and the street was named Ve star√Ωch alej√≠ch (In old alleys). In 1845-70 the street was named Kolowratsk√° t≈ô√≠da and since 1871 bears the name Na P≈ô√≠kopƒõ. Because it was one of the few very wide streets in Prague, it soon became a traffic artery. Since 1875, the first line of the Prague horse-drawn tram has been lead here, which has been electrified since 1899. In 1919, M≈Østek became the first intersection in Prague to be controlled by a traffic policeman. In 1927, then the second intersection with the light signaling (the first being Hybernsk√°-Dl√°≈ædƒõn√°- Havl√≠ƒçkova intersection). In the 1960s, traffic jams were getting worse. However, in 1978 the metro station was opened at M≈Østek, and Line B followed the street since 1985 for almost its entire length to the Republic Square. Nearly century-old tram line was canceled in 1985 and the bustling urban street turned into a pedestrian zone. On the street appeared many new stores and it became an important business center of Prague promenade.

Holders of these positions are ex officio members of the parish board, usually called a vestry, parochial church council, or in the case of a Cathedral parish the chapter.  Responsibilities of office  Churchwardens have a duty to represent the laity and co-operate with the incumbent (or, in cases of vacancy, the bishop). They are expected to lead the parishioners by setting a good example and encouraging unity and peace. They have a duty to maintain order and peace in the church and churchyard at all times, and especially during services, although this task tends to be devolved to sidesmen.Clements 2018, pp14-16. Churchwardens in many parts of the Anglican Communion are legally responsible for all the property and movable goods belonging to a parish church. If so, they have a duty under ecclesiastical law to keep an up-to-date inventory of the valuables, and if applicable a \\"terrier of the property\\" (map of the churchlands, some of which may be let). Whenever churchwardens authorise work on the church building having obtained a faculty or to carry out work recommended in the church's Quinquennial Inspection Report,Clements 2018, pp143-149 they must record this in the Church Logbook; it is inspected with the inventory. The churchwardens must ensure these logs are ready for inspection in case of a visitation and for periodic inspections. Priests and their equivalent tend to devolve day-to-day maintenance of church buildings and contents to their churchwardens. If an incumbency is vacant, the bishop (or the Archdeacon acting on his or her behalf) will usually appoint the churchwardens as sequestrators of the parish until the bishop appoints a new incumbent. The sequestrators ensure that a minimum number of church services continue to be held in the parish, and in particular that the Eucharist continues to be celebrated every Sunday and on every Principal Feast. They tend do this by organising a regular rota of a few volunteer clergy from amongst either Non-Stipendiary Ministers from within that diocese or in some cases retired clergy living in or near the parish. The bishop will tend to consult the churchwardens before appointing a new priest to take over the parish; in England there is a set process to follow which also involves representatives of the congregation.Clements 2018, pp102-106. Churchwardens' duties may vary with the customs of the parish or congregation, the canons of the diocese to which the parish belongs, the desires of the priest, and the direction of the parish board or the congregation as a whole. A definition of their duties is that they are \\"ultimately responsible for almost everything in a church which does not have to be done by a priest. If the churchwarden does not do it himself, then he is responsible for making sure that it is done by someone\\".Clements 2018, p12. = Powers = In England, churchwardens have specific powers to enable them to keep the peace in churchyards. The following are punishable with a ¬£200 fine: * riotous, violent, or indecent behaviour in any cathedral church, parish or district church or chapel of the Church of England or in any churchyard or burial ground (whether during a service or at any other time) * molesting, disturbing, vexing, or troubling, or by any other unlawful means disquieting or misusing: ** any preacher duly authorised to preach therein, or ** any clergyman in holy orders ministering or celebrating any sacrament, or any divine service, rite, or office, in any cathedral, church, or chapel, or in any churchyard or burial ground. The churchwarden of the parish or place where the offence was committed may apprehend a person committing such an offence, and take them before a magistrates' court. In practice this means they should be aware of these offences and may be expected to conduct a citizen's arrest until police arrive, if appropriate. Until 2003, the offence was punishable by up to two months' imprisonment. However, caution is advised in the use of this power.Clements 2018, pp16-18.  Types of churchwarden  Historically, there are two main types of warden: the people's warden(s) (and assistants, if any) are elected annually by the congregation as a whole (at what is called the Annual Vestry Meeting or \\"meeting of the parishioners\\"); the rector's warden(s) (and assistants, if any), are appointed by the incumbent. However, this distinction has been abolished in several areas of the Anglican Communion in favour of both wardens being appointed jointly (notably in England, although the incumbent retains the right in some circumstances to appoint one warden). In some jurisdictions (but not in England) where a parish temporarily has no priest, is not self-supporting, or in which the parish board has been dissolved, wardens are appointed directly by the bishop and are called \\"bishop's wardens\\". The only areas in which wardens almost always have no authority, often proscribed by canon, are music and liturgy, which are considered to be under the exclusive authority of the priest or bishop in charge of the parish. Nevertheless, in England churchwardens have authority to officiate at Morning and Evening Prayer if a priest or licensed lay person is unavailable.  Churchwardens by country  = Church of England = In the Church of England, churchwardens are officers of the parish and officers of the bishop. Each parish elects two churchwardens annually (unless an existing custom in place on 1 January 2002, and which has continued since before 1 January 1925, states otherwise) and they are elected on or before 30 April and are sworn in between being elected and 31 July the same year. Churchwardens are (re-)elected annually at the Meeting of Parishioners and can serve a maximum of six years followed by a two-year break unless the rule is previously suspended by the Meeting of Parishioners. A few Anglican churches, for historical reasons outlined above, have three churchwardens instead of the usual two; two such examples are All Saints, West Ham and St Margaret's, Barking. Historically, there are also a few churches which retain four churchwardens with St. Mary's, Ecclesfield, Sheffield, as an example. Some churches may appoint Assistant Churchwardens to help them. These are distinct from Deputy Churchwardens who have a precise role in certain limited cases. The terms \\"Honorary Churchwarden\\" or \\"Churchwarden Emeritus\\" are sometimes bestowed on retiring churchwardens; these are purely honorary terms and do not allow such a holder to continue to sit unelected on the PCC.Clements 2018, p29. = Church of Ireland = One Church Warden is appointed by the incumbent, whilst another is elected by the Easter General Vestry. Both serve for one year terms, during which they are ex officio members of the select vestry. As well as performing some logistical functions normally associated with a sexton or verger, church wardens have certain constitutional rights and responsibilities: they may convene and chair meetings of the General Vestry or Select Vestry (but only under certain circumstances), and their consent is required for the use of any experimental forms of service and for any visiting ministers who are not in full communion with the Church of Ireland. Church Wardens are also responsible for overseeing the collection during the Offertory, for the presentation of the bread and wine to the officiating priest during Holy Communion, and for the safe custody of church plate. = Episcopal Church in the USA = The canons of some US dioceses permit or mandate the election of all wardens, in which case they are usually referred to as the \\"senior warden\\" and the \\"junior warden\\". Sometimes, however, the senior warden is known as the \\"rector's warden\\" and the junior warden, the \\"people's warden\\". In some of the latter cases, the rector's warden is chosen by the rector, while the people's warden is elected by the congregation. Wardens serve for a fixed term, normally one to two years, and are usually automatically members of the parish canonical committee, commonly called the \\"vestry\\", and sometimes automatically delegates to the diocesan synod, or convention, as well. = Anglican Church of Southern Africa = The duties of churchwardens in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (ACSA) are detailed in Canon 29 of the Canons and Constitution of the ACSA, as follows. Churchwardens are the officers of the Bishop and the principal representatives of the congregations. Together with the Incumbent they constitute the executive of the Parish Council and have special responsibility in the following matters: * to ensure that a register is kept of all parishioners; * to keep an inventory of all goods, ornaments and furniture belonging to the church, to provide for the safety and preservation of the registers and to deliver the same to their successors on ceasing to hold office; * to execute the policy of the Parish Council relating to property and parochial finance; * to be responsible for the preparation of annual estimates of revenue and expenditure and the presentation of accounts to the Vestry; * to see to the seating of the congregation, without respect of persons; * to aid the Incumbent with information and counsel in all matters relating to the Parish, and particularly in cases contemplated in the rubrics before the service of Holy Communion. * to complain to the Bishop or Archdeacon if there should be anything plainly amiss or reprehensible in the life or doctrine of the Incumbent and also if there be anything contrary to order or decorum in the administration of Divine Service. Additional duties and responsibilities may also be specified in the various dioceses of the Province.

It runs for a total of 164 kilometres southeast from the Kaweka Range, Kaimanawa Range and Ruahine Range and then east before emptying into Hawke Bay roughly halfway between the cities of Napier and Hastings, near the town of Clive (drainage area 2,000 square kilometres above Tutaekuri River confluence). The river is mostly a single-thread channel down to Whanawhana (45 kilometers from the coast), flowing through a greywacke rock gorge. Below Whanawhana, the river opens to wide braided channel and is joined by the Maraekakaho River. The Ngaruroro shares a river mouth with the Tutaekuri, Clive River and Muddy Creek. The meeting of these rivers forms the Waitangi Estuary. The Ngaruroro is one of several rivers that helped form the alluvial Heretaunga Plains at the south end of the coast of Hawke Bay. The course of the Ngaruroro has changed several times, originally flowing down what is now the Clive River. It changed to much of its present course in 1867 during a major flood. In 1969, the bottom 4 km of river was diverted more directly to the coast (near Pakowhai Road) in an effort to reduce flooding. The Karamu and Clive remain as rivers, but drain a smaller catchment. About 40% of the catchment is pasture, and 55% native forest. The upper Ngaruroro drains the Kaweka Forest Park and it is used for trout fishing (mostly rainbow), rafting, tramping and deer hunting. The Ngaruroro River recharges freshwater to the Heretaunga groundwater aquifer (in the order of 4 cubic metres per second). This aquifer feeds several streams in the area (e.g. Raupare, Irongate), in addition to pumping that supports extensive orchards of the Heretaunga Plains. Eventually the aquifer discharges to the sea in submarine springs some 20 km off the coast.Grant, P.J. 1965.

It is initiated by an artificial and forcing 2 response by the passed hand to a 1 or 1 opening by partner. The 2 bid shows at least 3-card support for opener's suit with 10-12 support points and asks opener to clarify the strength of his opening hand. The convention is also known in Europe as \\"Toronto\\". Origins and purpose The convention was developed by Canadian Douglas Drury (1914-1967) Drury moved from Toronto, Canada to San Francisco, California in the late 1950s and his then playing partner Eric Murray (1928-2018) to manage Murray's propensity to open light in third seat. On page 44 Murray is quoted: \\"We invented the convention to handle my light third hand openings.\\" Page 40 of the Biographies and Results CD. Opening light (i.e. with marginally less than normal values) in the third seat is a common and effective bidding tactic because the player in the fourth seat may well have the best hand at the table and be poised to open the bidding given the opportunity. A third seat light opening, especially in a major suit, will act preemptively to make it harder for that player to enter the bidding. However, this creates two problems: # a simple change of suit is no longer a forcing bid and # responding partner, already a passed hand, is unsure if his opening partner has a normal or light opening and any jump response could get the partnership too high. The traditional method for showing good support for opener's suit is to jump to the 3-level (e.g., 1 - 3). On those occasions when partner has opened light, this may result in an overly ambitious contract, despite the good support. Drury allows responding partner to learn if his opening partner has opened with a normal opening hand or has a light opening hand. If it is a light hand, or even a minimal normal opening hand, the contract can be set at the 2-level, whereas non-Drury partnerships, with the same hands, would have to sign-off at greater risk at the 3-level. Owing to its role in the competitive bidding of part-score contracts, Drury is advantageous primarily in match point scoring events. Opener's rebid =Original Drury convention= The convention was first published in The Bridge World in January 1957. Murray's presentation of the original convention included the following features: # The Drury Two Clubs is an artificial one- round force by a passed hand responding to partner's third or fourth-hand major suit opening bid # With a normal opening bid, opener rebids normally but with a light opening hand, he negatives with 2 # With a distributional hand containing length in opener's major but with fewer than 9 HCP, responder preempts by jumping to 3 in opener's suit =Reverse Drury= A rebid of 2 shows a full opening. While not universally accepted, a bid of 2 by opener after opening 1 is also a weakish bid showing 5 spades and 4 hearts (or better). With a good hand (say 15 or more points) opener may simply jump to game (4 of the major suit). Other bids tend to be natural and descriptive, in effect a game try. With an excellent hand, opener may be interested in a slam and will bid accordingly. Responses by the Drury bidder after the sequence 1M-2C-2D After opener confirms a full opening hand, the following sequence of rebids is helpful to allow opener to decide whether game is possible. The Drury bidder responds to 2: *2 - I have a minimum Drury hand *2 - I have a maximum Drury hand but only 3 trumps *2NT - I have a maximum Drury hand with 4 trumps Two-way Drury In this variant, the passed hand with 10+ points responds 2 to show exactly 3-card support and 2 to show 4-card support or better. This may help opener evaluate the probability of a successful game contract. Real club (or diamond) suit If the passed hand has 10+ points and a real club suit (or a diamond suit, when playing two-way Drury), this cannot be shown naturally at the 2-level. One possibility is that a jump to 3 (or 3) shows this hand. An alternative is to use the forcing notrump. A third possibility (and the one recommended when the convention was introduced) is to bid 2, then rebid three of the minor. If this last approach is used, opener must be careful about jumping in own suit without extra length. Variation for 4-card major systems The above examples are suitable for use with 5-card major systems such as Standard American. Variations are required for use with 4-card major systems such as Acol.

It holds and interprets artifacts from the Prehistoric, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods, mostly from the city of Thessaloniki but also from the region of Macedonia in general. The building and the exhibitions Interior The museum is housed in a building designed by architect Patroklos Karantinos and is an example of the modern architectural trends of Greece. Built in 1962, the museum had a new wing added to it in 1980, in which the findings from Vergina were displayed, up until 1997. In 2001 and 2004, in the run-up to the 2004 Athens Olympics, the museum was extensively renovated and its permanent exhibits reorganized. The statue of Harpocrates (Roman era). The central rooms hold exhibits from the archaeological excavations conducted in Thessaloniki and the broader area of Macedonia. The new wing hosts two exhibitions: The Gold of Macedon, with artefacts from the cemeteries of Sindos, Agia Paraskevi, Nea Filadelfia, Makrygialos, Derveni, Lete, Serres, and Evropos; and The Thessaloniki Area in Prehistory, with material from prehistoric settlements, dating from the Neolithic to the Early and Late Bronze Age. At present, the collection of Archaic to Late Roman sculptures from Thessaloniki and Macedonia in general is displayed in the central section of the museum. They illustrate the history of Thessaloniki from prehistoric times to Late Antiquity. These rooms display architectural members from an Ionic temple of the 6th century BC, sculptures of all periods from Macedonia, exhibits from the excavations in the palace complex built by Galerius in the Thessaloniki city centre, a reconstruction of the fa√ßade of the Macedonian tomb in Agia Paraskevi, with genuine architectural members, and finds (mainly gold artefacts) of the Archaic and Classical periods from the Sindos cemetery. In all these rooms, certain important exhibits have been singled out and further information about them is given to help visitors appreciate the importance of each exhibit and of the area and the period from which it comes. Apart from its permanent displays, the Archaeological Museum also hosts major temporary and thematic exhibitions. In the Manolis Andronikos Room, for instance, there is an exhibition titled The Coins of Macedonia from the 6th Century to 148 BC, with examples of coins that were circulating in Macedonia in that period. A showcase in the lobby of the museum displays some finds from the excavation of the Neolithic settlement at Makrygialos in Pieria, accompanied by information about the progress of the excavation. In the new wing, the Gold of Macedon exhibition includes finds from numerous excavations in Central Macedonia. Taking the history of gold as its central theme, it presents the culture of Macedonia from the 6th century BC to 148 BC, discussing the use of gold (jewellery, sartorial decoration, gilding of objects and vessels, coins), the technology of the manufacture of gold jewellery, and the techniques of gold mining. There are also numerous finds from cemeteries, and their role in burial customs is described. The Thessaloniki in Prehistory exhibition aims to recreate a picture of the Thermaic Gulf littoral before the city of Thessaloniki was built. It presents the first excavations, which were carried out during the First World War by British and French troops, and finds from the most important prehistoric settlements in the area (Thermi, Vassilika, Stavroupoli, Oraiokastro, Assiros, Toumba, and Kastana) divided into three chronological groups (Neolithic, and Early and Late Bronze Age). Museums of Macedonia web site = Discovery of possible original statue of Alexander = On 26 February 2010, Greek authorities arrested two men found in illegal possession of various antiquities, including a bronze statue of Alexander, which is possibly a work of Lysippos. If confirmed, this would make it the first original work of Lysippos ever discovered. The statue is currently being examined at the laboratory of the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, which is expected to confirm or deny its authenticity.

She was the lead singer of the pop trio Mecano, considered one of the most popular pop bands from Spain during the 1980s and 1990s. Mecano split in 1998 and she embarked on a solo career. Biography Ana Torroja met Jos√© Mar√≠a Cano while studying economics at university. The two became good friends, and Jos√© Mar√≠a soon introduced her to his younger brother, Nacho. After hearing Ana sing Jos√© Mar√≠a's guitar compositions, Nacho suggested that the three form a band. In 1981, Mecano was formed. After seven Mecano albums and huge success in Europe and Latin America, the continuous touring began taking its toll on the band. Ana was especially affected and started developing vocal problems. In 1993, the band announced a temporary split. While Jos√© and Nacho released solo albums, Ana chose to travel around the world and visited Hawaii, Bombay, and New York City‚Äîplaces she had sung about while with Mecano. She eventually settled in New York and took dance classes. By 1997, Ana felt confident enough to sing again and moved to London to record her first solo album, Puntos Cardinales (Cardinal points). The album, produced by Tony Mansfield, marked a curious change for Ana. Because her new songs were not written from a male point of view‚Äîunlike the Mecano hits written by the Cano brothers‚Äîshe felt that she could express herself as a woman for the first time. The first single from the album, A Contratiempo, was a Spanish-language cover of an old Bette Midler song, \\"Bottomless\\". Both the album and the single went to No.1 in Spain. In 1998, partially due to the cost and commercial failure of Jos√© Mar√≠a's opera project, Mecano reunited for the double-disc greatest hits compilation Ana, Jos√©, Nacho, which also featured seven new songs. Ana's biggest solo success came in 1999 with her album, Pasajes de un Sue√±o (Passages of a dream). This album was hailed by critics and the first single, \\"Ya No Te Quiero\\" (\\"I don't love you anymore\\" or \\"I don't want you anymore\\"), became one of the best-selling songs in Spain that year. As a part of the promotion of this album, Torroja undertook, together with Miguel Bos√© the Girados tour in May 2000, throughout Spain, the United States, and part of Latin America. The tour concluded at the beginning of the following year. In 2001, Ana tried to reconquer the French audience she had won over at the time of Mecano, recording the album Ana Torroja. She then took part in the recording of the disc Duetos 2 by the Mexican artist Armando Manzanero, with whom she recorded the song \\"Nada personal\\" (\\"Nothing personal\\"). In 2003 she published her third album Fr√°gil (Fragile), in which she presented a more genuine pop-based image. For the album, she appeared for the first time solo on stage, in a brief tour across America and Europe called the Gira Fr√°gil (Fragile Tour). It was this material that consolidated her success as a solo artist, and with which she also obtained numerous nominations and prizes such as the Grammy Latino, Shangay (Spain) and Oye (Mexico). Shortly afterwards, she took a brief break from her musical career, guesting with artists such as Mexican singer, composer, and keyboard player Aleks Syntek in 2004. She dueted with Syntek on the song \\"Duele el Amor\\" (\\"Love hurts\\"), which was a major commercial success. That same year she did a duet with Italian singer Gigi D'Alessio, a new song called \\"Bacio\\" (\\"kiss\\") in Italian, a cover of the same song also sung by Gigi D'Alessio with Anna Tatangelo. In 2006, Ana released a new studio album called Me Cuesta Tanto Olvidarte, produced by Syntek. The album contained new versions of old Mecano hits. The first single was \\"Los Amantes\\", which reached No. 2 on the Spanish charts. In 2008, Ana decided to work with Schiller, singing Por qu√© te vas, which went to Number One in the Sehnsucht album charts in (Germany). On 17 May 2008, Ana Torroja was invited by Aleks Syntek to take part in the macro concert of the Fundaci√≥n ALAS, in aid of children in Latin America. She sang \\"Me cuesta tanto olvidarte\\", \\"Duele el amor\\", \\"Corazones\\", and \\"Te amar√©\\" (alongside all the invited artists). On 10 October 2008, she was seriously injured in a car crash in C√°diz, from which she fully recovered. Ana's music has managed to spread further than just France and Germany. In 2010, British singer Jack Lucien announced that he had covered her song \\"Hoy ya no te quiero\\" for his forthcoming third studio album. In October 2010 Ana released Sonrisa (Spanish for smile), her fifth original studio album in Spanish. The album was produced by the Venezuelan Andr√©s Levin, who also produced her second album. The recording of the album started in 2008, the album being originally scheduled for release in March 2009. The release had however been delayed due to her car accident in 2008. So far Sonrisa has been met with favourable reviews.

Born in Derbyshire in the United Kingdom, Smith enlisted in the army of the East India Company at the age of 23. Posted to India in 1839, Smith served through various campaigns, earning the Victoria Cross in 1857 at the Siege of Delhi. Smith died from dysentery in 1864.  Life and career  Smith was born in Ashby Road, Ticknall, Derbyshire, in February 1814. After working as a cordwainer like his father and uncle, Smith enlisted with the private army of the East India Company in London on 3 October 1837. Following his training at the East India Company's depot in Chatham, Smith embarked for India. Arriving on 2 August 1839 Smith was posted to the Bengal Sappers and Miners, subsequently arriving at the headquarters in Delhi then joining the 3rd Company of the Bengal Sappers and Miners. Smith was promoted to Sergeant in 1840. Smith, then with the 5th Company of the Bengal Sappers and Miners in November 1841, served in a force under Brigadier Wild, taking part in the advance on Ali Masjid in the Khyber Pass. Smith then served throughout the 1842 campaign in Afghanistan, taking part in the successful storming of the Khyber Pass; the occupation of Jelalabad and the occupation of Kabul. Smith later rejoined the Headquarters of the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Delhi, and was shortly afterwards transferred to 7th Company, with whom he served in the later part of the Sutlej campaign. Smith was present at the battle of Sobraon and was awarded a medal for this. Posted to the 3rd Company, Smith served through the Punjab campaign in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, being present at the siege and capture of Multan and battle of Gujerat. For this service Smith was awarded the Punjab Medal with two clasps. Smith was posted in 1851 to work with the Superintending Engineer of the Punjab, in the Department of Public Works, as an Acting Assistant Overseer attached to the Mian Mir Division, eventually becoming an Assistant Overseer in 1854. Smith was ordered to return to his regiment in 1856, and due to an error in the carrying out of this order Smith was mistakenly posted, at a reduced rank of Gunner, to the 3rd Company of the 4th Battalion of Bengal Artillery. Smith successfully protested against the order, leading to its rescinding and Smith being sent back to the Bengal Sappers and Miners at his former rank of Sergeant. Smith remained at the depot in Rurki until the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in May 1857 when the a force from the Bengal Sappers and Miners were ordered to the immediate aid of the station at Meerut. The arrival of this force at Meerut on 13 May 1857 was met with hostility, and the Meerut authorities demanded that the Bengal Sappers and Miners be disarmed, leading to the mutiny of a large number of the force (killing their commanding officer in the process) which then left to join the rebels at Delhi, leaving 45 Non-commissioned Officers and Privates, and 124 loyal Indian sappers. After two weeks at Meerut, this group was ordered to join the Delhi Field Force, with Smith serving in operations through the siege.  Victoria Cross  Blowing up of the Cashmere Gate at Delhi, 14 Sept. 1857, steel engraving Smith was 43 years old, and a sergeant in the Bengal Sappers and Miners, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 14 September 1857 at Delhi, British India, Sergeant Smith with two lieutenants (Duncan Charles Home and Philip Salkeld) and Bugler Robert Hawthorne showed conspicuous gallantry in the blowing in the Kashmir Gate in broad daylight under heavy fire. His citation reads:  Later career  Smith spent 1858 engaged in operations in Oudh and was awarded the Indian Mutiny Medal with \\"Delhi\\" clasp. In July 1859 Smith was appointed Sub-Conductor and acting Barrack Master for Jullundur and Phillour. Smith was promoted to Ensign on 17 March 1860. and later served as Barrack Master at Peshawar, Subathu and Darjeeling, returning in January 1864 to general duties at Amballa. While on leave in Jullundur, Smith contracted dysentery there and died on 26 June 1864, following which he was buried in the Artillery Cemetery in Jullundur. The location of Smith's Victoria Cross medal is unknown. A memorial plaque commemorating Smith was placed on the wall of Ticknall Village Hall in 2014.

Cardiac muscle consists of individual heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) connected by intercalated discs to work as a single functional organ or syncytium. By contrast, skeletal muscle consists of multinucleated muscle fibers and exhibits no intercalated discs. Intercalated discs support synchronized contraction of cardiac tissue. They occur at the Z line of the sarcomere and can be visualized easily when observing a longitudinal section of the tissue. Structure Three types of cell junction make up an intercalated disc ‚Äî fascia adherens, desmosomes and gap junctions. * Fascia adherens are anchoring sites for actin, and connect to the closest sarcomere. * Desmosomes stop separation during contraction by binding filaments, joining the cells together. Desmosomes are also known as macula adherens. * Gap junctions allow action potentials to spread between cardiac cells by permitting the passage of ions between cells, producing depolarization of the heart muscle. Molecular, biological, and comprehensive studies have shown that intercalated discs consist for the most part of mixed type adherens junctions, termed composite junctions or areae compositae (singular area composita). These represent an amalgamation of typical desmosomal and fascia adherens proteins (in contrast to various epithelia). Thus cardiomyocyte adherens junctions differ from epithelial adherens junctions and desmosomes. Rupture Ruptured intercalated discs, in this case regarded as a visual artifact.

It was founded in 1919. Before World War II it manufactured large variety of goods, including Minox - then the world's smallest camera. After the war it was the leading communication technology producer in the Soviet Union and the largest factory in Latvian SSR.  History  Street view of VEF's oldest buildings. VEF was established in April 1919 as Postal and Telegraph Department's repair workshops. It was named () (PTVGD). In 1924 the factory was moved for the first time, and in 1928 moved again to its VEF's current location. The factory buildings were built in late 19th and early 20th century and span a city block. Before World War I the buildings were owned by 1887-established factory UNION. The company was renamed to VEF in 1932. In 1922 PTVGD started to manufacture phones. In 1924 it started producing crystal-detector radios. In 1928 it began producing automatic telephone exchanges. They bought the license from Mix & Genest to produce small volume (for 100, 200, 300 numbers) and large volume (1000, 2000 numbers) switchboards. Telephone exchange in Riga and Latvia's populated places were upgraded with equipment manufactured by PTVGD until 1940. During the 1930s the monthly production of PTVGD included 500 phones and 400 exchanges. By the 1930s the factory produced all electronics that had any market demand - communication devices, phones, light bulbs, cameras, irons, radios, flashlights, as well as photo paper, work-tables, and even airplanes. They also repaired cars. VEF entered the world market in 1936 with the development of the Minox subminiature camera, designed by Walter Zapp (). It was the world's smallest camera at the time. Between 1928 and 1933 VEF also produced a small, inexpensive car. During World War II the factory was looted and several buildings were blown up. The factory was repaired after the war and it quickly recovered. During the 1960s VEF produced seven radios receivers and five phones every minute and two out of three phones in Soviet Union were produced by VEF. It also manufactured highly demanded transistor-based radios \\"Spƒ´dola\\" and in the 1970s ‚Äî \\"VEF\\". During the Soviet period, VEF specialized in electronics and was a part of Latvia's electronic industry, which supplied the former Soviet Union with telecommunications equipment and electronics for the military. The five largest state companies were VEF, Radiotehnika, Elfa, Komutators and Elar (which produced components for the other four). In its peak in 1991, VEF employed 20,000 people. Its best known products were telephones, telephone exchanges and radios. The Latvian electronics industry had trouble competing with Western companies when the markets were opened in the early 1990s. Cited problems included poor service and product quality. Attempts to restructure these companies were not successful and their combined production fell more than 90% between 1993 and 1997. VEF was divided into six smaller companies, most of which no longer exist. Three remaining ones, VEF un Ko, VEF TELEKOM and VEF Radiotehnika RRR, employ between 100 and 200 people each.

Storing (January 28, 1928 ‚Äì September 9, 1977) was an American political scientist with broad ranging interests who is best known for reviving the serious study of the American Founding Fathers. The renowned constitutional theorist and American politics scholar Walter Berns called him \\"the most profound man I have encountered in the field of American studies.\\"  Career  Storing received his A.B. degree from Colgate University in 1950. He then attended the University of Chicago, earning his A.M. in 1951 and Ph.D. in 1956. His dissertation chair was C. Herman Pritchett and he studied with Leonard D. White, Robert Horn and Leo Strauss. He was a Fulbright Scholar to the United Kingdom from 1953 to 1955 and also received research grants from the Rockefeller, Ford, and Relm Foundations and from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Storing served as senior research assistant at the London School of Economics; as assistant, associate, and professor of political science at the University of Chicago (1956‚Äì77) where he worked closely with Joseph Cropsey; and as director of the Telluride summer program at the Hampton Institute in 1967. He was Visiting Charles Evans Hughes Professor of Jurisprudence at Colgate University from 1968 to 1969, and part-time professor of political science at Northern Illinois University from 1969 to 1975. Storing helped write speeches for President Gerald Ford and, together with Martin Diamond, testified before Congress regarding the Electoral College. At the time of his death in September 1977, Storing was Robert Kent Gooch Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia, where he also served as director of the Study of the Presidency at the White Burkett Miller Center for Public Affairs. He was also a member of the President's Commission on White House Fellows.  Thought and scholarship  = American Founding Fathers = Prior to Storing, 20th-century scholars tended to study the American Founding Fathers from the standpoint of historicism, contextualism, and ideological history. The approaches characterized the political thought of all of the founders as tethered to the extant practices and opinions of the late 18th and the early 19th centuries. Characteristic of that approach was Charles A. Beard‚Äôs Economic Interpretation of the Constitution, which maintained that \\"the structure of the Constitution of the United States was motivated primarily by the personal financial interests of the Founding Fathers.\\" In contrast, Storing helped create a new approach to the American founding within the fields of political science and political theory, one whose principles held that the thought of the American founders could and should be understood as relevant to the contemporary study of politics. For Storing, that meant engaging with the arguments of the founders on their own terms, as opposed to reading those arguments primarily in light of the social, political, and economic conditions that likely shaped them. Storing by no means denied the relevance of these conditions in attaining an informed view of what the founders thought. Indeed, as Storing emphasizes in his essay, \\"The Other Federalists,\\" most writers from the founding period were bound to the consensus opinions of their times. What distinguished Storing's approach was his openness to founding thinkers like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, who saw further and thought more deeply than their contemporaries did about the nature of political life and institutions and so whose thought cannot simply be reduced either to personal motivations or shared opinions. Emblematic of Storing's concern with the founding is his treatment of the Federalist-Anti-Federalist debates, to whose study he contributed his seven-volume study, The Complete Anti-Federalist, which was described by a The New York Times reviewer as \\"a work of magnificent scholarship\\" and its publication a \\"civic event of enduring importance.\\" Storing believed that the debate illuminated the deepest commitments of the American regime because the Anti-Federalists felt it was in their interest to expose the true character of the new constitutional order. The debate was made profound because the critique of the proposed constitution developed by the most thoughtful of the Anti-Federalists, such as Brutus, forced the Federalists to give a more sophisticated defense of their creation than they might otherwise have done. For Storing, the issues raised in this debate, some of which were unresolved at the time and remain unresolved today, pertain to the essential nature of the American regime, and are therefore of enduring relevance to scholars of all aspects of American politics. = Race and politics = Storing began teaching and writing about race and politics well before the topic became important for the field of political science. For example, Storing published his first writing on race and politics, \\"The School of Slavery: A Reconsideration of Booker T. Washington,\\" in 1964, whereas the Race, Ethnicity, and Politics section of the American Political Science Association was not founded until 1995. His singular contribution was to show how black Americans are naturally in the position to see the American regime more clearly than do white Americans. For Storing, the lens through which black Americans view their country can \\"provide a clean, sharp view of America, exposing its innermost and fundamental principles and tendencies, which are largely ignored or vaguely seen through half-closed eyes by the majority of white Americans, whose circumstances do not compel them to look at their country and to wonder about it.\\" Because black people experience political, social, and economic alienation in ways that white people do not, they are in a position \\"to take seriously the possibility of revolution, or rejection, or separation. [They] thus [share] the perspective of a serious revolutionary.\\" Seeing the American regime as a genuine revolutionary means appealing \\"from the imperfect world of convention and tradition‚Ä¶to the world of nature and truth. In important respects, then, black Americans are like a revolutionary or‚Ä¶a founding generation‚Ä¶[T]hey are in the difficult but potentially glorious position of not being able to take for granted given political arrangements and values, or having seriously to canvass alternatives, to think through their implications, and to make a deliberate choice.\\" Relatedly, Storing articulated and developed Frederick Douglass‚Äô critique of the constitutional theory that was (ironically) shared by the radical abolitionists‚Äîsuch as William Lloyd Garrison‚Äîand the defenders of slavery‚Äîsuch as Roger Brooke Tawney. Following Douglass‚Äô insights, Storing contended that while peripheral elements of the 1789 Constitution either maintained slavery‚Äîthe \\"three-fifths clause\\"United States Constitution, Article 1, section 2 and the \\"fugitive slave clause\\"United States Constitution, Article 4 section 2‚Äîor tacitly acknowledged it‚Äîthe clause prohibiting the outlawing of the slave trade until after 1808United States Constitution, Article 1 section 9‚Äîthe core elements of the Constitution were progressively egalitarian. = Public administration and the public interest = Storing emphasized the importance of the common good, as opposed to the mere aggregation of competing goods, in thinking about how individuals and groups relate to the polity to which they belong. As a consequence, Storing developed a searching critique both of the idea of scientific administration and of theories of pluralism and group politics. For Storing, \\"[j]ust what specific civil rights and duties flow from government‚Äôs origin in natural rights is by no means obvious and thus defines much of the task of both lawmakers and jurists in a liberal political order.\\" For this reason, genuine political judgement is an essential component of both interest group politics and public administration. In this regard, Storing questioned theories of interest group politicsToward a More Perfect Union, pp. 259-268 and public administrationToward a More Perfect Union, pp. 327-351 which sought to diminish the role of political judgement and to emphasize the promise of purely scientific‚Äîi.e., non \\"value-based\\"‚Äîdeterminations as to how resources ought to be distributed in a regime. Specifically, Storing challenged \\"the radical disjunction between deciding what to do (politics determining the end) and actually carrying it out (administration fixing the means).\\"Toward a More Perfect Union, p. 11 In respect to the American constitutional order in particular, Storing argued (contrary to many scholars of constitutional law and the American founding) that founders such as Hamilton and Madison had a developed sense of robust administration and that the constitutive choices they made in framing the architecture of the American regime prefigured and set in motion what many today call \\"big government.\\"Toward a More Perfect Union, pp. 287-306 Unlike their Anti-Federalist opponents who believed that \\"republics had to be small enough that citizens would identify their private interests with the public good and would willingly carry out the laws with little need for governmental compulsion or force,\\"Toward a More Perfect Union, p 10; Jeffrey K. Tulis, The Rhetorical Presidency, New ed. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017) p. 26 n. 2 Storing showed that leading Federalists were committed to a political future in which uniform and effective administration would not depend on citizens‚Äô private virtue, but rather would be guaranteed by the workings of a carefully designed central government.Toward a More Perfect Union, p. 4 = Statesmanship and the American presidency = In his writings on statesmanship and the American Presidency, Storing \\"sketches the essential elements of democratic statesmanship and their grounding in the American constitutional order.\\"Toward a More Perfect Union, p. 11 Storing questioned the views that the American presidency is either a purely administrative institution designed merely to carry out the will of the Congress (thereby fulfilling the ancillary role described and critiqued by Richard NeustadtRichard Neustadt, Presidential Power (New York: The Free Press, 1990)) or that the President is a unitary executive with discretion on its own, and accountable to no other elements in the regime (e.g., the Congress) besides the people at large. Storing argued that \\"[t]he beginning of wisdom about the American presidency is to see that it contains both principles [i.e., the administrative and the political] and to reflect on their complex and subtle relation.\\"Toward a More Perfect Union, pp. 371-372 Following Hamilton in the Federalist, Storing sought to elucidate why energy is so fundamental to executive power and how the institutional design of Article II induces energetic presidential leadership in its office holders; he also sought to explain how the presidency is designed not merely to serve popular will but, at times, to discipline and direct it. Relatedly, Storing distinguished between different conceptions of statesmanship and how they relate to constitutional government. In particular, he identified \\"old\\" statesmanship as political leadership that actually forges and imposes a political identity and ethical norms on a people‚Äîi.e., the kind of leadership exercised by the American founders. This he distinguished from a narrower form of statesmanship that is compatible with constitutional liberalism and its toleration of diverse conceptions of the good life.Jeffrey K. Tulis, \\"The Possibility of Constitutional Statesmanship,\\" in The Limits of Constitutional Democracy (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009) p. 113  Personal life and teaching  Storing was born on January 29, 1928, in Ames, Iowa. His father, James A. Storing, was a professor, Provost and, for a time, acting president of Colgate University. He served in the U.S. Army after World War II, from 1946 to 1948. Storing was an unusually dedicated graduate teacher and adviser.Memorial of Herbert J. Storing by Ralph Lerner, 1978. PS 11, 1 (Winter, 1978): 113-114 (available at https://jmp.princeton.edu/sites/jmp/files/in-memoriam-diamond-storing.pdf) As his close friend Walter Berns recalled, \\"It seemed to me that he must have served on at least half of the [University of Chicago political science] department‚Äôs dissertation committees, a disproportionate number as chairman. At any rate, I have a memory of manuscripts piled on his desk awaiting his attention. Unlike some professors I have known, Storing read them all with great care. His students will attest to this.\\" Storing regularly provided his graduate students with further opportunities to learn outside of the classroom, hosting extra-curricular seminars as well as reading groups.Memorial of Herbert J. Storing by Ralph Lerner, 1978. PS 11, 1 (Winter, 1978): 113-114 (available at https://jmp.princeton.edu/sites/jmp/files/in- memoriam-diamond-storing.pdf) As his colleague Joseph Cropsey wrote: \\"Storing was a powerful, extremely influential teacher. The forthrightness and uprightness of the scholar in his writing were forcefully manifest in the man as presence. His logic straightened his thought without hardening his heart; his students learned from his example the difference between sentiment and sentimentality.\\"\\"Foreword\\" to Toward A More Perfect Union, p. ix.

Little Stoke is a suburb of north Bristol, situated in South Gloucestershire, England. It is surrounded by Patchway, Stoke Gifford and Bradley Stoke. Home to Patchway railway station, a minor stop on the railway network, the railway line separates Little Stoke from the large Rolls Royce factories in nearby Filton. A road tunnel (under the railway) linking the two, has seen many accidents over the years, due to it being low in height and very narrow. Little Stoke is home to a large playing field and a community hall. The community hall is now home to a caf√© - ‚ÄòLittle Stoke Community Cafe‚Äô - which has been a huge hit with Little Stoke residents. Near the railway arch are some local shops including a post office. Many of the road names are linked to engines produced in the 1950s and 1960s at what is now the Rolls- Royce factory. The area originally consisted of many council houses and post World War II prefabs. In recent years, some of the houses have been renovated; however, some owners have kept the older style of house. Little Stoke has one Public House, The Stokers (formally The Magpies), on Gipsy Patch Lane, and one Social Club (Little Stoke Social Club), on Braydon Avenue. School children attend Little Stoke Primary School and then move on to AbbeyWood High School, on New Road in nearby Filton; or to the nearby Patchway High School. Some pupils travel further afield to Bradley Stoke Community School in Bradley Stoke The Ridings High School in Winterbourne or to The Castle School or Marlwood School (in Thornbury and Alveston respectively).i Stoke Gifford Parish Council gained notoriety amongst the running world when it became the first council to vote to impose a charge on runners who run at Little Stoke parkrun every Saturday morning. parkrun organises free running events in over 800 parks worldwide and this was the first and only council to take this step when it made its decision on 12 April 2016 by a vote of 6 to 4. The Parish Council cited wear and tear on paths as its justification.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-36030582 Because of this, Little Stoke parkrun has now closed. Little Stoke has a football team called Stokeside FC who play in the Bristol & District League as well as Little Stoke F.C who currently play in the Gloucestershire County League and Stoke Lane, which gets its name from the road Stoke Lane, which runs through Little Stoke. The club's home shirt for all the teams is black and white stripes.

For example, (using Acol or Standard American bidding) if opener, with around 16-17 HCP, bids 1 and partner responds 2 (showing 6 ‚Äì 9 support points) opener is in a quandary: if responder has a maximum strength hand, with well-positioned high cards, then game will probably make; but the information revealed so far is not accurate enough for either partner to decide whether to play in game or only part score. Originally, opener would make a game try by bidding 3 (inviting game) and responder would then bid game with maximum (8-9) points or pass with minimum (6-7) points. Modern game try bids permit more accurate decision-making. Following a simple raise by partner (e.g. 1 ‚Äì 2), opener bids a new suit either to show extra values or to ask responder to show more about his values. There are a variety of methods to do so including long suit, short suit, or help suit game tries and partnership agreement is required. Whichever method is adopted, responder and opener will collaborate to evaluate the additional information and make one of the following choices: sign off in three of the agreed major; jump to game in the agreed major; jump to game in notrump if the suit is a minor; or make a counter try in yet another new suit. When opener has a very strong hand, slam investigation may also be undertaken. With a major suit fit Prior partnership agreement is needed to determine which variety of game try is being used: * Long suit game try ‚Äì After a single raise, opener shows extra values by bidding a second suit naturally at the lowest level (e.g. 1 ‚Äì 2; 2 or 1 ‚Äì 2; 3). Responder can promote length and/or high-card values in that suit, or shortness combined with an extra trump, and jump to game. Conversely, responder with weakness in opener's second suit should sign off. * Short suit game try ‚Äì With this agreement, opener bids a short suit (singleton, void, or perhaps a doubleton) at the lowest level, showing extra values and, by implication, side length in the unbid suits. * Help suit game try ‚Äì This agreement is similar to the long suit game try, but slightly more precise. Responder should envision opener holding three small cards in the new suit (although the holding may in fact be better, perhaps as good as KJx). Then, regardless of point count, responder bids game with zero or one loser in that suit and signs off with three losers in that suit. With two losers in that suit, responder bids according to point count. * Counter try ‚Äì If responder cannot bid game based on opener's game try suit, but has a good holding in a different suit, this can be bid as a counter try provided it can be bid at a level below 3 of the agreed suit, thus 1 ‚Äì 2; 2 ‚Äì 3 is allowable but 1 ‚Äì 2; 3 ‚Äì 4 is not. This in effect says, \\"I cannot accept the invitation based on your suit, but if you had asked in this suit, I would have.\\" Opener can then re- evaluate based on this new information and either sign off or bid game. * 2NT game try ‚Äì a less common alternative method is to use the rebid of 2NT as a game try. By agreement, this may be natural, or may be a game try showing solid holdings in the side suits and a weak trump suit, or may have some artificial meaning. * 2-way / 3-way game try ‚Äì It is possible to combine long, short and even general strength-based game tries using the following (after 1M-2M): Step 1 = Short suit game try, asking responder to show a singleton, or bid step 1 otherwise, after which opener will show the suit he is short in, with 3M being a surrogate for spades (if hearts agreed) or clubs (if spades agreed). Step 2 = General game try, asking responder to show 6 to 8 points via a step 1 to 3 response, or to bid 3NT with a flat maximum and 4M with any other maximum. Step 3 to 5 = Long (or 'Help') suit game tries with 3M (step 5) being a surrogate try in spades (if hearts agreed) or clubs (if spades agreed). With a minor suit fit Because 11 tricks are required for a minor suit game, most players prefer to investigate the possible optimum contract of 3NT before settling for a minor suit contract (game or part score) and thus a trial bid new suit shows a stopper in that suit for NT purposes, e.g.: 1 ‚Äì 2; 2 shows game going strength and a stopper in spades If opener has a weak hand When using any of the above methods of game tries, it is common that a rebid of three of the agreed suit is not a game try, but a preemptive strategy intended to inhibit the opponents from entering the auction. Responder must pass, as in this example: 1 ‚Äì 2; 3 ‚Äì Pass. If opener has a very strong hand If opener has such a good hand that a slam seems possible even following a single raise by partner, then more information about responder's hand can be obtained by using a game try bid. If responder rejects the game try, opener can sign off in game. If responder accepts the game try, then opener can further investigate the slam. Other methods of \\"trying\\" for game * Fourth suit forcing (conventional and forcing) ‚Äì When one of the players (normally responder) can see that game looks likely (25 HCP having been shown by the bidding) but no obvious contract is apparent, bidding the fourth suit can be used to elicit more information from partner. Thus holding: and with this unopposed Acol bidding: 1 ‚Äì 1; 2 ‚Äì ? game should be possible but is it 4 (if partner has a 3-card spade suit, yes) or 4 (if partner has a 6-card heart suit, yes) or 3NT (if partner has A10x in diamonds, yes)? Bidding the fourth suit (1 ‚Äì 1; 2 ‚Äì 2; ?) asks partner to give new, useful information to clarify the situation. * Invitational bids (natural limit bids, non- forcing) ‚Äì Either as part of, or following, suit agreement, bids at a level one below game are generally considered to be invitational, thus in Acol: 1 ‚Äì 2; 3 ‚Äì ? and 1 ‚Äì 3; ? are both invitational to a 4 game contract. The invitation should be accepted (game should be bid) with maximum points and declined (by passing) with minimum. For suit contracts this method has largely been supplanted by game try bids as above. However, it is still widely used for NT contracts, thus 1NT ‚Äì 2NT is invitational to bid game in 3NT * Stayman convention ‚Äì At its simplest a 2 response is used following an opening bid of 1NT to enquire whether opener has a 4-card major suit. Depending on the answer, responder will pick the best game contract. *Long suit game tries -- This may also be known as 'help suit game try'. In practice, Where the length or strength of major potential contract suit is in doubt, this convention is an attempt to determine whether a secondary suit fit may be enough to proceed to game.

It is the seat of the Archbishops of Tours, the metropolitan cathedral of the Tours ecclesiastical province. It was built between 1170 and 1547. At the time construction began, the church was located at the south end of the bridge over the Loire, on the road from Paris to the south-west of France. It has been a classified monument historique since 1862. Evolution =History= The first cathedral, dedicated to Saint Maurice, was built by Lidoire, Bishop of Tours from 337 to 371 (preceding Saint Martin). Burnt down in 561, it was restored by Gregory of Tours and rededicated in 590. Its location, at the south-west angle of the castrum, as well as its eastern orientation, resulted in the original access being through the late-Roman surrounding wall (such a configuration is quite rare).Configuration also found in Soissons after Soissons Cathedral was rebuilt and extended during the 13th century. View of the nave The cathedral was then rebuilt as a Romanesque church during the second quarter of the 12th century but almost immediately burnt down again in 1166 during the conflict between Louis VII of France and Henry II of England (also count of Anjou, the adjacent region). The present cathedral replaces the earlier 12th-century Romanesque building. The first phase concerned the south transept and the towers, as early as 1170. The chancel was rebuilt from 1236 to 1279 by √âtienne de Mortagne but the nave took much longer to build. The architect Simon du Mans rebuilt the transept and started the nave, including six spans, aisle and chapel, built during the 14th century ‚Äî the first two spans correspond to those of the old Romanesque cathedral and date back to the 12th century. The nave was only finished during the 15th century by architects Jean de Dammartin, Jean Papin and Jean Durand, thanks to the generosity of Charles VII and the Duke of Brittany Jean V. Cathedral plan During the construction of the present cathedral, the nave was extended westward and the towers surrounding its entrance were erected during the first half of the 16th century, the first tower in 1507 by Pierre de Valence 87 m high, and the second tower during 1534 and 1547 by Pierre Gadier. Highlighting the special feature of the building, called supra, the towers were erected outside of the old city. The late-Roman surrounding wall is visible in cross section at the rear of the towers from the north. In 1356, the cathedral was re-dedicated to Saint Gatianus. Its construction having been particularly slow led to a local saying: \\"... not until the cathedral is finished\\", to mean something particularly long and difficult to achieve. It also meant that the building presents a complex pattern of French religious types of architecture from the 13th century to the 15th. For example, the tower buttresses are Romanesque, the ornamentation generally is pure Gothic, and the tops of the towers are Renaissance (beginning of the 16th century). Treasures The organ, donated by Martin de Beaune, was built by Barnab√© Delanoue in the 16th century. The cathedral also contains the tomb of the children of Charles VIII and Anne of Brittany, who died as infants. This tomb, in Carrara marble, made by Girolamo da Fiesole, in the Italian style, the recumbent statues on which are reminiscent of the 15th- century French medieval tradition (school of Michel Colombe), was kept from 1506 in the Basilica of St. Martin before being moved in 1834 to its present location. Environment To the north of the cathedral is a small cloister, also built during the Renaissance. This cloister is known as the clo√Ætre de la Psalette, in reference to its function as a school of psalms (religious chants). To the south of the cathedral is the former archbishop's palace, built in the early 18th century, which has now become the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Tours.

He was born in Ireland; his family immigrated to Chester County, Pennsylvania, in 1729. Smith attended the Philadelphia Academy. He studied law at the office of his brother George and was admitted to the bar in Pennsylvania, initially practicing near Shippensburg, and later near York. He became captain of the militia there. He was appointed to the provincial convention in Philadelphia in 1775, to the state constitutional convention in 1776, and was elected to the Continental Congress. He was reelected to Congress in 1785 but declined to attend because of his advanced age. The surname Smith is probably anglicized from the Irish surname McGowanhttp://www.ancestry.com/facts/mcgowan-family-history.ashx Smith died on July 11, 1806, and is buried in York, Pennsylvania, First Presbyterian Churchyard.

He is most remembered for his candidacy as the Republican nominee in the close and contentious Chicago mayoral election of 1983. Biography =Early life and career= Epton served in World War II in the U.S. Army Air Force, for which he flew twenty-five missions over Germany and twice earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. During the postwar years, Epton became a successful attorney with a speciality in insurance law. A graduate of the University of Chicago and DePaul University College of Law, he was an unsuccessful liberal Republican candidate for U.S. Representative from Illinois' 2nd congressional district in 1960. With John F. Kennedy narrowly winning Illinois that year, Epton lost to the Democratic incumbent, Barratt O'Hara. Known for being witty and occasionally sharp-tongued, Epton was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1969 and served until 1983. He chaired the chamber's Insurance Committee.'Illinois Blue Book 1975-1976,' Biographical Sketch of Bernard Epton =Chicago mayoral election of 1983= A resident of the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Epton ran against the liberal African American Democrat Harold Washington in the mayoral election in the spring of 1983.His Lonely Race for Mayor of Chicago, Bernard Epton Finds the G.O.P. on the Wrong Side of the Tracks - People Magazine (February 21, 1983) In a racially charged election, Epton came within 40,000 votes (of 1.2 million cast) of defeating the Democratic nominee. His total was the high-water mark for Chicago Republicans in elections for mayor in the heavily Democratic city. Epton received 81 percent of the votes of Chicago whites, and 3 percent from blacks. One of Epton's campaign slogans was \\"Epton for mayor... Before it's too late,\\" which critics declared had racial overtones. By his own account, Epton became uncomfortable with the racially-oriented nature of his campaign because he had been an active participant in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. He would have become the city's first Jewish mayor (an accomplishment that eventually was claimed by Rahm Emanuel when he was elected in 2011) and its first Republican mayor since William Hale Thompson left office in 1931. Later life and death After being defeated by Washington, Epton briefly returned to private life. He briefly sought the Republican nomination in the 1987 Chicago mayoral election. Four years after the 1983 mayoral election (and fewer than three weeks after Mayor Washington died suddenly of a heart attack) Epton himself suffered a coronary and died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the age of sixty-six on December 13, 1987. Epton was there visiting his son Jeffrey David \\"Jeff\\" Epton (born c. 1947), a socialist member of the Ann Arbor City Council and long-time critic of capital punishment.

On the night of 16/17 September 1897, in the Mamund Valley, North-West India, Corporal Smith, with other men, responded to a call for volunteers and followed two officers of the Royal Engineers (James Morris Colquhoun Colvin and Thomas Colclough Watson) into the burning village of Bilot, in an attempt to dislodge the enemy. Afterwards, although wounded, Corporal Smith continued fighting steadily and coolly, and also helped to carry the wounded to the place prepared for them. When one of the officers left in order to get help, the corporal held the position until his return, exposing himself to great danger and directing the fire of his men.

The team won 95 games, the National League pennant, and the 1934 World Series in seven games over the Detroit Tigers. Some baseball writers use the nickname to refer to a multi-year period. For example, Jack Cavanaugh has used the phrase, \\"the raucous Gas House era in the 1930s.\\" Overview \\"They don‚Äôt look like a major league ball club,\\" the New York Sun wrote about the team. \\"Their uniforms are stained and dirty and patched and ill fitting. . . They spit out of the sides of their mouths and then wipe the backs of their hands across their shirt fronts.\\" But, the Sun noted, \\"they are not afraid of anybody.\\" The nickname Gashouse Gang, by most accounts, came from the team's generally very shabby appearance and rough-and-tumble tactics. An opponent once stated the Cardinals players usually went into the field in unwashed, dirty, and smelly uniforms, which alone spread horror among their rivals. According to one account, shortstop Leo Durocher coined the term. He and his teammates were speaking derisively of the American League, and the consensus was that the Redbirds‚Äîshould they prevail in the National League race‚Äîwould handle whoever won the AL pennant. \\"Why, they wouldn't even let us in that league over there\\", Durocher, who had played for the New York Yankees, observed. \\"They think we're just a bunch of gashousers.\\" The phrase gas house referred to factories that turned coal into town gas for lighting and cooking. Common in U.S. cities until the widespread use of natural gas, the plants were noted for their foul smell and were typically located near railroad yards in the poorest neighborhood in the city. Another explanation holds that the name comes from Dizzy Dean, who played at City Park (renamed McKechnie Field in 1962), in Bradenton, Florida, for spring training in the 1930s. The story goes that Dean liked the city so much, he bought a local gas station and hung out there when he wasn't playing. The team was led by general manager Branch Rickey, playing manager Frankie Frisch and included other stars such as Joe Medwick and Ripper Collins. Many of the players on the Cardinals roster, including the Dean brothers, Bill DeLancey, Pepper Martin, Spud Davis, and Burgess Whitehead, were Southerners or Southwesterners from working-class backgrounds. The team featured five regulars who hit at least .300, a 30-game winner in Dizzy Dean (the last National League pitcher to win 30 games in a single season, and the last pitcher in Major League Baseball to do so until Denny McLain accomplished the feat for the Detroit Tigers), and four All- Stars, including player-manager Frisch. Not among the All-Stars was Collins, the first baseman who led the team in sixteen offensive categories with stats like a .333 batting average, a .615 slugging percentage, 35 home runs, and 128 runs batted in. In the World Series, the Cards and Tigers split the first two games in Detroit, and the Tigers took two of the next three in St. Louis. St. Louis proceeded to win the next two, including an 11‚Äì0 embarrassment of the Tigers in Detroit to win the Series. The stars for the Cards were Medwick, who had a .379 batting average with one of St. Louis's two home runs and a series- high five RBI, and the Dean Brothers, who combined for all four of the teams wins with 28 strikeouts and a 1.43 earned run average. In popular culture * Several Cardinal players participated in the informal \\"Mudcat Band.\\" Lon Warneke played guitar and sang, Pepper Martin played harmonica and guitar, Bill McGee played a fiddle, Bob Weiland blew into a jug, and outfielder Frenchy Bordagaray \\"played a contraption that included a washboard, a car horn, a whistle, and an electric light.\\" The band wore variants of the Cardinal uniform (with \\"Mudcats\\" replacing \\"Cardinals\\" on the birds-on-the-bat logo) and played gigs around the Midwest and South on off-days and during the off-season.The day the Cardinals played in Stamford: Excerpt from Season of '42, Stamford Advocate (Connecticut), Jack Cavanaugh, April 28, 2012. * in Goliath season 2 episode 3 \\"Yeah, well, I like to think that we're the Gashouse Gang, ‚Äì so fuck the Yankees.\\" *One of the teams in the 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon Baseball Bugs was the \\"Gashouse Gorillas\\". *Country-bluegrass band Old Crow Medicine Show refers to them in the song \\"Caroline\\" on their 2008 album Tennessee Pusher. *In the 1938 George Cukor remake of the 1930 Romantic comedy film Holiday, starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, Professor Potter (played by Edward Everett Horton) and his wife (played by Jean Dixon) enter a sophisticated and pompous New Year's Eve Party where they feel uncomfortably under dressed and out of place.

He is professor of economics at the University of Chicago. He received his B.A. in Economics at Universidad Nacional de La Plata in 1989 and his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1994. He was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 2008. He was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2018. Fernando Alvarez's most influential contribution seems to be his work with Urban Jermann (Wharton) on endogenously incomplete markets. They show how the limited commitment model of Timothy Kehoe and David Levine and also of Narayana Kocherlakota can be decentralized with certain borrowing constraints. They also showed how this model could explain some feature of asset prices, such as the equity premium. Several papers have used their model later on to explain other macroeconomic phenomena. Fernando Alvarez has also presented a new estimate of the welfare cost of business cycles, which is based on observed asset prices (with Urban Jermann). His other work includes models of monetary economies with segmented markets and search models with incomplete markets.

She was an independent member of the Victorian Legislative Council since April 2004, after resigning from the Labor Party, which she previously represented in the Council for Ballarat Province since 1999. She attempted to switch to the Victorian Legislative Assembly at the 2006 election, contesting the electorate of Ballarat East, but gained less than 7% of the vote. Hadden was born in Ivanhoe, Melbourne, and studied economics and law at Monash University. She worked for law firms in Melbourne and Ballarat, before founding her own practice in Ballarat in 1992. In the leadup to the 1999 state election, Hadden succeeded in securing Labor pre-selection for the Liberal- held seat of Ballarat Province. She was ultimately successful, defeating new Liberal candidate David Clark. Though she has never occupied a ministerial position, Hadden has been a member of the Law Reform Committee since her election to parliament, and in 2003, also joined the House Committee. Hadden has gained a reputation as something of a political maverick, having publicly attacked her own party on several issues. She came out strongly against controversial plans to build a toxic waste dump at Pittong, near Ballarat, and tabling a petition opposing the proposal in parliament. When Premier Steve Bracks continued to push for the dump to be sited at Pittong, despite significant negative publicity, she publicly slammed the government, labelling them \\"arrogant and dogmatic\\", and comparing them to former Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett - though this earned a stern rebuke from Bracks. The campaign was ultimately successful, but it cemented her falling out with the party, resulting in her resignation to become an independent in April 2004. She attempted unsuccessfully to switch to the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Ballarat East at the 2006 election, but came fourth, gaining 6.61% of the vote and allowing long-time rival Geoff Howard to win easily. Hadden has been a sharp critic of genetically modified crops and her government's policies on the issue, and has publicly pushed for a harder stance. She also attacked the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and was among ten Victorian Labor MPs who signed a petition declaring their opposition to the war. She is a member of a number of community organisations, including Amnesty International, the Fred Hollows Foundation and the National Trust of Australia.

Prospect Avenues, the neighborhood of Broadway. The neighborhood's ZIP code is 07104. Forest Hill is located on a ridge between the Passaic River and the valley of the Branch Brook. It was first developed by Elias Heller, who owned a file factory in North Newark, on the Belleville border. Heller Parkway is named in his honor. From the 1870s to the 1920s, generations of wealthy Newarkers built hundreds of stately homes in the area in various styles, including Beaux-Arts, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Gothic Revival, and Spanish Revival. Along with their mansions, the wealthy of Forest Hill also developed scores of social and literary clubs. Other than the homes, landmarks include the old Tiffany factory. The North End branch of the Newark Public Library serves the neighborhood. The neighborhood is well preserved and maintained, and few of the historic homes have been torn down, renovated into apartments, or transferred to institutional use. The northern part of the neighborhood is part of an official historic district. During special times throughout the year, there are special tours made possible by the New Jersey Historical Society where homeowners open their homes to visitors. The Sydenham House located on \\"The Old Road to Bloomfield\\" (east of Branch Brook Park) and built in 1712 is the city's oldest private residence. It was later expanded in the early 19th Century.

It thus contrasts with high fantasy stories, which take place in fictional worlds with their own sets of rules and physical laws. Intrusion fantasy places relatively less emphasis on typical elements associated with fantasy, setting a narrative in realistic environments with elements of the fantastical. Sometimes there are just enough fantastical elements to make ambiguous the boundary between what is real and what is purely psychological or supernatural. The word \\"low\\" refers to the level of prominence of traditional fantasy elements within the work, and is not any sort of remark on the work's quality. An alternative definition, common in role-playing games, rests on the story and characters being more realistic and less mythic in scope. This can mean that some works, for example Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian series, can be high fantasy according to the first definition but low fantasy according to the second, while with other works, such as the TV series Supernatural, the opposite is true. History Fantasy fiction developed out of fairy tales in the nineteenth century. Early nineteenth century scholarship in folklore led to fantasy fiction dominating Victorian children's literature. The genre diverged into the two subgenres, high and low fantasy, after the Edwardian era. Low fantasy itself diverged into further subgenres in the twentieth century. The forms of low fantasy include personified animals, personified toys (including The Indian in the Cupboard and The Doll's House; building on the earlier The Adventures of Pinocchio), comic fantasies of exaggerated character traits and altered physics (including Pippi Longstocking and The Borrowers), magical powers, supernatural elements and time slips. French fantastic fiction is predominantly within the low fantasy genre. Low fantasy corresponds to the French genre of \\"le fantastique\\" but French literature has no tradition equivalent to English literature's high fantasy. According to David Ketterer, emeritus professor of English at Concordia University, Montreal, the French term Le fantastique \\"refers to a specific kind of fantasy, that in which the supernatural or the bizarre intrudes into the everyday world; the closest equivalents in English would be 'low fantasy', 'dark fantasy' or 'weird fiction'. 'Le fantastique' does not cover the kind of complete secondary world creation typified by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. There is no tradition of \\"dragons and wizards\\" fantasy in French.\\" Where high fantasy does occur, the terms \\"le merveilleux\\" or \\"le fantastique moderne\\" are often used. Critical interpretations The fiction gives the author greater agency than allowed in the real world. Since being popularised in the works of E. Nesbit, the \\"low/portal variety\\" of fantasy has become a staple for its facility in challenging \\"established orders of society and thought.\\" Children usually read more low fantasy than high fantasy. The early 21st century is seeing an increase in prominence of the work of authors such as George R. R. Martin and Joe Abercrombie, whose high fantasy novels (works set entirely in fantasy worlds) have been referred to as \\"low fantasy\\" because they de-emphasize magic and non-human intelligent races in favor of a more cynical portrayal of human conflict. Fantasy writer David Chandler considered this \\"rise of 'Low Fantasy'\\" to reflect the contemporary reality of the War on Terror‚Äîcharacterized by \\"secret deals\\", \\"vicious reprisals\\" and \\"sudden acts of terrifying carnage\\"‚Äîmuch as the horror genre reacted to the Vietnam War a generation earlier. Distinguishing between subgenres High and low fantasy are distinguished as being set, respectively, in an alternative \\"secondary\\" world or in the real \\"primary\\" world. In many works, the distinction between primary or secondary world settings, and therefore whether it is low or high fantasy, can be unclear. The secondary world may take three forms, described by Nikki Gamble in her explication of three characteristics of high fantasy: # Primary does not exist (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons) or is irrelevant (e.g., Discworld) # Entered through a portal from the primary world (e.g., Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, The Chronicles of Narnia, His Dark Materials, and The Dark Tower) # World-within-a-world (e.g., American Gods, The Gods of PegƒÅna, The Magicians, and Harry Potter) A few high fantasy series do not easily fit into Gamble's categories. For example, J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is set in the primary world of Earth in the ancient past,Return of the King, Appendix D, Calendars: '...long ago as those times are now reckoned in years and lives of men, they were not very remote according to the memory of the Earth.'Letters 151, 165, 183, 211, Letters 325, 17 July 1971, Letters 328 Autumn 1971 and he adamantly disagreed with anyone who thought otherwise.Letters 211, \\"...steed of the Witch-King...its description even provides a sort of way in which it could be a last survivor of older geological eras.\\", \\"...it would be difficult to fit the lands and events (or 'cultures') into such evidence as we possess, archaeological or geological, concerning the nearer or remoter part of what is now Europe; though the Shire, for instance, is expressly stated to have been in this region (I p. 12).\\", \\"Arda 'realm' was the name given to our world or earth......I hope the, evidently long but undefined gap* in time between the Fall of Barad-dur and our Days is sufficient for 'literary credibility', even for readers acquainted with what is known as 'pre-history'.

Hogwarts is therefore as much of an alternative world as C. S. Lewis' Narnia, which means that both series are in the high fantasy subgenre. Similarly, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials is largely set in an alternate Oxfordshire, a real location, but the fact that it is an alternate world at all places it in the high fantasy subgenre. Some sources place Harry Potter and His Dark Materials in the low fantasy genre. Karin E. Westman, writing in The Oxford Handbook of Children's Literature states that because \\"[J. K.] Rowling is much more interested in how fantasy provides perspective on everyday experience and the individual's place in society,\\" and her inclusion of bildungsroman (a coming-of-age story) and the school story genres, \\"align her primarily with the domestic (or low) fantasy of authors such as E. Nesbit, Elizabeth Goudge, and Paul Gallico...as well as authors like Philip Pullman and Jonathan Stroud, who are also interested in the intersection of the personal and the political within quotidian experiences.\\" Low fantasy is related to a number of other genres or subgenres. * Urban fantasy takes place in a modern urban as opposed to rural or historical setting, and thus can be viewed as a type of low fantasy. * Dark fantasy uses fantasy to create a sense of horror or dread. Since it often has a real-world setting, there is an overlap with low fantasy. * Paranormal romance, of which the best-known variety is the vampire romance, is nearly always low fantasy. * Superhero fiction may count as low fantasy if the hero's powers have a supernatural rather than a scientific (or pseudoscientific) explanation. * Magical realism has a largely realistic view of the world but introduces supernatural elements. While authors such as Gene Wolfe and Terry Pratchett regard it as fantasy, it has been claimed as a different genre on the grounds that in magical realism the supernatural events are usually included in the worldview of the human characters while in low fantasy they usually violate it.Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice, Magical realism and the fantastic: Resolved versus unresolved antinomy.

It is also called kabocha squash or Japanese pumpkin in North America. In Japan, \\"kabocha\\" may refer to either this squash, to the Western pumpkin, or indeed to other squashes. Many of the kabocha in the market are kuri kabocha, a type created from seiyo kabocha (buttercup squash). Varieties of kabocha include Ajihei, Ajihei No. 107, Ajihei No. 331, Ajihei No. 335, Cutie, Ebisu, Emiguri, Marron d'Or and Miyako. Description Kabocha is hard on the outside with knobbly- looking skin. It is shaped like a squat pumpkin and has a dull-finished, deep- green skin with some celadon-to-white stripes and an intense yellow-orange color on the inside. In many respects it is similar to buttercup squash, but without the characteristic protruding \\"cup\\" on the blossom (bottom) end. An average kabocha weighs two to three pounds, but a large squash can weigh as much as eight pounds.Food Dictionary at Epicurious.com: kabocha squash  Culinary use  Kabocha has an exceptional sweet flavor, even sweeter than butternut squash. It is similar in texture and flavor to a pumpkin and sweet potato combined. Some kabocha can taste like Russet potatoes or chestnuts. The rind is edible although some cooks may peel it to speed up the cooking process or to suit their personal taste preferences. Kabocha is commonly utilized in side dishes and soups, or as a substitute for potato or other squash varieties. It can be roasted after cutting the squash in half, scooping out the seeds, and then cutting the squash into wedges. With a little olive oil and seasoning, it can be baked in the oven. Likewise, cut Kabocha halves can be added to a pressure cooker and steamed under high pressure for 15‚Äì20 minutes. Kabocha is available all year but is best in late summer and early fall. Kabocha is primarily grown in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, California, Florida, Hawaii, Southwestern Colorado, Mexico, Tasmania, Tonga, New Zealand, Chile, Jamaica, and South Africa, but is widely adapted for climates that provide a growing season of 100 days or more. Most of the kabocha grown in California, Colorado, Tonga and New Zealand is actually exported to Japan. = Japan = In Japan, kabocha is a common ingredient in vegetable tempura and is also made into soup.

Nutrition This squash is rich in beta carotene, with iron, vitamin C, potassium, and smaller traces of calcium, folic acid, and minute amounts of B vitamins.Kabocha, By Setsuko Yoshizuka, About.com, Wayback Machine Ripeness When kabocha is just harvested, it is still growing. Therefore, unlike other vegetables and fruits, freshness is not as important. It should be fully matured first, in order to become flavorful, by first ripening the kabocha in a warm place (77 ¬∞F/25 ¬∞C) for 13 days to convert some of the starch to sugar. Then the kabocha is transferred to a cool place (50 ¬∞F/10 ¬∞C) and stored for about a month in order to increase carbohydrate content. In this way the just-harvested, dry, bland-tasting kabocha is transformed into a smooth, sweet kabocha. Fully ripened, succulent kabocha will have reddish- yellow flesh, a hard skin, and a dry, corky stem. It reaches the peak of ripeness about 1.5‚Äì3 months after it is harvested.\\"Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) A Flavor of the Earth\\" Gochiso Web Magazine, 2006, p. 8 History All squashes were domesticated in Mesoamerica. In 1997, new evidence suggested that domestication occurred 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, a few thousand years earlier than previous estimates. That would be 4,000 years earlier than the domestication of maize and beans, the other major food plant groups in Mesoamerica. Archeological and genetic plant research in the 21st century suggests that the peoples of eastern North America independently domesticated squash, sunflower, marsh elder, and chenopod. Portuguese sailors introduced kabocha to Japan in 1541, bringing it with them from Cambodia. The Portuguese name for the squash, Camboja ab√≥bora („Ç´„É≥„Éú„Ç∏„É£„Éª„Ç¢„Éú„Éú„É©), was shortened by the Japanese to kabocha. Kabocha is written in Kanji as ÂçóÁìú (literally, \\"southern melon\\"), and it is also occasionally referred to as Âçó‰∫¨Áìú (Nanking melon). In China, this term is applied to many types of squashes with harder skin and beefier flesh (including pumpkins), not just kabochas.

Eerdmans, 3rd edition (1994) mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. The prophet Elijah hid himself on the banks of the Cherith and was fed by ravens during the early part of the three years' drought which he announced to King Ahab (). Etymology and toponymy Cherith is a common English spelling of the Hebrew name ◊õ÷∞÷º◊®÷¥◊ô◊™ \\"K…ôrƒ´·πØ\\", that comes from the Hebrew root ◊õ◊®◊™ (kh*r*t) meaning to cut off or cut down.

Chorath is the name used in the 3rd-century BCE Greek translation of the Torah or Pentateuch, known as the Septuagint. Cherith is referred to as a nahal in Hebrew (◊†◊ó◊ú, ), a seasonal stream often described in a MENA context as a wadi, from the Arabic term ŸàÿßÿØŸä ('). Identification =Wadi al-Yabis= It is usually identified with Wadi al-Yabis, a stream in western Jordan, which flows into the Jordan River at a spot opposite of Beit She'an and slightly south of it. Travellers have described it as one of the wildest ravines of the Fertile Crescent, and peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. During the summer, the stream is very dry. Olive trees grow on its banks, and it is home to an array of wildlife including gazelle, hyrax, and egret. According to the 1994 Peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, Israel can maintain its use of the Jordan River waters between the Yarmouk and Wadi al-Yabis.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty Annex II, Article 2.3, accessed 30 October 2017 =Wadi Kelt= Alternatively, the stream Cherith has been identified by some with Wadi Kelt at St. George's Monastery. If 1 Kings 17:3 is to be translated \\"Wadi Cherith, which is east of the Jordan\\", this identification would be in contradiction to the Bible, since Wadi Qelt is west of it. The King James version states Elijah should \\"turn eastward\\" (from Samaria); therefore the brook could be anywhere east of Samaria (Now Sebastia, West Bank), on either side of the River Jordan.King James Bible; 1 Kings 17:3 Some translations (i.e. the Orthodox Jewish Bible: ) allow such an interpretation, by stating that Cherith is merely \\"near the Yarden\\" (Yarden being the Hebrew name of the River Jordan). =Wadi at Phasaelis= Marino Sanuto the Elder commented in 1321 that the stream extended into Phasaelis, which was named after Prince Phasael, the brother of King Herod. This identification would again contradict the more common translation of 1 Kings 17:3 (see above: Wadi Kelt), since Phasaelis has been identified at a spot west, not east of the Jordan.

Often called the ‚Äúfloating White House‚Äù, the Sequoia offered presidents, first families and high-ranking government officials a place to escape the complexities of official life while also serving as the backdrop for significant moments of 20th-century American history. A Congressional Resolution passed December 1985 stated, ‚ÄúSequoia was the setting for Presidential meetings, negotiations and decisions of extraordinary significance for and effect on the history of the United States and the course of world events‚Äù and ‚Äúrecognized the unique significance of the former Presidential yacht Sequoia which has made her a symbol of American political heritage and the Office of the President‚Äù. Sequoia was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1987 and according to a statement made by the President of The Mystic Seaport Museum to the New York Times, \\"The Sequoia is probably the most significant artifact of presidential importance that is in private hands\\". Formally decommissioned on December 9, 1935, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Sequoia continues to carry its ‚ÄúUSS‚Äù designation. The Sequoia is believed to have been named by her original owner, Emily Roebling Cadwalader, after Sequoyah, a leader of the Cherokee Nation. Design and construction Designed by John Trumpy and built by the famed John H. Mathis & Company Shipbuilders in Camden, New Jersey, Sequoia was completed at a cost of approximately $200,000 and launched October 27, 1925.‚ÄúNew $200,000 Yacht Built Here.‚Äù Camden Post-Telegram, October 27, 1925. Originally named the Sequoia II, she was the second of four successively larger yachts built between 1924 and 1931 for Mr. and Mrs. Richard McCall Cadwalader of Philadelphia. The Cadwalader's third and fourth yachts were named Savarona and Savarona II, respectively. At 104 feet in length, Sequoia IIs hull was originally constructed of long-leaf yellow pine on white oak frames and her deckhouse of mahogany and teak. She is capable of comfortably sleeping eight guests in her three double and two single staterooms, has ample crew quarters and can seat 22 for formal dinners.One Folder Collection Series of the Herbert Hoover Presidential LibraryBox 49, folder ‚ÄúSO 6: Receptions‚Äù of the Kenneth A.

Sequoia Presidential Yacht. Centreville, MD: Tidewater Publishers, 2004. Emily Roebling Cadwalader became the driving force behind the four exceptional yachts constructed for the Cadwaladers, culminating in 1931 with the 446-foot Savarona II. = Sequoia IIs christening and early use = Local newspapers recount that on October 26, 1925 after arriving with her party in two Rolls-Royce automobiles, Mrs. Cadwalader broke a bottle of champagne against the bow of the Sequoia II commemorating its service to her family. Oddly, these accounts of Sequoia IIs christening make no mention of prohibition when discussing the champagne. The Cadwaladers sailed Sequoia II on various high-profile trips to the coasts of Florida during 1925 and 1926, including to West Palm Beach and Miami.‚ÄúParty of Northerners Arrives Aboard Yacht.‚Äù The Palm Beach Post, February 8, 1927.‚ÄúIn Miami Beach Social By-Ways.‚Äù The Miami News, January 28, 1926. Three years after being built for the Cadwaladers, Sequoia II was sold to William Dunning, a Houston-based oil executive who used the vessel for various gambling trips to Cuba and business- related travel along the Mexican coastline. Dunning was forced to sell Sequoia II during the Great Depression. U.S. Government service On March 24, 1931, the U.S. Bureau of Navigation within the Department of Commerce purchased Sequoia II from Dunning for approximately $40,000. Sequoia II initially was used to patrol the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays as a decoy vessel to attract would-be bootleggers. In hope of selling illegal liquor, bootleggers would come alongside what was seen as a wealthy family's yacht only to be arrested. = Presidential service = President Herbert Hoover disembarking from the USS Sequoia August 8, 1932  Hoover Administration  Herbert Hoover was known to have an affection for Mathis-Trumpy houseboats, such as Sequoia, and had spent time both between his election victory and inauguration and during the early part of his administration cruising and fishing in Florida aboard the yacht Saunterer, a 98-foot Mathis-Trumpy house boat owned by his friend, Jeremiah Milbank. Having decommissioned the former presidential yacht The Mayflower in 1929, Herbert Hoover initiated Sequoia IIs presidential service by using her on various occasions during the final years of his Administration. This included four documented voyages from 1931 to 1933 for official presidential business as well as for pleasure cruises.Box 389 ‚ÄúPresidential Subject Files‚Äù, folder ‚ÄúUSS Sequoia‚Äù of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Various news outlets reported on the status of Hoover's fishing trips aboard Sequoia.‚ÄúGiant Fish Falls Prey to Hoover.‚Äù Los Angeles Times, January 1, 1933.

Hoover used a photo of the indulgent yacht on his 1932 White House Christmas Card, when many Americans were suffering through the Depression and struggling for basic necessities.  Roosevelt Administration  President Franklin D. Roosevelt departs U.S. Naval Academy aboard Sequoia (1935)President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the yacht more frequently, with over fifty recorded outings between 1933 and 1935. On March 25, 1933, what was now known simply as Sequoia and no longer Sequoia II, became the official presidential yacht after it was transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Naval Department. An elevator was installed to enable access for the polio-stricken President, who, like Hoover before him, enjoyed fishing aboard Sequoia and also used the vessel for important meetings and summits. On April 23, 1933, President Roosevelt hosted British Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald as his first guest on the Sequoia. During a cruise to Mount Vernon they discussed the Great Depression, demilitarization, Adolf Hitler's rise and strategies for averting the threat of a potential new war with Germany. As it became clear these efforts were failing and war approached, the wooden Sequoia was deemed unsafe for the President, and on December 9, 1935, Sequoia was officially reassigned to the Secretary of the Navy and the steel-hulled was designated as the presidential yacht.Kelly, Giles M. Sequoia Presidential Yacht. Centreville, MD: Tidewater Publishers, 2004 For the next three decades, Sequoia served at the pleasure of the United States Secretary of Navy until its recommissioning in 1969 as a presidential yacht.  Truman Administration  President Harry Truman and prime ministers Clement Attlee and Mackenzie King board the Sequoia for discussions about nuclear weapons, November 1945While serving as the yacht for the Secretary of the Navy, U.S. presidents and members of the Cabinet continued to use the Sequoia, often providing the backdrop for critical moments in American history. President Harry S. Truman who used the as his official yacht, nevertheless called upon Sequoia to host the first atomic arms control talks. Just three months after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it was aboard the Sequoia during a November 1945 cruise down the Potomac past Mount Vernon that Truman first discussed the promise of atomic power and the need to control atomic weapons with the United States' closest allied leaders, Prime Ministers Clement Attlee of Great Britain and Mackenzie King of Canada. On September 16, 1946, then General Dwight David Eisenhower's calendar shows he met aboard the Sequoia with U.S. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, General Carl Spaatz, and British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery. This meeting, under the guise of a cruise to Mount Vernon, initiated a series of highly classified political and military discussions from which emerged the Western European Union, which formed in 1948, followed by NATO a year later. General Eisenhower later served from 1951 to 1952 as the first Supreme Commander of NATO.  Eisenhower Administration  On election to the presidency, Eisenhower ordered his Joint Chiefs of Staff (including Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs) to meet on the Sequoia to further formulate and develop a plan for implementing Eisenhower's ‚ÄúNew Look‚Äù defensive policy. On August 6, 1953, Admiral Radford and his fellow Chiefs set sail in the Chesapeake Bay aboard the Sequoia. The military leaders understood the President wanted a consensus and it was not until late on August 8, once the Chiefs had all signed what would be known as the \\"Sequoia Report\\", that the Sequoia returned to Washington. The Sequoia Report helped introduce a defensive strategy to reduce the overall size and cost of the military and rely heavily on nuclear deterrence, a doctrine that would serve as a defining turning point in U.S. strategy during the Cold War.  Kennedy Administration  Secretary of the Navy John Connally welcoming President Kennedy Aboard Sequoia July 11, 1961President Kennedy's use of Sequoia is not as well documented as that of other presidents. Government photographers did not accompany him on the yacht, and curiously, immediately after his assassination, an order was given to destroy all personal logs associated with Sequoias use during Kennedy's Administration. At the time, Paul ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Fay, one of Kennedy's closest friends and confidants, served as Acting Secretary of the Navy. John F. Kennedy opening gifts with family and friends on board USS Sequoia May 29, 1963 During October 1962, President Kennedy held strategy meetings on Sequoia to discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis. On May 29, 1963, the Kennedys hosted a cruise to celebrate the President's 46th and final birthday. At 8 pm, the couple boarded Sequoia to the music of two orchestras. With 25 friends and family, the President and his guests danced after a meal of roast filet and Dom Perignon.Papers of John F. Kennedy. Presidential Papers. White House Staff Files of Sanford L. Fox. Social Events, 1961-1964.

Mary Pinchot Meyer's presence at the intimate celebration and her murder the following year have been topics of much speculation. At the time President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963 he and the First Lady were scheduled to host friends for a Sunday cruise aboard Sequoia, two days later, on November 24, 1963. In April 1964, the widowed Mrs. Kennedy spent an evening aboard Sequoia with a group of President Kennedy's closest friends. Frank Gannon, the piano player aboard that day, recounts a poignantly sad story of Mrs. Kennedy requesting him to play ‚ÄúMe and My Shadow‚Äù a song about being alone. On May 27, 1964, two days before what would have been Kennedy's 47th birthday, his closest family and some friends once again gathered aboard Sequoia for a dinner cruise documented by Kennedy speechwriter and presidential historian, Arthur Schlesinger Jr.  Johnson Administration  President Johnson has dinner with guest aboard the Sequoia as Secret Service Agent Rufus Youngblood stands in the background, July 15, 1965 In an interview after her husband had left office, former first Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, remembered the Johnson's ‚Äúlove affair with the Sequoia goes back indeed to 1949.‚ÄùTranscript, Claudia \\"Lady Bird\\" Johnson Oral History Interview XXV, 1/2-3/82, by Michael L.

Having become friends with then Secretary of the Navy and soon to be Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, the future president and First Lady had been invited guests aboard the ship on numerous occasions during the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations.Transcript, Claudia \\"Lady Bird\\" Johnson Oral History Interview XXI, 8/10-11/81, by Michael L. Gillette, Internet Copy, LBJ Library. As Kennedy's vice president, Johnson made eight recorded trips aboard Sequoia. As president, Johnson's use of Sequoia would increase, with more than 35 recorded trips during his 5 years in office. During 1964, President Johnson ordered FDR's elevator removed and a bar installed in its place. Johnson used Sequoia to lobby members of congress on critical legislative matters including civil rights and to strategize with his advisors regarding important decisions including escalation of the Vietnam war. Sequoia was used for hosting foreign ambassadors, as well as the leaders of Turkey and Greece who discussed the ongoing issue of Cyprus.Folder, \\"Greece, Papandreau Visit - 6/2324/64 [2 of 2],\\" Country Files, NSF, Box 127 [2 of 2], LBJ Presidential Library, accessed July 15, 2019, https://www.discoverlbj.org/item/nsf-cf-b127-2-f2 President Johnson frequently used Sequoia as a place to unwind and watch a film.  Nixon Administration  President Nixon and Secretary Brezhnev on board the Sequoia June 19, 1973Sequoias most frequent presidential passenger was Johnson's successor, Richard Nixon. President Nixon recorded more than 80 trips aboard the yacht while in office. On June 19, 1973, when a party of U.S. and Soviet diplomats accompanied the President and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev on a working dinner aboard the yacht. Throughout their cruise, the leaders discussed an agreement between the U.S. and U.S.S.R regarding the prevention of nuclear war, which was signed by President Nixon and General Secretary Brezhnev two days later on June 22, 1973 during the Washington Summit. It was aboard the Sequoia that President Nixon decided to resign and informed his family. In a 1983 interview conducted by Frank Gannon of the Nixon Foundation titled, \\"The Smoking Gun and the Sequoia\\" former president Nixon describes the August 5, 1974 cruise aboard the Sequoia during which he learned a Court had ordered him to release - the transcript of a tape recording that showed he approved the cover-up of the Watergate break-in.  Ford Administration  President Gerald Ford holds a Cabinet meeting Aboard the Sequoia May 1975 Following President Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, Gerald Ford assumed the presidency. Ford used Sequoia less than Nixon. In May 1975, Ford was the first known president to host a Cabinet meeting aboard the vessel. Lasting four hours, the President and his cabinet discussed wide-ranging issues facing the United States, including a discussion regarding Congressional relations, confronting the issue of Vietnamese refugees, and the status of the U.S. Energy program in light of the 1973 oil crisis.Box C20, folder ‚ÄúPresidential Handwriting, 5/5/1975 (3)‚Äù of the Presidential Handwriting File at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library Later that summer, Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, wife of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, entertained Mrs. Takeo Miki (wife of the Prime Minister of Japan) on a cruise along the Potomac during a state visit.Box 32, folder ‚ÄúState Dinners - 8/5/75 - Japan‚Äù of the Sheila Weidenfeld Files at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library. Similarly, in October, 1975, the yacht would cruise along the Potomac to entertain Emperor Hirohito and the accompanying delegation from Japan. Another notable visitor aboard the Sequoia during the Ford years was the prime minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau, who in 1976, had a working dinner with the President aboard Sequoia.Box 17, folder ‚ÄúCanada (Aboard the Sequoia)‚Äù of the Maria Downs Files at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library. President Ford celebrated his 62nd birthday on the Sequoia shortly after a surprise party given by White House staff. In 1975, Susan Ford hosted a pre-prom party aboard the yacht with a group of friends, and then celebrated her 19th birthday aboard Sequoia the following year. First Lady Betty Ford hosted a June 9, 1976 Sequoia cruise in celebration of Happy Rockefeller's 50th birthday.  Carter Administration  After 46 years of government service, citing cost concerns -- the Sequoia cost taxpayers an estimated $800,000 annually -- President Carter ordered the Sequoia be sold at auction. Carter would later recall selling the yacht as a mistake. In a conversation with broadcaster Ray Suarez, Carter said: ‚ÄúPeople thought I was not being reverent enough to the office I was holding, that I was too much of a peanut farmer, not enough of an aristocrat, or something like that. So I think that shows that the American people want something of, an element of, image of monarchy in the White House.‚Äù In his 2015 autobiography \\"A Full Life: Reflections at 90\\" Presidential Carter wrote of selling Sequoia, \\"I was determined to be strict on expenditures for the nation, and to set an example in my personal life. I decided to sell the presidential yacht Sequoia, and to minimize the playing of ‚ÄúRuffles and Flourishes‚Äù when I arrived at public meetings. I was surprised when some of these changes proved to be quite unpopular, and to learn how much the public cherished the pomp and ceremony of the presidency.\\" = Winston Churchill and the Sequoia = Sequoia served as refuge for presidents to relax with friends and conduct business outside of the public spotlight. As a result, no official documentary evidence exists for many events which took place aboard the yacht, and certain lore has developed, particularly regarding British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's activities aboard Sequoia. This includes, but is not limited to, Churchill and Roosevelt planning D-day together on the large table in Sequoias main salon, Churchill gifting deck chairs from the Queen Mary for Sequoias upper deck and Churchill being the impetus behind Roosevelt decommissioning the USS Sequoia so that the two leaders could drink on board ‚Äì alcoholic beverages were prohibited aboard commissioned naval vessels. Despite these persistent legends, Churchill was never documented as being aboard the yacht. Private ownership Sequoia has had 7 owners since being sold by the U.S. government in 1977. Certain of the past owners sought to offset the costs of maintaining and operating the vessel by offering Sequoia for private charter, and others were non-profit groups seeking to maintain her for historical reasons and/or return her to presidential service. Thomas Malloy purchased Sequoia from the U.S government in May 1977 for $286,000.Box 57, folder ‚ÄúSequoia ‚Äì Presidential Yacht‚Äù of the Elizabeth Lumpkin Press Office Files at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. Three months later, Malloy resold Sequoia to a partnership led by Norman Pulliam for $355,000. Mr. Pulliam maintained Sequoia in Myrtle Beach SC and then sold her to The Ocean Learning Institute of Palm Beach, FL during March 1980 for $750,000. The institute used Sequoia to entertain potential donors. Vice President George Bush and future Chinese President Shangkun Yang aboard Sequoia May 1987Sequoia off of Manhattan July 4, 1986The Presidential Yacht Trust, a non-profit organization, acquired Sequoia from the Institute for approximately $1.1 million in 1980 and brought Sequoia back to D.C for use by the President and his cabinet. President and Mrs. Reagan let it be known There is some feeling in the White House that [the President] should not be on a million-dollar yacht when he has to cut programs such as food stamps and such. Although, Reagan preferred to appear on horseback, he authorized his Cabinet's use of Sequoia. During an August 1982 luncheon aboard Sequoia, E.P.A. administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford (mother of future Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch) announced to eight Reagan Administration officials, she was holding back Federal funds to clean up a toxic waste site near Los Angeles to avoid helping the Senate campaign of former California Gov. Brown, a Democrat. When Congress charged the EPA had mishandled such toxic waste Superfund sites and demanded records, Gorsuch refused and became the first agency director in U.S. history to be cited for contempt of Congress. During 1984 Sequoia received a heroes welcome as she was taken on an eight-month, 6,000-mile tour of the country. A Congressional Resolution written to assist the Trust in bringing Sequoia back into government service, passed in December 1985. Sequoia underwent a $2 million restoration in 1986 before participating in the flotilla of vessels celebrating the centennial of the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 1986. Vice President George H.W. Bush used Sequoia in May 1987 to host a day of meetings with Yang Shangkun who subsequently served as President of the People's Republic of China from 1988 to 1993. Sequoia was designated as a National Historic Landmark in March 1988. Political considerations dictated that if the Sequoia were to be returned to the government for use by the President, the cost should not be born by the U.S. government. The Trust was surprised by the Navy's requirement that the Trust not only pay for the yacht and its operations but also the security which would be required by the President. Unable to pay a $2 million repair bill, title to the yacht was transferred to the Virginia shipyard and Sequoia spent 6 years in storage. Upon taking office, the Clinton White House worked closely with the Trust during 1993 and 1994 to have Kuwait purchase Sequoia from the Virginia yard where she was being stored and transfer title to the Trust as gift to the American people and a gesture of gratitude to the US for leading a coalition of 34 counties in liberating Kuwait after Saddam Hussein's 1990 Iraqi invasion. President Clinton aboard Sequoia October 17, 2000 A Japanese buyer was about to purchase Sequoia and move her to Tokyo, when The Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group LLC purchased Sequoia from the Virginia shipyard in September 2000 for approximately $2.0 million and made her available in Washington, D.C. for private charters until 2014. President Clinton attended one such event aboard Sequoia on October 17, 2000‚Äîmaking him the 10th person who served as U.S. president to walk upon Sequoia's decks‚Äîthe full list includes: Herbert C. Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, George H. W. Bush (while Vice President) and William J. Clinton. During 2005, The Mystic Seaport Museum (located in Mystic, Connecticut) entered into an exclusive 6-month option agreement to purchase Sequoia from the Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group but was unable to raise the $20 million needed to buy, restore and maintain the vessel. Upon the expiration of its option, the museum's president told the New York Times, \\"[He] was disappointed because the Sequoia, a national historic landmark, is probably the most desirable vessel in private hands.\\" Sequoia is currently owned by FE Partners, a portfolio company of the Washington D.C. based Equator Capital Group which purchased Sequoia in October 2016 for $7.8 million. Equator Capital is controlled by L. Michael Cantor and is in the process of restoring the Sequoia at a repair yard in Belfast Maine. When asked about future plans by MegaYacht News, Cantor stated, ‚ÄúOnce restored, our intention is to bring Sequoia back to Washington where she will serve as a venue to teach American presidential history and promote ocean conservation causes‚Äù FE Partners purchased Sequoia after a protracted litigation with The Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group, the former owner who believed Sequoia to be worth significantly more than the $7.8 million purchase price and filed a January 2013 lawsuit against FE Partners to block the sale. As part of a loan agreement, the former owner had provided FE Partners with an option to purchase Sequoia for $13 million or in the event of a default under the loan agreement for $7.8 million. On August 29, 2013, a Delaware Court entered a Default Judgment against the former owner and confirmed FE Partner's contractual right to purchase Sequoia for $7.8 million. On November 14, 2017, the same Delaware Court found the aggregate amount of funds which had been loaned by FE Partners to the former owner, legal fees, Sequoia‚Äôs 3rd part debts and the cost to repair Sequoia exceeded the $7.8 million purchase price. As a consequence, the Court also ruled FE Partners was not required to pay any additional funds to the former owner. Upon purchasing Sequoia in October 2016, FE Partners filed a lawsuit against Chesapeake Boat Works of Deltaville, Virginia which had damaged Sequoia while hauling her out of the water on a marine railway during December 2014. FE Partners won a $700,000 settlement award against the Virginia shipyard on February 22, 2019, and then began the process of removing Sequoia from the railway, placing her on a barge and transporting the barge from Virginia to Maine. In September 2019, the Sequoia was first moved by barge from Deltaville, Virginia, to Cambridge, Maryland. and then during October, from Cambridge, Maryland to Belfast, Maine where Sequoia arrived on October 22, 2019 to begin its restoration by French & Webb Inc for an undisclosed price. Restoration According to MegaYacht News, the Sequoia restoration will require 9 to 10 months of careful planning before the refurbishment itself can start. French and his team are sourcing woods to supplement and/or replace her long-leaf yellow pine, mahogany, and teak.

COFOE has filed amicus briefs in several court cases relating to ballot access. In the late 1990s a national ballot access organization with a focus similar to that of COFOE held several meetings in the Washington, DC area, attended by members of the Reform Party, Libertarian Party, Green Party, Natural Law Party, Socialist Party USA, and various independents and others. This new national ballot access coalition discussed the possibility of formally constituting a tax-exempt civic organization for purposes of ballot access litigation and education; at one point some participants in this group considered borrowing the COFOE name.

Early life Rafael Eitan was born in Afula, a city in the North District of Israel, in 1929. His father, Eliyahu Eitan, was one of the founders of the Jewish defense organization Hashomer. Rafael was raised in the community of Tel Adashim. Zvi Nishri (Orloff), a pioneer in modern physical education in Israel, was his uncle. In contrary to rumors that he was descended from a Subbotnik family, Raful was actually Jewish from both sides, a genealogical inquiry found.Nahum Barnea, Five After One, Yedioth Ahronoth, 10 June 2011, page 3 (Hebrew) His father gave Rafael and his brothers and sisters a strict education. Rafael later married Miriam, with whom he had five children. They ultimately divorced and he married Ofra Meirson. Military career =Early battles= Eitan as commander company A, 4th Battalion of the Harel Brigade in 1948 Eitan was a junior officer in the Palmach, the Haganah's elite strike force, and took part in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. He fought in Jerusalem and received a head wound in the battle for the San Simon Monastery in April 1948. Later he served with the 10th Infantry Battalion in the Lachish-Negev region.

Dani Matt, Lt. Moshe Efron, Maj. Gen Asaf Simchoni; On ground, l to r: Capt. Aharon Davidi, Lt. Ya'akov Ya'akov, Capt. 'Raful' Eitan. In 1954, Captain Eitan became commander of a Paratroops company in Unit 101. During Operation Kinereth in 1955 he received a machine gun wound to his chest, while participating in a military raid into Syria. For this action he was decorated with the Medal of Courage. In the 1956 Suez Crisis, Major Eitan was the commander of the 890 Paratroopers battalion and participated in the 29 October parachute attack on the Mitla Pass. During the Six-Day War in early June 1967, as a Colonel he commanded the Paratroopers Brigade on the Gaza front. He received a severe head wound in combat while approaching the Suez Canal. In the evening of 28 December 1968, he commanded the Commando raid on Beirut airport. In 1969 he was appointed head of infantry forces and later served as a division commander. As a division commander, of 36th Ugda, Brigadier General Eitan stopped the Syrian attack into the Golan Heights during the October 1973 Yom Kippur War. After the war, he was appointed to commander of the northern command and promoted to the rank of Major General. = Chief of Staff = On 1 April 1978, Eitan was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and was appointed by Ezer Weizman to be the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces. Eitan opened his term with symbolic steps to increase discipline and efficiency in the IDF. He required soldiers to wear the military beret and to collect spent cartridges after rifle range practice. Eitan oversaw the redeployment of the IDF outside of the Sinai Peninsula after the peninsula was handed back to Egypt. He and Sharon demolished the Israeli settlement Yamit in Sinai in April 1982 after the Egyptians refused to pay for its infrastructure. As Chief of Staff, Eitan initiated a project that was known as \\"Raful Youth\\" (Na'arei Raful), in which young persons from low socio-economic background were integrated into the IDF and were trained for professions that allowed them to come out of poverty and avoid getting involved in crime. The IDF also helped those youth to complete their high school studies. He was Chief of Staff at the time of the Israeli air attack on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor complex on 7 June 1981. In April 1982 he initiated a new policy in the Occupied Territories which in Israeli army slang became known by the Hebrew word tertur. One document from his office stated: After the trial of seven members of the Israeli army in December 1982, an Israeli operations officer was quoted as described tertur: \\"In addition to this business where you work to discover the provocateurs, you tertur the population. Population tertur does not mean that you punish those who did something, but you simply round up everyone, just like that.\\"Torture and intimidation in the West Bank ‚Äì the case of AL-FARA'A prison INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF JURISTS and LAW IN THE SERVICE OF MAN, 1985. page 3. Quotation from Captain Artzi Mordechai. Newsweek 14 February 1983 = Lebanon War = Eitan (center) with two officers, Amnon Eshkol and Mordechai Yerushalmi, in Lebanon, 1983 On 3 June 1982, Abu Nidal's militant group gravely wounded Israel's ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov, in an assassination attempt. In response, the Israeli Air Force bombed Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. The Palestinian militants shelled Israel's northern settlements in retaliation and resulted in the Israeli government's 4 June order to begin the 1982 Lebanon War. The operation was launched on 6 June and soon became a full-scale invasion. The Israeli plan was to drive the PLO away from the Israeli border and help Bachir Gemayel's Phalangist militia take control of south Lebanon. During the war, the IDF faced the Syrian military, Palestinian militants and various militias, such as Hezbollah. The IDF engaged in urban warfare and shelled Beirut to hit PLO headquarters. The IDF achieved some impressive military results ‚Äì such as wiping out the entire Syrian air defense system in the first days of the war, under the command of IAF Major general David Ivri. But it also had some failures, such as the Battle of Sultan Yacoub. The operation was designed to be limited ‚Äì both in time and area ‚Äì but the IDF advanced far beyond the planned \\"40 kilometers\\" under the command of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon. The mounting Israeli casualties in Lebanon, combined with the Sabra and Shatila massacre, resulted in mass protests by the Israeli public against the war ‚Äì which resulted in a cease-fire agreements and the establishment of the Kahan Commission to investigate the massacre. Kahan Commission In concluding that Eitan was \\"in breach of duty that was incumbent on the Chief of Staff\\"Final Report, (Authorized Translation). Page 77 the Commission focused on two points: Firstly, that he did not take into consideration the \\"danger of acts of vengeance and bloodshed\\" when he, with the Minister of Defence, decided to send the Phalangist militia into the refugee camps. The commission argued that it was \\"common knowledge ... that there was a possibility of harm to the population in the camps at the hands of the Phalangists\\", particularly in the aftermath of the assassination of their leader, the newly elected President of Lebanon, Bashir Gemayel.Final Report, pages 74,75. Secondly they found that he was in dereliction of duty for not following up reports of acts of killings which had become known within hours of the Phalangist entry into Shatila camp. They record that he had a meeting with the Phalangist leaders on the following day in Beirut and did not raise the issue. At this meeting he expressed satisfaction with the Phalangist operation and agreed to provide further support.Final Report, page 78. In its recommendations the commission noted that Eitan was due to retire in April 1983 and therefore resolved \\"that it is sufficient to determine responsibility without making any further recommendation.\\"Final Report, page 106. In a book co-authored by Ze'ev Schiff, military correspondent of Ha'aretz, and Ehud Ya'ari, Middle East Affairs correspondent for Israeli television,Israel's Lebanon War, Simon and Schuster, 1984 published a year after the Kahan Report, new information came to light, that suggested that Eitan was aware of the feelings of the Phalangists before he and Sharon decided to send the militia into the refugee camps. During a minuted meeting at the Defense Minister's office at 5 pm on Thursday 16 September 1982 between US diplomats including Morris Draper and Sharon, Eitan, Saguy, and two other senior Defense Ministry staff, Draper was informed of the Israeli plan to send the Phalangists into the camps. A heated exchange followed, centering on which Lebanese force was to enter the camps. Draper insisted that it should be the regular Lebanese army. At this point Eitan broke into the discussion:Israel's Lebanon War, p. 259 > They're not up to it. Let me explain to you. Lebanon is at a point of > exploding into a frenzy of revenge. No one can stop them. Yesterday we spoke > with the Phalange about their plans. They don't have a strong command.... > They're obsessed with the idea of revenge.

I'm telling you that > some of their commanders visited me, and I could see in their eyes that it's > going to be a relentless slaughter. A number of incidents already happened > today, and it's a good thing we were there, rather than the Lebanese army, > to prevent it from going further. Schiff and Ya'ari continue: \\"To hear Eitan tell it, the IDF was the last obstacle to a bloodthirsty rampage by the Phalange. Of course, he neglected to state that the Phalange forces were waiting outside Shatila at that very moment, because he, among others, had encouraged them to fight in the camps\\". Political career After his retirement from the army in April 1983,Israel's military chief retires and is replaced by his Deputy -- New York Times 20 April 1983 Eitan entered politics. He had the image of the sabra Israeli who connected to his roots and to the land. His background in agriculture and hobbies such as wood work and flight contributed to this image, which attracted many in the Israeli public. Eitan was considered to be a conservative advocating tough policies towards the Palestinians.BBC News, \\"Former Israeli army chief drowns\\", 23 November 2004: \\"He once said: \\"When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle.\\" On 12 April 1983 Eitan said in a Knesset committee meeting: \\"The Arabs will never defeat us by throwing stones. Our answer will be a nationalist Zionist solution. For every stone throwing ‚Äì we'll establish ten settlements. If there will be ‚Äì and there will be ‚Äì a hundred settlements between Nablus and Jerusalem, no stones will be thrown\\"Chief of Staff: A settlement for every stone Yedioth Ahronoth, 13 April 1983 and on another occasion remarked \\"When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle\\".http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4034765.stm Eitan initially joined the Tehiya party and was first elected to the Knesset in 1984. Later he established an ultra-nationalist party called Tzomet, which had conservative views on defense and foreign policy but a liberal and secular domestic platform. He was elected to the 11th Knesset and served as Minister of Agriculture between 1988 and 1991, when Tzomet left the government. In the 1992 elections, Tzomet achieved a record of eight seats, but Eitan refused to join Yitzhak Rabin's coalition. Eitan was a supporter of the Israeli alliance with Apartheid-era South Africa. Eitan has been accused of expressing racist sentiments towards Arabs. Blacks in South Africa, he claimed, \\"want to gain control over the white minority just like the Arabs here want to gain control over us. And we, like the white minority in South Africa, must act to prevent them from taking over\\".Israel's Shady Arms Deal The Daily Beast, 22 June 2010 Eitan had troubles in controlling his party, resulting in some Knesset members splitting from Tzomet to join other parties. When Rabin presented the Oslo II Accords to the Knesset, it managed to pass only with the support of Alex Goldfarb and Gonen Segev ‚Äì two Tzomet members who were promised ministries by Rabin in return for their support. On 1996, Tzomet joined an alliance of Likud and Gesher headed by Benjamin Netanyahu. Although the triumvarate lost the Knesset election to Labour, Netanyahu won the election for Prime Minister, allowing him to form the government. Eitan was promised the ministry of internal security, but a criminal investigation against him blocked his nomination. The investigation eventually cleared Eitan and the case was closed on 1998 due to \\"lack of evidence\\". In the meantime, Eitan served as Agriculture and Environment Minister and also as a Deputy Prime Minister (1998‚Äì99). In 1999 Tzomet failed to win any Knesset seats and Eitan retired from politics. Death On 23 November 2004, Eitan arrived at the Mediterranean sea port of Ashdod, where he was overseeing a port expansion project. A large wave swept him from a breakwater into the sea and he drowned. He was lost in rough waters for over an hour before his body was recovered by the Israeli Navy. He was pronounced dead after efforts to revive him failed.Former Israeli army chief drowns BBC News, 23 November 2004 Bibliography *A Soldier's Story: The Life and Times of an Israeli War Hero by Raful Eitan () See also *List of Israel's Chiefs of the General Staff References  External links  * *Rafael Eitan's biography Knesset website *Rafael \\"Raful\\" Eitan Jewish Virtual Library 1929 births 2004 deaths Palmach members Deaths by drowning Israeli Jews Israeli people of Russian-Jewish descent Israeli people of the Yom Kippur War Accidental deaths in Israel People from Afula Recipients of the Medal of Courage Tehiya politicians Tzomet leaders Israeli generals Members of the 11th Knesset (1984‚Äì1988) Members of the 12th Knesset (1988‚Äì1992) Members of the 13th Knesset (1992‚Äì1996) Members of the 14th Knesset (1996‚Äì1999) Ministers of Agriculture of Israel Ministers of Environment of Israel ","title":"Rafael Eitan"},{"id":"1201285","text":"USS Sequoia has been the name of more than one United States Navy ship, and may refer to * , a presidential yacht purchased in 1931 and commissioned 1933, remaining in service until 1977; currently privately owned * , a lightship in commission from 1917 to 1919 See also United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Sequoia"},{"id":"1201292","text":"\\"Murder Mysteries\\" is a fantasy short story by Neil Gaiman first published in the 1992 anthology Midnight Graffiti and later collected in his collections Angels and Visitations and Smoke and Mirrors.

In Standard American bidding, the response of 1NT to an opening bid of 1 or 1 shows 6 to 9 high card points (HCP) and is non-forcing. Opener, with a balanced minimum, may pass the 1NT response and, if the opponents also pass, that will become the contract. A partnership may agree that this bid is forcing for one round; if the intervening opponent passes, opener must bid at least once more. This guarantees the responder at least one more opportunity to bid or pass. This mechanism allows the partnership to use the 1NT response for a greater variety of hands: in particular, invitational as well as minimum responder holdings. The forcing notrump is used over major suits only; 1NT is always standard and non-forcing over the minor suits. The forcing 1NT bid shows 6 to 12 HCP, denies the ability to make a single raise (but not necessarily an invitational raise), and denies holding four spades if the opening bid was 1; it must be as \\"forcing\\" by partner. As the forcing notrump creates problems of its own, a popular variation that overcomes these is the forcing next step. Opener's rebid Opener is forced to bid again: *two of original major shows a six-card suit *two of a lower-ranking suit shows a second suit (which of necessity may be short - see below) *2NT is natural and invitational (showing about 18 HCP) *three of a new suit (jump shift) is natural, normally agreed to be game-forcing, and shows about 19 points or more When opener does not have a six-card original suit nor a four-card lower- ranking second suit, she will have to bid a short suit. Normally, she bids her three-card minor. If she has three cards in both minors, she bids 2. If opener holds exactly four spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs (and thus originally opened 1), she bids 2, a two-card suit. There is no point in showing the spades, because responder has denied holding four spades (having skipped the 1 response to bid 1NT). After a 1 opening, however, there is no distribution that would compel opener to rebid a two-card suit. Some partnerships agree not to rebid a two-card suit, preferring to promise a minimum of three cards. This allows responder to pass with zero or one hearts and four or more clubs. Instead, these partnerships rebid 2 (violating rule #1), or pass (if playing Semi-forcing notrump.) The forcing next step variation (discussed below) overcomes these problems by allowing opener to show a balanced hand, or any second suit and guarantee four cards in it, yet still offer the option of playing in two of the major. Responder's rebid Responder categorizes her hand as either minimum (6-9 HCP) or invitational (10-12 HCP). The minimum responder rebids are: *two of opener's original major (shows two-card support) *two of a new suit (shows a five-card or longer suit; some play a six-card or longer suit) *pass denies either of the above (shows a distinct preference for opener's second-bid suit) The invitational responder rebids are: *three of opener's original major (shows exactly a three-card limit raise) *three of a new suit (shows a six-card or longer suit) *2NT (natural) *three of opener's second suit (shows at least four-card support) *over a first suit of hearts unusual 2 may apply (see below) Variation. There is more than one school of thought for responder's second call. The above text represents only one theory. Another widely utilized theory is: With a minimum (6-9 support points): *pass (or raise) holding five or more cards in the suit bid: exception - see false preference. *bid openers first suit with two-card support: exception see false preference. *pass holding four or more cards in the current suit bid *with a six-card or longer suit with reasonable top-cards in the suit, bid that if it is between the current suit and two of openers suit. Example: (opponents passing) 1 ‚Äì 1NT; 2 ‚Äì ?. 2 would fit this bid, but 2 would not (as the responder would have bid 1 the first time, see Unusual two spades below) *if none of these options work, usually pass with 3 in the current suit, otherwise bid openers first suit false preference (see below) may apply. Further bidding When responder rebids two of a new suit, opener should pass with a minimum and two or more cards in the suit. With a singleton or void in responder's suit, opener should rebid her original major. Responder may yet have a doubleton there and pass, or will be able correct to three of opener's second suit or her own good six-card (or longer) suit. In this way, the partnership is normally assured of at least a seven-card fit. After an invitational responder rebid, opener is expected to pass (or sign off below game) with a minimum opening hand, or to bid game with extra values. In line with the above Variation, when responder bids their own suit it is 'drop- dead', and Pass should be the expected response. However, with a good hand and three-card or more support, a raise may be appropriate. Otherwise, the only reason to bid should be a good hand with no cards in the bid suit, and extra length in one of the first two suits, as partner has at most one card in our major and three cards in our minor. Tactical raise When responder has a very weak hand (0-4 points), but yet support for opener's major (three or more cards), standard bidding dictates a pass (because opener may have a very good hand and get over-enthused after a single raise). This may allow the opponents to get into the bidding at a low level. Playing the forcing notrump, however, it is sometimes tactically advantageous to bid 1NT with this hand and then correct to 2 of opener's major. The 1NT bid tends to shut out the opponents and make partner cautious at the same time. System implications The forcing notrump is generally used by players using the 2/1 game forcing system, but may be used to advantage by other players as well. False preference When in the maxi-minimum range (8-9 support points), and holding two cards in opener's major and five cards in opener's minor, you are worried about passing and missing game when partner has some extra-values. So you take 'preference' to two of opener's major. This keeps the bidding alive and allows partner to take another call even though your preference would in fact be for the minor. When in the mini-minimum range (6-7 support points) and holding two cards in opener's major and four cards in opener's minor, you Pass. Even though the 'rule' says to prefer the major, the last thing you need is for partner to take another bid with extra values. By passing in a known fit, you hope to ensure the partnership a plus score. Unusual two spades Specific to the auctions: 1 ‚Äì 1NT - 2 and 1 ‚Äì 1NT - 2. In these auctions responder is known to have fewer than 4 spades. Thus, a call of 2 would have no sensible meaning. In these situations the raise of partner's minor is a slightly weaker hand, and the 2 bid is a 'power' raise to opener's minor, usually based on five or more of partners minor and invitational values. Semi-forcing notrump As a variation, some partnerships choose to play their 1NT response as semi-forcing. The rebids and subsequent auctions are the same as with the forcing notrump, except that the opener is allowed to pass with a 5-3-3-2 minimum and no interest in game opposite a limit raise (including three-card support for opener's major). This changes follow-up auctions in that opener is assumed to either have four or more cards in any new suit bid, or some extra values when holding only three cards in a newly bid minor. Forcing next step With this approach, the next step bid over the major open is forcing and unspecified. \\"Forcing next step,\\" also known as the \\"Kaplan Inversion\\", is a mid-chart convention in the ACBL. *1 - 1NT is forcing, unspecified *1 - 1 is forcing, with responder having 0-4 spades *1 - 1NT is forcing with responder showing 5+ spades. One immediate benefit of this is that the correct major fit can be found. In standard forcing notrump, responder with five spades bids 1 over opener's 1 but if she also has 2 hearts she does not then know whether to rebid 2 or 2. In forcing next step, opener will raise 1 - 1NT to 2 if she has support, so if she makes another bid, responder can happily give preference to 2. The forcing next step approach has the further benefit over the classic forcing notrump of allowing an opener with a balanced hand to define his point count range more tightly. Here is a simple approach. Assuming the use of strong 1NT openings, the sequence 1 - 1 - 1NT would show a balanced 12-14 HCP with five hearts and 1 - 1 - 2NT would show 18-19 HCP with five hearts. Here is a more complex approach: Over a sequence of 1 - 1NT, opener rebids: *2 = 12-16, four clubs, or balanced. (2 from responder finds out which, as well as the strength range.) *2/ = 12-16, four-card suit *2 = 12-16, six-card or longer suit *2NT = 17-18 balanced *3 any = 17+ natural If responder wishes to know further about the 2 bid, she asks with 2. Opener rebids 2 = 12-14 balanced, 2 = 12-14 club suit, 2NT = 15-16 balanced, 3 = 15-16 clubs. Similarly with a sequence starting 1 - 1, opener rebids: *1NT = 12-16, balanced, or four spades. (2 from partner finds out which, as well as the strength range.) *2/ = 12-16, four-card suit *2 = 12-16, six-card or longer suit *2NT = 17-18 balanced *3 any = 17+ natural If responder wishes to know further about the 1NT bid, she asks with 2. Opener rebids 2 = 12-14 balanced, 2 = 12-14 spade suit, 2 = 15-16 spade suit, 2NT = 15-16 balanced. Note that if responder and opener both have four spades, they can still play in 2 in spite of the artificial response. Bridge conventions ","title":"Forcing notrump"},{"id":"1201306","text":"Enantiodromia ( ‚Äì opposite and Œ¥œÅœåŒºŒøœÇ, dromos ‚Äì running course) is a principle introduced in the West by psychiatrist Carl Jung. In Psychological Types, Jung defines enantiodromia as \\"the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time. This characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, one-sided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control.\\" It is similar to the principle of equilibrium in the natural world, in that any extreme is opposed by the system in order to restore balance. When things get to their extreme, they turn into their opposite. However, in Jungian terms, a thing psychically transmogrifies into its shadow opposite, in the repression of psychic forces that are thereby cathected into something powerful and threatening. This principle was explicitly understood and discussed in the principles of traditional Chinese religion ‚Äì as in Taoism and yin-yang. A central premise of the I Ching is that yang lines become yin when they have reached their extreme, and vice versa. Overview The word \\"enantiodromia\\" was apparently coined by StobaeusStobaeus: Eclogarum, Physicarum et ethicarum: pp. (Libri duo, Vol 1, 60) but the concept is implied also in Heraclitus's writings. In fr. 126, for example, Heraclitus says \\"cold things warm, warm things cool, wet things dry and parched things get wet.\\"Heraclitus discourse. Copyright ¬© Samuel B√©reau It also seems implicit in other of his sayings, like \\"war is father of all, king of all\\" (fr. 53), \\"they do not know that the differing/opposed thing agrees with itself; harmony is reflexive (œÄŒ±ŒªŒØŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÄŒøœÇ palintropos, used of a compound bow, or \\"in reflexive tension\\"), like the bow and the lyre\\" (fr. 51). In these passages and others the idea of the coincidence of opposites is clearly articulated in Heraclitus' characteristic riddling style, as well as the dynamic motion back and forth between the two, generated especially by opposition and conflict. Jung himself wrote: \\"Old Heraclitus, who was indeed a very great sage, discovered the most marvellous of all psychological laws: the regulative function of opposites. He called it enantiodromia, a running contrariwise, by which he meant that sooner or later everything runs into its opposite.\\" Roughly a generation later, Plato in the Phaedo will articulate the principle clearly: \\"Everything arises in this way, opposites from their opposites.\\" (sect. 71a).Plato, Phaedo, ¬ß57a, ¬ß71a Since Jung's modern recognition of it many centuries later, it has been actively portrayed in modern culture. For example, it has been applied to the subject of the film The Lives of Others, to show how one devoted to a communist regime breaks through his loyalty and emerges a humanist. In particular, Jung used the term to refer to the unconscious acting against the wishes of the conscious mind, updating the Greek concept of akrasia in modern psychological terms. (Aspects of the Masculine, chapter 7, paragraph 294). > Enantiodromia. Literally, \\"running counter to,\\" referring to the emergence > of the unconscious opposite in the course of time. This characteristic > phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, one-sided tendency > dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is > built up, which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently > breaks through the conscious control. (\\"Definitions,\\" ibid., par. 709) Enantiodromia is typically experienced in conjunction with symptoms associated with acute neurosis, and often foreshadows a rebirth of the personality. > The grand plan on which the unconscious life of the psyche is constructed is > so inaccessible to our understanding that we can never know what evil may > not be necessary in order to produce good by enantiodromia, and what good > may very possibly lead to evil. (\\"The Phenomenology of the Spirit in > Fairytales\\", Collected Works 9i, par. 397) Enantiodromia also refers to the process whereby one seeks out and embraces an opposing quality from within, internalizing it in a way that results in individual wholeness. This process is the crux of Jung's notion called the \\"path of individuation.\\" One must incorporate an opposing archetype into their psyche to obtain a state of internal 'completion.'

For nearly six decades he advanced ethnographic and anthropological studies, as well as archeological research, and as a scholar was a prolific writer and public figure renowned as a staunch defender of indigenous peoples. Reichel- Dolmatoff has worked with other archaeologists and anthropologists such as Marianne Cardale de Schrimpff, Ana Mar√≠a Groot, Gonzalo Correal Urrego and others. He died in 1994 in Colombia.  Personal life  He was born in 1912 in Salzburg, then part of Austria-Hungary, as son of the artist Carl Anton Reichel and Hilde Constance Dolmatoff. Oriented in the classics (Latin and Greek) he did most of his high school at the Benedictine school of Kremsmunster in Austria. He attended classes at the Facult√© des Lettres of the Sorbonne and in the √âcole du Louvre from late 1937 to 1938. Gerardo emigrated to Colombia in 1939, where he became a Colombian citizen in 1942. Biography Reichel-Dolmatoff - Banco de la Rep√∫blica Reichel became member and was the Secretary to the 'France Libre'/Free (1942-1943) France Movement with the help of his colleague and friend the French ethnologist Paul Rivet who was the Delegate of the Resistance of France Libre and living in Colombia. General Charles De Gaulle later awarded Reichel-Dolmatoff with the medal of the Ordre du M√©rite. The rest of his life Reichel-Dolmatoff spent in research in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, ethnoecology, ethnohistory, ethnoastronomy, material culture, art, vernacular architecture, among others.  Career  Reichel-Dolmatoff developed a keen interest for conducting fieldwork which would take him and his studies throughout the country, the Caribbean area, La Guajira desert, the Choc√≥ rainforests, the Llanos Orientales, to the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Amazon rainforests. Some of Reichel-Dolmatoff's archeological research was essential in creating the basic chronological framework for most of the Colombian area, and is still used today. In a trip to the upper Meta River in the Orinoco plains in 1940, he conducted research and later published the earliest studies done on the Guahibo Indians. In 1943 Gerardo wrote his first article on the Muisca settlement of Soacha. That same year, together with his wife anthropologist and archeologist Alicia Duss√°n, he conducted an analysis on pre-Columbian burial urns of the Magdalena River. Working in the Tolima region inhabited by Amerindians and the renowned indigenous leader Quintin Lame, they also published a study indicating the indigenous culture of the local populations and also indicated the blood type variations among the indigenous groups of the Pijao in the Department of Tolima as further proof of their Amerindian identity as these tribes were arguing over rights to their ancestral territories. Switching residency to the city of Santa Marta in 1946, the Reichel-Dolmatoffs created and headed the Instituto Etnologico del Magdalena in 1945 and created also a small museum about the anthropology and archeology of the Sierra Nevada region. Reichel-Dolmatoff wrote a two volume monography of the Kogi Indians in the 1940s which to this day is considered a classic reference. For the next five years, Gerardo and his colleague and wife conducted research throughout the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta region, focusing particularly on the Tairona descendants, the Kogui, also known as the Kogi or Kaggaba, and also worked with the Arhuaco and Wiwa indigenous groups, as well as ethnography of a peasant community among the people of Aritama (Kankuamo). Reichel-Dolmatoff carried out a regional study of the area covering archeology, ethnohistory and anthropology, making it one of the first such regional studies made in Colombia. Reichel also did research in the Pacific coast and studied amongst others the Kuna of the Caiman Nuevo River, west of the Gulf of Urab√°. Several years later, Reichel published ethnohistorical studies and anthropological research related to the Kogi, demonstrating their connections to ancestral Tairona chiefdoms. In the late 1950s, Reichel and his family moved to the coastal city of Cartagena. Reichel taught classes in medical anthropology at the university there and engaged in programs of public health with an anthropological perspective. Actively involved in archeological excavations in the Caribbean region around Cartagena, in 1954, the Reichel-Dolmatoffs located and also excavated, amongst others, the Barlovento site, which was the first early Formative shell-midden site found in Colombia. At Momil, they conducted the first study of societies engaged in a subsistence change from shifting cultivation (manioc) to corn agriculturalists. After returning to live in Bogot√° in 1960 Reichel was the founder, professor, and first Chair the first Department of Anthropology in Colombia. Reichel did archeological excavations at the site of Puerto Hormiga where they discovered the earliest dated pottery in all of the New World (at that time), -dated over 5 thousand years old- which indicated that pottery had been first developed in the Caribbean coast of Colombia and then spread elsewhere to the rest of the Americas (and hence was not brought through diffusion from the Old World as had been formerly suggested by other archeologists) .(Reichel see biblio). Reichel also excavated in other sites including in San Agustin, Huila. He published his analyses of the Puerto Hormiga site regarding early Formative cultures, and of the San Agustin site regarding chiefdoms. Reichel also produced one of the first overviews of Colombian archeology and proposed an interpretive framework of its millenarian pre-historic past.Reichel-Dolmatoff, G. 1965. 'Colombia: Ancient Peoples and Places'. Thames and Hudson. London In 1963, Reichel and his wife taught courses in anthropology at the Universidad de los Andes, and then in 1964 formally created the first Department of Anthropology in Colombia at the university in Bogot√°. Reichel-Dolmatoff worked for 5 years at the Department and left together with his wife and several other professors due to changes in the Department. Reichel received a short visiting fellowship to Cambridge University in 1970 and became an adjunct professor at the Anthropology Department of the University of California in Los Angeles. During the 1960s and until the mid-1990s Reichel-Dolmatoff advanced research on Amerindian shamanism, indigenous modes of life, ethnoecology, and on cosmologies and worldviews, and he also did research on hallucinogens related to shamanism, entheogens, ethnoastronomy, ethnobotany, ethnozoology, and on the vernacular architecture of temples and of the Amazonian 'maloca' longhouses; additionally he did research on the shamanic symbolism of pre-Columbian goldwork, as well as other Amerindian artifacts and material culture, including basketry. Reichel-Dolmatoff was a member of the Colombian Academy of Sciences, and a Foreign Associate Member of the NAS National Academy of Sciences of the United States and he was also a member of the Academia Real Espa√±ola de Ciencias. He was awarded the Thomas H. Huxley medal by the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland in 1975. Reichel-Dolmatoff was the single author of 40 books and of over 400 articles, all dedicated to the archeology and anthropology of Colombia and specifically highlighting the relevance of indigenous peoples of the past and present. In 1983, Reichel-Dolmatoff was one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), which was created and headed by dr. Abdus Salam (Nobel Prize in Physics) with renowned scientists of the Third World who sought to focus differently on the issues of science and technology for the interests of the developing countries themselves. = International recognition = While living in Colombia for over half a century, Reichel-Dolmatoff provided his professional services to the national and departmental governments, and as university professor, researcher and author to public and private universities. In 1945 he founded in Santa Marta the Instituto Ethnologico Nacional del Magdalena and in the early 1950s he became professor of Medical Anthropology at the University of Cartagena. He occupied, amongst other positions, those of researcher and lecturer of the Instituto Etnologico Nacional and the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and he was Chair and professor of the Department of Anthropology of the Universidad de los Andes. He was visiting professor of the National Museum of Ethnology in Japan. Reichel-Dolmatoff participated in academic congresses and seminars and wrote conference papers in universities and international or national academic events in South America, North America and Central America as well as in Europe, Japan. In the field of archaeology, Reichel-Dolmatoff helped define the early archeological evidence of the Formative Stage in Colombia, based on sites excavated which provided the then most ancient site in all the Americas where pottery had originated over 6,000 years ago, and this research was tied also to new interpretations of the meaning and connections of the cultural evolution of Colombia with other regions of the Americas. Reichel-Dolmatoff researched origins of early chiefdoms and explained the millenarian evolution of Amerindian cultures and their links to contemporary indigenous groups. His excavations focused mainly on living spaces and garbage heaps, where the archaeologist avoided exploring or excavating monumental sculptures, monumental architecture and indigenous burial sites. In the field of anthropology, Reichel-Dolmatoff focused on investigating and celebrating Colombia's ethnic and cultural diversity and especially of indigenous peoples. The scope and extent of his work and dedication to understanding, acknowledging and disseminating the importance and value of Colombia's contemporary indigenous peoples was significant. At a conference in 1987, Reichel-Dolmatoff spoke the following words: > \\"Today I must acknowledge that since the beginning of the 1940s, it has been > for me a real privilege to live with, and also try to understand in depth, > diverse indigenous groups. I noted among them particular mental structures > and value systems that seemed to be beyond any of the typologies and > categories held then by Anthropology.

Dong-okjeo (Eastern Okjeo) occupied roughly the area of the Hamgy≈èng provinces of North Korea, and Buk-okjeo (Northern Okjeo) occupied the Duman River region. Dong- okjeo was often simply called Okjeo, while Buk-okjeo was also sometimes referred to as Chiguru (ÁΩÆÊ∫ùÂ©Å, ÏπòÍµ¨Î£®) or Guru (Íµ¨Î£®), the latter name being also applied to Goguryeo. Okjeo bordered the other minor state of Dongye on the south, and shared a similar fate. History Three Kingdoms, c. 1 CE. In its early history, Okjeo oscillated between domination by the Chinese commanderies and by Goguryeo.Byeon 1999, p. 49. From the 3rd century BCE to 108 BCE, it was controlled by Gojoseon. Due to the constant interference of its neighbours, Okjeo never grew into a fully centralised kingdom. In 28 BCE, King Dongmyeong sent Bu Wiyeom to attack the Northern Okjeo. In the 1st or 2nd century CE, King Taejo of Goguryeo reduced Okjeo to a tributary, which delivered local products to Goguryeo. During the 244 Wei Invasion of Goguryeo, Goguryeo‚Äôs King Dongcheon briefly retreated to North Okjeo, and in 285, the Buyeo court also temporarily escaped to Okjeo under northern nomadic attacks. In early 5th century, Okjeo was completely conquered by Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo. Culture Knowledge of Okjeo culture is fragmentary. As with the Dongye and Okjeo's language, food, clothing, architecture, and customs were similar to that of Goguryeo. The Okjeo people practised arranged marriage by which the child-bride lived with the child-groom's family until adulthood, and they interred the dead of a family in a single coffin.

He scored the first of his many goals (for a right-back) during that season in a 5‚Äì1 defeat of Burnley at Turf Moor on 5 December 1964. Lawler's timing and anticipation, enabling him to turn up in the right place at the right time to score vital goals, earned him the nickname 'The Silent Knight'. The 1964‚Äì5 season culminated in him being selected in the team which beat Leeds United in the FA Cup final at Wembley, winning the trophy for the first time in the club's history. Lawler missed just three games in the next seven seasons. During this period, he helped Liverpool win the League championship in 1966, ahead of Leeds by six points (in the old two points for a win system). This was followed by Liverpool being beaten 2‚Äì1 by Borussia Dortmund in the Cup Winners Cup at Hampden Park, Glasgow, in the Reds' first ever appearance in a major European final. Lawler was an automatic starter on the team that finished second to Leeds for the 1968-69 league championship. He survived manager Bill Shankly's massive cull of 1970 which saw many of the older 1960s stars replaced by younger talent. Other than Lawler, only Emlyn Hughes, Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith were retained. Lawler again tasted defeat when he played in the 1971 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal. Liverpool won a League title and UEFA Cup double in 1973. Liverpool finished three points ahead of Arsenal in the league, while in the UEFA Cup final Liverpool defeated Borussia M√∂nchengladbach 3‚Äì2 on aggregate (won the first leg 3‚Äì0 at Anfield, lost the second leg 0‚Äì2 in West Germany). It was during this period that Lawler won his four England caps. He scored on his debut, in the 5‚Äì0 defeat of Malta in a UEFA European Football Championship qualifier at Wembley on 12 May 1971. He was on the bench, after a spell out injured, as Liverpool reached the FA Cup final again in 1974. As the 12th man, he received a winner's medal when Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3‚Äì0, but he did not see any action. Bill Shankly's sudden departure from the club in the summer of 1974 marked the downturn of Lawler's Liverpool career. New manager Bob Paisley purchased specialist right back Phil Neal from Northampton Town at the end of the year, and thereafter Lawler played only sporadically. He made his final Liverpool appearance against Hibernian in a UEFA Cup tie on 17 September 1975. Lawler joined Portsmouth in October '75, who were managed by former Liverpool teammate Ian St John. Lawler later joined Stockport County in 1978. He also played for Welsh League side Bangor City. In 1976, he played the summer on loan to the Miami Toros of the North American Soccer League.NASL Stats In 1980‚Äì81 Chris Lawler played and coached second-level club Raufoss I.L. in the Norwegian league system. Lawler became a coach at Liverpool FC after his playing days were over until he was acrimoniously released from his duties in 1986. Rumours about something involving his release and the man who replaced him ‚Äì Phil Thompson, surfaced at the time. Lawler has kept a low profile since then, though has done some work for Liverpool, scouting for players. He also works in Skelmersdale, coaching young children. Lawler was voted in at No.51 in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop poll on the Liverpool FC Club website.

Both the short story and the graphic novel were written by Neil Gaiman. The latter was drawn by John Bolton, and published by Dark Horse Books. The short story has been republished in Fragile Things. Overview The story takes place on February 14 with the harlequin giving Missy his heart, literally, by nailing it to her door. The story follows the unflappable Missy as she tries to discover who gave her this gift, and what she does with it. The merry harlequin follows her the whole time, wondering what this Columbina, as he calls his various loves he has given his heart to, will do with it. True to his classic trickster ways, in the same vein as Puck, he's constantly meddling with other people's lives and causing mischief as he goes, which often get blamed on Pierrot. The story concludes with Missy eating the raw heart (with a side of hash browns and ketchup) at a diner; she is transformed into a new harlequin, while the old harlequin is transformed into a kitchen helper named Pete, who has no memories of ever being the harlequin. The story includes many of the classic characters from the Harlequinade in modern forms. Most obviously is Harlequin and his sought- after love Columbina, who is named Missy in this modern version. Pantaloon, the third person in the love triangle, also exists here in full. The artwork is a mixture of digitally enhanced photographs overlaid with painting. This serves the story very well as the fantastic Harlequin follows and interacts with the sensible Missy in her normal world. The backgrounds are made very drab, compared to the colorful characters which almost vibrate on top of them. At the back of the book is Gaiman's essay, \\"Notes on a Harlequinade,\\" which tells us a little about the old harlequin stories of the Italian Commedia dell'arte and the English Harlequinade. Stage adaptation A stage adaptation of this graphic novel has been produced by Metatron's Men () group made of members of ≈ölƒÖski Klub Fantastyki (Polish: Silesian Science Fiction Club), starring Jakub ƒÜwiek as the harlequin and Klaudia Heintze as Missy.

The military historian Hew Strachan wrote that military strategy led an over-reliance on shrapnel to attack infantry in the open, which was negated by the resort to trench warfare, for which high-explosive shells were better suited. At the start of the war there was a revolution in doctrine: instead of the idea that artillery was a useful support for infantry attacks, the new doctrine held that heavy guns alone would control the battlefield. Because of the stable lines on the Western Front, it was easy to build railway lines that delivered all the shells the factories could produce. The \\"shell scandal\\" emerged in 1915 because the high rate of fire over a long period was not anticipated and the stock of shells became depleted. The shortage was widely publicized in the press. The Times, in cooperation with David Lloyd George and Lord Northcliffe, sought to force Parliament to adopt a national munitions policy with centralised control. The result was a coalition government with Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions. In 1916 the long-term effects included the fall of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and his replacement by Lloyd George in December 1916. The Times attacks Kitchener Shortage of ammunition had been a serious problem since the autumn of 1914 and the British Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Sir John French gave an interview to The Times (27 March) calling for more ammunition. Lord Northcliffe, the owner of The Times and the Daily Mail, blamed Herbert Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, for the recent death in action of his nephew. On the basis of an assurance from Kitchener, Asquith, stated in a speech at Newcastle (20 April) that the army had sufficient ammunition. After the failure of the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915, The Times war correspondent, Colonel Charles √† Court Repington, sent a telegram to his newspaper blaming lack of high-explosive shells. French had, despite Repington‚Äôs denial of his prior knowledge at the time, supplied him with information and sent Brinsley Fitzgerald and Freddy Guest to London to show the same documents to Lloyd George and senior Conservatives Bonar Law and Arthur Balfour. The Times headline on 14 May 1915, was: \\"Need for shells: British attacks checked: Limited supply the cause: A Lesson From France\\". It commented \\"We had not sufficient high explosives to lower the enemy's parapets to the ground ... The want of an unlimited supply of high explosives was a fatal bar to our success\\", blaming the government for the battle's failure. Coalition Government The visit of the opposition leaders to Asquith on 17 May was caused more by the resignation of John Fisher as First Sea Lord on 15 May than by the Shells Scandal. As a result of the meeting Asquith wrote to his ministers demanding their resignations. Asquith formed a new coalition government and appointed Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions. Although Liberal politicians held office in subsequent coalitions, no purely Liberal government has held office since May 1915. Daily Mail attacks Kitchener A sensational version of the story was printed in the popular Daily Mail on 21 May, blaming Kitchener, under the headline \\"The Shells Scandal: Lord Kitchener‚Äôs Tragic Blunder\\". Lloyd George had to warn Northcliffe that the campaign was counterproductive and creating sympathy for Kitchener. Kitchener wanted to let the Shells Scandal drop. Von Donop, Master-General of the Ordnance, demanded an Inquiry to clear his name but Kitchener persuaded him to withdraw the request as it would have led to French‚Äôs dismissal. Kitchener remained in office as Secretary of State for War, responsible for training and equipping the volunteer New Armies but lost control over munitions production and was increasingly sidelined from control of military strategy. French was also tarnished by his blatant meddling in politics, a factor which contributed to his enforced resignation in December 1915. Ministry of Munitions The Munitions of War Act 1915 ended the shell crisis and guaranteed a supply of munitions that the Germans were unable to match. The government policy, according to J. A. R. Marriott, was that, > No private interest was to be permitted to obstruct the service, or imperil > the safety, of the State. Trade Union regulations must be suspended; > employers' profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the > trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economized by the dilution of > labour and the employment of women; private factories must pass under the > control of the State, and new national factories be set up. Results > justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last > delivered. Following the creation of the Ministry of Munitions, new factories began to be built for the mass production of war material. The construction of these factories took time and to ensure that there was no delay in the production of munitions to deal with the Shell Crisis, the Government turned to railway companies to manufacture materials of war. Railway companies were well placed to manufacture munitions and other war materials, with their large locomotive, carriage works and skilled labourers; by the end of 1915 the railway companies were producing between 1,000 and 5,000 6-inch. H.E. shells per week. As well as the components for a number of different types of shell, the Railway companies, under the direction of the Railway War Manufactures Sub-Committee of the Railway Executive Committee, produced mountings for larger artillery, water-tank carts, miners' trucks, heavy-capacity wagons, machinery for howitzer carriages, armoured trains and ambulances. In 1916, when the many factories being constructed by the Ministry of Munitions began producing large volumes of munitions, the work of the Railway Companies in producing war materials actually increased and they continued to produce high volumes of munitions throughout the war. The official record, presented to the Government in May 1920, of the munitions work done throughout the war by the various railway companies ran to a total of 121 pages, giving some idea of the scale of what was undertaken by the Railway Companies across the country. Many of the companies undertook this vital war work to the detriment of the maintenance of their locomotives, carriages and wagons. The Munitions of War Act 1915 prevented the resignation of munitions workers without their employer's consent. It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be mobilised for the war effort if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front. Supplies and factories in British Commonwealth countries, particularly Canada, were reorganised under the Imperial Munitions Board, to supply adequate shells and other materiel for the remainder of the war. The Health of Munitions Workers Committee, one of the first investigations into occupational safety and health, was set up in 1915 to improve productivity in factories. A huge munitions factory, HM Factory, Gretna was built on the English-Scottish border to produce Cordite. There were at least three major explosions in such factories: # An explosion at Faversham involving 200 tons of TNT killed 105 in 1916. # The National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell exploded in 1918, killing 137. # The Silvertown explosion occurred in Silvertown (now part of the London Borough of Newham, in Greater London) killing 73 and injuring 400 on Friday, 19 January 1917 at 6.52 pm.
