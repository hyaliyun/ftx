The gallery was formally launched on Sunday 27 January 2007; since 2014 it has been run by Teesside University.  History and estates  The gallery's opening marked the completion of an accumulative journey for the art collection of post- industrial Middlesbrough. The early artistic heritage of a town as young as Middlesbrough rested largely on the success of the Linthorpe Art Pottery (1879‚Äì1889), co-launched by Christopher Dresser out of the Sun Brickworks that also built the suburb of Linthorpe. A School of Art opened alongside the Mechanics' Institute in the old town's Durham Street, in 1870, and by the 1950s that, too, had relocated to Linthorpe. The region's cultural profile was further amply boosted by the Cleveland International Drawing Biennale, until that competition's extinction in the 1990s. A site for the town's first art gallery was granted by the father of the Mayor, Sir Arthur Dorman, in 1904. This was on Linthorpe Road opposite, and conceived in the same spate of events as, what was to become the Dorman Museum outside Albert Park. Funding shortfalls amid the onset of war, however, ensured that only a rest garden was eventually sited there. In the meantime, from 1927, the Carnegie library and Grange Road Methodist Church housed the collection of paintings. No permanent provision for the pieces materialised until 1957, with the purchase by the Council of a former doctor's surgery on Linthorpe Road. It was not until 2003 that this building was vacated. Cleveland GalleryThe former Cleveland Crafts Centre, on Gilkes Street, catered for a collection of twentieth-century British studio ceramics, and artist-made jewellery dating from the 1970s onwards. The Cleveland Crafts Centre was closed as an exhibition venue in January 2003, and thereafter operated as the mima offices whilst the new gallery was being constructed. Its sister institution that lasted until 1999, the Cleveland Gallery, resided nearby in the unused school buildings on Victoria Road. They are today home to the University of Teesside's graduate incubation studios in aid of new business start-ups. Following the closure in January 2003 of the two surviving galleries, construction of the present accommodation comprising the gallery spaces, education suite, auditorium, caf√©-bar, shop, roof terrace, collection stores and conservation studio commenced in 2004. The centre was designed by Erick van Egeraat Associated Architect. Whilst construction was underway, mima programmed a series of offsite exhibitions and events including such artists as John Harrison and Paul Wood, Susan Pietzsch, Yuka Oyama, Graham Dolphin, Chicks on Speed, Martin Creed, Oliver Zwink and Mah Rana. mima's founding director was Godfrey Worsdale, who left in 2008 to become director of the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art.Baltic's latest director ‚Äì the Guardian He was succeeded by Kate Brindley, previously director of Museums and Galleries at Bristol City CouncilNew director appointed at mima ‚Äì the Gazette She was briefly succeeded by Mark Robinson, who was acting director during the transition of ownership between the local authority and the university, and managed the recruitment of Alistair Hudson, previously Deputy Director at Grizedale Arts, who took on the role in 2014 and left in 2017 to become Director of the Manchester Art Gallery and the Whitworth. The current director is Laura Sillars, who joined from Sheffield's Site Gallery. mima has participated in the Tate‚Äôs programme Artist Rooms, featuring exhibitions by Gerhard Richter, Jannis Kounellis and Louise Bourgeois. On 21 and 22 November 2009, the cast of the BBC motoring programme Top Gear ‚Äì Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May ‚Äì held an exhibition of automotive art at mima, which featured in the 5th episode of the 14th series of the show.  Collection  mima's collection comprises outstanding fine and applied art from 19th century to the present day, with many pieces acquired by mima‚Äôs forerunners, Middlesbrough Art Gallery and the Cleveland Craft Centre. mima's collection includes works by Frank Auerbach, Elizabeth Blackadder, David Bomberg, Ken Currie, Jeremy Deller, Tracey Emin, Sir Jacob Epstein, Dame Elisabeth Frink, David Hockney, Peter Howson, Gwen John, Panayiotis Kalorkoti, L.S. Lowry, Ben Nicholson, Eduardo Paolozzi, Adrian Piper, Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie, Anne Redpath, Paula Rego, David Remfry, Lucie Rie, Stanley Spencer, Nancy Spero and Kara Walker. In 2015, Tees Valley Arts donated a collection of significant artworks to the gallery as the Tees Valley Arts Collection, including works by artists Vivan Sundaram, Len Tabner and Adrian Wiszniewski.

He was generally referred to by his contemporaries and posterity as General Perron.Biographie universelle et portative des contemporains, Paris, 1826, p. 900. In 1780 he went out to India as a sailor on a French frigate, deserted on the Malabar coast, and made his way to upper India, where he enlisted in the rana of Gohad's corps under a Scotsman named Sangster. In 1790 he took service under De Boigne, and was appointed to the command of his second brigade. In 1795 he assisted the Maratha forces to win the battle of Kardla against the nizam of Hyderabad, and on De Boigne's retirement became commander-in-chief of Maratha general Mahadji Sindhia's army. At the battle of Malpura (1800) he defeated the Rajput forces. After the battle of Ujjain (1801) he refused to send his troops to the aid of Scindia.

He was one of the first American researchers in abstract algebra, in particular the theory of finite fields and classical groups, and is also remembered for a three-volume history of number theory, History of the Theory of Numbers. Life Dickson considered himself a Texan by virtue of having grown up in Cleburne, where his father was a banker, merchant, and real estate investor. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, where George Bruce Halsted encouraged his study of mathematics. Dickson earned a B.S. in 1893 and an M.S. in 1894, under Halsted's supervision. Dickson first specialised in Halsted's own specialty, geometry.A. A. Albert (1955) Leonard Eugene Dickson 1874‚Äì1954 from National Academy of Sciences Both the University of Chicago and Harvard University welcomed Dickson as a Ph.D. student, and Dickson initially accepted Harvard's offer, but chose to attend Chicago instead. In 1896, when he was only 22 years of age, he was awarded Chicago's first doctorate in mathematics, for a dissertation titled The Analytic Representation of Substitutions on a Power of a Prime Number of Letters with a Discussion of the Linear Group, supervised by E. H. Moore. Dickson then went to Leipzig and Paris to study under Sophus Lie and Camille Jordan, respectively. On returning to the US, he became an instructor at the University of California. In 1899 and at the extraordinarily young age of 25, Dickson was appointed associate professor at the University of Texas. Chicago countered by offering him a position in 1900, and he spent the balance of his career there. At Chicago, he supervised 53 Ph.D. theses; his most accomplished student was probably A. A. Albert. He was a visiting professor at the University of California in 1914, 1918, and 1922. In 1939, he returned to Texas to retire. Dickson married Susan McLeod Davis in 1902; they had two children, Campbell and Eleanor. Dickson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1913, and was also a member of the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the London Mathematical Society, the French Academy of Sciences and the Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists. Dickson was the first recipient of a prize created in 1924 by The American Association for the Advancement of Science, for his work on the arithmetics of algebras. Harvard (1936) and Princeton (1941) awarded him honorary doctorates. Dickson presided over the American Mathematical Society in 1917‚Äì1918. His December 1918 presidential address, titled \\"Mathematics in War Perspective\\", criticized American mathematics for falling short of those of Britain, France, and Germany: :\\"Let it not again become possible that thousands of young men shall be so seriously handicapped in their Army and Navy work by lack of adequate preparation in mathematics.\\" In 1928, he was also the first recipient of the Cole Prize for algebra, awarded annually by the AMS, for his book Algebren und ihre Zahlentheorie. It appears that Dickson was a hard man: :\\"A hard-bitten character, Dickson tended to speak his mind bluntly; he was always sparing in his praise for the work of others. ... he indulged his serious passions for bridge and billiards and reportedly did not like to lose at either game.\\"Karen Parshall (1999) \\"Leonard Eugene Dickson\\" in American National Biography, volume 6, Oxford University Press, pp 578‚Äì79 :\\"He delivered terse and unpolished lectures and spoke sternly to his students. ... Given Dickson's intolerance for student weaknesses in mathematics, however, his comments could be harsh, even though not intended to be personal. He did not aim to make students feel good about themselves.\\" :\\"Dickson had a sudden death trial for his prospective doctoral students: he assigned a preliminary problem which was shorter than a dissertation problem, and if the student could solve it in three months, Dickson would agree to oversee the graduate student's work. If not the student had to look elsewhere for an advisor.\\" Work Dickson had a major impact on American mathematics, especially abstract algebra. His mathematical output consists of 18 books and more than 250 papers. The Collected Mathematical Papers of Leonard Eugene Dickson fill six large volumes. The algebraist In 1901, Dickson published his first book Linear groups with an exposition of the Galois field theory, a revision and expansion of his Ph.D. thesis. Teubner in Leipzig published the book, as there was no well-established American scientific publisher at the time. Dickson had already published 43 research papers in the preceding five years; all but seven on finite linear groups. Parshall (1991) described the book as follows: :\\"Dickson presented a unified, complete, and general theory of the classical linear groups‚Äînot merely over the prime field GF(p) as Jordan had done‚Äîbut over the general finite field GF(pn), and he did this against the backdrop of a well-developed theory of these underlying fields. ... his book represented the first systematic treatment of finite fields in the mathematical literature.\\" An appendix in this book lists the non-abelian simple groups then known having order less than 1 billion. He listed 53 of the 56 having order less than 1 million. The remaining three were found in 1960, 1965, and 1967. Dickson worked on finite fields and extended the theory of linear associative algebras initiated by Joseph Wedderburn and Cartan. He started the study of modular invariants of a group. In 1905, Wedderburn, then at Chicago on a Carnegie Fellowship, published a paper that included three claimed proofs of a theorem stating that all finite division algebras were commutative, now known as Wedderburn's theorem. The proofs all made clever use of the interplay between the additive group of a finite division algebra A, and the multiplicative group A* = A ‚àí {0}. Karen Parshall noted that the first of these three proofs had a gap not noticed at the time. Dickson also found a proof of this result but, believing Wedderburn's first proof to be correct, Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. But Dickson also noted that Wedderburn constructed his second and third proofs only after having seen Dickson's proof. She concluded that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof. Dickson's search for a counterexample to Wedderburn's theorem led him to investigate nonassociative algebras, and in a series of papers he found all possible three and four-dimensional (nonassociative) division algebras over a field. In 1919 Dickson constructed Cayley numbers by a doubling process starting with quaternions ‚Ñç. His method was extended to a doubling of ‚Ñù to produce ‚ÑÇ, and of ‚ÑÇ to produce ‚Ñç by A. A. Albert in 1922, and the procedure is known now as the Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction of composition algebras. The number theorist Dickson proved many interesting results in number theory, using results of Vinogradov to deduce the ideal Waring theorem in his investigations of additive number theory. He proved the Waring's problem for k\\\\ge 7 under the further condition of :(3^k + 1)/(2^k - 1)\\\\le [1.5^k] + 1 independently of Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai who proved it for k\\\\ge 6 ahead of him. The three-volume History of the Theory of Numbers (1919‚Äì23) is still much consulted today, covering divisibility and primality, Diophantine analysis, and quadratic and higher forms. The work contains little interpretation and makes no attempt to contextualize the results being described, yet it contains essentially every significant number theoretic idea from the dawn of mathematics up to the 1920s except for quadratic reciprocity and higher reciprocity laws. A planned fourth volume on these topics was never written. A. A. Albert remarked that this three volume work \\"would be a life's work by itself for a more ordinary man.\\" Bibliography *Karen Parshall (1991) \\"A study in group theory: Leonard Eugene Dickson's Linear groups\\", Mathematical Intelligencer 13: 7‚Äì11 () * ()   1926.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 30, 2000. In the episode, Homer suffers from a nervous breakdown after taking a quiz that suggests he only has three years left to live. To calm himself down, he and the rest of the Simpson family go to Florida for vacation. There, they end up in the middle of a raucous spring break. Homer joins in on the party and ends up getting himself and his family in trouble for killing the state's beloved mascot ‚Äì an alligator named Captain Jack. The Simpsons run from the law and take jobs at a small restaurant while hiding from the police. Diedrich Bader guest starred in \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\" as a sheriff that tries to arrest the Simpson family, while Robert Evans and Charlie Rose guest starred in a scene in which Homer watches the two in an interview on television. Kid Rock and Joe C. also made guest appearances as themselves in the episode, performing at a concert in Florida that Homer attends. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jen Kamerman. Around 7.46 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season. Plot Homer gets a magazine loaded with personality tests and quizzes his friends and family with them. Later on, he takes his own test which reveals that has only three years left to live. Terrified of his supposedly impending death, he develops insomnia and goes insane. Homer visits the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's psychiatrist, who suggests that he take a long vacation. The Simpsons go on a trip to Florida and find themselves in the middle of a raucous spring break when they get there. Marge wants Homer to stay in his hotel room, but he escapes to party and attends a concert featuring Joe C. and Kid Rock. Homer becomes the life of spring break until it ends and the wild college students return to their studies. Homer, who still wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous resident and reptile ‚Äì an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier, while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives on the scene, and although Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family flees from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rails for several miles. Eventually, the car is dislodged from the train, and the Simpsons escape to a restaurant, where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors, revealing that he was never killed, but was simply knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (leaving them only able to travel to Arizona or North Dakota). Production Musician Kid Rock appeared in the episode as himself. \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jen Kamerman as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). When the animation department finished its work on the episode, it had ended up being about four minutes too long and the staff of the show was forced to make some difficult cuts. One scene that was cut saw Captain Jack lying in state at the capitol in Florida, with Kid Rock being one of the people present to pay their respects to the alligator. The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully has expressed regret for cutting this scene because it \\"hurts the logic\\" later in the episode when Captain Jack crawls out of the capitol and reveals himself to everyone, thus creating a plot hole due to a lack of any explanation as to how he got there. Actor Diedrich Bader guest starred in the episode as the sheriff.Bader, Diedrich. (2008).

Audio commentary for \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode also features guest appearances from talk show host Charlie Rose and film producer Robert Evans as themselves. Evans and Rose appear in a scene at the beginning of the episode, when Homer stays up late and watches Rose interview Evans on the television, hallucinating them threatening to kill him. Their conversation mentions Evans‚Äô films Love Story and The Two Jakes, as well as Vincent Canby. Musicians Kid Rock and Joe C. also guest star in the episode as themselves, performing at the annual spring break concert that Homer sneaks out to attend. Kid Rock's song \\"Bawitdaba\\" features as part of his appearance. Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two \\"have a lot of stage presence\\" and visually are \\"a funny combination,\\" and because the staff thought \\"they would be funny playing off Homer.\\" According to Scully, the two musicians \\"had a great sense of humor [...] about themselves,\\" with Kid Rock asking if \\"he could add a couple of his own lines. He wanted to introduce himself as 'the pimp of the nation.' We kept that in the show. It's quite a title.\\" Kid Rock recorded some of his dialog over the phone, but also paid a 45-minute visit to the Simpsons studio in Los Angeles to record lines. Scully thought it looked like the singer enjoyed the experience and was surprised to see that he arrived on time. \\"My first reaction to that was, 'What kind of rock star is this?',\\" Scully jokingly told the Detroit Free Press. All of Joe C.'s lines were recorded over the phone. Release and reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 30, 2000. It was viewed in approximately 7.46 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 7.4, the episode finished 46th in the ratings for the week of April 24‚Äì30, 2000. It was the third highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an episode of Malcolm in the Middle (which received an 8.2 rating) and an episode of The X-Files (which received a 7.7 rating). On October 7, 2008, \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\" was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, Matt Selman, Julie Thacker, and Steven Dean Moore, as well as cast member Dan Castellaneta and guest star Diedrich Bader, participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included in the box set. Scully has said that the episode is \\"kind of three stories in one.\\"Scully, Mike. (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Meyer, a writer and producer on the show, said in the DVD audio commentary that the fans thought it was \\"kind of a frenetic and crazy, chaotic episode,\\" adding: \\"I can't disagree. But we had a lot of fun writing it, and we stand by it.\\"Meyer, George. (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: \\"Wow ‚Äì this may be the most jumbled Simpsons to date! The episode seems to suffer from ADD as it can‚Äôt focus on any topic for very long. It flits from one gag to another with abandon and rarely makes much sense ‚Äì or produces many laughs. Yeah, it has a few amusing moments, but it‚Äôs too scattershot to succeed.\\" Annie Alleman of The Herald News, on the other hand, named \\"Kill the Alligator and Run\\" her eighth favorite Simpsons episode. Nancy Basile of About.com thought the best scene of the episode is the one where the Simpsons have become hillbillies and are sitting on their porch, and Bart says \\"I'm getting used to this country life. Teacher says I'm whittling at a tenth-grade level.\\" Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed Kid Rock at number one in his list of the top five worst musical guests in Simpsons history.

There are two \\"Vermilion Rivers\\" in Illinois. The Wabash tributary flows south, while the other Vermilion River flows north to the Illinois River. There are also two Little Vermilion rivers, one flowing into the Wabash River and one into the Illinois. The north-flowing Vermilion River and the south-flowing Middle Fork Vermilion River lie along a straight line connecting Oglesby and Danville. The two rivers drain what was once an upland marsh near Roberts. The two rivers have been extended by drainage ditches so that they nearly connect at their headwaters. The rivers may share a common name because early settlers regarded them as a single river that flowed two directions. The rivers may have served as a canoe route between the Illinois River and Wabash River, with a portage through the marshes near Roberts. Tributaries The main tributaries of the Vermilion River join near Danville: *Salt Fork Vermilion River *Middle Fork Vermilion River *North Fork Vermilion River The Vermilion starts with the confluence of the Salt Fork and Middle Fork, to be joined by the North Fork approximately downstream. The Salt Fork is the western tributary. It arises north of Urbana, flowing east toward Danville. It was named for the saline springs in its lower reaches. When settlers first arrived in the area, the saline springs were the basis of the dominant industry. The Middle Fork arises near Roberts, and flows southeast toward Danville. The Middle Fork is notable as the only river in Illinois designated as a National Wild and Scenic River by United States National Park Service. This scenic stream flows through Kickapoo State Park near Danville and is a favorite of Illinois canoeists. The North Fork arises in Indiana to the northeast of Hoopeston, Illinois. It flows south and southwest toward Danville. From Danville, the Vermilion River flows to its confluence with the Wabash River to the east of the Illinois/Indiana border.

A member of the Republican Party, he died suddenly on April 2, 2010, at age 70. The Thomas J. Moyer Ohio Judicial Center, headquarters of the Ohio Supreme Court, was named in his honor in 2004. Pre-Supreme Court Until his death, Moyer was the longest-serving state chief justice in the United States. Born in Sandusky, Ohio, he attended Sandusky High School and went on to receive both his undergraduate and law degree from The Ohio State University. He served as chairman of the board of directors of the O.S.U. Alumni Association, as well as the board of trustees of Franklin University. From 1979 to 1987, Moyer served on the Tenth District Court of Appeals for Ohio, which covers Franklin County. Prior to his appointment, he served as the president of the Columbus Board of Education. During his tenure there, the board found itself in the middle of desegregation fights, chronicled in the book Getting Around Brown. He also served for four years as an executive assistant to Governor James A. Rhodes (R-Ohio) and eight years in private practice in Sandusky. Moyer was married and lived in Columbus. He was re-elected in 1992, 1998, and 2004. As judge Moyer presided over the DeRolph decision dealing with school funding, as well as the late 1990s' legal battle over tort reform. Although a Republican, Moyer had a strong belief in the principles of stare decisis. In 2001, he created a task force on guardians ad litem in Ohio. In 2004, when the court moved into new quarters, some controversy ensued over the cost involved. On May 15, 2004, the building was dedicated by U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Under Moyer's leadership, the court: * Started the Off-Site Court program after taking office in 1987. The Court visits two local counties per year, and educates high school students about the judiciary. The Court has visited 50 counties, offering a chance to view proceedings to 28,000 Ohioans ‚Äì 22,000 of whom are high school students. * Revamped, in 1989, the statistical case reporting system for judges in the Rules of Superintendence (Sup.R. 37 Appendix A) to increase the accuracy and efficiency of reporting. Created a separate statistical case reporting section at the Court. * Amended, in 1996, the Rules for the Government of the Bar to create a process requiring lawyer referral services to register with the Court so the Court can facilitate public access to lawyers by placing this information on its Web site (see ). * Revamped, in 2002, the rules governing the Rules for the Reporting of Opinions in Ohio to standardize the publication of opinions from the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals to increase public access and availability written opinions. * Began, in March 2004, broadcasting live all Supreme Court Oral Arguments on cable TV and on the Internet. The cable signal reaches more than 5 million homes across Ohio. Ohio's courts are among only a small number of courts in the United States that broadcast all arguments live. All cases are also archived on the Internet. * Put the Attorney Registration Database online in 2004 so citizens can access information about any Ohio attorney, including business address and phone number, date of birth, date of admission to practice, disciplinary history and CLE status. * Put the entire docket online in 2005, allowing anyone at any time to check the status of a case, learn about new filings, and locate counsel information. * Began, in 2006, the closed-captioning of all oral arguments to facilitate access by deaf and hard- of-hearing citizens and to enable public access to unofficial transcripts of all proceedings in a searchable database.

It is the second book to be both written and drawn by Albert Uderzo. The book describes Asterix's and Obelix's voyage to the Middle East. It is mainly inspired by James Bond films and biblical tales. Plot summary The book begins with Asterix and Obelix hunting wild boar until one boar leads them to a Roman patrol, which the Gauls vanquish while the boars escape. In Rome, Julius Caesar orders M. Devius Surreptitious, the head of M.I.VI, service, to send an agent to infiltrate the Gauls. This agent is a Gaulish-Roman druid known as Dubbelosix, who travels in a folding chariot full of secret devices. Dubbelosix and Surreptitius communicate via a carrier fly, who develops a crush for Dubbelosix. In the Gaulish village, Getafix is depressed because he has run out of rock oil, which he requires to make the magic potion enabling the Gaulish resistance to Rome. The following day, Getafix is cheered by the arrival of Ekonomikrisis the Phoenician merchant but suffers a stroke upon hearing that he forgot to bring rock oil. When Chief Vitalstatistix tells Asterix and Obelix to fetch another druid to treat him, they discover Dubbelosix, who successfully revives Getafix with an alcoholic tonic. Asterix determines to go with Obelix and Dogmatix to obtain rock oil from Mesopotamia; Dubbelosix insists on coming, and they set off on Ekonomikrisis' ship. Along the way, they defeat pirates and Roman warships, while Dubbelosix secretly corresponds with the Romans, to arrange a blockade. The Phoenician ship finally lands at Judea, where Asterix, Obelix, Dogmatix, and Dubbelosix disembark for Jerusalem, where some sympathetic traders help the Gauls to enter secretly, in spite of an attempt by Dubbelosix to alert the city guards. Leaving him behind, Asterix and Obelix make contact with Ekonomikrisis' supplier, Samson Alius, who directs them to Babylon as the Romans have destroyed rock oil supplies in Jerusalem. In the Syrian desert, Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix find themselves caught up in ongoing wars between the Sumerians, Akkadians, Hittites, Assyrians, and Medes, much to Asterix's frustration. In the ensuing arrow battles, their waterskin is pierced, but they find a source of rock oil in the ground and carry some back to Jerusalem in the repaired waterskin. There, the two Gauls capture Caesar's personal ship, as well as Surreptitious and Dubbelosix. Near the coast of Gaul, Dubbelosix seizes the waterskin of rock oil and, as he tries to force it open, Obelix leaps upon him, spilling the oil into the sea. Asterix has lost all hope, but when they come back to the village, they find the Gauls fighting Romans as merrily as ever, and learn Getafix has replaced the rock oil in his potion with beetroot juice. Out of dismay, Asterix has a stroke, but after being cured with the new potion, convinces Getafix to perform experiments before testing him. Thereafter, the Gauls send Dubbelosix and Surreptitius to Caesar in a gift-wrapped box. Caesar sends them to the Circus Maximus as punishment for failure, where they are covered in honey and chased by bees, with the lovesick carrier fly following behind. Notes * An audiobook of Asterix and the Black Gold adapted by Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge and narrated by William Rushton was released on Hodder and Stoughton's Hodder Children's Audio. * The character Dubbelosix is an obvious homage to Sean Connery, star of the early James Bond movies. Uderzo modelled him on the appearance of Connery at the time the book was being drawn. Dubbelosix uses many \\"ancient times\\" versions of the popular gadgets of the Bond movies. His name is a pun on \\"006\\" (i.e. \\"007\\") ‚Äî the \\"six\\" being required for the \\"-ix\\" suffix of all male Gaulish names in Asterix, and also reflecting the number of times Sean Connery portrayed the role of James Bond on screen, which at the time was six. * When attempting to cure Getafix, Dubbelosix administers \\"a grain spirit called Caledonian\\", which is explained as \\"Ancient Scotch\\". This is a pun referring to the drink and the people ‚Äî all the more so since Connery is Scottish himself. *The secret service run by Surreptitius is referred to as M.I.VI. \\"VI\\" is 6 in Roman numerals, and MI6 is the name of the British espionage service. * Surreptitius is a caricature of actor Bernard Blier and bears some resemblance to James Bond's early bosses M (played in the films by Bernard Lee and Robert Brown) * The scene where the papyrus bearing instructions self-destructs after being read is a reference to Mission: Impossible where messages destroyed themselves after being received. * Saul ben Ephishul (\\"So Beneficial\\"), the Jew who escorts Asterix and Obelix from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea is based on Asterix creator and writer Ren√© Goscinny (also of Jewish stock), who had died four years earlier. * Asterix's and Obelix's visit to Jerusalem is full of references to the Bible. For example, Economikrisis mentions on page 29 that they have arrived in \\"the promised land\\". Asterix and Obelix spend the night in a stable in Bethlehem, and Saul ben Ephishul mentions the story of David and Goliath and the Roman procurator ‚Äî known as \\"Pontius Pirate\\" (a reference to Pontius Pilate) ‚Äî is constantly washing his hands. * Pontius Pirate resembles French actor Jean Gabin. * In the desert, Asterix and Obelix run into several warrior groups from historical Mesopotamian cultures ‚Äî Sumerians, Assyrians, Hittites, Medes etc. ‚Äî who each greet them with a hail of arrows because they mistake them for their enemies. Incidentally, the cultures conquered each other in the reverse order to which they appear in the comic; i.e. the Medes conquered the Assyrians, the Akkadians conquered the Sumerians etc. Their presence is, however, anachronistic, as these cultures no longer existed in Roman times. The entire sequence is a reference to the later 20th century conflicts in the Middle East. * The Herodian Kingdom of Israel is anachronistically referred as Palestine ‚Äî this name came into use only in the 2nd century CE, whereas Asterix is set c. 50 BCE. * Near the end of the book when the rock oil is spilled into the sea, a seabird angrily shouts: \\"Oh no, don't tell me you are starting already!\\". This is a reference to oil spills, most notably the Amoco Cadiz which sank in 1978 in front of the coast of Brittany, where the home village of Asterix is located, according to the series. * The scene of Jerusalem is taken one on one from the Holyland hotel 2nd temple model as can be seen here in its original location (in a 3d view). This model has been moved to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. * The Jews are all depicted as Yemenite Jews, with dark skin and black eyes and beards, a tribute to Marc Chagall the famous painter whose painting of King David hangs at the Knesset (Israeli Parliament). * Uderzo includes several small references to Jewish traditions. * The Gauls leave Jerusalem through the Lions' Gate, which, while drawn very accurately, was in fact built more than 1200 years after the timeline of the Asterix comic. The lions (e.g. cheetahs) carved in the stones are the imperial Symbol of Baibars, and the gate with the 'lions', incorporated into Sultan Suleiman's outer wall, still stands today. * Several characters in the story comment on the uselessness and nastiness of rock oil, wondering why anybody would want it; this starkly contrasts the dependence on petroleum which marks our own time. * In the Norwegian translation, the new magic potion ingredient that replaced rock oil is not identified.

It shows the Highlanders still wearing the plaids they normally set aside before battle. They would fire a volley, then run full tilt at the enemy, brandishing their weapons and wearing only their shirts. The Highland charge was a battlefield shock tactic used by the clans of the Scottish Highlands which incorporated the use of firearms. Historical development Targe and broadsword from the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion Prior to the 17th century, Highlanders fought in tight formations, led by a heavily armed warrior elite who carried heavy battle axes or claymores (two-handed swords whose name comes from the Scottish Gaelic claidheamh m√≤r \\"great sword\\"). However, with the introduction of muskets and cannon, such formations became vulnerable. As a result, in the 17th century, Highlander warriors developed a lighter, one-handed basket-hilted broadsword that protected the hand. This was generally used with a shield or targe strapped to the weak arm and a dirk or biotag \\"long knife\\" held in the other hand. The Scottish and Irish warrior Alasdair Mac Colla is sometimes credited with inventing the Highland charge during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms to meet a particular set of battlefield challenges.Hill (1999), pp. 214‚Äì5 It was initially known as the Irish charge, due to it first being implemented in Ireland, by Montrose's Irish brigade, before the Irish used it in Scotland again under Montrose.The use of the charge greatly resembled older Celtic fighting styles of battle in which one side would rush at the other in an attempt to break the line of battle. The charge The charge required a high degree of commitment as the men were rushing into musket range and would suffer casualties from at least one volley. Speed was essential, so the Highlanders preferred to employ the charge downhill and over firm ground; they removed clothing from their lower body for the same reason. They ran forward in clusters of a dozen (often blood relatives) which formed a larger wedge shaped formation. Once in effective musket range (60 yards) those with firearms would shoot; gun-smoke from this mass discharge having obscured enemies' aim, the Highlanders obtained further protection from the expected return volley from the opposing force by crouching low to the ground immediately after firing. Then, firearms were dropped and edged weapons drawn, whereupon the men made the final rush on the enemy line with a Gaelic battle cry. On reaching striking distance the Highlander would attempt to take the opponent's sword or bayonet point on his targe while lunging in low to deliver an upward thrust to his enemy's torso. =Bayonet technology and the charge= Before the adoption of ring attachments for bayonets, the attachment consisted of a plug inserted into the barrel, which meant a musket could not be fired or reloaded with a fixed bayonet. During their charge Highlanders made a relatively instant transition from firearms to swords as they swiftly closed with the opposing force. Those enemy soldiers with plug attachments (some carried a pike) had only moments to fix bayonets while under psychological pressure from the onrushing Highlanders brandishing swords and roaring their war cries. At the Battle of Killiecrankie Lowland Scots who were veterans of the Dutch wars were overwhelmed by Highlanders of clan Cameron; the Highlanders secured a complete victory by a charge which killed 2000 redcoats for the loss of 800 Highlanders.Ricketts, Howard, Firearms (London, 1965)Hill, James Michael, Celtic warfare, 1595‚Äì1763 (2003),J. DonaldCarlton, Charles (1994), Going to the wars: the experience of the British civil wars, 1638‚Äì1651 page 135 The ring bayonet reduced the effectiveness of the Highland charge, but it remained an example of shock tactics, with the key factor being psychological; rather than being an attempt to cut through a solid enemy line, the charge aimed at causing some enemy troops in the opposing line to break ranks before contact, thereby leaving openings which could be exploited to 'roll up' the rest.Highland Clansman 1689‚Äì1746 By Stuart Reid,p. 20-26 This happened at the Battle of Tippermuir and the Battle of Falkirk Muir. One of the least successful uses of the Highland charge was in 1746 during the final confrontation of the Jacobite rising of 1745, the Battle of Culloden. The battle pitted the Jacobite forces of Charles Edward Stuart against an army commanded by Prince William, Duke of Cumberland loyal to the British government. The under-nourished and unpaid Jacobite force was badly outnumbered and outgunned by well-trained regular troops who maintained discipline when charged.Hill, James Michael, Celtic warfare, 1595‚Äì1763 (2003),J. Donald, page 135 =Culloden= To the dismay of his military advisors, Charles Edward Stuart insisted on offering battle to the pursuing army of Cumberland on the open moorland of Culloden with the intention of fighting defensively, a decision that most historians have seen as playing into the hands of the government forces. The Jacobites failed to take advantage of the opportunity of attacking before the enemy had positioned their artillery and were ready for action. Cumberland's artillery bombarded the Jacobite army, which was stationary and exposed, until up to a third of Charles's men were dispersed or made casualties (including a groom decapitated while holding Charles Edward's horse). At this point ‚Äì and without orders from the by now unnerved Jacobite command ‚Äì Clan Mackintosh in the centre of the Jacobite line began to charge. Donald Cameron of Lochiel led the Camerons to join them and some other clans followed in a spontaneous, uncoordinated and disorganized charge in which many failed to use their firearms. Despite canister shot and volleys, the charge reached ‚Äì and in places broke through ‚Äì the Government front line (though many Highlanders were without targes to protect from bayonets). However, Coehorn mortar shelling and devastating enfilade musket fire from the deeply echeloned government forces killed those who had made a breakthrough, while the others, after suffering heavy casualties, fell back in a retreat that quickly became a rout.Black, Jeremy (1999) Britain as a military power 1688‚Äì1815 ‚Äì page 28Black, Jeremy, Culloden and the '45(1990)Black, Jeremy (2007), A military history of Britain: from 1775 to the present -page 39Allison, Hugh G.,(2007),Culloden Tales: Stories from Scotland's Most Famous Battlefield, Mainstream Publishing =Moore's Creek Bridge= The Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge, fought in 1776 in North Carolina and one of the earliest battles of the American Revolution, has been called the \\"last Scottish Highland broadsword charge.\\" It was fought between a collection of North Carolina rebels and a loyalist force mainly composed of emigrant Scottish Highlanders who had settled around the Cape Fear area. During the battle, the Highlanders attempted to charge the rebels with their broadswords, but were gunned down due to the superior positions and equipment of the opposing side. At least 30 of the Scottish loyalists were killed, and many more were taken prisoner by the victorious rebels, who had by contrast lost only two men. The battle has been cited as one of the earliest major Patriot victories in the War of American Independence.

Of the total surface area of the larger lake, belongs to North Macedonia, to Albania and to Greece. They are the highest tectonic lakes in the Balkans, standing at an elevation of 853 m (2,798 ft). The Great Prespa Lake (, Prespansko Ezero, , , Meg√°li Pr√©spa) is divided between North Macedonia, Albania, and Greece. The Little Prespa LakeKapka Kassabova, To the Lake, Granta 2020, map 1 gives simply Lake Prespa and Little Prespa, not Great and Small Prespa (Greek: ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒÆ Œ†œÅŒ≠œÉœÄŒ±, Mikri Prespa; Albanian: Prespa e Vog√´l; Macedonian: –ú–∞–ª–æ –ü—Ä–µ—Å–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ –ï–∑–µ—Ä–æ) is shared only between Greece ( drainage area; surface area) and Albania ( drainage area; surface area). The area contains three National Parks located in Albania (Prespa National Park), Greece, and North Macedonia respectively. The largest town in the Prespa Lakes region is Resen in North Macedonia. In 2014, the Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Reserve between Albania and North Macedonia was added to UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves.Thirteen sites added to UNESCO‚Äôs World Network of Biosphere Reserves ‚Äì UNESCO History Topographic map of Lake Prespa and Lake Ohrid. Spongilla prespensis is endemic to Lake Prespa In Classical times, the Prespa region formed part of ancient L√Ωnkos (ŒõœçŒ≥Œ∫ŒøœÇ), and the lakes were called Little and Great Brygeis. In the 10th century, the Tsar Samuil built the fortress and church of St. Achillius on an island called Agios Achillios in the Small Prespa Lake, on the Greek side of the border. The biggest island in the Great Prespa Lake, within North Macedonia, is called Golem Grad (\\"Large Town\\"), and Snake Island (Zmiski Ostrov). The other island Mal Grad (\\"Small Town\\", in Albania) is the site of a ruined 14th century monastery dedicated to St. Peter. Today, both islands are uninhabited. Because Great Prespa Lake sits in limestone country about 150m above Lake Ohrid, which lies only about (6 miles) to the west, the only outlets for its waters are through underground channels in the karst and emerge from springs which feed streams running into Lake Ohrid.Thomas Wilke, Risto V√§inol√§, Frank Riedel (2009), Patterns and Processes of Speciation in Ancient Lakes: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Berlin, Germany, September 4‚Äì8, 2006 (Developments in Hydrobiology), p. 107, Springer, For many years, the Greek part of the Prespa Lakes region was an underpopulated, military sensitive area which required special permission for outsiders to visit. It saw fierce fighting during the Greek Civil War and much of the local population subsequently emigrated to escape endemic poverty and political strife. The region remained little developed until the 1970s, when it began to be promoted as a tourist destination. With an abundance of rare fauna and flora, the area was declared a Transnational Park in 2000. In 1999 the Society for the Protection of Prespa received the Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award for its conservation efforts regarding the Lake Prespa Ramsar site, and was eventually included on 3 July 2013. In 2018, Great Prespa Lake was the setting for the signing of the Prespa Agreement, intended to resolve the Macedonia naming dispute by renaming the Republic of Macedonia to North Macedonia.. The agreement was signed on 17 June 2018 in a high-level ceremony at the Greek border village of Psarades on the lake, by the two foreign ministers Nikola Dimitrov (of the Republic of Macedonia) and Nikos Kotzias (of Greece) and in the presence of the respective prime ministers, Zoran Zaev and Alexis Tsipras. After the ceremony, Tsipras and Zaev crossed over the border to North Macedonia's side of the lake for lunch at the village of Ote≈°evo, in a highly symbolic move that marked the first time a Greek Prime Minister ever entered the Republic of Macedonia since it declared independence in 1991. Wildlife Only 11 native fish species are known from the lake, but 9 of these are endemic: Alburnoides prespensis, Alburnus belvica, Barbus prespensis, Chondrostoma prespense, Cobitis meridionalis, Pelasgus prespensis, Rutilus prespensis, Salmo peristericus and Squalius prespensis.Talevski, Milosevic, Maric, Petrovic, Talevska and Talevska (2009).

The majority of foreign tourism has been clustered around the sister lake, Ohrid, where there are abundant overnight accommodations, restaurants and a lively town center in the summer months. Lake Prespa has subsequently remained somewhat isolated and pastoral, bringing its own special attraction in current times. The area remains pristine, without the hustle and bustle of a tourist town and a distinct lack of concrete and pollution which usually comes with developing tourism. Waterfront developments with sophisticated cafes serving food and drinks such as \\"Connect Beach\\" in the village of Slivnica, however, are providing a way for visitors to spend the day on the lake in luxury, without impacting on the environment. Companies such Prespa Panorama based in North Macedonia are leading the development of overnight lodging for the region with a concept of low environmental impact, low volume accommodations in the region. The municipality of Resen has begun construction of a paved walking and biking path that will link the individual villages providing access for a walking or biking tour of the numerous villages that are scattered around the lake. The completed concept will allow individuals to explore the entire south western corner of North Macedonia including Pelister and Galicica, two of the most beautiful and scenic mountain peaks of the region on foot or by bicycle. A descent from Galicica on the western face brings the cyclist or hiker down to the most scenic part of Lake Ohrid, which is separated from Lake Prespa by its massif. Once on the Lake Ohrid side, the springs where the waters of Lake Prespa emerge from under the mountain and drain into Lake Ohrid can be enjoyed. Sources * \\"Prespa, Lake\\".

The bridge connects West Dunbartonshire with Renfrewshire and can be used by all types of motor vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. As well as crossing the Clyde, the bridge also crosses the Forth and Clyde Canal and the North Clyde railway line. A small part of Kilpatrick railway station is situated underneath the bridge at the north side. The bridge is part of the A898 road.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2013/167/pdfs/ssi_20130167_en.pdf On completion the bridge replaced the Erskine to Old Kilpatrick ferry service. Construction View of the underside of the bridge The bridge was designed by Dr William Brown (1928‚Äì2005), a structural engineer and bridge designer who specialised in suspension bridges. He was one of the principal designers at Freeman Fox & Partners (now Hyder Consulting) from 1956-85. Supervising engineer on the project was Dr Oleg Kerensky and the architect on site was R.E. Slater. There were several firms who constructed the bridge between 1967-71. The structural engineering was done by Freeman Fox & Partners and the steel fabrication was completed by Fairfields-Mabey. W.A. Fairhurst and Partners (now Fairhurst) designed and oversaw construction of the concrete piers and foundations. Christiani & Nielsen, Lehane Mackenzie and Shand Ltd were the contractors for the foundations and piers. The steel cable supplier was Bridon International. Force Technology were responsible for wind tunnel testing of the bridge. Steel was used to construct the deck and pylons and the piers are made from concrete. The road surface is mastic asphalt and consists of a two-lane dual carriageway and cycle/footpaths on each side. It has a main span and two approach spans. The width of the road deck is . Pylon height is high. The total length of the bridge including approaches is . The clearance of the bridge is . The weight of the steel is 11,700 tonnes. of galvanised wire with a breaking load of 500 tonnes were used during construction. The bridge has 15 spans in total and rests on 14 diamond shaped piers which have been designed to allow air to circulate freely around them. The deck and piers have been designed to flex with temperature changes. In the event of the bridge traffic numbers increasing the cycle tracks can be configured to include a third lane. There are 4 water mains pipes and 2 gas pipes running the full length of the underside of the bridge. It is the only bridge in Scotland with single cables over central main supports and was in this respect a precursor of the Millau Viaduct in France. At the time of building it was the longest bridge of its type in the world. The bridge cost including approaches was ¬£10.5million. HRH Princess Anne opened the bridge on 2 July 1971. The ceremonial plaque of the opening can be seen on the railings of the western footpath, at the centre of the main span. Whilst the bridge was being constructed, the West Gate Bridge in Australia also designed by Freeman Fox & Partners, collapsed. An investigation published on 14 July 1971 found faults in the design. The reason for collapse was a difference in camber between 2 girders on the west span. The Erskine Bridge had already opened but needed further stiffening to meet new standards established due to the collapse of the West Gate Bridge. The bridge operates an overload weight detection system which logs vehicles axle weights. The weigh in motion system uses electric sensors and an ANPR camera. There is also a camera that takes photos of the vehicle from side-on which can identify the haulage company at fault. The system can also check if HGV axles are lifted when they should not be and is operational 24 hours a day. Reports can be printed for overweight vehicles. Geography Map of the Erskine Bridge area The bridge itself is the A898 road and its short approach from the south is the M898 motorway which is a spur from the M8 motorway. The bridge connects Erskine in Renfrewshire on the south side to the A82 (Great Western Road) at Old Kilpatrick in West Dunbartonshire on the northern side. The bridge is set at a high level to allow the passage of shipping beneath. This offers views of Erskine, Mar Hall, Erskine Hospital, Erskine Bridge Hotel, Dumbarton, River Clyde, Glasgow Airport and the Kilpatrick Hills. The area around the bridge has some historical significance as there have been various pieces of Roman artifacts found. Historical items found at the site include Roman coins known as sestertius and a crannog which is an artificial island. The bridge is the most downstream of all the Clyde bridges and is the last point at which the estuary can be crossed by road. Its main function is to divert traffic away from Glasgow and the urban stretches of the A82 which run through the city's West End and outer suburbs. The location of the bridge means that the bridge is used by tourist traffic from Glasgow International Airport bound for Loch Lomond and the north west Highlands. Toll bridge View of the toll booths at the bridge The bridge was a toll bridge until 31 March 2006. Apcoa Parking UK Ltd collected tolls on the bridge from June 1992. The tolling booths were situated at the south side of the bridge and were constructed by Culford Art Metal. On 1 March 2006 the Transport Minister published a Tolls Suspension Order following an announcement that the tolling was to cease after 31 March 2006. The bridge had briefly been free of charge before - in 2001 an oversight caused the legislative order enforcing the toll to lapse and drivers crossed free until the new legislation was enforced. At this point the contract for toll collection was put out to tender and was re-awarded to Apcoa from 1 April 2002. The contract for toll collection expired on 31 March 2006. Toll charges from the beginning of the 1992-93 accounting period tolls had been a flat rate of 60p on all vehicles, except motorcycles and exempt categories. A discount of 10% was available to those purchasing 50 pre-paid crossing vouchers. Fire and police vehicles, ambulances, maintenance vehicles, and vehicles displaying disabled badges were exempt. The bridge was one of only three toll bridges left in Scotland when the tolls were abolished. The others were the Forth Road Bridge and the Tay Road Bridge. The tolls were abolished on those bridges on 11 February 2008. The bridge had collected ¬£72 million in tolls by 2001 and collected ¬£5.676m in the last operating year. Its current traffic levels are estimated at 35,000 vehicles per day and because of this the bridge was considered something of a white elephant given its elaborate design yet relatively low traffic levels compared to the congested Kingston Bridge further upstream. In the last accounting period between 1 April 2006 - 2 July 2006 whilst the tolls were free the bridge saw an increase in traffic on the previous year by 27.33%. The bridge is now part of the trunk road network of Scotland and is the responsibility of Transport Scotland. Events Waverley paddle steamer sailing under the bridge There have been two known births on the bridge. The first was a boy who was born 19 September 1990. He was subsequently named Oliver Erskine Edwards in homage to the bridge. A second baby, Kiera Sarah-Marie McFettridge was born in an ambulance on the bridge on 18 January 2011. The bridge has been used once by a group of base jumpers in August 2010. A Royal Navy Westland Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet, coastguard teams and officers from Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service were all called out to the bridge following the incident. An oil rig called the Texaco Captain collided with the road deck on 4 August 1996 resulting in the closure of the bridge. The oil rig was constructed upstream at Clydebank before being towed down the River Clyde. The bridge reopened to pedestrians and cyclists on 22 August 1996. This was followed by cars and motorcycles on 30 August 1996 and was opened again to all vehicles including heavy goods vehicles on 22 December 1996. Repairs to the bridge cost ¬£3.6 million with a further ¬£700,000 in lost revenue from tolls. The bridge has also been the subject of a murder investigation and ensuing court case after parts of a man's dismembered body were found underneath the bridge in late 2001. A man was subsequently arrested and convicted for this crime. Suicides The bridge is one of Scotland's most notorious suicide spots: estimates suggest that more than fifteen people commit suicide there each year. This has led to the Samaritans charity placing signs at each path leading onto the bridge and also within four public telephone boxes that are situated on the twin footpaths running adjacent to the roadway on either side of the river. There are also normal SOS phones as seen on motorways nationwide. The bridge was brought into the media spotlight again after the death of two teenage girls who absconded from a nearby secure unit. In September 2011, work started to install suicide barriers along the length of the bridge to prevent future suicide attempts. Installation of the new barriers was completed by Amey Highways at a cost of ¬£3.5 million. The vehicle barriers are also being upgraded. The new barriers being installed are H4a High Containment Vehicle Barriers. These works will also see the towers and the suspension cables being re-painted. Stage one of this upgrade started on 15 July 2013 and is scheduled to last for 12 months. Highway Barrier Solutions are undertaking the upgrade which will cost ¬£6 million and whilst ongoing the traffic is being monitored by Bluetooth technology. There are detectors on the bridge entry points which feed live traffic reports to the Traffic Scotland website.

It began operating on December 19, 1984. The plant, which is the state's only commercial nuclear unit, has one 1,190-megawatt Westinghouse four-loop pressurized water reactor and a General Electric turbine-generator. It is owned by the Ameren Corporation and operated by subsidiary Ameren Missouri. Surrounding population The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. The 2010 population within of Callaway was 10,092, an increase of 3.8 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 population within was 546,292, an increase of 15.0 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Fulton (11 miles to city center), Jefferson City (26 miles to city center), and Columbia (32 miles to city center). In 2014, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission tests found contaminated ground water near the site.  Power output  According to Ameren, Callaway produces about 19 percent of Ameren Missouri's power. In 2001, Callaway set a plant record by producing 101.1 percent of its rated electrical output, ranking it among the world's top reactors, according to the Energy Information Administration. The plant produces 1,279 electrical megawatts (MWe) of net power.https://www.ameren.com/callaway/ADC_PlantProfile.asp It has run continuously for over 500 days between refuelings, one of 26 U.S. reactors to do so. On November 19, 2005, its workers finished replacing all four steam generators in 63 days, 13 hours, a world record for a four-loop plant.  Cooling tower  Callaway Nuclear Generating Station at sunrise in 2020, with cooling tower visible at left The cooling tower at Callaway is tall. It is 430 feet wide at the base, and is constructed from reinforced concrete. It cools about of water per minute when the plant is operating at full capacity; about of water per minute are lost out the top from evaporation.https://www.ameren.com/callaway/ADC_FactsandFigures.asp Another of water are sent to the Missouri River as \\"blowdown\\" to flush solids from the cooling tower basin. All water lost through evaporation or blowdown is replaced with water from the river, located five miles from the plant. The temperature of the water going into the cooling tower is , and the tower cools it to . The tower is designed such that if it were to somehow topple over completely intact, it would not damage any of the critical plant structures. Proposed Unit 2 and cancellation  On July 28, 2008, Ameren Missouri applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) to build a 1,600-MW Areva Evolutionary Power Reactor. \\"Given projections for a nearly 30 percent increase in demand for power in Missouri in the next two decades, we believe we will need to build a large generating plant to be on line in the 2018‚Äì2020 timeframe,\\" wrote Thomas R. Voss, the company's president and chief executive officer. In April 2009, the proposal was cancelled. One stumbling block was a law that forbids utilities to charge customers for the interest accrued on a construction loan before a new plant produces electricity. The new nuclear reactor would have cost at least $6 billion.Nuke plant is, well, nuked. Not gonna happenTerry Ganey. AmerenUE pulls plug on project Columbia Daily Tribune, April 23, 2009. In April 2012, Ameren Missouri and Westinghouse Electric Company announced their intent to seek federal funding for a new generation of nuclear reactors to be installed at the Callaway site. The U.S. Department of Energy could provide up to $452 million in research and development funds to Westinghouse. The new reactors would be smaller and, the companies claimed, safer in design than any currently operating. Ameren Missouri would apply to license up five of the 225-megawatt reactors at the Callaway site, more than doubling its current electrical output. In August 2015, a month after Ameren had announced plans to build solar energy plants in Missouri, all plans to expand nuclear-powered electricity generation at the site were scrapped.http://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric- power/louisville-kentucky/ameren-decision-to-scrap-plans-for-new- missouri-21898870 Seismic risk In August 2010, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimated that the annual chance that an earthquake might damage the core at Callaway was 1 in 500,000,Bill Dedman, \\"What are the odds?

It is surrounded by the Municipality of Swan Valley West in the Swan River Valley region. Swan River acts as the hub to the surrounding communities of Minitonas, Benito, Bowsman, Birch River, and the other communities in the valley. As of 2016, Swan River was Manitoba's 16th largest in population, which was 4,014 as of the 2016 Canadian Census according to Statistics Canada,Census Profile, 2016 Census Swan River, Town [Census subdivision, Manitoba and Division No. 20, Census division [Census division], Manitoba] with an additional 2,829 people living in the surrounding rural municipality of Swan River. History Located in a valley between the Duck Mountains and the Porcupine Hills, the town of Swan River is close to the Saskatchewan boundary in west-central Manitoba. The town is situated along the Swan River which flows into Swan Lake, to the north-east. Swan Lake is believed to be named for the swans that once frequented the lake, but are nowadays only seasonal visitors. Henry Kelsey became the first European explorer to visit the area in 1690. The name of the lake is first noted on a map created by Peter Fidler in 1795 and again on a French map in 1802 (as L du Cigne). The first permanent European settlement dates back to 1770, when fur traders from both the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company established outposts along the Swan River where they bought and sold goods to local Cree peoples by way of birch bark canoes. In 1876, the musical band of the North-West Mounted Police, the forerunner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, made its debut in what was later to become Swan River. The instruments used in the band were purchased by the 20 officers in the band and shipped from Winnipeg by dog sled. The first pioneers arrived in the Swan Valley through the Duck Mountains in 1897 and quickly developed the farming potential of the area. The proposed construction of a line of the Canadian Northern Railway was announced in 1898 and the town was founded in 1900, though it was little more than a post office at the time. Swan River was officially incorporated as a town in 1908. Geology The Swan River Valley is not truly a river valley, but is instead a western extension of the Manitoba lowlands into the Manitoba Escarpment. The Valley is surrounded by escarpment features on three sides: the Duck Mountains to the south; the Porcupine Hills to the north; and Thunder Hill to the west. To the east is Lake Winnipegosis, which is a modern remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz, a lake that filled the valley after the last ice age (the valley was then a bay on the western shore of the lake). Valley soils are formed from a mixture of glacial till and lacustrine clay. Sandy beach ridges (marking the western shore of Lake Agassiz at various times) lie throughout the area: a prominent beach ridge lies under the town's golf course, just west of town. Valley soils are typically very fertile and deep, and are the area's greatest natural resource. But they also have a high calcium carbonate content and an alkaline pH, which limits their productivity in some crops (for example, blueberries). The underlying bedrock is composed of Cretaceous shales, and, below that, sandstone, which overlie deeper deposits of Devonian limestone, which in turn overlie Precambrian granite. Ecology The Valley is near the southern limit of the boreal forest in its transition zone to aspen parkland. Valley trees include white spruce, black spruce, tamarack larch, balsam fir, jack pine, quaking aspen, balsam poplar, and paper birch. Most of the forest has been cleared from the flat valley bottom for agricultural purposes, but the surrounding hills are still heavily forested, and are designated as forest reserves. Numerous peaty bogs and wetlands are present in the area, including hundreds of oxbow lakes of the meandering Swan and Woody rivers. The surrounding hills have many lakes, as does the lower lake bottom land near the eastern edge of the valley. Climate The climate of west-central Manitoba features extreme seasonal variation, with winter temperatures below and summer temperatures above not uncommon. The town therefore has very distinct seasons. Snow usually covers the ground from early November to early April, and only two Christmases have been recorded that have not been \\"white\\" (snow-covered) since such records have been kept. The transition from winter to spring to summer is rapid, with the snow of late March turning to the full green of summer by mid-May. The onset of autumn, then winter, is equally rapid, as daytime high temperatures above are common in late September, while temperatures above freezing are rare by early November, only seven weeks later. Summer, although short, is pleasant and very green, owing to the fertility of local soils and adequate rainfall. Most precipitation falls as rain in the summer - usually in brief thunderstorms - or in less violent but more protracted snow or rainshowers in spring and fall. Little precipitation falls in winter because the air is then too cold to hold significant amounts of moisture. However, because the temperature rarely goes above the melting point of water in winter, what precipitation that does fall falls as snow, and accumulates on the ground, building to a depth of about before finally starting to melt in March. Economy The economic base of the town lies in agriculture and forestry along with support industries for same. Almost fifty percent of the surrounding area is under cultivation, most of which is seeded to cereal grain, oilseeds, and other speciality crops. Wheat, rye, barley, oats, flax, and rapeseed are the primary grain crops, while other commercial crops include potatoes and strawberries. There are also many mixed farms producing cattle, pigs, and farm-raised wild animals. Softwood lumber trees (primarily white spruce) are cut from the surrounding forests, and milled at Spruce Products Ltd. Also, east of Swan River in the Rural Municipality of Minitonas, is located a mill specializing in the production of oriented strand board from aspen and balsam poplar. It is owned by Louisiana-Pacific. Other major industries of the town are health care, retail services, manufacturing, and tourism. Services The Town of Swan River acts as a hub for an area of approximately 7,000 people. =Health care= The primary healthcare centre in the Swan River Valley is the Swan Valley Health Centre, located in downtown Swan River. The 52 acute-care bed facility was opened in 2005 to replace the old Swan River Valley Hospital, which closed in 2001. Between 2001-2005, the Swan River Valley Hospital was located in a temporary structure adjacent to the old hospital. Services at the hospital include in-patient medical/surgical services, out-patient services, mental health services, and occupational therapy. The hospital is also home to the only emergency department in the Swan River Valley. =Retail= The Town of Swan River is home to a number of local, national, and international retailers and businesses.

Until recently, PTH 10 and PTH 83 came directly into Swan River, with the intersection located near the town's southwest corner. The completion of a new bypass changed the highway to start on the east side of Swan River. PTH 83 continues south to the Canada‚ÄìUS border near Westhope, North Dakota. It then continues south as U.S. Route 83 to the Mexican border near Brownsville, Texas, making it the longest continuously numbered north-south highway in North America with a combined distance is . =Airport= Swan River Airport has no scheduled flights and is used by charter services, emergency flights and private pilots.

The Times Thursday, 7 June 1973; pg. 21; Issue 58802 He is best remembered for his long running BBC Radio programme, The Clitheroe Kid (1956‚Äì72). Early years Jimmy Clitheroe was born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, England on Christmas Eve 1921 at 58 Wilkin Street (now called Highfield Road), to weavers Emma Pye and James Robert Clitheroe, who had married in 1918. He was born at his maternal grandparents' home. His childhood was spent in the mill village of Blacko, near Nelson, living at 14 Spout Houses, a row of terrace houses below Blacko Tower. He attended the Council School up to the age of 12, when he transferred to Barrowford Board School for his final two years (in an era when education was compulsory only up to the age of 14). An only child, he was named after his mother's younger brother, James Robinson Pye, who had been born in Clitheroe in 1894 and was killed in action in the First World War. According to newspapers in 1938, at the age of 16 he was 3 ft 6¬Ω ins. His father was over 6 ft tall but Jimmy never grew any taller than 4 ft 2in ‚Äî about average for an eight or nine year old boy. His small size was thought to be caused by his thyroid gland being damaged at birth during a forceps delivery and, until later life, he could easily pass for an 11-year- old, which was the character he played on stage, in his early films, and on radio and television. Career Being unable to work in the weaving sheds with his parents, as he was too short to reach the looms, Clitheroe worked for a time in a bakery in Nelson, but was also touring the variety theatres in Yorkshire and Lancashire from 1937 as a boy accordionist, and also played the xylophone and saxophone. Later, he bought a caravan to live in whilst touring the various towns in whose theatres he appeared. He made his first pantomime appearance in 1938, alongside the bumptious \\"Two Ton\\" Tessie O'Shea. In pantomime he was usually cast as Buttons, Tom Thumb, or Wishee Washee. He moved into films from 1940 (thanks to a chance meeting with top of the bill stars Arthur Lucan and Kitty McShane) and radio from 1954 (initially on the BBC's regional Home Service North, and subsequently on the nationwide BBC Light Programme, then television (with ITV, produced by ABC Television in their Manchester studios) from 1963. During the 1940s, Clitheroe appeared in pantomime and summer season dates, and in films, with stars of the day including Arthur Lucan (as Old Mother Riley), George Formby, Vera Lynn, and Frank Randle.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. In 1959, Clitheroe was invited to take part in the Royal Command variety show, in the presence of the Queen Mother. His long-running radio programme on the BBC, The Clitheroe Kid, was broadcast from 1956 until August 1972. His catchphrase was \\"Don't some mothers 'ave 'em!\\" Two versions of the radio series were produced for television on the ITV network: That's My Boy! (which ran for seven episodes in 1963), and Just Jimmy (which ran for 5 years, between 1964‚Äì68). Mollie Sugden, who had worked with Clitheroe in his stage shows, played his mother in the latter series. Clitheroe owned a bookmaker's shop on Springfield Road, Blackpool, and the Fernhill Hotel at Preesall. He appeared on the Blackpool stage for many years, from 1936 until 1971. In September 1972 The Clitheroe Kid was cancelled by the BBC after a 16-year run. Personal life From 1960 onwards, Clitheroe lived with his mother, to whom he was devoted, in a bungalow, 118 Bispham Road in Blackpool. His father had died on 9 January 1951, from complications arising from injuries sustained in the First World War. Jimmy was godfather to co-star Diana Day's daughter. She named her son James after him. Clitheroe himself never married. For many years he drove a Mercedes car, with blocks on the pedals so that his feet could reach them. Appearing to be an underage driver, he could seldom complete a journey without attracting the attention of the police. Illness and death On 30 March 1973, Clitheroe collapsed in his hotel room in Plymouth, while touring in a variety show, and spent four days in hospital. Jimmy Clitheroe died on 6 June 1973 from an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, combined with seven brandies, on the day of his mother's funeral. He was found unconscious in bed by relatives, and died later that day in hospital in Blackpool. His mother had died five days before, aged 84. His funeral was held at Carleton Crematorium, Blackpool, on 11 June 1973, where for many years he was commemorated by a plaque attached to memorial tree Number 3.

Despite its name, the plant does not resemble the gooseberry, except for the acidity of its fruits. It tastes sour and tart. Description Sapling Phyllanthus acidus is an intermediary between a shrub and tree, reaching 2 to 9 m (6¬Ω to 30 ft) high. The tree's dense and bushy crown is composed of thickish, tough main branches, at the end of which are clusters of deciduous, greenish, 15-to-30-cm long branchlets. The branchlets bear alternate leaves that are ovate or lanceolate in form, with short petioles and pointed ends. The leaves are 2-7.5 cm long and thin, they are green and smooth on the upperside and blue-green on the underside. In general, the Otaheite gooseberry tree very much looks like the bilimbi tree. Leaves The flowers can be male, female or hermaphrodite. They are small and pinkish and appear in clusters in 5-to-12.5-cm long panicles. Flowers are formed at leafless parts of the main branches, at the upper part of the tree. The fruits are numerous, oblate, with 6 to 8 ribs, and densely clustered. They are pale yellow or white, waxy, crisp and juicy, and very sour. 4 to 6 seeds are contained in a stone at the center of each fruit. Tree in greenhouse Origin and distribution This tropical or subtropical species is found throughout Asia and also in the Caribbean region, Central and South America. While its origin is uncertain, the species may have originated in Madagascar. It was found in other parts of South Asia early; according to Eduardo Quisumbing, it was brought to the Philippines in prehistoric times. It spread across the Indian Ocean to R√©union and Mauritius and crossed the Pacific to Hawaii. It expanded to the Caribbean in 1793, when William Bligh carried the plant from Timor to Jamaica. The tree is common in Guam, Micronesia (where it is called ceremai or cerama), South Vietnam (called ch√πm ru·ªôt), Laos, northern Peninsular Malaysia (called cerme and cermai), India (called - (Tamil-‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç-[‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡Øà ‡Æ®‡ØÜ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç], chalmeri, harpharoi, [Nellikai in kannada], Laheri (Kokborok)Harfi, Arunellikai, Abazhanga, Nellipuli, Usiri(in Telugu-‡∞â‡∞∏‡∞ø‡∞∞‡∞ø), Khatamada, Arinelli, Bimbool, Arinellika, Kiru Nerle, Mara Nelli, Amla, Gihori (Manipuri), N≈ç·πõa(Bengali-‡¶®‡ßã‡¶°‡¶º) and rosavale (in konkani language) in goa) and Bangladesh.

It can be cultivated in a variety of ways‚Äîbudding, cutting and air-layering‚Äîin addition to the usual seed growth. The tree is cultivated for its ornamental value, but also for food and medicinal purposes. While it produces some fruit throughout the year, it is mainly harvested in January except in South India, where it bears crops in April‚ÄìMay and again in August‚ÄìSeptember. As the fruit does not soften when ripe, it is harvested when the fruit begins to drop. Various parts of the plant are used for food. In Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, the cooked leaves are eaten. While the fruit is eaten fresh, and is sometimes used as flavoring for other dishes in Indonesia, it is generally regarded as too tart to eat by itself in its natural form and is processed further. It is candied in sugar or pickled in salt, used in chutney, relish or preserves. In the Philippines, it is used to make vinegar as well as eaten raw, soaked in salt or vinegar-salt solution and sold along the roadside. It is candied as well, usually stored in jars with syrup. They make these into a syrup in Malaysia. Liberally sugared, it is also used to make fruit juice. In Thailand it is used as an ingredient to make Som tam, to make pickled, boil in syrup (Ma-Yom Chuam). The plant is also used medicinally. The peppered leaves are used to make a poultice to treat sciatica, lumbago and rheumatism (but have been observed to cause low blood pressure when combined with nitrates), while the seeds are used as a cathartic and the root, if prepared with care, as a purgative. The syrup is used to medicate the stomach, and in India the fruit is eaten as a blood-enhancer for the liver. P. acidus contains 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, adenosine, kaempferol and hypogallic acid. While the wood is strong and durable if properly treated, the tree is not large and is rarely harvested for wood. In India, the root bark is sometimes used for tanning.

It tells the story of Jennifer Tate, a 21-year-old woman searching for her boyfriend through a series of demonic realms. As the story develops, more is revealed about Jen's past and her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as the nature of the demon worlds. In May 2016, the game was made available for the PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Network with slightly improved graphics and trophy support. Gameplay In Primal, the player can control either Jen or Scree as they navigate the realms of Oblivion. As the game progresses, newer demonic forms are obtained, which prove invaluable in solving various puzzles and combat. Control can be switched between Jen and Scree at any time in game. When in control of one, the other will be operated by AI, performing various functions depending on the situation. During play, the characters can interact with one another, performing actions such as asking questions, or siphoning energy. When in control of Jen, the player may transform into one of four demonic forms for various purposes, depending on the situation (provided the forms are unlocked). When in a demon form, Jen experiences a boost in attack, defense, speed, attack range and access to abilities unavailable in a human form. The tattoo on Jen's back also glows when in a demon form, corresponding to various forms. Defeating enemies involves weakening enemies to the point where their hit points reach zero, at which time a finishing move must be performed to kill the enemy. While the moves differ in style and time taken, the final effect remains the same. Enemies can be finished off before the health bar reaches zero, and doing so leaves more residual energy. While Jen can remain in a demonic form indefinitely, taking damage will reduce health. However, hit points here are represented by demonic energy. When an enemy is killed, the remaining energy can be drained through use of Scree, who can store the energy for when it is needed. Jen can then call on the energy, siphoning it off to replenish her own. Scree can store a vast amount of energy, but also has limits as to how much. When in control of Scree, the player is invulnerable; Scree, being a gargoyle, cannot suffer damage, making him an effective scout. Scree is capable of climbing on stone walls, a necessary ability when traversing the realms. Scree can also store drained energy from dead enemies, which can be used to replenish Jen's demonic health, though he must remain immobile when doing so. Scree is revealed to be the long-lost Abdizur, who disappeared following an encounter with the lord of Chaos. In Solus, for a temporary amount of time, the player possesses a life-size statue of Abdizur via Scree, to combat Belhazur when Jen's powers are not fit to do so. The player may also possess other statues in an area under given circumstances. The player may also happen across various energy crystals, which can be stored and used if Scree's energy reserves are not enough and the player is at low health. These crystals are kept throughout the game, the only exclusion being when revisiting previous scenes, at which point they are reduced to a default amount. This means that the crystals function as extra lives, to a degree. If Jen is in human form, her health replenishes automatically if she is not in battle (human form only; demon energy must be replenished by either drawing on Scree's reserve energy or, failing that, by using a crystal). While in human form, Jen's health represents her presence in the demon world. If she loses all her health while in human form, she is returned to the human world, where she is in a near-death state. When this happens, the player must direct Scree to the nearest rift gate within a time limit (not seen on screen, though the voice of Arella warns the player that time is running out). If Scree does not reach a rift gate in time, Jen dies, and the game is over. Throughout the game, constant saving can prove onerous, particularly if the player wishes to backtrack and revisit certain areas. Provided a save game is present, the player may do so, and can revisit nearly all of the locations, once they have been unlocked via an in-game cutscene. =Demonic Forms= Ferai The first form gained by Jen, which offers increased stamina, strength, agility, and focuses on melee punches and kicks, for close range combat, as well as claw-like energy weapons. This form boosts her speed, which makes it ideal for travelling through the world. It also allows her to jump much higher than her human form, allowing her to overcome obstacles in the game. Undine The second form obtained by Jen, the Undine form is useless above water, prolonged use of which will reduce Jen's demonic health to one, where she can be killed in a single strike. While underwater, her health replenishes automatically, and she gains energy tentacles to strike enemies from a distance. This is the only form which regenerates instantly, as a majority of the realm's journey is spent underwater, and Scree is unavailable. The Undine form also offers instant telepathy, allowing the player to interact with Scree instantly. Wraith The third form obtained by Jen, the Wraith form offers melee combat from afar, utilizing an energy whip and main-gauche to inflict damage on the vampiric Wraith. While in this form, Jen can also utilize the Time- Shift ability, which allows her to briefly stop time, and slip past enemies when combat is not desired. Djinn The fourth and final form obtained by Jen, the Djinn form gives Jen incredible power with two energy blades, which can be fused together to create a single blade of immense power. Plot The battle to save the outside world starts within as Jen Tate, a young woman of our world, faces the demons of alternate planes and discovers her own supernatural origin. In Oblivion, there are four distinct realms, each occupied by a demon race. Two are aligned with order and two with chaos. But the scales of balance are overthrown, and chaos is engulfing Oblivion. =Mortalis= The place where Jen and Lewis are from, the \\"real\\" world. Belahzur used his power to abduct Lewis from Mortalis. The game starts in a club where Lewis and his band play, Lewis spots a tall monstrous looking man in the crowd (who is later revealed to be a demon called Balahzur) and he gets frightened. After the show Jen talks with Lewis and Lewis informs Jen about the scary looking figure in the crowd but Jennifer dismisses Lewis's fears. As they make their way out of the club Balahzur follows them until he is stopped by the doorman resulting to the doorman's decapitation. The pair witnessing the event try to make a run for it but Balahzur takes his true form and grabs Lewis critically wounding Jennifer in the process. =Nexus= The place where it all comes together. It is here that Chronos uses the Oracle machine to maintain the balance of Oblivion. All the realms can be entered through the Nexus. =Oblivion= The name given to all four realms. Solum A harsh realm where the sun never shines and an eternal winter blankets the ground and freezes the soul. This is a world reminiscent of the mortal Ancient Rome with columns high enough to reach the gods, and arenas to honour the brave and strong.:.,. Primal .,.:.,. PlayStation.com .,.: The occupants of this realm are the Ferai. Although fierce, strong and rugged in appearance. the Ferai are fundamentally a good race, aligned with the forces of Order. Scree notes that each king of the Ferai has vast power and strength, but at the height of his power, must sacrifice himself, or the entire realm will collapse. Further, this is traditionally accomplished using an object called \\"the Burning Crown.\\" The king and queen are named Herne and Queen Davena. In this realm Jen learns her first demon form, based on the Ferai race. Aquis Under an eternal Autumn sunset, deep beneath an endless, poisonous ocean lies the sub-aquatic realm of Aquis. The deadly waters are home to vast sea monsters, but the occupants of this realm, the Undine, have built their own safe-havens where they can live their lives free from the leviathans and the polluted waters of the deep. The Undine are able to communicate telepathically and survive only due to complex water purification machines. This humanoid race is perfectly adapted to life underwater with efficient gills and fins that power them through the shadowy depths. The queen of the realm is named Aino. Jen's second demon form is based on the Undine race. Aetha Set in the cloud-draped peaks is the far-from-heavenly realm of Aetha. The sheer mountains and treacherous rocks mean the inhabitants have to make their precarious homes on the plateaus and peaks above the clouds. The gloom and drizzle hides Tudor- like architecture with foreboding towers, heavy black beams and crumbling white walls. Overhanging balconies seek to steal what little light the street lanterns cast. The occupants of Aetha are the Wraith race. These fearsome and cadaverous beings have created a warped aristocratic society, with the ruling Wraith class living a life of opulence and excess while the \\"Helot\\" peasants live in filth and squalor. Unsurprisingly the ruling class is selfish and evil, throwing lavish masked balls within sight of the starving masses. The Wraith are shown to have vampiric characteristics, such as increased powers and vitality through drinking helot blood. The leaders of Wraith aristocracy are Count Raum and Countess Empusa. Jen's third demon form is based on the Wraith race. Volca A wasted landscape of sand and rock forms Volca, the fourth realm. An endless scorched desert, the burning horizon is dominated by a vast volcano. Volcan architecture is very similar to that of the Aztecs or ancient Egyptians. This realm's occupants are the Djinn race. The Djinn are quite possibly the strongest of Oblivion's inhabitants. Their bodies are formed from a living metal:.,. Primal .,.:.,. PlayStation.com .,.: and they resemble ancient Egyptian gods. Their health is linked directly to the rhythms of the volcano; when it is dormant they are at their weakest and as it builds towards the violent eruption they feel their most empowered. (As Scree says, \\"When [the volcano] erupts, we'd better be long gone.\\") Jen's fourth and final demon form is based on the Djinn race. Characters =Allied with Order= * Jen (Hudson Leick), the main playable character, who grew up in a string of foster homes. She works as a waitress so she can go to college. She has a short temper and a sharp tongue, but is compassionate as well. Throughout the game, she obtains the ability to transform herself into various demon forms, therefore making her an exceptional fighter and very skillful in all categories. * Scree (Andreas Katsulas), the secondary playable character. A diminutive gargoyle who guides Jen through her journey. Although he is unable to fight, he has the ability to project his spirit into other gargoyles in order to take control of them. He is often annoyed by Jen's light-hearted insults about his size and form; however, he hides a painful secret. * Arella (Niki Felstead), the embodiment of Order, Arella strives to uphold the balance, summoning Jen as her champion to battle against Abaddon, therefore making her the enemy of Abbadon =Neutral= * Chronos, part of a machine known as the Oracle. He helps maintain balance in Oblivion by equally dividing energy between Arella and Abaddon. =Allied with Chaos= * Abaddon (Colin McFarlane), the embodiment of Chaos. An evil being, he is supported by the demons of Aetha and Volca realms. * Belahzur, Abaddon's right-hand man, General of the Chaos armies and Abdizur's arch-enemy. * Lewis (Eric Loren), Jen's boyfriend, who is the lead singer in an upcoming rock band. Lewis is kidnapped in the beginning of the game and is revealed to have been brainwashed into acting as Abaddon's champion. Development =Music= Primal features music by electronic rock band 16Volt. Some of the tracks presented in the game are: * Suffering You (fight music) -Written by Eric Powell, John Desalvo and Mike Peoples * Alkali (fight music) -Written by Eric Powell, John Desalvo and Mike Peoples * Happy Pill (fight music) -Written by Eric Powell and Mike Peoples * Blessed (fight music) * At The End (during credits) * Moutheater (menu screen) -Written by Eric Powell and Mike Peoples * And I Go (fight music) * Everyday Everything (fight music) -Written by Eric Powell and Mike Peoples * Keep Sleeping (fight music) * Plastic Blue -Written by Eric Powell * At The End -Written by Eric Powell and Krayge Tyler The combat tracks from Primal feature on the album SuperCoolNothing V2.0 from 16 Volt, and the band had a cameo appearance in Primal, where they played in a club in the opening cut scene. The \\"cinematic tracks\\" were composed by Andrew Barnabas and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. A suite dedicated to its music was performed at the historic Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig 2003. Reception Primal received mixed to positive reviews. It received a score of 76.81% on GameRankings and 73/100 on Metacritic. IGN said that the game was \\"Limited by an inconsequential combat system and basic wander-puzzles. What it does manage to do though is overwhelm us with high-quality production values, wow us with an excellent graphical presentation, and move us with one hell of a killer soundtrack.\\" In the article \\"Overrated/Underrated\\" in their September 2004 issue, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine cited the game's protagonist as an underrated \\"hot chick\\" in comparison to Lara Croft, stating \\"She's smart. She's funny. She hangs out in biker bars. She's good in a fight. And she's got a really nice butt.\\" In the same article, Scree was likewise cited as an underrated sidekick, stating \\"This is the way to make a memorable sidekick: Make him dignified, make him funny looking, and make him useful.\\"OPM Staff (September 2004). \\"Overrated/Underrated\\" (SWF transcript). Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine Eurogamer, on the other hand, stated: \\"A rank combat system, quirky camera and a lack of inspiration at the game's exploration/puzzle core make playing the game hard work.\\" References External links Primal at Sony PlayStation website (North America) * Video game cleanup 2003 video games Action-adventure games Video games about demons Fantasy video games PlayStation 2 games PlayStation Network games Sony Interactive Entertainment games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games featuring female protagonists ","title":"Primal (video game)"},{"id":"1790381","text":"Carulla is a Colombian supermarket chain owned by Grupo √âxito and headquartered in Bogot√°, Colombia.

Later, he became a New Zealand pioneer before returning to Denmark to become a bishop and politician once more.

Accessed 2 June 2015 He became a co-editor of the publication, F√¶drelandet, in 1840, and was a leading figure in the National Liberal Party and spearheaded the movement towards a constitutional Denmark. Monrad wrote the draft to the liberal 1849 Constitution of Denmark, with structure and many phrases similar to the current. In it he coined the term 'people's church'. The constitution was quite democratic for its time; largely a result of the political and philosophical positions formulated by Monrad.Kaare R. Skou, Land at lede, K√∏benhavn, Lindhardt og Ringhof. 2008. Monrad became the first Minister of School and Church Affairs (\\"Kultus\\") in 1848; he held the same position in 1859 as well as 1860-63. He was also Minister of the Interior 1860-61. He was the bishop of the Lolland‚ÄìFalster diocese 1849-54, and a member of Parliament 1849-65.

As Council President (1863-1864), Monrad was the Danish state leader during the early part of Second Schleswig War, against the German Confederation led by Otto von Bismarck. With none of the other National Liberal bigwigs wanting to continue in office, Monrad became the most, arguably often the only, important figure for cabinet decision making. Yet, at critical moments during the war, Monrad was indecisive. Thus, during an armistice, he let the king decide on a peace proposal at the London Conference to divide Schleswig approximately along the language line between majorities of Danish and German speakers (see also the Schleswig-Holstein Question).Claus Bj√∏rn and Carsten Due-Nielsen, Fra helstat til nationalstat 1814-1914. Dansk udenrigspolitisk historie, K√∏benhavn, Gyldendal. 2006. The king, who held an unrealistic hope to maintain a personal union with the duchies, rejected, the conference ended with no result, and war resumed resulting in further military defeat. Next, the king dismissed Monrad and his government. The Peace of Vienna resulted in the loss of much of the monarchy's territory, including almost all of Schleswig. Denmark got relegated to a minor power. In what was labelled his speech of madness Monrad spoke in parliament for continued resistance and against ratifying the peace treaty even if such action would look like 'madness'. Following the war, a depressed and disillusioned Monrad emigrated to New Zealand. After sending his sons to Nelson and other districts of New Zealand to scout for land, he chose to settle in Palmerston North in the North Island of New Zealand. He bought of land at Karere Block. He first lived in a small hut and then erected a timber house and started clearing bushland. He and his family farmed cows and sheep. Monrad helped the New Zealand Company to find suitable settlers from Scandinavia and helped many Danish immigrants find land to settle on, most notably in the area of Dannevirke. His work was disturbed by MƒÅori who had been illegally robbed of their land, members of the Hauhau religion under Chief Titokowaru. Monrad buried his belongings and went with the family to Wellington and then went back to Denmark in 1869. His sons Viggo and Johannes later returned to Karere to become farmers. Before leaving New Zealand, he presented to New Zealand's Colonial Museum a collection of 600 woodcuts, etchings and engravings by European Old Masters, including Rembrandt, Hollar, Albrecht D√ºrer and van Dyck. They are now part of the collection at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa where examples often feature in temporary exhibitions. Monrad Intermediate is a Palmerston North intermediate school named after Monrad. After his return Monrad again became bishop of the Lolland-Falster diocese from 1871 until his death. He also again began became a member of parliament 1882-1886. Now, he publicly promoted the original and more liberal 1849 constitution against the conservative revision of 1866. His sharp mind and sense of the public mood was still feared by his opponents. He also defended himself against condemnations for the 1864 defeat while he acknowledged personal responsibility for the poor conduct and result of the peace negotiations.Monrad's newsletter defence in 1870 on the London conference. Accessed 11 February 2018 Monrad became one of the earliest and most outspoken Danish opponents of Darwin's new theories about evolution. Monrad published throughout most of his life about political and religious matters.Bibliography for D. G. Monrad. Accessed 12 February 2018 His book from 1876 about prayer came in many reprints, is still cited and used in religious practice and got translated into five languages, including English.Skovsgaard on prayer. Accessed 11 February 2018 Monrad was respected for his intellect, idealism, and industriousness. His both theoretical and practical interest in political and ecclesiastical matters had a huge and lasting impact, primarily through the constitution but also a number of legal reforms bear witness of an able politician and administrator. Yet, he showed himself an erratic political leader during the 1864 war ending in disastrous defeat. Ever since, Monrad's legacy was split between these extremes. The historian Aage Friis characterized Monrad as 'one of the most outstanding but at the same time most enigmatic characters in modern Danish history, and the most difficult person to portray'. There is a debate on whether Monrad's mental state affected his decision-making during the war, in particular dismissing the supreme commander and the break-up of the London Conference. The 1864 (TV series) portrays Monrad as a maniac nationalist. Other historians point out the high complexity of the situation; the absence in cabinet of other experienced ministers, including the other National Liberal leaders who had made the important decision leading up to the war and ignited the nationalistic public mood but now leaving Monrad to himself; the opinion and dynastic position of the new king; the mixed messages of other European powers; as well as how formidable Bismarck showed himself to be as an opponent with a distinct cause for winning a war as a stepping stone towards German unification.

The band consists of brothers Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Shannon Leto (drums, percussion). During the course of its existence, it has undergone various line-up changes. The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of its second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world. Its next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as it incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. It was followed by America (2018), which polarized critics upon release. As of September 2014, the band had sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing elements from a wide variety of genres, through its use of philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums, and experimental music. Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout its career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s. History =1998‚Äì2000: Formation and first years= Thirty Seconds to Mars started in 1998 in Los Angeles, California, as a collaboration between brothers Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, who had been playing music together since their childhood. The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist Solon Bixler and bassist Matt Wachter to the line-up. Additional guitarist Kevin Drake, who first auditioned for the position of bassist, also joined the band as a touring musician. The band played its first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name \\"Thirty Seconds to Mars\\", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex. Jared Leto described the name as \\"a reference, a rough translation from the book. I think the idea is interesting, it's a metaphor for the future,\\" he explained. \\"Thirty seconds to Mars‚Äîthe fact that we're so close to something that's not a tangible idea. Also Mars being the God of War makes it really interesting, as well. You could substitute that in there, but what's important for my brother and I, is that it be imaginative and really represent the sound of our music in as unique a way as possible.\\" He described it as a name that \\"works on several different levels, a phrase that is lyrical, suggestive, cinematic, and filled with immediacy.\\" When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started, Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band. By 1998, the group performed gigs at small American venues and clubs. Their eponymous debut album had been in the works for a couple of years, with Leto writing the majority of the songs. During this period, the band recorded demo tracks such as \\"Valhalla\\" and \\"Revolution\\", or \\"Jupiter\\" and \\"Hero\\", which later appeared on the band's debut album as \\"Fallen\\" and \\"Year Zero\\" respectively, but also \\"Buddha for Mary\\". Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to Immortal Records. In 1999, Virgin Records entered into the contract. =2001‚Äì03: Debut album= Thirty Seconds to Mars retreated to the isolation of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they grew up listening to his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt he was the only one who could help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August. The band released their first studio album, 30 Seconds to Mars, on August 27, 2002 in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. Jared Leto described the record as a concept album that focuses on human struggle and self-determination, in which otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas are used to illustrate a truthful personal situation. The album reached number 107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers, selling 121,000 copies in the United States. It was preceded by the single \\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\\", which peaked at number 31 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; music critic Megan O'Toole felt that the band has \\"managed to carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm.\\" The album was a slow- burning success, and eventually sold two million copies worldwide as of March 2011. In October 2002, the band toured with I Mother Earth and Billy Talent on MTV Campus Invasion. The following month, Thirty Seconds to Mars made their first appearance on television on Last Call with Carson Daly and opened concerts for Our Lady Peace and Sevendust. Released in 2003, \\"Edge of the Earth\\" became the second single from the album. In early 2003, Bixler left the band due to issues primarily related to touring. He was later replaced by Tomo Miliƒçeviƒá, who successfully auditioned for the part of guitarist. The band later went on tour with Chevelle, Trust Company, and Pacifier, and took a slot on the 2003 Lollapalooza tour. =2004‚Äì08: A Beautiful Lie= Thirty Seconds to Mars returned to the studio in March 2004 to begin working on their second album A Beautiful Lie, with Josh Abraham producing. During the recording process, the band traveled to four different continents to accommodate Jared Leto's acting career. A Beautiful Lie was notably different from the band's debut album, from both musical and lyrical aspect. \\"On the first record I created a world, then hid behind it,\\" Leto said. \\"With A Beautiful Lie, it was time to take a more personal and less cerebral approach. Although this record is still full of conceptual elements and thematic ideas it is ultimately much more wrapped around the heart than the head. It's about brutal honesty, growth, change. It's an incredibly intimate look into a life that is in the crossroads. A raw emotional journey. A story of life, love, death, pain, joy, and passion. Of what it is to be human.\\" A Beautiful Lie was released on August 30, 2005 in the United States. It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million. Its lead single, \\"Attack\\", made its radio debut on June 6, 2005 and became the most added track on American modern rock radio during its first week of release. During 2005, Thirty Seconds to Mars went on tour with Chevelle, Audioslave and The Used. The group embarked on their first headlining tour Forever Night, Never Day in March 2006. At the same time, the band released the album's second single, \\"The Kill\\", which set a record for the longest- running hit in the history of the US Modern Rock chart when it remained on the national chart for more than 50 weeks, following its number three peak in 2006. Its music video, directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins, received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award. Thirty Seconds to Mars live in Germany during the A Beautiful Lie tour In October 2006, the band began their Welcome to the Universe Tour, sponsored by MTV2, and were supported by Head Automatica, The Receiving End of Sirens, Cobra Starship, and several other bands including Street Drum Corps. The third single from the album, \\"From Yesterday\\", was released in November 2006 and became the band's first number one on the Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks. Jared Leto directed a short film for the single, which became the first ever American music video shot in the People's Republic of China in its entirety. A Beautiful Lie was released in Europe in February 2007. During the year, Thirty Seconds to Mars toured extensively throughout Europe and played at several major festivals, including Roskilde, Pinkpop, Rock am Ring, and Download. In March 2007, Matt Wachter left the group to spend more time with his family and was replaced by Tim Kelleher, performing live only. On November 1, 2007, Thirty Seconds to Mars won an MTV Europe Music Award in the category of Best Rock. The band also received the Kerrang! Award for Best Single in two consecutive years for \\"The Kill\\" and \\"From Yesterday\\" in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The album's title track, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", was released as the fourth single in North America and selected European countries. Its music video was filmed 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland, and proceeds from the sales benefited the Natural Resources Defense Council. At the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 6, Thirty Seconds to Mars earned their second Best Rock and Best Video for \\"A Beautiful Lie\\". =2008‚Äì11: EMI lawsuit and This Is War= Performing in Orlando, Florida during their Into the Wild Tour Thirty Seconds to Mars began recording their third studio album This Is War in August 2008. To produce the record, the band worked with Flood and Steve Lillywhite. Thirty Seconds to Mars had attempted to sign with a new label after the A Beautiful Lie tour, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin) to file a lawsuit for $30 million. EMI claimed that the band had failed to produce three of the five records they were obligated to deliver under their 1999 contract, which Virgin entered into with the now-defunct Immortal Records. Jared Leto responded to some of the claims in the suit stating \\"under California law, where we live and signed our deal, one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years.\\" Thirty Seconds to Mars had been contracted for nine years, so the band decided to exercise their \\"legal right to terminate our old, out-of-date contract, which, according to the law is null and void.\\" After nearly a year of the lawsuit battle, the band announced on April 28, 2009, that the case had been settled. The suit was resolved following a defense based on a contract case involving actress Olivia de Havilland decades before. Leto explained, \\"The California Appeals Court ruled that no service contract in California is valid after seven years, and it became known as the De Havilland Law after she used it to get out of her contract with Warner Bros.\\" Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI. Leto said the band had resolved their differences with EMI and the decision had been made because of \\"the willingness and enthusiasm by EMI to address our major concerns and issues, [and] the opportunity to return to work with a team so committed and passionate about Thirty Seconds to Mars.\\" In a bid to involve their fans for This Is War, Thirty Seconds to Mars held an event, called The Summit, at the Avalon Club in Los Angeles, where they invited fans to provide backing vocals and percussion. After the success of the initial Summit, the group repeated the event in eight countries and extended it digitally. The band also invited fans to submit close-up shots of their faces in order to make 2,000 different individual covers for the album. Leto described This Is War as a record about survival: \\"It was a two-year creative battle that was ferocious and tough but creatively rewarding, and all of those adverse elements, in hindsight, made us stronger and made the record stronger.\\" Thirty Seconds to Mars playing in Manchester, England in February 2010 Although the release date was changed many times, This Is War was eventually released in December 2009. The album reached the top ten of several national album charts and entered the Billboard 200 at number 18, with first-week sales of 67,000 in the United States. Its first two singles, \\"Kings and Queens\\" and \\"This Is War\\", reached the number- one spot on the US Alternative Songs chart. After a promotional tour in winter 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars embarked on their Into the Wild Tour in February 2010. At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, \\"Kings and Queens\\" received four nominations, including Video of the Year and Best Direction, and went on to win Best Rock Video. The album's third single, \\"Closer to the Edge\\", was the 2010 best-selling rock single in the United Kingdom, topping the UK Rock Chart for eight consecutive weeks. Thirty Seconds to Mars collaborated with rapper Kanye West on the song \\"Hurricane\\", which was released on the deluxe edition of This Is War and became the album's fourth single in some countries. On November 7, Thirty Seconds to Mars and West performed \\"Hurricane\\" at the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards at the Puerta de Alcal√° in Madrid, where the band also received their third Best Rock. On May 13, 2011, Thirty Seconds to Mars recorded a performance for the television program MTV Unplugged. They performed with musicians from the Vitamin String Quartet and invited a gospel choir to join the group for a rendition of U2's song \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". A Songkick study indicated that, based on quantity of tour dates, Thirty Seconds to Mars was among the hardest-working touring artists in 2010. On October 16, 2011, it was announced that the band would enter the Guinness World Records for most live shows during a single album cycle, with 300 shows. The 300th show, called Tribus Centum Numerarae, took place on December 7, 2011 at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and was followed by a special series of shows which marked the end of the Into the Wild Tour. =2012‚Äì15: Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams= Thirty Seconds to Mars took a break from touring in 2012 and spent most of the year recording their fourth album, entitled Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. The album was produced by Jared Leto with previous collaborator Steve Lillywhite. Leto said that the band took a new direction with Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. He explained that the album \\"is more than an evolution, it's a brand new beginning. Creatively, we've gone to an entirely new place, which is exciting, unexpected, and incredibly inspiring.\\" In September 2012, Artifact, a documentary about the band's legal battle against the record label EMI and the making of This Is War, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and won the People's Choice Documentary Award. Thirty Seconds to Mars in Moscow, Russia in March 2014 In February 2013, it was announced that \\"Up in the Air\\" would be the first single from the fourth album. In partnership with NASA, Thirty Seconds to Mars launched the first copy of \\"Up in the Air\\" aboard the Dragon spacecraft on SpaceX CRS-2. The mission was launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on March 1, 2013, sending the first ever commercial copy of music into space. On March 18, 2013, the single premiered from the International Space Station, after a Q&A; session with the band and Expedition 35 flight engineer Tom Marshburn, while Annise Parker, mayor of the city of Houston, proclaimed the Thirty Seconds to Mars Day. \\"Up in the Air\\" made its radio debut on March 18 and became commercially available for downloading the following day. The song reached number three on the US Alternative Songs chart and experienced success in international markets. Thirty Seconds to Mars released Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams on May 21, 2013, through Universal in the United States. The album received generally positive reviews and reached the top ten in more than fifteen countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. The band began their Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour in June, which included festival dates at Rock Werchter, Pinkpop, Rock in Rio, and Rock am Ring. The second single from the album, \\"Do or Die\\", achieved a level of play on modern rock radio, while \\"City of Angels\\", the third single, was released to rave reviews from critics and eventually reached number eight on the Alternative Songs chart in the US. At the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, held on August 25, \\"Up in the Air\\" won the award for Best Rock Video. Thirty Seconds to Mars announced on April 25, 2014 that they have parted from Virgin Records after tumultuous years with the label, with Leto telling Billboard, \\"We're free and clear and excited about the future. It's the most wonderful place to be.\\" In August 2014, the group embarked on a double-headline tour, dubbed the Carnivores Tour, with American rock band Linkin Park, visiting arenas and stadiums throughout North America. Thirty Seconds to Mars then launched a music festival called Camp Mars. The first edition took place in Malibu, California, in August 2015 and included a series of activities in a semi- rustic setting and several DJ sets. =2015‚Äìpresent: America and the departure of Miliƒçeviƒá= Performing at the 2018 Rock im Park during the Monolith Tour On November 3, 2015, it was announced that Thirty Seconds to Mars are working on their fifth studio album. In August 2016, the band revealed to have signed to Interscope Records. The group later unveiled that they would embark on a North American tour with Muse and PVRIS, which took take place from May to September 2017. In August 2017, \\"Walk on Water\\" was announced as the lead single from the band's fifth album. Thirty Seconds to Mars then performed the song at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards featuring special guest Travis Scott. During the ceremony, Jared Leto received media attention for his tribute to musicians Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell, who both died earlier that year. On January 25, 2018, Thirty Seconds to Mars released \\"Dangerous Night\\" as the second single from their upcoming fifth studio album. In February 2018, the band officially announced the Monolith Tour with Walk the Moon, Misterwives, K. Flay, Joywave, and Welshly Arms. Thirty Seconds to Mars later confirmed America as title of their fifth album, which was released on April 6, 2018. The album received polarizing reviews from critics and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, becoming the band's highest entry on the chart. America also reached the top ten in seventeen other countries, including number one in Germany and Austria. During the first leg of the Monolith Tour, it was announced that Miliƒçeviƒá would be taking a break from touring due to personal matters. On June 11, 2018, he officially announced his departure from the band. Musical style The style of the band's first studio album combined progressive metal and space rock with influences and elements from electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. Ryan Rayhill from Blender described the album as a \\"high-minded space opera of epic scope befitting prog-rock prototypes Rush,\\" and wrote that Thirty Seconds to Mars \\"emerged with an eponymous debut that sounds like Tool on The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" referring to the 1973 album by Pink Floyd. Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics focus on human struggle and self-determination, A Beautiful Lie's lyrics are more personal and the music introduces screaming vocals. The transformation that resonates throughout the album reflects the personal and artistic changes experienced by the band members before and during the creation of the record. The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins. Their third release This Is War was described as \\"an extremely progressive rock sound with killer choruses,\\" drawing inspirations from experimental Pink Floyd to melodic M83. Chris Harris from Rolling Stone considered it \\"an ambitious collection of experimental rock\\" shaped by the band's personal struggles and legal battle with their record label. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic acknowledged the band's progression, referring to the overall style of the record as a mixture of synth rock, heavy metal, and progressive rock. In Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams the band experimented with different instruments and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of styles. The album mixes experimental instrumentation with elements both symphonic and electronic, and the music introduces a minimalist approach full of ethereal sonics. The record carries the concept album format of This Is War and expands the spectrum to revolve around the themes after which it is named. Activism Thirty Seconds to Mars launched a website, called abeautifullie.org, to provide information about environmental issues and ways to participate in environmental activities. People can make donations through the site to support the Natural Resources Defense Council. In 2006, Jared Leto created the cover art for The 97X Green Room: Volume 2, a compilation of live music that includes a Thirty Seconds to Mars song, which proceeds from the sales benefited The Nature Conservancy. During their Welcome to the Universe Tour, the group worked to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption to offset the impact that the tour would have had on the environment. In June 2008, the band joined Habitat for Humanity to work on a home being repaired and renovated through the Greater Los Angeles Area's \\"A Brush With Kindness\\" programme. In advance of the build, the band organized an auction of \\"build slots\\" to give fans the opportunity to volunteer alongside them. In less than a week, six extra workers were enlisted and over $10,000 was raised to fund additional Habitat for Humanity projects. Thirty Seconds to Mars fans, termed as the Echelon, started several philanthropic organizations and projects with the purpose of supporting various charities and humanitarian causes. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Thirty Seconds to Mars raised $100,100 for Haitian relief through a charity auction. The band has also supported the Haitian population through the Echelon project \\"House for Haiti\\" and Hope For Haiti Now telethon special. The group auctioned a quantity of items raising funds to help the Red Cross assist people affected by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The band contributed one dollar per concert ticket sold on the Carnivores Tour to the charity Music for Relief to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment.

It is located at a former quarry (from which it takes its name) in Waterford. With a total capacity of over 2 GW, the station produces enough electricity to power about 2 million homes. The operation of the Millstone Power Station supports more than 3,900 jobs, and generates the equivalent of over half the electricity consumed in Connecticut. The Millstone site covers about 500 acres (2 km¬≤). The power generation complex was built by a consortium of utilities, using Niantic Bay (which is connected to Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean) as a source of coolant water. Millstone Units 2 and 3, both pressurized water reactors (one from Westinghouse and one from Combustion Engineering), were sold to Dominion Resources by Northeast Utilities in 2000 and continue to operate. The plant has had numerous safety-related shutdowns and at times been placed on enhanced examination status by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In 1999 Northeast Utilities, the plant's operator at the time, agreed to pay $10 million in fines for 25 counts of lying to federal investigators and for having falsified environmental reports. Its subsidiary, Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, paid an additional $5 million for having made 19 false statements to federal regulators regarding the promotion of unqualified plant operators between 1992 and 1996. On November 28, 2005, after a 22-month application and evaluation process, Millstone was granted a 20-year license extension for both units 2 and 3 by the NRC.NRC Renews Millstone Nuclear Power Station Operating Licenses For An Additional 20 Years Licensing history and milestones Work being performed on the containment structure at the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant. =Unit 1= Millstone 1 was a General Electric boiling water reactor, producing 660 MWe, shut down in November 1995 before being permanently closed in July 1998. * Construction permit issued: May 19, 1966 * Final safety analysis report filed: November 1, 1968 * Provisional operating license issued: October 7, 1970 * Full term operating license issued: October 31, 1986 * Full power license: October 7, 1970 * Initial criticality: October 26, 1970 * Synchronized to the grid: November 1970 * Commercial operation: December 28, 1970 * 100% power: January 6, 1971 * The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission began a safety investigation relating to refueling procedures, based on information provided by George Galatis, a senior nuclear engineer, 1995.NRC Failure to Adequately Regulate - Millstone Unit 1, 1995 * Leaking valve forced shutdown multiple equipment failures detected: February 20, 1996 * Permanently ceased operations: July 21, 1998 =Unit 2= Millstone 2 is a Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor plant built in the 1970s, and has a maximum power output of 2700 thermal megawatts, or MWth (870 MWe). It has 2 steam generators, and 4 reactor cooling pumps. It is undergoing an upgrade to its safe shutdown system which already met NRC standards. During its refueling outage in October 2006, the operator installed a new pressurizer. * Construction permit issued: December 11, 1970 * Final safety analysis report filed: August 15, 1972 * Full term operating licensing issued: September 26, 1975 * Full power license: September 26, 1975 * Initial criticality: January 17, 1975 * Commercial operation: December 26, 1975 * 100% power: March 20, 1976 * \\"Stretch power\\": June 25, 1979 * Operating license extension requested: December 22, 1986 * Operating license extension issued: January 12, 1988 * Full term operating license expires: December 11, 2010 * Operating license expires: July 31, 2015 * Extended operating license expires: July 31, 2035 =Unit 3= Millstone 3 is a Westinghouse plant that started operating in 1986, and has a maximum power output of 3411 MWth (1150 MWe). In the summer of 2008, the NRC approved a power uprate for Unit 3 that increased its electrical output 7.006% to 3650 MWth (1230 MWe). The increase took effect by the end of 2008. * Construction permit issued: August 9, 1974 * Initial criticality: January 23, 1986 * Commercial operation: April 23, 1986 * Operating license expires: November 25, 2025 * Extended operating license expires: November 25, 2045 Safety and environmental events In December 1977, two hydrogen explosions occurred at the plant. The second explosion injured one man, who required hospitalization. In October 1990, operator error during a routine test caused a shutdown of unit 2. In September 1991, twenty reactor operators failed required licensing examinations. The shortfall of licensed operators necessitated a shutdown of unit 1 until March 1992. In 1995 the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission began a safety investigation relating to refueling procedures at Millstone unit 1, based on information provided by George Galatis, a senior nuclear engineer.NRC Failure to Adequately Regulate - Millsone Unit 1, 1995 On February 26, 1996, a leaking valve forced the shutdown of units 1 and 2. Multiple equipment failures were found. Time magazine featured the plant on its cover, calling its operator a \\"rogue utility\\", and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission singled out Millstone for additional attention. Also in 1996, the plant released one gallon per hour of hydrazine into Long Island Sound. The plant's operators were convicted in 1999 for falsifying environmental records related to the hydrazine release. Following the Time article and the subsequent shutdown of all reactors, unit 2 restarted May 11, 1999 and unit 3 restarted July 1, 1998. Unit 1 was never restarted as the cost of remedying numerous safety issues was too high. In 2002 Millstone's operators were fined $288,000 for failing to have properly accounted for two uranium fuel rod components that had been misplaced 30 years earlier in 1972. On April 17, 2005, Millstone unit 3 safely shut down without incident when a circuit board monitoring a steam pressure line short- circuited, which caused the board to malfunction and indicate an unsafe drop in pressure in the reactor's steam system, when in reality there was no drop in steam pressure. The cause was attributed to tin whiskers on the board. In response to this event, Millstone implemented a procedure to inspect for these whiskers at every refueling outage, or 18 months.Reactor Shutdown: Dominion Learns Big Lesson From A Tiny ‚Äòtin Whisker' In September, 2009, unit 2 shut down when an electrical storm caused power fluctuations. When workers tried to restart the unit, they discovered a small leak in the reactor coolant pump.http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Millstone-2-operating-again-after- shutdown-6891.php#ixzz1GtOgmyQM On December 21, 2009 the Unit 3 reactor tripped and shut down for longer than 72 hours. On July 27, 2009, the Unit 2 reactor tripped and shut down for longer than 72 hours. On August 9, 2013, the Unit 3 reactor tripped and shut down due to a malfunction. In 2016, unit 3 was shut down following a hydrogen gas leak. Surrounding population The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.

Biography Wu Chien-ch'uan was taught martial arts by his father, Wu Ch'uan-yu, a senior student of Yang Luchan, and Yang Pan-hou. Both Wu Chien-ch'uan and his father were hereditary Manchu cavalry officers of the Yellow Banner as well as the Imperial Guards Brigade, yet the Wu family were to become patriotic supporters of Sun Yat-sen. At the time of the establishment of the Chinese Republic in 1912, China was in turmoil, besieged for many years economically and even militarily by several foreign powers, so Wu Chien-ch'uan and his colleagues Yang Shao-hou, Yang Chengfu and Sun Lu-t'ang promoted the benefits of t'ai chi ch'uan training on a national scale. They subsequently offered classes at the Beijing Physical Culture Research Institute to as many people as possible, starting in 1914. It was the first school to provide instruction in the art to the general public. Wu Chien-ch'uan was also asked to teach the Eleventh Corps of the new Presidential Bodyguard as well as at the nationally famous Ching Wu martial arts school. As the focus of t'ai chi ch'uan teaching in his time changed from a strictly military art to a discipline made available to the general public, Wu Chien-ch'uan modified the teaching forms he learned from his father somewhat. Wu Chien-ch'uan's changes to the initial forms shown to his students included smoothing overt expressions of fa chin, jumps and other abrupt time changes in the training routines in order to make those forms easier for the general public to learn. These modified elements were preserved and taught in various advanced forms and pushing hands, however. Wu Chien-ch'uan moved his family to Shanghai in 1928. In 1935, he established the Chien-ch'uan T'ai Chi Ch'uan Association (ÈëëÊ≥âÂ§™Ê•µÊã≥Á§æ) on the ninth floor of the Shanghai YMCA to promote and teach t'ai chi ch'uan. What he taught has since become known as Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan and is one of the five primary styles practised around the world, the others being Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan, Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan, Wu (Hao)-style t'ai chi ch'uan and Sun-style t'ai chi ch'uan. The Chien-ch'uan T'ai Chi Ch'uan Association schools have subsequently been maintained by Wu Chien-ch'uan's descendants. He was succeeded as head of the Wu family system by his oldest son, Wu Kung-i, in 1942. His second son, Wu Kung-tsao, also became a renowned t'ai chi ch'uan master. Wu Kung-i moved the family headquarters to the Hong Kong school (established in 1937) in 1949. Today the Association still has its international headquarters in Hong Kong and is currently managed by Wu Chien-ch'uan's great-grandson, Wu Kuang-yu, with branches in Shanghai, Singapore, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Tahiti, and France. Several of Wu's disciples also became well known t'ai chi teachers. Prominent in that number were the senior disciple, Ma Yueh-liang, Wu T'u-nan and Cheng Wing-kwong. His daughter Wu Yinghua and her husband Ma Yueh-liang continued running the Shanghai Chien- ch'uan T'ai Chi Ch'uan Association until their deaths in the mid 1990s.

History Hot Rod is the oldest magazine devoted to hot rodding, having been published since January 1948. Robert E. Petersen founded the magazine and his Petersen Publishing Company was the original publisher. The first editor of Hot Rod was Wally Parks, who went on to found the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA). Petersen Publishing was sold to British publisher EMAP in 1998, who then sold the former Petersen magazines to Primedia in 2001. Today it is published by TEN: The Enthusiast Network formerly known as Source Interlink Media. Source Interlink acquired the magazine along with Primedia's Consumer Magazine division in 2007. Hot Rod has a strategic relationship with Universal Technical Institute, referring to UTI as its sponsor. In March 1948, Hot Rod published the first appearance of Tom Medley's cartoon hot rodder, Stroker McGurk. The feature would survive until 1955.Alverson, Brigid. \\"Stroker McGurk‚Äô creator Tom Medley passes away\\", written 12 March 2014, at CBR.rom (retrieved 23 October 2018); Coonan, Steve. \\"Hot Rodding Legend Tom Medley Passes Away at 93\\", at Roddersjournal.com (retrieved 23 October 2018) Sponsored events Between 1961 and 1969, the Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races, \\"one of the most significant drag racing events\\" of that era, were hosted by the magazine at Riverside Raceway.Taylor, Thom. Untitled item in Hot Rod Magazine, February 2017, p.11. The championship offered a US$37,000 prize, greater even than a National Hot Rod Association national event prize at the time.Taylor, p.11. The \\"Hot Rod Power Tour\\" is an organized tour where hot rodders drive a pre-planned route throughout the United States. It began in 1995 when Hot Rod staff members decided to take some of their project cars on a cross-country drive from Los Angeles, California to Norwalk, Ohio. Thousands of people participated along the way but only seven participants (other than staff members) made the entire journey and were inducted into the original \\"Long Hauler Gang\\". Since its inception, this event has continued to gain in popularity and is now one of the most anticipated automotive events each year. It is typically six to eight days in length and held in late May or early June. In recent years, the tour has evolved to become what is essentially a continuous trek around the United States in that it begins in or near the location that it ended in the previous year. Each stop is combined with events or activities that vary as much as the participants themselves. The starting points can change from year to year on the power tour. Tour Stops along the way on the power tour often feature entertainment, celebrities, contests, and games.  Video games  ValuSoft has published Hot Rod: American Street Drag and Hot Rod: Garage to Glory, drag racing video games in which the goal is to win the cover feature of Hot Rod magazine.

Dot first appeared in EastEnders in July 1985 as the mother of notorious criminal Nick Cotton (John Altman). The character worked as a launderette assistant for most of that time, along with original character Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Dot moved away with her son and his family in 1993. In reality, Brown left the show in 1993, unhappy with the axing of her co-star Peter Dean, who played Pete Beale from the show's first episode to early 1993. Brown returned to the role in April 1997, and on 28 April 2017, Dot overtook Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement) as the second-longest-serving character in EastEnders, surpassed only by original character Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). In a special episode entitled EastEnders: Dot's Story (2003) a young Dot was played by Tallulah Pitt-Brown in flashbacks. In April 2012, Brown took a six- month break from the show to write her memoirs. Dot temporarily departed on 18 May 2012. She returned on 14 January 2013. In February 2015, Dot began appearing less frequently due to Brown gradually losing her eyesight; this aspect of her life was later written into her character the following year. Brown left the role in January 2020. A tragicomic character, Dot was known for her devout Christian faith, gossiping, chain smoking, hypochondria, and motherly attitude to those in need. A recurring storyline in the serial has been Dot's continuous forgiveness of her son's villainous crimes. Initially married at the start of the series to conman Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock), Dot married again in 2002 to pensioner Jim Branning (John Bardon) and the union proved to be popular with fans. Brown and Bardon won awards for their screen partnership. On 31 January 2008, Dot became the first character ever to appear in a monologue episode, \\"Pretty Baby....\\", of a British soap. The acclaimed episode saw Dot reminiscing about her years of loss and grief into a tape recorder as a message to her ailing husband Jim. Dot has been used to explore topical and controversial issues such as euthanasia, cancer, immigration and homophobia. Dot has been generally well received by critics: she has been referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections. Storylines =Backstory= Dot's backstory states that she was born in Walford, the main setting for EastEnders, and was evacuated to Wales as a child during the Second World War. Her guardians, Gwen (Eve Myles; Gwenllian Davies) and Will (Dafydd Emyr), wished to adopt her, but Dot returned to Walford after Will's death and spent the rest of her childhood helping her neglectful mother care for her younger half-siblings: Gerry, Tim and Rose (Polly Perkins). Aged 18, Dot married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock). The following year, he forced her to have an abortion; threatening to leave her if she did not, but left anyway. While Dot was giving birth to their son, Nick (John Altman), Charlie was having an affair with her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, with Charlie making unannounced returns and departures sporadically, and although Dot doted on Nick, she was not an affectionate mother. =1985‚Äì1993= Dot is introduced to EastEnders soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Lou Beale (Anna Wing) who works with Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie comes and goes, always treating Dot badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved in drugs, robberies and murder, and tries to cheat Dot out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, Dot believes he can be redeemed. Dot also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) and Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), who becomes addicted to drugs. Dot believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge. It is concluded that she died after choking on her own vomit, and Dot is devastated. However, Dot causes trouble for certain residents too, although not intentionally. She is responsible for the break-up of Saeed Jeffery's (Andrew Johnson) marriage to Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh). Due to the lack of lust in his marriage to Naima, Saeed begins visiting sex workers. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he does not deny it so she leaves him. In May 1989, Nick tells Dot during an off-screen prison visit that he is married to a woman called Hazel (Virginia Fiol), and that the couple have young daughter; Nick had avoided telling her due to their strained relationship. Hazel visits Dot with the baby, Dorothy Nicola, in May of the same year, revealing that Nick got 240 hours of community service) instead of a prison sentence. However, this is revealed to be a lie as Charlie follows Hazel and finds that the baby is actually her niece, Katy Joanna. Dot refuses to believe him at first but Hazel is forced to admit she has been lying. In 1993, Nick's girlfriend Zoe Newton (Elizabeth Chadwick) arrives in Walford and introduces Dot to their nine-year-old son, Ashley Cotton (Rossi Higgins). Dot becomes close to Ashley and eventually Zoe asks her to move to Gravesend with them. Dot then leaves Albert Square. =1997‚Äì2020= Dot returns nearly four years later when Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) tracks her down. She reveals that Nick has been arrested for drugs possession and Zoe and Ashley have moved away. After being held hostage by a convict friend of Nick, she returns to the square and is shocked when Nick returns unexpectedly. He tries to steal her money again by claiming he has AIDS and needs money to pay for illegally imported medication. Dot believes him but later discovers it is a lie and he is on the run from the police. She contacts the police, and he is arrested a week after his return. Dot moves in with fellow senior citizen Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes to stay with the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against euthanasia and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is imprisoned for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom. When Nick and Ashley (now Frankie Fitzgerald) reappear in Walford, Dot is pleased to have her family around and moves out of the Fowler household to live with them. However, Nick's feud with Pauline's son, Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), causes Ashley's death after Nick cuts the brakes on Mark's motorbike and Ashley steals it and crashes. Dot disowns Nick after Ashley's funeral, having overheard the truth about Ashley's death during an earlier argument between Nick and Mark. She starts a relationship with neighbour Jim Branning (John Bardon), but when he proposes, she is overwhelmed and leaves Walford. Jim perseveres and when they go on the London Eye one Christmas Eve, he proposes again and she accepts. They decide that they will have a platonic marital relationship. Dot is diagnosed with kidney cancer and decides not to tell anyone except her friend Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). She initially refuses treatment and plans to die quietly, but is eventually persuaded to undergo chemotherapy and makes a full recovery. When Dot finds an abandoned baby, Tomas, in a church, she takes him home, leaving her contact details at the church and subsequently Tomas' mother Anya (Olga Fedori) arrives in Walford, revealing she is an illegal immigrant. Jim anonymously reports Anya and when she is deported, Dot hides Tomas from the authorities, vowing to take care of him. Dot and Jim struggle to look after the baby and, after talking to the local vicar and her old friend Dr. Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), Dot decides to hand him over to Social Services. Jim suffers a stroke, leaving him seriously ill. Jim is placed in a nursing home, but Dot struggles with this decision and tries at a later date to care for Jim at home. However, she finds being a full-time carer exhausting and lonely. Eventually, after Dot experiences ill-health brought on by stress, Jim moves back to a nursing home. When Nick returns after a seven-year absence, he tells Dot he has changed and is now a plumber, introducing her to his six-year-old daughter Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin). However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage in the caf√©, resulting in an explosion. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, Sandy (Caroline Pegg), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, Dot is sorry to see Dotty go. Dot develops a friendship with vicar Edward Bishop (Frank Barrie), who develops romantic intentions towards her. Dot turns Edward down, remaining loyal to her husband. She takes in various lodgers, including Arthur \\"Fatboy\\" Chubb (Ricky Norwood), her sister Rose and Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), who causes Dot problems with the council for failing to pay the rent, leaving her in arrears. Dot is taken to court but manages to persuade the judge to allow her to keep her home and avoids a prison sentence. Fatboy later allows his girlfriend Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright) to move in with him and Dot, and Dot forms a close bond with Poppy. When Fatboy and Poppy break up and Poppy moves out, Fatboy gently assures Dot that she and Poppy are still friends. Dot receives a police visit, informing her that Nick has died. One of the police officers returns later to tell her that he is actually her grandson Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), a child of Nick's Dot had not known existed. A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery. Nick reappears in Walford to Dot's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house. Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good. However, Nick later realises that he does not want to leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie's fianc√©e, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), who tries and fails to ensure his departure. This leads to Nick tampering with the brakes of Charlie's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital. When Charlie discovers this, he demands that Nick leave, and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie's flat, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. However, Dot, unwilling to give up on her son, hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house. Unable to leave the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug addiction and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to call an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess to the police and is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months. Four months later, Dot is released and shares her regret with Ian that she did not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween, such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight. Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she has plans of her own. The launderette closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is too busy to visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children that they are in heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great- grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but he is only back for his son and she is upset when he leaves again with Matthew. Dot's step-granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot trips over Dave and falls awkwardly onto a chair. Nobody knows she is injured until her step- granddaughter, Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames her neighbours for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation on her hip but she refuses physiotherapy. Dot goes to stay with Dotty for three months, returning when she hears that Abi is brainstem dead after an accident. Dot is surprised to see the launderette had reopened and Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley) is working there. After attending Abi's funeral, Dot goes to stay with Charlie, Liz and Matthew in Ireland. Dot returns several months later. She is worried about her health and despite being told by her doctor that she is fine, she visits Dr Legg. He confirms that she is in good health and reveals he is dying of pancreatic cancer. Dot is shocked that he is refusing treatment but eventually accepts his decision and decides to make the most of the time they have left together. Dot cares for Dr Legg in her home until his death. She inherits his entire estate and goes away to visit her family. Dot returns with Dotty and she buys her council house with her inherited money. She later discovers that an attempt to take ¬£5,000 out of her bank account has failed. It is revealed that Sonia tried to take the money. Sonia is later blackmailed after Martin Fowler (James Bye) is involved in a hit-and-run and she successfully steals ¬£8,000 from Dot when Dot signs a blank cheque for Sonia to pay for some baby clothes she bought for the baby that Charlie and his wife are now expecting. Dot tells Sonia that this money was stolen and when Sonia tells Martin what she did, Martin tells Dot that he took the money. Sonia convinces Dot to visit Charlie again in Ireland and Dot leaves Sonia a message asking her to find out why Martin took the money and to let her know. Creation Although Dot had been referred to since the very early episodes of the programme as the mother of villain Nick Cotton (John Altman), she did not actually appear on-screen until episode 40 in July 1985. Dot was conceptualised by show creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, along with the other original characters. Introduced as the \\"bible thumping, arch-gossip\\" of the launderette, Dot was a character who bridged the generations. The actress June Brown was given the role after being recommended by actor Leslie Grantham, who played original character, Den Watts. Brown was offered the part of Dot Cotton for a period of three months initially and in her own words, she was brought in \\"merely to be Nick Cotton's mother because Nick was coming back again\\". Brown has told Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen EastEnders once on television, \\"and there was an argument going on, and I thought, 'Oh, I don't want to watch all that,' so I switched it off. I didn't watch it again until I was asked to be in it.\\" The role was extended and the character has become one of the longest-running to have featured in EastEnders. =Becoming Dot; characterisation= Appearance Dot as she appeared in July 1985. The image shows Dot's traditional \\"Italian Boy\\" hairstyle, a key characteristic of the character's appearance. During the early years of the programme, June Brown's hair was styled to create the look; however, Brown later started using a wig for Dot's hair. To become the character of Dot Cotton, Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot's 1950s \\"Italian Boy\\" hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985. Originally, the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress, but Brown later started wearing a wig. Brown has stated that as soon as Dot's hairpiece is on, she becomes the character. The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers, that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth, the producers refused to allow it, arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping. Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose. Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered. She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985. The fur-collared coat Dot wears for special occasions was donated by the character Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in 1988 when she left the serial. Brown commented, \\"I like the older clothes [...] I don't want new clothes, I'm happy the way she is. She thinks she looks really smart. She's got a terrible opinion of herself that woman!\\" Personality and religion Brown has said that when she was cast as Dot, she was given a list of illnesses the character had. She added, \\"It meant she was a because she had nobody to care about her. She was quite a selfish woman [initially].\\" Dot has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as a \\"born victim.\\" She adds that \\"with each blow that life delivers [Dot] bobs back up again, almost asking for more trouble, more pain, more suffering.\\" Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible. She has been described by Rupert Smith, author of 20 Years in Albert Square, as \\"God- bothering\\" and self-righteous. According to Kingsley, \\"nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals.\\" The character once expressed part of the reason for her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, \\"I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had\\"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son. He described her as a \\"simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate\\". In Kathryn and Phillip Dodd's published essay, From EastEnd to EastEnders, Dot has been used as an example of the media's representation of the working-class as community-orientated, but defensive: \\"evangelist-cum- launderette supervisor. Eagle-eyed, she patrols the Square, confronting evil and despair and asking those stricken with doubt to trust God, while simultaneously organizing the local Neighbourhood Watch scheme.\\" The character has taken on a matriarchal role in the absence of her own family, taking on the burdens of numerous waifs and strays throughout the show's history, including Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem), Disa O'Brien (Jan Graveson), Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) and Clare Bates (Gemma Bissix). Author Christine Geraghty asserts that Dot's role in the mothering structure of the serial has been confirmed. Describing Dot, Brown has said, \\"I love playing her ‚Äì she's a strong character. Dear old Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd religious beliefs, but her heart's in the right place. She has that awful worried expression on her face the whole time\\". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has \\"no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in an anxious state ‚Äì I like it when Dot's hysterical! She's also amusing, mostly because she doesn't realise she is\\". Comedic role As well as being tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has discussed the humour she incorporates into her performances: \\"I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If you want to play comedy then you have to be very intense about it [...] very, very serious.\\" Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as \\"Ooh I say!\\", uttered when she is \\"stuck for words\\". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: \\"It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on.\\" Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, \\"She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit.\\" Smoking Smoking cigarettes has become synonymous with Dot, and Brown has suggested that the habit is \\"intrinsic\\" to the character. Dot's smoking was criticised by private healthcare company Bupa in 2008, when they rated her television's most unhealthy character. They suggest that, in order to spread a public message, Dot should appear breathless, not with \\"implausibly good health\\". They added, \\"Though Dot Cotton has a smoker's voice ‚Äì deeper than you might expect, she does not seem to be short of breath or wheezy\\" and that viewers would be influenced by this. However, Dot's smoking has been described by broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom as \\"justified in the context of the programme as a representation of an East End character\\" and they therefore stipulate that enforcement of broadcast smoking-sanctions would be unlikely on EastEnders. Development Dot's launderette uniform =The gossip= Upon her arrival, Dot Cotton was quickly established as the gossip, whose purpose, as author Anthony Slide sees it, was \\"that of a Greek chorus, commenting on the foibles of her fellow residents of Albert Square, from her vantage point as manager of the local launderette\\". The \\"gossip\\" is a soap opera role that author Christine Geraghty has described as \\"crucial to the audience's engagement with a serial and provides both a source of information and a means of speculation for the viewer.\\" She asserts that a fundamental aspect of British soap is the idea of supporting members of community, based on the sharing of intimate knowledge, allowing \\"practical and emotional needs to be met\\" within the enclosed community. However, according to Geraghty, there is nevertheless \\"an unease about the price paid for such support and an acknowledgement of the fine-line between neighbourliness and nosiness. The 'gossip' personifies this unease and though her task of passing on information and ferreting out problems is crucial to the community, she [...] is frequently the butt of mockery and criticism [...] The avidity with which Dot Cotton seeks out news is the subject of some embarrassment to her more restrained neighbours but the exchange of information she provides is essential if the community is to provide support to its members [...] the very process of exchanging information makes her an essential yet mistrusted figure.\\" Indeed, it has been noted that, throughout the soap's early years, Dot was portrayed as a \\"lovable bigot\\", prejudiced against her neighbours and only happy when others were not. During the 1980s, Dot was shown to exhibit both racism and homophobia to members of the Walford community. In 1987, Dot was shown to respond negatively to Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) upon learning he was gay, reacting in \\"horror and ignorant self-righteousness\\" and spreading rumours that Colin had AIDS. According to Gary Loach from GaydarNation, Dot was being used by the programme makers to expose the bigotry of the \\"moral majority\\" in the real world following a public and media backlash over EastEnders' screening of its first homosexual kiss. However, while Dot has portrayed bigotry, author Anthony Slide has noted that the character can typically be \\"relied upon to drop her prejudices ‚Äì she learned to accept both blacks and homosexuals in Albert Square.\\" Despite Dot's remaining penchant for gossip, it has been noted by Cole Moreton of The Independent in 2008 that the character has \\"evolved from a nasty gossip into a strong character for whom viewers feel warmth\\". Author Dorothy Hobson has discussed this in her book Soap Opera, suggesting that Dot, while providing a narrative function as a gossip, has in turn been the subject of other people's gossip, with her own problems, troubles and vulnerability. =Notable relationships= Nick Dot's relationship with her wayward son Nick (John Altman), has been a feature of the character's narrative since her inception. Unlike Dot, Nick is scripted as a semi-regular character, one who comes and goes sporadically and, as authors Jill Marshall and Angela Werndly have observed, \\"we know heartache is in store for Dot Cotton every time her son, 'Nasty Nick', turns up [...] The recurrence of generic elements means we derive pleasure from expectation and prediction.\\" Executive producer Diederick Santer has discussed the \\"wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship\\" Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: \\"There‚Äôs that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone‚Äôs changed, which is really tragic. They‚Äôve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they‚Äôll have changed.\\" Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the \\"one friend in [Nick's] life\\", while series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: \\"Dot‚Äôs always going to forgive him. And that‚Äôs the beauty of Nick and Dot.\\" Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: \\"No matter what he does, she‚Äôll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.\\" One of Nick's most notable returns to the series occurred in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim that he was a born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her ¬£10,000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: \\"For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet.\\" With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new- found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting ‚Äì a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the \\"one time we saw a glimmer of Nick‚Äôs good side\\", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her. Other storylines have concentrated on Dot's various attempts to reform Nick, such as in 1991, when Nick returned with a heroin addiction. As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). The episode where Eddie was murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991. Nick stood trial in January 1993; however, \\"he got away with murder\\" for a second time in the serial. Other scams have included Nick's attempt to con Dot by claiming he had AIDS in 1998 after escaping from prison, which ultimately led to Dot having him re-imprisoned. Then followed a plot that saw him largely responsible for the death of his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) in June 2001, ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick and prompting to leave the Square again. He is not seen for more than seven years after this, although he was mentioned in 2006 when recovering from cancer off-screen. Following pleas from Brown to resurrect Nick, John Altman returned to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin), who was born in 2002 after Nick's previous exit. Altman explained: \\"Nick needed something, because I think if he didn‚Äôt have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast.\\" As the storyline progressed, it was revealed that Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot. In March 2014, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive. Nick reappears in Albert Square seven months after his faked death. Ronnie takes an instant dislike to him and tries to bribe him to leave but Nick returns for Charlie and Ronnie's wedding. Nick decides to get revenge on Ronnie and cuts the brakes of her car. After the wedding, Roxy, Charlie and Ronnie are involved in an accident which hits and later kills Emma Summerhayes, while Ronnie ends up in a coma but survives. Yvonne discovers that Nick cut the brakes of the car. Yvonne tells Charlie but he does not believe her until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him. Then Nick implicates Yvonne in Ronnie's accident, so Charlie asks them both to leave. Dot hides Nick next door and obtains heroin for Nick. Later she finds him unconscious, Nick regains consciousness briefly but later dies in Dot's arms, in the same location that Reg Cox was discovered 30 years earlier. Charlie Like Nick, Dot's first screen husband, Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock), was also a semi-regular character who came and went throughout his duration in the show. Depicted as bigamous and a conman, Charlie typically would reappear in the show whenever he needed money or temporary accommodation and, because of Dot's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness, Charlie would always be permitted to return. According to Christopher Hancock, Charlie was \\"a truly revolting character, a loser.\\" Producers decided to kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died off-screen when crashing his lorry on a motorway. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: \\"We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [Nick] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only in a state of shock and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [her friend] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change.\\" Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, \\"I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to\\". Charlie's funeral episode, written by Linda Dearsley, was aired on 11 July 1991, and was dominated by Dot's reaction to Charlie's death and her trip to identify his body. It is selected by writer Colin Brake as one of 1991's episodes of the year. Jim Jim proposes to Dot, 21 December 2001. The scenes were filmed on-location in one of the carriages on the Millennium Eye in central London away from the soap's typical set. The coat worn by Dot here was given to her in the soap by Angie Watts in the 1980s, and Brown has suggested that it's a rarely used part of her costume which only appears on very special occasions. Dot's second significant romance was built upon by scriptwriters in 2000 on the behest of producer John Yorke. Dot was paired romantically with pensioner Jim Branning, played by John Bardon and a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in December 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. The Guardian critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as \\"uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death do us part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most.\\" Bardon has revealed that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, \\"No way did the pair of us want to get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right.\\" Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had just suffered the death of her grandson Ashley (in which Nick had played a part), and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death \\"would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [but] with marrying Jim she gets a family ‚Äì that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again ‚Äì it will have a central point, they will be able to use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there.\\" Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to Coronation Street's Hilda and Stan Ogden, comparing a scene in EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: \\"Initially, Jim wasn't the sort of person that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied ‚Äì he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot ‚Äì heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around.\\" Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying \\"We work very well together ‚Äì he's got great timing and he can be very tender too.\\" The on-screen relationship between Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written out of the soap due to John Bardon suffering a major stroke. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and was placed in the care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: \\"Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that this is the end of Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again.\\" It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it, although ultimately this did not happen, as Bardon never recovered enough to make any further appearances. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, \\"I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important to tell this story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too ‚Äî not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life.\\" Jim died off-screen four years later, shortly after the death of actor John Bardon. Rose In May 2011, it was reported that Dot's estranged half-sister, Rose, would join the series, played by Polly Perkins. Reports stated that Dot and Rose fell out when the latter had an affair with the former's husband, Charlie, but Dot would decide to track Rose down after suffering a bout of hypochondria, feeling it is time to put things right, however, Rose will not be pleased to see Dot again after so many years. Friendships An enduring friendship featured in EastEnders was the one shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an \\"incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious\\".\\"Remembering EastEnders' Ethel\\", BBC. URL. Retrieved 24 October 2006. Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: \\"Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I caught a glimpse of her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out \\"Roll Out the Barrel\\". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel.\\" Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: \\"There was always one pretty and pert [Ethel], and always one in glasses [Dot].\\" Banks-Smith adds that theirs was \\"a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship.\\" Their bickering and personality differences were often used for comic effect; however, in episode 248 of the show, scriptwriter Colin Brake notes that viewers were shown a different side to Ethel and Dot's friendship in the soaps second two-hander episode. The episode aired in July 1987 and featured just the two old ladies. Brake has described the episode as a \\"mini- play about nostalgia and growing old\\", adding that \\"some viewers found it too unusual, but many others were charmed by the change of pace\\". According to Brake, the episode gave Franklin and Brown the opportunity to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Ethel and Dot. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show. Author Christine Geraghty has used the episode as an example of the fact that \\"female conversation is the backbone to traditional soap\\". Author Dorothy Hobson has discussed the use of older female characters in British soap opera as a means of providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in EastEnders to the trio of Ena Sharples, Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from Coronation Street with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of \\"'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series.\\" An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999. The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because \\"far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long- standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', there is a need for unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience.\\" Brown has spoken about the \\"wonderful rapport\\" she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, \\"I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed and it all went back to where it started.\\" Throughout her time in EastEnders, many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's launderette, where the character has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in EastEnders. Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Pauline Fowler, played by Wendy Richard from 1985 to 2006. Author Christine Geraghty has discussed the working environment the women inhabited, indicating that because the owner of the launderette is barely present, the \\"working relationship hinges on the friendships (or otherwise) of the women who work in it\\". As with Ethel, Dot and Pauline's friendship was often used for comedic purposes; emphasis was placed on their differences, leading to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 saw them \\"buried alive\\" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot were most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality Paul O'Grady as a \\"fabulous double-act\\": \\"Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else.\\" On the episode marking the screen death of Pauline on 25 December 2006, Dot remarks to Pauline, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only real friend I‚Äôve got\\", in a scene that Tim Teeman of The Times has described as \\"one of the most moving scenes in a soap [in 2006]\\". =1993 exit and 1997 return= In 1993, Brown decided to quit EastEnders after becoming \\"discontented\\" with the way Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: \\"I always felt Dot was one of those characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [but] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [Dot was hearing the gossip from others]. [Dot] was living on a reputation. [viewers] said to me, 'I loved it when [Dot] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up.\\" Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she \\"didn‚Äôt like what they were doing with Dot ‚Äì she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‚ÄòNo, this just won‚Äôt do‚Äô. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character.\\" The character departed on- screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent. In October 1996, newspapers reported that BBC bosses had approached Brown about reprising her role as Dot Cotton and, according to the Daily Mirror, Brown had been in negotiations with EastEnders for several months prior. Brown is quoted by the paper as saying, \\"I have always been reluctant to go back because I thought Dot's character was not being portrayed properly. I thought it had faded. I always said if Dot comes back it must be as Dot.\\" Brown secured a deal to return and began filming on-location in Gravesend in February 1997. The episode saw Dot's former lodger, Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), visiting Dot to discover that Nick was once again in prison, leaving Dot alone. Her return episode aired in April 1997. Brown has since revealed that she opted to return to EastEnders to raise her profile again. She had originally only intended to return for a 3-month stint, but was persuaded to stay when a project she had been working on was cancelled. In July 1997, she commented, \\"I've decided to stay in EastEnders. They asked me, and in the end I thought: 'Oh well, I might as well.' Everyone, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Adam Woodyatt, was saying: 'Don't leave'. And people were coming up in the street saying: 'It's lovely to have you back.' Anyway, I find playing the old dear quite fun.\\" After a 5-month break, following Dot being held hostage in her flat by the escaped convict friend of her son, Brown returned to filming in October 1997 on a permanent contract. =Issues= Euthanasia In 2000, Dot was featured in a storyline about euthanasia, when her oldest friend Ethel, who had terminal cancer, asked her to help her die. The storyline allowed the production team to present all sides of the debate about euthanasia, from the perspective of the sufferer and from the person who is asked to assist in the mercy killing, religious and moral opposition. According to author Dorothy Hobson, \\"Dot suffered torment as she struggled with her conscience and she tried to resist the request [...] to assist [Ethel] in the ultimate sin\\". In the storyline, Ethel enjoyed the last days of her life and chose her final evening. Assisted by Dot, she took an overdose of her medication and died.EastEnders airdate 7 September 2000 Written by Simon Ashton and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot \\"you're the best friend I ever had\\". Alternative credit music replaced the typical drum beats and theme tune at the end of the episode. The 1931 song used instead of the usual theme was \\"Guilty\\" by Al Bowlly. Ben Summerskill from The Observer has suggested that Dot's part in the euthanasia storyline was \\"one of the most moving dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV\\". The episode was voted the most emotional soap death in a Radio Times poll of 4,000 readers in 2006. The repercussions of the euthanasia for Dot's character have been described as \\"extremely serious\\" as she suffered from \\"untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action.\\" The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline, John Yorke, has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans: \\"Dot, as a good Christian, refused to help, until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation. Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person she could talk to [Jesus] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [it] to Graham Greene. While we felt a little uncomfortable in such exalted company, what it did show is that handled properly an audience is able to engage in, and relate to profound ethical debate.\\" Deborah Annetts, CEO of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (VES), has praised the storyline. In 2004 she commented, \\"It was a sympathetic portrayal. It demonstrated to a lot of people their own experiences. Lots of us have had conversations with someone, particularly our mothers and fathers, where they have said to us: 'If I get really ill, you will end it, won't you?' The Dot/Ethel storyline showed just what that conversation can entail and what happens to the other person after ‚Äì the guilt and pain they have to live with.\\" Such was the controversy surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot as part of their new approach to the study of British criminal law. Part of the law foundation course involves studying the soap opera and giving students the chance to decide if Dot Cotton's character is guilty of murder.\\"Pro-Life Times: November 2000\\", Society for the Protection of Unborn Children. Retrieved 24 October 2006. The storyline is also featured in GCSE Religious Studies textbooks. Kidney cancer In a 2004 plot, Dot was diagnosed with kidney cancer. The programme makers sought advice from health care professionals when devising the storyline, including specialist information nurses from CancerBACUP. Nurse Martin Ledwick said, \\"We drew on our experience of talking to the thousands of people who call our helpline, to help advise the EastEnders scriptwriters. Many people react to a cancer diagnosis as Dot does in the BBC serial ‚Äì with confusion and fear. We also speak to family and friends affected by the illness and those living with continuing uncertainty. EastEnders explores all these issues, and hopefully will help improve people's understanding of what it's like to be affected by a cancer diagnosis.\\" According to Macmillan Cancer Support, \\"Dot's experience [increased] people's understanding of the emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis; how the illness affects family and friends; and what it's like to live with uncertainty. It also [helped] to raise awareness of a comparatively rare cancer and the fact that cancer is a disease most often affecting older people.\\" Brown herself has confessed that she was unhappy with the storyline as she felt playing illness was not productive at her age. Discussing Dot's reluctance to reveal her illness to anyone, Brown said \\"[it's] ironic because I've played her as a hypochondriac, longing for attention, for 20 years. Now something's wrong, she doesn't want anyone to know.\\" Abandoned baby In the Easter 2007 episode, Dot takes an abandoned baby she finds in a church. This was filmed in Kent at Stansted, St. Giles Church in Wormshill, The Ringlestone Inn near Harrietsham and Court Lodge Farm. After being contacted by the child's Ukrainian mother Anya, Dot offers to care for both of them, however Jim turns Anya in to the authorities for being an illegal immigrant. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury questioned the plausibility of the storyline, observing: \\"Babies aren't abandoned in the real world very often. But you can barely cross [Albert] Square [...] without tripping over poor tots who their mothers don't want.\\" Laws also felt that the speed at which the immigration department operated was \\"amazingly on-the-ball\\", when in reality many illegal immigrants \\"slip through the net\\". =Monologue= In January 2008, Dot became the first soap opera character to be featured in a monologue episode, known as a \\"single-hander\\". Written by Tony Jordan, the episode features Dot recording a message for Jim, who is in hospital recovering from a stroke. The episode is entitled \\"Pretty Baby....\\", named after the song of the same name by Tony Jackson, which replaced the drumbeats and EastEnders' theme tune that typically accompanies the end credits of episodes. Brown was nominated in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards for her performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. =2020 departure= On 20 February 2020, it was reported that Dot's appearance on 21 January 2020 was her last and that Brown had announced that she would \\"never go back\\" when she told the Distinct Nostalgia podcast, \\"I don't want a retainer for EastEnders, I've left. I've left for good. I've sent her off to Ireland where she'll stay. I've left EastEnders.\\" A BBC statement said: \\"We never discuss artists' contracts, however as far as EastEnders are concerned the door remains open for June, as it always has if the story arises and if June wishes to take part.\\" It was also reported that Brown was due to attend a gathering of the cast and crew for the show's 35th anniversary in February 2020, that her dressing room was intact and that there were no plans, to the production team's knowledge, for Brown to leave the role permanently. Reception June Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal of Dot. According to author Pauline Frommer, Dot has been embraced by the viewing British population as a cultural archetype. Brown has suggested that Dot has universal appeal because everybody knows a person like Dot. In 2009, a poll by magazine Inside Soap named Dot as the UK's 'greatest gossip' in a soap opera. Brown was nominated for the 'Best Actress' BAFTA award for Dot's single-hander EastEnders episode in 2009; she became the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. The show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described Brown's BAFTA nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: \\"I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA ‚Äì of which I'm a member ‚Äì to connect with a big audience.\\" Brown has also won 'Best Actress' for her role as Dot at the Inside Soap Awards in 2001 and 2004, as well as the 'Outstanding Achievement' award in 2003, and 'Best Couple' in 2005 with John Bardon, as Dot and Jim Branning. She and Bardon also won 'Best On-Screen Partnership' at the British Soap Awards in both 2002 and 2005, while in 2005, Brown won a 'Lifetime Achievement' award for her role, again at the British Soap Awards. The role also resulted in several award nominations including a 'Most Popular Actress' nomination at the National Television Awards in 2005, and a 'Best Actress' nomination at the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards among others. Dot was also voted the 46th best television character in a television poll entitled The 100 Greatest Television Characters. At the time of the 2005 general election, Labour chiefs feared that an episode of EastEnders in which Dot learned to drive could distract viewers from voting. In the same year, Dot was criticised as revealing an anti-religious bias on the part of the BBC. Dr Indarjit Singh, editor of the Sikh Messenger and patron of the World Congress of Faiths suggested that Dot's endless quoting from the Bible served to ridicule religion. The character has been cited as an example of anti-Christian bias in the media. The BBC were accused of portraying Christians as old-fashioned in 2008 after an episode aired in which Dot asked a gay, male couple to stop kissing. The BBC responded, \\"EastEnders aims to reflect real life, and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities.\\" In a report to the BBC's Board of Governors in July 2004 regarding religion, Dot was used as an example of how religion can be portrayed as stereotypical \\"out-of-date and occasionally offensive\\" in drama and entertainment output, that Christian figures are highlighted because of their faith \\"rather than seen as normal people who also have a religious belief\\". It was suggested that some Christians think Dot \\"is made deliberately unappealing to audiences by her eccentric traits and hypocritical behaviour\\". However, it was also suggested that others think she is convincing. Brown's single-hander episode of EastEnders received much critical acclaim. The Guardian' Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Brown possibly the only member of the cast with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) capable of carrying such a monologue. Robert Hanks for The Independent wrote that \\"I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self- preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well.\\" Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times: \\"I know she‚Äôs a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night‚Äôs Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?\\" Teeman opined that: \\"Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill.\\" He deemed Dot a \\"soap icon\\", however he also assessed that: :This was a tour de force for sure ‚Äì but an indulgent one. It didn‚Äôt unlock anything substantially new to Dot. [...] Far from making us care more about Dot ‚Äì we do anyway, it was preaching to the converted ‚Äì it was a little, well, dull. Boring even. [...] [T]he episode revealed a nagging weakness: Coronation Street has a fine repertory of older characters and actors which gives the show its wonderful link to the past. In EastEnders, the same gatekeeping roles are played by Dot and Ian Beale: she is a jewel but, as she said, an all-too lonely one. Cherish her, absolutely, but don‚Äôt turn her into a drag act. The Daily Telegraph's Gerard O'Donovan agreed that \\"June Brown, as Dot, was mesmerising\\", but was similarly critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: \\"Overall [...] the feeling couldn‚Äôt be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing. Had it been a swan song, it would have been a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off.\\" Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7 million viewers, compared to 9.4 million watching EastEnders the previous week. A 2003 episode centred around Dot also resulted in a notable ratings slump. The New Year episode, which detailed her childhood evacuation to the countryside, received just 8.1 million viewers, compared with 12.2m the previous evening and 16m on Christmas Day. Prior to this, however, a 2002 two-hander episode featuring just Dot and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) was watched by 11.5 million viewers, with an almost 60% share of viewers in the timeslot. In popular culture The character of Dot Branning has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show 2DTV. She was also impersonated by Alistair McGowan in his television series Big Impression. As part of the sketch, Dot and her son Nick were morphed into a version of the sitcom duo Steptoe and Son. McGowan stated in 2001 that Dot was his favourite impression, because he \\"looks a bit like her\\". Dot's old-fashioned style of dress has been likened to the clothing collection of Prada's designer, Miuccia Prada. Dot has been said to have inspired clothing, hairstyles and has been quoted by various fashion professionals as a style icon. She has also inspired catwalk themes, such as that of aspiring designer Hollie Luxton in 2007, who stated, \\"I wanted to capture the nostalgia of the bygone days and play with the idea of clothing coming out of the wash misshapen and faded.\\" Dot's long- suffering luckless life has also led to her being labelled as a gay icon by Tim Lusher of the Evening Standard. The monthly Dot Cotton Club, a gay club night in Cambridge, is named in her honour. Dot is a notable smoker on British television as she regularly appears on-screen smoking. The character is so synonymous with smoking that the term \\"Dot Cotton syndrome\\" is used within the health industry to: \\"describe the elderly population who continue to smoke heavily without registering the health problems they are or will soon suffer from, seeing it as their only pleasure left in life\\". Impressionist Francine Lewis performed an impression of Dot Cotton in the seventh series of Britain's Got Talent. During 2003, a promotional advertisement for the BBC featuring a character, Fizz, from the children's television programme The Tweenies pulling off a mask and morphing into Dot received complaints. Parents complained that their children were having nightmares and the BBC subsequently moved back the screening times. In the BBC drama Line of Duty one of the prominent detectives in series 1‚Äì3, Matthew Cottan, is nicknamed 'Dot'.

It has a crab stick factory which exports to many countries in Europe.  History  Plungƒó belfry St. Florian St. John the Baptist Church It is thought that the territory in which Plungƒó is situated was inhabited in 5th‚Äì1st centuries BC. After the Treaty of Melno country seats were established in the forests of Samogitia. From the 14th century to the middle of the 16th century, Plungƒó was a part of Gandinga volost as an ordinary settlement. Later, the population of Plungƒó started to grow faster and surpassed the population of Gandinga. In 1567 Plungƒó was mentioned as a town. On January 13, 1792, Plungƒó was granted Magdeburg rights. From 1806 to 1873 Plungƒó belonged to Platon Zubov, and later ‚Äì to Oginskiai, who built a palace here in 1879. During the interwar period there was established gymnasium in 1925 and built railway branch-line in 1932. In 1933 current Catholic Church was consecrated. Since the private hospital was founded in 1939, maternity, surgical sections started their activities. Lithuanian Jews were active in the town's government and comprised around half of Plungƒó's inhabitants leading up to The Holocaust in Lithuania. During the 1941 June Uprising in Lithuania and the German invasion as part of Operation Barbarossa, Plungƒó was captured by German forces on 25 June 1941. Lithuanian nationalists, led by Jonas Noreika,‚ÄûDie M√∂rder werden noch gebraucht‚Äú, Der Spiegel, Von Leonid Olschwang, 23 April 1984She thought her grandfather was a Lithuanian hero. Research leads her to ask, was he a patriot or a Nazi?, Chicago Tribune, Ron Grossman, 14 January 2019 seized control and formed a town administration and police force. German forces killed 60 young Jewish men, accused by the Lithuanians of being a rear guard for the Red Army, shortly after the town's capture. On 26 June 1941, the day after the Germans' arrival in Plungƒó, Lithuanian forces moved the town's Jews into a makeshift ghetto, while carrying out beatings, torture, murders and forcing Jews to perform heavy labor. On 13 or 15 July in the Plungƒó massacre, the Lithuanian nationalists transported Jewish men, women and children to ditches near the village of Kausenai where they were shot. Of the 1,700 Jews living in Plungƒó in 1939, very few survived and those who were often victims of the Soviet deportations from Lithuania prior to the Holocaust.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945, Geoffrey P. Megargee, Martin C. Dean, and Mel Hecker, Volume II, part B, pages 1105. Remembrance sites for the events of 1941 exist in and around the town. The Jewish holocaust survivor and sculptor Jacob Bunka was one of the town's few Jews to survive the war. During the years of the independence of Lithuania Plungƒó's economic was based on the factory of fibre flax and cotton Kuƒçiskis ‚Äì Pabedinskiai and also on the activities of Jewish businessmen and agricultural products made by Samogitian farmers. After World War II and the Soviet occupation, Plungƒó started to grow rapidly ‚Äì if the city had 7,400 inhabitants in 1950, in 1990 it had already had 23,300 inhabitants. During the years of Soviet occupation, Lithuanians became the majority of city's inhabitants. According to Government's Resolution of 1963, Plungƒó should have become regional centre with a strong industry. However these plans were ruined when it became obvious that the city doesn't have enough water resources although some high level companies representing various branches of industry were established in Plungƒó. Most of these companies however bankrupted after the Independence of Lithuania was announced. The coat of arms of Plungƒó was affirmed by the decree of the President on June 6, 1997. In 2009 Plungƒó was elected Lithuanian Capital of Culture. Nowadays Plungƒó is the sixteenth largest city of Lithuania having 22,287 inhabitants. =Name= Origin of the name Plungƒó is not clear enough. The most persuasive theory is that the name of the city is issued from the name of river Paplunga which flowed through the city. The city's name is P≈Çungiany in Polish, Plongƒó in Samogitian, Plungyan (◊§◊ú◊ï◊†◊í◊ô◊ê◊ü) in Yiddish. It was also called –ü–ª—É–Ω–≥—è–Ω—ã (Plungyany) in Russian in the past.http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle.fullcontentlink:pdfeventlink/$002fj$002fwerk.2014.9.issue-2$002fwerk-2014-0008$002fwerk-2014-0008.pdf?t:ac=j$002fwerk.2014.9.issue-2$002fwerk-2014-0008$002fwerk-2014-0008.xml  Main sights  * Plungƒó Manor * Plungƒó District Municipal Public Library * Plungƒó park * St. John the Baptist Church * St. Florian's sculpture Transport Plungƒó Railway Station Fountain at central square Plungƒó Public Library Important highways are built near the city: *Highway A11 ≈†iauliai‚ÄìPalanga *Highway 164 Ma≈æeikiai‚ÄìPlungƒó‚ÄìTauragƒó *Highway 166 Plungƒó‚ÄìVƒó≈æaiƒçiai Plungƒó also has railway station.

He was born in Montalegre, Vila Real District, in the North of Portugal. Not much is known about his childhood. In 1915 he became an apprentice mechanical turner in Lisbon. Four years later, in 1919 he started doing the same work in the arsenal of the Portuguese navy in Alfeite. In 1922 he joined the navy and one year later he started the elementary pilot course. In 1924 he was sent to the Portuguese colony of Angola and started to work as a mechanical turner in the Luanda railroad company. He became there an activist, trying to organize the Union of the Luanda's Workers. In 1926 he returned to Lisbon, where he became a member of the Navy Workers Labor Union, in the next year he traveled to Moscow, in the Portuguese delegation to the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. In September 1928 he joined the Portuguese Communist Party and became a member of the cell of the Arsenal of Alfeite. In 1929 he participated in the reorganizative conference of the Communist Party and was elected to the provisional Central Commission. Soon after, he became Secretary General. In 1930 he was arrested by the political police of the Estado Novo regime and was forced to live in the Azores. One year later he was transferred to Portuguese Cape Verde. In 1933 he returned to Portugal and went underground. In November of the same year he traveled to Madrid where he established contacts with the Comintern and the Communist Party of Spain. In 1935, Bento Gon√ßalves participated in the 7th Congress of the Comintern. Soon after returning to Portugal he was arrested again by the political police. After that he was transferred to a prison in the Azores where he was put on trial by a military court for his communist activities. In the end of the year he was transferred to the prison camp in Tarrafal, where he died of sickness in 1942. In the Avante!

Early life and career Slater, the son of John Slater (Samuel Slater's brother and partner), was born in Slatersville, Rhode Island (now a village within North Smithfield) in 1815 where his family was active in Slatersville Congregational Church and owned the local textile mills and village. John F. Slater was educated in academies at Plainfield, Connecticut, and Wrentham and Wilbraham, Massachusetts. At seventeen he entered his father's woollen mill in Hopeville, Conn., of which he took charge in 1836. This and other mills he owned in partnership with his brother, William S Slater, until 1873, when his brother took over the Slatersville Mills and he assumed sole ownership of the mills at Jewett City. In 1842 he removed from Jewett City to Norwich; there he helped to endow the Norwich Free Academy, to which his son presented the Slater Memorial Museum. Slater also endowed Park Congregational Church in Norwich and donated Slater Library. Slater died on May 7, 1884, and his funeral was held at Park Congregational Church, which he had attended.Memorial 1885, p.15 Philanthropy In 1882 he donated $1,000,000 to a board of ten trustees, incorporated in New York state, for the uplifting of the lately emancipated population of the Southern states, and their posterity, by conferring on them the benefits of Christian education. Among the original trustees of the Slater Fund were Rutherford B Hayes, Morrison R Waite, William E Dodge, Phillips Brooks, Daniel Coit Gilman, Morris Ketchum Jesup and the donor's son, William A. Slater; and among members chosen later were Melville W Fuller, William E Dodge, Jr, Henry Codman Potter, Cleveland H Dodge and Seth Low. In 1909 by careful investment the fund had increased, in spite of expenditures, to more than $1,500,000. The fund was of great value in aiding industrial schools in the South, its largest beneficiaries being the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute of Hampton, Virginia, the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute of Tuskegee, Alabama, Spelman Seminary in Atlanta, Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina, and Fisk University, in Nashville, Tennessee. At Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is the Slater State Normal and Industrial School, founded in 1892 and named after the founder of the fund; it is now part of Winston-Salem State University. Other state normal schools for African Americans received assistance from the fund, as did some Southern urban school boards. Other John Fox Slater House The John Fox Slater House in Norwich, Connecticut is another legacy. His son William A. Slater presented the Slater Memorial Museum to Norwich Free Academy in memory of his father. The John Fox Slater Elementary School in Washington, D.C., now closed, was named in his honor. The building is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Biography  Son of Umbertina Santi, a seamstress, and Raffaele Costantino Edoardo, known as Ettore, himself a tailor who died in combat against the Germans on the island of Cephalonia in 1943, Luigi Ballerini was born in Milan and grew up in the district of Porta Ticinese. Since 2010, he has divided his time between New York, Milan, and Otranto. He studied literature at the Universit√† Cattolica in Milan, lived for a time in London, and graduated from Bologna with a thesis on the American writer, Charles Olson. His first poems, Inno alla terra, debuted in Inventario in 1960. In 1963, he began working on the editorial staff of Rizzoli, sending to print the Italian translation of Foucault‚Äôs Madness and Civilization. In 1965, he moved to Rome, where he met neo-experimental artists and poets such as Adriano Spatola, Giulia Niccolai, Nanni Cagnone, Eliseo Mattiacci, Magdalo Mussio, Emilio Villa, Alfredo Giuliani, Giovanna Sandri and, in particular, Elio Pagliarani, with whom he became a collaborator. Through Pagliarani, he met the founder of publisher Marsilio Editori, Cesare De Michelis, with whom he maintained a deep friendship. Through Marsilio, he published his first volume of literary criticism (Ila piramide capovolta, 1975), La sacra Emilia, an anthology of selected poetry by Gertrude Stein, which he translated himself, and several poetry collections (Il terzo gode, 1993, and the reissue of Cefalonia 1943-2001, in 2013). Meanwhile, he wrote book reviews in the newspapers Avanti! and l‚ÄôUnit√†, and the journal Rinascita; he taught in secondary schools; and he translated American critics and writers such as Lionel Abel, Leslie Fiedler, Herman Melville, Benjamin Franklin, James Baldwin, and Henry James. In 1971, for the publisher Guanda, he translated Kora in Hell by William Carlos Williams. Balleriniana, a collection of essays, reminiscences, anecdotes, and other writings dedicated to Ballerini and his work, edited by Giuseppe Cavatorta and Elena Coda, was published in honor of his seventieth birthday.  The American Years  He moved to Los Angeles in 1969 and taught modern and contemporary Italian literature at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This was not, however, his first experience in the United States (from 1960 to 1962, he had studied at Wesleyan University in Connecticut). The following year his son, the actor Edoardo Ballerini, was born. He moved to New York in 1971 to teach at City College and at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY). In 1972, his first poetry collection, eccettera. E, was issued (Guanda). He became chair of Italian studies at New York University (NYU) in 1976, and in 1990, for a brief period, director of the Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim√≤. This post led him to assume that of chair of Italian at UCLA in 1992. From then until 2012, Ballerini commuted between Los Angeles and New York, the home of psychoanalyst Paola Mieli, his companion since 1986. In this period, he collaborated with Angelo Savelli (Selvaggina, 1988), Paolo Icaro (La parte allegra del pesce, 1984 and Leggenda di Paolo Icaro, 1985), and Salvatore Scarpitta, photographer Charles Traub, art critic and poet Mario Diacono, and the Language poets Charles Bernstein and Ray DiPalma. He met and collaborated with critic and writer Marjorie Perloff, poet and translator Paul Vangelisti, sculptor Richard Nonas, and composer Jed Distler, for whose opera, Tools, Ballerini wrote the libretto. During these years, he was the promoter of Italian poetry and culture in exhibits (Italian Visual Poetry 1912-1972 at the Finch Museum of New York and the Turin Civic Gallery and Spelt from Sybil's Leaves at the Power Gallery of Sydney), and at conferences and meetings (The Disappearing Pheasant I in New York in 1991 and, in Los Angeles, The Disappearing Pheasant II in 1994 and La lotta con Proteo in 1997).  Poetry and Poetics  Sixteen years after publication of eccetera. E (republished by Edizioni Diaforia of Viareggio with an introductory essay by Cecilia Bello Minciacchi and contributions by Remo Bodei, Giulia Niccolai, and Adriano Spatola), Ballerini wrote Che figurato muore (All‚Äôinsegna del pesce d‚Äôoro imprint of publisher Vanni Scheiwiller), followed by Che oror l‚Äôorient (Lubrina, 1991), a collection of Milanese poems and translation into Milanese dialect of the thirteenth-century poems of Guido Cavalcanti, for which he won the . The subsequent collection, Il terzo gode, was published in 1994. Shakespearian Rags, published in 1996 by Roman publisher Quasar, was written in English with facing text translated into Italian by the author (Stracci shakesperiani), with an introduction by Filippo Bettini. This was followed by Uno monta la luna (Manni, 2001) and his best known work, Cefalonia 1943-2001 (Mondadori, 2005), for which he won the Brancati Prize and the Lorenzo Montano Prize for Poetry. A complete collection of his poetry, edited by Beppe Cavatorta, was published in 2016 by Mondadori. Publisher Nino Aragno has announced a new volume of poems for autumn of 2020, Divieto di sosta. The trajectory of Ballerini's poetry can be clearly divided into three phases. The first is apprenticeship, the second an oracular phase and, thirdly, a consistent series of ‚Äúdeveloped subjects‚Äù in which an unrenounced narrative aim is ‚Äúled astray‚Äù by stimuli inherent in the language in which it is manifested. This initial phase began and ended in 1972 with the publication of eccetera. E, in which Ballerini brought to bear lessons of the Neoavanguardia and which reflected Pagliarani's influence. The second phase is characterized by extreme conciseness of conversational material. In latest phase, encompassing works between approximately 1994 and 2020, a rational function takes effect. Many texts are organized as a succession of apodoses and protases, as polysyndetic catalogues and with de-pragmaticizing appositions. ‚ÄúRather than beheading meaning,‚Äù writes Cavatorta in the introduction to the Oscar Mondadori edition, ‚Äúone must speak of liberation, because without this transformation, one remains trapped in the consoling slavery of a deceitfully confessional ego.‚Äù Ballerini mixes sectorial and foreign languages (living and dead), and idiomatic and vernacular expressions. Rich in literary references, his poetry is rife with straightforward as well as parodic quotations from both high literature (Shakespeare, Dante, the Dolce Stil Novo, Ezra Pound, etc.) and popular ballads and songs. His lexicon includes borrowings -- perversely turned inside-out ‚Äì from sketches of Italian variety shows.  Work as a Critic  As a critic, Ballerini has worked principally in the fields of medieval poetry, Futurism, and contemporary poetry and art. The first includes essays on Cavalcanti and the Dolce Stil Novo. With regard to Futurism, he produced two editions of the Filippo Tommaso Marinetti‚Äôs novels, Gli indomabili [The Untameables] (Mondadori, 2000) and Mafarka il futurista [Mafarka the Futurist] (Mondadori, 2003). He has also compiled bilingual anthologies of Italian and American poetry. Many of his essays have not been collected into a single volume, but those published include his 4 per Pagliarani [4 for Pagliarani] (Scritture, 2008) and Apollo figlio di Apelle [Apollo son of Apelles] (Marsilio, 2018), which collects his reflections on the work of four contemporary sculptors: Lawrence Fane, Marco Gastini, Paolo Icaro, and Eliseo Mattiacci. Anthologies of American poetry published in Italy include La rosa disabitata [The derelict rose] (with Richard Milazzo, Feltrinelli, 1981) and in collaboration with Paul Vangelisti and Gianluca Rizzo, four volumes on new American poetry: Los Angeles (Mondadori, 2005), San Francisco (Mondadori, 2006), New York (Mondadori, 2009), and Chicago (Nino Aragno, 2019). Anthologies of Italian poetry published in the United States include: Shearsmen of sorts (Forum Italicum, 1992), The Promised Land (Sun and Moon Press, 1999), and the volumes of Those Who from afar Look like Flies (University of Toronto Press, 2017), edited in collaboration with Beppe Cavatorta and dedicated to the research poetry and poetic criticism of the late twentieth century, from the mid 1950s (the years of Officina and Il Verri) to 2015.  New Translation of Spoon River  For his version of Herman Melville‚Äôs Benito Cereno (Marsilio, 2012), Ballerini sought to rework the lexical and syntactic angularity of his predecessors and translated, as he writes in a note to the text, not so much with Italian but in Italian‚Äîthat is, respecting the stylistic and rhetorical demands of the target language (Italian) in a way that does justice to the original's lucidity: Melville's ‚Äúwise men,‚Äù for example, becomes ‚Äúquelli che se ne intendono.‚Äù In 2016, through Mondadori, he published a new translation of Spoon River Anthology by Edgar Lee Masters, which had become famous in Italy through the joint action of Cesare Pavese and Fernanda Pivano. Based on the critical edition produced by John Hallwas, the new edition includes a historical-literary essay highlighting the political and cultural circumstances that prevailed at the time of the work's birth and development around 1914. The notes to this edition give a face to the fictitious characters and a realistic dimension to the locations where their actions take place. Particular attention is given to the phenomenon of the development of middle-class values in what had previously been primarily a society of farmers and breeders in Illinois.  Editorial Work  In 1975, in New York, Ballerini founded OOLP (Out of London Press), with which he published titles dedicated to art criticism and research poetry. In 1988, he was Marsilio's editor for the United States, and in 2003, with ambassador Gianfranco Facco-Bonetti, head of cultural services of Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he created the Lorenzo Da Ponte Italian Library ‚Äî a series of classics of Italian culture in the fields of history, jurisprudence, political science, literature, linguistics, and philosophy, published by University of Toronto Press. In the same period, with Beppe Cavatorta, Gianluca Rizzo, and Federica Santini, he created Agincourt Press, which published texts of experimental poetry, essays on Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis, and philosophy. Gastronomic Studies Ballerini has worked with the history of Italian gastronomy, which became the subject of his teaching at UCLA between 2005 and 2008[25]. In 2003, he published, with his own introductory essay, the first complete edition in English of Pellegrino Artusi‚Äôs, Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well (University of Toronto Press). In 2004, he published (through University of California Press) the Book of the Culinary Art by Maestro Martino, the first chef of the modern era, whose work, identified only in 1931, dates to the second half of the fifteenth century. An edition of the Italian original, Libro de arte coquinaria, based on four of the five existing manuscripts and edited by Ballerini and Jeremy Parzen, was published by Guido Tommasi Editore in 2001. Since 2012, he has created a series of meetings entitled ‚ÄúLatte e Linguaggio‚Äù [Milk and Language]. These rendezvous have taken place in the former dairy (and now municipal library) Chiesa Rossa in Milan. His book Erbe da mangiare (recipes by Ada De Santis, plates by Giuliano Della Casa) was issued by Mondadori in 2008 and republished in March 2020. An English translation, A Feast of Weeds, was published by University of California Press in 2012. For many years, he has been interested the pairing of food and the visual arts, with particular attention to canvases of convivial and religious subjects painted during the Renaissance.

He is best known for paintings in pulp magazines, paperbacks, men's adventure magazines, comic books and trading cards. On occasion, Saunders signed his work with his middle name, Blaine. Biography =Early life and career= Saunders was born in Minot, North Dakota, but his earliest memories were from the family's homestead near Bemidji in northern Minnesota where he and his parents lived in a one-room cabin. He recalled moving north at age seven, to Roseau County on the Canada‚ÄìUS border, where his father was a game warden and a touring Presbyterian minister. \\"A tribe of the Chippewa Indians were there and by the time I was 12, was practically a blood brother.\\" Saunders' career was launched when his contributions to Captain Billy's Whiz Bang resulted in a job with Fawcett Publications, where he was employed from 1928 to 1934. He explained in 1983 the events that led to his arrival at Fawcett's offices in Robbinsdale, Minnesota: =Pulp paintings= Norman Saunders' cover for Marvel Science Stories April‚ÄìMay 1939. He left Fawcett to become a freelance pulp artist, moved to New York City and studied under Harvey Dunn at the Grand Central School of Art. He painted for all the major publishers and was known for his fast-action scenes, his beautiful women and his ability to meet a deadline. He worked in almost any genre--Westerns, weird menace, detective, sports and the saucy pulps (sometimes signed as \\"Blaine\\"). He was able to paint very quickly, producing 100 paintings a year--two a week from 1935 through 1942--and thus lived well during the Depression era. During World War II, Saunders served with the Military Police overseeing German prisoners. Transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers, he supervised the construction of a gas pipeline following the Burma Road. During his off hours, he painted watercolors of Burmese temples. =Trading cards= In 1958, Saunders obtained his first assignment from the trading cards company Topps, painting over photographs of baseball players who had been traded, so that they would appear to be wearing the jersey of their new team . Topps soon employed Saunders to create artwork for many other cards, including the 1962 Mars Attacks series and the Batman TV series in 1966.17 collectible sets based on classic tv shows on MeTV.com Product developer Len Brown, inspired by Wally Wood's cover for EC Comics' Weird Science #16, pitched the idea to art director Woody Gelman. Wood fleshed out his and Gelman's initial sketches, and Bob Powell did the final designs. Saunders painted the 55-card set.Stewart, Bhob and Len Brown. \\"The Bubble Gum Years\\", Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2003). p. 150 The cards were test marketed by Topps through a dummy corporation called Bubbles, Inc. under the name Attack From Space. Sales were sufficient to expand the marketing, and the name was changed to Mars Attacks. The cards sparked parental and community outrage over their graphic violence and implied sexuality. Topps responded initially by repainting 13 of the cards to reduce the gore and sexuality; then, following inquiries from a Connecticut district attorney, Topps agreed to halt production. Saunders also produced a number of less well known trading-card series, including Ugly Stickers, Nutty Initials, Make Your Own Name Stickers and Civil War News. Wacky Packages was Norman Saunders' last major art project, and also his biggest popular success. He began them in 1967 with the \\"die-cuts\\" and he continued to paint them until the 16th series in 1976. Although, Norm created no new art for the \\"Wackies\\" after 1978, the manufacturers continued to repackage Norm's artworks in various formats, even releasing some previously unreleased artworks, but the last Topps product with Norm's art was the Wacky Can Labels in 1980.

He was descended from Edward Jessup of the Stamford, New Haven Colony, an early settler in Middleburg, Long Island, now Elmhurst, Queens. Edward later became owner of a large estate in what is now Hunts Point, Bronx. In 1854 Morris married Maria van Antwerp DeWitt (1834‚Äì1914). He died at home in New York City in 1908, and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. =Business career= In 1842 he went to New York City, where after some experience in business, he established a banking house in 1852. In 1856 he organized the banking firm of MK Jesup & Company, which after two reorganizations became Cuyler, Morgan & Jesup. He became widely known as a financier, retiring from active business in 1884. =Philanthropy= Before his retirement, he was already active in a wide variety of philanthropic endeavors. Jesup was one of the organizers of the United States Christian Commission during the Civil War, which helped provide care for wounded soldiers. He was one of the founders of YMCA New York, and served as its president in New York in 1872. After 1860 he helped found and served as president of the Five Points House of Industry in New York, a type of settlement house in Lower Manhattan to teach new European immigrants the skills needed in the United States. In 1881, he became president of the New York City Mission and Tract Society. He donated the funds for construction of the Society's DeWitt (his father-in-law) Memorial Church in Rivington Street on the Lower East Side, a center of immigrant settlement. Jesup contributed funds and worked personally to better social conditions in New York, in a period when the city was struggling to aid many poor immigrants from rural areas of southern and eastern Europe, including the Russian Empire. The Woman's Hospital in New York City received $100,000. He was best known as a patron of scientific research: Jesup was a major contributor to fund the Arctic expeditions of Robert Peary. He was elected president of the Peary Arctic Club in 1899. Jesup also funded the Jesup North Pacific Expedition (1897-1902), a major ethnographic project led by the anthropologist Franz Boas. He was also an important patron and collector of the visual arts, perhaps best remembered for his support of Frederic Edwin Church, which resulted in the 1871 masterwork The Parthenon that came into the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Jesup's substantial bequest of many important paintings of the Hudson River School and more at the time of his wife's death in 1915.https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10482 Jesup contributed to educational institutions. His contributions to Tuskegee Institute enabled George Washington Carver to develop a mobile educational station that he took to farmers. Jesup was treasurer of the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen at its beginning. He served as a member of the Peabody Educational Board and of the General Education Board. He gave $51,000 to the Yale Divinity School; to Yale University, he gave the Landbery Arabic manuscripts, for which he had paid $20,000. Williams College received $35,000. He presented Jesup Hall to the Union Theological Seminary. In 1881, he was appointed president of the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, to which he gave large sums in his lifetime and bequeathed $1,000,000. In 1883 he became chairman of the newly formed Forestry Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce, tasked with \\"saving the woods and waters of the State [i.e.New York],\\" an early step in a process that eventually led to the creation of New York State's Adirondack Park in 1894. Jesup also served as trustee for the Syrian Protestant College (American University of Beirut) from 1884 to 1892, and board chair from 1893 to 1908. He also built \\"Post Hall\\", which is home to the university's Archaeological Museum and Geology Department. Jesup was president of the New York Chamber of Commerce from 1899 until 1907, and was the largest subscriber to its new building. Jesup was a member of the Jekyll Island Club (aka The millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia along with J.P. Morgan and William Rockefeller among others. To his native town he donated funds to construct the Westport Public Library. He died in New York City on 22 January 1908, aged 77.

In 2001 TWA was merged into American Airlines. A smaller regional airline that used the Ozark name (and whose operating certificate was purchased by Great Plains Airlines) operated in 2000‚Äì2001. From 1950 until 1986 Ozark's headquarters was located at St. Louis Lambert International Airport.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. March 30, 1985. 105. History The dark green Ozark Air Lines logo Another Ozark Air Lines logo On 1 September 1943 Ozark Air Lines was founded to fly services from Springfield, Missouri, and in January 1945 it began flights between Springfield and St. Louis on Beech 17 Staggerwings, replaced by Cessna AT-17 Bobcat in the late 1940s. The required license from the Civil Aeronautics Board was not forthcoming and operations had to stop. In July 1950 Ozark was granted a certificate to operate Parks Air Transport routes not previously activated. Services were started on 26 September 1950 using Douglas DC-3s from St. Louis to Chicago, Tulsa and Memphis. In 1955 the airline had 13 DC-3s flying to 35 cities between Sioux City, Indianapolis, Wichita, and Nashville. Ozark's main hub was St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Like other Local Service airlines, it was subsidized; in 1962 its operating \\"revenues\\" of $14.0 million included $4.5 million of federal subsidy.Moody's Transportation Manual 1964 In 1960 turboprop Fairchild F-27s were introduced; piston-engine Martin 4-0-4s were added to the fleet in 1964 and removed in 1967. One of 3 co-founders, Arthur G. Heyne was an attorney in St. Louis, MO, and served as Secretary-Treasurer starting in 1950. =Jets= Fairchild- Hiller FH-227B at Chicago O'Hare Airport in 1975 In 1961 Ozark's network reached from Minneapolis to Nashville and from Kansas City to Indianapolis and Louisville. Denver was added in 1966 and in 1969 the network sprouted eastward: Ozark was awarded nonstops from Champaign and Peoria to Washington Dulles, continuing to New York LaGuardia. Atlanta was added in 1978 and four Florida cities in winter 1978-79.Ozark Douglas DC-9-31 at O'Hare in 1975 In September 1966 Ozark and Central Airlines announced plans to merge, subject to CAB approval; the new airline was to retain the Ozark name and would be one of the largest local service carriers in the U.S. However, in November 1966, the two airlines announced that merger talks had ended by mutual consent for undisclosed reasons. By 1967 the Martins and F-27s were replaced with Fairchild Hiller FH-227s, a stretched F-27; Ozark was all-turbine after the last DC-3 flight in October 1968. Ozark's first jets were Douglas DC-9-10s in July 1966. The DC-9-10s were augmented with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s (DC-9-31/32) and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-40s; the airline ordered two Boeing 727-200s but never took delivery. Ozark went all-DC-9 in 1980 and in 1984 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s were added. The three swallows on Ozark fins represented on-time flights, referring to the legend of the swallows that return to the Mission of San Juan Capistrano, in California, each year on the 19th of March. =Merger with TWA= In the mid-1980s Ozark and TWA had a de facto duopoly at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, a hub for both. Ozark accounted for 26.3 percent of boardings at STL in 1985, while TWA accounted for 56.6 percent. On March 1, 1986 the two airlines announced plans to merge: TWA would buy Ozark for $242 million in cash. Shareholders of both airlines approved the merger by late summer, and the U.S. Department of Transportation gave its approval on September 12, 1986. Ozark ceased to exist as an independent company on October 27, 1986. The Ozark DC-9s were gradually painted with a modified paint scheme with \\"TWA\\" in the tail. Over the next couple of years, the fifty Ozark airplanes were repainted in the TWA livery. On December 1, 2001, TWA was merged into American Airlines. =Second Ozark Air Lines (2000‚Äì2001)= In 1998 rights to the airline's name were purchased by William E. Stricker of Columbia, Missouri. The reformed Ozark Air Lines received its operating certificate on February 11, 2000, and began service 10 days later, from Columbia Regional Airport to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago Midway Airport, using two Fairchild Dornier 328JET aircraft. A year later the company ceased operations and sold its assets to the now-bankrupt Great Plains Airlines, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Sales and marketing =Reservations= From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Ozark Air Lines' reservations department used a special toll-free WX telephone prefix in New Jersey which could be reached only in certain areas of the state by dialing 0 and asking the New Jersey Bell operator to connect to Ozark's WX number: WX-8300. The number could not be dialed directly by the customer and was only available to certain telephone exchanges where WX was available. (Direct-dial toll-free service made WX numbers obsolete, and they have been largely phased out.) =Advertising= In the late 1960s comedian George Carlin appeared in Ozark advertising.

Eliot. She was a major stockholder in the publishing firm of Faber and Faber Limited and the editor and annotator of a number of books dealing with her late husband's writings. Biography The daughter of an insurance manager in Leeds, she was educated at Queen Anne's School, Caversham, where she was reputed to have told her headteacher that she knew precisely what she wanted to become: secretary to T.S. Eliot. Valerie married Eliot, almost 40 years her senior, on 10 January 1957.Esty, Jed (2002). \\"Modern American Poetry: An Online Journal and Multimedia Companion to Anthology of Modern American Poetry\\". Oxford University Press, 2000, accessed 20 January 2007. She had been a star-struck fan of Eliot since her schooldays, as she confided to the novelist Charles Morgan, for whom she worked as a secretary. Morgan used his influence to get her a job at Faber and Faber, where she finally met Eliot in August 1949, a debt of kindness which she always acknowledged. In a 1994 interview with The Independent, she recalled a very ordinary life of evenings spent at home playing Scrabble and eating cheese, stating \\"He obviously needed a happy marriage. He wouldn't die until he'd had it.\\" Following T.S. Eliot's 1965 death, Valerie was his most important editor and literary executor, having brought to press The Waste Land: Facsimile and Manuscripts of the Original Drafts (1971) and The Letters of T.S. Eliot: Volume 1, 1898‚Äì1922 (1989). She assisted Christopher Ricks with his edition of The Inventions of the March Hare (1996), a volume of Eliot's unpublished verse. A long-delayed second volume of T.S. Eliot's letters was also edited by her.Christensen, Karen. \\"Dear Mrs Eliot...\\", The Guardian, 29 January 2005. One of Valerie Eliot's most lucrative decisions as executor was granting permission for a stage musical to be based on her husband's work Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. This became the hit Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats. With her portion of the proceeds Valerie Eliot established \\"Old Possum's Practical Trust\\" ‚Äì a literary registered charity ‚Äì and funded the T.S. Eliot Prize, given annually and worth ¬£15,000.

It features series regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Terry Scott, Hattie Jacques, Barbara Windsor, Bernard Bresslaw and Peter Butterworth. Plot Sid Boggle (Sid James) and his friend Bernie Lugg (Bernard Bresslaw) are partners in a plumbing business. They take their girlfriends, prudish Joan Fussey (Joan Sims) and meek Anthea Meeks (Dilys Laye), to the cinema to see a film about a nudist camp called Paradise. Sid has the idea of the group holidaying there, reasoning that in that environment their heretofore chaste girlfriends will relax their strict moral standards. Sid easily gains Bernie's co-operation in the scheme, which they attempt to keep secret from the girls. They travel to the campsite named Paradise. After paying the membership fees to the owner, money-grabbing farmer Josh Fiddler (Peter Butterworth), Sid realises it is not the camp seen in the film, but merely a standard family campsite. To add to their disappointment, it is no paradise but instead, a damp field; the only facilities being a very basic toilet and a washing block. They reluctantly agree to stay there after Fiddler refuses a refund and the girls approve of the place. There is further disappointment when the girls will not share a tent with the boys. Sid and Bernie soon set their sights on a bunch of young ladies on holiday from the Chayste Place finishing school. The ringleader of the girls is blonde and bouncy Babs (Barbara Windsor). In charge of the girls is Dr. Soaper (Kenneth Williams), who is fervently pursued by his lovelorn colleague, the school's matron, Miss Haggard (Hattie Jacques). The girls soon leave for Ballsworth Youth Hostel, where Babs and her friend Fanny (Sandra Caron) change the room numbers on Dr. Soaper's and Miss Haggard's doors and convince Dr. Soaper that the female washroom, where Miss Haggard is, is the male washroom. Dr Soaper leads an outdoor aerobics session, during which Babs' bikini top flies off; he catches it. Other campers are Peter Potter (Terry Scott), who loathes camping but must endure his jolly yet domineering wife Harriet (Betty Marsden), with her irritating laugh, and naive first-time camper Charlie Muggins (Charles Hawtrey). Chaos ensues when a group of hippies arrive in the next field for a noisy all-night rave led by band The Flowerbuds. The campers club together and successfully drive the ravers away, but all the girls leave with them. However, there is a happy ending for Bernie and Sid when their girlfriends finally agree to move into their tent. Their joy is short-lived when Joan's mother (Amelia Bayntun) turns up, but Anthea lets loose a goat that chases Mrs Fussey away.

He was the seventh bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Potter was \\"more praised and appreciated, perhaps, than any public man in New York City's long list of great citizens\\"., 177. Lack of biographical materials Potter \\"destroyed all the material which was needed to write a satisfactory\\" biography. Both of his major biographers, George and James , had to use \\"newspaper clippings\\", augmented by remembrances of people who knew him. Sheerin also had \\"access to the complete files\\" of George F. Nelson, who had been the Potter's secretary for much of his tenure at Grace Church and for all his years as bishop., ix. Family and early life In 1818, Alonzo Potter graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, with \\"the highest honors\\". He returned to the college as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy from 1821 to 1826. During that time (1823), he married Sarah Maria Nott, who was the college president's daughter. Henry Codman was their fifth son. Henry was born on May 25, 1834 and was baptized in St. George's Church on April 14, 1835., 2, 11. In 1839, Potter's mother Sarah Nott Potter died. She was giving birth to her seventh child and only daughter. Potter was only five years old, but his father described his mother's many virtues for Henry. Among her virtues, \\"she gave herself, seemingly without a pang, to her household, to her friends, and to anyone whom she could make more happy\\". She was \\"a centre of delight to all who knew her\\"., 13., 7. According to his mother's request, Henry and the other children were placed under the care of his mother's cousin Sarah Benedict. Henry's father married Miss Benedict in 1840. They had three boys. Thus, altogether, Alonzo Potter had ten children: seven (six boys and one daughter) by Sarah Nott and three boys by Sara Benedict., 13-14. and Henry Codman Potter's siblings were as follows:Frank Hunter Potter, The Alonzo Potter Family (Concord, N.H.: Rumford Press, 1923), 64. =By Sarah Nott Potter= * Clarkson Nott Potter (1825‚Äì1882) was a Democratic member of the House of Representatives after the Civil War. * Howard Potter (1826‚Äì1897) was a New York City banker who was known for his contributions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Natural History, the Children's Aid Society, and the New York Orthopaedic Hospital. * Robert Brown Potter (1829‚Äì1887) was a United States General in the American Civil War and a financier., 211. * Edward Tuckerman Potter (1831‚Äì1904) was an architect who designed the Nott Memorial at Union College. * Eliphalet Nott Potter (1836-1901) was rector of an Episcopal Church, college professor, and president of three colleges. * Maria Louisa Potter (1839-1916) married sculptor Launt Thompson and lived in Italy.‚ÄúMaria Louisa Potter.‚Äù =By Sarah Benedict= * James Neilson Potter (1841‚Äì1906).‚ÄúClarkson Nott Potter, 1825 - 1882.‚Äù * William Appleton Potter (1842‚Äì1909) was an American architect who designed numerous buildings, including the Church of the Presidents (New Jersey) in Elberon, New Jersey. * Frank Hunter Potter, (1851‚Äì1932) served as a first lieutenant in the American Civil War. ‚ÄúFrancis M. Potter,‚Äù pages 1-4. Education The first eleven years of Henry Codman's life were spent in Schenectady. In the Union College town and in his home, \\"the pursuit of knowledge\\" was pervasive. In 1845, when Alonzo Potter was consecrated as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, the Potters moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After the move, Henry (at age eleven) was having difficulty with Latin and began \\"a habit of swearing\\". Henry spent two months with the Rev. Robert Traill Spence Lowell to be tutored in Latin and to be cured of his swearing. Mr. Lowell successfully accomplished both goals., 14-15. In the spring of 1846, Bishop Alonzo Potter had the Academy of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the City of Philadelphia reopened. Henry completed his secondary education at the academy. While attending the Academy, Henry showed no evidence of a call to the ministry. He did not take the classes in Greek and Hebrew offered to \\"candidates for the ministry\\"., 21. In 1854, the nineteen-year-old Potter was working in a \\"wholesale dry-goods house\\". In August 1854, he was \\"converted\\"., 22. Little is reported about the conversion experience, but two factors contributed to it. One was a sermon preached by M. A. de Wolf Howe, rector of St. Luke's Church, Philadelphia. The other was the influence of Clara Boyd Jacobs who owned an iron mine and forge in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania. When the Alonzo Potter family visited Spring Grove, Henry came under her influence. He later said that she turned \\"his mind in the direction of religion\\"., 9-10. Potter did not take a \\"full college course in preparation\\" for seminary. However, he became Self-taught by \\"extensive reading\\" throughout his life. As busy as he was, \\"he found time . . . to read\\". In his lectures, writings, sermons, and addresses, Potter demonstrated his wide reading. The lectures he delivered at Kenyon College in 1901 and at Yale University in 1902 showed that Potter had read John Stuart Mackenzie, Introduction to Social Philosophy, George Howell, Trade-Unionism, New and Old, Edward Bibbens & Eleanor Marx Aveling, Working Class Movement in America, Geoffrey Drage's Labor Problem, Shailer Mathews' Social Teaching of Jesus, William Hurrell Mallock, Labor and the Popular Welfare, the three volumes Sir Frederick Morton Eden, State of the Poor, the works of Frederick Denison Maurice, Charles Kingsley, and Thomas Hughes, and \\"other like books\\"., 19., 343-344. Theological Seminary in Virginia In 1854, Potter entered the Theological Seminary in Virginia located in Alexandria, Virginia. He graduated in 1857., 21. Potter's father told him he needed to receive his theological education at this seminary., 584. Potter indicated that he was pleased with his father's choice because he was a loyal alumnus who supported the seminary with words and gifts. In 1873, while he was rector of Grace Church in New York City, he served on a committee to raise money for the seminary, On October 23, 1883, at the Episcopal Church's General Convention, Virginia Seminary alumni met. Potter \\"recalled pleasant incidents of his Seminary life\\". He also gave money for enlarging the seminary chapel and for a Bible, Prayer Books, and Hymnals for use in the chancel., 68, 71, 82. The Theological Seminary in Virginia was \\"pervaded by the warmth of religion, where men of a kindly and sympathetic spirit, conscientious, studious, and saintly persons, were teaching a reasonable theology\\". Students were encouraged \\"to make up their own minds\\". In this atmosphere, Potter was \\"directed and encouraged, and his life deepened and enriched\\"., 29-30. In the summer of 1856, between his middle and senior years in the seminary, Potter was a lay-reader in a parish in Mont Alto, Pennsylvania. As the lay reader, Potter was in charge of the Sunday School. He began a church choir, and gave lectures in the nearby farmhouses. He prepared his own sermons. Writing to the parish a decade later Potter said, \\"Few places can have more attraction for me than Mont Alto. I look back when I remember my summer with you to some of the brightest memories of my life\\"., 31. After graduating in 1857, Potter was ordained deacon on May 27, 1857 in St. Luke's Church, Philadelphia. After that, his father assigned him to the parish in Greensburg, Pennsylvania., 33. Marriages and children Potter was twice married: to Eliza Rogers Jacob in 1857 and to Mrs. Alfred Clark in 1902. =Eliza Rogers Jacob= On October 8, 1857, Potter married, as his first wife, Eliza Rogers Jacob. She died on June 29, 1901. They had six children: * Alonzo Potter was in the \\"banking and brokerage\\" business and the father of movie director H. C.

Potter's biographers tell little about Eliza Jacob and say nothing about how Potter felt about her. There is little information about their children in the biographies. However, from a letter written by their daughter Jane Potter Russell, \\"it was clear that the Potters‚Äô family life was good\\". The father \\"cared deeply for his children,\\" his children \\"cared for and respected him, and \\"all the recollections are happy\\"., 11. On June 29, 1901, Eliza Rogers Jacob Potter died suddenly at home. She was survived by a son and five daughters. The funeral was at Grace Church in New York City., 339-340. =Mrs. Alfred Corning Clark= On October 4, 1902, fifteen months after the death of his first wife, Potter married his second wife, Mrs. Alfred Corning Clark (n√©e Elizabeth Scriven) (1848-1909). Mrs. Clark, of Manhattan and Cooperstown, New York, had been a widow for six years. She belonged to the Episcopal Church, concurred with Potter's \\"religious and social desires,\\" and had helped him in his work as bishop. Both families were \\"cordially in favor of the wedding\\".Nicholas Fox Weber, The Clarks of Cooperstown (Alfred A. Knopf, 2009), 104-105. By this marriage, Potter gained four stepsons: Edward Severin Clark, Robert Sterling Clark, F. Ambrose Clark, and Stephen Carlton Clark. The second Mrs. Potter died on March 4, 1909 \\"after a short illness,\\" less than eight months after Potter's own death. Ministry as priest As a priest, Potter served in four parishes before becoming a bishop. =Christ Church, 1857-58= When Potter went to Greensburg, Pennsylvania in 1857, its population was \\"about thirteen hundred inhabitants\\". For intellectual friendship, Potter had only \\"a Roman Catholic lawyer who was a drunkard\\" and \\"an infidel physician who was a rake\\"., 36. While in Greensburg, on October 15, 1857, Potter was ordained a priest by Bp Samuel Bowman of Diocese of Pittsburgh. To fulfill his \\"missionary obligations,\\" Potter conducted \\"occasional services in adjoining towns\\". He bought a horse which he \\"fed and groomed\\"., 37, 40. In 1857, Potter refused a call to Calvary Church in a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, in May 1859 he accepted a call to St. John's Church, Troy, N.Y., 40-41. =St. John's Church, Troy, N.Y., 1859-66= Potter was the rector of St. John's Church, Troy, N.Y. from 1859 to 1866. In the years preceding Potter's tenure, there had been \\"frequent changes\\" in rectors partly caused by \\"parochial disagreement\\". After seven years as rector, when Potter resigned, the vestry wrote him, \\"Before you came among us, we well remember the dissentient views that obtained not only in our own body but in the congregation which we represent\\". This did not happen during Potter's incumbency., 44. Both Potter and his wife were active in the church and in Troy organizations. After five years, the parish had grown from seventy families to a hundred and sixty. The number of communicant had increased from a hundred and fifty to three hundred and five. The church had to be remodeled to provide room for the congregation. In 1881, a later rector of St. John's said that the growth of the parish during Potter's tenure was partly due to his \\"remarkable personal influence\\" and partly to way he presented \\"the church's teaching\\" especially to people who were not members., 50-51. Potter's success at St. John's made him widely known. In 1862, he was called to Christ Church in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in 1863, he was called to St. Paul's Church in Albany, New York. In 1863, he was offered the presidency of Kenyon College. He declined them all., 57. In April 1866, Potter accepted a call from Trinity Church, Boston, as Assistant Minister on the Greene Foundation. The vestry of St. John's wrote him an appreciative farewell. There were \\"a hundred young men\\" at the station to bid Potter farewell when he left Troy. =Trinity Church, 1866-1868= Potter was Assistant Minister on the Greene Foundation, at Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts from 1866 to 1868. In 1866, he was made the secretary of the Episcopal Church's House of bishops and retained this position until 1883 when he was. In 1868, Potter accepted a call to be the rector of Grace Church, New York City. The vestry of Trinity Church gave Potter a letter thanking him for \\"the uninterrupted prosperity spiritual and secular\\" he had brought to the parish., 66. =Grace Church, 1868-1883= When Potter became rector of Grace Church (New York City), the previous rector had just died and before that he was partially disabled by a carriage accident in 1865. Therefore, he was unable to provide leadership, and \\"the church drifted\\". The focus of its activities was its members. There were Sunday worship and a Sunday School. The women had a Sewing Society. The minister visited his parishioners. In contrast, Potter possessed \\"immense practical perceptions\\". Potter brought a different understanding of parish life. He believed that \\"religion should minister to the whole man\\". He introduced new things such as \\"Christmas trees, and choirs of men and boys, and daily services and weekly communions, and flowers at Easter, and church schools and church infirmaries, and parish houses\\". Under Potter's leadership Grace Church reached \\"out to an environing community\\".‚ÄúHistory of Grace Church, NYC.‚Äù and , 69-70. Under Potter's leadership Grace Church became known as \\"New York's most picturesque and useful parish\\". George F. Nelson, who was Potter's assistant at Grace Church, attributes the progress to the fact that \\"the Rector and his Vestry were brethren dwelling together in unity. A discordant note among them was unthinkable\\"., 26. Problem of the poor The Panic of 1873 brought \\"hard times\\" for the people. This condition made Potter's work more difficult. It also made him face \\"the problem of the poor\\" and \\"to study it more carefully.\\" In 1874, Potter used what he had learned in his study about poverty in his Sixth Annual Account of the Parish Work Potter when he addressed the question of how best to aid and relieve the poor. In summary, he said the following:, 86-89. :# \\"It should be remembered, in the first place, that no rule for helping poor people, any more than any other people, can be a sweeping one of universal application.\\" :# There are \\"professional paupers.\\" They are \\"not entitled to the indiscriminate benefactions\\" which increase the number of such paupers. The \\"truer and more Christian charity\\" would be to help them find work. :# There are those who held \\"the clearest claim upon our sympathy and help.\\" These are \\"the sick, the crippled, the blind or imbecile, or otherwise incapacitated; poor women and untaught childhood; children and young girls left orphaned or alone in this great city; persons of gentle nurture and antecedents who have met with reverses; all these at our doors, and then the family of the stranger and the missionary beyond them, alike have a claim.\\" Meeting their needs should have priority :# Finally, Potter said in his Sixth Annual Account of the Parish Work that \\"the cynicism and indifference which sneers at all charity alike\\" is worse than \\"the sentimentalism of indiscriminate and thoughtless charity.\\" On December 19, 1874, Potter was elected as bishop of the Diocese of Iowa on the second ballot. However, he declined the election because, as he said, \\"his commitment to Grace Church had priority.\\", 92. Ministry to the poor In October 1875, Potter called Sister Louise, a member of the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion, as Parish Visitor at Grace Chapel, and she accepted. One of the things she did was organize St. Catharine's Guild. The Guild had seventeen members. They were all working women who had families to care for. The Guild members visited and cared for \\"the sick poor\\" by sewing for and reading to them. They also helped disabled persons get to worship. They brought children to be baptized and adults to Sister Louise's Bible class, which had more than 150 members.M. Van Rensselaer, Sister Louise: the Story of Her Life Work (E. & J. B. Young & Co., 1883). Potter's desire to minister to the poor was actualized by building the Grace Memorial House as a nursery and rebuilding Grace Chapel in 1876 for use as a community center offering classes teaching English and other things to immigrants. In Potter's vision, the \\"ideal parish\\" was permeated by both a \\"sense of privilege\\" and a \\"sense of responsibility.\\" Church people \\"should be intent not on the advancement\\" of the Christian Church, but on \\"the health, the character, and the happiness of all the citizens.\\" This meant that serving God was not for just religious professionals, but \\"all are summoned to serve Him in the normal occupations of the common life.\\" While insisting on serving God through \\"social service\\" by the parish and its members, Potter stressed \\"the essential necessity of the life of the Spirit.\\" In the layout of church buildings the social service buildings, Grace Hall and Grace House, were beside Grace Chapel. This layout bore witness \\"to the fact that they who would serve the community well must first seek strength from on high.\\", 79, 103, 112. Accomplishments By the end of Potter's tenure at Grace Church, four new buildings had been built. In Grace Chapel, there were services in German. Pastoral visits were being made. The children were being instructed. There were sixteen organizations which addressed \\"a wide range of spiritual and physical needs.\\" These included St. Catherine's Guild, Industrial School, St. Luke's Association, Ladies‚Äô Benevolent Society, Woman's Missionary Society, Grace House Library and Reading Room, Day Nursery, Grace House by the Sea in Far Rockaway, Long Island, St. Agnes Guild, and Ladies‚Äô Domestic Missionary Relief Association., 106., 13, 90. and Mrs. A. T. Twing, editor, Church Work, Volume 3 (M. H. Mallory, 1888 ), 30. Henry C. Potter's uncle Horatio Potter had been bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York since 1854. On September 12, 1883, he asked for an assistant. On September 27, 1883, during the regular Diocesan Convention, an election was held. Potter was elected on the third ballot. He accepted the next day. He was consecrated at Grace Church on October 20, 1883., 123-124, 126. The new bishop remained as rector of Grace Church until the end of 1883. In his last sermon, he said, \\"looking back today, after fifteen years and more, I rejoice to remember that this parish has at least striven to be plenteous in peace, affluent in faith, worship and good works. May God keep it so, and more and more make it so, through all the years to come.\\", 121. After Potter died, a marble bust of him was placed in the North Transept of Grace Church. Ministry as bishop On September 27, 1883, Potter was elected assistant bishop to his uncle, Horatio Potter, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and was consecrated on October 20, 1883. The full account of Potter's election as assistant bishop and his consecration can be read online at The Election and Consecration of the Rev. Henry Codman Potter, D.D., LL D.: As Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of New York (Episcopal Church. Diocese of New York, J. Pott, 1883.) Henry Potter was assistant bishop until Bishop Horatio Potter died on January 2, 1887. At that time, he became officially the Bishop of New York as he had been in fact., 197. On the night of his consecration, Potter visited the Midnight Mission run by the Sisters of St. John the Baptist. On the next day, he preached to prisoners in the penitentiary on Blackwell's Island., 46. =Advent Mission= By 1883, Potter realized the Episcopal Church needed some way for \\"reaching sinners.\\" Therefore, he decided to \\"import a successful English Missioner\\" for \\"a general revival in the Episcopal parishes of New York.\\" During the Advent season of 1885, \\"the mission was held simultaneously in twenty-one parishes.\\", 183-184, 187. The Churchman for December 26, 1885 carried an article, which it had requested, by Potter about the mission. Potter began the article by differentiating the Advent Mission from Revivalism with its \\"emotional excitement.\\" The Mission was carrying out \\"the idea of Advent season,\\" namely, \\"preaching, personal urgency, confession of sin, communion with God in the blessed sacrament of His son.\\" Then, while recognizing that \\"the results of the Mission are not easily ascertained,\\" he outlined some of the things the mission accomplished. # Preparation for the Mission, by a group of clergymen, began a year before it took place. Their meetings began with \\"a celebration of the Holy Communion\\" followed by \\"an informal devotional meeting.\\" # The Mission was \\"its absence of excitement.\\" But there was \\"clear and faithful teaching\\" and a \\"determined endeavor to press home the truth upon the personal conscience.\\" # The Mission included an \\"informal and personal approach to individuals\\" in the \\"personal counsels and interviews\\" conducted after the meetings. Potter said that there were many testimonies to the benefit of this personal approach. # The Mission reached the \\"lapsed baptized and confirmed\\" members. Many such people were \\"awakened and recalled.\\" # The Mission showed \\"the value of informal methods\\" in reaching the lapsed. \\"Greater freedom\\" in prayers and hymns \\"brought home\\" what the formal Prayer Book services had not. # The Mission demonstrated two things: (1) \\"the power of the Church to reach men\\" and (2) \\"the value of trained missioners as preachers.\\" # The Mission \\"deepened the faith\\" of the people carried it out. =Race relations= Race relations concerned Potter \\"for many years.\\" It was not the \\"central issue\\" for him, but it was important enough to him that he \\"devoted considerable time and energy to it.\\", 262. He served on the board of the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen. However, as with many of his contemporaries, Potter's \\"concern was moderate.\\", 64. Virginia Theological Seminary: 1854-1857 Potter was first involved in race relations between blacks and whites while a student at the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandra, Virginia. The student body was composed of students from the north and south \\"in about equal numbers.\\" The question of slavery was discussed in seminary meetings with passionate disagreement., 32-33. The father of the student Potter was Bishop Alonzo Potter who was anti-slavery, so it likely that his son was also., 65. American Colonization Society: 1868-1899 In 1817, the American Colonization Society (ACS) was founded. Before the American Civil War, it had sent more than twelve thousand black settlers to Liberia. Two Episcopal clergymen Bishop William Meade and the Rev. William Augustus Muhlenberg supported the Society. Because of their influence, Potter became interested in the Society. In 1868, he was elected as \\"a life director.\\", 66, 43-44. In 1886, when Potter was elected as vice-president, he warned the Society that would not do much, and attended no meetings until January 1892 when he was elected as president because he had \\"the respect of blacks and whites.\\" At the time of his election, Potter was in England addressing the British Christian Union about the contrast between the homogeneity of an English diocese and the \\"racial patchwork\\" of his diocese. Potter accepted the office on condition that the Society would adopt \\"new purposes and procedures.\\", 44., 22. In October 1892, Potter spelled out the changes he wanted. Rather than \\"getting rid of America's racial problem,\\" the Society's goal should be based on \\"a positive interest in Africa's future.\\" The Society should recruit \\"a few industrious, well-educated black people\\" to move to Liberia \\"renovate the Liberian social order\\" so that Liberia could \\"depend less on others.\\" However, the Society was unable to recruit such people. Therefore, Potter set two other goals for the Society: (1) it would work for \\"the rejuvenation of the Afro-American character\\" in the United States, and (2) it would send \\"black missionaries\\" to Africa to teach and to convert to Christianity., 23, 44, 46. For \\"the rejuvenation of the Afro-American character\\" in the United States, Potter supported \\"education and equal opportunity for the freedmen.\\" He said that \\"race prejudice dies slowly and hard,\\" but, optimistically, Potter said that he thought it was \\"steadily diminishing.\\" However, in the 1890s, there was a \\"counter attack aimed at erasing African Americans' participation in politics and the economy\\" by disenfranchisement in every southern state, by Jim Crow laws segregating public facilities, and by lynching. These events made Potter less optimistic about the \\"decline of race prejudice.\\" He said that \\"prejudice\\" and \\"race antagonism\\" should be \\"outgrown,\\" but, \\"as a matter of fact,\\" they are not., 44-46. Potter's attempt to reform the Society was met with criticism from people like Wendell Phillips Garrison editor of The Nation, and his fund- raising efforts failed. On February 7, 1894, Potter spoke at the Old South Meeting House in Boston, but he aroused \\"more opposition than support.\\" After Potter's speech, several \\"black leaders\\" stood to \\"denounce the society and Liberia.\\" Later, a group of \\"black leaders\\" met at the Charles Street A. M. E. Church in Boston and \\"passed resolutions denouncing Potter's address.\\", 47. Potter received verbal support from another Episcopal bishop Thomas Underwood Dudley and from Jeremiah Rankin the president of Howard University, but that did not help Potter's fund-raising effort. He made a final fund-raising effort in New York City in small meetings organized by two of his priests Percy Stickney Grant and David H. Greer, but again without success. In addition to opposition to the cause for which Potter was working, his efforts were hampered by the Panic of 1893. This financial panic created a depression that reduced the income of all \\"benevolent agencies\\" in a \\"staggering\\" way. Potter said, \\"The present unexampled straitness has crippled philanthropic enterprises beyond anything I have ever known.\\", 115-116. In 1894, a symposium was held on the subject of lynching during which Joseph Cook, a Boston preacher and editor of Our Day: A Record and Review of Current Reform, criticized Potter for his failure to speak out in opposition to lynching. , 105. In 1899, Potter resigned as president of the Society, ending his participation. In 1911, the American Colonization Society died., 56. Race relations in Potter's religious beliefs In 1865, the Episcopal Church's General Convention adopted a thanksgiving \\"for peace in the country and union in the Church.\\" However, the thanksgiving did not include a \\"thanksgiving for the restoration of union in the nation, and for the removal of the curse of slavery.\\" Potter expressed indignation at the convention's action. In his sermons, he \\"maintained that the victory over slavery was a victory for divine justice.\\", 63-64. In 1870, the General Convention established the permanent Commission on Home Missions to Colored People. Potter attended the meetings and preached \\"in support of its work.\\" One of Potter's early acts as bishop was to take \\"a prominent part\\" in the Consecration of the Negro Samuel David Ferguson as Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Liberia. In 1907, the year before he died, Potter \\"incurred odium\\" during the General Convention held in Richmond, Virginia \\"by asking a colored clergyman to be a guest at his table.\\" \\"Human brotherhood under a divine father\\" was a constant theme for Potter. After the Reconstruction Era ended in 1877, he preached against the \\"spirit of caste\\" and warned of the resulting \\"bitter and bloody fruit.\\" He said that the Church exists to \\"resist and rebuke this hateful spirit.\\" No matter what distinctions exist in society, \\"inside the household of the common Father . . . they are to be obliterated and forgotten.\\" However, along with his belief that blacks were \\"equal to whites as children of a common divine father,\\" Potter held that blacks \\"needed further preparation before assuming the full rights and responsibilities of American political and economic life.\\", 78-79, 81-82. Racial reform In the post Civil War period, white racial reformers, both religious and secular, made use of three basic strategies: \\"first, advocacy of civil rights for blacks; second, education for blacks in the southern states through domestic missions and philanthropic agencies; and third, support for the colonization or resettlement of blacks in Africa, especially in Liberia.\\" As president of the American Colonization Society, Potter was \\"prominently involved in the colonization movement.\\" He also \\"provided some support for religious and philanthropic educational work by and for blacks.\\" However, he did not work for the civil rights of blacks. During his four decades in New York City, Potter \\"addressed many public issues,\\" but there is no evidence of his speaking out on civil rights issues. Potter mentioned the lynchings of blacks only once. It was not in public discourse, but in 1898 in his \\"argument against U.S. administration of the Philippines.\\", 64-65. Booker T. Washington In June 1875, Booker T. Washington graduated from the Hampton Institute in Virginia, and Potter attended the ceremony. As Washington recalled the occasion, after giving his \\"graduating address,\\" Potter took his hand and said, \\"If you ever come to New York and want a friend, come in and see me.\\", 190. Potter also indicated that the occasion marked the beginning of a friendship with Washington. He told The New York Times in 1910 that \\"Mr. Washington has been on a number of occasions a guest at my table.\\" Potter added his belief about relations between white and blacks: \\"It is the man, not the color or the nationality, that counts. I can see no reason why a negro, if he be a man of intellect and culture, should not be received in the home of any man.\\" Not only were Potter and Washington friends, Potter supported Washington's educational efforts for blacks., 69-70. Washington also held Potter in high regard. After Potter died, a memorial service for him was held by the People's Institute. Washington was one of the speakers. He praised Potter for giving him \\"safe and sound\\" advice concerning black people and Tuskegee Institute and he praised Potter for \\"his consuming desire to serve his fellow man.\\" He said that Potter was \\"always guided\\" by one question: \\"Is it the right thing to do?\\", 190-191. Washington recalled the last time he saw Potter in a public meeting. It was on a Sunday afternoon in a \\"little crowded negro church,\\" which was not an Episcopal Church. He said that \\"after a busy Sunday morning,\\" Potter arrived and \\"for an hour he poured out his great soul before that audience of colored men and women.\\" Washington closed his talk by quoting from the Robert Burns poem \\"A Man's A Man For A' That,\\" in which Burns says that a \\"man's character\\" should be \\"the measure of a man's true worth,\\" not \\"wealth, or lack of it, and social class.\\" =Labor and social service= On May 10, 1886, Potter issued a pastoral letter to his clergy regarding labor. The Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor (CAIL) later used the document as its inspiration, especially its statement that \\"what the laborer wants from his employer is fair and fraternal dealing, not alms-giving; and a recognition of his manhood rather than a condescension to his inferiority.\\" In 1892, Potter was made the association's honorary vice-president. In 1893, he was made the chairman of its Committee of Mediation and Arbitration. When the National Civic Federation was established in 1900, Potter was from the start a member of the executive committee. As such, he was involved with the steel strike of 1901 and the anthracite Coal strike of 1902. He worked for the public interest to be considered in disputes between capital and labor. In one case, President George Frederick Baer of the anthracite railways argued, \\"cannot I do what I will with my own?\\" Potter replied, \\"Ah, well, but what is my own?\\", 122-123. In August 1901, a strike by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers against the United States Steel Corporation \\"threatened to be a national disaster.\\" Potter wrote a letter to William Randolph Hearst suggesting \\"a symposium of clever men discussing the question of wages, common ownership of plants and land‚Äîanything to make the people think.\\", 340. The symposium was held and reported in the book John Punnett Peters, Labor and Capital: A Discussion of the Relations of Employer and Employed. (1902). In December 1902, Potter spoke to the Men's Club of Grace Chapel about what he learned from the 1901 strike. He said, \\"I believe in strikes. I believe also in the conservative value of the organization from which the strikes come. . . . This Republic stands for personal freedom; anything that impairs that freedom, the country will not stand for.\\" Looking toward the future, Potter said that he believed that \\"the time was approaching when strikes will cease, because men will ask themselves in the presence of their differences, not what considerations of profit and dividends, but what considerations of justice and humanity are involved.\\", 347. In 1907, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church, \\"as a result largely of Bishop Potter's influence,\\" action was taken to form diocesan Social Service Commissions. He chaired the one for his diocese and was active in it until his death., 194. In his writing, speaking, and acting Potter demonstrated that he was \\"frankly the champion of the working-man.\\" He was chosen by labor unions \\"to arbitrate their disputes with their employers\\" because they were sure that he would be both fair and sympathetic. He served on the Committee on Conciliation and Mediation of the Civic Federation This position fit Potter's character which was without \\"partisan instincts.\\" He worked for \\"truth and right\\" without regard for \\"names and labels.\\" He was not \\"either socialist or capitalist.\\" He \\"spoke with equal frankness\\" to corporate executives, many of whom he knew personally, and \\"to the labor unions,\\" telling them \\"exactly what he thought.\\", 345-346. =Cathedral= By 1887, \\"the erection of a cathedral\\" seemed to Potter \\"not only important but necessary,\\" so he issued \\"a public appeal to the citizens of New York\\" for funds to build a cathedral, which would become the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. In the appeal, Potter listed five ways that a cathedral would meet \\"practical and urgent demands.\\", 198-102. :# \\"It would be the people's church.\\" :# \\"It would be the rightful centre of practical philanthropies.\\" :# \\"It would have a pulpit in which the best preachers . . . from all parts of the land . . . would have a place.\\" :# \\"It would be the fitting shrine of memorials of our honored dead.\\" :# \\"It would tell to all men everywhere that 'the life is more than meat and the body than raiment.\\" Potter said that \\"our democratic age demands a place of worship that will not disregard the teachings of the Founder of Christianity. In this Cathedral there will be no pews, no locked doors, no pre-payment for sittings, no reserved rights of caste or rank, but one and the same welcome for all.\\" There was opposition to building a cathedral, but \\"for the most part,\\" people who spoke out \\"were in favor of the plan.\\", 205. Originally, a board of trustees was convened to purchase property \\"below Central Park\\", and several donors were secured. However, there were insufficient funds to purchase the land after the donors lost money in the Panic of 1873. When Henry Potter became assistant bishop, he convened the Trustees to address the property issue. In 1887, a site was chosen on Morningside Heights about four miles north of the original choice. This placed the Cathedral \\"on the highest ground in Manhattan,\\" 151 feet (46 meters) higher than Central Park., 206. At this time, more foreign tongues were spoken in New York than English.\\" In making plans for the cathedral, Potter recognized that New York was a polyglot metropolis. Thus, plans for the cathedral included \\"seven Chapels of Tongues\\" about the Sanctuary for services in different languages., 262. In 1888, Potter was away from his diocese in England attending the Lambeth Conference. While in England, he gave \\"an address at Lambeth Palace commemorating the centennial of the organization of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States,\\" and he preached in three cathedrals., 221-222., 15. On December 27, 1892, the Feast of St. John the Evangelist, Potter laid the cathedral's cornerstone, and in the winter of 1896‚Äì1897, Potter worked full-time raising money for cathedral., 274, 290. In 1901, Potter founded the Choir School of The Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\\" =Centennial sermon, 1889= On April 30, 1889, Potter gave a sermon on the centennial of George Washington's inauguration in Trinity Church's St. Paul's Chapel. The President Benjamin Harrison and Vice-President Levi P. Morton of the United States were in attendance. Two former presidents were present along with \\"an assembly of officers of the Cabinet, senators, members of Congress, and notable citizens, including a score of governors of states.\\" It was generally thought that Potter was the only speaker who rose to the occasion. The New York Times wrote that \\"the most remarkable address brought out by the centennial celebration was the sermon by Bishop Potter at St. Paul's Chapel.\\", 224-225. The full sermon can be read at A Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving to Almighty God delivered on Tuesday, April 30, 1889, the one hundredth anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington. Potter's sermon gave him \\"a national reputation.\\" He became \\"recognized throughout the country as a man of wisdom to understand the times, and of courage to express the convictions based on that understanding.\\", 239. Potter possessed a combination of \\"oratorical skill, episcopal status and social acceptability.\\" These characteristics made him one of the Protestant preachers, along with Henry Ward Beecher and Lyman Abbott, most often called upon for \\"major public functions.\\", 16. =Personal life= By 1898, Potter had been bishop of New York fourteen years. People turned to Potter \\"not as the bishop, but the man,\\" whose \\"words were heard with attention\\" and whose \\"acts were of interest to the public.\\" He became known as \\"the first citizen of New York.\\", 287. Two noted Americans wrote Potter expressing their admiration for him. One was Henry Martyn Field, owner and editor of the Evangelist, who wrote this letter:, 295. > My dear Bishop Potter, you are the best man in the world. You always say the > right word and do the right thing, but how you find the time to do it all is > a mystery. Your influence goes far beyond your own Episcopal Church, large > and powerful as that is, and you are equally at home among the rich and > poor. I have been looking to you to solve some of the social problems that > perplex us all. For my part, I am groping in the dark, but God give us > light. May you live far into the next century, and help greatly to make the > world purer, sweeter and happier than it now is. The other letter came from the American author Henry van Dyke, who wrote, \\"I want to say to you, beneficent prelate, that there is not a preacher nor a church of any order in New York that does not reap a substantial benefit from the fact that you are the bishop of this diocese, and therefore we are all, in our several modes and manners, gratefully yours.\\", 296. =Assessing the Philippines and Hawaiian Islands= In May 1898, after the United States defeated the Spanish fleet in the Philippines, the United States had two colonies in the Pacific: the Philippines by conquest, the Hawaiian Islands by annexation. By action of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church of 1898, Potter and the Rev. Percy Stickney Grant were appointed to visit these two colonies and assess their missionary potential. In spite of the fact that Potter had thought that the United States action was morally \\"a colossal blunder,\\" after his return to New York, he said, \\"We have got the responsibility of governing the Philippines, for better or for worse. . . . It is too late to get rid of them.\\", 313-314, 323-324. Based on the Potter-Grant report, the 1901 General Convention made the Philippine Islands and the Hawaiian Islands Missionary Districts and elected bishops for them: Charles Brent for the Philippine Islands and Henry Bond Restarick for the Hawaiian Islands., 325. =Mayor Van Wyck= In May 1899, Potter called the Rev. Robert L. Paddock to be vicar of the new pro-cathedral. When Paddock reported vice in the area to the police, they insulted Paddock. He found that the police in the area were \\"in the pay of criminals.\\" The September 1900 Diocesan Convention requested Potter to take action. He did so by writing Mayor Robert Anderson Van Wyck who, in turn passed the letter on to the President of the Police Board who, in turn wrote Potter that the matter would be investigated, but with no apparent action. In 1901, Potter again brought the unresolved matter to the Diocesan Convention and called for action by citizens. The citizens of New York City responded by organizing Citizens United and defeating the Tammany Hall candidates in the next election in which Seth Low was elected as mayor., 271, 327, 330, 337-338. Seth Low gave Potter \\"credit for an increased public desire for reform in civil service appointments\\" by his 1889 Centennial Sermon in St. Paul's Chapel.\\", 57. =Subway Tavern= Potter was concerned about how the \\"evils of alcohol\\" affected the poor and new immigrants. The abstinence approach was inadequate because there would always be some people who drank alcohol. So Potter decided to establish a tavern in which the staff would \\"monitor and guide patrons to more responsible imbibing.\\" Because the location was near an entrance to the New York City Subway, it was called the Subway Tavern. The tavern opened on August 2, 1904. It was funded with $10,000 given by citizens including New York City alderman Herbert Parsons and former lacrosse star Elgin Gould. Potter wanted a tavern for working people which would be \\"jovial and free-spirited without becoming debaucherous.\\" In September 1905, The Advance, a weekly religious magazine, ran an article called \\"Bishop Potter's Subway Tavern\\" by a clergyman who had investigated the tavern. After giving the Subway Tavern credit for some improvements over other taverns, the clergyman deemed it morally lacking on four counts as follows: :# Liquor sold at the tavern does not make drinkers sober. :# A person can go to another tavern for more drinks. :# A person can acquire the drink habit in the Subway Tavern and then drink elsewhere \\"to complete his ruin.\\" :# Even the limited drinking in the Subway Tavern might ruin a person. In conclusion, the clergyman wrote, \\"So far as I could learn or observe in three visits at different hours and on two different days, the place has all the dangers which those who opposed it anticipated.\\" Shortly after The Advance article was published, the Subway Tavern as Potter had envisioned it closed. A commercial saloon opened in the building. =Pan-Anglican Congress, 1908= In 1908, Potter attended the Pan-Anglican Congress in London. There were more than two hundred bishops and \\"several thousand clergy and laity.\\" Group meetings were held simultaneously in halls throughout the city. Delegates looked for Potter because they viewed him \\"as not only the greatest representative of American churchmen but as one of whom any English speaking Christian might be proud.\\" To them, Potter combined \\"human graciousness\\" with \\"official dignity.\\" While in England, Potter \\"preached often in the greatest of English pulpits,\\" such as Canterbury Cathedral, the Chapel Royal, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. The Pall Mall Gazette wrote about his preaching that \\"even the smallest child in the gallery could understand every word.\\", 172-174. Lectures In June 1890, Potter gave the Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard University. His topic was \\"The Scholar and the State.\\", 244. In 1901, Potter delivered the Bedell lectures at Kenyon College on the subject \\"Man, Men, and their Master.\\"\\" These lectures showed Potter \\"at his intellectual best.\\" From April 21 to May 2, 1902, Potter delivered the William E. Dodge lectures at Yale University., 343. The lectures can be read at The Citizen in His Relation to the Industrial Situation: Yale Lectures. In October 1905, Potter lectured at the University of St Andrews in Scotland., 375. Honorary degrees and Positions =Honorary degrees= * Union College awarded the honorary degrees of Master of Arts in 1863, of Doctor of Divinity in 1865, and of Doctor of Laws in 1877., 24., 134. * Trinity College awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1877. * Cambridge University awarded a Doctor of Laws in 1888., 173. * Harvard University awarded the Doctor of Divinity in 1890. * The University of Oxford awarded a Doctor of Civil Law in 1892. * Bishop's University awarded a Doctor of Canon Law in 1894. * The University of Pennsylvania awarded a Doctor of Laws in 1901., 342. * Yale University awarded a Doctor of Laws in 1901. * The University of St Andrews in Scotland awarded the Doctor of Laws degree in 1905. =Positions= * In 1892, the Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor (CAIL) made Potter the association's honorary vice-president. * Potter was the first president of the Pilgrims of the United States. He held the office from 1903 to 1907. Declining health and death On May 7, 1902, during a service in which Potter was to speak, he felt faint. He spoke, but he cleared his schedule for a rest. This was the first indication that after twenty years of demanding work as a bishop, \\"Bishop Potter had broken down.\\" His feeling faint marked \\"the beginning of the end\\" for him., 352. In September 1902, Potter told the Diocesan Convention that he needed assistance \\"in the Episcopal oversight of the Diocese.\\" As a solution, the Convention voted for the election of a Bishop Coadjutor. On October 1, 1903, David H. Greer was elected on the first ballot. Greer was consecrated on January 26, 1904. In dividing the work, Potter gave Greer the visitation of most city parishes. Potter did the visitations to the \\"country parishes\\" and \\"the smaller churches of the city.\\", 170-171., 356-358. In 1905, Potter made his last trip abroad. He lectured at the University of St Andrews. He preached in the Province of York and in the Province of Canterbury. From London, he traveled to Paris and wintered in Egypt. In March, he was in charge of St. Paul's Church in Rome. He spent Holy Week and Easter in Dresden, Germany. After returning to New York, he continued \\"speaking and preaching\\" and presiding over meetings and public assemblies., 375-376, 378. In May 1908, Potter \\"suffered another collapse.\\" From then on, his health became the dominant factor in his life. He was forced to decline the invitation from the Archbishop of Canterbury for the 1908 Lambeth Conference because of poor health. In July 1908, he went to his wife's summer home in the village of Cooperstown, N. Y. to recuperate. However, he was terminally ill with \\"arteriosclerosis, an embolism in his right leg,\\" and chronic stomach and liver problems. So he was confined to the home. He died there on July 21, 1908., 22. Funeral and interment After Potter's death, there was a private service for friends and family in Cooperstown during which all the businesses were closed. The men of the village marched behind the coffin to the train station from which Potter would be sent to New York City for a later public service. Potter's body lay in state in Trinity Church, New York City until the public funeral at Grace Church on October 20, 1908, the twenty-fifth anniversary of Potter's consecration. Potter's body was interred in the crypt of his Cathedral: the first interment in the cathedral. It was later moved to the cathedral's Chapel of St. James, which had been funded by Mrs. Potter. Henry Codman Potter tomb in 1917 On October 31, 1908, The Outlook carried the story of Potter's funeral in Grace Church. There were \\"more than five hundred\\" clergy in the procession, including eighteen bishops. The pall bearers were leading citizens of New York. \\"The church was crowded with a great congregation representing all the best elements of municipal life.\\" The diversity of people who attended the funeral showed that Potter was \\"not only an ecclesiastic of great position and influence, but a great citizen, identified with many organizations dealing with the higher life of the city.\\" Many religious leaders attended the funeral: Jewish, Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Russian Orthodox, and the Persian, Greek, and Armenian Churches.The Outlook, Vol. 90, No. 9, October 31, 1908 (Outlook Publishing Company, 1908), 467. Memorial documents Two memorials were written in honor of Potter. One was by a committee of diocesan clergy; the other by a committee of the Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor (CAIL) =Memorial by diocesan clergy= A committee of diocesan clergy prepared a Memorial for Potter. The Memorial said that \\"he was the Citizen-Bishop. Human life appealed to him with irresistible force. Its problems and questions were of supreme concern. His interest was as far as possible from any thought of condescension or patronage. He did not force himself to show this interest. It was not the question of a duty to which he bowed himself, but rather the vital movement of his own nature. He was a man of the world in the best sense, and therefore touched the world with an ease and freedom, a sense of mastery and knowledge, a bright and eager interest in all its life, that made him above all else the citizen. He was the citizen before he became the ecclesiastic. He was the Citizen Bishop.\\" The Memorial quoted from what was said of him by Rev. Walton W. Battershall, who was in the Diocese of Albany with Potter when Potter was in Troy, N. Y.: \\"He had insight, forecast, tact, knowledge of men, genial touch of men, sympathy with his period, with American methods and ideals. He was keen to catch the human appeal from all sorts and conditions of men. He had that audacity, faith, courage, and faculty for organization, that give leadership. . . . Prayer was to him the deepest reality of his life.\\" The memorial ended by characterizing Henry Codman Potter as a \\"true prophet, true priest, true bishop.\\", 380-381. =Memorial by CAIL= At the October 1908 meeting of the executive committee of the Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor (CAIL), a subcommittee was appointed to express the sorrow of the association in the loss of Potter, who had been its president. Of Potter, the Memorial said in part, \\"with a statesman's breadth of vision, he saw that [the great industrial problems] were the most essential problems with which, at the moment, Christianity has to grapple. . . . Bishop Potter's services as chairman of our Committee on Mediation and Arbitration won for him on the one side, the affection and the confidence of the laboring men of this city, and, on the other side made him increasingly conscious of the necessity of official action on the part of the Church for the solution of the labor problems of the day.\\", 192-194. Legacy A July 1908 editorial in The New York Times about Potter included the following words:, 16. > He felt profoundly the brotherhood of the race, and he manifested courage, > force, independence of judgment, and great unselfishness in the application > of the principle to the relations of daily life. Apart from the more > specific duties of the Church, nothing engaged more intimately and > passionately all the energies of his nature than systematic work for the > practical application of the ideal of brotherhood to the aid of those to > whom it is usually extended only in pale and ineffectual theory. In 1908, a Memorial Meeting sponsored by the People's Institute was held in the Cooper Union. One of the speakers Rabbi Joseph Silverman said regarding Potter: \\"The city has been benefitted by his liberalism. Many institutions have profited through his liberality in their inception and development, and thousands upon thousands of human beings have been strengthened in mind, in heart, and in spirit by his words of beauty and of strength.\\", 133-134. Another speaker Booker T. Washington, the famous educator, summed up his speech by saying, \\"He never asked of a thing to do, Is it popular? He asked only, Is it the right thing to do?\\" A third speaker Seth Low, once president of Columbia University and mayor of New York, declared that Potter \\"so eagerly helped the lowly because he claimed kinship with them.\\", 176. George F. Nelson, who was Potter's assistant at Grace Church, New York and Bishop Potter's secretary throughout the twenty-five years of his Episcopate, said of Potter that he was a \\"preacher, house-to-house pastor, organizer and director\\" combined in one \\"alive and alert\\" person. Everything human interested him and he viewed humanity as made in \\"the image of the divinity that makes all men brothers.\\" His ideal was \\"to do justly, and love mercy and walk humbly with God\\" (Micah 6:8), and nothing could \\"shake his loyalty to his ideal.\\" Works =Books by Potter= * Sisterhoods and Deaconesses at Home and Abroad (1872). *The Gates of the East: A Winter in Egypt and Syria (1876). *Sermons of the City (1881). *Addresses to Women Engaged in Church Work (1887). * Waymarks (1892). * Brilliaints: Selected from the Writings of Henry C.

He was also known in the 1960s for his extensive collaborations with producer Alan J. Pakula. He was the elder brother of actor Richard Mulligan.Robert Mulligan, Director, Is Dead at 83: [Obituary (Obit); Biography] Fox, Margalit. New York Times 23 Dec 2008: B.10.  Early life and career  Mulligan studied at Fordham University before serving with the United States Marine Corps during World War II. At war's end, he obtained work in the editorial department of The New York Times, but left to pursue a career in television. Mulligan began his television career as a messenger boy for CBS television. He worked diligently, and by 1948 was directing major dramatic television shows. =Television= In the early 1950s he directed many episodes of Suspense. He followed this directing for The Philco Television Playhouse, Armstrong Circle Theatre, The Alcoa Hour, The United States Steel Hour, Studio One in Hollywood, Goodyear Playhouse and The Seven Lively Arts.  Feature film career: 1950s‚Äì1960s  In 1957 Mulligan directed his first motion picture, Fear Strikes Out, starring Anthony Perkins as tormented baseball player Jimmy Piersall. The film was the first feature he would direct alongside longtime collaborator Alan J. Pakula, then a big-time Hollywood producer. Pakula once confessed that \\"working with Bob set me back in directing several years because I enjoyed working with him, and we were having a good time, and I enjoyed the work.\\" Mulligan returned to television to direct episodes of Playhouse 90, Rendezvous, The Dupont Show of the Month, and TV versions of Ah, Wilderness! and The Moon and Sixpence. In 1959 he won an Emmy Award for directing The Moon and Sixpence, a television production that was the American small-screen debut of Laurence Olivier.Robert Mulligan's Aspirations: Hollywood Letter Upcoming Films Comment Counts By John C.

Mulligan then made two Rock Hudson vehicles, Come September and The Spiral Road. =Pakula collaboration= In the early 1960s, Pakula returned to Mulligan with the proposition of directing To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee. Mulligan accepted the offer despite the awareness that \\"the other studios didn't want it because what's it about? It's about a middle-aged lawyer with two kids. There's no romance, no violence (except off-screen). There's no action. What is there? Where's the story?\\" With the help of a screenplay by Horton Foote as well as the pivotal casting of Gregory Peck in the role of Atticus Finch, the film became a huge hit, and Mulligan was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. Mulligan and Pakula followed To Kill a Mockingbird with five more films. Love With the Proper Stranger (1963), starred Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen.HOLLYWOOD 'HOME': Director Robert Mulligan Recreates Atmosphere of His Native Bronx Slice of Life Gleaming Kitchen By MURRAY SCHUMACH. New York Times 21 Apr 1963: X7. Baby the Rain Must Fall (1965) starred McQueen. Inside Daisy Clover (1965) starred Wood. Up the Down Staircase (1967) was based on a humorous novel by Bel Kaufman and starred Sandy Dennis as the schoolteacher Sylvia Barrett. The Stalking Moon (1968), based on a Western novel by T.V. Olsen and reuniting Mulligan and Pakula with Peck, this time in the role of Sam Varner, a scout who attempts to escort a white woman (Eva Marie Saint) and her half-Indian son to New Mexico after they are pursued by a bloodthirsty Apache. After this film, Pakula broke ties with Mulligan to pursue his own career in directing. Up the Down Staircase was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival.  1970s  Mulligan began the 1970s with The Pursuit of Happiness (1971), based on the 1968 novel by Thomas Rogers, which had been a finalist for the National Book Award. The film starred Michael Sarrazin as William Popper, a college student (disillusioned with both right-wing and left-wing American politics) whose life is complicated when he accidentally runs over and kills an elderly woman and is quickly sentenced to one year in prison for vehicular manslaughter. He then contemplates breaking out of prison and fleeing the country with his girlfriend (played by Barbara Hershey), since neither feels their lives have made any significant difference in America.Inside Robert Mulligan Taylor, John Russell. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 40, Iss. 4, (Fall 1971): 215. Also in 1971, Mulligan released Summer of '42 (1971), which was based on the coming-of-age novel by Herman Raucher and starred Gary Grimes as a teenage stand-in for Raucher who spends a summer vacation in 1942 on Nantucket Island lusting after a young woman (Jennifer O'Neill) whose husband has shipped off to fight in the war. A box office smash, Summer of '42 went on to gross over $20 million, and Mulligan was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director. Summer of '42 was followed by The Other (1972), a thriller film scripted by former Hollywood actor Thomas Tryon from his own book. It told the story of two 9-year old boys, Niles and Holland Perry (played by real-life twins Chris and Marty Udvarnoky), who get involved in a series of grisly murders at their home on Peaquot Landing in the 1930s. Although the film was not an immediate success at the box office, it has since gone on to gain a steady cult following. In the mid-1970s, Mulligan was briefly engaged in talks with producers Julia and Michael Phillips to direct Taxi Driver (1976), with Jeff Bridges to star as the psychotic Travis Bickle. Objections posed by screenwriter Paul Schrader caused the project to be turned over to Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro instead. Schrader later elaborated on his disapproval of Mulligan as the film's director: \\"I was fighting that off because it didn't make any sense to me. Yet it was a deal, and God knows I wanted to see the film made. To Michael and Julia's credit, they were not keen on this either, but it was something that was around and that could have gone... You can write the most complex character, and if the director isn't a complex man, it won't be a complex character on the screen. Travis Bickle is very complex, full of contradictions. If Mulligan, [Robert] Aldrich or [Mark] Rydell had directed that, it would have been a very simple person; they don't make complex people. If they do, they end up cardboard complex, lacking in passion.\\" Unable to direct Taxi Driver, Mulligan proceeded by rounding out the 1970s with three films dominated by performances from A-list Hollywood actors: Jason Miller as a Los Angeles locksmith threatened by hitmen in The Nickel Ride (1974); Richard Gere as an Italian-American youth trying to break from his working-class family in Bloodbrothers (1978); and Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn portraying George and Doris, a pair of long-term adulterers, in Same Time Next Year (1978), based on the play by Bernard Slade.  1980s  As the 1980s dawned, Mulligan found work harder to come by, succeeding in directing only two films by the end of the decade. He had started directing Rich and Famous for MGM but asked to be replaced after a week of shooting; George Cukor replaced him.FILM CLIPS: CUKOR STEPS IN FOR ROBERT MULLIGAN FILM CLIPS. Pollock, Dale. Los Angeles Times 22 Oct 1980: h1. Kiss Me Goodbye (1982), starring Sally Field, James Caan and Jeff Bridges, was an attempt at a comedic remake of the Brazilian film Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands, and was critically derided,CRITICS KISS 'KISS' GOODBYE. Los Angeles Times 16 Jan 1983: l20. although it was a modest commercial success. Clara's Heart (1988), starring Whoopi Goldberg and a young Neil Patrick Harris, was released five years later to negative box office numbers and reviews, and was panned on television by Siskel and Ebert. It has, however, received recent praise from film professor Robert Keser.  1990s  In the 1990s, at the age of 66, Mulligan would release his final film, The Man in the Moon (1991), starring a 14-year-old Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut. The film was praised by Roger Ebert, who included it at #8 in his Top 10 list of the best films of 1991, declaring, \\"Nothing else [Mulligan] has done... approaches the purity and perfection of The Man in the Moon... (with a) poetic, bittersweet tone, and avoid(ing) the sentimentalism and cheap emotion that could have destroyed this story.\\" Later in March 1992, Mulligan made headlines when he angrily took his name off of airline cuts of The Man in the Moon, after he had learned that the film would be heavily censored by American and Delta flights. In an interview with Ebert, Mulligan explained, \\"The airlines demanded so many excessive and unreasonable cuts and changes that I took my name off the film... it's the first time I've ever done that.\\" Before his death in 2008, Mulligan had commissioned playwright Beth Henley to write a screenplay from the novel A Long and Happy Life by Reynolds Price, which Mulligan had bought the rights to with his own money. The film was never made.  Personal life  Mulligan's first wife was Jane Lee Sutherland. Their marriage lasted from 1951 to 1968 and produced three children. His second marriage, to Sandy Mulligan, lasted from 1971 until his death. He was the elder brother of actor Richard Mulligan, whom he cast in Love with the Proper Stranger. It has been reported that Mulligan battled alcoholism for a period of years. During the making of To Kill a Mockingbird, he and the rest of the crew were also known to be excessive chain-smokers, much to the annoyance of producer Pakula. Death Mulligan died of heart disease at his home in Lyme, Connecticut on December 20, 2008, at the age of 83. Style Mulligan described his role as a director thusly: ‚ÄúThings have to sift through me. That's me up there on the screen. The shooting, the editing, the use of music‚Äîall that represents my attitude toward the material.‚Äù In a 1978 interview with the Village Voice, he insisted, \\"I don't know anything about 'the Mulligan style.' If you can find it, well, that's your job.\\" Chicago critic Jonathan Rosenbaum once hailed Mulligan as: Critic and filmmaker Fran√ßois Truffaut also championed the director's work. Truffaut was, in particular, a fan of Fear Strikes Out and was impressed that it was only Mulligan's first feature, writing, \\"It is rare to see a first film so free of faults and bombast.\\" Summing up Mulligan's talents as a whole, Truffaut concluded: Another filmmaker who admired Mulligan's work was Stanley Kubrick, who featured a clip from Summer of '42 in The Shining (1980). Of his fellow filmmakers, Mulligan admired Ingmar Bergman for his \\"wonderful use of that simple, honest technique\\" of allowing the camera to \\"rest on a human face quietly, unobtrusively, and let something happen.\\" He championed the films of Satyajit Ray and joined in a protest with Bergman and David Lean when Ray's film, Charulata, was rejected at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. Mulligan also had his critics.

Early life Potter was born in Schenectady, New York on April 25, 1825. Potter was the eldest of seven children (six boys and one daughter) born to Sarah (n√©e Nott) Potter (1799‚Äì1839) and Episcopalian Bishop Alonzo Potter (1800‚Äì1865) of Pennsylvania. After his mother's death in April 1839 from complications arising from giving birth to their seventh child (and only daughter), his father remarried in 1840 (to his mother's cousin Sara Benedict) and had three more children, all boys. Sara died in 1864 and his father remarried for the third time to Frances Seton, just three months before his death in July 1865. Among his siblings were brothers Howard Potter, a New York City banker, Robert Brown Potter, a General in the American Civil War (to whom he gifted a house known as \\"The Rocks\\" in Newport, Rhode Island), Edward Tuckerman Potter, an architect who designed the Nott Memorial at Union College, Henry Codman Potter, who succeeded Horatio Potter as Bishop of New York in 1887, Eliphalet Nott Potter, who served as President of Union College and Hobart College, and William Appleton Potter (1842‚Äì1909), also an architect who designed the Church of the Presidents in Elberon, New Jersey. His mother was the only daughter of Eliphalet Nott, who served as the longtime president of Union College. His paternal grandparents were Joseph Potter and Anne Brown (n√©e Knight) Potter and his uncle was Horatio Potter, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Potter graduated from Union College in 1842, and completed his qualifications as a civil engineer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1843. Career After qualifying as a civil engineer, Potter relocated to Wisconsin, where he worked as an engineer and surveyor. Potter then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1846 and returned to New York where he commenced the practice of law in New York City. In 1868, he was elected as a Democrat to represent New York's 10th District in the 41st United States Congress. He was reelected to the 42nd and 43rd Congresses, the last term from the 11th District, and served from March 4, 1869 to March 3, 1875. He did not run for reelection in 1874. In 1876, Potter again elected to the House, and represented New York's 12th District in the 45th Congress, serving from March 4, 1877 to March 3, 1879. During this term Potter was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads. He did not run for reelection in 1878. Potter was President of the New York State Democratic Conventions in 1875 and 1877, and he was a Delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1872 and 1876. He ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1879. From 1863 to 1882, Potter was a trustee of Union College. He was President of the American Bar Association from 1881 until the time of his death in January 1882. Personal life In 1851, Potter was married to Virginia Mitchell (1827‚Äì1890) of Philadelphia, the daughter of Matthew and Louisa (n√©e Kidd) Mitchell. The Potters owned a country house, known as \\"Nutwood\\", two miles from Trinity Church in New Rochelle, overlooking the Long Island Sound. Together, they were the parents of: * Maria Louisa Potter (1855‚Äì1882), who married Joseph Leslie Cotton of Boston in 1881.

Only Australians are eligible for the award. History The Aurealis Award was established in 1995 by Chimaera Publications, the publishers of Aurealis Magazine. Unlike the other major Australian speculative fiction award, the Ditmar Award, it divides work into subgenre and age categories, and is judged as such. The award was originally given out in the following divisions: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, and Young Adult. Two separate awards are given in each of those divisions, one for novels and one for short stories. A fifth division for Children's books was added in 2001 for fiction for 8-12 year olds, with separate awards for \\"Short Fiction\\" and \\"Long Fiction\\". With the 2008 Awards the \\"Short Fiction\\" children's fiction category became a category for \\"Illustrated Work/Picture Book\\". For the 2010 Awards, the two categories became one for children's fiction told primarily through pictures and another for children's fiction told primarily through words. For the 2013 Awards, the two categories were merged into a single category for children's books. The Young Adult and Children's categories cover books in all three speculative fiction genres. Submissions within a division are reviewed by a three judge panel, which selects each year's finalists and winners for their respective division. One of the judges on each panel is also the panel Convenor. Two changes to the award structure were introduced in 2004. The awards became administered by Fantastic Queensland, a volunteer group that promotes Australian speculative fiction. A new division was added, Golden Aurealis, for both short stories and books, drawn from the winners of the other divisions. There is also an associated Peter McNamara Conveners' Award for Excellence for \\"a particular achievement in speculative fiction or related areas in the relevant year, but may also take into account achievements over a number of years. This may also be for a non-fiction work, a collection or anthology, an art work, or for a body of work that brings credit and/or attention to the speculative fiction genre in that year\\". The award was originally known as the Convenors' Award for Excellence and was renamed in 2002 after Peter McNamara (d. 2004), the original award Convenor, shortly after he was diagnosed with an incurable disease. It is given out at the discretion of the Convenors. After six years of being the administrator, Fantastic Queensland ended their partnership with Chimaera Publications. On May 18, 2010 it was announced that Chimaera had entered a new deal with SpecFaction NSW who would administer the awards for 2010. Later in 2010 SpecFaction NSW announced that they reached a deal with HarperVoyager to be the exclusive sponsor for the 2010 Awards which would be held in May 2011. After three years of running the awards, SpecFaction NSW, decided they would not continue hosting the awards. On the 7th of May 2013 it was announced that Chimaera Publications had reached an agreement with Conflux Inc, who will host the awards for the next two years. In addition, the awards ceremony would be held in Canberra. In May 2015 it was announced that the Western Australian Science Fiction Foundation (WASFF) would be overseeing the awards for the next three years. In 2016, the short story categories for science fiction, fantasy, and horror were subdivided into categories for short story and novella. Categories =Current awards= *Best anthology: 2008 to present *Best children‚Äôs fiction: 2013 to present (merging two previous categories) *Best collection: 2008 to present *Best fantasy novel: 1995 to present *Best fantasy novella: 2016 (for 2015 awards) *Best fantasy short story: 1995 to present *Best horror novel: 1995 to present *Best horror novella: 2016 (for 2015 awards) *Best horror short story: 1995 to present *Best illustrated book/graphic novel: 2008 to present *Best science fiction novel: 1995 to present *Best science fiction novella: 2016 (for 2015 awards) *Best science fiction short story: 1995 to present *Best young adult novel: 1995 to present *Best young adult short story: 1995 to present *Convenors' Award for excellence: 1998 to present *Sara Douglass Book Series Award: 2015 Also presented at Aurealis Awards ceremonies since the 2009 awards, although not officially an Aurealis Award, is the Kris Hembury Encouragement Award. During the years 2001 to 2007 the category \\"best children‚Äôs illustrated work/picture book\\" was simply known as \\"best children‚Äôs short fiction\\" and \\"best children's novel\\" was known as \\"best children's long fiction\\". From 1998 to 2000 the Peter McNamara Convenors' Award for excellence was known simply as the Convenors' Award for excellence but was changed in honour of Peter McNamara the original convenor. In earlier years the eligibility period was 1 November to 31 October, rather than the current 1 January to 31 December.

Xingwen Zhao, Fangguo Zhang. \\"Traitor Tracing against Public Collaboration\\". 2011\\\\. p. 2. Traitor tracing is a copyright infringement detection system which works by tracing the source of leaked files rather than by direct copy protection. The method is that the distributor adds a unique salt to each copy given out. When a copy of it is leaked to the public, the distributor can check the value on it and trace it back to the \\"leak\\". Primary methods =Activation controls= The main concept is that each licensee (the user) is given a unique key which unlocks the software or allows the media to be decrypted. If the key is made public, the content owner then knows exactly who did it from their database of assigned codes. A major attack on this strategy is the key generator (keygen). By reverse engineering the software, the code used to recognise a valid key can be characterised and then a program to spit out valid keys on command can be made. The practice of traitor tracing is most often implemented with computer software, and evolved from the previous method of activation codes. In this model, each box of software ships with a unique activation number on a sticker or label that can only be read after the package is opened, separate from the CD-ROM or a DVD-ROM. This number is an encoded serial number, expanded to a usually large number or string of letters, digits, and hyphens. When the software is being installed, or the first time it is run, the user is prompted to type in the license code. This code is then decoded back to its base serial number. This process reduces the number in complexity, and the additional information removed by this process is used to verify the authenticity of the serial number. If the user mistypes a single character in what is sometimes a very long code, the software will refuse to install and require the number to be retyped until it is correct. This activation code is generated during the packaging phase of manufacture, so that every user is receiving the same software but a different activation code. If a user performs a \\"casual copy\\" of the software for a friend, that friend must have the license code as well as the software to install it on their system. Since the software itself cannot determine that it is a copy, this is a way to beat this basic system. With the expansion of computer networking, two additional levels of software protection have evolved, \\"network registration\\" and \\"online registration\\". =Network registration= Software that employs this additional security keeps a copy of the actual serial number being used in the license code. When it is active, it is broadcasting this number on a clandestine channel on the local network. If the software has been installed on another computer on that same network, using the same license code, when the second copy is run it will detect its serial number in use on the network and typically will refuse to run. It may also cause the other copy of itself already in use to close. This prevents a small business from buying one copy of expensive software and installing it on several of the computers at their location, provided they are networked. =Online registration= The process of online registration is very similar to activation codes, but adds an additional step. Most modern companies are now not only internally networked, but are also connected to the internet. This allows the software manufacturers to add an additional check to their system during the installation process. When the user enters a valid license code, the software does not immediately install. Instead, it uses the active internet connection to contact a server being operated by the software manufacturer. The license code is transmitted to the server, and it waits for the server to tell it whether the install should be permitted. The server maintains a database of all the serial numbers that have been used to install their software. If a single serial number is used on a number of machines (a typical limit would be five machines) then the server tells the software that it is likely a copy and to abort the installation. The users are usually presented with a dialog instructing them to contact the manufacturer. Watermarking Websites offering subscriber downloads may embed a digital watermark in the download, usually in a way that is not readily apparent to the user. For example, an identification number may be embedded in an image, or in metadata such as the date of a file. Other methods Some software that implements online registration extends this with a process commonly known as \\"phoning home\\". In this case, the software, either each time it is used or at some preset interval such as monthly, makes another connection back to the registration server. It does this to check in with the server to see if the serial number it is using has been determined to be one that is being used to install in many places. Serial numbers that have been identified as \\"pirated\\" (illegally distributed) are added to a blacklist on the server, a process referred to as being \\"burned\\". Burned serial numbers cannot be used to install or activate the product. Serial number lists are available on the internet that include a large number of valid registration codes for many software titles. It is common for software manufacturers to seek out these lists and invalidate the serial numbers that appear on these lists. This discourages individuals from giving out their registration codes for fear that this code will later be invalidated, disabling the original install of the software the next time that it \\"phones home\\". Some of the more expensive software requires the user to send personal information to the software vendor before receiving the activation code. The activation code is usually a large sequence of numbers and letters, and encodes information including the license serial number, information to ensure the code is valid, and also includes the ability to verify the personal information the user sent to the software vendor. In this way, the user's name or business name must be entered along with the registration code. The registration code will not be accepted by the software unless the user types in the business name exactly as submitted to the software vendor. The business name is usually displayed by the software on its opening banner whenever the software is used. If the customer gives away his activation code it will be useless without his business name, and anyone that uses the activation code must enter it in during the activation process, leaving the original buyer's business name on the banner of the software. This makes it very easy to \\"trace the traitor\\" and find any customers who originally gave out their activation codes. Since giving away the registration code is a violation of the license agreement, the software vendor may invalidate the user's serial number (disabling that user's software in the process) and may take legal action. This does raise privacy concerns in some areas.

Gilbert, and it was through Gilbert that young Martin Harvey met his first teacher, John Ryder. Martin Harvey joined Henry Irving's Lyceum Theatre company in 1882. For many years he played only minor parts in Irving's productions. His most famous play was first produced at the Lyceum on 16 February 1899. This was The Only Way, an adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities in which Martin Harvey played the lead role of Sydney Carton. Many other plays followed and many tours in both Great Britain and North America. His success was always greater in Canada than the United States. After Irving's death in 1905, Martin Harvey continued to revive his old manager's plays, often using Irving's own props which he had bought. These plays included The Bells and The Lyons Mail. His early successes included Pelleas in Maeterlinck's Pelleas and Melisande, with Mrs. Patrick Campbell as Melisande and incidental music written for the production by Gabriel Faur√©. His later successes included A Cigarette-maker's Romance, Oedipus (in Max Reinhardt's Covent Garden production), Shaw's The Devil's Disciple and Maeterlinck's The Burgomaster of Stilemonde. By the time he retired, Martin Harvey claimed to have performed The Only Way more than 3,000 times, though this would not have been possible in reality. Early days Early on in Irving's company, when cast as the attendant to the messenger in the scene with Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing, Martin Harvey decided that here was his opportunity to be more than a mere extra with a non-speaking part . \\"I bought a remarkable feather\\", he explained, \\"and wore it in my hat, and on the day of the dress rehearsal I painted on my face a very elaborate moustache. Alas! my efforts were unavailing. I expect in Irving critical eyes I was a figure of fun. Irving pointed his lean forefinger at me, and with that dreadful preliminary, 'Ha, hm,' of his, he growled. Take out that boy.' I had to come on with the crowd as usual.\\"Edgar, cited in ‚ÄòA Lyceum Young Man‚Äô, Hull Daily Mail, 5 July 1912 p. 6 \\"The Only Way\\" Martin Harvey and his wife Angelita worked on an adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities, later involving playwright Freeman Wills and Irish clergyman Canon Frederick Langbridge. There was already a play called Sidney Carton, or a Tale of Two Cities and it was Angelita who came up with the title The Only Way. The Only Way was made into a film in 1927 shot at Twickenham Studios and was a commercial success. It starred Martin Harvey in the lead role.  Business interests One of Martin Harvey's personal friends was theatre manager, William Morton. In 1902 Morton's Ltd was formed to build the Alexandra Theatre in Hull. Martin Harvey was made one of five directors, investing ¬£1,000, and remained so until the theatre was sold in 1935. Martin Harvey and his touring company paid an annual visit to Hull and to Morton's theatres, which also included the Theatre Royal and The Grand Opera House.Morton, William: 'Some Famous Stage Celebrities', I Remember'. Hull: Goddard, Walker and Brown, 1934 pp. 120-121 Personal life In 1889 he married Angelita Helena Maria de Silva Ferro, daughter of a Chilean consul and a fellow actor in Irving's company who used the stage name Miss N. de Silva. They had two children, Muriel Martin-Harvey and Michael Martin- Harvey, both successful actors. John Martin Harvey died at his home in East Sheen, Richmond, Surrey, aged 80. Great War During the Great War, Martin Harvey and his wife toured the country giving military recruitment lectures and raising money for the Red Cross and other charities, most notably the Nation's Fund for Nurses. The couple raised enough money to buy a building for the College of Nursing in 1920 which became a rest home for nurses.Profile, Hopwood, Jon C., 'John Martin Harvey, Biography', imdb.com; accessed 11 August 2016.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 8, 1998. When the family spend the day at Lake Springfield, Homer meets Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger (voicing themselves), who are hiding from the media in their secluded summer home. Homer starts to work for them, developing a good friendship, but he soon reveals their secrets to the public, damaging his new friendship with them. It was the last Simpsons episode written by Richard Appel, and was directed by Pete Michels.  Plot  Bart and Lisa persuade their parents to spend the day at Lake Springfield. While there, Homer attempts parasailing and is involved in an accident when he tells Marge to send him up far too high; as a result, his rope detaches. He crashes through a skylight and into the bedroom of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger's secluded summer home. The couple and Homer become acquainted. Homer convinces the couple to allow him to be their assistant, while keeping it secret that the celebrity couple are in Springfield. Homer, at first, works well with the couple, and they all become good friends. Homer scares Ron Howard when he visits the couple, and soon attempts to pitch a screenplay about a \\"killer robot driving instructor that travels back in time for some reason,\\" as well as a talking pie, the robot's best friend. Both his attempts at writing for the couple are unsuccessful. Due to his inability to keep a secret, Homer eventually releases the information that Baldwin and Basinger are in Springfield, and the couple's house is discovered by Springfield citizens and the media. Baldwin and Basinger are furious at Homer for breaking their trust, and immediately end their friendship with him and kick him out of their house, and Homer sadly walks to the gate while being pelted with rocks by the citizens. Bitter about losing his celebrity friends and once again feeling like a nobody, Homer begins a mobile museum, entitled \\"Museum of Hollywood Jerks\\", which displays the couple's personal belongings in an attempt to expose them as being selfish and uncaring. Basinger, Baldwin, and Howard discover the museum while intending to apologize to Homer. A high-speed chase quickly ensues between Homer, in his mobile museum, and the celebrities in their Hummer. Homer agrees to stop after Ron Howard is injured during the chase. Homer is ordered by a court of law to remain 500 miles away from any celebrity, both living or dead. One month later, Ron Howard pitches Homer's screenplay from earlier to Brian Grazer of 20th Century Fox, and over a still of Howard rejoicing over securing the deal, a snippet of the theme song of Happy Days is played.  Production  Ron Howard guest starred as himself in the episode During the opening sequence, Bart originally wrote \\"butt.com\\" on the chalkboard, however, it was modified to butt.butt, due to butt.com being a real website. The storyline of famous celebrities moving to Springfield was pitched by Mike Scully; Scully originally pitched Bruce Springsteen as the celebrity to move to town, however, Springsteen turned down the opportunity to appear. Richard Appel then offered the guest appearance opportunity to Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, but they too turned down the offer. Appel then offered Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger the opportunity to provide their voices, and they agreed to guest star in the episode. The episode was originally intended to be directed by Mike B. Anderson, but it was held over from season 9 and Pete Michels directed it. In December 2008, in an interview, Ron Howard commented that guest voicing himself \\"was an honour. Probably, from my kids' perspective, my coolest turn.\\" Howard once again guest starred on The Simpsons as himself in the season eleven episode \\"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\\" (1999). Howard was set to appear in \\"Children of a Lesser Clod\\" (2001), but dropped out for unknown reasons. The author of the 2003 book Ron Howard: From Mayberry to the Moon‚Ä¶ and Beyond, Beverly Gray, noted that by playing himself in these episodes, \\"Howard showed once again that he could laugh at his own public persona. His appearances on The Simpsons also suggest how much he remains an American icon, long after the end of his acting career. It's rare indeed for a director or producer to be as instantly recognizable as most Hollywood stars.\\" One gag near the end of the episode had a sign with the 20th Century Fox logo on it with the line \\"A Division of Walt Disney Co\\" under it. On December 14, 2017, Disney announced its intention to purchase 20th Century Fox's parent company, 21st Century Fox, which was completed on March 20, 2019.  Cultural references The episode title is a reference to the 1940 film Pinocchio, which features the song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". At the beginning of the episode, Homer has a dream that is a spoof of Hanna-Barbera's series The Yogi Bear Show (1961), with Homer as Yogi Bear, Bart as Boo Boo and Ned as Ranger Smith. He then dreams he is Magilla Gorilla and mauls Mr. Peebles after he takes his banana. The time machine drawing in Homer's screenplay contains a Flux capacitor, the device from the film Back to the Future (1985). The drinks wobbling as the townspeople approach Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin's house is a reference to the film Jurassic Park (1993). Posters for 9¬Ω Weeks (1986) and L.A. Confidential (1997), both starring Basinger, are seen in Homer's museum. At the end of the episode, Brian Grazer has a poster of the movie Titanic (1997) in his office. Apu's quote 'you flying fat man' is a reference to the Emperor's line in the cult film Dune 'bring in that floating fat man.'  Reception  \\"When You Dish Upon a Star\\" finished 32nd in the weekly ratings for the week of November 2‚Äì8, 1998 with a Nielsen rating of 9.2. In his review of The Simpsons' tenth season, James Plath of Dvdtown.com noted \\"When You Dish upon a Star\\" was written to be \\"one of the funnier episodes\\". In a Simpsons flashback review, Robert Canning of IGN reviewed the episode positively, commenting \\"I'm not saying this episode is one of the greatest the series has ever produced, but it is very, very funny, and it features one of my all-time favorite guest performances.\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote in a negative review: \\"Despite three very high-profile guest actors, this episode is really rather dull and uninspired. The only real moment of interest is the car chase at the end, and Kim Basinger's delightfully self-deprecating quips about her constant adoration of her Oscars, Alec Baldwin apparently not having one himself.\\" IGN rated Ron Howard as the twelfth-greatest guest appearance on The Simpsons. Total Film's Nathan Ditum ranked Baldwin and Basinger's performances as the second-best guest appearances in the show's history.

Sh≈çwa Steel Works began as the Anshan Iron & Steel Works, a subsidiary of the South Manchurian Railway Company in 1918.Yoshihisa Tak Matsusaka, The Making of Japanese Manchuria, 1904-1932 (2001), p.222-3. The city of Anshan in Liaoning was chosen for its proximity to the Takushan iron ore deposits and rail works at Mukden. The company used low grade iron; in 1934 it mined 950,000 tonnes. In 1933, after a reorganization, it was renamed the Sh≈çwa Steel Works. Sh≈çwa Steel produced pig iron and steel, and the steel mill was soon surrounded by a large industrial complex of other factories to produce a variety of metal products. Sumitomo Steel Pipe established a plant to produce steel pipes, and Manchurian Roll Manufacturing Company to produce steel mill rolls. To feed the furnaces, coal mines were established at Fushun, 35 kilometers to the east, which also led to electric power plants, coal liquefaction plants, cement works, brick kilns. By the end of the 1930s, there were over 780 Japanese industrial plants in Fengtian province.Young, Japan's Total Empire, pp, 203 In 1937, under the direction of the Kwangtung Army, Japanese industrialist Yoshisuke Aikawa organized a holding company called the Manchurian Industrial Development Company (\\"Mangy≈ç\\"), a Manchukuo zaibatsu with major shareholdings in the South Manchuria Railway, co-owned by Nissan and Manchukuo. The new zaibatsu invested heavily in Sh≈çwa Steel, and took a controlling interest.Beasley, Japanese Imperialism 1894-1945 pp.216 As part of the new business plan, Sh≈çwa Steel licensed the Krupp-Renn process from German steel makers, and sent people to Nazi Germany for training from September 1937. Equipment received from Krupp was installed by 1939, greatly increasing production efficiencies.Kudo, Japanese-German Business Relations, pp.93 Total production of processed iron in Manchuria reached 1,000,000 tonnes in 1931-32, of which almost half was made by Sh≈çwa Steel; iron production grew to 7,000,000 of tonnes in 1938. In 1941, Sh≈çwa Steel Works had a total capacity production of 1,750,000 tonnes of iron bars and 1,000,000 tonnes of processed steel. By 1942, Sh≈çwa Steel Works total production capacity reached 3,600,000 tonnes, making it one of the major iron and steel centers in the world.Beasley, Japanese Imperialism 1894-1945 It was therefore of strategic importance in the Pacific War, and was subject to constant attack by B-29 Superfortress strategic bombers of the USAAF. Imperial Japanese Army detached the 1st Chutai (unit) of 104th Sentai (squadron) of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, to Anshan, with other air squadrons for industrial defense purposes. Although this unit was equipped with modern Nakajima Ki-84 Ia (Mansh≈´ Type) \\"Hayate\\" Frank fighters, manufactured by Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company, the plant suffered heavy damage from the air raids, losing up to 30% of its capacity.Astor, The Jungle War, pp. 312 After the end of the war, Workers' and Peasants' Red Army forces dismantled anything that was left of Sh≈çwa Steel Works and shipped it to the Soviet Union. The Chinese communists then occupied the ruins, and rebuilt the factory into the Anshan Iron & Steel Works, which remains one of the major steel producing plants in modern China. As a side note, on one of the B-29 Superfortress missions, an aircraft commanded by Captain Howard Jarrel suffered engine damage through a Japanese antiaircraft burst over the Anshan target zone. Rather than crash-land in Japanese-held territory, he decided to land in Vladivostok, two hours to the northeast, in the Soviet Far East. As the Soviet Union was still neutral in the Pacific War, when the bomber landed, all crewmen were immediately arrested and the aircraft confiscated. This incident led to the development of the Soviet Tu-4 \\"Bull\\" bomber, a reverse- engineered copy of the B-29.Daso, U,S, Air Force, pp. 253 References  Notes Japanese companies established in 1918 Companies in Manchukuo Iron and steel mills of Japan Defunct companies of Japan Anshan ","title":"Showa Steel Works"},{"id":"1790571","text":"Tofurky Tofurkey (a portmanteau of tofu and turkey) is faux turkey, a meat substitute in the form of a loaf or casserole of vegetarian protein, usually made from tofu (soybean protein) or seitan (wheat protein) with a stuffing made from grains or bread, flavored with a broth and seasoned with herbs and spices.

Restoration ecology is the scientific study supporting the practice of ecological restoration, which is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention and action. Effective restoration requires an explicit goal or policy, preferably an unambiguous one that is articulated, accepted, and codified. Restoration goals reflect societal choices from among competing policy priorities, but extracting such goals is typically contentious and politically challenging. Natural ecosystems provide ecosystem services in the form of resources such as food, fuel, and timber; the purification of air and water; the detoxification and decomposition of wastes; the regulation of climate; the regeneration of soil fertility; and the pollination of crops. These ecosystem processes have been estimated to be worth trillions of dollars annually. There is consensus in the scientific community that the current environmental degradation and destruction of many of the Earth's biota are taking place on a \\"catastrophically short timescale\\". Scientists estimate that the current species extinction rate, or the rate of the Holocene extinction, is 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the normal, background rate. Habitat loss is the leading cause of both species extinctions and ecosystem service decline. Two methods have been identified to slow the rate of species extinction and ecosystem service decline, they are the conservation of currently viable habitat and the restoration of degraded habitat. The commercial applications of ecological restoration have increased exponentially in recent years. The United Nations General Assembly (01.03.2019) declared 2021‚Äì 2030 the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Definition Restoration ecology is the academic study of the process, whereas ecological restoration is the actual project or process by restoration practitioners. The Society for Ecological Restoration defines \\"ecological restoration\\" as an \\"intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability\\". Ecological restoration includes a wide scope of projects including erosion control, reforestation, removal of non-native species and weeds, revegetation of disturbed areas, daylighting streams, the reintroduction of native species (preferably native species that have local adaptation), and habitat and range improvement for targeted species. For many researchers, the ecological restoration must include the local communities: they call this process the \\"social-ecological restoration\\".Fern√°ndez‚ÄêManjarr√©s, J.F., Roturier, S. and Bilhaut, A.‚ÄêG.

Wilson, a biologist, states, \\"Here is the means to end the great extinction spasm. The next century will, I believe, be the era of restoration in ecology.\\" History Restoration ecology emerged as a separate field in ecology in the late twentieth century. The term was coined by John Aber and William Jordan III when they were at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. However, indigenous peoples, land managers, stewards, and laypeople have been practicing ecological restoration or ecological management for thousands of years. Considered the birthplace of modern ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Arboretum. Civilian Conservation Corps workers replanted nearby prairie species onto a former horse pasture, overseen by university faculty including renowned ecologist Aldo Leopold, botanist Theodore Sperry, mycologist Henry C. Greene, and plant ecologist John T. Curtis. Curtis and his graduate students surveyed the whole of Wisconsin, documenting native species communities and creating the first species lists for tallgrass restorations. Existing prairie remnants, such as locations within pioneer cemeteries and railroad rights-of-way, were located and inventoried by Curtis and his team. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm, and pioneering techniques like prescribed burning. The latter half of the 20th century saw the growth of ecological restoration beyond Wisconsin borders. The 285-hectare Green Oaks Biological Field Station at Knox College began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologist Paul Shepard. It was followed by the 40-hectare Schulenberg Prairie at the Morton Arboretum, which started in 1962 by Ray Schulenberg and Bob Betz. Betz then worked with The Nature Conservancy to establish the 260-hectare Fermi National Laboratory tallgrass prairie in 1974. These major tallgrass restoration projects marked the growth of ecological restoration from isolated studies to widespread practice. Australia has also been the site of historically significant ecological restoration projects. In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 Albert Morris and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the Broken Hill Regeneration Area.Jordan, William R. & Lubick, George M. (2012) Making Nature Whole: A History of Ecological Restoration. Washington, D.C. Island Press. pp. 71‚Äì75Ardill, Peter J. (2017) \\"Albert Morris and the Broken Hill regeneration area: time, landscape and renewal.\\" Australian Association of Bush Regenerators (AABR). Sydney http://www.aabr.org.au/morris-broken-hill/  Theoretical foundations  Restoration ecology draws on a wide range of ecological concepts. = Disturbance = Disturbance is a change in environmental conditions that disrupt the functioning of an ecosystem. Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities. For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement fire as a natural disturbance regime. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystems. = Succession = Ecological succession is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with a few dominant pioneer species to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance. Following mild to moderate natural and anthropogenic disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories through careful management. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (such as in urban ecosystems), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes. = Fragmentation = Habitat fragmentation describes spatial discontinuities in a biological system, where ecosystems are broken up into smaller parts through land-use changes (e.g. agriculture) and natural disturbance. This both reduces the size of the population and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases the quality of the habitat. The edge of a fragment has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating habitat corridors that link isolated fragments. Reversing the effects of fragmentation is an important component of restoration ecology. = Ecosystem function = Ecosystem function describes the most basic and essential foundational processes of any natural systems, including nutrient cycles and energy fluxes. An understanding of the complexity of these ecosystem functions is necessary to address any ecological processes that may be degraded. Ecosystem functions are emergent properties of the system as a whole, thus monitoring and management are crucial for the long-term stability of ecosystems. A completely self-perpetuating and fully functional ecosystem is the ultimate goal of restorative efforts. We must understand what ecosystem properties influence others to restore desired functions and reach this goal. = Community assembly = Community assembly \\"is a framework that can unify virtually all of (community) ecology under a single conceptual umbrella\\". Community assembly theory attempts to explain the existence of environmentally similar sites with differing assemblages of species. It assumes that species have similar niche requirements, so that community formation is a product of random fluctuations from a common species pool. Essentially, if all species are fairly ecologically equivalent, then random variation in colonization, and migration and extinction rates between species, drive differences in species composition between sites with comparable environmental conditions. = Population genetics = Genetic diversity has shown to be as important as species diversity for restoring ecosystem processes. Hence ecological restorations are increasingly factoring genetic processes into management practices. Population genetic processes that are important to consider in restored populations include founder effects, inbreeding depression, outbreeding depression, genetic drift, and gene flow. Such processes can predict whether or not a species successfully establishes at a restoration site.  Applications  = Leaf litter accumulation = Leaf litter accumulation plays an important role in the restoration process. Higher quantities of leaf litter hold higher humidity levels, a key factor for the establishment of plants. The process of accumulation depends on factors like wind and species composition of the forest. The leaf litter found in primary forests is more abundant, deeper, and holds more humidity than in secondary forests. These technical considerations are important to take into account when planning a restoration project . = Soil heterogeneity effects on community heterogeneity = Spatial heterogeneity of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity, and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated soil resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass prairie restoration project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which on its own was insufficient to ensure species diversity in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings were consistent with the theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, best adapted to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure. = Invasion and restoration = Restoration is used as a tool for reducing the spread of invasive plant species many ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread. As this approach emphasizes the control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects. The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat. These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density. They are not always actively managed following seeding. The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. An example of this is through the use of biological control agents (such as herbivorous insects) which suppress invasive weed species while restoration practitioners concurrently seed in native plant species that take advantage of the freed resources. These approaches have been shown to be effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a sustainable solution long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding. Restoration projects are also used as a way to better understand what makes an ecological community resistant to invasion. As restoration projects have a broad range of implementation strategies and methods used to control invasive species, they can be used by ecologists to test theories about invasion. Restoration projects have been used to understand how the diversity of the species introduced in the restoration affects invasion. We know that generally higher diversity prairies have lower levels of invasion. The incorporation of functional ecology has shown that more functionally diverse restorations have lower levels of invasion. Furthermore, studies have shown that using native species functionally similar to invasive species are better able to compete with invasive species. Restoration ecologists have also used a variety of strategies employed at different restoration sites to better understand the most successful management techniques to control invasion. = Successional trajectories = Progress along a desired successional pathway may be difficult if multiple stable states exist. Looking over 40 years of wetland restoration data, Kl√∂tzli and Gootjans (2001) argue that unexpected and undesired vegetation assemblies \\"may indicate that environmental conditions are not suitable for target communities\\". Succession may move in unpredicted directions, but constricting environmental conditions within a narrow range may rein in the possible successional trajectories and increase the likelihood of the desired outcome. = Sourcing material for restoration = For most restoration projects it is generally recommended to source material from local populations, to increase the chance of restoration success and minimize the effects of maladaptation. However the definition of local can vary based on species. habitat and region. US Forest Service recently developed provisional seed zones based on a combination of minimum winter temperature zones, aridity, and the Level III ecoregions. Rather than putting strict distance recommendations, other guidelines recommend sourcing seeds to match similar environmental conditions that the species is exposed to, either now, or under projected climate change. For example, sourcing for Castilleja levisecta found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations. Similarly, a suite of new methods are surveying gene-environment interactions in order to identify the optimum source populations based on genetic adaptation to environmental conditions. Principles Ecosystem restoration for the superb parrot on an abandoned railway line in Australia =Rationale= There are many reasons to restore ecosystems. Some include: *Restoring natural capital such as drinkable water or wildlife populations *Helping human communities and the ecosystems upon which they depend adapt to the impacts of climate change (through ecosystem-based adaptation) *Mitigating climate change (e.g. through carbon sequestration) *Helping threatened or endangered speciesSilva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., & Lucas, M. C. (2017). Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages? A test with lampreys. Ecological engineering, 102, 291-302 *Aesthetic reasons *Moral reasons: human intervention has unnaturally destroyed many habitats, and there exists an innate obligation to restore these destroyed habitats *Regulated use/harvest, particularly for subsistence *Cultural relevance of native ecosystems to Native people *The environmental health of nearby populations Forest restoration in action at the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project in South Africa There exist considerable differences of opinion on how to set restoration goals and how to define their success among conservation groups. Ultimately specifying the restoration target or desired state of an ecosystem is a societal choice, informed by scientists and technocrats, but ultimately it is a policy choice. Selecting the desired goal can be politically contentious. Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as rewilding. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, \\"ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium‚Ä¶. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target.\\" Some conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable in its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987). This is especially true in cases where the ecosystem services are central to the physical and cultural survival of human populations, as is the case with many Native groups in the United States and other communities around the world who subsist using ecological services and environmental resources. One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. Afforestation involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. Carbon dioxide is a leading cause of global warming (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities. Restored prairie at the West Eugene Wetlands in Eugene, Oregon.  Challenges  Some view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals. Hilderbrand et al. point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for 'complete' restoration are unreasonably short, while other critical markers for full-scale restoration are either ignored or abridged due to feasibility concerns.Hilderbrand, R. H., A. C. Watts, and A. M. Randle 2005. The myths of restoration ecology. Ecology and Society 10(1): 19. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol10/iss1/art19/ In other instances an ecosystem may be so degraded that abandonment (allowing a severely degraded ecosystem to recover on its own) may be the wisest option. Local communities sometimes object to restorations that include the introduction of large predators or plants that require disturbance regimes such as regular fires, citing threat to human habitation in the area. High economic costs can also be perceived as a negative impact of the restoration process. Public opinion is very important in the feasibility of a restoration; if the public believes that the costs of restoration outweigh the benefits they will not support it. Many failures have occurred in past restoration projects, many times because clear goals were not set out as the aim of the restoration, or an incomplete understanding of the underlying ecological framework lead to insufficient measures. This may be because, as Peter Alpert says, \\"people may not [always] know how to manage natural systems effectively\\".Alpert, P. 2002. Managing the wild: should stewards be pilots? Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 9(2): 494-499. Furthermore, many assumptions are made about myths of restoration such as carbon copy, where a restoration plan, which worked in one area, is applied to another with the same results expected, but not realized. = Science-practice gap = One of the struggles for both fields is a divide between restoration ecology and ecological restoration in practice. Many restoration practitioners as well as scientists feel that science is not being adequately incorporated into ecological restoration projects. In a 2009 survey of practitioners and scientists, the \\"science-practice gap\\" was listed as the second most commonly cited reason limiting the growth of both science and practice of restoration. There are a variety of theories about the cause of this gap. However, it has been well established that one of the main issues is that the questions studied by restoration ecologists are frequently not found useful or easily applicable by land managers. For instance, many publications in restoration ecology characterize the scope of a problem in-depth, without providing concrete solutions. Additionally many restoration ecology studies are carried out under controlled conditions and frequently at scales much smaller than actual restorations. Whether or not these patterns hold true in an applied context is often unknown. There is evidence that these small-scale experiments inflate type II error rates and differ from ecological patterns in actual restorations. One approach to addressing this gap has been the development of International Principles & Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration by the Society for Ecological restoration (see below) - however this approach is contended, with scientists active in the field suggesting that this is restrictive, and instead principles and guidelines offer flexibility Higgs, E.S., Harris, J.A., Heger, T. et al. (2018) Keep ecological restoration open and flexible. Nat Ecol Evol 2, 580. There is further complication in that restoration ecologists who want to collect large- scale data on restoration projects can face enormous hurdles in obtaining the data. Managers vary in how much data they collect, and how many records they keep. Some agencies keep only a handful of physical copies of data that make it difficult for the researcher to access. Many restoration projects are limited by time and money, so data collection and record-keeping are not always feasible. However, this limits the ability of scientists to analyze restoration projects and give recommendations based on empirical data.  Contrasting restoration ecology and conservation biology  Restoration ecology may be viewed as a sub-discipline of conservation biology, the scientific study of how to protect and restore biodiversity. Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting conservation movement. Both restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, conservation biology is primarily rooted in population biology. Because of that, it is generally organized at the population genetic level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. endangered species). Restoration ecology is organized at the community level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems. In addition, conservation biology often concentrates on vertebrate animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on plants. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have \\"poster species\\" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects. For example, the Monarch butterfly is a poster species for conserving and restoring milkweed plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on soils, soil structure, fungi, and microorganisms because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems. Natural Capital Committee's recommendation for a 25-year plan The UK Natural Capital Committee (NCC) made a recommendation in its second State of Natural Capital report published in March 2014 that in order to meet the Government's goal of being the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it was inherited, a long-term 25-year plan was needed to maintain and improve England's natural capital. The UK Government has not yet responded to this recommendation. The Secretary of State for the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson, described his ambition for the natural environment and how the work of the Committee fits into this at an NCC event in November 2012: \\"I do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. I want us to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC's innovative work is geared towards\\".  International Principles & Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration  The Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) released the second edition of the International Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration on September 27, 2019, in Cape Town, South Africa at SER's 8th World Conference on Ecological Restoration. This groundbreaking publication provides updated and expanded guidance on the practice of ecological restoration, clarifies the breadth of ecological restoration and allied environmental repair activities, and includes ideas and input from a diverse international group of restoration scientists and practitioners. The second edition builds on the first edition of the Standards, which was released December 12, 2016 at the Convention on Biological Diversity's 13th Conference of the Parties in Cancun, Mexico. The development of these Standards has been broadly consultative. The first edition was circulated to dozens of practitioners and experts for feedback and review. After release of the first edition, SER held workshops and listening sessions, sought feedback from key international partners and stakeholders, opened a survey to members, affiliates and supporters, and considered and responded to published critiques. The International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration: * Present a robust framework to guide restoration projects toward achieving intended goals * Address restoration challenges including: effective design and implementation, accounting for complex ecosystem dynamics (especially in the context of climate change), and navigating trade-offs associated with land management priorities and decisions * Highlight the role of ecological restoration in connecting social, community, productivity, and sustainability goals * Recommend performance measures for restorative activities for industries, communities, and governments to consider * Enhance the list of practices and actions that guide practitioners in planning, implementation, and monitoring activities, including: appropriate approaches to site assessment and identification of reference ecosystems, different restoration approaches including natural regeneration, and the role of ecological restoration in global restoration initiatives * Include an expanded glossary of restoration terminology * Provide a technical appendix on sourcing of seeds and other propagules for restoration.

Skeffington Hall, Leicestershire Early life William Skeffington was born in Skeffington Hall, Leicestershire, the eldest son of Thomas Skeffington by his wife, Mary. His brother John was the patriarch of the Massareene family. He succeeded his father by 1496.  Career  William was appointed High Sheriff of Leicestershire and Warwickshire for 1508, 1515 and 1521. He was knighted by King Henry VII in 1509 and appointed Master of the Ordnance from 1515 to 1534. He accompanied King Henry VIII together with other knights to the king's iconic meeting in 1520 with King Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. In 1523, he received from Henry VIII property near Tunbridge that had belonged to the executed traitor Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and in 1529 represented Leicestershire as a knight of the shire in the English House of Commons. He was appointed in 1529 Lord Deputy of Ireland to Henry's son, the duke of Richmond, the nominal Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He crossed over in August 1529, but his power was so circumscribed by instructions from Henry that the head of the Fitzgeralds, Gerald, 9th earl of Kildare, and not Skeffington, was the real governor of Ireland. In May 1531 Skeffington accepted the formal submission of the Gaelic leader Hugh Duff O'Donnell in Drogheda. This state of affairs lasted for three years and then in 1532 the deputy was recalled. In 1534, Kildare being in prison in England and his son Silken Thomas, being in revolt, Skeffington was again appointed Deputy, at approximately 70 years of age. Due to his age and ill-health he was most reluctant to resume the office. He was also on the worst possible terms with his future successor as Lord Deputy, Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane, and their quarrels are said to have shortened Skeffington's life. After some delay he landed at Dublin in October 1534 and marched at once to relieve Drogheda, but further progress in the work of crushing the rebellion was seriously delayed by his illness. However, in the spring of 1535 he was again in the field. He took Maynooth Castle, killing and executing the entire garrison. The heavy artillery used by him on this occasion earning for him his surname of \\"The Gunner\\"; he forced some of Kildare's allies to make peace and captured Dungarvan. He died at Kilmainham, Dublin on 31 December 1535, and was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. There is a monument to him in the parish church at Skeffington. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas.  Marriages Skeffington married firstly Margaret Digby, daughter of Sir Everard Digby (died 1509) of Tilton, Leicestershire, by whom he had a son and heir, Thomas Skeffington.

Studying Catholic theology in Wittenberg and in Frankfurt an der Oder and first as a Catholic priest, later a Lutheran and then a Calvinist bishop in the Principality of Transylvania, he learnt the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches, but later rejected several of them and came to embrace Unitarianism. He disputed the Christian view on the Holy Trinity, believing God to be one and indivisible. Life =Early life= Ferenc D√°vid was born in Kolozsv√°r, Hungary (present-day Cluj-Napoca, Romania), to a Transylvanian Saxon father (David Hertel, who worked as a tanner) and to a Hungarian mother. The Hertel/Herthel family was an old Transylvanian Saxon aristocratic family of Kolozsv√°r.Francisc Palt - Fr√°min-√≠√°rile soc-iale ?i religioase din Cluj in jurul anului 1570. Anuarul Inst. de Istorie Cluj, (1962), 28. In Latin and Hungarian he used his name as Francis Davidis or D√°vid Ferenc after his father's forename David. He had at least three brothers: Gregor, Peter and Nikolaus. Peter and Gregor inherited the job of their father in the guild.Elek Jakab - Kolozsv√°r t√∂rt√©nete II.(Budapest, 1888), 294 G√°sp√°r Heltai, the father of Peter's wife Borb√°la, was a Protestant Reformer, Lutheran and later Unitarian minister, translator, outstanding author of the Hungarian late Renaissance era. He owned the paper mill and the press of Kolozsv√°r where several religious and scientific books were made in Hungarian and German.1579\\\\. Diary of the judge and townsman Ferenc D√°vid was raised Catholic. After finishing his studies in the High School of Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj Napoca, Romania) he went to the Holy Roman Empire to study Catholic theology first at the University of Wittenberg and then later at the Alma Mater Viadrina (University of Frankfurt an der Oder) where he became a Catholic parson. =Lutheranism= In 1542 the Lutheran reformator, Johannes Honterus introduced the Lutheran doctrines to the citizens of Kolozsv√°r.:de:Unitarische Kirche Siebenb√ºrgen#cite ref-1 After arriving back in Transylvania Ferenc D√°vid joined the Lutheran wing of the Reformation where he became a minister and then a Lutheran bishop. He worked as headmaster of the Gymnasium of Beszterce (today Bistri»õa, Romania), then as Lutheran pastor in Petres (today Cetate, Romania), later headmaster of the Gymnasium of Kolozsv√°r and from 1555 chief pastor of Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj Napoca, Romania). On 1 June 1557 the Diet of Torda (National Assembly) stated that 'everybody should live in a belief that he or she wants if it is done without the distrust of another' which meant for the population of the Principality of Transylvania that it became allowed to practise not just the Roman Catholic, but the Lutheran religion. =Calvinism= In 1559 he entered the Reformed Church where he was elected bishop of the Hungarian churches in Transylvania and he was also the appointed court preacher to J√°nos Zsigmond Z√°polya, Prince of Transylvania. The prince allowed him to research in the royal library and to work in the royal court on his theological theses. =Unitarianism= After the Battle of Moh√°cs the political instability, the weakening of the Roman Catholic denomination (continuous expansion of the Ottoman Empire, heretic movements in Transylvania especially of Arianism, Bogumilism etc.) prepared the way for the new ideas of the Reformation.:hu:Unit√°rius vall√°s A well known Italian antitrinitarian, Giorgio Biandrata moved to Transylvania in 1563 into the royal court of John II Sigismund Z√°polya and became his own doctor. Biandrata co-operated with Ferenc D√°vid on theological works. D√°vid's discussion of the Holy Trinity began in 1565, with doubts of the personality of the Holy Spirit, because he could find no scriptural basis for the doctrine of the Trinity. One of his main points against the existence of the Holy Trinity was that what the Arians during the early ages of Christianity liked to refer to does not come up in the Bible. He was influenced by the antitrinitarian and humanist views of Michael Servetus and Giovanni Valentino Gentile. Together with Giorgio Biandrata he published polemical writings against Trinitarian belief, particularly De falsa et vera unius Dei Patris, Filii et Spiritus Sancti cognitione which is largely a summarized version of Servetus's Christianismi Restitutio. But in 1578 the collaboration broke up as Biandrata was charged with immorality. An important difference between the views of the two theologians was that Ferenc D√°vid became a nonadorant which meant that he renounced the necessity of invoking Christ in prayers. Working in the royal court, he convinced the prince about his point of view on religion, so that John II Sigismund Z√°polya accepted his theses and became the first Unitarian ruler. In 1567 John II Sigismund Z√°polya allowed him to use his press in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (today Alba Iulia, Romania) to propagate the religion. =Edict of Torda (1568)= Ferenc D√°vid holding his speech on the Diet of Torda in 1568 (today Turda, Romania) by Alad√°r K√∂r√∂sf≈ëi-Kriesch (1896) The aim of his life as Ferenc D√°vid wrote was 'the restoration of the pure Christianity of Jesus' which meant for him the search for the truth in the whole freedom of thought. So he sought to persuade the prince, John II Sigismund Z√°polya and several people in important positions to reach an agreement between the opposite sides of the religious debate. His attempts were successful. Between 6 and 13 January 1568 on the Diet of Torda the assembled representatives of the Hungarian nobility, the Szeklers, the Transylvanian Saxons and the royal court of the Principality of Transylvania proclaimed the Edict of Torda which included - as first in Europe - the practising and propagation of the recepta religios (allowed religions) which were the Roman Catholic, the Lutheran, the Calvinist and the Unitarian. This order can be seen as the first law for the 'freedom of religion'. Thanks to that beside the three lawful nations of Transylvania the four lawful allowed religions could have an ecclesiastical, political and public law system in the Constitution of the Principality of Transylvania. From that moment on the constitution based on the equal rights of the three nations and the four religions. =Prison and death= Deva, Romania In 1571, John II Sigismund Z√°polya was succeeded by Istv√°n B√°thory, a Roman Catholic, and the policy shifted toward persecution of the new religious institutions. In the same year the new ruler took the press of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r back from the Unitarians. On the Diet of 1572 in Marosv√°s√°rhely (today T√¢rgu Mure»ô, Romania) the religious laws were strengthened, but it declared the prohibition of the changing of religion. When, under the influence of Johannes Sommer, rector of the Gymnasium of Kolozsv√°r, D√°vid denied the necessity of invoking Jesus Christ in prayer (about 1572), the attempted mediation of Faustus Socinus, upon Blandrata's request, was unsuccessful. Ferenc D√°vid was sentenced to life imprisonment in D√©va, Principality of Transylvania (today Deva, Romania), and died there in 1579. The ruins of the prison site in the city now hold a memorial for him. Lukas Trauzner After the death of Ferenc David, Lukas Trauzner, his son-in-law, wrote together with Mikl√≥s Bog√°ti Fazekas, Bernard Jacobinus (father of J√°nos Jacobinus) and the sons of Ferenc D√°vid the Defensio Francisci Davidis in negotio de non invocando Jesu Christo in precibus (Basel, 1581) and were part of the inner opposition of the moderate Unitarianism movement of Demeter Hunyadi. Lukas Trauzner was sentenced to jail in 1579 because of his Sabbatarian-Unitarian beliefs.[Kanyar√≥ Ferenc - Bog√°thi zsolt√°rai az √°rul√≥k √©s √ºld√∂z≈ëk ellen. (Ker. Magvet≈ë, 1902)] But after 1582 the political pressure eased. Lukas Trauzner and Gabriel Haller went to Vienna in 1598 in legation. The imperial commissioners described Trauzner as Sabbatarian and Haller as Arianist.[Jakab E. Kolozsv√°r t√∂rt√©nete II, 302] Later he was active in the political negotiations between Transylvania and Austria.[ 1601 maius 19: ‚ÄûConsul igitur cum quibusdam aliis, inter quos erat Lucas Trausnerus, vitae suae consulere volent negato ipsis salvo conductu iter ingredicentur domum versus; remansit tunc Bornemisza Boldisar, donex impetrato pro se et omnibus mercatoribus salvo conductu et ipse cum universis mercibus prins arrestatis est liber dimissus\\". v.√∂. Quellen etc. V. 304.] In 1603 he was a dedicated follower of the prince, M√≥zes Sz√©kely. He as a Unitarian undertook in the name of the prince to get the citizens of Beszterce into submission.[ Jakab Elek - Kolozsv√°r t√∂rt√©nete, II. 384: N.

Lukas Trauzner had to go to jail for two months, but by leaving the Unitarian Church and by apostasy he could get free. He lived from then on as a Catholic and but stayed as an active member of the mostly Unitarian Transylvanian Saxon community in Kolozsv√°r until his death.[Jakab Elek, Kolozsv√°r t√∂rt√©nete. II. 388.] Beliefs = Christology = Scholars still have to address fully Ferenc D√°vid's Hungarian works for a satisfactory assessment of his beliefs.Mih√°ly Bal√°zs Early Transylvanian antitrinitarianism (1566-1571): from Servet to Palaeologus 1996 Page 27 = Invocation controversy = In his early years as a Nontrinitarian, D√°vid supported prayer to Christ, as can be seen in his answer to P√©ter Melius Juh√°sz, the Refutatio scripti Petri Melii (‚ÄòRefutation of the writings of P√©ter M√©liusz‚Äô, Alba Iulia, 1567).Andrews, James Ferenc D√°vid and the search for Bible truth in Transylvania 2010 Lulu In his later years D√°vid adopted the radical, nonadorant view of Jacob Palaeologus, that Christ should not be invoked in prayer, but that prayer should be directed only to God the Father.\\"D√°vid, however, having an inquisitive mind, was much more inclined to pioneer in fresh fields than to rest content in those already won, and he was open to the stimulating influence of able and independent scholars teaching in the school at Kolozsv√°r.... Before coming to Kolozsv√°r [Jacobus Palaeologus] had been one of the leaders in the non-adorantist movement in Poland; and according to Socinus he had been the first of all to teach in Poland ‚Äòthe very wicked and detestable view that Christ should not be adored or invoked.‚Äô It will be remembered that just before this time this question had been very hotly discussed among the Polish Brethren, and that the majority in Little Poland, following the leadership of Paulus and Czechowicz, had adopted the conservative view, rejecting that of Budny and Palaeologus. Knowledge of this controversy will of course have reached Biandrata, who kept in touch with the brethren in Poland; while at Kolozsv√°r Palaeologus no doubt found a sympathetic ear in D√°vid as he laid before him the view that he had unsuccessfully advocated in Poland.\\" E. M. Wilbur, A History of Unitarianism (Cambridge, 1952), p. 64. According to Ferenc David, Jesus is understood as a human being. = Virgin birth = After leaving Calvinism, D√°vid adopted the view of Laelio Sozzini that the existence of Christ began when he was conceived by the Virgin Mary through the operation of the Holy Spirit. By 1578, it would appear that D√°vid had come to adopt the view that Jesus was the literal son of Joseph.This can be seen in his exchange of letters with Fausto Sozzini (De invocatio Disputatio [1578-79]). \\"They agreed that Jesus as fully human was also mortal. Socinus, however, believed in the conception of Christ through the Holy Spirit and in the virgin birth of Jesus the Saviour. It is quite likely that D√°vid, as in Thesis I prepared by Biandrata, had come to hold that Jesus was the son of Joseph and thereby the descendant of King David\\" (George H. Williams, \\"The Christological Issues between Francis David and Faustus Socinus during the Disputation on the Invocation of Christ, 1578-1579,\\" in Antitrinitarianism in the Second Half of the 16th Century [Budapest: Akademiai Kiado, 1982], p. 298). \\"In Transylvania Bishop Francis David repudiated the doctrine of the virgin birth and refused to worship Christ\\" (Chambers's Encyclopaedia [1968 revision p. 103]). However some historians dispute this and argue that he believed in the virgin birth until the day of his deathBibliotheca dissidentium 26. Hungarian Antitrinitarians 4.

Personal life He married twice. The name of his first wife is unknown, she died in 1570 in Kolozsv√°r. His second wife was Kata Bar√°t, the daughter of Istv√°n Bar√°t (Stephan M√ºnich), melodist and the chief judge of Kolozsv√°r.[Hans Petri, Johannes Sommer, ein s√°chsischer Humanist und Teologe des 16 Jahrhunderts, Siebenb√ºrgische Vierteljahrschrift, 58, 1935. 300‚Äî301. 1574: Moritur Caspar Heltai hoc ipso anno et Ioannes Somme r Pirnensis. v.√∂, Gyulafi Lest√°r feljegyz√©sei, Magya r T√∂rt.

Influence =Influence in Hungary and Transylvania= After his death D√°vid came to be counted as, and honoured as, the first in the line of Hungarian Unitarian bishops based in Kolozsv√°r (Cluj). His writings continued to be published, and other recollections written down and collected, up to the time of Mih√°ly Lombard de Szent√°brah√°m. =Influence of Ferenc D√°vid in England and America= English- speaking Unitarianism was largely unaware of D√°vid. Most of the Unitarian writings which came via Amsterdam to England were of authors of the Polish Brethren, not Hungarians, as in the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant (or \\"Library of the Polish Brethren called Unitarians\\") of which Locke, Voltaire and Newton owned copies. The works of D√°vid and Gy√∂rgy Enyedi's were not reprinted in the 17th century. It was the visit of S√°ndor B√∂l√∂ni Farkas to Britain and America 1830-1832, which made English speaking Unitarians aware of the continued existence of Hungarian Unitarians - and following that, of the legacy of Ferenc D√°vid. The Unitarian Universalist author John A. Buehrens (1989)Buehrens Our chosen faith: an introduction to Unitarian Universalism attributes to Ferenc D√°vid the statement, \\"We need not think alike to love alike\\". The phrase is cited also in Our Historic Faith by Mark W. HarrisUnitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith by Mark W. Harris and in the 1993 Unitarian Universalist Hymnal Singing the Living Tradition in reading #566, which is a compilation of quotes by David, compiled by Rev. Richard Fewekes,Singing the Living Tradition. . but the source for this is not given in either case. The phrase is given in no source prior to Buehren's book. In an article published by UU World, \\"Who Really Said That?\\" Peter Hughes claims that there is no evidence that D√°vid actually said this. He attributes the quote to Methodist founder John Wesley, who asked in a sermon on ‚ÄúCatholic Spirit,‚Äù ‚ÄúThough we cannot think alike, may we not love alike?‚Äù Works Works of D√°vid, and of the Unitarian Church. * 1550 Elegia, Scripta ad Eximium D.

Guthrie has been criticized by the national media and the SPLC for being a former member of the League of the South and for having promoted the school at a convention of the Council of Conservative Citizens. It was once planned to be built in Shelbyville, Tennessee, but the proponents were not able to raise sufficient funds to purchase the property. Subsequently, the group sought to purchase another site in Middle Tennessee, the old Franklin County High School (FCHS) in Winchester, Tennessee, but that effort was ended July 2006. Earlier attempts at purchasing the former campus of Ambassador College in Big Sandy, Texas and Morristown College in Morristown, Tennessee were also unsuccessful.

It is the sequel to the 1993 Sega Genesis game Gunstar Heroes, with the story taking place after the events of the original game and featuring an expanded combat system over its predecessor. Story Taking place after the destruction of the \\"God of Ruin\\" (also known as Golden Silver, the final boss) at the end of Gunstar Heroes, the explosion created four moons orbiting the Earth. However, many years later, the creation of a fifth moon reveals a plan to resurrect the malevolent Empire and Golden Silver once again.

Super Heroes has different storylines based on what difficulty is chosen and which character the player is playing as.

The controls for Red and Blue no longer distinguish by the Free and Fixed Shot and both have more advanced, equal and versatile controls. The Throw from the original is taken out, and various melee attacks are now performed by using the A and B buttons in combination with the D-pad. The ability to combine different weapons is absent - instead, the player has the option to select from three weapon types at any time in the game. The game also uses a supercharge meter that fills as the player defeats enemies; using this energy allows the player to fire a powerful attack. Reception The game was almost universally praised by critics as a compelling action game and received high scores, even receiving several \\"Best GBA Game Of E3 2005\\" awards. However, the game still did not sell very well, and Nintendo Power has urged gamers on numerous times to get the game, disappointed that it did not appear in the top selling GBA games list.

The population is 493 (Canada Census, 2016). It is the home of the Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, a Northern Tutchone-speaking people. Mining The area around Carmacks has abundant mineral resources, including coal, copper, and gold. Various mining activities are taking place on mineral sites around Carmacks. There is a small zinc-copper mine in production near Carmacks operated by Western Silver and a gold property northwest of Carmacks currently in the exploration stage operated by Northern Freegold Resources based out of Whitehorse. Geography The Yukon River bridge at Carmacks Carmacks is situated at the confluence of the Nordenskiold and Yukon rivers, approximately north of Whitehorse and south of Dawson City on the North Klondike Highway. It is the site of one of the four bridges over the Yukon River. The Campbell Highway also intersects the community and carries on to Faro, Ross River and Watson Lake, providing a gateway to the Canol Road and some of Yukon's most spectacular scenery. History The name of the settlement comes from George Carmack who, in 1891, found coal nearby. He created a trading post and began by engaging in commerce with local people, before opening a coal mine in the south bank of the Yukon River. The focus of his entrepreneurial energy switched a few years later when he or his wife, Kate Carmack, discovered gold, at what was to become the Discovery Claim, near Dawson City. Administration Carmacks is the only place in Yukon to be considered a designated place. History The community consists of the Village of Carmacks and the Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation and was named after George Washington Carmack, who found coal near Tantalus Butte (locally called Coal Mine Hill) in 1893. Carmack built a trading post and traded with locals near the present site of Carmacks and also started a coal mine on the south bank of the Yukon River. Carmack soon discovered gold in the Dawson region with his wife, Kate Carmack, her brother, Keish (Skookum Jim), and Dawson Charlie (Tagish Charlie) a few years later, starting the Klondike Gold Rush. Carmacks became incorporated as a village on November 1, 1984. Transportation Carmacks is served by Klondike Highway by cars and Carmacks Airport by air. Recreation The Carmacks Recreation Centre is at the east end of River Drive between the nursing station and visitor centre, and is a community focal point for youth. There is a youth drop in daily with a computer access, video games, table games and other activities, often funded by Yukon grant programs. The gymnasium is host to adult floor hockey and other sports. The Recreation Centre also holds a three lane curling rink, fully loaded fitness gym and a full kitchen for all occasions. Carmacks also has an indoor swimming pool that is open to the community from June to September. Sports Every February, Carmacks hosts a checkpoint for both the long- distance Yukon Quest sled dog race and the Yukon Arctic Ultra foot/ski/bike race. Demographics Carmacks is the only community in Yukon which has the status of designated place in Canadian censuses. Carmacks has a 91.4% First Nations population the majority of which belong to the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nations. The local language of the LSCFN community is Northern Tuchone, which is carried on both by the elders and taught to all students at the local Tantalus Elementary/high School. Climate Carmacks has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with short but mild summers and long, severely cold winters.

Throughout his career, Beaudoin met and corresponded with a wide range of better-known poets, such as William Carlos Williams, E. E. Cummings, Randall Jarrell, and Ezra Pound. Beaudoin also had an important influence as leader of the Memphis literary community, presiding over a literary circle described by Memphis author James Conaway in his memoir Memphis Afternoons. During the Depression era, Beaudoin lived in New Orleans, and he later ran an art gallery for several years in Greenwich Village, New York. Beaudoin pioneered the \\"eye poem\\" in the 1940s, and one newspaper account of his career states that Beaudoin produced thousands of eye poems over a ten-year period. A folio edition of 6,000 poems was published by Archangel Press in 1947. His work appeared in over 100 publications. Beaudoin also founded the Poetry Society of Tennessee. Beaudoin served as a kind of father figure to many Memphis writers, and his house on the Mississippi river was the site of his literary salon. Memphis poet and artist Frances Cowden, a member of Beaudoin's circle, later recalled that Inisfree, as he called his home on the river, was a place where local poets would gather to talk about, and read, poetry with Beaudoin: \\"We would all go down there and read poetry and listen to him talk about poetry. And if you had a big decision you needed to make in your life, you would go and talk to Kenneth about it first because he always gave good advice.\\" Beaudoin was named \\"Poet Laureate of the River\\" in 1976 at the Mid-South Festival. Beaudoin was also known for the \\"gemstone awards\\" he would give to poets. Starting in the 1950s, Beaudoin supported himself as chief clerk in criminal intelligence with the Memphis Police Department. Beaudoin considered the job a source of rich insight into human nature. In a 1981 newspaper interview Beaudoin explained, \\"My police job kept me close to human beings in tense situations.... From a poet's point of view, it was perhaps the most important job I could have had. When you associate with people on a day-to-day basis, there's nothing exciting about it. You don't even remember it. But when people are under pressure, you can talk to them differently and the experience becomes memorable. Where else could you learn as much about people as at a police station?\\" Beaudoin retired from his police job in 1980, due to blindness. Beaudoin was a charter member and officer of the Memphis Archaeological and Geological Society that was formed in 1951. The Society performed and reported on the first house excavation at Chucalissa Indian Village. The Society was heavily involved with early archaeological and geological surveys and excavations in eastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, northeastern Alabama and western Tennessee. Beaudoin's papers are housed at the University of Memphis Special Collections Department.

It originated in Yorkshire at least as early as the 19th century. History Fat rascals were known in the Yorkshire region in the nineteenth century as a form of tea cake containing butter and cream. An 1859 Charles Dickens story identifies the fat rascal with the singing hinny of Northumberland. A fat rascal could also be baked as a turf cake, a buttery, flat cake baked in a covered pan among the ashes of a peat fire, and the terms fat rascal and turf cake are sometimes used interchangeably. A Yorkshire cookery book of 1973 had plain flour, baking powder, butter and currants as the ingredients.The Yorkshire Kitchen. Harrogate: St John Ambulance, 1973; p. 107 A 1980 Yorkshire cookbook described fat rascals as a means of using leftover pastry, typically consisting of scraps of shortcrust pastry, sugared, sprinkled with currants and rolled into thick flat cakes before baking. Fat rascals, whatever their composition, do not appear to have been widely known outside the Yorkshire region until the 1980s, although there are occasional mentions in other regions, such as in Rye, Sussex in Ford Madox Ford's 1931 memoirs. There is a recipe for fat rascals in a book called \\"The Presidents' Cook Book\\" by Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks published in 1968 by Funk and Wagnalls in the USA. They say \\"In Edith Roosevelt's most cherished cook book .... is this recipe for hot biscuits.\\" This cook book now rests on a shelf in the parlour of Sagamore Hill. Bettys A widely recognised version of the fat rascal was introduced by Bettys Caf√© Tea Rooms in North Yorkshire in 1983. This is a plump, fruity scone with a 'face' made from cherries and almonds based on a rock cake recipe, developed by Helen Frankel, then a buyer and marketing assistant at Bettys. Following its launch, the fat rascal quickly became Bettys‚Äô best known and best-selling bakery product, selling over 375,000 per year.

The strip has appeared at 1UP.com until September 30, 2009 when the blog ended and Norm promised to continue the comic at spookingtons.com. Full-length comic books of Hsu and Chan have also been published by Slave Labor Graphics, as well as a trade paperback collecting the first five issues of the comic. Norm began publishing a spin-off comic of Hsu and Chan, titled Game Critter Super-Squad!, in 2003. Following the adventures of 11-year-old Jimmy \\"Milhouse\\" Patton, Game Critter Super-Squad! ran for a year in GameNOW. More recently, animated shorts of the characters were produced and are available at the Spookingtons website. Additional comics and videos were produced in 2017 through Patreon funding. Background Hsu and Chan follows the misadventures of the brothers Hsu and Chan Tanaka, who own and operate a company called \\"Tanaka Bros. Game Development\\" that specializes in knock-offs of popular titles. For example Bad Milage 2000, a knock-off of Gran Turismo appears in the strip \\"Hsu and Chan in: Chan Turismo!\\" Tanaka Bros. Game Development has other, less seen employees, including Arnie, a ground squirrel bearing a striking resemblance to Sonic the Hedgehog, Gila Mobster, a brutish Charmander parody who can be seen wearing a black fedora with a lighter grasped in the end of his tail, and Chernobyl, the radioactive chipmunk who is a take on Pikachu. The name Dirk appears frequently as a replacement for a random name (\\"Ledger of Zelda\\") or for anagrams and codenames (\\"Pocket Morons: Platinum\\"; \\"Sonic Boobs\\"). Many comics also make references to Cheez-its, usually with characters noticing crumbs (This was also done in \\"The Otters: The Survivors\\"). Many references are made to the Tomb Raider series, usually referring to the newer games as crimes against humanity. The first comic to spin off from Hsu and Chan was Game Critter Super-Squad!, which ran in EGM's now-defunct sister magazine, GameNOW. This strip follows the midadventures of 11-year-old Jimmy \\"Milhouse\\" Patton (a human) and the Game Critter Super-Squad, a team consisting of Arnie, Sonic the Hedgehog, Gila Mobster, and X, an anthropomorphic, green letter X who works for Microsoft.  Slave Labor comics  After three years with EGM, Norm contacted Slave Labor Graphics about making a standalone, full-length Hsu and Chan comic book. Slave Labor agreed, with eight issues of the comic published between 2003 and 2009. A collection of the first five of these along with extra bonus material was released in 2004 and titled Hsu and Chan: Too Much Adventure.Scott, Norm. (2004). Hsu and Chan: Too Much Adventure. SLG Publishing. Since the EGM strips are typically one page long, they are self- contained stories that parody a specific video game, usually the title on that month's cover of EGM. The Slave Labor comics, on the other hand, are considerably longer and more reliant on plot. The Slave Labor comics are also less video game-centric and feature Hsu and Chan battling supernatural foes and their arch-rivals at the competing video game company, Yamamoto Games, Inc. Norm's naturally wordy dialogue is slightly toned down for the EGM strip, a necessary compromise given the single page nature of the strip. In the Slave Labor comic, the characters are more verbose. Despite the separate focuses of the two different strips, they exist within the same universe. In the Slave Labor comics Hsu's right hand is severed and replaced with a prosthetic appliance; the change was reflected in the EGM strip.

In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Zuloaga served as unconstitutional interim conservative president of Mexico in opposition to the constitutional president Benito Ju√°rez of the Liberal Party. Biography =Early years= Zuloaga was born in √Ålamos, Sonora. He attended primary school in Chihuahua before entering a seminary in Mexico City, which he left. He returned to Chihuahua, enlisting in the civil militia in 1834. He participated in campaigns against the Apaches and Comanches. He returned to the capital in 1838 and entered the army as a second lieutenant of engineers. He took part in the Pastry War against the French (1838) and the War of Texas Independence. Initially a liberal in politics, in 1840 he defended the government of President Anastasio Bustamante (who had both liberal and conservative connections). The following year he was allied with Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. He fought the separatists in Yucat√°n and directed the fortifications at Monterrey. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he was mayor of Chihuahua. He rejoined the army and in 1838 was named the president of the Council of War of the garrison of Mexico City. In 1854, he fought against the liberals supporting the Plan de Ayutla and was taken prisoner. He was now a brigadier. In 1855, he was a representative of Chihuahua in the Junta of Representatives of the States that met in Cuernavaca. =Conservative president of Mexico= Zuloaga fought against the conservatives in two campaigns in Puebla, but on 17 December 1857 he came out against the 1857 Constitution of Mexico and joined in a coup d'√©tat staged by a junta of generals and leading Catholic clergy. Two days later, the wavering moderate President Ignacio Comonfort accepted the reactionary Plan of Tacubaya, thus abandoning the Constitution of 1857. Various liberals protested, including Benito Ju√°rez, the president of the Supreme Court and constitutional vice-president, next in line to succeed to the presidency, but they were arrested and imprisoned. The leaders of the junta became uneasy after President Comonfort announced he was assuming extraordinary powers for himself. On 11 January 1858, General Zuloaga demanded the president's resignation (although Comonfort and Zuloaga had been friends). Comonfort resisted for ten days. During that time he freed Ju√°rez and the other liberals who had been jailed. Upon Comonfort's ouster, Ju√°rez assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution, but Zuloaga was in military command of the capital, and Ju√°rez had to establish his government in Guanajuato. This was the beginning of the War of the Reform. Comonfort left the country, repudiated by all parties. Zuloaga was selected by the backers of the anti-constitutional junta, conservative generals and Catholic clergy, to serve as interim president of Mexico on (21 January 1858). He held this position until 24 December 1858, when he was deposed by General Manuel Robles Pezuela (as a substitute for General Miguel Miram√≥n, who was on campaign), under the Plan de Navidad. Robles Pezuela held the presidency until 21 January 1859, and, on 24 January, Zuloaga returned to office. (Jos√© Mariano Salas also claimed the conservative presidency briefly.) Zuloaga's second term lasted until 1 February 1859, when he was replaced by Miram√≥n. On 9 May 1860, Zuloaga issued a proclamation reclaiming the presidency, but the following day Miram√≥n had him arrested. Miram√≥n was reported to have told Zuloaga upon his arrest, \\"I will teach you how to win the presidency.\\" Zuloaga escaped from Le√≥n, Guanajuato, on 3 August 1860 and marched to Mexico City. However, the Governing Council (conservative junta) there refused to recognize him as president. He was president again for two years (from 28 December 1860 to 28 December 1862), but in name only, because he spent this time on the campaign. =Later life= Upon the triumph of the liberals in the War of the Reform, Zuloaga was declared an outlaw because of his responsibility for the execution of Melchor Ocampo. Zuloaga tried to ally himself with the French during the period of the Second Empire (1864-1867), but without success as the later defeat of the French contributed to the end of conservative resistance on the battlefield in Mexico. In 1865, he was exiled to Cuba. He returned to Mexico years later, after the death of Ju√°rez. He did not re-enter politics but became a tobacco merchant. He died in Mexico City in 1898.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1999, and was watched in around 8.1 million homes during the broadcast. In the episode, the Simpsons are given free tickets to a preview screening of Mel Gibson's new film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Gibson laments his current non-violent role and wants someone to give him criticism. When Homer sees Gibson talking with Marge, he gives him a brutal review, leading Gibson to believe that Homer is the only man brave enough to give suggestions. As a result, he hires him to create a better ending. However, when the ending proves to be too controversial, Gibson and Homer end up on the run from studio executives with the film. The episode was written by then-showrunner Mike Scully and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The story was a parody of the film industry and its practice with test screenings and overly violent films. It featured several references to various films as well as other popular culture. Gibson guest starred as himself, and Jack Burns voiced a film studio executive named Edward Christian. Since airing, the episode has received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Gibson was praised for his performance. It was released on the DVD collection The Simpsons Film Festival in 2002, and The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season in 2008. Plot Homer test drives - and destroys - a new electric car so that he can get a free gift, which turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill, so that the filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful, but while reading the comment cards after the movie, he is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, partially inspired by him seeing Gibson flirting with Marge, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth. Gibson shows up at the Simpsons' door and invites Homer and his family to come with him to Hollywood to change the film. Homer and Gibson work together while the rest of the family explores Hollywood, but when Homer's ideas prove to be stupid and pointless, Gibson begins to wonder whether he made a mistake. However, he is enthusiastic when Homer tells him his ideas for the famous \\"filibuster\\" scene at the end. The next day, they present the new ending to the producers, in which Mr. Smith goes berserk and slaughters every member of the United States Congress and the President in a mindless action movie sequence. The producers are horrified at this, saying that the film was meant to be the studio's prestige picture. They attempt to burn the new ending, but Homer and Gibson, determined to save their film, run away with it. They meet up with the rest of the family at a car museum, where they steal a replica of the main villain's car from The Road Warrior and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film executives on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their car out of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, who does not blame him, arriving to the conclusion there is no place for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks him out of his limousine. Production and themes Mike Scully wrote the episode as well as being showrunner for the eleventh season of The Simpsons \\"Beyond Blunderdome\\" was written by then-showrunner Mike Scully and directed by Steven Dean Moore, airing as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999‚Äì2000). It was Scully's first writing credit since he took over as showrunner for the show. In comparison with other episode scripts, the staff writers did not change much of the original writing. The plot revolves around Mel Gibson doing a remake of the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analysed the episode and wrote in the book The Simpsons in the Classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield that \\"the episode is able to critique the practice of test screening, violence in film, and one of movies' favorite standards ‚Äì the car chase\\", calling it \\"a ridiculous parody of an action-film violence orgy\\". Staff writer Tom Gammill came up with the idea for the violent version of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Gibson throwing his Senator badge away at the end of the film, is a reference to the ending of the film Dirty Harry from 1971. The idea for the set piece with electric cars at the beginning of the episode came from Kevin Nealon, who was a friend of former showrunner David Mirkin. One day, he came by and demonstrated his electric car for the writing staff. Mel Gibson appeared as himself in the episode The episode featured Mel Gibson as a guest voice. Scully had previously met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser along with his wife Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes ‚Äì mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like it would not be a classy thing to do for a movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans. Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, \\"I'm getting too old for this crap,\\" a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms \\"Huh?\\" and \\"You know what I mean?\\" is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, but his voice was imitated by Dan Castellaneta. Cultural References In the episode, there are many references to popular culture. The character Rainier Wolfcastle is seen filming Saving Irene Ryan, which is a reference to the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan and actress Irene Ryan from the sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies. Homer says, \\"You had me at 'hello',\\" a quote from the film Jerry Maguire (1996), when Gibson asks for his help on his film. The airport is called \\"George Kennedy Airport\\", which is a reference to actor George Kennedy, and his role in the film Airport (1970) and its three sequels; Airport 1975 (1974), Airport '77 (1977), and The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979). When Homer and Gibson are being hunted by the executives they enter a car museum. The museum features the Batmobile from the television series Batman, General Lee from the series The Dukes of Hazzard, Herbie the Love Bug from the 1968 film The Love Bug and later films, the Monkeemobile from the series The Monkees, the Munster Koach from the series The Munsters, and the car from the series The Flintstones. Release and reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1999, as the premiere of the eleventh season of The Simpsons. In its original broadcast, \\"Beyond Blunderdome\\" finished 48th in the ratings for the week of September 20‚Äì26, 1999, with a Nielsen rating of 8.0‚Äîequivalent to approximately 8.1 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating shows such as Futurama and King of the Hill. In comparison, the previous season premiere episode, \\"Lard of the Dance\\", drew a Nielsen rating of 7.2 points with 7.1 million households watching. The episode had a lower rating than the overall rating for the entire eleventh season, which averaged 8.2 million households. On March 12, 2002, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Film Festival, along with the season four episode \\"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\\", the season seven episode \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\", and the season six episode \\"A Star is Burns\\". On October 7, 2008, \\"Beyond Blunderdome\\" was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ron Hauge, Matt Selman, and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. The episode had an alternate ending in which Apu suggests that they sell the failed film to India, since the people of India love violent, action-packed American films. This ending was included on the eleventh season DVD set. Since airing, the episode has received generally mixed reception from critics. The day after the premiere, Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune wrote that while it was \\"not the laugh riot The Simpsons have spoiled us to expect ‚Äì our appetite for showbiz parodies is waning ‚Äì the episode did have its moments.\\" He further added that he especially liked \\"the sign posted outside the movie studio gate: 'No Artistic Integrity Beyond This Point.'\\" While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing that \\"Gibson actually does a good job here, and it‚Äôs amusing to see Homer‚Äôs terrible movie ideas. This isn‚Äôt classic Simpsons, but it starts the season on a pretty good note.\\" However, an article in Salon magazine from 2000 points to \\"Beyond Blunderdome\\" as the greatest precursor to that Homer would be more predominant as ‚ÄúJerkass Homer‚Äù in the Scully era as showrunner, a Homer who \\"is not only dumb, but [has also become] disgusting and semi- sociopathic. This is the Homer who, in the season opener ['Beyond Blunderdome'], showed Marge's wedding ring to Mel Gibson and stated, 'This is a symbol that as per our marriage, she's my property and I own her.'\\" Gibson's performance has generally been praised. Simon Crerar of The Times listed his performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. Similarly, Total Film's Nathan Ditum ranked Gibson's performance as the seventh best guest appearance in the show's history in a list of twenty people, calling it \\"Another ace self-effacing appearance from a Hollywood high-flyer\\".

The remaining species, G. lasianthus (Loblolly-bay), is native to southeast North America, from Virginia south to Florida and west to Louisiana; G. fruticosa is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, from Costa Rica to Brazil. They are evergreen trees, growing to 10‚Äì20 m tall. The bark is thick and deeply fissured. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, serrated, thick, leathery, glossy, and 6‚Äì18 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 4‚Äì15 cm diameter, with 5 (occasionally 6-8) white petals; flowering is in late winter or early spring. The fruit is a dry five-valved capsule, with 1-4 seeds in each section. The species are adapted to acidic soils, and do not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils.

A modern fishfinder displays measurements of reflected sound on a graphical display, allowing an operator to interpret information to locate schools of fish, underwater debris, and the bottom of body of water. Fishfinder instruments are used both by sport and commercial fishermen. Modern electronics allows a high degree of integration between the fishfinder system, marine radar, compass and GPS navigation systems. Fathometer Fish finders were derived from fathometers, active sonar instruments used for navigation and safety to determine the depth of water. The fathom is a unit of water depth, from which the instrument gets its name. The fathometer is an echo sounding system for measurement of water depth. A fathometer will display water depth and can make an automatic permanent record of measurements. Since both fathometers and fishfinders work the same way, and use similar frequencies and can detect both the bottom and fish, the instruments have merged.  Operating theory  In operation, an electrical impulse from a transmitter is converted into a sound wave by an underwater transducer, called a hydrophone, and sent into the water. When the wave strikes something such as a fish, it is reflected back and displays size, composition, and shape of the object. The exact extent of what can be discerned depends on the frequency and power of the pulse transmitted. Knowing the speed of the wave in the water, the distance to the object that reflected the wave can be determined. The speed of sound through the water column depends on the temperature, salinity and pressure (depth). This is approximately c = 1404.85 + 4.618T - 0.0523T2 \\\\+ 1.25S + 0.017D (where c = sound speed (m/s), T = temperature (degrees Celsius), S = salinity (per mille) and D = depth). Typical values used by commercial fish finders are 4921 ft/s (1500 m/s) in seawater and 4800 ft/s (1463 m/s) in freshwater. The process can be repeated up to 40 times per second and eventually results in the bottom of the ocean being displayed versus time (the fathometer function that eventually spawned the sporting use of fishfinding. The temperature and pressure sensitivity capability of fish finder units allow one to identify the exact location of the fish in the water by the use of a temperature gauge. Functionality present in many modern fish finders also have track back capabilities in order to check the changes in movement in order to switch position and location whilst fishing. It is easy to get more detail at screen when the frequency of fish finder is high. Deep-sea trawlers and commercial fishermen normally use low-frequency which is in between 50-200 kHz where modern fish finders have multiple frequencies to view split screen results.  General interpretation  Display of a consumer type fishfinder Sonar image of a white bass feeding frenzy The image above, at right, clearly shows the bottom structure‚Äîplants, sediments and hard bottom are discernible on sonar plots of sufficiently high power and appropriate frequency. Slightly more than halfway up from the bottom to the left of the screen centre and about a third away from the left side, this image is also displaying a fish ‚Äì a light spot just to the right of a 'glare' splash from the camera's flashbulb. The X-axis of the image represents time, oldest (and behind the soundhead) to the left, most recent bottom (and current location) on the right; thus the fish is now well behind the transducer, and the vessel is now passing over a dip in the ocean floor or has just left it behind. The resulting distortion depends on both the speed of the vessel and how often the image is updated by the echo sounder.  Fish arches  With the Fish Symbol feature disabled, an angler can learn to distinguish between fish, vegetation, schools of baitfish or forage fish, debris, etc. Fish will usually appear on the screen as an arch. This is because the distance between the fish and the transducer changes as the boat passes over the fish (or the fish swims under the boat). When the fish enters the leading edge of the sonar beam, a display pixel is turned on. As the fish swims toward the centre of the beam, the distance to the fish decreases, turning on pixels at shallower depths. When the fish swims directly under the transducer, it is closer to the boat so the stronger signal shows a thicker line. As the fish swims away from the transducer, the distance increases, which shows as progressively deeper pixels. The image to the right shows a school of white bass aggressively feeding on a school of threadfin shad. Note the school of baitfish near the bottom. When threatened, baitfish form a tightly packed school, as the individuals seek safety in the center of the school. This typically looks like an irregularly shaped ball or thumbprint on the fishfinder screen. When no predators are nearby, a school of baitfish frequently appears as a thin horizontal line across the screen, at the depth where the temperature and oxygen levels are optimal. The nearly-vertical lines near the right edge of the screen show the path of fishing lures falling to the bottom.  General history in sporting and fishing  Early sporting fathometers for recreational boating used a rotating light at the edge of a circle which flashed in sync with the received echo, which in turn corresponded to depth. These also gave a small flickering flash for echos off of fish. Like today's low-end digital fathometers, they kept no record of the depth over time and provided no information about bottom structure. They had poor accuracy, especially in rough water, and were hard to read in bright light. Despite the limitations, they were still usable for rough estimates of depth, such as for verifying that the boat had not drifted into an unsafe area. Eventually, CRTs were married with a fathometer for commercial fishing and the fishfinder was born. With the advent of large LCD arrays, the high power requirements of a CRT gave way to the LCD in the early 1990s and fishfinding fathometers reached the sporting markets. Nowadays, many fishfinders available for hobby fishers have color LCD screens, built-in GPS, charting capabilities, and come bundled with transducers. Today, sporting fishfinders lack only the permanent record of the big ship navigational fathometer, and that is available in high end units that can use the ubiquitous computer to store that record as well. Recent models of fishfinders may include technology which allows for better imaging of underwater objects in an almost picture like format. Additionally options are available which produce views to the sides of the boat as well as downward which provide benefits when attempting to locate underwater structure such as reefs to fish.  Commercial and naval units  Commercial and naval fathometers of yesteryear used a strip chart recorder where an advancing roll of paper was marked by a stylus to make a permanent copy of the depth, usually with some means of also recording time (Each mark or time 'tic' is proportional to distance traveled) so that the strip charts could be readily compared to navigation charts and maneuvering logs (speed changes). Much of the world's ocean depths have been mapped using such recording strips. Fathometers of this type usually offered multiple (chart advance) speed settings, and sometimes, multiple frequencies as well. (Deep Ocean‚ÄîLow Frequency carries better, Shallows‚Äîhigh frequency shows smaller structures (like fish, submerged reefs, wrecks, or other bottom composition features of interest.) At high frequency settings, high chart speeds, such fathometers give a picture of the bottom and any intervening large or schooling fish that can be related to position. Fathometers of the constant recording type are still mandated for all large vessels (100+ tons displacement) in restricted waters (i.e. generally, within of land).

He fought along with heroes of the insurgency, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos and Vicente Guerrero in the War of Independence, and went on to fight in all the major wars of his day, from the \\"Pastry War\\", to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and the War of the Reform to the war against the French Intervention. A liberal reformer, a republican and a federalist, he was the leader of a revolution in support of the Plan de Ayutla in 1854, which led to the deposition of Santa Anna from power and the beginning of the political era in Mexico's history known as the Liberal Reform. According to historian Peter Guardino: \\"√Ålvarez was most important as a champion of the incorporation of Mexico's peasant masses into the polity of [Mexico] ... advocating universal male suffrage and municipal autonomy.\\"Peter Guardino, \\"Juan √Ålvarez\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 73. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Early life Juan √Ålvarez was born on 27 January 1790 at Santa Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n de Atoyac, now Atoyac de √Ålvarez, Guerrero. He was of peninsular Spanish and Afro-Mexican heritage. His father was an immigrant from Galicia in northwest Spain,Spanish  Letras Libres  Los Caciques: Ayer, Hoy y Ma√±ana where the pilgrimage site of Santiago de Compostela is located. His mother was Rafaela Hurtado, a parda (person of African descent), from Mexico's Pacific Ocean port of Acapulco.Vincent, Theodore G. The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero: Mexico's First Black Indian President. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 2001, p. 215. Because of his Spanish roots, √Ålvarez would be known as \\"The Galician\\" during the Mexican Independence war. He studied in primary school in Mexico City, but returned to his native town at age 17 to receive his inheritance. He worked as a cowboy and in the fields. His father died in 1807 when √Ålvarez was seventeen. Further complicating his life was that his father's land was tied up in a dispute over debts with a Spanish official. At the outbreak of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810, troops of insurgent priest Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos came through √Ålvarez's remote village of Atoyac, and he joined the insurgency.Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, pp. 214-15 Career =Insurgency and the Plan of Iguala= In November 1810, at the age of 20, Alvarez joined the fight for Mexican independence as a private under the command of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n. He fought in the battles of Aguacatillo, Tres Palos, Arroyo del Moledor, Tonaltepec and La Sabana, soon rising to the rank of captain. Before the year was out, he was wounded by a ball that pierced both legs, and he was given the command of the Guadalupe Regiment. In the assault on Tixtla on 15 May 1811, he was wounded again. He was now a colonel. After the royalist defeat of the insurgents in central Mexico, guerrilla forces continued to fight against Spanish rule. Morelos was captured and executed in 1815, and √Ålvarez joined the forces of Afro-Mexican commander Vicente Guerrero. Royalist officer Agust√≠n de Iturbide was called back into military service after a forced retirement for mishandling of funds. Iturbide suffered a series of defeats by insurgent forces, including those under Generala Antonia Nava de Catal√°n, one of the few women insurgent leaders. By 1820 when Spanish liberals seized control of the Spanish government, Iturbide was in contact with royalist high clergy, who began to speak of independence as a way to maintain their power, since Spanish liberals sought to curtail Church power. With the insurgency at a stalemate, the search was on to find a way out. Iturbide and Guerrero came into contact, with the two exchanging a series of letters to find a way forward. Iturbide began drafting a political plan, which initially did not include language guaranteeing equality of Afro-Mexicans in the post independence period. Guerrero strongly argued that they be included. A clause was part of the final draft of the Plan of Iguala read \\"All inhabitants of New Spain, without distinction to their being Europeans, Africans, or Indians, are citizens of this Monarchy with the option to seek all employment according to their merits and virtues.\\" Guerrero approved of the final draft and the alliance between the old insurgent and the royalist-turned-insurgent created political moment to achieve independence. However, there were members of the old insurgency, including Alvarez as well as Isidoro Montesdeoca, Pedro Asencio, and Gordiano Guzm√°n who objected to the Plan on a variety of grounds. These rejectionists continued to fight the royalists and agreed not to fight against Iturbide.Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, pp. 121-130. Under Iturbide's revised Plan de Iguala, which insurgent guerrilla leader Vicente Guerrero had shaped to include demands of the Afro-Mexican insurgents, allied forces and formed the Army of the Three Guarantees. √Ålvarez was entrusted with taking key target of Acapulco from the royalists, which he did on 15 October 1821. He was named commander of Acapulco. From that point, he was one of the leaders of the insurgents and chief in the southern region. Alvarez deeply distrusted Iturbide and the American-born Spaniards who suddenly signed on to the struggle for independence. In a speech to his Afro-Mexican troops, Alvarez disparaged the character and motives of the creole elite. \\"We stand today as mortal enemies of all Creolismo ... They have long tried to cover us with shame, to herd us as if we were four-legged beasts ... to speak of us as if we were stupid animals, ... and now they solicit our extermination ... We say to the Creoles that we want our freedom.\\"quoted by Vincent, The Legacy of Vicente Guerrero, p. 139 from Fernando D√≠az D√≠az, Caudillos y Caciques: Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna y Juan Alvarez. Mexico: Colegio de M√©xico 1972. p, 101 =First Empire and support of Guerrero in the early republic= After independence, when Iturbide was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico in 1822, √Ålvarez joined with Guerrero and Anastasio Bustamante to fight against Iturbide's monarchy. √Ålvarez supported Guerrero during the latter's presidency, fighting on his side in five battles. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1830. When Guerrero was overthrown by his vice-president, Bustamante, he joined √Ålvarez in the south, where they continued to resist. √Ålvarez tried to prevent Guerrero's execution in 1831, but was unable to do so. IN the 1830s, he continued to oppose Bustamante's centralism. =Defense of Mexico and the ouster of Santa Anna= In 1838, √Ålvarez fought the French invaders in the Pastry War. In 1841, he was promoted to general of division. In 1845, he was given the military command of Oaxaca and the Department of Acapulco. In 1847, as general in chief of the cavalry he fought at the head of a division in the defense of the capital against the Americans in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. His stature and importance as a liberal leader with much regional power was one of the factors that led to the creation of the State of Guerrero in 1849. He was named its first (interim) governor, and after elections in 1850, he became its first constitutional governor. He served in that position until 1853. On 1 March 1854 from Guerrero and seconded by Ignacio Comonfort, he proclaimed the Plan de Ayutla, a revolt against the dictatorship of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. √Ålvarez joined the revolt against Santa Anna when the president showed indications he would intrude in √Ålvarez's southern domain.Walter V. Scholes, Mexican Politics During the Ju√°rez Regime, Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press 1957, p. 3. Santa Anna was forced into exile in August 1855, and on 4 October 1855 in Cuernavaca, Morelos, √Ålvarez was installed as interim president of the Republic. =Presidency and reforms= On 14 November 1855, √Ålvarez rode into Mexico City in the company of a bodyguard composed of regular militia, citizens and indigenous fighters from the south. His administration was short, but his cabinet was brilliantly staffed: Ignacio Comonfort was Minister of War; Melchor Ocampo was foreign minister; Guillermo Prieto was Minister of the Treasury; and Benito Ju√°rez was Minister of Justice. In the 68 days that he governed, two measures were adopted that changed the destiny of Mexico: the convocation of a constituent congress that would write the Constitution of 1857, and the abolition of military and ecclesiastical fueros (privileges). The latter measure was the Ley Ju√°rez (\\"Law of Ju√°rez\\"). One of his concerns throughout his career, both military and political, was the return of lands to the Indigenous peoples of Mexico, and combating the oligarchic centralism that divided and caused huge losses to the country in favour of a liberal, republican and federal system. Urban life was disliked by √Ålvarez and he did not like the ways of the members of the high class of Mexico City, because of their centralist ideology and the affiliation of many of them to the conservative party, and because they sympathised with monarchic aspirations, oligarchic tendencies, snobbism, or have expressed antipathy and contempt towards the lower social classes, which nevertheless encompassed most of the Mexican citizens. Thus, because of √Ålvarez regionalism, liberalism, federalism and his leadership of indigenous soldiers, Mexico City was not very hospitable to him. And there was conflict in his cabinet between supporters of Comonfort and Manuel Doblado. For those reasons, and for reasons of health, √Ålvarez soon turned over the presidency to Ignacio Comonfort, another supporter of liberal reforms. √Ålvarez returned to Guerrero. On his departure he said: > Pobre entr√© a la Presidencia y pobre salgo de ella, pero con la satisfacci√≥n > que no pesa sobre m√≠ la censura p√∫blica, porque dedicado desde mi m√°s tierna > edad al trabajo personal, s√© manejar el arado para sostener a mi familia, > sin necesidad de los puestos p√∫blicos donde otros se enriquecen con ultraje > de la orfandad y la miseria. > I entered the presidency a poor man, and a poor man I leave it, with the > satisfaction that I do not bear the censure of the public because I was > dedicated from an early age to personal labor, to work the plow to maintain > my family, without the need for public offices where others enrich > themselves by outrages to those in misery. √Ålvarez continued to take an interest in politics, faithful to his liberal republican principles. He took an active part in the War of the Reform, in support of Ju√°rez. In 1861, Congress declared him Benem√©rito de la Patria. =The French intervention and the Second Empire= During the French intervention that led to the arrival of Maximilian of Habsburg to claim the throne of the Second Mexican Empire, √Ålvarez, now an old man, was in command of the Divisi√≥n del Sur. However, his son Diego was a high representative of the Empire in the Department of Acapulco. In 1862, President Ju√°rez, who remained in the country with his government during the entire time of the Empire, ordered the republican military commanders in the east, south and southwest to take orders from √Ålvarez if communications were broken with Ju√°rez. When Porfirio D√≠az escaped from French captivity, he joined √Ålvarez in the mountains of Guerrero. Death and legacy In 1867, √Ålvarez died on 21 August, a short time after the triumph of Mexican arms over the Empire, in his hacienda La Providencia, Guerrero, Mexico. On 25 December 1922, his remains were transferred with honors to the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres (Rotunda of Illustrious Men) in Mexico City. The municipalities of Atoyac de √Ålvarez and Chilapa de √Ålvarez in Guerrero are named in his honor, as is the airport at Acapulco, Juan N. √Ålvarez International Airport.

Different alleles painted in different colors. A diploid population of 10 individuals, that bottlenecked down to three individuals repeatedly, resulted in all individuals homozygous. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a cross chromosomal event that results in loss of the entire gene and the surrounding chromosomal region.[Association of the autoimmune diseases scleroderma with an immunologic response to cancer,] Christine G. Joseph et al., Science, 343:152 (10 January 2014) All diploid cells, for example most human somatic cells, contain two copies of the genome, one from each parent (chromosome pair); each human copy contains approximately 3 billion bases (adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) or thymine (T)). For the majority of positions in the genome the base present is consistent between individuals, however a small percentage may contain different bases (usually one of two; for instance, 'A' or 'G') and these positions are called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. When the genomic copies derived from each parent have different bases for these polymorphic regions (SNPs) the region is said to be heterozygous. Most of the chromosomes within somatic cells of individuals are paired, allowing for SNP locations to be potentially heterozygous. However, one parental copy of a region can sometimes be lost, which results in the region having just one copy. The single copy cannot be heterozygous at SNP locations and therefore the region shows loss of heterozygosity. Loss of heterozygosity due to loss of one parental copy in a region is also called hemizygosity in that region. In cancer The loss of heterozygosity is a common occurrence in cancer, where it indicates the absence of a functional tumor suppressor gene in the lost region. However, many people remain healthy with such a loss, because there still is one functional gene left on the other chromosome of the chromosome pair. The remaining copy of the tumor suppressor gene can be inactivated by a point mutation, leaving no tumor suppressor gene to protect the body. Loss of heterozygosity does not imply a homozygous state (which would require the presence of two identical alleles in the cell). =Knudson two-hit hypothesis of tumorigenesis= *First Hit: The first hit is classically thought of as a point mutation, but generally arises due to epigenetic events which inactivate one copy of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG), such as Rb1. In hereditary cancer syndromes, individuals are born with the first hit. The individual does not develop cancer at this point because the remaining TSG allele on the other locus is still functioning normally. *Second Hit: While the second hit is commonly assumed to be a deletion that results in loss of the remaining functioning TSG allele, the original published mechanism of RB1 LOH was mitotic recombination/gene conversion/copy-neutral LOH, not deletion. There is a critical difference between deletion and CN-LOH, as the latter mechanism cannot be detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-based gene copy number counting, and requires allelic genotyping. Either way, LOH leaves only non-functioning alleles of the TSG, and the individual may go on to develop cancer. =Copy-neutral LOH= Copy-neutral LOH is thus called because no net change in the copy number occurs in the affected individual. Possible causes for copy-neutral LOH include acquired uniparental disomy (UPD) and gene conversion. In UPD, a person receives two copies of a chromosome, or part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copies from the other parent due to errors in meiosis I or meiosis II. This acquired homozygosity could lead to development of cancer if the individual inherited a non-functional allele of a tumor suppressor gene. In tumor cells copy-neutral LOH can be biologically equivalent to the second hit in the Knudson hypothesis.Mao X, Young BD, Lu YJ. The application of single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays in cancer research. Curr Genomics. 2007 Jun;8(4):219‚Äì28. Acquired UPD is quite common in both hematologic and solid tumors, and is reported to constitute 20 to 80% of the LOH seen in human tumors.Gondek LP, Tiu R, O'Keefe CL, Sekeres MA, Theil KS, Maciejewski JP. Chromosomal lesions and uniparental disomy detected by SNP arrays in MDS, MDS/MPD, and MDS-derived AML.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2008 Mar;47(3):221‚Äì37. Determination of virtual karyotypes using SNP-based arrays can provide genome-wide copy number and LOH status, including detection of copy-neutral LOH. Copy-neutral LOH cannot be detected by arrayCGH, FISH, or conventional cytogenetics. SNP-based arrays are preferred for virtual karyotyping of tumors and can be performed on fresh or paraffin-embedded tissues. Copy-neutral LOH/uniparental disomy SNP array Virtual karyotype of a colorectal carcinoma (whole genome view) demonstrating deletions, gains, amplifications, and acquired UPD (copy-neutral LOH). =Retinoblastoma= The classical example of such a loss of protecting genes is hereditary retinoblastoma, in which one parent's contribution of the tumor suppressor Rb1 is flawed. Although most cells will have a functional second copy, chance loss of heterozygosity events in individual cells almost invariably lead to the development of this retinal cancer in the young child. =Breast Cancer and BRCA1/2= The genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 show loss of heterozygosity in samplings of tumors from patients who have germline mutations. BRCA1/2 are genes that produce proteins which regulate the DNA repair pathway by binding to Rad51. Detection Loss of heterozygosity can be identified in cancers by noting the presence of heterozygosity at a genetic locus in an organism's germline DNA, and the absence of heterozygosity at that locus in the cancer cells. This is often done using polymorphic markers, such as microsatellites or single-nucleotide polymorphisms, for which the two parents contributed different alleles. Genome-wide LOH status of fresh or paraffin embedded tissue samples can be assessed by virtual karyotyping using SNP arrays. In asexual organisms It has been proposed that LOH may limit the longevity of asexual organisms.Tucker AE, Ackerman MA, Eads BD, Xu S, Lynch M. Population-genomic insights into the evolutionary origin and fate of obligately asexual Daphnia pulex. PNAS. 2013; 110:15740.Archetti M. Recombination and loss of complementation: A more than two-fold cost for parthenogenesis. J Evol Biol 2004; 17(5):1084‚Äì1097. The minor allele in heterozygous areas of the genome is likely to have mild fitness consequences compared to de-novo mutations because selection has had time to remove deleterious alleles. When allelic gene conversion removes the major allele at these sites organisms are likely to experience a mild decline in fitness. Because LOH is much more common than de-novo mutation, and because the fitness consequences are closer to neutrality, this process should drive Muller's ratchet more quickly than de-novo mutations. While this process has received little experimental investigation, it is known that major signature of asexuality in metazoan genomes appears to be genome wide LOH, a sort of anti- meselson effect.

It was originally published by Maximum Press, and later by Image Comics, through Homage Comics, a publishing imprint of Wildstorm. Subsequent projects would be published by Darkchylde Entertainment, through Wowio. Darkchylde is the story of Ariel Chylde, a cursed teen who can become the creatures from her many nightmares, and then must save her small town from the forces of darkness she's set free. Publication history Darkchylde was launched as a comic book property to immediate success in the summer of 1996. The book shot to the #1 hottest comics spot in Wizard, where it stayed for nine months collectively in both Wizard and Combo magazines.http://www.darkchylde.com/story.html The book outsold Spider-Man, the Hulk, Superman, and Batman in America, and quickly garnered an unusually large female following, in stark contrast to the traditionally male comic book market. The success of the books spawned a line of best-selling trading cards, action figures, skateboards, lunch-boxes, lithos, apparel, and mini-bust statues. When the book was launched overseas to foreign audiences, it quickly became Panini Publishing's best selling title, overselling all of their classic superhero titles, including both Spider-Man and the X-Men. Wizard magazine released Darkchylde #1/2, a mail order-only comic that outsold all of their previous mail order comics. Creator Randy Queen created Darkchylde Entertainment with partner Sarah Oates and launched \\"Dreams of the Darkchylde\\" #1. It was the best-selling independent title offered that month in Previews, the magazine for comic distribution orders. In a second interview with Nicholas Yanes from scifipulse.net Queen revealed that Darkchylde would appear in a published comic book after several years of absence. This comic book would be a one-shot crossover titled The Darkness/ Darkchylde: Kingdom Pain\\" and scheduled to come out in December 2009. In addition to containing a new story feature Darkchylde, this one-shot also contained preview art for Randy Queen's next comic book title \\"Starfall.\\" =Manga Darkchylde= In 2005 the title was relaunched at Dark Horse Comics as Manga Darkchylde, with Ariel now being a little girl. (The term manga in the title is somewhat misleading, as the new series is clearly not a manga in the traditional sense and actually bears very little resemblance to Japanese manga in any way.) Only using the base elements of the original Darkchylde, Randy Queen is now expanding his \\"Darkchylde-universe\\".

In an interview with Nicholas Yanes from scifipulse.net, Randy Queen was asked and responded to a question about a film/television adaptation of Darkchylde: Test footage from the set of Darkchylde emerged in July 2010 and on October 31, 2010, it was announced John Carpenter was to direct. The project has since seen no further comment from Carpenter or Queen, and is believed to be in Development Hell or shelved by the production company. Tumblr depictions and subsequent DMCA takedown notices In August 2014 Randy Queen, owner of the character, filed numerous DMCA Takedown Requests regarding Escher Girls, a Tumblr blog which critiques the anatomical inaccuracies of women featured in comic art. The notices were filed in response to posts critical of Queen's work, specifically a piece of art published on the blog nine times with encouragement for others to correct it with redraws - a piece of art created 18 years ago while the artist was still learning. Queen felt his work was being used in an abusive and misleading manner, and exercised due process with Tumblr in having his copyrighted images removed from the blog. Tumblr erroneously removed the entire post, which included commentary. Subsequently, Queen apologized on his Facebook page regarding the incident and asked Tumblr to restore the content, which they did.

(doing business as Little Caesars) is the third-largest pizza chain in the United States, behind Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizza. It operates and franchises pizza restaurants in the United States and internationally in Asia, the Middle East, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Detroit, Michigan, headquartered in the Fox Theatre building in Downtown Detroit.\\"Franchise Opportunities\\". (Archive) Little Caesars. 5/5. Retrieved November 2, 2009. Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Ilitch Holdings, Inc. History Little Caesars Pizza was founded on May 8, 1959, by Mike Ilitch and his wife Marian Ilitch. The first location was in a strip mall in Garden City, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and named \\"Little Caesar's Pizza Treat\\". The original store closed in October 2018. The company is famous for its advertising catchphrase \\"Pizza! Pizza!\\", which was introduced in 1979. The phrase refers to two pizzas being offered for the comparable price of a single pizza from competitors. Originally, the pizzas were served in a single long package (a piece of corrugated cardboard in 2-by-1 proportions, with two square pizzas, placed side by side, then slid into a form-fitting paper sleeve that was folded and stapled closed). Little Caesars has since discarded the unwieldy packaging in favor of typical pizza boxes. In addition to pizza with \\"exotic\\" toppings, they served hot dogs, chicken, shrimp, and fish. In 1998, Little Caesars filled what was then the largest pizza order, filling an order of 13,386 pizzas from the VF Corporation of Greensboro, North Carolina. Starting in 1997, the chain introduced shaker boards to advertise the \\"Hot-N- Ready\\", a large pepperoni pizza sold for $5. The concept was successful enough to become a permanent fixture of the chain, and Little Caesars' business model has shifted to focus more on carryout. Little Caesars was among the first to use a new kind of speed-cooking conveyor oven, the \\"Rotary Air Impingement Oven\\". On December 10, 2014, Little Caesars announced plans for a new eight- story, 205,000-square-foot Global Resource Center to be built at Woodward Avenue and Columbia Street in downtown Detroit. Intended to double the size of Little Caesars World Headquarters Campus, the new building's location was chosen near the Fox Office Center building, which houses both the Fox Theatre, and 186,000 square feet of office space for Little Caesars, and other Ilitch- affiliated ventures. An overhead pedestrian bridge over Columbia Street was planned to connect the Fox with the new Little Caesars Global Resource Center, and workspace for an additional 600 jobs to be brought to Detroit over time. On January 31, 2016, it was announced that the proposed new Little Caesars Pizza Global Resource Center had grown by one floor to be a nine-story building at Woodward and Columbia Street. The building was scheduled to be completed in 2018, but in October of that year, was pushed back due to construction delays. In 2017, to coincide with the opening of Little Caesars Arena, the company launched a slightly updated logo, which removed Caesar's chest hair, updated the wreath, and updated the toga to have hidden letters spelling \\"LC\\" for \\"Little Caesars\\". The company also started using the updated Caesar in its advertising, replacing the more cartoonish Caesar that had been used in ads since the 1980s. Corporate Fox Theatre, where the headquarters of Little Caesars is located Ilitch Holdings, Inc. manages professional services to companies owned by Marian Ilitch. These include the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (whose NHL arena, as of 2017, is named for the pizza chain), the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball, Blue Line Foodservice Distribution, Little Caesars Pizza Kits, Champion Foods, Olympia Entertainment, Olympia Development, Uptown Entertainment, the Hockeytown Cafe (also the site of City Theater), and the Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit. =Trademark= While Little Caesars owns the \\"Pizza! Pizza!\\" trademark in the U.S., the unaffiliated Canadian Pizza Pizza restaurant chain (founded in Toronto in 1967, twelve years before Little Caesars began using its trademarked version in the United States) owns the Canadian trademark. As a result, Little Caesars cannot directly use the slogan in Canada, due to a copyright claim by JAD Productions Corporation. Instead, the company has used \\"Two Pizzas!\\" along with \\"Delivery! Delivery!\\", \\"Quality! Quality!\\" or other such double-word tag lines in its advertising and packaging in Canada. They have used \\"Hot 'N Ready!\\" in their TV commercials for their \\"Hot 'N Ready\\" pizzas. Franchising Franchise in Marquette, Michigan A Little Caesars in Gillette, Wyoming Little Caesars sold its first franchise in 1962 and, by 1987, had restaurants in all 50 states. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Little Caesars were commonly found in Kmart stores, more specifically in Big Kmarts and Super Kmarts. The first Kmart and the first Little Caesars were both built-in Garden City, Michigan. After Kmart's bankruptcy issues, some of today's Kmarts have replaced the Little Caesars with their own branded \\"K-Cafe\\". However, several Little Caesars remain. Little Caesars pizza was also included in many remodeled Kmart locations. Between 2008 and 2015, Little Caesars was the fastest-growing pizza chain in the United States. , the company has 5,463 locations including U.S. and international units. =International growth= By 1987, the company was operating across the Northern United States, purchasing the Mother's Pizza chain out of receivership in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom in 1989. As of 2020, the company is present in Canada (some Canadian cities had locations since 1969), Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Guatemala, Barbados, Bahamas, Saudi Arabia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Bahrain, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, Singapore, and India. The Little Caesars brand in the Philippines was present since the 1990s but gradually closed down in the 2000s. It reentered the market 25 January 2019, with its launching under a new franchisee and new branch in Ermita, Manila. In 2019, Little Caesars restaurants in Australia closed their doors and went into administration, having entered the Australian market in 2014. Little Caesars entered the Indian market on January 29, 2020, opening two stores in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Products Little Caesars produces a variety of pizzas. Several core menu items are part of the HOT-N-READY menu, designed to make popular items available for immediate carry-out, while others are considered either specialty pizzas or custom pizzas. In 2013, they added the Deep!Deep! Dish Pizza, a Detroit-style pizza, to the menu. Select locations also offer salads. Additional entr√©e options include flavored Caesar Wings and bread, such as Crazy Bread and Italian Cheese Bread. Select locations offer salads. All Little Caesars locations carry Pepsi products. In 1996, they introduced Pizza by the Foot, which was a 3-foot long, rectangular pizza. The product has since been discontinued, however its equivalent Pizza by the Meter has been sold in the Saudi Arabian market since the 90s and is a very popular product. .{{cite weburl=https://littlecaesarsksa.com/product/pizza-by-the-meter/ On occasion, Little Caesars releases limited time offers. In 2014, they introduced the Soft Pretzel Crust Pizza, and in 2015, the \\"Bacon Wrapped Deep! Deep! Dish Pizza.\\" In May 2019, Little Caesars began testing a pizza with meatless sausage made by Impossible Foods. In June 2020, Little Caesars introduced stuffed crazy bread. https://www.brandeating.com/2020/06/little-caesars-bakes-new-stuffed- crazy-bread.html Community outreach  =Love Kitchen= The Little Caesars Love Kitchen is a kitchen on wheels that serves pizza to those in need. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush recognized the Love Kitchen by awarding Little Caesars with The President's Volunteer Action Award Citation. =Veterans Program= In 2006, Little Caesars started its Veterans Program, which provides incentives to honorably discharged veterans looking to open their own business when transitioning back to civilian life or seeking a career change. Mike Ilitch was inspired to start the program after hearing a story about a veteran, who lost both legs in the war, returning to civilian life.

He was a moderate Liberal. His family still influences Mexican politics, and some of his grandsons (Francisco Carrera Torres, Alberto Carrera Torres, and Fausto Carrera Torres), were revolutionaries in the Mexican Revolution. Biography Carrera entered the military at the age of 9 as a cadet in the Expeditionary Regiment of King Ferdinand VII of Spain. By 1818, he was an instructor in New Spain. He joined the insurgent Army of the Three Guarantees after the Battle of Huerta (30 August 1821). He was with the army when it triumphally entered Mexico City on 27 September 1821. A lieutenant by the age of 16, he commanded a battery of artillery during the siege of the Spanish in San Juan de Ul√∫a in 1822. Later he was director of the arsenal and commander of artillery at San Luis Potos√≠. He defended the government of President Guadalupe Victoria at the time of the \\"Mot√≠n de la Acordada\\", an insurrection led by General Jos√© Mar√≠a Lobato and Lorenzo de Zavala in favor of Vicente Guerrero (30 November 1828). In 1831, he was named commander of La Ciudadela in Mexico City. Carrera was promoted to brigadier general in 1840 and to general of division in 1853. He was commander of the artillery of the Mexican Army for much of his career. He was a member of the National Legislative Junta charged with writing the Bases Org√°nicas (constitution) in 1843 and senator of the Republic from 1844 to 1846. Carrera was commander of artillery in the Valley of Mexico at the time of the United States invasion. He fought in the battles of Padierna (20 August 1847), Molino del Rey (6 September), and Battle of Casa Mata (11 September). After the war he was military governor of the Federal District (1853‚Äì55). When Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna resigned the presidency because of the Plan de Ayutla, a junta of representatives named Carrera interim president to replace him. He served from 15 August to 12 September 1855. On 20 August 1855, in compliance with the Plan de Ayutla, he called elections for a constituent congress. Under pressure from supporters and opponents of the Plan de Ayutla, he resigned in September, turning the office over to R√≥mulo D√≠az de la Vega. He then retired to private life in Mexico City. Carrera did not take part in the Reform War. At the time of the French invasion, he offered his services to President Benito Ju√°rez, but did not serve in Ju√°rez's government or military. He wrote the military treatises Uso y pr√°cticas de maniobra de artiller√≠a ligera de monta√±a (San Luis Potos√≠, 1831) and Notas de campa√±a (1843). He died in Mexico City in 1871 at the age of 64. Two of his great grandchildren were Alberto Carrera Torres and Francisco Carrera Torres, members of the Army of the Northern Division in the Mexican Revolution.

From 8 February 1853 to 20 April 1853, he served as president of Mexico. Biography He joined the army at age 12, enlisting as a cadet in the Company of Patriots of Tacubaya during the Mexican War of Independence. After the war, he retired from the army, but returned in 1832. In 1836, he fought in the Texas War, where he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and in 1838 in the Pastry War against France. In 1847, during the United States invasion, he gained fame at the Battle of Buena Vista. Also in 1847, he was given the military command of the state of Quer√©taro. In 1849, he became commander of the army (jefe de la plana mayor del ej√©rcito). In 1853, now a brigadier, he received command of the state of Mexico. In 1853, he took part in the revolt of Jalisco against General Mariano Arista, who was serving as president. Juan Bautista Ceballos occupied the presidency briefly, and then transferred power to Lombardini as provisional president. Lombardini served from 8 February 1853 to 20 April 1853, when Santa Anna returned to the presidency from exile in Jamaica. As president, he improved the roads to Veracruz and Acapulco and regulated navigation on Lake Chalco. He also founded the school of engineering at the Academia de San Carlos and introduced certain policy initiatives, such as an order to require convicted criminals in Mexico City to receive instruction in Christian doctrine. Lombardini wrote a famous letter to the Mexican politician and political theorist Lucas Alam√°n that outlined the principles that should underpin the political program of conservatives. He approved Alam√°n's reasoning and prepared an electoral charade to legitimize the return of ex-president Santa Anna. Before handing over power, Lombardini issued a decree by which Santa Anna was appointed \\"Captain General of sea and land, with absolute powers\\". Shortly afterwards he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army and Commanding General. Santa Anna also named him commander of the garrison of Mexico City, where he would die a few months later, in December.

He received his education there, culminating in a law degree from the College of San Nicol√°s in 1835. While at the college, he became friends with Melchor Ocampo and Santos Degollado. In 1842, and again in 1851, he was elected to the Mexican Congress. From May 1852 to January 1853, he was president of the Mexican Supreme Court. In this position, he succeeded to the presidency when the conservatives forced Mariano Arista from office on 6 January 1853. Shortly after becoming president, he asked Congress for the extraordinary powers it had denied to Arista, and they were granted. Nevertheless, Congress rejected many of his initiatives, and he dissolved it militarily on 19 January 1853, calling for a constitutional convention. Congress continued to meet in a private house, naming Juan M√∫jica y Osorio as president, but M√∫jica did not accept. This led to intervention by the Mexico City garrison under Manuel Robles Pezuela, which removed Ceballos and made General Manuel Mar√≠a Lombardini president (Plan de Hospicio). Ceballos returned to the Supreme Court. In 1856, he was elected deputy from Michoac√°n and Colima to the Constituent Congress (1856‚Äì57).

According to the Statistics Canada 2016 census, 20.7% of Newfoundlanders claim Irish ancestry (other major groups in the province include 37.5% English, 6.8% Scottish, and 5.2% French). However, this figure greatly under-represents the true number of Newfoundlanders of Irish ancestry, as 53.9% claimed \\"Canadian\\" as their ethnic origin in the same census. The majority of these respondents were of Irish, English, and Scottish origins, but no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins due to having lived in Canada for many generations. Even so, the family names, the features and colouring, the predominance of Catholics in some areas (particularly on the southeast portion of the Avalon Peninsula), the prevalence of Irish music, and even the accents of the people in these areas, are so reminiscent of rural Ireland that Irish author Tim Pat Coogan has described Newfoundland as \\"the most Irish place in the world outside of Ireland\\",Tim Pat Coogan, Wherever Green Is Worn: The Story of the Irish Diaspora.

History The large Irish Catholic element in Newfoundland in the 19th century played a major role in Newfoundland history, and developed a strong local culture of their own.Johanne Devlin Trew, \\"The Forgotten Irish? Contested sites and narratives of nation in Newfoundland.\\" Ethnologies 27#2 (2005): 43-77. They were in repeated political conflict‚Äîsometimes violent‚Äîwith the Protestant Scots-Irish \\"Orange\\" element.John Edward FitzGerald, Conflict and culture in Irish-Newfoundland Roman Catholicism, 1829-1850 (University of Ottawa, 1997.) The Irish migrations to Newfoundland, and the associated provisions trade, represent the oldest and most enduring connections between Ireland and North America. As early as 1536, the ship Mighel (Michael) of Kinsale is recorded returning to her home port in County Cork with consignments of Newfoundland fish and cod liver oil. A further hint of what one scholar has termed a diaspora of Irish fishermen dates from 1608, when Patrick Brannock, a Waterford mariner, was reported to sail yearly to Newfoundland. Beginning around 1670, and particularly between 1750 and 1830, Newfoundland received large numbers of Irish immigrants. These migrations were seasonal or temporary. Most Irish migrants were young men working on contract for English merchants and planters. It was a substantial migration, peaking in the 1770s and 1780s when more than 100 ships and 5,000 men cleared Irish ports for the fishery. The exodus from Ulster to the United States excepted, it was the most substantial movement of Irish across the Atlantic in the 18th century. Some went on to other North American destinations, some stayed, and many engaged in what has been called \\"to-ing and fro-ing\\", an annual seasonal migration between Ireland and Newfoundland due to fisheries and trade. As a result, the Newfoundland Irish remained in constant contact with news, politics, and cultural movements back in Ireland. Virtually from its inception, a small number of young Irish women joined the migration. They tended to stay and marry overwintering Irish male migrants. Seasonal and temporary migrations slowly evolved into emigration and the formation of permanent Irish family settlement in Newfoundland. This pattern intensified with the collapse of the old migratory cod fishery after 1790. An increase in Irish immigration, particularly of women, between 1800 and 1835, and the related natural population growth, helped transform the social, demographic, and cultural character of Newfoundland. In 1836, the government in St. John's commissioned a census that exceeded in its detail anything recorded to that time. More than 400 settlements were listed. The Irish, and their offspring, composed half of the total population.John Mannion, PNLA Exhibit, 1996 as cited in National Adult Literacy Database guidebook on Newfoundland multiculturalism Close to three-quarters of them lived in St. John's and its near hinterland, from Renews to Carbonear, an area still known as the Irish Shore. There were more Catholic Irish concentrated in this relatively restricted stretch of shore than in any comparable location in Canada. Location Plaque in Waterford, Ireland The vast majority of Irish in Newfoundland arrived from the counties of Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford, Dingle, in Counties Kerry, and Cork. No other provinces in Canada or U.S. state drew such an overwhelming proportion of their immigrants from so geographically compact an area in Ireland over so prolonged a period of time. Waterford city was the primary port of embarkation. Most migrants came from within a day's journey to the city, or its outport at Passage, 10 km (6 mi) down river in Waterford Harbour. They were drawn from parishes and towns along the main routes of transport and communication, both river and road, converging on Waterford and Passage. New Ross and Youghal were secondary centres of transatlantic embarkation. Old river ports such as Carrick on Suir and Clonmel on the River Suir, Inistioge and Thomastown on the River Nore, and Graiguenamanagh on the River Barrow were important centers of recruitment. So were the rural parishes along these navigable waterways. Probably the principal motivation for migration was economic distress in the homeland. The population almost doubled between 1785 and 1835, the main period of emigration. Land scarcity, unemployment, underemployment, and the promise of higher wages attracted young Irish women and men to Newfoundland. Irrespective of economic or social origins, almost all Irish moved primarily to better their economic lot. Language and culture Newfoundland Tricolour Official flag of the Republic of Ireland Most Irish emigrants arrived between 1750 and 1830 from strongly Irish-speaking counties, chiefly in Munster. For the decennial period 1771-1781 the number of Irish speakers in a number of those counties can be estimated as follows: County Kilkenny 57%, County Tipperary 51%, County Waterford 86%, County Kerry 93% and County Cork 84%.See Fitzgerald 1984. Newfoundland is one of the few places outside Ireland where the Irish language was spoken by much of the population as their primary language. It is also the only place outside Europe with its own distinctive name in the Irish language, Talamh an √âisc (Land of the Fish). The Irish language (in its local Munster-derived form) influenced the distinctive varieties of Newfoundland English. The form of the Irish language known as Newfoundland Irish was associated with an inherited culture of stories, poetry, folklore, traditional feast days, hurling and faction fighting, and flourished for a time in a series of local enclaves. Irish-speaking interpreters were occasionally needed in the courts.Kirwan 1993, p. 68. Native speakers are likely to have existed even after the First World War.‚ÄòAloysius O‚ÄôBrien, 93: Agronomist,‚Äô J.M. O‚ÄôSullivan, 13 October 2008, The Globe and Mail. To Newfoundland the Irish brought family names of southeast Ireland: Wade, McCarthy, O'Rourke, Walsh, Nash, Houlihan, Connors, Hogan, Shea, Stamp, Maher, O'Reilly, Keough, Power, Murphy, Ryan, Griffin, Whelan, O'Brien, Kelly, Hanlon, Neville, Bambrick, Halley, Dillon, Byrne, Lake and FitzGerald. The many Newfoundlanders with the surname Crockwell (√ì Creachmhaoil) derive from 19th Century immigrants from County Galway, in the west of Ireland. Many of the island's more prominent landmarks having already been named by early French and English explorers, but Irish placenames include Ballyhack (Baile Hac), Cappahayden (Ceapach √âid√≠n), Kilbride and St. Bride's (Cill Bhr√≠de), Duntara, Port Kirwan and Skibbereen (Scibir√≠n). Elements of material culture, agricultural folkways, vernacular and ecclesiastical architecture endured, and trace elements remain. But the commercial cod fishery and the presence of so many English produced a new, composite culture, that of modern Newfoundlanders, a culture unique in modern North America. Despite the Irish elements in the culture of modern Newfoundland, little attention has been given to the (now moribund) local variety of the Irish language. An exception was the work of the local scholar Aloysius (Aly) O‚ÄôBrien, who died in 2008. Tuition in Irish (of a kind not specific to Newfoundland) is available at Memorial University of Newfoundland, which every year appoints an Irish language instructor from abroad. Religion Religious faith had great institutional importance. Several of the leading Irish merchants and propertied men were Protestants and brought the traditions of the Orange Order to their new home. But the majority of the Irish were Roman Catholics, and they brought with them a version of Catholicism which was strongly marked by belief in fairies, magic, omens, charms and protective rituals. This tended to reduce their dependence on the Church, which seemed to have no monopoly on the supernatural.Connolly 1982, p. 119-120. Over time, however, the Church managed to impose its discipline in Newfoundland as it had in Ireland, and it became the single most important ethnic, social and cultural institution for the Catholic Irish in Newfoundland. Its clergy and leaders were the de facto leaders of the Irish community. With Irish being the language of the majority in the early period, it was often the language of church services.O‚ÄôGrady 2004, p. 56 The Catholic Bishop James Louis O'Donel, when requesting a Franciscan missionary for the parishes of St. Mary's and Trepassey, said that such a missionary would need to be fluent in Irish (like O'Donel himself).Newfoundland: The Most Irish Place Outside of Ireland, Brian McGinn, the Irish Diaspora Studies scholarly network It also played a part in the greatest early challenge to the Catholic Church, when the Reverend Laurence Coughlan, a Methodist preacher, managed to convert most of the Newfoundland North Shore in the 1760s largely because of his fluency in Irish. =Irish Catholic religious orders= As the permanent population, and the numbers of young people and children in Newfoundland increased during the early 19th century, public interest in access to education also grew. Bishop Michael Anthony Fleming was aware of this and of the religious opportunities that it presented. He wanted \\"cradle-to-grave\\" cultural institutions for Irish Roman Catholics and, in particular, wanted to address the needs and aspirations of working class Catholics. He therefore recruited religious orders of women from Ireland. In March 1833, Bishop Fleming went to Galway, Ireland, where he sought several sisters of the order of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary to open a school for female children in Newfoundland. In 1839 he also invited the Sisters of Mercy. The work of the two orders was the basis of Catholic and inter-denominational education for the next century and a half. Over the next century parents of all denominations sent children to be educated in their convents. In 1847 Bishop Fleming recruited four brothers of the Third Order of Saint Francis from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam, Ireland, to teach at the Benevolent Irish Society's school. =Building a cathedral= The rapid growth of the Irish population in St. John's during the early years of the 19th century that the Catholic chapel had to be repeatedly enlarged. By the mid-1830s the Old Chapel had long outlived its usefulness and Bishop Fleming wanted a more commodious church. He and his successor, Bishop John T. Mullock, supervised the construction. The Basilica of St. John the Baptist was built between 1839-1855 of stone imported from Ireland and was one of the largest Cathedrals in North America at the time of its construction. Rebellion In 1800, a cell of the Society of United Irishmen was uncovered in the St. John's Garrison and planned to rebel against the English authority in the United Irish Uprising, making Newfoundland one of the few places outside Ireland in which the Irish Rebellion of 1798 had political effects. Even at the time of the Napoleonic Wars, political activism rooted in Irish agrarian movements manifested themselves in Newfoundland, in such forms such as the Caravats (), who wore French cravates (ties) and the Shanavests ( \\"Old Vests\\"). BIS building, St. Patrick's Hall, St. John's, Newfoundland Benevolent Irish Society In the early years of the 19th century St. John's had a large Irish population with some members of affluence. It was a town with growing influence, and was the cradle of growing cultural and political ferment. Members of the local Irish middle class saw social needs unmet by government and also wanted to belong to a fraternal, gentlemanly organization. In 1806, under Bishop O'Donel's patronage, they founded the Benevolent Irish Society (the BIS) as a charitable, non-profit, non-sectarian society for Irish-born men under the motto \\"He who gives to the poor lends to the Lord\\". In 1823 the BIS collected a subscription and opened a non-sectarian school, the Orphan Asylum, in St. John's, for the education of the poor. Irish fraternities Outside the Benevolent Irish Society (BIS), there were two fraternal organizations to which Irish Catholics in Newfoundland belonged. The earliest to be established in Newfoundland was the Irish Mechanics' Society, organized in March 1827. The Mechanics' Society was established as a self-help and educational society by four skilled tradesmen, Patrick Kelly, Edmond Power, Louis Martin, and William Walsh. The Society provided a meeting place and educational opportunities for its members, a sickness insurance scheme, and a program of benefits for injured members or the families of deceased members. Many of the early members of the Mechanics' Society were Irish Catholics from St. John's, but intra-Irish county origins, and membership in Irish provincial factions the Tipperary Clear Airs, the Wexford Yellowbellies, the Waterford Wheybellies, the Kilkenny Doones, and the Cork Dadyeens may also have played a part in determining its membership. Like the Benevolent Irish Society, the rules of the Mechanics' Society prohibited members from formally discussing political or religious questions, but the Society occasionally took a public political stand. In 1829 it participated in a large parade through St. John's to celebrate the Catholic emancipation. Many of its early leaders became prominent in political life. The Irish temperance movement was founded in Cork, Ireland in April 1838 by the Franciscan priest, Father Theobald Mathew. In 1841 the movement was introduced to St. John's by Father Kyran Walsh. During the 1840s and into the 1860s, the Newfoundland Temperance Society became one of the most popular working class fraternal organizations in St. John's. In the context of Irish culture and politics, the Irish temperance movement in Newfoundland also became a political forum for lobbying for the repeal of the Acts of Union 1800 that united Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain, particularly during the Repeal Year of 1843. By 1844, over 10,000 members had enrolled and by the late 19th century, the society developed a substantial membership and social presence in St. John's. In the early 20th century, the society became renowned for its literary and musical events, and remained one of the most active and influential fraternal societies in St. John's until the 1990s.

Early life and education Manuel de la Pe√±a y Pe√±a was born in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (colonial M√©xico). He was a scholarship student at Seminario Conciliar. He graduated in civil and ecclesiastical jurisprudence on 16 December 1811 as valedictorian of his class. Career =Mexico= On 26 December 1813, he was named a trustee of the Mexico City government. On 23 February 1820, he was named by the Crown to the Audiencia of Quito, a position he was unable to fill because of the 1821 independence of Mexico. From 10 April 1822, he was a public prosecutor, at a very young age for this position. On 21 October 1822, Emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide named him minister plenipotentiary to Colombia, but he was unable to occupy this position either, because of the fall of the empire. After the promulgation of the federal constitution, which created the Mexican Supreme Court, he was named to a seat in that body (25 December 1824). Except for a few short gaps, he retained this position until his death. On 22 April 1837, he was named Minister of the Interior, and on 16 November 1838 he was appointed to the Supremo Poder Conservador. He was also a law professor at Universidad Nacional de M√©xico, president of the Academy of Jurisprudence, and rector of the College of Lawyers. On 4 December 1841, he was named to edit the Civil Code. On 3 October 1843, he was designated a senator of the Republic, and he was reelected to that position on 19 November 1845. In 1845, he was also Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior, and plenipotentiary to negotiate an extradition treaty with the Spanish envoy. =Presidency= In 1847, because of the governmental chaos after the United States occupation of the capital, Pe√±a y Pe√±a assumed the interim presidency of the country in his capacity as president of the Supreme Court and by act of Congress. He served from 26 September to 13 November 1847, when he was replaced by Pedro Mar√≠a Anaya. The government was at that time in Quer√©taro. He was later named president in his own right (not interim) from 8 January to 3 June 1848. The state of Yucat√°n had seceded from the federation, Michoac√°n declared sovereignty, and many other states were ignoring the federal government. During his term of office, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war with the United States, was negotiated and signed. Negotiations began on 2 January 1848 and concluded on 2 February. Mexico ceded Texas, New Mexico and Alta California to the United States and received a payment of 15 million dollars. The treaty had much opposition in Congress, which was meeting in Quer√©taro, but considering the state of the country and the inability to continue the war, Congress ratified it on 13 May 1848. With the conclusion of the treaty, Pe√±a y Pe√±a resigned the presidency and returned to the Supreme Court. Congress elected General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera president.

It is an elaboration of his teacher's, Zellig Harris's, model of transformational generative grammar. A short monograph of about a hundred pages, Chomsky's presentation is recognized as one of the most significant studies of the 20th century, and in 2011 was selected by Time magazine as one of the 100 most important nonfiction books ever written. It contains the now-famous sentence \\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\\", which Chomsky offered as an example of a grammatically correct sentence that has no discernible meaning. Thus, Chomsky argued for the independence of syntax (the study of sentence structures) from semantics (the study of meaning).From :\\"...such semantic notions as reference, significance, and synonymity played no role in the discussion.\\" Based on lecture notes he had prepared for his students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomsky's first book presented contemporary developments in early generative grammar. The approach to syntax is fully formal (based on symbols and rules). At its base, Chomsky uses phrase structure rules,From : \\"In ¬ß¬ß3-7 we outlined the development of some fundamental linguistic concepts in purely formal terms.\\" which break down sentences into smaller parts. These are combined with a new kind of rules which Chomsky called \\"transformations\\". This procedure gives rise to different sentence structures. Reiterating notions introduced to linguistics by the Danish linguist Louis Hjelmslev, Chomsky stated that this limited set of rules \\"generates\\"Here, \\"generate\\" means giving a clear structural description of each sentence. In , Chomsky writes that \\"When we speak of a grammar as generating a sentence with a certain structural description, we mean simply that the grammar assigns this structural description to the sentence.\\" all and only the grammatical sentences of a given language, which are infinite in number. It was later interpreted that this way of study valued language's place in the mind over language behavior although such ideas are not explicitly stated in the book. Hjelmslev and other European linguists in contrast had considered the generative calculus as perfectly non-psychological. The significance of Syntactic Structures lies in Chomsky‚Äôs persuasion for a biological perspective on language at a time when it was unusual and in the context of formal linguistics where it was unexpected. Chomsky eventually became recognised as one of the founders of what is now known as sociobiology. Another reason for the fame of Syntactic Structures was that Hjelmslev died in 1965 after which generative grammarians were not clear about the origin of the theory. Written when he was still an unknown scholar, writes: \\"[Chomsky] was at the time an unknown 28-year-old who taught language classes at MIT\\" Syntactic Structures had a major impact on the study of knowledge, mind and mental processes, being an influential work in the formation of the field of cognitive science. It also significantly influenced research on computers and the brain.See the \\"Reception\\" section of this article. Some specialists have questioned the theory, believing it is wrong to describe language as an ideal system. They also say it gives less value to the gathering and testing of data.See the \\"Criticisms\\" section of this article. Nevertheless, American linguistics changed course in the second half of the 20th century as a result of Syntactic Structures. Background =Situatedness in linguistic theory= At the time of its publication, Syntactic Structures presented the state of the art of Zellig Harris's formal model of language analysis which is called transformational generative grammar. It can also be said to present Chomsky's version or Chomsky's theory because there is some original input on a more technical level. The central concepts of the model however follow from Louis Hjelmslev's book Prolegomena to a Theory of Language which was published in 1943 in Danish and followed by an English translation by Francis J. Whitfield in 1953. The book sets up an algebraic tool for linguistic analysis which consists of terminals and inventories of all different types of linguistic units, similarly to terminal and nonterminal symbols in formal grammars. First, it functions as a descriptive device, or as Hjelmslev explains it: When this work is done to a satisfactory level, it will also become possible to predict all the grammatical sentences of a given language: Hjelmslev also points out that an algorithmic description of a language could generate an infinite number of products from a finite number of primitive elements: These are logical consequences of the mathematical systems proposed by David Hilbert and Rudolf Carnap which were first adopted into linguistics by Hjelmslev whose ideas are reiterated by Chomsky: Chomsky likewise states that a recursive device such as closed loops would allow the grammar to generate an infinite number of sentences. There are however some major points of divergence from Hjelmslev's conception. Hjelmslev was a structuralist and applied mathematical models to Ferdinand de Saussure's concept of language as an interactive system of meaning and form. Although the Bloomfieldian school of early to mid-20th century linguists were nicknamed 'American structuralists', they essentially rejected the basic tenets of structuralism: that linguistic form is explained through meaning, and that linguistics belongs to the domain of sociology. Instead, the idea of language endorsed by Leonard Bloomfield and his followers derived from William Wundt's mentalistic psychology which was replaced by behavioural psychology in Bloomfield's 1933 book Language. This led to the separation of syntax from semantics as not an observable link in a stimulus‚Äìresponse chain. Chomsky, like Harris and other American linguists, agreed that there is no causal link from semantics to syntax. Despite the paradigm shift, American linguists maintained Wundt's syntactic analysis which entails the placement of the grammatical object into the verb phrase. They believed that languages should be analysed based on how native speakers feel is right. How to translate this idea into a scientific statement remained a vexing issue in American linguistics for decades. Harris and Rulon Wells justified analysing the object as part of the verb phrase per 'economy'; but this term, again, merely suggested the perceived 'easiness' of the practice. In Syntactic Structures, Chomsky changes the meaning of Hjelmslev's principle of arbitrariness which meant that the generative calculus is merely a tool for the linguist and not a structure in reality. David Lightfoot however points out in his introduction to the second edition that there were few points of true interest in Syntactic Structures itself, and the eventual interpretations that the rules or structures are 'cognitive', innate, or biological would have been made elsewhere, especially in the context of a debate between Chomsky and the advocates of behaviourism. But decades later Chomsky makes the clear statement that syntactic structures, including the object as a dependent of the verb phrase, are caused by a genetic mutation in humans. =Chomsky as a young linguist= Noam Chomsky, the author of Syntactic Structures (1977 photo) Chomsky's interest in language started at an early age. When he was twelve, he studied Hebrew grammar under his father.Specifically, Chomsky read David Kimhi's Hebrew Grammar (Mikhlol) (1952), an annotated study of a 13th century Hebrew grammar. It was written by his father, William Chomsky, one of the leading Hebrew scholars at the time. See He also studied Arabic in his first year at the University of Pennsylvania.For its similarity to Hebrew. See and In 1947, he met Zellig Harris, the founder of the college's linguistics department. Harris was an established linguist. He did research in the way laid out by American linguist Leonard Bloomfield. He let Chomsky proofread a copy of his book Methods in Structural Linguistics (1951).In the 1947 preface of , Zellig Harris writes that ‚ÄúN. Chomsky has given much-needed assistance with the manuscript.\\" This is how Chomsky came to know a formal theory of linguistics. He soon decided to major in the subject.In his preface to , Chomsky writes that ‚ÄúMy introduction to the field of linguistics was in 1947, when Zellig Harris gave me the proofs of his 'Methods in Structural Linguistics' to read.\\" For his thesis, Chomsky set out to apply Harris's methods to Hebrew. Following Harris's advice, he studied logic, philosophy, and mathematics. and He found Harris's views on language much like Nelson Goodman's work on philosophical systems.Especially Goodman's work on constructional systems and on the inadequacy of inductive approaches. See . writes: \\"Chomsky has said that he was convinced from his days as a student of Goodman's that there is no inductive learning.\\" Chomsky was also influenced by the works of W. V. O. Quine writes: \\"Quine's critiques of logical empiricism also gave some reason to believe that [a non-taxonomic approach to linguistic theory] might be a plausible one.\\" and Rudolf Carnap. states that among non- American philosophers, it was only Rudolf Carnap whom Chomsky read as a student (p. 3) writes that \\"It is well known that Carnap's post-Aufbau work (especially Logische Syntax der Sprache) influenced Chomsky directly to some extent.\\" Quine showed that one cannot completely verify the meaning of a statement through observations. Carnap had developed a formal theory of language. It used symbols and rules that did not refer to meaning. From there on, Chomsky tried to build a grammar of Hebrew. Such a grammar would generate the phonetic or sound forms of sentences. To this end, he organized Harris's methods in a different way. states: \\"The most significant discontinuity [between Harris's Methods and Chomsky's Syntactic Structures] is Chomsky's inversion of Harris's analytic procedures.\\" To describe sentence forms and structures, he came up with a set of recursive rules. These are rules that refer back to themselves. He also found that there were many different ways of presenting the grammar. He tried to develop a method to measure how simple a grammar is. writes: \\"[Echoing] Goodman's pro-simplicity arguments ... the task of creating ... a simplicity measure is precisely the one Chomsky sets for himself in Chapter 4 of LSLT.\\" For this, he looked for \\"generalizations\\" among the possible sets of grammatical rules. states: \\"We want the reduction of the number of elements and statements, any generalizations ... to increase the total simplicity of the grammar\\" Chomsky completed his undergraduate thesis The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew in 1949. He then published a revised and expanded version of it as his master's thesis in 1951. In 1951, Chomsky became a Junior Fellow at Harvard University. There, he tried to build an all-formal linguistic theory.Before Chomsky, Israeli mathematician and linguist Yehoshua Bar-Hillel had already shown in that formal languages and methods used in symbolic logic can be adapted to analyze human languages. It was a clear break with the existing tradition of language study. In 1953, Chomsky published his first paper as a scholar. In it he tried to adapt the symbol-based language of logic to describe the syntax of a human language. During his fellowship, Chomsky organized all his ideas into a huge manuscript. It was around 1,000 typewritten pages long. He gave it the title The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (LSLT). In 1955, Chomsky found a job at MIT. He worked there as a linguist in the mechanical translation project. The same year he submitted his doctoral dissertation to the University of Pennsylvania. The university granted him a Ph.D. for his thesis Transformational Analysis. In fact, it was just the ninth chapter of LSLT. Publication In 1955, Chomsky had a doctorate in linguistics. Even so, he struggled at first to publish his theory and views on language. He offered the manuscript of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (LSLT) for publication. But MIT's Technology Press refused to publish it. He also saw a paper promptly rejected by the academic linguistics journal WORD.Chomsky writes in : \\"As for the reception accorded to LSLT [the Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory], there is little to say. I've already told you that I did not have the impression the reaction on the part of linguists was surprising. I offered LSLT to the MIT-Press ‚Äì who refused it. Quite rightly, I think, because at that time the situation was very unfavourable for a general book on that subject, especially one by an unknown author. I also submitted a technical article on simplicity and explanation to the journal Word, at the suggestion of Roman Jakobson, but it was rejected virtually by return mail. So I had little hope of seeing any of this work published, at least in a linguistic journal.\\" So he remained an outsider to the field of linguistics. His reviews and articles at the time were mostly published in non-linguistic journals.In particular, Chomsky wrote an academic paper in 1956 titled Three Models for the Description of Language published in the technological journal IRE Transactions on Information Theory (). It foreshadows many of the concepts presented in Syntactic Structures. Mouton & Co. was a Dutch publishing house based in The Hague. They had gained academic reputation by publishing works on Slavic Studies since 1954. Particularly, they had published works by linguists Nicolaas Van Wijk and Roman Jakobson. Soon they started a new series called Janua Linguarum or the \\"Gate of Languages.\\" It was intended to be a series of \\"small monographs\\" on general linguistics.The series's editor van Schooneveld is quoted thus in : \\"I had originally conceived of the Janua as a series of small monographs of the size of a large article, too interesting to get drowned in a periodical amongst other contributions and to be lost to oblivion by the current of time.\\" The first volume of the Janua Linguarum series was written by Roman Jakobson and Morris Halle. It was called Fundamentals of Language, published in 1956. Chomsky had already met Jakobson, a professor at Harvard University, during his fellowship years. Halle was Chomsky's graduate classmate at Harvard and then a close colleague at MIT. In 1956, Chomsky and Halle collaborated to write an article on phonology, published in a festschrift for Jakobson. The festschrift was published by Mouton in 1956. Cornelis van Schooneveld was the editor of the Janua Linguarum series at Mouton. He was a Dutch linguist and a direct student of Jakobson. He was looking for monographs to publish for his series. Consequently, he visited Chomsky at MIT in 1956. With Morris Halle's (and possibly Jakobson's) mediation, Chomsky showed van Schooneveld his notes for his introductory linguistics course for undergraduate students. Van Schooneveld took an interest in them. He offered to publish an elaborate version of them at Mouton, to which Chomsky agreed.Chomsky is quoted in saying: \\"It [Syntactic Structures] was course notes for an undergraduate course at MIT. Van Schooneveld [a Dutch linguist who was associated with Mouton] showed up here once and took a look at some of my course notes from the undergraduate course I was teaching and said I ought to publish it.\\" In (), Chomsky recounted: \\"At the time Mouton was publishing just about anything, so they decided they'd publish it along with a thousand other worthless things that were coming out. That's the story of Syntactic Structures: course notes for undergraduate science students published by accident in Europe.\\" The publication of Syntactic structures is also discussed in and . Chomsky then prepared a manuscript of the right size (no longer than 120 pages)According to , Peter de Ridder, the managing director of Mouton, wrote to van Schooneveld that \\"new titles in the series [should be] no bigger than about 120 pages.\\" that would fit the series. After revising an earlier manuscript, Chomsky sent a final version in the first week of August in 1956 to van Schooneveld. A scan of Chomsky's own typewritten letter dated 5 August 1956 to Mouton editor Cornelis van Schooneveld can be found in . This letter accompanied the final version of the manuscript. The editor had Chomsky rename the book's title to Syntactic Structures for commercial purposes. mentions De Ridder writing to van Schooneveld that \\"I am convinced that the book will sell well with this title.\\" The book was also pre-ordered in big numbers by MIT. These gave more incentives to Mouton to publish the book. Mouton finally published Chomsky's monograph titled Syntactic Structures in the second week of February 1957. Soon after the book's first publication, Bernard Bloch, editor of the prestigious journal Language, gave linguist Robert Benjamin Lees, a colleague of Chomsky's at MIT, the opportunity to write a review of the book. Lees's very positive remarks that Lees's review was \\"hyperbolic\\", his language \\"loaded\\" and refers to Lees as \\"Chomsky's Huxley\\", referring to the proselytizing \\"bulldog\\" role played by Thomas Henry Huxley in defense of Charles Darwin's theories on evolution. considers Lees to be \\"Chomsky's explicator\\". Chomsky himself considers Lees's review \\"provocative.\\" () essay- length review appeared in the July‚ÄìSeptember 1957 issue of Language. This early but influential review made Syntactic Structures visible on the linguistic research landscape. Shortly thereafter the book created a putative \\"revolution\\" in the discipline. remarked that \\"a revolution of the kind Kuhn describes has recently taken place in linguistics ‚Äì dating from the publication of Chomsky's Syntactic Structures in 1957\\". According to : \\"What has happened in linguistics since Chomsky appeared on the scene almost perfectly fits Kuhn's description of how a scientific revolution works.\\" Searle writes that \\"[Chomsky's] revolution followed fairly closely the general pattern described in Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\".

Three decades after his original review, wrote that \\"Judged by the objectives stated in the original manifestoes, the revolution has not succeeded. Something else may have succeeded, or may eventually succeed, but the goals of the original revolution have been altered and in a sense abandoned.\\" As for LSLT, it would be 17 more years before it saw publication. Syntactic Structures was the fourth book in the Janua Linguarum series. It was the series's bestselling book. It was reprinted 13 times until 1978. In 1962, a Russian translation by Konstantin Ivanovich Babisky, titled –°–∏–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏ÃÅ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—ÉÃÅ—Ä—ã (Sintaksychyeskiye Struktury), was published in Moscow. In 1963, Yasuo Isamu wrote a Japanese translation of the book, named ÊñáÊ≥ï„ÅÆÊßãÈÄ† (Bunp≈ç no k≈çz≈ç). In 1969, a French translation by Michel Braudeau, titled Structures Syntaxiques, was published by √âditions du Seuil in Paris. In 1973, Mouton published a German translation by Klaus-Peter Lange, titled Strukturen der Syntax. The book has also been translated into Korean, Spanish, Italian, Czech, Serbo-Croatian and Swedish languages. Contents =Goals of syntactic investigation= In Syntactic Structures, Chomsky tries to construct a \\"formalized theory of linguistic structure\\". He places emphasis on \\"rigorous formulations\\" and \\"precisely constructed models\\". In the first chapter of the book, he gives a definition of human language syntax. He then talks about the goals of syntactic study. For Chomsky, a linguist's goal is to build a grammar of a language. He defines grammar as a device which produces all the sentences of the language under study. Secondly, a linguist must find the abstract concepts beneath grammars to develop a general method. This method would help select the best possible device or grammar for any language given its corpus. Finally, a linguistic theory must give a satisfactory description of all the levels of language analysis. Examples of these levels include sounds, words and sentence structures. =Grammaticality= A tree diagram of the sentence \\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\\" The second chapter is titled \\"The Independence of Grammar\\". In it, Chomsky states that a language is \\"a set ... of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements\\". A linguist should separate the \\"grammatical sequences\\" or sentences of a language from the \\"ungrammatical sequences\\". By a \\"grammatical\\" sentence Chomsky means a sentence that is intuitively \\"acceptable to a native speaker\\". It is a sentence pronounced with a \\"normal sentence intonation\\". It is also \\"recall[ed] much more quickly\\" and \\"learn[ed] much more easily\\". Chomsky then analyzes further about the basis of \\"grammaticality.\\" He shows three ways that do not determine whether a sentence is grammatical or not. First, a grammatical sentence need not be included in a corpus. Secondly, it need not be meaningful. Finally, it does not have to be statistically probable. Chomsky shows all three points using a nonsensical sentence \\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.\\" He writes that the sentence is instinctively \\"grammatical\\" to a native English speaker. But it is not included in any known corpus at the time and is neither meaningful nor statistically probable. Chomsky concludes that \\"grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning.\\" He adds that \\"probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure.\\" Carnap's influence British linguist Marcus Tomalin stated that a version of \\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\\" was suggested decades earlier by Rudolf Carnap. This German philosopher offered in 1934 the pseudo-sentence \\"Piroten karulieren elatisch\\". According to American linguist Reese Heitner, Carnap's sentence showed the autonomy of both syntactic and phonological structures.According to : \\"[Carnap's sentence] actually does the double duty of demonstrating the \\"autonomy\\" of syntactic and phonological structure, an indication that not only can sentences be recognized as syntactically well-formed, but individual words can also be recognized as phonologically well-formed independent of semantics.\\" =Grammar models and transformations= In the third chapter titled \\"An Elementary Linguistic Theory\\", Chomsky tries to determine what sort of device or model gives an adequate account of a given set of \\"grammatical\\" sentences. Chomsky hypothesizes that this device has to be finite instead of infinite. He then considers finite state grammar, a communication theoretic modelSpecifically, the model proposed in which treats language as a Markov process. Then in the fourth chapter titled \\"Phrase Structure\\", he discusses phrase structure grammar, a model based on immediate constituent analysis. In the fifth chapter titled \\"Limitations of Phrase Structure Description\\", he claims to show that both these models are inadequate for the purpose of linguistic description. As a solution, he introduces transformational generative grammar (TGG), \\"a more powerful model ... that might remedy these inadequacies.\\" The grammar model discussed in Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures (1957) Chomsky's transformational grammar has three parts: phrase structure rules, transformational rules and morphophonemic rules. The phrase structure rules are used for expanding grammatical categories and for substitutions. These yield a string of morphemes. A transformational rule \\"operates on a given string ... with a given constituent structure and converts it into a new string with a new derived constituent structure.\\" It \\"may rearrange strings or may add or delete morphemes.\\" Transformational rules are of two kinds: obligatory or optional. Obligatory transformations applied on the \\"terminal strings\\" of the grammar produce the \\"kernel of the language\\". Kernel sentences are simple, active, declarative and affirmative sentences. To produce passive, negative, interrogative or complex sentences, one or more optional transformation rules must be applied in a particular order to the kernel sentences. At the final stage of the grammar, morphophonemic rules convert a string of words into a string of phonemes. Chomsky then applies this idea of transformational rules in the English auxiliary verb system. Borrowing of terminology In Syntactic Structures, the term \\"transformation\\" was borrowed from the works of Zellig Harris. Harris was Chomsky's initial mentor. Harris used the term \\"transformation\\" to describe equivalence relations between sentences of a language. By contrast, Chomsky's used the term to describe a formal rule applied to underlying structures of sentences. Chomsky also borrowed the term \\"generative\\" from a previous work of mathematician Emil Post.In , Chomsky writes that he was \\"following a familiar technical use of the term \\"generate,\\" cf. \\". In , Chomksy justifies his choice of the term \\"generate\\", writing that \\"the term 'generate' is familiar in the sense intended here in logic, particularly in Post's theory of combinatorial systems. Furthermore, 'generate' seems to be the most appropriate translation for Humboldt's term erzeugen, which he frequently uses, it seems, in essentially the sense here intended. Since this use of the term 'generate' is well established both in logic and in the tradition of linguistic theory.\\" Post wanted to \\"mechanically [derive] inferences from an initial axiomatic sentence\\"., and Chomsky applied Post's work on logical inference to describe sets of strings (sequence of letters or sounds) of a human language. When he says a finite set of rules \\"generate\\" (i.e. \\"recursively enumerate\\") the set of potentially infinite number of sentences of a particular human language, he means that they provide an explicit, structural description of those sentences.In , Chomsky writes that \\"by a generative grammar I mean simply a system of rules that in some explicit and well-defined way assigns structural descriptions to sentences.\\" =Justification of grammars= In the sixth chapter titled \\"On the Goals of Linguistic Theory\\", Chomsky writes that his \\"fundamental concern\\" is \\"the problem of justification of grammars\\". He draws parallels between the theory of language and theories in physical sciences. He compares a finite corpus of utterances of a particular language to \\"observations\\". He likens grammatical rules to \\"laws\\" which are stated in terms of \\"hypothetical constructs\\" such as phonemes, phrases, etc. According to Chomsky, the criteria for the \\"justification of grammars\\" are \\"external conditions of adequacy\\", the \\"condition of generality\\" and \\"simplicity\\". To choose the best possible grammar for a given corpus of a given language, Chomsky shows his preference for the \\"evaluation procedure\\" (which uses the aforementioned criteria). He rejects the \\"discovery procedure\\" writes: \\"Our main point is that a linguistic theory should not be identified with a manual of useful procedures, nor should it be expected to provide mechanical procedures for the discovery of grammars\\" (employed in structural linguistics and supposed to automatically and mechanically produce the correct grammar of a language from a corpus notes that \\"the fullest and most interesting expression of 'discovery procedure' is [the] book Methods in Structural Linguistics () by Zellig Harris, Chomsky's mentor.). He also dismisses the \\"decision procedure\\" (supposed to automatically choose the best grammar for a language from a set of competing grammars). Chomsky thus shows preference for \\"explanatory depth\\" with some \\"empirical inadequacies\\" over the pursuit of very detailed empirical coverage of all data.See . Chomsky characterized this approach as the \\"Galilean Style\\" of inquiry which had already been applied in modern natural sciences with \\"great success\\" since the 17th century. =Application of transformational grammar in English= In the seventh chapter titled \\"Some Transformations in English\\", Chomsky strictly applies his just-proposed transformation-based approach on some aspects of English. He treats at length the formation of English negative passive sentences, yes-no and wh- interrogative sentences, etc. He claims in the end that transformational analysis can describe \\"a wide variety of ... distinct phenomena\\" in English grammar in a \\"simple\\", \\"natural\\" and \\"orderly\\" way. states:\\"a wide variety of apparently distinct phenomena [in English language] all fall into place in a very simple and natural way when we adopt the viewpoint of transformational analysis and that, consequently, the grammar of English becomes much more simple and orderly.\\" =Constructional homonymity and distinct levels of linguistic analysis= In the eighth chapter titled \\"The explanatory power of linguistic theory\\", Chomsky writes a linguistic theory cannot content itself by just generating valid grammatical sentences. It also has to account for other structural phenomena at different levels of linguistic representation. At a certain linguistic level, there can be two items which can be understood having different meanings but they are structurally indistinguishable within that level. This is called a ‚Äúconstructional homonymity‚Äù [sic]. The relevant ambiguity can be resolved by establishing a higher level of linguistic analysis. At this higher level, the two items can be clearly shown having two different structural interpretations. In this way, constructional homonymities at the phonemic level can be resolved by establishing the level of morphology, and so forth. One of the motivation of establishing a distinct, higher level of linguistic analysis is, then, to explain the structural ambiguity due to the constructional homonymities at a lower level. On the other hand, each linguistic level also captures some structural similarities within the level that are not explained in lower levels. Chomsky uses this argument as well to motivate the establishment of distinct levels of linguistic analysis. Chomsky then shows that a grammar which analyzes sentences up to the phrase structure level contains many constructional homonymities at the phrase structure level where the resulting ambiguities need to be explained at a higher level. Then he shows how his newly invented ‚Äútransformational level‚Äù can naturally and successfully function as that higher level. He further claims that any phrase structure grammar which cannot explain these ambiguities as successfully as transformational grammar does must be considered \\"inadequate\\". =Role of semantics in syntax= In the ninth chapter titled \\"Syntax and Semantics\\", Chomsky reminds that his analysis so far has been \\"completely formal and non- semantic.\\" He then offers many counterexamples to refute some common linguistic assertions about grammar's reliance on meaning. He concludes that the correspondence between meaning and grammatical form is \\"imperfect\\", \\"inexact\\" and \\"vague.\\" Consequently, it is \\"relatively useless\\" to use meaning \\"as a basis for grammatical description\\". To support his point, Chomsky considers a similar relation between semantics and phonology. He shows that in order to build a theory of phonemic distinction based on meaning would entail \\"complex\\", \\"exhaustive\\" and \\"laborious investigation\\" of an \\"immense\\", \\"vast corpus\\". By contrast, phonemic distinctness can be easily explained in a \\"straightforward\\" way and in \\"completely non-semantic terms\\" with the help of \\"pair tests\\". Chomsky also claims that a strictly formal, non-semantic framework of syntactic theory might ultimately be useful to support a parallel independent semantic theory.Because it would \\"reveal\\" insights about sentence structures. See Rhetorical style Randy Allen Harris, a specialist of the rhetoric of science, writes that Syntactic Structures \\"appeals calmly and insistently to a new conception\\" of linguistic science. He finds the book \\"lucid, convincing, syntactically daring, the calm voice of reason ... [speaking] directly to the imagination and ambition of the entire field.\\" It also bridged the \\"rhetorical gulf\\" to make the message of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (a highly abstract, mathematically dense, and \\"forbiddingly technical\\" work) more palatable to the wider field of linguists. In a more detailed examination of the book, Harris finds Chomsky's argumentation in Syntactic Structures \\"multilayered and compelling\\". Chomsky not only makes a logical appeal (i.e. logos) to a highly formalized model of language, but also appeals explicitly and tacitly to the ethos of science. In particular, Chomsky‚Äôs analysis of the complex English auxiliary verb system in Syntactic Structures had great rhetorical effect. It combined simple phrase structure rules with a simple transformational rule. This treatment was based entirely on formal simplicity. Various linguists have described it as ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù, ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù, ‚Äúelegant‚Äù, ‚Äúrevealing‚Äù, ‚Äúinsightful‚Äù, ‚Äúbeguiling‚Äù and ‚Äúingenious‚Äù. wrote that ‚Äú[Chomsky‚Äôs] examples of defects of phrase structure grammar were illustrated simultaneously with the demonstration that grammars containing the more powerful transformational rules can handle the same phenomena in an elegant and revealing manner.‚ÄùAccording to , \\"this apparently curious analysis is rather ingenious\\" and \\"the powerful tool of different levels of structure related by transformations was particularly beguiling, since transformations appeared to offer a means of explaining the often amazingly complex relationships between the forms of sentences and their understanding.\\"In his introduction to Syntactic Structures (), American linguist David Lightfoot wrote that \\"this ingenious transformation...avoided hopelessly complex phrase structure rules and yielded an elegant account... ‚Äù According to American linguist Frederick Newmeyer, this particular analysis won many ‚Äúsupporters for Chomsky‚Äù and ‚Äúimmediately led to some linguists‚Äô proposing generative-transformational analysis of particular phenomena‚Äù. According to British linguist E. Keith Brown, \\"the elegance and insightfulness of this account was instantly recognized, and this was an important factor in ensuring the initial success of the transformational way of looking at syntax.\\" American linguist Mark Aronoff wrote that this ‚Äúbeautiful analysis and description of some very striking facts was the rhetorical weapon that drove the acceptance of [Chomsky‚Äôs] theory‚Äù. He added that in Chomsky‚Äôs treatment of English verbs, ‚Äúthe convergence of theory and analysis provide a description of facts so convincing that it changed the entire field‚Äù. Raymond Oenbring, a doctorate in the rhetoric of science, thinks that Chomsky \\"overstates the novelty\\" of transformational rules. He \\"seems to take all the credit for them\\" even though a version of them had already been introduced by Zellig Harris in a previous work. He writes that Chomsky himself was \\"cautious\\" to \\"display deference\\" to prevailing linguistic research. His enthusiastic followers such as Lees were, by contrast, much more \\"confrontational\\". They sought to drive a \\"rhetorical wedge\\" between Chomsky's work and that of post-Bloomfieldians (i.e. American linguists in the 1940s et 1950s), arguing that the latter does not qualify as linguistic \\"science\\". Reception =Impact on linguistics= In an early review of the book, American structural linguist Charles F. Voegelin wrote that Syntactic Structures posed a fundamental challenge to the established way of doing linguistic research. He stated that it had the potential to accomplish \\"a Copernican revolution\\" within linguistics. Another American linguist Martin Joos called the Chomskyan brand of linguistic theory a \\"heresy\\" within the Bloomfieldian tradition. These early remarks proved to be prescient. American linguist Paul Postal commented in 1964 that most of the \\"syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States\\" were \\"versions of the theory of phrase structure grammars in the sense of Chomsky\\". By 1965, linguists were saying that Syntactic Structures had \\"mark[ed] an epoch\\", had a \\"startling impact\\" and created a Kuhnian \\"revolution\\". British linguist John Lyons wrote in 1966 that \\"no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's Syntactic Structures.\\" British historian of linguistics R. H. Robins wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's Syntactic Structures was \\"probably the most radical and important change in direction in descriptive linguistics and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years\\". Another historian of linguistics Frederick Newmeyer considers Syntactic Structures \\"revolutionary\\" for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a formal yet non-empiricist theory of language was possible. Chomsky demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of English grammar. Secondly, it put syntax at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. Subsequently, morphology (i.e. the study of structure and formation of words) and phonology (i.e. the study of organization of sounds in languages) were relegated in importance. American linguist Norbert Hornstein wrote that before Syntactic Structures, linguistic research was overly preoccupied with creating hierarchies and categories of all observable language data. One of the \\"lasting contributions\\" of Syntactic Structures is that it shifted the linguistic research methodology to abstract, rationalist theory-making based on contacts with data, which is the \\"common scientific practice\\". =Impact on other disciplines= ;Psychology The generative grammar of Syntactic Structures heralded Chomsky's mentalist perspective in linguistic analysis. Shortly after its publication, in 1959, Chomsky wrote a critical review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior. Skinner had presented the acquisition of human language in terms of conditioned responses to outside stimuli and reinforcement. Chomsky opposed this behaviorist model. He argued that humans produce language using separate syntactic and semantic components inside the mind. He presented the generative grammar as a coherent abstract description of this underlying psycholinguistic reality. Chomsky's argument had a forceful impact on psycholinguistic research. It changed the course of the discipline in the following years.According to : \\"[Chomsky's generative system of rules] was more powerful that anything ... psycholinguists had heretofore had at their disposal. [It] was of special interest to these theorists. Many psychologists were quick to attribute generative systems to the minds of speakers and quick to abandon ... Behaviorism.\\" ;Philosophy Syntactic Structures initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between philosophers of language and linguists. American philosopher John Searle called it a \\"remarkable intellectual achievement\\" of its time. He compared the book \\"to the work of Keynes or Freud\\". He credited it with producing not only a \\"revolution in linguistics\\", but also having a \\"revolutionary effect\\" on \\"philosophy and psychology\\". Chomsky and Willard Van Orman Quine, a stridently anti-mentalistic philosopher of language, debated many times on the merit of Chomsky's linguistic theories. Many philosophers supported Chomsky's idea that natural languages are innate and syntactically rule-governed. They also believed in the existence of rules in the human mind which bind meanings to utterances. The investigation of these rules started a new era in philosophical semantics. writes: \\"That natural languages are indeed not systematic enough to allow formal treatment ... is ... a complaint that has been leveled against natural languages by philosophers for centuries. The work of Chomsky in generative linguistics apparently inspired much more confidence in philosophers and logicians to assert that perhaps natural languages weren't as unsystematic and misleading as their philosophical predecessors had made them out to be ... at the end of 1960s formal semantics began to flourish.\\" writes: \\"Recent work by Chomsky and others is doing much to bring the complexities of natural languages within the scope of serious semantic theory\\". ;Computer science With its formal and logical treatment of language, Syntactic Structures also brought linguistics and the new field of computer science closer together. Computer scientist Donald Knuth (winner of the Turing Award) recounted that he read Syntactic Structures in 1961 and was influenced by it.From the preface of : \\"... researchers in linguistics were beginning to formulate rules of grammar that were considerably more mathematical than before. And people began to realize that such methods are highly relevant to the artificial languages that were becoming popular for computer programming, even though natural languages like English remained intractable. I found the mathematical approach to grammar immediately appealing‚Äîso much so, in fact, that I must admit to taking a copy of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures along with me on my honeymoon in 1961. During odd moments, while crossing the Atlantic in an ocean liner and while camping in Europe, I read that book rather thoroughly and tried to answer some basic theoretical questions. Here was a marvelous thing: a mathematical theory of language in which I could use a computer programmer's intuition! The mathematical, linguistic, and algorithmic parts of my life had previously been totally separate. During the ensuing years those three aspects became steadily more intertwined; and by the end of the 1960s I found myself a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, primarily because of work that I had done with respect to languages for computer programming.\\" Chomsky's \\"Three models\\" paper (), published a year prior to the Syntactic Structures and containing many of its ideas, was crucial to the development of the theory of formal languages within computer science. writes:\\"[Papers like the \\"Three Models\\"] had a huge, lasting influence on pure computer science\\" and that they are cited in \\"virtually every introduction to compiler design\\". states that \\"Chomsky's notion of a context-free grammar ... has aided immensely the specification of programming languages.\\" ;Neuroscience In 2011, a group of French neuroscientists conducted research to verify if actual brain mechanisms worked in the way that Chomsky suggested in Syntactic Structures. The results suggested that specific regions of the brain handle syntactic information in an abstract way. These are independent from other brain regions that handle semantic information. Moreover, the brain analyzes not just mere strings of words, but hierarchical structures of constituents. These observations validated the theoretical claims of Chomsky in Syntactic Structures. In 2015, neuroscientists at New York University conducted experiments to verify if the human brain uses \\"hierarchical structure building\\" for processing languages. They measured the magnetic and electric activities in the brains of participants. The results showed that \\"[human] brains distinctly tracked three components of the phrases they heard.\\" This \\"[reflected] a hierarchy in our neural processing of linguistic structures: words, phrases, and then sentences‚Äîat the same time.\\" These results bore out Chomsky's hypothesis in Syntactic Structures of an \\"internal grammar mechanism\\" inside the brain. Criticisms ;Erroneous idealization In his 1964 presidential address to the Linguistic Society of America, American linguist Charles Hockett considered Syntactic Structures one of \\"only four major breakthroughs in modern linguistics\\".The other three are Sir William Jones's address to the Asiatic Society in 1786, Karl Verner's Eine Ausnahme der ersten Lautverschiebung in 1875 and Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de Linguistique G√©n√©rale in 1916. But he rapidly turned into a fierce critic of Chomskyan linguistics. By 1966, Hockett rejected \\"[Chomsky's] frame of reference in almost every detail\\". In his 1968 book The State of the Art, Hockett writes that Chomsky's main fallacy is that he treats language as a formal, well-defined, stable system and proceeds from this idealized abstraction. Hockett believes such an idealization is not possible. He claims that there is no empirical evidence that our language faculty is, in reality, a well-defined underlying system. The sources that give rise to language faculty in humans, e.g. physical genetic transmission and cultural transmission, are themselves poorly defined. states: \\"we must not promote our more or less standardized by-and-large characterization of the language to the status of a monolithic ideal, nor infer that because we can achieve a fixed characterization some such monolithic ideal exists, in the lap of God or in the brain of each individual speaker.\\" Hockett also opposed Chomsky's hypothesis that syntax is completely independent of the study of meaning. ;Non-empiricism Contrary to Hockett, British linguist Geoffrey Sampson thought that Chomsky's assumptions about a well-defined grammaticality are \\"[justified] in practice.\\" It brought syntax \\"within the purview of scientific description\\". He considers it a \\"great positive contribution to the discipline\\". However, he maintains that Chomsky's linguistics is overly \\"intuition-based\\". For him, it relies too much on native speakers' subjective introspective judgments about their own language. Consequently, language data empirically observed by impersonal third parties are given less importance., and ;Influence of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory According to Sampson, Syntactic Structures largely owes its good fortune of becoming the dominant theoretical paradigm in the following years to the charisma of Chomsky's intellect. Sampson writes that there are many references in Syntactic Structures to Chomsky's own The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (LSLT) in matters regarding the formal underpinnings of Chomsky's approach, but LSLT was not widely available in print for decades. Nevertheless, Sampson's argument runs, Syntactic Structures, albeit \\"sketchy\\", derived its \\"aura of respectability\\" from LSLT lurking in the background. In turn, the acceptance of Chomsky's future works rested on the success of Syntactic Structures. In the view of British-American linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum, Syntactic Structures boldly claims that \\"it is impossible, not just difficult\\" for finite-state devices to generate all grammatical sentences of English, and then alludes to LSLT for the \\"rigorous proof\\" of this. But in reality, LSLT does not contain a valid, convincing proof dismissing finite- state devices. ;Originality Pullum also remarks that the \\"originality\\" of Syntactic Structures is \\"highly overstated\\". For him, it \\"does not properly credit the earlier literature on which it draws\\". He shows in detail how the approach in Syntactic Structures goes directly back to the work of the mathematical logician Emil Post on formalizing proof. But \\"few linguists are aware of this, because Post's papers are not cited.\\" Pullum adds that the use of formal axiomatic systems to generate probable sentences in language in a top-down manner was first proposed by Zellig Harris in 1947, ten years before the publication of Syntactic Structures. This is downplayed in Syntactic Structures. ;Necessity of transformations In 1982, Pullum and another British linguist Gerald Gazdar argued that Chomsky's criticisms of context-free phrase structure grammar in Syntactic Structures are either mathematically flawed or based on incorrect assessments of the empirical data. They stated that a purely phrase structure treatment of grammar can explain linguistic phenomena better than one that uses transformations.Versions of such non- transformational phrase structure grammars include Generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG), Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) and Lexical functional grammar (LFG).

He also played an important role during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Biography He was born on 20 May 1795 in San Mateo de Huichapan, a town located in the modern-day state of Hidalgo. His parents were Pedro Jos√© Anaya y Maldonado and Mar√≠a Antonia de √Ålvarez, both Spaniards. He started his military career in the Royal Army in 1810, as a cadet in the company of Tres Villas. In June 1821 he joined the rebel army fighting for independence. In 1847, after the victory of the invading U.S. Army in the Battle of Padierna (also known as the Battle of Contreras), the Mexican battalions of Independencia and Bravo were attacked in the convent of Santa Mar√≠a de Churubusco. This confrontation is known as the Battle of Churubusco, and the Mexican army was bravely commanded by Pedro Mar√≠a Anaya. When General Anaya was asked by General Twiggs to surrender his ammunition after the end of the battle, he replied, \\"If I had any ammunition, you would not be here\\". The battle was important not only because the American victory made it possible for them to win the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but also because of the historical participation of the Saint Patrick's Battalion. Today the nearest metro station from the Santa Mar√≠a de Churubusco convent in Mexico City is called \\"Metro General Anaya\\".

For instance, members of the Grand Council were called Coohai nash≈´n-i amban (50px) in Manchu and Qing governor- generals were called Uheri kadalara amban (60px). The word amban was transcribed into Chinese as (). By far the most known ambans were the Qing imperial residents (Manchurian: 60px Serem≈°eme tehe amban; ; Tibetan: Ngang pai) in Tibet, Qinghai, Mongolia and Xinjiang, which recognized Qing authority, but were not governed as regular provinces and retained many of their existing institutions. The Qing imperial residents can be roughly compared to a European resident (also known as resident commissioners) in a protectorate (e.g. a British Indian princely state), the real rapport depending on historical circumstances rather than a general job description for every amban, while his authority often was very extensive, rather like a provincial governor.  Tibet  The Qing Emperor appointed an amban in Tibet (), who represented Qing authority over the Buddhist theocracy of Tibet, and commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in Lhasa. The chief amban was aided by an assistant amban () and both of them reported to the Qing Lifan Yuan. Their duties included acting as intermediary between China and the Hindu kingdom of Nepal (Ghorkhas Country); a secretary () dealt with native affairs. Three Chinese commissioners (), of the class of sub-prefects, were stationed at Lhasa, Tashilumbo and Ngari. The Qing imperial resident in Tibet was introduced in 1727 and most ambasa were appointed from the Manchu Eight Banners, a few were Han Chinese or Mongol. The Emperors used ambasa to supervise Tibetan politics, and the Qianlong, Jiaqing and Daoguang Emperors each decreed that the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama were bound to follow the leadership or guidance of the ambasa in carrying out the administration of Tibet. Zhao Erfeng, a Han Chinese Bannerman, was appointed as the last Amban of Tibet by the Qing government. He was killed during the Xinhai Revolution by Chinese Republican Revolutionary forces intent on overthrowing the Qing dynasty. After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Manchu Amban Lien Yu and his Chinese soldiers were expelled from Lhasa. Xinjiang =Dzungaria= =Altishahr= Altishahr, meaning six cities, consisted of Uyghur cities of Yarkand, Kashgar, Khotan, Kuche, Aksu, and Yangi Hisar (or Ush-Turfan). The Qing dynasty's wars with the Zunghar Khanate pushed them into the area and by 1759 they had obtained control of this region. After the rebellion of Yakub Beg, Altishahr was incorporated into the administration of Xinjiang, which became a formal province in the Qing empire in 1884. Between 1761 and 1865, the Qing Empire appointed an imperial resident (Manchu: 35px hebei amban; Chinese: z«íngl«ê hu√≠jiƒÅng sh√¨w√π cƒÅnz√†n d√†ch√©n ) to Altishahr, which today forms part of southern Xinjiang.

Urga  Ambans of Zergoocha Yamen in Maimachin In the holy city of Urga, an amban (Mongol: 60px –•“Ø—Ä—ç—ç–Ω–∏–π –∞–º–±–∞–Ω –Ω–æ—ë–Ω, Chinese: K√πl√∫n b√†nsh√¨ d√†ch√©n) was stationed in order to assert Qing control over the Mongol dependencies. He controlled all temporal matters, and was specially charged with the control of the frontier town of Kiakhta and the trade conducted there with the Russians. Urga was also the residence of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, who was the spiritual head of the Mongol Khalkha tribes. The Khutuktu ranked third in degree of veneration among the dignitaries in the Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama. He resided in a sacred quarter on the western side of the town and acted as a spiritual counterpart of the Qing amban. After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Manchu amban was expelled by Mongol forces, fleeing to China proper via Russia.

The facility is currently being decommissioned and is transitioning to a SAFSTOR condition. The power plant was completed and licensed to operate in December 1976, and operated safely for 33 years until shutdown in September 2009. It was the third plant built as part of the Crystal River Energy Complex (CREC) which contains a single nuclear power plant, while sharing the site with four operational fossil fuel power plants. The Crystal River reactor went offline in September 2009 for refueling, OTSG replacement (once through steam generator), and 20% power up-rate outage. In preparing the containment building for making the opening to replace the two OTSG's, tendons in the containment building wall were detensioned. During the concrete removal in creating the opening workers discovered a large gap in the concrete of the containment building wall. The main cause of the gap, which further engineering analysis determined was a large delamination, was attributed to the scope and sequence of the tendon detensioning. The plant had originally been scheduled to restart in April 2011, but the project encountered a number of delays. Repairs were successful, but additional delamination began to occur in adjacent bays. After several months of analyzing options, Duke Energy senior executives announced in February 2013 that the Crystal River Nuclear Plant would be permanently shut down. The coal- fired units are not affected. Crystal River was originally owned by Florida Progress Corporation (and operated by its subsidiary, Florida Power Corporation) but, in 2000, it was bought by Carolina Power & Light to form the new company, Progress Energy. Progress Energy owned 91.8% of the plant; the remainder is owned by nine municipal utilities. Effective July 2, 2012 Duke Energy purchased Progress Energy and made it a wholly owned direct unit of Duke Energy. Power plant and containment Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant was an operating 860 MWe, PWR (pressurized water reactor plant). There are three main barriers that protect the public from the radiation hazards associated with nuclear operations. One of those barriers is known as the containment building which houses the fuel, the reactor, and the reactor cooling system. The Crystal River containment building is a steel lined post- tensioned (see: Prestressed concrete) cylindrical concrete structure approximately in height with an outside diameter of about . The containment has 42-inch thick concrete walls, has a flat foundation mat and a shallow torispherical dome. Post-tensioning is achieved by utilizing an outer array of horizontal tendons immediately adjacent to an inner array of vertical tendons that are embedded in the walls about 15 inches from the outside surface.  Refueling outage, containment repairs and closure  CR-3 went offline in September 2009 for RFO-16. While the reactor was down, the old steam generators were to be replaced. There are 426 steel tendons within the concrete walls of the reactor containment dome which reinforce the dome. Plan developer Sargent & Lundy specified that 97 tendons be loosened. Progress rejected that number as excessive. The next proposal was to loosen 74 tendons, which was typical of other nuclear plants doing the procedure. According to a Progress employee, \\"de-tensioning the tendons is a very expensive and time- consuming effort\\", so the number was further reduced to 65. Progress engaged Bechtel to provide a 3rd party review, which agreed that 65 was appropriate. However, when the work was performed, only 27 tendons were loosened, and a foreman and supervisor sent emails questioning the way the tendons were loosened. When workers began to cut the access hole for the steam generators, a crack formed. That crack was repaired, but more cracks appeared. Engineers noticed that parts of the concrete had delaminated. This was repaired, and the concrete re-tensioned, but the same problem was found in other areas. The plant had originally been due to restart in April 2011 following the uprate, but in June 2011 Progress Energy said that it did not expect it to restart until 2014. Preliminary cost estimates for the repairs was put at between $900 million and $1.3 billion, but this estimate was later called into question by Duke Energy. In October 2012 an independent review estimated the repair cost at $1.5 billion, with a worst-case scenario of $3.4 billion. In February 2013 Duke Energy announced that Crystal River would be permanently shut down and that they will recover $850 million in insurance claims. A Duke spokesperson stated, \\"The company sought input from numerous engineering experts ‚Äî internally and externally ‚Äî and used proven industry-accepted practices when determining how to replace the steam generators. Analysis has shown that the 2009 delamination (cracking) could not have been predicted. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed these findings.\\" Gregory Jaczko, former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, stated, \\"That's a multi-billion dollar asset that had to be shut down because of improper work planning, improper understanding of how to properly do this containment retrofit\\". Surrounding population The NRC defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. The 2010 U.S. population within of Crystal River was 20,695, an increase of 50.9 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,046,741, an increase of 32.4 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Ocala, ( to city center) and Spring Hill ( to city center). Seismic risk In September 10, 2006 a magnitude 5.8 earthquake occurred 300 miles southwest of the nuclear plant, no damage occurred to the Crystal River Nuclear Power Plant from the rare quake. The odds of such a quake happening again in the near-term around Florida are low. The NRC's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Crystal River was 1 in 45,455, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.

He served as a consultant on several computer games, and was on the management team of the 42 Entertainment experiential marketing and entertainment company, where he was lead writer for Haunted Apiary aka ilovebees and Last Call Poker. His novel series Cathy's Book (and its sequels) seems to represent the melding of his two careers, as it crosses the alternate reality game format with a teen novel. In 2007, he and several 4orty2wo co-founders left that company to start Fourth Wall Studios, where they won an Emmy for interactive television in 2013. In 2014, he joined Microsoft's Xbox Studios as Creative Director. After Xbox Studios closed in late 2014, Stewart began consulting for Magic Leap, joining them as Creative Director/Design Director in early 2016.https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-stewart-3332b14b/ Bibliography * Passion Play (1992, science fiction novel, winner of the Prix Aurora and Arthur Ellis Awards) * Nobody's Son (1994, fantasy novel, winner of the Aurora Award) * Resurrection Man (1995, magic realist fantasy novel, New York Times Best Science Fiction Book of the Year) * Clouds End (1996, heroic fantasy novel) * The Night Watch (1997, set in the same world as Resurrection Man) * Mockingbird (1998, New York Times Notable Book of the Year, World Fantasy Award nominee, Speculations Readers' Poll Best Book of the Year) * Galveston (2000, World Fantasy Award and Sunburst Award winner, again set in the same world as Resurrection Man) * Perfect Circle (2004, another magic realist fantasy novel; Nebula nominee; also published under the title Firecracker) * Yoda: Dark Rendezvous (Star Wars: A Clone Wars Novel) (2004) * Cathy's Book (2006) *Cathy's Key (2008) *Cathy's Ring (2009) References External links  42 Entertainment, Sean Stewart's former job * Fourth Wall Studios, co-founded by Stewart * 1999 interview by Locus (locusmag.com) * 2005 interview by Locus * 2006 interview on alternate reality gaming at Encyclopedia Hanasiana (hanasiana.com) * Discussion of Stewart at theforce.net * 2016 article/interview of Sean Stewart on aescifi.ca * 20th-century American novelists 21st-century American novelists American emigrants to Canada American fantasy writers American male novelists American science fiction writers Canadian fantasy writers Canadian science fiction writers World Fantasy Award-winning writers People from Davis, California People from Irvine, California People from Lubbock, Texas 1965 births Living people 20th-century Canadian male writers 21st-century Canadian male writers Novelists from California Writers from Edmonton ","title":"Sean Stewart"},{"id":"1790756","text":"Grischa (alternatively spelled Grisha or Gricha) is a short form for the name Gregory or Grigorij, and sometimes for the name Georgi as well, used in Russia and some other Slavic countries, including Ukraine and Bulgaria.

He was also a member of the executive triumvirate of the Second Mexican Empire that invited Maximilian of Habsburg to take the throne. Biography =Early years= Salas entered the military in 1813 as an infantry cadet in the Regimiento de Infantes de Puebla, a Spanish royalist regiment. His first actions were against the insurgents in the Mexican War of Independence. He was with Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna at the capture of Xalapa, Veracruz. In 1821 he accepted the Plan de Iguala for Mexican independence. He was a defender of the government of President Guadalupe Victoria at the time of the revolt of Plan de Monta√±o in 1827. He fought in Tampico against the invasion of the Spaniard Isidro Barradas in 1829. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1832. He commanded one of the columns in the assault on the Alamo, and fought in the action at Llano Perdido. He covered the retreat of the Mexican forces to Matamoros. On 15 July 1840, he took part the suppression of a revolt by soldiers at the National Palace. In 1844, he was exiled for his support of Santa Anna. =As president= On 4 August 1846 from the Ciudadela in Mexico City, he revolted against General Mariano Paredes, who had just temporarily turned over the presidency to Nicol√°s Bravo to take the field against other rebels. Salas proclaimed the reestablishment of the federalist r√©gime. (Paredes was a centralist.) Salas was president from 5 August 1846 to 23 December 1846. He immediately re-established the federalist Constitution of 1824 and convoked a new Congress. He worked hard to enlarge the militia and raise money for the upcoming war with the United States. In December he turned over power to Santa Anna (as president) and Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as (as vice- president and acting president). In 1847, Salas was promoted to general of division. As second in command of the Ej√©rcito del Norte (Northern Army), he fought the Americans in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Contreras (Padierna) on 20 August 1847. After the peace treaty, he was named military commander and governor of Quer√©taro. =The War of the Reform and the Second Empire= He served a second term as acting president during the War of the Reform, from 21 January 1859 to 2 February 1859, while awaiting the return of Miguel Miram√≥n. Miram√≥n (and Salas as his substitute) claimed the presidency for the Conservative cause. As commander of the garrison of Mexico City, on 1 June 1863 he formed part of the Executive Power of the Conservative government in the War of the Reform. This lasted until 21 June 1863, when the Regency of the Second Mexican Empire was formed. Together with General Juan Nepomuceno Almonte and Archbishop Antonio de LabastidaJuan Bautista Ormaechea replaced Labastida on the council after the latter was removed on 17 November 1863. he formed the triumvirate that exercised power during the Regency, under the protection of French arms (21 June 1863 to 12 June 1864). It was the Regency that sent representatives to Maximilian of Habsburg to offer him the imperial throne of Mexico. Maximilian assumed the throne on 12 June 1864. However, Benito Ju√°rez remained as constitutional president throughout this period, and throughout the Empire.

Built on the site of the original Redmond Hall, it is said by locals to have been haunted by the devil and the ghost of a young woman. After being purchased by Aidan Quigley in 2011, Loftus Hall was marketed as a haunted house which hosted guided tours of the house until 2020, when it was put on the market for sale. Redmond Hall In 1170, Raymond Le Gros landed at what is now known as Baginbun called so after his two ships La Bague et La Bonne, where he was to fight an important battle to safeguard the arrival of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, to Ireland. This area is a famous site in Irish history, known as the place ‚Äúwhere Ireland was lost and won‚Äù. He acquired land in the area in County Wexford, upon which he built a castle known as Houseland Castle. The Redmond family replaced their original castle with another in about 1350, during the time of the Black Death. This second castle was also known as The Hall or Redmond Hall.  Attack during the Irish Confederate Wars  In 1642, the future Loftus Hall ‚Äì then still known as Redmond's Hall ‚Äì was attacked by English soldiers loyal to Charles I of England. The Irish Confederate Wars had broken out in 1641 and hostilities commenced in Wexford in 1643. An English garrison of around 100 men under the command of Lord Esmonde was based at Duncannon Fort on Waterford Harbour. On 23 February, this garrison was reinforced by a further 200 soldiers under the command of Captain Anthony Weldon and Captain Thomas Aston along with six cannons. On 19 June a party of these soldiers from the fort were attacked by a group of Irish Confederates under the command of Captain Rossiter and Major James Butler at Shielbaggan while on their way to Tintern. The English were routed and driven back to the fort. Redmond's Hall was clearly visible to the beleaguered garrison at Duncannon. The Hall's owner, Alexander Redmond, was known to be sympathetic to the rebels. The Hall was known as a place that gave assistance to the rebels. Captain Aston believed it could be easily taken and on 20 July 1642 took ship from Duncannon with around ninety men and two small cannon, landing near the Hall. Although he was sixty-eight years old, Alexander Redmond barricaded the Hall and prepared to defend it. He was assisted by his sons, Robert and Michael, some of their tenants, two men at arms and an itinerant tailor who happened to be at work in the Hall when the attack took place. The defenders numbered ten in all and were armed with long barrelled fowling pieces. Captain Aston drew his men up in front of the Hall and demanded admission in the name of the King. Alexander Redmond retorted that Aston was welcome to come in provided only that he left his soldiers and weapons outside. A lengthy gun battle ensued. Aston discovered that his cannon were too small to make much impression on the main door. To add to his troubles about half his men abandoned him to pillage the countryside. As the fight dragged on a heavy sea-mist descended on the Hook Peninsula. Meanwhile, the Irish Confederates under Captain Rossiter and Captain Thomas Roche were still encamped at Shielbaggan. Hearing of the attack they marched rapidly to the aid of the defenders and surprised the attackers under cover of the fog. About thirty of the English escaped to their boats and back to the fort. Captain Aston himself was one of those killed. Many of the others, including Lord Esmonde's two nephews Lieutenants John and Walter Esmonde were taken prisoner. Several of the English prisoners were hanged the following day on Thomas Roche's orders, probably at Ballyhack. On 20 August eleven others were hanged at New Ross including one of the Esmonde brothers (see also, Siege of Duncannon).  Dispossession and change of ownership  The official Redmond family pedigree (registered in the Ulster Office, Dublin Castle 1763) alleges that Alexander Redmond had to defend the Hall one or even two more times against soldiers of Oliver Cromwell in the autumn of 1649 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. There is a tradition that the defenders used sacks of wool to block up breaches in the walls created by enemy cannon. These woolsacks and a representation of the Hall can be seen in the coat of arms issued to one of their members in 1763. It is alleged that Alexander Redmond received favourable terms from Cromwell and died in the Hall in 1650 or 1651 after which his surviving family were evicted, allowed only to retain a third of their original estates in County Wexford. The Loftus family were English 'Planters' who had owned land in the neighbourhood from around 1590 when Sir Dudley Loftus was granted the lands around Kilcloggan. Nicholas Loftus acquired the Manor of Fethard-on-Sea in 1634 and Fethard Castle became the family residence, that was afterwards occupied by the Redmond family after they were evicted from The Hall which is now Loftus Hall. After the end of Cromwell's campaign, Nicholas Loftus was given extensive lands in the south of County Wexford and purchased the Hall from 'several Adventurers and soldiers', but it was only in 1666 when his son Henry moved to the Hall from Dungulph that it became the principal residence of the Loftus family. To establish the new name of his property he had the following inscription inscribed in stone on the entrance piers at Portersgate: 'Henry Loftus of Loftus Hall Esq. 1680'. Nonetheless, the old name remained in use till the end of the century. In 1684 Henry Loftus carried out extensive repairs to the Hall, which presumably needed repairing after the turbulent events of the previous decades. The Loftus family rose in the peerage over the following centuries. In 1800 the then owner of the Hall, the first Earl of Ely, previously Baron Loftus of Loftus Hall, was created Marquess of Ely. It was his descendant, the 4th Marquess, who between 1872 and 1884, refurbished the old Hall, and used the existing structure, resulting in the present house. The Redmond family had disputed the claim of the Loftus family in court but without success. In 1684 they were compensated with lands in the Barony of Ballaghkeene in the north of County Wexford. Some of their descendants joined the movement of the Wild Geese and served in a number of foreign armies most notably that of France. Others were involved in banking and politics, and became a prominent local political dynasty in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in support of the Irish Party of Isaac Butt and Charles Stuart Parnell. The most famous of these was John Redmond who led the party till his death in 1918. Loftus Hall today Between 1872 and 1884, The Most Honorable John Henry Wellington Graham Loftus, 4th Marquess of Ely (1849-1889), under the guidance of his mother Lady Jane Hope Vere Loftus (Lady in Waiting to Queen Victoria), undertook an extensive rebuilding of the entire mansion, adding many of the famous elements such as the grand staircase, mosaic tiled floor, elaborate parquet flooring and technical elements which had not been seen in houses in Ireland at the time, such as flushing toilets and blown air heating. A lot of Lord Ely's inspiration was taken from Osborne House, the Queen's summer residence on the Isle of Wight. The extensive works were believed to have been undertaken to facilitate a visit from the Queen, but this didn't happen and the family never got to fully enjoy the house, with the 4th Marquess dying very young without issue and leaving the estate, in a poor financial state, to his cousin who eventually elected to place it on the market. A three-storey non-basement mansion, nine bays to the front with a balustraded parapet. In 1917, Loftus Hall was bought by the Sisters of Providence and turned into a convent and a school for young girls interested in joining the order. In 1983, it was purchased by Michael Devereaux who reopened it as \\"Loftus Hall Hotel\\", which was subsequently closed again in the late 1990s. In 2011, the house was purchased by the Quigley family. In more recent times the hall had been run as a tourist attraction with guided tours of the property and seasonal events, with people travelling from all over the world to take part in paranormal investigations following Ghost Adventures with Zak Bagans, Aaron Goodwin and Nick Groff. The Gothic thriller The Lodgers was shot on location at Loftus Hall in 2016 and premiered to International acclaim at TIFF 2017. The hall was put up on the market for sale in 2020. The name 'Loftus Hall' or 'Loftushall' is also applied to the townland surrounding the mansion. The entire townland of Loftus Hall, including the building itself, can be overlooked from Hook Lighthouse.  Ghost stories  Charles Tottenham became Lord of the manor (having to adopt the Loftus name to inherit lands and title as per instructions of Nicolas Loftus 1752) by marrying the Honorable Anne Loftus daughter of the first Viscount Loftus, and they had six children, four boys and two girls ‚Äì Elizabeth and Anne. However, his wife became ill and died while the girls were still young. Two years later, Tottenham married his cousin Jane Cliffe, and they lived together, along with Anne, in Loftus Hall. One evening Charles was resting in his home in 1775 with his second wife and daughter from his first marriage, Anne, while the Loftus family were away on business. During a storm, a ship unexpectedly arrived at the Hook Peninsula, where the mansion was located. A young man was welcomed into the mansion. Anne and the young man became very close. One night, the family and mysterious man were in the Game Room playing cards. In the game, each player received 3 cards apart from Anne who was only dealt 2 by the mystery man. A butler serving the Tottenham family at the table was just about to question the man when Anne bent down to pick another card from the floor which she must have dropped. It is said that when Anne bent over to pick up the card, she looked beneath the table to see that the mysterious man had a cloven foot. It was then that Anne stood up and said to the man you have a cloven foot and the man went up through the roof, leaving behind a large hole in the ceiling. Soon Anne became mentally ill. It is believed that the family were ashamed of Anne and locked her away in her favourite room; where she would be happy, yet out of everyone's view; which was known as the Tapestry Room. She refused food and drink, and sat with her knees under her chin, looking out the Tapestry Room window across the sea to where Dunmore East is today, waiting for her mysterious stranger to return until she died in the Tapestry Room in 1775. It is said that when she died, they could not straighten her body, as her muscles had seized, and she was buried in the same sitting position in which she had died.  Media representations  A partially independent documentary film was made by Waterford man Rick Whelan, which was released in 1993 as The Legend of Loftus Hall. This film details the story, dramatising certain parts, such as the card game, with actors. The documentary was well received, with Whelan now seen locally and nationally as a figure of authority on the history of Loftus Hall. The Legend of Loftus Hall stars Elaine Lumley as Anne and Jim O'Mara as Broaders. It also features a full supporting cast of all the characters from the legend, with Liam Murphy as Loftus and Frank Coughlan as Charles Tottenham. A new feature film, simply titled Loftus Hall, was announced in early 2006 and development began on the project in 2007. Actors Keith Duffy, Samantha Mumba and Adelaide Clemens have reportedly been in talks at various stages to appear in the film. Samantha Mumba appeared in Dublin in January 2010 to promote the film. Duffy reportedly left the project midway through 2010 due to prior contractual commitments that would have interfered with the film's proposed schedule. In a recent interview at the launch party of Frilogy.com, Samantha Mumba stated that details on Loftus Hall were being kept top secret. After suffering financial difficulties throughout 2010 that stalled the production, it was announced during a questions and answers session at the 2011 Galway Film Fleadh that funding had been secured and the project was being completely rebooted to make it much darker and grittier. It was also stated that the resulting film will be much more accurate and faithful to the source material. The release date was originally set as 1 October 2012, which was later pushed back to 2013. It has been confirmed that Loftus Hall will be the first Irish film to be released in 3D. In April 2011, an unrelated amateur production was announced, simply entitled 'Loftus'. A full theatrical trailer was produced as a funding and marketing tool for the project. In August 2014, Loftus Hall was investigated by the US paranormal TV show, Ghost Adventures. Loftus Hall was featured in the Ghost Adventures Halloween special, 'Celtic Demons', in October 2014. Loftus Hall was the inspiration for Fowl Manor, one of the primary settings of the franchise Artemis Fowl, author Eoin Colfer having worked there as a child.

Vol. 4, p. 312. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Biography =Early career= He entered the Spanish colonial army as an infantry cadet on 6 January 1812. He participated in 22 actions in the Mexican War of Independence on the Spanish side. He was arrested for criticizing King Ferdinand VII and sentenced to exile to Spain. However, he escaped imprisonment and remained in Mexico. He joined the Army of the Three Guarantees, led by Agust√≠n de Iturbide, where he participated in another 11 military actions. In June 1821, under the First Mexican Empire, he was made a lieutenant colonel. On 11 February 1823, when he was then in charge of the plaza of Puebla, he pronounced against the empire of Agust√≠n de Iturbide (the Plan de Casa Mata). He rose in revolt again on 21 December 1829, this time from Guadalajara in support of Anastasio Bustamante's Plan de Jalapa in opposition to President Vicente Guerrero. Bustamante took power the following 1 January. In 1832, Paredes was promoted to brigadier general. He entered the political field in 1835. Briefly in December 1838, he was minister of war. In 1839, he helped Jalisco Governor Escobedo suppress the federalist revolt of 18 May. On 8 August 1841, he headed a reactionary revolt against the regime of conservative President Bustamante, whom he accused of not fighting to recover Texas and yielding to the 1838 French invasion in the Pastry War. He, Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna and other rebels signed the Plan de Tacubaya against Bustamante on 28 September 1841. Bustamante agreed to resign, Francisco Javier Echeverr√≠a was chosen interim president, and three weeks later Santa Anna occupied the presidency. Paredes was not included in the new cabinet, and he felt he had received inadequate reward for his support. A strong follower of Santa Anna before this point, his support now began to cool. Paredes was military governor of Jalisco from 3 November 1841 to 28 January 1843. In October 1843 at Celaya, he withdrew recognition of President Santa Anna. Santa Anna also lost other support, and Congress named Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera president on 7 January 1845, marginalizing Paredes. =The coup d'√©tat= When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War appeared imminent in 1845, Paredes was entrusted with the defense of the country. He was sent to San Luis Potos√≠. There, on 14 December 1845, alleging lack of supplies, he rose in revolt against President Herrera (Plan de San Luis). Instead of marching to the disputed territories, he marched on the capital. On 30 December 1845, General Gabriel Valencia, in charge of the garrison of Mexico City, seized power and announced his support for Paredes. Valencia held executive power for three days and then turned it over to Paredes. Paredes entered Mexico City on 2 January 1846. On the following day, he was named president of Mexico by a junta of notables he had assembled from heads of governmental departments. On 4 January, he officially took the oath of office, but did not begin exercising power. =As president= On 1 January 1846, the state of Yucat√°n declared its independence from Mexico and its neutrality in the war with the United States. General Pedro Ampudia was defeated by U.S. forces under General Zachary Taylor at Front√≥n de Santa Isabel on 5 March 1846. Ampudia was replaced by General Mariano Arista, who was also defeated, at Palo Alto. Thereupon Arista was arrested and Ampudia reappointed. On 12 June 1846, Paredes was officially reelected president by Congress. He chose General Nicol√°s Bravo as his vice- president. On 20 June, he was officially made commander of the Mexican army. His administration continued until 28 July 1846, when he turned the government over to Bravo to take the field to combat his enemies. The country was in a state of chaos. Paredes took the position that the best way to preserve the country was to turn it into a monarchy with a Spanish sovereign. A royalist party was organized in Mexico City, favoring the Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, cousin and brother-in-law of Queen Isabella II of Spain. In opposition to this, revolt broke out in Jalisco under General Jos√© Mar√≠a Y√°√±ez on 21 May, and Jos√© Mariano Salas rose in the capital in August. Salas deposed Paredes and re-instituted federalism (4 August), proclaiming the return of Santa Anna and the convoking of a constituent congress. =Aftermath= Paredes fled, but was taken prisoner and confined to a convent. In October, he was exiled to France. He returned to Mexico in 1848, in time to oppose the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war with the United States. Together with Manuel Doblado and Padre Celedonio D√≥meco de Jarauta, he again rose in armed revolt, but was defeated by Bustamante at Guanajuato on 18 July 1848. He was exiled again, but was included in a general amnesty in April 1849. He returned to the country again in that year. He died in poverty in Mexico City in September 1849.

He is as yet the only Mexican President from the city of Monterrey. He was a supporter of a centralist (as opposed to a federalist) national government, and a confidante of President of Mexico General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Canalizo was President of Mexico two times, for a total of about one year in 1843 and 1844, during the complex Mexican historical times after the one decade-long Mexican War of Independence and before the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Valent√≠n Canalizo had previously been the Mayor of Mexico City, after being Governor of Puebla state, and years before, Mayor of the city of Cuernavaca. He was military governor of both the states of Oaxaca and State of Mexico in the early 1830s. At age 53, three years before his death, he served as Minister of War (Defense Minister) with President Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as. He led the North and East Army Divisions to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, defending Northern and Eastern Mexican territory. In his late teens as his first job in the army, he fought in the Mexican War of Independence. Career He was the son of Vicente Canalizo and Mar√≠a Josefa Bocadillo and baptized on 16 February 1795 at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Monterrey, =The War of Independence= In 1811, at age 17, he entered the Celaya Regiment as a royalist infantry cadet, fighting against the insurgents. On 2 March 1821, under the influence of Agust√≠n de Iturbide, whom he knew and respected, he swore allegiance to independent Mexico. After that he participated in the siege of Valladolid (Morelia) and the capture of San Juan del R√≠o and Zimap√°n. He was forced to surrender to General Bracho at San Luis Potos√≠, and he was wounded in action at Azcapotzalco. He received a battlefield promotion to lieutenant colonel, and was in command of two companies during the siege of Mexico City. =After independence= After independence, he was an aide to General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera in the Jalisco campaign. In December 1829 he joined the Plan de Jalapa. Having been promoted to colonel, he was second in command of the brigade that pacified Jamiltepec, the Costa Chica and the Mixtecs. He was part of the court that sentenced Vicente Guerrero to death in 1831. He opposed the revolution of 1832, but later accepted the Conventions of Zavaleta. In 1833, he revolted in favor of Santa Anna under the slogan of religi√≥n y fueros (\\"religion and privileges\\", referring to the privileges of soldiers and the clergy that had been eliminated by Liberal reformist President Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as). Under this banner he took over Oaxaca. He was military governor of the states of Oaxaca and M√©xico during the centralist period. From 1835 to 1841, he fought intensely against the Liberals. He broke the siege of Acapulco, went on a military expedition to the Mixteca region, broke another siege in Oaxaca. He attacked Urrea in Durango and Longinos Montenegro in Tampico, occupied Monterrey and Monclova, pursued Servando Canales, and finally returned to Mexico City. In 1841, Santa Anna promoted him to brigadier general. =First term as President= In December 1842 he supported the Plan de Huejotzingo. He contributed to establishing the dictatorship of Santa Anna on 4 March 1843. Santa Anna named him president on 4 October 1843. This transfer was approved by Congress. Canalizo's period in office lasted until 4 June 1844. Santa Anna remained at his hacienda Encero during that time. The government gave aid to the charity sisters (Hermanas de la Caridad) and the San Gregorio School (Colegio), and established the ordinances governing the Military College. They transferred the Medical School to the Colegio San Ildefonso. Taxes were increased to support the army. Congress during this time established garrisons in the Western (Occidente) and Eastern (Oriente) departments, and struggled to regulate the chopping of the nation's forests. Canalizo arranged a new meeting place for the Chamber of Deputies (House of Representatives, USA / House of Commons, UK) after flooding had wrecked the old chamber. He appointed Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera president of the Consejo de Gobierno (Government Council). In 1844, Canalizo's presidential office term ended and Santa Anna went back into power. Canalizo went off to San Luis Potos√≠ to take command of the Ej√©rcito del Norte (North Army) and prepare it for a campaign in Texas. =Second term as President= Valent√≠n Canalizo returned to Mexico City in September 1844 to replace Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera as president of Mexico. This time he served from 21 September 1844 to 6 December 1844. During this term he was in open conflict with Congress, because of its strong opposition to Santa Anna. Canalizo had received verbal instructions from Santa Anna to dissolve the Congress, but when he attempted this, the members objected. Thereupon he issued a decree suspending the Congress and prohibiting its meeting. Immediately, on 4 December 1844, the statue of Santa Anna in El Volador was decorated with a white hood and a rope noose, like a hanged man. On 30 October 1844, the local authorities in Guadalajara revolted under Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga. On 30 November, the palace guard prevented the deputies (congressmen / MPs) and senators from entering the chambers of Congress. By 6 December, the revolution had spread throughout the country. On that day the troops of the barracks, other soldiers and much of the populace joined the revolt. The soldiers from took Canalizo prisoner. They turned over the government to Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera. Plans were made to bring charges against Canalizo, but soon a general amnesty was declared. Canalizo was conducted to San Juan de Ul√∫a, where he sailed for C√°diz, Spain, on 25 October 1845. He returned to Mexico in 1846 and was \\"Minister of War\\" (Defense Minister) in the cabinet of President Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as (24 December 1846 - 23 February 1847). During this term he supported the mortmain law and dealt severely with disturbances of the public peace. =Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War= Canalizo was given command of the Eastern Division at the time of the United States attack on Veracruz. He prevented the soldiers under his command from joining the 1847 Revolt of the Polkos and he negotiated an end to the revolt with Mat√≠as de la Pe√±a y Barrag√°n. (The convention ending the revolt was signed on 21 March 1848.) He then marched to Veracruz, but Santa Anna took command of the troops. Puente Nacional was abandoned without a fight, and Santa Anna was decisively defeated at Cerro Gordo. The Mexicans abandoned a supply of arms at the castle of Perote, Veracruz. Canalizo abandoned the war, and refused to return to battle because of severe war strategy disagreements with Santa Anna, and thus took no part in the defense of Mexico City. =Final years and descendants= Retired from public life as of December 1847, he died of pneumonia in his Mexico City house on 20 February 1850 at age 56. He was buried at the Convent of San Diego in central Mexico City (today, Ex-Convento de San Diego). His granddaughter Josefa Canalizo Valdez, daughter of his son Antonio Canalizo Danila and Procopia Valdez Osuna, married Don Guillermo Haas de la Vega, a legendary half-German entrepreneur from Mazatl√°n city and grandson of Sinaloa state governor Rafael de la Vega y R√°bago of the De la Vega family dynasty of state governors. Because Don Haas was a prominent figure in Sinaloa state, President of Mexico Francisco I. Madero invited him to become state governor in 1912, a political post that he turned down due to his numerous business responsibilities. Among other things, he owned \\"El Roble\\", a Sinaloa sugar cane hacienda and village founded by him (the famous mariachi song \\"El Sinaloense\\" is dedicated to El Roble and the Haas Canalizo family), and the Mazatl√°n Central Hotel (the largest and finest in town), as well as his silver mines, his two department and hardware stores (the only ones in the city), his farming haciendas in Navolato, and his company \\"Northwestern Liquors\\", and he held posts as co-founder of the Occidental Bank of Mexico, chairman and president of the Mazatl√°n Chamber of Commerce, and co- founder and vice president of the Mazatl√°n Water Supply Company. Josefa Canalizo's husband, Guillermo Haas de la Vega, was the son of German immigrant Agust√≠n (August) Haas Bertram and Rafaela de la Vega, daughter of Sinaloa state governor Rafael de la Vega y R√°bago of the Veguist historic period also known as Veguism when all Sinaloa governors were members of the De la Vega family. Today's Casa Museo Haas in Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa, was the family mansion of Do√±a Josefa Canalizo and Don Guillermo Haas de la Vega and their eleven children. The mansion's last inhabitant was a grandson of theirs, and great- great grandson of President Valent√≠n Canalizo, Antonio Haas,Antonio Haas biography and Mazatl√°n Literature Award creationThe Antonio Haas files, Sinaloa College (El Colegio de Sinaloa) elcolegiodesinaloa.com a renowned lawyer and economist from Harvard and Georgetown Universities, founder of the Mazatl√°n Literature Award of Mexico, author, journalist and twice Mexico National Journalism Award, horticulturist, and cultural philanthropist who died in the house in 2007. His public wake for the people of Mazatl√°n was held in the Mazatl√°n Cathedral, and hours later at the Mazatl√°n Opera House Teatro √Ångela Peralta which he rescued and restored, his statue was placed at the opera's foyer. The local city theater Teatro Antonio Haas also bears his name. Upon his passing, the Mazatl√°n city government bought the Haas Canalizo family home. In 2011, with the support of the Mazatl√°n Institute of Culture, Tourism and Art general director Ra√∫l Rico Mendiola, the Haas Canalizo mansion became Mazatl√°n's cultural center the Haas House Museum (Casa Haas) by wish of the family, and by initiative of Guillermo Haas de la Vega and Josefa Canalizo's great-granddaughter, Lady Marina De Santiago-de Borb√≥n Haas Canalizo (Marina St James-of Bourbon Haas Canalizo), great-great-great granddaughter of President Valent√≠n Canalizo,Haas Canalizo family, descendants of President of Mexico Valent√≠n Canalizo, Mexican national newspaper and also great-great granddaughter of Prime Minister of Spain Luis Gonz√°lez-Bravo and Queen of Spain Isabella II of Bourbon (Isabel II de Borb√≥n).

However, the last decade has seen the description of a new family, the Torquaratoridae, evidently limited to the deep sea, in which most of the species crawl on the surface of the ocean bottom and alternatively rise into the water column, evidently to drift to new foraging sites.Holland ND, Jones WJ, Elena J, Ruhl HA, Smith KL (2009) A new deep-sea species of epibenthic acorn worm (Hemichordata, Enteropneusta).

Acorn worm on the ocean floor Most acorn worms range from in length, with the largest species, Balanoglossus gigas, reaching or more. The body is made up of three main parts: an acorn- shaped proboscis, a short fleshy collar that lies behind it, and a long, worm- like trunk. The creature's mouth is located at the collar behind the proboscis. The skin is covered with cilia as well as glands that secrete mucus. Some produce a bromide compound that gives them a medicinal smell and might protect them from bacteria and predators. Acorn worms move only sluggishly, using ciliary action and peristalsis of the proboscis. =Digestive system= Many acorn worms are detritus feeders, eating sand or mud and extracting organic detritus. Others feed on organic material suspended in the water, which they can draw into the mouth using the cilia on the gill bars. A groove lined with cilia lies just in front of the mouth and directs suspended food into the mouth and may allow the animal to taste. The mouth cavity is tubular, with a narrow diverticulum or stomochord extending up into the proboscis. This diverticulum was once thought to be homologous with the notochord of chordates, hence the name \\"hemichordate\\" for the phylum. The mouth opens posteriorly into a pharynx with a row of gill slits along either side. The remainder of the digestive system consists of an oesophagus and intestine; there is no stomach. In some families there are openings in the dorsal surface of the oesophagus connecting to the external surface, through which water from the food can be squeezed, helping to concentrate it. Digestion occurs in the intestine, with food material being pulled through by cilia, rather than by muscular action. Acorn worms breathe by drawing in oxygenated water through their mouth. The water then flows out the animal's gills which are on its trunk. Thus, the acorn worm breathes about the same way as fish. =Circulatory system= Acorn worms have an open circulatory system, in which the blood flows through the tissues sinuses. A dorsal blood vessel in the mesentery above the gut delivers blood to a sinus in the proboscis that contains a muscular sac acting as a heart. Unlike the hearts of most other animals, however, this structure is a closed fluid-filled vesicle whose interior does not connect directly to the blood system. Nonetheless, it does regularly pulsate, helping to push blood through the surrounding sinuses. From the central sinus in the collar, blood flows to a complex series of sinuses and peritoneal folds in the proboscis. This set of structures is referred to as a glomerulus and may have an excretory function, since acorn worms otherwise have no defined excretory system. From the proboscis, blood flows into a single blood vessel running underneath the digestive tract, from which smaller sinuses supply blood to the trunk, and back into the dorsal vessel. The blood of acorn worms is colourless and acellular. =Respiratory system= Acorn worms continually form new gill slits as they grow in size, with some older individuals having more than a hundred on each side. Each slit consists of a branchial chamber opening to the pharynx through a U-shaped cleft and to the exterior through a dorso-lateral pore (see diagram below). Cilia push water through the slits, maintaining a constant flow. The tissues surrounding the slits are well supplied with blood sinuses. =Nervous system= A plexus of nerves lies underneath the skin, and is concentrated into both dorsal and ventral nerve cords. While the ventral cord runs only as far as the collar, the dorsal cord reaches into the proboscis, and is partially separated from the epidermis in that region. This part of the dorsal nerve cord is often hollow, and may well be homologous with the brain of vertebrates. In acorn worms, it seems to be primarily involved with coordinating muscular action of the body during burrowing and crawling. Acorn worms have no eyes, ears or other special sense organs, except for the ciliary organ in front of the mouth, which appears to be involved in filter feeding and perhaps taste (3). There are, however, numerous nerve endings throughout the skin. =Similarities to chordates= Acorn worms are considered more highly specialised and advanced than other similarly shaped worm-like creatures. They have a circulatory system with a heart that also functions as a kidney. Acorn worms have gill-like structures that they use for breathing, similar to the gills of primitive fish. Therefore, acorn worms are sometimes said to be a link between classical invertebrates and vertebrates. Some also have a postanal tail which may be homologous to the post-anal tail of vertebrates. An interesting trait is that its three-section body plan is no longer present in the vertebrates, except for the anatomy of the frontal neural tube, later developed into a brain which is divided into three main parts. This means some of the original anatomy of the early chordate ancestors is still present even if it is not always visible. One theory is that the three-part body originates from an early common ancestor of all the deuterostomes, and maybe even from a common bilateral ancestor of both the deuterostomes and protostomes. Studies have shown that the gene expression in the embryo share three of the same signaling centers that shape the brains of all vertebrates, but instead of taking part in the formation of their neural system,Secondary organizers of the early brain and the location of the meso-diencephalic dopaminergic precursor cells Retrieved March 10, 2014 they are controlling the development of the different body regions. Phylogeny The internal relationships within the Enteropneusta are shown below. The tree is based on 16S +18S rRNA sequence data and phylogenomic studies from multiple sources. Lifestyle Meioglossus psammophilus. Acorn worms are rarely seen by humans because of their lifestyle. They live in U-shaped burrows on the sea-bed, from the shoreline down to a depth of 10,000 ft. (3,050 m). The worms lie there with the proboscis sticking out of one opening in the burrow. Acorn worms are generally slow burrowers. To obtain food, many acorn worms swallow sand or mud that contains organic matter and microorganisms in the manner of earthworms (this is known as deposit feeding). At low tide, they stick out their rear ends at the surface and excrete coils of processed sediments (casts). Another method that some acorn worms use to obtain food is to collect suspended particles of organic matter and microbes from the water. This is known as suspension feeding. Reproduction Acorn worms are dioecious, having separate biological sexes, although at least some species are also capable of asexual reproduction. They have paired gonads, which lie close to the pharynx and release the gametes through a small pore near to the gill slits. The female lays a large number of eggs embedded in a gelatinous mass of mucus, which are then externally fertilized by the male before water currents break up the mass and disperse the individual eggs. Acorn worm life cycle by M. Singh In most species, the eggs hatch into planktonic larvae with elongated bodies covered in cilia. In some species, these develop directly into adults, but in others, there is a free-swimming intermediate stage referred to as a tornaria larva. These are very similar in appearance to the bipinnaria larvae of starfishes, with convoluted bands of cilia running around the body. Since the embryonic development of the blastula within the egg is also very similar to that of echinoderms, this suggests a close phylogenetic link between the two groups. After a number of days or weeks, a groove begins to form around the larval midsection, with the anterior portion eventually destined to become the proboscis, while the remainder forms the collar and trunk. The larvae eventually settle down and change into tiny adults to take on the burrowing lifestyle. A few species, such as Saccoglossus kowalevskii, lack even the planktonic larval stage, hatching directly as miniature adults.

Formed in 1986, CONAIE has pursued social change on behalf of the region's significant native population using a wide range of tactics, including direct action. CONAIE is most well known for its organization of popular uprisings (\\"levantamientos populares\\") that have been known to include blockading of commercial arteries and the seizure and occupation of government buildings. Overview CONAIE's political agenda includes the strengthening of a positive indigenous identity, recuperation of land rights, environmental sustainability, opposition to neoliberalism and rejection of U.S. military involvement in South America (for example Plan Colombia). In 2013 CONAIE became more involved in discussions with other indigenous organizations involving land rights and environmental sustainability due to deals made by the government with large multinational oil companies. These deals primarily concern the Amazon basin, and would take over much of the indigenous land that is currently inhabited. There has been much debate for many years between the governments, the indigenous peoples, and the oil companies. Chevron (formerly Texaco) is a major oil company which has had a presence in Ecuador; recently Chevron has come into many Ecuadorian headlines regarding drilling rights that they are attempting to acquire. CONAIE has taken a stance against Chevron and their hope of drilling on indigenous land. Organization CONAIE represents the following indigenous peoples: Shuar, Achuar, Siona, Secoya, Cof√°n, Huaorani, Z√°paro, Chachi, Ts√°chila, Aw√°, Epera, Manta, Wancavilca and Quichua. CONAIE is composed of three regional federations: the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon (Confederaci√≥n de Nacionalidades Ind√≠genas de la Amazon√≠a Ecuatoriana; CONFENIAE) in the eastern Amazon region or Oriente; The Confederation of Peoples of Quichua Nationality in the central mountain region (Confederaci√≥n de Pueblos de la Nacionalidad Kichuas del Ecuador; ECUARUNARI); and the Coordination of Indigenous and Black Organizations of the Ecuadorian Coast (Coordinadora de Organizaciones Ind√≠genas y Negras de la Costa Ecuatoriana; CONAICE). History CONAIE was founded at a convention of some 500 indigenous representatives on November 13-November 16, 1986. Initially explicitly rejecting the use of the electoral process, CONAIE developed an economic and political strategy to redefine and implement participatory democracy. Simultaneously, CONAIE called for the conversion of Ecuador into a multi-nation state recognizing the national autonomy of 12 indigenous nations, run by \\"popular parliaments\\". Throughout the 1990s, CONAIE repeatedly mobilized thousands of indigenous campesinos to shut down Quito, clogging the streets with traditional dance, art and song while making demands of the political structure via direct negotiation. These protests often came in response to International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies. CONAIE adopted a programme with these 16 demands:http://www.yachana.org/earchivo/conaie/hoy_en.php #A public declaration that Ecuador is a plurinational country (to be ratified by the constitution) #The government must grant lands and titles to lands to the nationalities #Solutions to water and irrigation needs #Absolution of indigenous debts to FODERUMA and the National Development Bank #Freezing of consumer prices #Conclusion of priority projects in Indian communities #Nonpayment of rural land taxes #Expulsion of the Summer Institute of Linguistics #Free commercial handicraft activities #CONAIE protection of archaeological sites #Officialization of Indian medicine #Cancellation of government decree that created parallel land-reform granting bodies #The government should immediately grant funds to the nationalities #The government should grant funds for bilingual education #Respect for the rights of the child #The fixing of fair prices for products  1990 uprising  In May 1990, on the 500th anniversary since Columbus' first trip to the Americas, the \\"1990 Indigenous Uprising\\" took place in Quito with the occupation of the Santa Domingo Church. Led by CONAIE, protesters took to the streets to head towards Santa Domingo in May \\"to protest the failure of the legal system to process land claims.\\"Colloredo-Mansfeld, Rudi. Fighting like a community Andean civil society in an era of Indian uprisings. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009. The protesters intended to occupy the church until CONAIE was able to meet with a government representative to discuss changes in policy regarding their land claim issues; as a result of the strong protests the government became worried and demanded that a police force surround the church. It was not until June that the pivotal action of this movement (which ultimately led to its end) occurred and changed the way that indigenous peoples in Ecuador were viewed. The occupiers in the Santa Domingo church were about to begin a hunger strike when \\"hundreds of thousands of Indians, in some areas with the support of mestizo peasants, blocked local highways and took over urban plazas. Their demands were focused mostly on land, but also included such issues as state services, cultural rights, and the farm prices of agricultural products.\\"Korovkin, Tanya. \\"Indians, peasants, and the state: The growth of a community movement in the ecuadorian andes.\\" CERLAC Occasional Paper Series 1 (1992): 1-47. This movement caused so much disruption to federal commerce and social order that the government relented and met with the leaders of CONAIE. This movement, however, did not gain the indigenous peoples much ground in terms of agrarian reform. They accomplished some of their goals and saw some of their terms met, but it would not be until 1994 that CONAIE would make another stand.  1994 uprising  In 1994 another massive mobilization was realized in response to a new neo-liberal Agrarian Reform Law and a World Bank loan granted in order to privatize the oil sector. The oil deal threatened physical damage indigenous groups (earlier oil exploration had led to contamination of water and environmental degradation) in the Amazon and loss of their land holdings. The Agrarian Reform Law was an attempt to sell communally held land to stimulate competition and productivity, reduce and consolidate indigenous land holdings, and privatize the water system, all of which represented great threats to indigenous livelihood. Because of the ferocity of the uprising and criticism of the government led by CONAIE, the land reform and water privatization basically disappeared and although the oil privatization passed, indigenous groups gained some protection. In short, however, in 1994 the process of globalization was well underway and it constituted immense danger for all indigenous groups in Ecuador because of the potential for loss of land, sovereignty, and the destruction of their natural habitats. CONAIE had achieved much, but still lacked that vital connection to mainstream politics that held the key to protecting indigenous communities.  Pachakutik  Prior to 1996 CONAIE had been very untrusting of politicians and wary of those who sought to become involved in politics because of politicians' tendency to make concessions. Nevertheless, the situation in Ecuador, especially in the Amazon region of the Oriente, was becoming desperate, as oil exploration was due to increase at any moment. Rumblings began within the organization to adapt to the political process, but a statute was passed in 1995 by CONAIE prohibiting members from running for political office. In 1996, CONAIE reversed its stand on elections and played a major role in the formation of Pachakutik (Pluri-National Pachakutik United Movement - New Country), an electoral coalition of indigenous and non-indigenous social movements including CONFEUNASSC-CNC, Ecuador's largest campesino federation. Although Pachakutik won many local and congressional seats, it failed to garner significant votes in Ecuador's presidential 1996 election.  1997 uprising  In August 1997 CONAIE led two straight days of protest against the lack of constitutional reform and held the government accountable, as the process was thereafter soon underway with the appointing of the Assembly of Constitutional Reform. What followed this process was a new constitution that brought CONAIE and the indigenous movement the greatest success in the history of its existence. The changes to Ecuador's constitution in 1998 were not solely related to indigenous demands, but it changed the role of indigenous people in Ecuadorian society completely. The actual wording of the constitution defined Ecuador as a multiethnic and multicultural state, which would set the groundwork for the respect of indigenous rights that had been sought for so long. Many new rights were explicitly granted to indigenous groups in the new document, including ‚Äúthe right to maintain, develop, and fortify their spiritual, cultural, linguistic, social, political and economic identity and traditions.‚Äù Through the constitution the state was given many new responsibilities and standards to follow in terms of environmental conservation, the elimination of contamination, and sustainable management. Related to this was the right given to all people (targeted toward indigenous communities) that they must give prior consent before projects can be undertaken on their lands which will affect their lands. Finally, the document provides protection of self-determination among indigenous lands, preserving traditional political structures, and follows International Labour Organization, Convention 169 that outlines generally accepted international law on indigenous rights. All of these points had been sought after for so many years and were finally guaranteed in this rewrite of the most important document in the country. Despite CONAIE and Pachakutik's triumph in this endeavor, government implementation of the policy has not exactly been consistent with the outline in that new constitution and the indigenous organizations have struggled since 1998. In cases such as ARCO‚Äôs deal to exploit oil resources in the Amazon, the government has totally ignored these new indigenous rights and sold communal land to be developed without another thought. Such violations have become commonplace and the reformation of the constitution seems in many ways to have just been a populist tactic used by the government to appease the indigenous groups while continuing to persistently pursue its neoliberal agenda. Because of this there has been an increasing amount of tension and differences of opinion within the indigenous movement, both between Pachakutik and CONAIE and within CONAIE itself. There even exists frustration among local tribes and the efforts of CONAIE because of the inability to stop the aggression of the government despite all that had been achieved.  2000 uprising  On January 21, 2000, in response to President Jamil Mahuad's proposed dollarization of the Ecuadorian economy, CONAIE, in coordination with organizations like CONFEUNASSC-CNC, blocked roads and cut off agricultural supplies to Ecuador's major cities. At the same time, rural indigenous protesters marched on Quito. In response, government officials ordered transit lines not to service Indians and individuals with indigenous characteristics were forcibly removed from interprovincial buses in an effort to prevent protesters from reaching the capitol. Nevertheless, 20,000 arrived in Quito where they were joined by students, local residents, 500 military personnel, and a group of rogue colonels. Angry demonstrators led by Colonel Lucio Guti√©rrez stormed the Congress of Ecuador and declared a new \\"National Salvation Government\\". Five hours later, the armed forces called for the resignation of President Mahuad. For a period of less than 24 hours, Ecuador was ruled by a three-man junta - CONAIE's president Antonio Vargas, army colonel Lucio Guti√©rrez, and retired supreme court justice Carlos Sol√≥rzano. The coup was made possible by the support of the military; however, the military's influence also served to deflate the revolutionary potential of the popular uprising. Only a few hours after taking the presidential palace, Col. Lucio and other collaborators handed over power to the armed forces' chief of staff, General Carlos Mendoza. That night Mendoza was contacted by the Organization of American States as well as the U.S. State Department, which hinted at the imposition of a Cuban-style isolation on Ecuador if power was not returned to the neoliberal Mahuad administration.https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/world/ecuador-coup-shifts- control-to-no-2-man.html Additionally, Mendoza was contacted by senior White House policy makers who threatened to end all bilateral aid and World Bank lending to Ecuador. The next morning, General Mendoza dissolved the new government and ceded power to Vice President Gustavo Noboa.  2002 elections and the FTAA  Members of CONAIE marched against the FTAA summit in Quito (October 31, 2002) In 2002, CONAIE split its resources between political campaigning and a mobilization against the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) 7th Summit, which was being held in Quito. In the presidential elections CONAIE backed populist Lucio Guti√©rrez, a military man who had supported the 2000 coup. Guti√©rrez was not widely trusted, but he was seen as the only alternative to rival candidate √Ålvaro Noboa, the richest man in Ecuador who embodied popular fears of crony capitalism. Lucio Guti√©rrez won the presidential race with 55% of the final vote, owing much of his victory to support from Pachakutik.  2005 uprising  Six months after the election of Guti√©rrez, CONAIE proclaimed its official break with the government in response to what CONAIE termed a betrayal of \\"the mandate given to it by the Ecuadorian people in the last elections.\\" Among other things, Guti√©rrez's signing of a Letter of Intent with the International Monetary Fund sparked outrage. (see Indigenous Movement Breaks with President Lucio Guiterrez) In 2005, CONAIE participated in an uprising which ousted president Lucio Guti√©rrez. In an April 2005 Assembly of Peoples, and in their own contentious assembly in May, CONAIE made public calls for the ouster of both Guti√©rrez and the entire mainstream political class under the slogan \\"Que se vayan todos\\" (They all must go), a phrase popularized by the December 2001 Argentine uprising. In August 2005 CONAIE called for action among indigenous peoples in the Sucumbios and Orellana provinces to protest political repression, Petrobras' attempt to expand their petroleum extracting activities to the Yasun√≠ National Park, and the general activities of Occidental Petroleum in the Amazon. Hundreds of protestors from the Amazon region took control of airports and oil installations in the two provinces for five days, which has prompted a strong response from Alfredo Palacio's government in Quito. The government called for a state of emergency in the two provinces and the army was sent in to disperse the protestors with tear gas, but in response to the growing crisis the state oil company has temporarily suspended exports of petroleum. Protestors have gone on record as saying that they want oil revenues to be redirected toward society, making way for more jobs and greater expenditures in infrastructure.  Recent Activity  Since 2005 CONAIE has been focusing less on drastic activism movements and more on policy making and attempting to reach a greater audience in order to educate and spread their platform of environmental use awareness, intercultural education, plurinationality, indigenismo, and multiculturalism. In 2009 CONAIE announced that it would be striking and putting up road blocks in order to protest laws that were to be passed by the government dealing with water management, but also to protest old laws dealing with environment. Unfortunately the protests were not as well organized as they had been previously and did not effectively change any laws or garner much attention in the media.

Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincar√© and others. It culminated in the theory of special relativity proposed by Albert Einstein and subsequent work of Max Planck, Hermann Minkowski and others. Introduction Although Isaac Newton based his physics on absolute time and space, he also adhered to the principle of relativity of Galileo Galilei restating it precisely for mechanical systems.Principia, Corollary 5 to the Laws of Motion This can be stated as: as far as the laws of mechanics are concerned, all observers in inertial motion are equally privileged, and no preferred state of motion can be attributed to any particular inertial observer. However, as to electromagnetic theory and electrodynamics, during the 19th century the wave theory of light as a disturbance of a \\"light medium\\" or Luminiferous ether was widely accepted, the theory reaching its most developed form in the work of James Clerk Maxwell. According to Maxwell's theory, all optical and electrical phenomena propagate through that medium, which suggested that it should be possible to experimentally determine motion relative to the aether. The failure of any known experiment to detect motion through the aether led Hendrik Lorentz, starting in 1892, to develop a theory of electrodynamics based on an immobile luminiferous aether (about whose material constitution Lorentz did not speculate), physical length contraction, and a \\"local time\\" in which Maxwell's equations retain their form in all inertial frames of reference. Working with Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincar√©, having earlier proposed the \\"relativity principle\\" as a general law of nature (including electrodynamics and gravitation), used this principle in 1905 to correct Lorentz's preliminary transformation formulas, resulting in an exact set of equations that are now called the Lorentz transformations. A little later in the same year Albert Einstein published his original paper on special relativity in which, again based on the relativity principle, he independently derived and radically reinterpreted the Lorentz transformations by changing the fundamental definitions of space and time intervals, while abandoning the absolute simultaneity of Galilean kinematics, thus avoiding the need for any reference to a luminiferous aether in classical electrodynamics.Chen (2011), Page 92 Subsequent work of Hermann Minkowski, in which he introduced a 4-dimensional geometric \\"spacetime\\" model for Einstein's version of special relativity, paved the way for Einstein's later development of his general theory of relativity and laid the foundations of relativistic field theories. Aether and electrodynamics of moving bodies =Aether models and Maxwell's equations= Following the work of Thomas Young (1804) and Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1816), it was believed that light propagates as a transverse wave within an elastic medium called luminiferous aether. However, a distinction was made between optical and electrodynamical phenomena so it was necessary to create specific aether models for all phenomena. Attempts to unify those models or to create a complete mechanical description of them did not succeed,Whittaker (1951), 128ff but after considerable work by many scientists, including Michael Faraday and Lord Kelvin, James Clerk Maxwell (1864) developed an accurate theory of electromagnetism by deriving a set of equations in electricity, magnetism and inductance, named Maxwell's equations. He first proposed that light was in fact undulations (electromagnetic radiation) in the same aetherial medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena. However, Maxwell's theory was unsatisfactory regarding the optics of moving bodies, and while he was able to present a complete mathematical model, he was not able to provide a coherent mechanical description of the aether.Whittaker (1951), 240ff After Heinrich Hertz in 1887 demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves, Maxwell's theory was widely accepted. In addition, Oliver Heaviside and Hertz further developed the theory and introduced modernized versions of Maxwell's equations. The \\"Maxwell-Hertz\\" or \\"Heaviside-Hertz\\" equations subsequently formed an important basis for the further development of electrodynamics, and Heaviside's notation is still used today. Other important contributions to Maxwell's theory were made by George FitzGerald, Joseph John Thomson, John Henry Poynting, Hendrik Lorentz, and Joseph Larmor.Whittaker (1951), 319ffJanssen/Stachel (2004), 20 =Search for the aether= Regarding the relative motion and the mutual influence of matter and aether, there were two controversial theories. One was developed by Fresnel (and subsequently Lorentz). This model (Stationary Aether Theory) supposed that light propagates as a transverse wave and aether is partially dragged with a certain coefficient by matter. Based on this assumption, Fresnel was able to explain the aberration of light and many optical phenomena.Whittaker (1951), 107ff The other hypothesis was proposed by George Gabriel Stokes, who stated in 1845 that the aether was fully dragged by matter (later this view was also shared by Hertz). In this model the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid for fast objects and fluid for slower objects. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, but it would be rigid enough to transport light.Whittaker (1951), 386f Fresnel's theory was preferred because his dragging coefficient was confirmed by the Fizeau experiment in 1851, which measured the speed of light in moving liquids.Janssen/Stachel (2004), 4‚Äì15 A. A. Michelson Albert A. Michelson (1881) tried to measure the relative motion of the Earth and aether (Aether-Wind), as it was expected in Fresnel's theory, by using an interferometer. He could not determine any relative motion, so he interpreted the result as a confirmation of the thesis of Stokes.Whittaker (1951), 390f However, Lorentz (1886) showed Michelson's calculations were wrong and that he had overestimated the accuracy of the measurement. This, together with the large margin of error, made the result of Michelson's experiment inconclusive. In addition, Lorentz showed that Stokes' completely dragged aether led to contradictory consequences, and therefore he supported an aether theory similar to Fresnel's.Whittaker (1951), 386ff To check Fresnel's theory again, Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) performed a repetition of the Fizeau experiment. Fresnel's dragging coefficient was confirmed very exactly on that occasion, and Michelson was now of the opinion that Fresnel's stationary aether theory was correct.Janssen/Stachel (2004), 18‚Äì19 To clarify the situation, Michelson and Morley (1887) repeated Michelson's 1881-experiment, and they substantially increased the accuracy of the measurement. However, this now famous Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment again yielded a negative result, i.e., no motion of the apparatus through the aether was detected (although the Earth's velocity is 60 km/s different in the northern winter than summer). So the physicists were confronted with two seemingly contradictory experiments: the 1886-experiment as an apparent confirmation of Fresnel's stationary aether, and the 1887-experiment as an apparent confirmation of Stokes' completely dragged aether.Janssen/Stachel (2004), 19‚Äì20 A possible solution to the problem was shown by Woldemar Voigt (1887), who investigated the Doppler effect for waves propagating in an incompressible elastic medium and deduced transformation relations that left the wave equation in free space unchanged, and explained the negative result of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. The Voigt transformations include the Lorentz factor \\\\scriptstyle{1/\\\\sqrt{1-{v^2}/{c^2}}} for the y- and z-coordinates, and a new time variable \\\\scriptstyle{t'=t-vx/c^2} which later was called \\"local time\\". However, Voigt's work was completely ignored by his contemporaries.Miller (1981), 114‚Äì115Pais (1982), Chap. 6b FitzGerald (1889) offered another explanation of the negative result of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. Contrary to Voigt, he speculated that the intermolecular forces are possibly of electrical origin so that material bodies would contract in the line of motion (length contraction). This was in connection with the work of Heaviside (1887), who determined that the electrostatic fields in motion were deformed (Heaviside Ellipsoid), which leads to physically undetermined conditions at the speed of light.Miller (1981), 99‚Äì100 However, FitzGerald's idea remained widely unknown and was not discussed before Oliver Lodge published a summary of the idea in 1892.Brown (2001) Also Lorentz (1892b) proposed length contraction independently from FitzGerald in order to explain the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. For plausibility reasons, Lorentz referred to the analogy of the contraction of electrostatic fields. However, even Lorentz admitted that that was not a necessary reason and length-contraction consequently remained an ad hoc hypothesis.Miller (1981), 27‚Äì29Janssen (1995), Ch. 3.3 =Lorentz's theory of electrons= Hendrik Antoon Lorentz Lorentz (1892a) set the foundations of Lorentz aether theory, by assuming the existence of electrons which he separated from the aether, and by replacing the \\"Maxwell-Hertz\\" equations by the \\"Maxwell-Lorentz\\" equations. In his model, the aether is completely motionless and, contrary to Fresnel's theory, also is not partially dragged by matter. An important consequence of this notion was that the velocity of light is totally independent of the velocity of the source. Lorentz gave no statements about the mechanical nature of the aether and the electromagnetic processes, but, vice versa, tried to explain the mechanical processes by electromagnetic ones and therefore created an abstract electromagnetic √¶ther. In the framework of his theory, Lorentz calculated, like Heaviside, the contraction of the electrostatic fields. Lorentz (1895) also introduced what he called the \\"Theorem of Corresponding States\\" for terms of first order in \\\\scriptstyle{v/c}. This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the aether) in his \\"fictitious\\" field makes the same observations as a resting observer in his \\"real\\" field. An important part of it was local time \\\\scriptstyle{t'=t-vx/c^2}, which paved the way to the Lorentz transformation and which he introduced independently of Voigt. With the help of this concept, Lorentz could explain the aberration of light, the Doppler effect and the Fizeau experiment as well. However, Lorentz's local time was only an auxiliary mathematical tool to simplify the transformation from one system into another ‚Äì it was Poincar√© in 1900 who recognized that \\"local time\\" is actually indicated by moving clocks.Miller (1982)Zahar (1989)Galison (2002) Lorentz also recognized that his theory violated the principle of action and reaction, since the aether acts on matter, but matter cannot act on the immobile aether.Janssen (1995), Ch. 3.1 A very similar model was created by Joseph Larmor (1897, 1900). Larmor was the first to put Lorentz's 1895-transformation into a form algebraically equivalent to the modern Lorentz transformations, however, he stated that his transformations preserved the form of Maxwell's equations only to second order of \\\\scriptstyle{v/c}. Lorentz later noted that these transformations did in fact preserve the form of Maxwell's equations to all orders of \\\\scriptstyle{v/c}. Larmor noticed on that occasion that length-contraction was derivable from the model; furthermore, he calculated some manner of time dilation for electron orbits. Larmor specified his considerations in 1900 and 1904.Macrossan (1986) Independently of Larmor, also Lorentz (1899) extended his transformation for second order terms and noted a (mathematical) time dilation effect as well. Other physicists besides Lorentz and Larmor also tried to develop a consistent model of electrodynamics. For example, Emil Cohn (1900, 1901) created an alternative electrodynamics in which he, as one of the first, discarded the existence of the aether (at least in the previous form) and would use, like Ernst Mach, the fixed stars as a reference frame instead. Due to inconsistencies within his theory, like different light speeds in different directions, it was superseded by Lorentz's and Einstein's.Janssen/Stachel (2004), 31‚Äì32 =Electromagnetic mass= During his development of Maxwell's Theory, J. J. Thomson (1881) recognized that charged bodies are harder to set in motion than uncharged bodies. Electrostatic fields behave as if they add an \\"electromagnetic mass\\" to the mechanical mass of the bodies. I.e., according to Thomson, electromagnetic energy corresponds to a certain mass. This was interpreted as some form of self-inductance of the electromagnetic field.Miller (1981), 46Whittaker (1951), 306ff; (1953) 51f He also noticed that the mass of a body in motion is increased by a constant quantity. Thomson's work was continued and perfected by FitzGerald, Heaviside (1888), and George Frederick Charles Searle (1896, 1897). For the electromagnetic mass they gave ‚Äî in modern notation ‚Äî the formula \\\\scriptstyle{m=(4/3)E/c^2}, where \\\\scriptstyle{m} is the electromagnetic mass and \\\\scriptstyle{E} is the electromagnetic energy. Heaviside and Searle also recognized that the increase of the mass of a body is not constant and varies with its velocity. Consequently, Searle noted the impossibility of superluminal velocities, because infinite energy would be needed to exceed the speed of light. Also for Lorentz (1899), the integration of the speed- dependence of masses recognized by Thomson was especially important. He noticed that the mass not only varied due to speed, but is also dependent on the direction, and he introduced what Abraham later called \\"longitudinal\\" and \\"transverse\\" mass. (The transverse mass corresponds to what later was called relativistic mass.Janssen (1995), Ch. 3.4) Wilhelm Wien (1900) assumed (following the works of Thomson, Heaviside, and Searle) that the entire mass is of electromagnetic origin, which was formulated in the context that all forces of nature are electromagnetic ones (the \\"Electromagnetic World View\\"). Wien stated that, if it is assumed that gravitation is an electromagnetic effect too, then there has to be a proportionality between electromagnetic energy, inertial mass and gravitational mass.Miller (1981), 46, 103 In the same paper Henri Poincar√© (1900b) found another way of combining the concepts of mass and energy. He recognized that electromagnetic energy behaves like a fictitious fluid with mass density of \\\\scriptstyle{m=E/c^2} (or \\\\scriptstyle{E=mc^2}) and defined a fictitious electromagnetic momentum as well. However, he arrived at a radiation paradox which was fully explained by Einstein in 1905.Darrigol (2005), 18‚Äì21 Walter Kaufmann (1901‚Äì1903) was the first to confirm the velocity dependence of electromagnetic mass by analyzing the ratio \\\\scriptstyle{e/m} (where \\\\scriptstyle{e} is the charge and \\\\scriptstyle{m} the mass) of cathode rays. He found that the value of \\\\scriptstyle{e/m} decreased with the speed, showing that, assuming the charge constant, the mass of the electron increased with the speed. He also believed that those experiments confirmed the assumption of Wien, that there is no \\"real\\" mechanical mass, but only the \\"apparent\\" electromagnetic mass, or in other words, the mass of all bodies is of electromagnetic origin.Miller (1981), 47‚Äì54 Max Abraham (1902‚Äì1904), who was a supporter of the electromagnetic world view, quickly offered an explanation for Kaufmann's experiments by deriving expressions for the electromagnetic mass. Together with this concept, Abraham introduced (like Poincar√© in 1900) the notion of \\"electromagnetic momentum\\" which is proportional to \\\\scriptstyle{E/c^2}. But unlike the fictitious quantities introduced by Poincar√©, he considered it as a real physical entity. Abraham also noted (like Lorentz in 1899) that this mass also depends on the direction and coined the names \\"longitudinal\\" and \\"transverse\\" mass. In contrast to Lorentz, he did not incorporate the contraction hypothesis into his theory, and therefore his mass terms differed from those of Lorentz.Miller (1981), 61‚Äì67 Based on the preceding work on electromagnetic mass, Friedrich Hasen√∂hrl suggested that part of the mass of a body (which he called apparent mass) can be thought of as radiation bouncing around a cavity. The \\"apparent mass\\" of radiation depends on the temperature (because every heated body emits radiation) and is proportional to its energy. Hasen√∂hrl stated that this energy-apparent-mass relation only holds as long as the body radiates, i.e., if the temperature of a body is greater than 0 K. At first he gave the expression \\\\scriptstyle{m=(8/3)E/c^2} for the apparent mass; however, Abraham and Hasen√∂hrl himself in 1905 changed the result to \\\\scriptstyle{m=(4/3)E/c^2}, the same value as for the electromagnetic mass for a body at rest.Miller (1981), 359‚Äì360 =Absolute space and time= Some scientists and philosophers of science were critical of Newton's definitions of absolute space and time.Lange (1886)Giulini (2001), Ch. 4DiSalle (2002) Ernst Mach (1883) argued that absolute time and space are essentially metaphysical concepts and thus scientifically meaningless, and suggested that only relative motion between material bodies is a useful concept in physics. Mach argued that even effects that according to Newton depend on accelerated motion with respect to absolute space, such as rotation, could be described purely with reference to material bodies, and that the inertial effects cited by Newton in support of absolute space might instead be related purely to acceleration with respect to the fixed stars. Carl Neumann (1870) introduced a \\"Body alpha\\", which represents some sort of rigid and fixed body for defining inertial motion. Based on the definition of Neumann, Heinrich Streintz (1883) argued that in a coordinate system where gyroscopes do not measure any signs of rotation inertial motion is related to a \\"Fundamental body\\" and a \\"Fundamental Coordinate System\\". Eventually, Ludwig Lange (1885) was the first to coin the expression inertial frame of reference and \\"inertial time scale\\" as operational replacements for absolute space and time; he defined \\"inertial frame\\" as \\"a reference frame in which a mass point thrown from the same point in three different (non-co-planar) directions follows rectilinear paths each time it is thrown\\". In 1902, Henri Poincar√© published a collection of essays titled Science and Hypothesis, which included: detailed philosophical discussions on the relativity of space, time, and on the conventionality of distant simultaneity; the conjecture that a violation of the relativity principle can never be detected; the possible non-existence of the aether, together with some arguments supporting the aether; and many remarks on non- Euclidean vs. Euclidean geometry. There were also some attempts to use time as a fourth dimension.Goenner (2008)Archibald (1914) This was done as early as 1754 by Jean le Rond d'Alembert in the Encyclop√©die, and by some authors in the 19th century like H. G. Wells in his novel The Time Machine (1895). In 1901 a philosophical model was developed by Menyh√©rt Pal√°gyi, in which space and time were only two sides of some sort of \\"spacetime\\".Boyce Gibson (1928) He used time as an imaginary fourth dimension, which he gave the form \\\\scriptstyle{it} (where \\\\scriptstyle{i=\\\\sqrt{-1}}, i.e. imaginary number). However, Palagyi's time coordinate is not connected to the speed of light. He also rejected any connection with the existing constructions of n-dimensional spaces and non-Euclidean geometry, so his philosophical model bears only little resemblance with spacetime physics, as it was later developed by Minkowski.Hentschel (1990), 153f. =Light constancy and the principle of relative motion= Henri Poincar√© In the second half of the 19th century, there were many attempts to develop a worldwide clock network synchronized by electrical signals. For that endeavor, the finite propagation speed of light had to be considered, because synchronization signals could travel no faster than the speed of light. In his paper The Measure of Time (1898), Henri Poincar√© described some important consequences of this process and explained that astronomers, in determining the speed of light, simply assumed that light has a constant speed and that this speed is the same in all directions. Without this postulate, it would be impossible to infer the speed of light from astronomical observations, as Ole R√∏mer did based on observations of the moons of Jupiter. Poincar√© also noted that the propagation speed of light can be (and in practice often is) used to define simultaneity between spatially separate events: > The simultaneity of two events, or the order of their succession, the > equality of two durations, are to be so defined that the enunciation of the > natural laws may be as simple as possible. In other words, all these rules, > all these definitions are only the fruit of an unconscious > opportunism.Galison (2003) In some other papers (1895, 1900b), Poincar√© argued that experiments like that of Michelson and Morley show the impossibility of detecting the absolute motion of matter, i.e., the relative motion of matter in relation to the aether. He called this the \\"principle of relative motion\\".Katzir (2005), 272‚Äì275 In the same year, he interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of a synchronization procedure based on light signals. He assumed that two observers who are moving in the aether synchronize their clocks by optical signals. Since they believe themselves to be at rest, they consider only the transmission time of the signals and then cross-reference their observations to examine whether their clocks are synchronous. From the point of view of an observer at rest in the aether, the clocks are not synchronous and indicate the local time \\\\scriptstyle{t'=t-{vx}/{c^2}}, but the moving observers fail to recognize this because they are unaware of their movement. So, contrary to Lorentz, Poincar√©-defined local time can be measured and indicated by clocks.Darrigol (2005), 10‚Äì11 Therefore, in his recommendation of Lorentz for the Nobel Prize in 1902, Poincar√© argued that Lorentz had convincingly explained the negative outcome of the aether drift experiments by inventing the \\"diminished\\" or \\"local\\" time, i.e. a time coordinate in which two events at different places could appear as simultaneous, although they are not simultaneous in reality.Galison (2002), Ch. 4 ‚Äì Etherial Time Like Poincar√©, Alfred Bucherer (1903) believed in the validity of the relativity principle within the domain of electrodynamics, but contrary to Poincar√©, Bucherer even assumed that this implies the nonexistence of the aether. However, the theory that he created later in 1906 was incorrect and not self-consistent, and the Lorentz transformation was absent within his theory as well.Darrigol (2000), 369‚Äì372 =Lorentz's 1904 model= In his paper Electromagnetic phenomena in a system moving with any velocity smaller than that of light, Lorentz (1904) was following the suggestion of Poincar√© and attempted to create a formulation of electrodynamics, which explains the failure of all known aether drift experiments, i.e. the validity of the relativity principle. He tried to prove the applicability of the Lorentz transformation for all orders, although he did not succeed completely. Like Wien and Abraham, he argued that there exists only electromagnetic mass, not mechanical mass, and derived the correct expression for longitudinal and transverse mass, which were in agreement with Kaufmann's experiments (even though those experiments were not precise enough to distinguish between the theories of Lorentz and Abraham). And using the electromagnetic momentum, he could explain the negative result of the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment, in which a charged parallel-plate capacitor moving through the aether should orient itself perpendicular to the motion. Also the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace could be explained. Another important step was the postulate that the Lorentz transformation has to be valid for non- electrical forces as well.Janssen (1995), Ch. 3.3, 3.4 At the same time, when Lorentz worked out his theory, Wien (1903) recognized an important consequence of the velocity dependence of mass. He argued that superluminal velocities were impossible, because that would require an infinite amount of energy ‚Äî the same was already noted by Thomson (1893) and Searle (1897). And in June 1904, after he had read Lorentz's 1904 paper, he noticed the same in relation to length contraction, because at superluminal velocities the factor \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\sqrt{1-{v^2}/{c^2}}} becomes imaginary.Miller (1981), Chap. 1, Footnote 57 Lorentz's theory was criticized by Abraham, who demonstrated that on one side the theory obeys the relativity principle, and on the other side the electromagnetic origin of all forces is assumed. Abraham showed, that both assumptions were incompatible, because in Lorentz's theory of the contracted electrons, non-electric forces were needed in order to guarantee the stability of matter. However, in Abraham's theory of the rigid electron, no such forces were needed. Thus the question arose whether the Electromagnetic conception of the world (compatible with Abraham's theory) or the Relativity Principle (compatible with Lorentz's Theory) was correct.Miller (1981), 75ff In a September 1904 lecture in St. Louis named The Principles of Mathematical Physics, Poincar√© drew some consequences from Lorentz's theory and defined (in modification of Galileo's Relativity Principle and Lorentz's Theorem of Corresponding States) the following principle: \\"The Principle of Relativity, according to which the laws of physical phenomena must be the same for a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, so that we have no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion.\\" He also specified his clock synchronization method and explained the possibility of a \\"new method\\" or \\"new mechanics\\", in which no velocity can surpass that of light for all observers. However, he critically noted that the relativity principle, Newton's action and reaction, the conservation of mass, and the conservation of energy are not fully established and are even threatened by some experiments.Katzir (2005), 275‚Äì277 Also Emil Cohn (1904) continued to develop his alternative model (as described above), and while comparing his theory with that of Lorentz, he discovered some important physical interpretations of the Lorentz transformations. He illustrated (like Joseph Larmor in the same year) this transformation by using rods and clocks: If they are at rest in the aether, they indicate the true length and time, and if they are moving, they indicate contracted and dilated values. Like Poincar√©, Cohn defined local time as the time that is based on the assumption of isotropic propagation of light. Contrary to Lorentz and Poincar√© it was noticed by Cohn, that within Lorentz's theory the separation of \\"real\\" and \\"apparent\\" coordinates is artificial, because no experiment can distinguish between them. Yet according to Cohn's own theory, the Lorentz transformed quantities would only be valid for optical phenomena, while mechanical clocks would indicate the \\"real\\" time. =Poincar√©'s dynamics of the electron= On June 5, 1905, Henri Poincar√© submitted the summary of a work which closed the existing gaps of Lorentz's work. (This short paper contained the results of a more complete work which would be published later, in January 1906.) He showed that Lorentz's equations of electrodynamics were not fully Lorentz-covariant. So he pointed out the group characteristics of the transformation, and he corrected Lorentz's formulas for the transformations of charge density and current density (which implicitly contained the relativistic velocity-addition formula, which he elaborated in May in a letter to Lorentz). Poincar√© used for the first time the term \\"Lorentz transformation\\", and he gave the transformations their symmetrical form used to this day. He introduced a non-electrical binding force (the so-called \\"Poincar√© stresses\\") to ensure the stability of the electrons and to explain length contraction. He also sketched a Lorentz- invariant model of gravitation (including gravitational waves) by extending the validity of Lorentz-invariance to non-electrical forces.Miller (1981), 79‚Äì86Katzir (2005), 280‚Äì288 Eventually Poincar√© (independently of Einstein) finished a substantially extended work of his June paper (the so-called \\"Palermo paper\\", received July 23, printed December 14, published January 1906 ). He spoke literally of \\"the postulate of relativity\\". He showed that the transformations are a consequence of the principle of least action and developed the properties of the Poincar√© stresses. He demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called the Lorentz group, and he showed that the combination \\\\scriptstyle{x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2t^2} is invariant. While elaborating his gravitational theory, he said the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin, by introducing \\\\scriptstyle{ct\\\\sqrt{-1}} as a fourth imaginary coordinate (contrary to Palagyi, he included the speed of light), and he already used four-vectors. He wrote that the discovery of magneto-cathode rays by Paul Ulrich Villard (1904) seemed to threaten the entire theory of Lorentz, but this problem was quickly solved.Walter (2007), Ch. 1 However, although in his philosophical writings Poincar√© rejected the ideas of absolute space and time, in his physical papers he continued to refer to an (undetectable) aether. He also continued (1900b, 1904, 1906, 1908b) to describe coordinates and phenomena as local/apparent (for moving observers) and true/real (for observers at rest in the aether).Miller (1981), 216‚Äì217 So, with a few exceptions,Whittaker (1953), 27‚Äì77Zahar (1989), 149‚Äì200Logunov (2004)Messager, et al. (2012) most historians of science argue that Poincar√© did not invent what is now called special relativity, although it is admitted that Poincar√© anticipated much of Einstein's methods and terminology.Holton (1973/1988), 196‚Äì206Miller (1981)Pais (1982), 126‚Äì128Hentschel (1990), 3‚Äì13Darrigol (2005), 15‚Äì18Katzir (2005), 286‚Äì288 Special relativity =Einstein 1905= Electrodynamics of moving bodies Albert Einstein, 1921 On September 26, 1905 (received June 30), Albert Einstein published his annus mirabilis paper on what is now called special relativity. Einstein's paper includes a fundamental new definition of space and time (all time and space coordinates in all reference frames are on an equal footing, so there is no physical basis for distinguishing \\"true\\" from \\"apparent\\" time) and makes the aether an unnecessary concept, at least in regard to inertial motion. Einstein identified two fundamental principles, the principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of light (light principle), which served as the axiomatic basis of his theory. To better understand Einstein's step, a summary of the situation before 1905, as it was described above, shall be givenWhittaker (1951) (it must be remarked that Einstein was familiar with the 1895 theory of Lorentz, and Science and Hypothesis by Poincar√©, but not their papers of 1904-1905): :a) Maxwell's electrodynamics, as presented by Lorentz in 1895, was the most successful theory at this time. Here, the speed of light is constant in all directions in the stationary aether and completely independent of the velocity of the source; :b) The inability to find an absolute state of motion, i.e. the validity of the relativity principle as the consequence of the negative results of all aether drift experiments and effects like the moving magnet and conductor problem which only depend on relative motion; :c) The Fizeau experiment; :d) The aberration of light; with the following consequences for the speed of light and the theories known at that time: #The speed of light is not composed of the speed of light in vacuum and the velocity of a preferred frame of reference, by b. This contradicts the theory of the (nearly) stationary aether. #The speed of light is not composed of the speed of light in vacuum and the velocity of the light source, by a and c. This contradicts the emission theory. #The speed of light is not composed of the speed of light in vacuum and the velocity of an aether that would be dragged within or in the vicinity of matter, by a, c, and d. This contradicts the hypothesis of the complete aether drag. #The speed of light in moving media is not composed of the speed of light when the medium is at rest and the velocity of the medium, but is determined by Fresnel's dragging coefficient, by c. In order to make the principle of relativity as required by Poincar√© an exact law of nature in the immobile aether theory of Lorentz, the introduction of a variety ad hoc hypotheses was required, such as the contraction hypothesis, local time, the Poincar√© stresses, etc.. This method was criticized by many scholars, since the assumption of a conspiracy of effects which completely prevent the discovery of the aether drift is considered to be very improbable, and it would violate Occam's razor as well.Holton (1988)Pais (1982)Jannssen (1995) Einstein is considered the first who completely dispensed with such auxiliary hypotheses and drew the direct conclusions from the facts stated above:Holton (1988) that the relativity principle is correct and the directly observed speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. Based on his axiomatic approach, Einstein was able to derive all results obtained by his predecessors ‚Äì and in addition the formulas for the relativistic Doppler effect and relativistic aberration ‚Äì in a few pages, while prior to 1905 his competitors had devoted years of long, complicated work to arrive at the same mathematical formalism. Before 1905 Lorentz and Poincar√© had adopted these same principles, as necessary to achieve their final results, but did not recognize that they were also sufficient in the sense that there was no immediate logical need to assume the existence of a stationary aether in order to arrive at the Lorentz transformations.Janssen (1995), Ch. 4 Another reason for Einstein's early rejection of the aether in any form (which he later partially retracted) may have been related to his work on quantum physics. Einstein discovered that light can also be described (at least heuristically) as a kind of particle, so the aether as the medium for electromagnetic \\"waves\\" (which was highly important for Lorentz and Poincar√©) no longer fitted into his conceptual scheme.Rynasiewicz/Renn (2006) It's notable that Einstein's paper contains no direct references to other papers. However, many historians of science like Holton, Miller, Stachel,Stachel (1982) have tried to find out possible influences on Einstein. He stated that his thinking was influenced by the empiricist philosophers David Hume and Ernst Mach. Regarding the Relativity Principle, the moving magnet and conductor problem (possibly after reading a book of August F√∂ppl) and the various negative aether drift experiments were important for him to accept that principle ‚Äî but he denied any significant influence of the most important experiment: the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. Other likely influences include Poincar√©'s Science and Hypothesis, where Poincar√© presented the Principle of Relativity (which, as has been reported by Einstein's friend Maurice Solovine, was closely studied and discussed by Einstein and his friends over a period of years before the publication of Einstein's 1905 paper),Darrigol (2004), 624 and the writings of Max Abraham, from whom he borrowed the terms \\"Maxwell-Hertz equations\\" and \\"longitudinal and transverse mass\\".Miller (1981), 86‚Äì92 Regarding his views on Electrodynamics and the Principle of the Constancy of Light, Einstein stated that Lorentz's theory of 1895 (or the Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics) and also the Fizeau experiment had considerable influence on his thinking. He said in 1909 and 1912 that he borrowed that principle from Lorentz's stationary aether (which implies validity of Maxwell's equations and the constancy of light in the aether frame), but he recognized that this principle together with the principle of relativity makes any reference to an aether unnecessary (at least as to the description of electrodynamics in inertial frames).Born (1956), 193 As he wrote in 1907 and in later papers, the apparent contradiction between those principles can be resolved if it is admitted that Lorentz's local time is not an auxiliary quantity, but can simply be defined as time and is connected with signal velocity. Before Einstein, Poincar√© also developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection with signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to argue that clocks at rest in the stationary aether show the true time, while clocks in inertial motion relative to the aether show only the apparent time. Eventually, near the end of his life in 1953 Einstein described the advantages of his theory over that of Lorentz as follows (although Poincar√© had already stated in 1905 that Lorentz invariance is an exact condition for any physical theory): Mass-energy equivalence Already in ¬ß10 of his paper on electrodynamics, Einstein used the formula :E_{kin}=mc^2\\\\left(\\\\frac1{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2} {c^2}}}-1\\\\right) for the kinetic energy of an electron. In elaboration of this he published a paper (received September 27, November 1905), in which Einstein showed that when a material body lost energy (either radiation or heat) of amount E, its mass decreased by the amount This led to the famous mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula: E = mc2. Einstein considered the equivalency equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that a massive particle possesses an energy, the \\"rest energy\\", distinct from its classical kinetic and potential energies. As it was shown above, many authors before Einstein arrived at similar formulas (including a 4/3-factor) for the relation of mass to energy. However, their work was focused on electromagnetic energy which (as we know today) only represents a small part of the entire energy within matter. So it was Einstein who was the first to: (a) ascribe this relation to all forms of energy, and (b) understand the connection of Mass-energy equivalence with the relativity principle. =Early reception= First assessments Walter Kaufmann (1905, 1906) was probably the first who referred to Einstein's work. He compared the theories of Lorentz and Einstein and, although he said Einstein's method is to be preferred, he argued that both theories are observationally equivalent. Therefore, he spoke of the relativity principle as the \\"Lorentz-Einsteinian\\" basic assumption.Miller (1981), 334‚Äì352 Shortly afterwards, Max Planck (1906a) was the first who publicly defended the theory and interested his students, Max von Laue and Kurd von Mosengeil, in this formulation. He described Einstein's theory as a \\"generalization\\" of Lorentz's theory and, to this \\"Lorentz-Einstein-Theory\\", he gave the name \\"relative theory\\"; while Alfred Bucherer changed Planck's nomenclature into the now common \\"theory of relativity\\" (\\"Einsteinsche Relativit√§tstheorie\\"). On the other hand, Einstein himself and many others continued to refer simply to the new method as the \\"relativity principle\\". And in an important overview article on the relativity principle (1908a), Einstein described SR as a \\"union of Lorentz's theory and the relativity principle\\", including the fundamental assumption that Lorentz's local time can be described as real time. (Yet, Poincar√©'s contributions were rarely mentioned in the first years after 1905.) All of those expressions, (Lorentz-Einstein theory, relativity principle, relativity theory) were used by different physicists alternately in the next years.Miller (1981), 88 Following Planck, other German physicists quickly became interested in relativity, including Arnold Sommerfeld, Wilhelm Wien, Max Born, Paul Ehrenfest, and Alfred Bucherer.Brush, Stephen G., \\"Early Reception of Relativity\\", Why was Relativity Accepted?\\" pp. 192-195, Phys. Perspect., 1, Birkha√ºser Verlag, Basel, 1999 1422‚Äì6944/99/020184‚Äì31. Retrieved 6 April 2019. von Laue, who learned about the theory from Planck, published the first definitive monograph on relativity in 1911.Max Laue, Das Relatitit√§tsprinzip (Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1911; second edition 1913); later editions published under the title Die Relatitit√§tstheorie. By 1911, Sommerfeld altered his plan to speak about relativity at the Solvay Congress because the theory was already considered well established. Kaufmann- Bucherer experiments Kaufmann (1905, 1906) announced the results of his new experiments on the charge-to-mass ratio, i.e. the velocity dependence of mass. They represented, in his opinion, a clear refutation of the relativity principle and the Lorentz-Einstein-Theory, and a confirmation of Abraham's theory. For some years Kaufmann's experiments represented a weighty objection against the relativity principle, although it was criticized by Planck and Adolf Bestelmeyer (1906). Following Kaufmann other physicists, like Alfred Bucherer (1908) and G√ºnther Neumann (1914), also examined the velocity- dependence of mass and this time it was thought that the \\"Lorentz-Einstein theory\\" and the relativity principle were confirmed, and Abraham's theory disproved. However, it was later pointed out that the Kaufmann‚ÄìBucherer‚ÄìNeumann experiments only showed a qualitative mass increase of moving electrons, but they were not precise enough to distinguish between the models of Lorentz-Einstein and Abraham. So it continued until 1940, when experiments of this kind were repeated with sufficient accuracy for confirming the Lorentz-Einstein formula. However, this problem occurred only with this kind of experiment. The investigations of the fine structure of the hydrogen lines already in 1917 provided a clear confirmation of the Lorentz-Einstein formula and the refutation of Abraham's theory.Pauli (1921), 636‚Äì637 Relativistic momentum and mass Max Planck Planck (1906a) defined the relativistic momentum and gave the correct values for the longitudinal and transverse mass by correcting a slight mistake of the expression given by Einstein in 1905. Planck's expressions were in principle equivalent to those used by Lorentz in 1899.Miller (1981), 329‚Äì330 Based on the work of Planck, the concept of relativistic mass was developed by Gilbert Newton Lewis and Richard C. Tolman (1908, 1909) by defining mass as the ratio of momentum to velocity. So the older definition of longitudinal and transverse mass, in which mass was defined as the ratio of force to acceleration, became superfluous. Finally, Tolman (1912) interpreted relativistic mass simply as the mass of the body.Pauli (1921), 634‚Äì636 However, many modern textbooks on relativity do not use the concept of relativistic mass anymore, and mass in special relativity is considered as an invariant quantity. Mass and energy Einstein (1906) showed that the inertia of energy (mass-energy- equivalence) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the conservation of the center of mass theorem. On that occasion, he noted that the formal mathematical content of Poincar√© paper on the center of mass (1900b) and his own paper were mainly the same, although the physical interpretation was different in light of relativity. Kurd von Mosengeil (1906) by extending Hasen√∂hrl's calculation of black-body-radiation in a cavity, derived the same expression for the additional mass of a body due to electromagnetic radiation as Hasen√∂hrl. Hasen√∂hrl's idea was that the mass of bodies included a contribution from the electromagnetic field, he imagined a body as a cavity containing light. His relationship between mass and energy, like all other pre-Einstein ones, contained incorrect numerical prefactors (see Electromagnetic mass). Eventually Planck (1907) derived the mass-energy- equivalence in general within the framework of special relativity, including the binding forces within matter. He acknowledged the priority of Einstein's 1905 work on E=mc^2, but Planck judged his own approach as more general than Einstein's.Miller (1981), 359‚Äì367 Experiments by Fizeau and Sagnac As was explained above, already in 1895 Lorentz succeeded in deriving Fresnel's dragging coefficient (to first order of v/c) and the Fizeau experiment by using the electromagnetic theory and the concept of local time. After first attempts by Jakob Laub (1907) to create a relativistic \\"optics of moving bodies\\", it was Max von Laue (1907) who derived the coefficient for terms of all orders by using the colinear case of the relativistic velocity addition law. In addition, Laue's calculation was much simpler than the complicated methods used by Lorentz. In 1911 Laue also discussed a situation where on a platform a beam of light is split and the two beams are made to follow a trajectory in opposite directions. On return to the point of entry the light is allowed to exit the platform in such a way that an interference pattern is obtained. Laue calculated a displacement of the interference pattern if the platform is in rotation ‚Äì because the speed of light is independent of the velocity of the source, so one beam has covered less distance than the other beam. An experiment of this kind was performed by Georges Sagnac in 1913, who actually measured a displacement of the interference pattern (Sagnac effect). While Sagnac himself concluded that his theory confirmed the theory of an aether at rest, Laue's earlier calculation showed that it is compatible with special relativity as well because in both theories the speed of light is independent of the velocity of the source. This effect can be understood as the electromagnetic counterpart of the mechanics of rotation, for example in analogy to a Foucault pendulum.Laue (1921), 25 & 146‚Äì148 Already in 1909‚Äì11, Franz Harress (1912) performed an experiment which can be considered as a synthesis of the experiments of Fizeau and Sagnac. He tried to measure the dragging coefficient within glass. Contrary to Fizeau he used a rotating device so he found the same effect as Sagnac. While Harress himself misunderstood the meaning of the result, it was shown by Laue that the theoretical explanation of Harress' experiment is in accordance with the Sagnac effect.Laue (1921), 25‚Äì26 & 204‚Äì206 Eventually, the Michelson‚ÄìGale‚ÄìPearson experiment (1925, a variation of the Sagnac experiment) indicated the angular velocity of the Earth itself in accordance with special relativity and a resting aether. Relativity of simultaneity The first derivations of relativity of simultaneity by synchronization with light signals were also simplified.Bjerknes (2002) Daniel Frost Comstock (1910) placed an observer in the middle between two clocks A and B. From this observer a signal is sent to both clocks, and in the frame in which A and B are at rest, they synchronously start to run. But from the perspective of a system in which A and B are moving, clock B is first set in motion, and then comes clock A ‚Äì so the clocks are not synchronized. Also Einstein (1917) created a model with an observer in the middle between A and B. However, in his description two signals are sent from A and B to the observer. From the perspective of the frame in which A and B are at rest, the signals are sent at the same time and the observer \\"is hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A.\\" =Spacetime physics= Minkowski's spacetime Hermann Minkowski Poincar√©'s attempt of a four- dimensional reformulation of the new mechanics was not continued by himself, so it was Hermann Minkowski (1907), who worked out the consequences of that notion (other contributions were made by Roberto Marcolongo (1906) and Richard Hargreaves (1908)Walter (1999a), 49). This was based on the work of many mathematicians of the 19th century like Arthur Cayley, Felix Klein, or William Kingdon Clifford, who contributed to group theory, invariant theory and projective geometry, formulating concepts such as the Cayley‚ÄìKlein metric or the hyperboloid model in which the interval x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{4}^{2} and its invariance was defined in terms of hyperbolic geometry.Klein (1910) Using similar methods, Minkowski succeeded in formulating a geometrical interpretation of the Lorentz transformation. He completed, for example, the concept of four vectors; he created the Minkowski diagram for the depiction of space-time; he was the first to use expressions like world line, proper time, Lorentz invariance/covariance, etc.; and most notably he presented a four-dimensional formulation of electrodynamics. Similar to Poincar√© he tried to formulate a Lorentz-invariant law of gravity, but that work was subsequently superseded by Einstein's elaborations on gravitation. In 1907 Minkowski named four predecessors who contributed to the formulation of the relativity principle: Lorentz, Einstein, Poincar√© and Planck. And in his famous lecture Space and Time (1908) he mentioned Voigt, Lorentz and Einstein. Minkowski himself considered Einstein's theory as a generalization of Lorentz's and credited Einstein for completely stating the relativity of time, but he criticized his predecessors for not fully developing the relativity of space. However, modern historians of science argue that Minkowski's claim for priority was unjustified, because Minkowski (like Wien or Abraham) adhered to the electromagnetic world-picture and apparently did not fully understand the difference between Lorentz's electron theory and Einstein's kinematics.Miller (1981), Ch. 7.4.6Walter (1999b), Ch. 3 In 1908, Einstein and Laub rejected the four-dimensional electrodynamics of Minkowski as overly complicated \\"learned superfluousness\\" and published a \\"more elementary\\", non-four-dimensional derivation of the basic-equations for moving bodies. But it was Minkowski's geometric model that (a) showed that the special relativity is a complete and internally self-consistent theory, (b) added the Lorentz invariant proper time interval (which accounts for the actual readings shown by moving clocks), and (c) served as a basis for further development of relativity. Eventually, Einstein (1912) recognized the importance of Minkowski's geometric spacetime model and used it as the basis for his work on the foundations of general relativity. Today special relativity is seen as an application of linear algebra, but at the time special relativity was being developed the field of linear algebra was still in its infancy. There were no textbooks on linear algebra as modern vector space and transformation theory, and the matrix notation of Arthur Cayley (that unifies the subject) had not yet come into widespread use. Cayley's matrix calculus notation was used by Minkowski (1908) in formulating relativistic electrodynamics, even though it was later replaced by Sommerfeld using vector notation.Walter (1999a), 49 & 71 According to a recent source the Lorentz transformations are equivalent to hyperbolic rotations.Catoni, et al. (2011), Page 18 However Varicak (1910) had shown that the standard Lorentz transformation is a translation in hyperbolic space.Variƒáak (1910) The Theory of Relativity and Lobachevskian geometry, see section ¬ß3 \\"Lorentz-Einstein transformation as translation\\" Vector notation and closed systems Minkowski's space-time formalism was quickly accepted and further developed. For example, Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) replaced Minkowski's matrix notation by an elegant vector notation and coined the terms \\"four vector\\" and \\"six vector\\". He also introduced a trigonometric formulation of the relativistic velocity addition rule, which according to Sommerfeld, removes much of the strangeness of that concept. Other important contributions were made by Laue (1911, 1913), who used the spacetime formalism to create a relativistic theory of deformable bodies and an elementary particle theory.Miller (1981), Ch. 12.5.8Janssen/Mecklenburg (2007) He extended Minkowski's expressions for electromagnetic processes to all possible forces and thereby clarified the concept of mass-energy-equivalence. Laue also showed that non-electrical forces are needed to ensure the proper Lorentz transformation properties, and for the stability of matter ‚Äì he could show that the \\"Poincar√© stresses\\" (as mentioned above) are a natural consequence of relativity theory so that the electron can be a closed system. Lorentz transformation without second postulate There were some attempts to derive the Lorentz transformation without the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light. Vladimir Ignatowski (1910) for example used for this purpose (a) the principle of relativity, (b) homogeneity and isotropy of space, and (c) the requirement of reciprocity. Philipp Frank and Hermann Rothe (1911) argued that this derivation is incomplete and needs additional assumptions. Their own calculation was based on the assumptions that: (a) the Lorentz transformation forms a homogeneous linear group, (b) when changing frames, only the sign of the relative speed changes, (c) length contraction solely depends on the relative speed. However, according to Pauli and Miller such models were insufficient to identify the invariant speed in their transformation with the speed of light ‚Äî for example, Ignatowski was forced to seek recourse in electrodynamics to include the speed of light. So Pauli and others argued that both postulates are needed to derive the Lorentz transformation.Pauli (1921), 555‚Äì556Miller (1981), 218‚Äì219 However, until today, others continued the attempts to derive special relativity without the light postulate. Non- euclidean formulations without imaginary time coordinate Minkowski in his earlier works in 1907 and 1908 followed Poincar√© in representing space and time together in complex form (x,y,z,ict) emphasizing the formal similarity with Euclidean space. He noted that space-time is in a certain sense a four- dimensional non-Euclidean manifold.Goettingen lecture 1907, see comments in Walter 1999 Sommerfeld (1910) used Minkowski's complex representation to combine non-collinear velocities by spherical geometry and so derive Einstein's addition formula. Subsequent writers,Walter (1999b) principally Variƒáak, dispensed with the imaginary time coordinate, and wrote in explicitly non-Euclidean (i.e. Lobachevskian) form reformulating relativity using the concept of rapidity previously introduced by Alfred Robb (1911); Edwin Bidwell Wilson and Gilbert N. Lewis (1912) introduced a vector notation for spacetime; √âmile Borel (1913) showed how parallel transport in non-Euclidean space provides the kinematic basis of Thomas precession twelve years before its experimental discovery by Thomas; Felix Klein (1910) and Ludwik Silberstein (1914) employed such methods as well. One historian argues that the non- Euclidean style had little to show \\"in the way of creative power of discovery\\", but it offered notational advantages in some cases, particularly in the law of velocity addition. (So in the years before World War I, the acceptance of the non-Euclidean style was approximately equal to that of the initial spacetime formalism, and it continued to be employed in relativity textbooks of the 20th century.Walter (1999b), 23 Time dilation and twin paradox Einstein (1907a) proposed a method for detecting the transverse Doppler effect as a direct consequence of time dilation. And in fact, that effect was measured in 1938 by Herbert E. Ives and G. R. Stilwell (Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment).Miller (1981), 245‚Äì253 And Lewis and Tolman (1909) described the reciprocity of time dilation by using two light clocks A and B, traveling with a certain relative velocity to each other. The clocks consist of two plane mirrors parallel to one another and to the line of motion. Between the mirrors a light signal is bouncing, and for the observer resting in the same reference frame as A, the period of clock A is the distance between the mirrors divided by the speed of light. But if the observer looks at clock B, he sees that within that clock the signal traces out a longer, angled path, thus clock B is slower than A. However, for the observer moving alongside with B the situation is completely in reverse: Clock B is faster and A is slower. Also Lorentz (1910‚Äì1912) discussed the reciprocity of time dilation and analyzed a clock \\"paradox\\", which apparently occurs as a consequence of the reciprocity of time dilation. Lorentz showed that there is no paradox if one considers that in one system only one clock is used, while in the other system two clocks are necessary, and the relativity of simultaneity is fully taken into account. Max von Laue A similar situation was created by Paul Langevin in 1911 with what was later called the \\"twin paradox\\", where he replaced the clocks by persons (Langevin never used the word \\"twins\\" but his description contained all other features of the paradox). Langevin solved the paradox by alluding to the fact that one twin accelerates and changes direction, so Langevin could show that the symmetry is broken and the accelerated twin is younger. However, Langevin himself interpreted this as a hint as to the existence of an aether. Although Langevin's explanation is still accepted by some, his conclusions regarding the aether were not generally accepted. Laue (1913) pointed out that any acceleration can be made arbitrarily small in relation to the inertial motion of the twin, and that the real explanation is that one twin is at rest in two different inertial frames during his journey, while the other twin is at rest in a single inertial frame. See also extract of page 203 Laue was also the first to analyze the situation based on Minkowski's spacetime model for special relativity ‚Äì showing how the world lines of inertially moving bodies maximize the proper time elapsed between two events.Miller (1981), 257‚Äì264 Acceleration Einstein (1908) tried ‚Äì as a preliminary in the framework of special relativity ‚Äì also to include accelerated frames within the relativity principle. In the course of this attempt he recognized that for any single moment of acceleration of a body one can define an inertial reference frame in which the accelerated body is temporarily at rest. It follows that in accelerated frames defined in this way, the application of the constancy of the speed of light to define simultaneity is restricted to small localities. However, the equivalence principle that was used by Einstein in the course of that investigation, which expresses the equality of inertial and gravitational mass and the equivalence of accelerated frames and homogeneous gravitational fields, transcended the limits of special relativity and resulted in the formulation of general relativity.Pais (2000), 177-183 Nearly simultaneously with Einstein, also Minkowski (1908) considered the special case of uniform accelerations within the framework of his space-time formalism. He recognized that the world-line of such an accelerated body corresponds to a hyperbola. This notion was further developed by Born (1909) and Sommerfeld (1910), with Born introducing the expression \\"hyperbolic motion\\". He noted that uniform acceleration can be used as an approximation for any form of acceleration within special relativity.Pauli (1921), 626-628 In addition, Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham (1910) showed that Maxwell's equations are invariant under a much wider group of transformation than the Lorentz-group, i.e., the spherical wave transformations, being a form of conformal transformations. Under those transformations the equations preserve their form for some types of accelerated motions.Warwick (2003) A general covariant formulation of electrodynamics in Minkowski space was eventually given by Friedrich Kottler (1912), whereby his formulation is also valid for general relativity.Pauli (1921), 704 Concerning the further development of the description of accelerated motion in special relativity, the works by Langevin and others for rotating frames (Born coordinates), and by Wolfgang Rindler and others for uniform accelerated frames (Rindler coordinates) must be mentioned.Rindler (2001) Rigid bodies and Ehrenfest paradox Einstein (1907b) discussed the question of whether, in rigid bodies, as well as in all other cases, the velocity of information can exceed the speed of light, and explained that information could be transmitted under these circumstances into the past, thus causality would be violated. Since this contravenes radically against every experience, superluminal velocities are thought impossible. He added that a dynamics of the rigid body must be created in the framework of SR. Eventually, Max Born (1909) in the course of his above-mentioned work concerning accelerated motion, tried to include the concept of rigid bodies into SR. However, Paul Ehrenfest (1909) showed that Born's concept lead the so-called Ehrenfest paradox, in which, due to length contraction, the circumference of a rotating disk is shortened while the radius stays the same. This question was also considered by Gustav Herglotz (1910), Fritz Noether (1910), and von Laue (1911). It was recognized by Laue that the classic concept is not applicable in SR since a \\"rigid\\" body possesses infinitely many degrees of freedom. Yet, while Born's definition was not applicable on rigid bodies, it was very useful in describing rigid motions of bodies.Pauli (1921), 690‚Äì691 In connection to the Ehrenfest paradox, it was also discussed (by Vladimir Variƒáak and others) whether length contraction is \\"real\\" or \\"apparent\\", and whether there is a difference between the dynamic contraction of Lorentz and the kinematic contraction of Einstein. However, it was rather a dispute over words because, as Einstein said, the kinematic length contraction is \\"apparent\\" for a co- moving observer, but for an observer at rest it is \\"real\\" and the consequences are measurable.Pauli (1921), 556‚Äì557 Acceptance of special relativity Planck, in 1909, compared the implications of the modern relativity principle ‚Äî he particularly referred to the relativity of time ‚Äì with the revolution by the Copernican system.Pais (1982), 11a An important factor in the adoption of special relativity by physicists was its development by Minkowski into a spacetime theory. Consequently, by about 1911, most theoretical physicists accepted special relativity.Miller (1981), Ch. 7.4.12 In 1912 Wilhelm Wien recommended both Lorentz (for the mathematical framework) and Einstein (for reducing it to a simple principle) for the Nobel Prize in Physics ‚Äì although it was decided by the Nobel committee not to award the prize for special relativity.Pais (1982), 7c Only a minority of theoretical physicists such as Abraham, Lorentz, Poincar√©, or Langevin still believed in the existence of an aether. Einstein later (1918‚Äì1920) qualified his position by arguing that one can speak about a relativistic aether, but the \\"idea of motion\\" cannot be applied to it.Kostro (1992) Lorentz and Poincar√© had always argued that motion through the aether was undetectable. Einstein used the expression \\"special theory of relativity\\" in 1915, to distinguish it from general relativity. =Relativistic theories= Gravitation The first attempt to formulate a relativistic theory of gravitation was undertaken by Poincar√© (1905). He tried to modify Newton's law of gravitation so that it assumes a Lorentz- covariant form. He noted that there were many possibilities for a relativistic law, and he discussed two of them. It was shown by Poincar√© that the argument of Pierre-Simon Laplace, who argued that the speed of gravity is many times faster than the speed of light, is not valid within a relativistic theory. That is, in a relativistic theory of gravitation, planetary orbits are stable even when the speed of gravity is equal to that of light. Similar models to that of Poincar√© were discussed by Minkowski (1907b) and Sommerfeld (1910). However, it was shown by Abraham (1912) that those models belong to the class of \\"vector theories\\" of gravitation. The fundamental defect of those theories is that they implicitly contain a negative value for the gravitational energy in the vicinity of matter, which would violate the energy principle. As an alternative, Abraham (1912) and Gustav Mie (1913) proposed different \\"scalar theories\\" of gravitation. While Mie never formulated his theory in a consistent way, Abraham completely gave up the concept of Lorentz-covariance (even locally), and therefore it was irreconcilable with relativity. In addition, all of those models violated the equivalence principle, and Einstein argued that it is impossible to formulate a theory which is both Lorentz- covariant and satisfies the equivalence principle. However, Gunnar Nordstr√∂m (1912, 1913) was able to create a model which fulfilled both conditions. This was achieved by making both the gravitational and the inertial mass dependent on the gravitational potential. Nordstr√∂m's theory of gravitation was remarkable because it was shown by Einstein and Adriaan Fokker (1914), that in this model gravitation can be completely described in terms of space-time curvature. Although Nordstr√∂m's theory is without contradiction, from Einstein's point of view a fundamental problem persisted: It does not fulfill the important condition of general covariance, as in this theory preferred frames of reference can still be formulated. So contrary to those \\"scalar theories\\", Einstein (1911‚Äì1915) developed a \\"tensor theory\\" (i.e. general relativity), which fulfills both the equivalence principle and general covariance. As a consequence, the notion of a complete \\"special relativistic\\" theory of gravitation had to be given up, as in general relativity the constancy of light speed (and Lorentz covariance) is only locally valid. The decision between those models was brought about by Einstein, when he was able to exactly derive the perihelion precession of Mercury, while the other theories gave erroneous results. In addition, only Einstein's theory gave the correct value for the deflection of light near the sun.Norton (2005)Walter (2007) Quantum field theory The need to put together relativity and quantum mechanics was one of the major motivations in the development of quantum field theory. Pascual Jordan and Wolfgang Pauli showed in 1928 that quantum fields could be made to be relativistic, and Paul Dirac produced the Dirac equation for electrons, and in so doing predicted the existence of antimatter.Shapiro (1999) Many other domains have since been reformulated with relativistic treatments: relativistic thermodynamics, relativistic statistical mechanics, relativistic hydrodynamics, relativistic quantum chemistry, relativistic heat conduction, etc. =Experimental evidence= Important early experiments confirming special relativity as mentioned above were the Fizeau experiment, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, the Kaufmann‚ÄìBucherer‚ÄìNeumann experiments, the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment, the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace, and the Trouton‚ÄìRankine experiment. In the 1920s, a series of Michelson‚ÄìMorley type experiments were conducted, confirming relativity to even higher precision than the original experiment. Another type of interferometer experiment was the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment in 1932, by which the independence of the speed of light from the velocity of the apparatus was confirmed. Also time dilation was directly measured in the Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment in 1938 and by measuring the decay rates of moving particles in 1940. All of those experiments have been repeated several times with increased precision. In addition, that the speed of light is unreachable for massive bodies was measured in many tests of relativistic energy and momentum. Therefore, knowledge of those relativistic effects is required in the construction of particle accelerators. In 1962 J. G. Fox pointed out that all previous experimental tests of the constancy of the speed of light were conducted using light which had passed through stationary material: glass, air, or the incomplete vacuum of deep space. As a result, all were thus subject to the effects of the extinction theorem. This implied that the light being measured would have had a velocity different from that of the original source. He concluded that there was likely as yet no acceptable proof of the second postulate of special relativity. This surprising gap in the experimental record was quickly closed in the ensuing years, by experiments by Fox, and by Alvager et al., which used gamma rays sourced from high energy mesons. The high energy levels of the measured photons, along with very careful accounting for extinction effects, eliminated any significant doubt from their results. Many other tests of special relativity have been conducted, testing possible violations of Lorentz invariance in certain variations of quantum gravity. However, no sign of anisotropy of the speed of light has been found even at the 10‚àí17 level, and some experiments even ruled out Lorentz violations at the 10‚àí40 level, see Modern searches for Lorentz violation. =Priority= Some claim that Poincar√© and Lorentz, not Einstein, are the true founders of special relativity. For more see the article on relativity priority dispute. =Criticisms= Some criticized Special Relativity for various reasons, such as lack of empirical evidence, internal inconsistencies, rejection of mathematical physics per se, or philosophical reasons. Although there still are critics of relativity outside the scientific mainstream, the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that Special Relativity has been verified in many different ways and there are no inconsistencies within the theory.

The Anti-Cruelty Society (SPCA of Illinois) is a private, not-for-profit humane society that does not receive government assistance. It is one of the largest such organizations in the United States. The organization offers adoption, veterinarian, and training services.http://anticruelty.org/ It was founded on January 19, 1899 by a group of Chicago residents who had concerns about the treatment of the city's animals, from stray cats and dogs, to workhorses, to livestock.The Anti-Cruelty Society: History of The Anti-Cruelty Society The Anti-Cruelty Society exists to prevent cruelty to animals and to advance humane education. Their mission is building a community of caring by helping pets and educating people. The Anti-Cruelty Society changed its policies to align with the no kill movement, in 2004, turning strays over to Chicago Animal Care and Control.  History  = 1899-1911 = Rosa Fay Thomas founded the Anti- Cruelty Society on January 19, 1899 in Chicago and was elected first acting president, upon the belief that society had an obligation to care and raise awareness for animals living in cruel conditions. Its first shelter for small animals opened in 1904. The Anti-Cruelty Society‚Äôs first campaign to eliminate animal mistreatment/provide better care for animals involved improving the living and working conditions of workhorses in the city of Chicago in 1905. Early goals of the foundation concentrated on endeavors for workhorses, livestock, and small animals. For a short time, in addition to animal welfare, the Anti-Cruelty Society focused its efforts on child welfare cases. In 1906, the State of Illinois allotted a charter to the Anti-Cruelty Society to ensure the welfare of both animal and child welfare. During this time, the Anti- Cruelty Society implemented its first humane education movement to provide basic access to literature and lectures. = 1911-1949 = The demand for services provided by the Anti-Cruelty Society grew exponentially during the Great Depression. The Anti-cruelty society runs only through the funds that are donated to them. The Anti-cruelty society started after Rosa saw the mistreatment of horses. One of their first acts of business was putting up drinking fountains for the horses. = 1950-2000 = In 1976 the Anti-Cruelty Society began the volunteer program that is still open available today. The Anti-Cruelty Society's Mobile Vaccination Clinic began in 1986 offering free exams and vaccinations for cats and dogs to the disadvantaged neighborhoods in Chicago. = 2001-2010 = As of 2004 the Anti-Cruelty Society stopped accepting stray dogs and cats into their shelters. As of 2010 The Anti-Cruelty Society has been using the services provided by Pet Point Data Management System, run by PetHealth. They provide inventory on adoptable cats and dogs which can help keep track of animal populations and facilitates the adoption processes. This service is provided for free to non-profit animal organizations and when an animal is adopted they provide a trackable chip. = 2011-2020 = In 2014, Chicago's Alderman passed the Anti-Puppy Mill Ordinance 49-1, which did not allow dogs, cats and other animals to be sheltered if they came from large-scale breeding operations. This helps to prevent the animals that are in current shelters to be forgotten about; sales on animals made by breeders often get sold in pet shops which leaves animals in shelters, who are usually mixed breeds and older to be overlooked. In February 2019, Tracy Elliott, the Executive Director of Ashville Humane Society, became the new president. In the pandemic of 2020, with a grant from PetSmart Charities, the Anti-Cruelty Society offered supplies of pet food to families affected by Covid-19. The Anti-cruelty Society also expanded the \\"Friends Who Care\\" program to help pet owners receive veterinarian services for their pets. Before Illinois' stay-at-home order in March 2020, the Anti-Cruelty Society urged people to Foster animals because of an influx of pets and a limit of space in the shelters.  Services  = Adoption = The vice president of the Anti-Cruelty Society, Peggy Froh Asseo, listed 6,000 animals that were adopted in 2004. The same year, they also implemented their new \\"no kill\\" policy expecting their number of adoptions to raise up to 8,000. The Anti- Cruelty Society has a yearly event, \\"Clear The Shelter\\", where the adoption fees are waived and all their pets are up to date in vaccines. With the Covid-19 pandemic being expanded through the end of April 2020 the Anti- Cruelty Society moved their adoption services online. = Clinic = The Anti- Cruelty Society's spay/neuter clinic‚Äîone of the highest volume spay/neuter clinics in the country‚Äîperformed over 12,000 surgeries. The Society also found new homes for nearly 6,000 animals.

The site is adjacent to the town of Southport, North Carolina, and to wetlands and woodlands, and was opened in 1975. The site contains two General Electric boiling water reactors, which are cooled by water collected from the Cape Fear River and discharged into the Atlantic Ocean. Duke Energy Progress is the majority owner (81.7%) and operator of the Brunswick nuclear plant. The North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency owns the remaining 18.3%. Duke Energy Progress is currently in the process of buying The North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency's 18.3% Stake at Brunswick nuclear power plant. (Duke Energy completed its merger with Progress Energy on July 2, 2012.) The Brunswick plants' proximity to the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean allowed the designers to take in cooling water from the Cape Fear river and discharge it into the Atlantic off the coast of Oak Island. Fish, crustaceans, and other debris are removed from the cooling water via a filtration system. The water then flows through the nuclear plant and discharges into a five mile long canal which passes under the Intra-Coastal Waterway at one point.

Early life and education Corro was born between 1786 and 1800 (sources vary considerably). Little is known of his early or personal life. He went to law school in Guadalajara before moving to Mexico City and made a name for himself in the capital as a lawyer. He was extremely religious, politically liberal, and a dedicated follower of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Career =Early positions= He was minister of justice and ecclesiastical affairs in the cabinet of President Miguel Barrag√°n from 18 March 1835 to 26 February 1836. Barrag√°n had become interim president in the absence of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, who was fighting rebels in Zacatecas. Barrag√°n, however, died of typhus on 1 March 1836, just after resigning office on 27 February due to ill health, with Santa Anna again absent from the capital (this time fighting rebels in Texas). Under those circumstances, the Chamber of Deputies on 27 February 1836 named Corro interim president. He formally took office on 2 March. =As president= Corro served until 19 April 1837. During his term of office, Santa Anna was defeated and taken prisoner in Texas; Mexican forces retreated from Texas, in effect conceding the loss of the province; charges were brought against General Vicente Filisola for having obeyed the orders of Santa Anna to abandon Texas (to save Santa Anna's life). Also, diplomatic relations were suspended with the United States. As an economy measure, the government introduced new, debased 1¬Ω- and 3-cents coins, resulting in riots. President Corro ordered Masses said for the release of Santa Anna. He also took unsuccessful steps to continue the war with the Texas rebels and suppress the rebellion. These efforts were unpopular. When Santa Anna was finally released, he returned to his hacienda, without anyone holding him accountable for his actions. A major accomplishment was that Corro negotiated with Pope Gregory XVI and obtained recognition of Mexico's independence. The treasury was depleted, and the country was disorganized and demoralized because of the war in Texas and other reasons. The clergy had great influence, both within and outside of the government. The most important event of Corro's administration, however, was the promulgation by Congress on 30 December 1836 of the Siete Leyes Constitucionales (the \\"Seven Laws\\"), in effect a new constitution centralizing the government in the capital, at the expense of the states. The Siete Leyes replaced the federalist Constitution of 1824. They abrogated universal male suffrage and imposed a literacy test for voting. In March 1837 French admiral Brotounier brought a diplomatic message about French claims against Mexico, threatening to break diplomatic relations. Corro was said to be excessively religious, timid, vacillating, and with little energy and no military skills. His government was so devoted to religious practices that he was nicknamed \\"the saint\\". Having lost the support of all the political parties, in 1837 Corro called elections. On 19 April of that year, he turned over the government to General Anastasio Bustamante (his second term) and retired to private life in Guadalajara. He died there in 1864, during the French Intervention in Mexico, and was interred in the main cemetery of the city, the Pante√≥n de Bel√©n.

It is based on an alphabet Zapf originally penned in 1944. As a font, it makes extensive use of ligatures and character variations (for example, the lower case letter d has nine variations). History In 1983, Zapf had completed the typeface AMS Euler with Donald Knuth and David Siegel of Stanford University for the American Mathematical Society, a typeface for mathematical composition including fraktur and Greek letters. David Siegel had recently finished his studies at Stanford and was interested in entering the field of typography. He told Zapf his idea of making a typeface with a large number of glyph variations; he wanted to start with an example of Zapf's calligraphy that was reproduced in a publication by the Society of Typographical Arts in Chicago. Zapf was concerned that this was the wrong way to go, and while he was interested in creating a complicated program, he was worried about starting something new. However, Zapf remembered a page of calligraphy from his sketchbook from 1944, and considered the possibility of making a typeface from it. He had previously tried to create a calligraphic typeface for Stempel in 1948, but hot metal composition was too limiting on the freedom of swash characters. Such a result could only be achieved using modern digital technology, and so Zapf and Siegel began work on the complicated software necessary. Siegel also hired Gino Lee, a type designer from Boston, Massachusetts, to render the extensive character set. (The \\"ino\\" in \\"Zapfino\\" refers to Gino.) However, just before the project was completed, Siegel wrote a letter to Zapf, saying that his girlfriend had left him and that he had lost all interest in anything. Siegel abandoned the project and started a new life, working on bringing color to Macintosh computers and later becoming an Internet design expert. Zapfino's development had become seriously delayed, until Zapf presented the project to Linotype. They were prepared to complete it and reorganized the project. Zapf worked with Linotype to create four alphabets and various ornaments, flourishes, and other dingbats. Zapfino was released in 1998 as a Type 1 font. Availability Apple Inc. includes Zapfino in macOS and iOS, partly to demonstrate its advanced typographic features. The font includes over 1,400 glyphs as of the most recent version, and contains much bigger letters than the Zapfino fonts Linotype sells in retail channel. Since then, Linotype has extended Zapfino to include an additional Forte weight in their Zapfino Extra family which Apple has not licensed for distribution with macOS. Zapfino Extra (2003) In 2003, Hermann Zapf completely reworked the Zapfino design, creating Zapfino Extra, a large expansion of the Zapfino family designed in close collaboration with Akira Kobayashi. This font family uses Apple Advanced Typography and OpenType technologies, allowing automatic ligatures and contextual glyph substitutions, accurately reflecting the fluid and dynamic nature of Zapf's calligraphy. This font family comes in 2 font weights, with 3 fonts in Forte weight and total of 12 fonts in the family. The Pro fonts contain glyphs found in other fonts of their respective weights. =Zapfino Extra W1G (2010)= It is a version Zapfino Extra with support of Greek and Cyrillic characters. The family includes Zapfino Extra Paneuropean W1G One font. OpenType features include access all alternates, fractions, standard ligatures, localized forms, ordinals, scientific inferiors, superscript/subscript, discretionary ligatures. =Zapfino Extra Cyrillic One (2010)= It is a subset of Zapfino Extra Paneuropean W1G One font with only support of Cyrillic characters.International typography gets a Cyrillic boost Additional OpenType features include ornaments. Zapfino Extra X (2003) Linotype also created Zapfino Extra X, which was based on the 1998 Zapfino fonts included with Mac OS X. This font family, like the Zapfino in Mac OS X, features letters four times larger than the Linotype counterpart. Zapfino Arabic (2014‚Äì2015) Designed by Nadine Chahine of Monotype Imaging, it is an Arabic version of Zapfino combining Naskh and Nastaaliq calligraphic styles. The character proportions refer to Naskh manuscript traditions but the isolated and final forms bring with them an exaggerated swash-like movement that references the extravagant ascenders and descenders of Zapfino. Work on Zapfino Arabic started in the summer of 2012, and after a meeting with Hermann Zapf in Darmstadt in August to look at early sketches, the project was approved and ready to start.Zapfino Arabic: a decade of collaboration between Hermann Zapf and Nadine ChahineZapfino Arabic: A Typeface in the Making The family includes only 1 font in regular weight, with font leaning right as the original Zapfino fonts designed by Hermann Zapf. OpenType features include 10 stylistic sets.

In 1976, the Canadian government signed the United Nations' International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. This promised free education at all levels. However, in 1995, the Liberal Government announced a $7 billion funding cut to provincial programs, which includes tuition. Between this time, it was decided by Canadian government and education officials that free education was not feasible, and that to provide free education would mean providing nothing else for its citizens. In 1996, it was announced that over a period of four years, tuition was going to be raised $280 from its current $500 rate. Students organized themselves into student unions, and fought against this increase by protesting in the streets. There were also several 'walk-outs' performed by high school students. As a result of these protests, the tuition freeze remained in effect. However, a $500 penalty was placed on students who failed more than five classes.

In modern Japanese, principally refers to kanji used to phonetically represent native or borrowed words with less regard to the underlying meaning of the characters. This is similar to in Old Japanese. Conversely, also refers to kanji used semantically without regard to the readings. For example, the word sushi is often written with its . Though the two characters have the readings and respectively, the character means \\"one's natural life span\\" and means \\"to administer\\", neither of which has anything to do with the food. as a means of representing loanwords has been largely superseded in modern Japanese by the use of (see also Transcription into Japanese), although many coined in earlier eras still linger on.  Usage  Ateji today are used conventionally for certain words, such as (sushi), though these words may be written in hiragana (especially for native words), or katakana (especially for borrowed words), with preference depending on the particular word, context, and choice of the writer. Ateji are particularly common on traditional store signs and menus. For example, tempura may be written as . The Japanese loanword for \\"coffee\\" is generally written using the katakana , but on coffee shop signs and menus it may be written with the Chinese word , which is then pronounced irregularly to their normal kun'yomi. Many characters have gained meanings derived from ateji usage. For example, ateji was once widely utilized for foreign place names; such as in the ateji used to write \\"Asia\\". The original ateji word is now considered archaic, but the character ‰∫ú has gained the meaning \\"Asia\\" in such compounds as , even though ‰∫ú originally meant \\"subsequent\\" (and continues to). From the ateji , the second character was taken, resulting in the semi-formal coinage , which literally translates to \\"rice country\\" but means \\"United States of America\\"; however, remains in far more common use in modern Japanese. Major natural gas companies in Japan use the ateji in their company names, but use the katakana „Ç¨„Çπ in their trade names.  Phono-semantic matching  When using ateji to represent loanwords, the kanji are sometimes chosen for both their semantic and phonetic values, a form of phono-semantic matching. A stock example is (kurabu) for \\"club\\", where the characters can be interpreted loosely in sequence as \\"together\\", \\"fun\\" and \\"place\\". Another example is (kappa) for the Portuguese capa, a kind of raincoat. The characters can mean \\"wings coming together\\", as the pointed capa resembles a bird with wings folded together.  History  The ad hoc usage of Chinese characters for their phonetic values dates nearly to the introduction of Chinese characters to Japan. Two widespread uses of ateji came out of this. On one front, scholars and monks used kanji characters as translation aids between the lines of Chinese texts. On the other, poets simply used kanji phonetically to write in Japanese. Many different characters were used with the same sound values. This system of characters is called (man'y≈çgana, \\"alphabet of myriad leaves\\"). The kana of modern Japanese (hiragana and katakana) developed as organic simplifications of man'y≈çgana that were eventually codified. Ateji are primarily used today for historical terms ‚Äì in historical order, these are primarily Sanskrit terms dating from the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, Portuguese terms from the 16th and 17th centuries, and Dutch terms from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries ‚Äì see Japanese words of Portuguese origin and Japanese words of Dutch origin. Ateji found some use in the Meiji era and in the 20th century, but has largely been superseded by katakana. = Sanskrit = In Buddhist Japanese, Sanskrit terms used in some chants also derive from ateji but were not called such. These Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese (in a Literary Chinese style) in China long ago. The translation rule for mantras was not to translate the mantra, but instead to represent it phonetically with Chinese characters. For the sutras, they were translated into Chinese Literary Language (Wenyan). The terms and , or \\"perfection of wisdom\\" and \\"fully enlightened\\", both appear in the Heart Sutra, but are written using ateji.  Related concepts  (kun-yomi, or \\"Japanese-origin\\" reading) should not be confused with ateji. Whereas ateji are characters used to represent Japanese or borrowed words without regard to the meaning of those characters, kun'yomi are readings, typically words, of Japanese origin that have been officially applied to the borrowed Chinese characters. (This can be related to Latin- Germanic origin synonyms in English.) When a native Japanese word is written as a compound by meaning only, and this spelling is established in the language, as in , the word is the semantic variety of ateji, and is known specifically as (jukujikun, \\"established meaning-spellings\\"). Intentional improvised use of irregular kanji spellings (as opposed to spelling mistakes) is known as (gikun) and generally requires furigana (notational reading characters) to be read properly. Many jukujikun (established meaning- spellings) may have started out as gikun (improvised meaning-spellings). A loanword example is reading (', \\"mortal enemy\\") as the English-derived word ' \\"rival\\". While standardized ateji uses okurigana, as in (kawai-i) having the so that it can inflect as (kawai-katta) for the past tense, gikun that is only intended for one-off usage need not have sufficient okurigana. For example, (kara-i, \\"spicy, salty\\") is an adjective and requires an , but it might be spelt for example as (ka-rai, both legitimate on readings of the characters) on a poster, for example, where there is no intention of inflecting this spelling. = Single-character loan words = Most ateji are multi-character, but in rare cases they can be single-character, as in Áº∂ kan (simplification of , for which kan is the Chinese-derived pronunciation), used for \\"can, metal tin\\" ( originally means \\"metal pot, iron teakettle\\", so this is similar). This is classified as ateji. In some rare cases, an individual kanji has a loan word reading ‚Äì that is, a character is given a new reading by borrowing a foreign word ‚Äì though most often these words are written in katakana. The three most notable examples are , , and . and are marginally understood or used in some settings, but most are obscure ‚Äì see list of single character loan words for more. These are classed as kun'yomi of a single character, because the character is being used for meaning only (without the Chinese pronunciation), rather than as ateji, which is the classification used when a loanword term is using existing sounds only (as in \\"tempura\\"), or alternatively as a compound with meaning only (as in ‚Äì the sound tabako cannot be broken down into readings of individual characters). In principle these could be considered as 1-character meaning-only ateji, but because the reading corresponds to a single character, these are considered readings instead. Note that while kun'yomi are generally written as hiragana when writing out the word in kana instead of kanji (because native Japanese), these gairaigo kun'yomi are generally written as katakana (because a foreign borrowing). See single character gairaigo for further discussion. Note that numerically, most of these characters are for units, particularly SI units, in many cases using new characters (kokuji) coined during the Meiji period, such as . Some non- kanji symbols or Latin character abbreviations also have loanword readings, often quite long; a common example is '%' (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading (pƒÅsento), while the word \\"centimeter\\" is generally written as \\"cm\\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space) and has the seven kana reading (senchimƒìtoru) it can also be written as , as with kilometer above, though this is very rare). Many borrowed measurement terms may be written as tiny abbreviations stuffed into a single character space called : (for centimeters; senchi), (for kilo; kiro), etc. In a few cases, the etymology of a word is unclear, and hence whether the term is a borrowing or not cannot be determined. One such example is , which may be from native Japanese or , or may be from English bill; it is currently frequently written in katakana, however. = Kanbun = There are occasional spellings which derive from Kanbun (Japanese form of literary Chinese), where the kanji form follows literary Chinese, but the pronunciation follows Japanese. An example of this is writing (fu-, \\"no, not\\") before a kanji for a verb, corresponding to the verb inflection (-zu) ‚Äì for example, writing for shi-razu \\"not knowing\\". The word is read as shirazu (as if it were a native Japanese verb), though in this case is also a Sino-Japanese word (a noun), read as fuchi, meaning \\"ignorance\\". These are primarily found in older literature, but are occasionally used in variant spellings of everyday words, such as oya-shirazu \\"wisdom tooth\\".

The term 'Ariosophy', meaning wisdom concerning the Aryans, was first coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915 and became the label for his doctrine in the 1920s. In research on the topic, such as Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's book The Occult Roots of Nazism, the term 'Ariosophy' is used generically to describe the Aryan-esoteric theories of a subset of the 'V√∂lkische Bewegung'., note 1 to the Introduction. This broader use of the word is retrospective and was not generally current among the esotericists themselves.\\" List actually called his doctrine 'Armanism', while Lanz used the terms 'Theozoology' and 'Ario-Christianity' before the First World War. The ideas of Von List and Lanz von Liebenfels were part of a general occult revival in Austria and Germany of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, loosely inspired by Christianity, historical Germanic paganism and holistic philosophy as well as esoteric concepts influenced by German romanticism and Theosophy. The connection of this Germanic mysticism with historical Germanic culture is evident in the mystics' fascination with runes, in the form of Guido von List's Armanen runes. Overview Ideology regarding the Aryan race (in the sense of Indo- Europeans, runic symbols, the swastika, and sometimes occultism) are important elements in Ariosophy. From around 1900, esoteric notions entered Guido List's thoughts by 1899 at the latest. In April 1903 he sent his manuscript, proposing what Goodrick-Clarke calls a \\"monumental pseudoscience\\" concerning the ancient German faith, to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna onwards. These Ariosophic ideas (together with, and influenced by, Theosophy) contributed significantly to an occult counterculture in Germany and Austria. A historic interest in this topic has stemmed from the ideological relation of Ariosophy to Nazism, and is obvious in such book titles as: *The Occult Roots of Nazism by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke *Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab (The Man Who Gave Hitler His Ideas), Wilfried Daim's biography of Lanz von Liebenfels However, Goodrick-Clarke's comprehensive study finds little evidence of direct influence, except in the case of the highly idiosyncratic ancient-German mythos elaborated by the \\"clairvoyant\\" SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Karl Maria Wiligut, of which the practical consequences were, first, the incorporation of Wiligut's symbolism into the ceremonies of an elite circle within the SS; and, secondly, the official censure of those occultists and runic magicians whom Wiligut stigmatised as heretics, which may have persuaded Heinrich Himmler to order the internment of several of them. The most notable other case is Himmler's Ahnenerbe. (For the debate on the direct relations to Nazi ideology see Religious aspects of Nazism.) Goodrick-Clarke examines what evidence there is for influences on Hitler and on other Nazis, but he concludes that \\"Ariosophy is a symptom rather than an influence in the way that it anticipated Nazism\\". ='Ariosophic' writers and organisations= While a broad definition of the term 'Ariosophy' is useful for some purposes, various of the later authors, including Ellegaard Ellerbek, Philipp Stauff and G√ºnther Kirchoff, can more exactly be described as cultivating the Armanism of List. In a less broad approach one could also treat rune occultism separately. Although the Armanen runes go back to List, Rudolf John Gorsleben distinguished himself from other v√∂lkisch writers by making the esoteric importance of the runes central to his world view. Goodrick-Clarke therefore refers to the doctrine of Kummer and Gorsleben and his followers as rune occultism, a description which also fits the eclectic work of Karl Spiesberger. Highly practical systems of rune occultism, influenced mainly by List, were developed by Friedrich Bernhard Marby and Siegfried Adolf Kummer. In this, he became strongly influenced by the Theosophical thought of Madame Blavatsky, which he blended however with his own highly original beliefs, founded upon Germanic paganism. Before he turned to occultism, Guido List had written articles for German Nationalist newspapers in Austria, as well as four historical novels and three plays, some of which were \\"set in tribal Germany\\" before the advent of Christianity. He also had written an anti-semitic essay in 1895. List adopted the aristocratic von between 1903 and 1907. List called his doctrine Armanism after the Armanen, supposedly a body of priest-kings in the ancient Aryo-Germanic nation. He claimed that this German name had been Latinized into the tribal name Herminones mentioned in Tacitus and that it actually meant the heirs of the sun-king: an estate of intellectuals who were organised into a priesthood called the Armanenschaft. His conception of the original religion of the Germanic tribes was a form of sun worship, with its priest-kings (similar to the Icelandic go√∞i) as legendary rulers of ancient Germany. Religious instruction was imparted on two levels. The esoteric doctrine (Armanism) was concerned with the secret mysteries of the gnosis, reserved for the initiated elite, while the exoteric doctrine (Wotanism) took the form of popular myths intended for the lower social classes. List believed that the transition from Wotanism to Christianity had proceeded smoothly under the direction of the skalds, so that native customs, festivals and names were preserved under a Christian veneer and only needed to be 'decoded' back into their heathen forms. This peaceful merging of the two religions had been disrupted by the forcible conversions under \\"bloody Charlemagne ‚Äì the Slaughterer of the Saxons\\". List claimed that the dominance of the Roman Catholic Church in Austria-Hungary constituted a continuing occupation of the Germanic tribes by the Roman empire, albeit now in a religious form, and a continuing persecution of the ancient religion of the Germanic peoples and Celts. He also believed in the magical powers of the old runes. From 1891 onwards he claimed that heraldry was based on a system of encoded runes, so that heraldic devices conveyed a secret heritage in cryptic form. In April 1903, he submitted an article concerning the alleged Aryan proto-language to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna. Its highlight was a mystical and occult interpretation of the runic alphabet, which became the cornerstone of his ideology. Although the article was rejected by the academy, it would later be expanded by List and grew into his final masterpiece, a comprehensive treatment of his linguistic and historical theories published in 1914 as Die Ursprache der Ario-Germanen und ihre Mysteriensprache (The Proto-Language of the Aryo-Germanics and their Mystery Language). List's doctrine has been described as gnostic, pantheist and deist. At its core is the mystical union of God, man and nature. Wotanism teaches that God dwells within the individual human spirit as an inner source of magical power, but is also immanent within nature through the primal laws which govern the cycles of growth, decay and renewal. List explicitly rejects a Mind-body dualism of spirit versus matter or of God over or against nature. Humanity is therefore one with the universe, which entails an obligation to live in accordance with nature. But the individual human ego does not seek to merge with the cosmos. \\"Man is a separate agent, necessary to the completion or perfection of ‚ÄòGod's work‚Äô\\". Being immortal, the ego passes through successive reincarnations until it overcomes all obstacles to its purpose. List foresaw the eventual consequences of this in a future utopia on earth, which he identified with the promised Valhalla, a world of victorious heroes: List was familiar with the cyclical notion of time, which he encountered in Norse mythology and in the theosophical adaptation of the Hindu time cycles. He had already made use of cosmic rhythms in his early journalism on natural landscapes.. In his later works List combined the cyclical concept of time with the \\"dualistic and linear time scheme\\" of western apocalyptic which counterposes a pessimism about the present world with an ultimate optimism regarding the future one. In Das Geheimnis der Runen,. List addresses the seeming contradiction by explaining the final redemption of the linear time frame as an exoteric parable which stands for the esoteric truth of renewal in many future cycles and incarnations. However, in the original Norse myths and Hinduism, the cycle of destruction and creation is repeated indefinitely, thus offering no possibility of ultimate salvation. =Guido von List Society and High Armanen Order= Already in 1893 Guido List together with Fanny Wschiansky, had founded the Literarische Donaugesellschaft, a literary society . In 1908 the Guido von List Society (Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft) was founded primarily by the Wannieck family (Friedrich Wannieck and his son Friedrich Oskar Wannieck being prominent and enthusiastic Armanists) as an occult v√∂lkisch organisation, with the purpose of financing and publishing List's research. The List Society was supported by many leading figures in Austrian and German politics, publishing, and occultism. Although one might suspect a v√∂lkisch organisation to be antisemitic, the society included at least two Jews among its members: Moritz Altsch√ºler, a rabbinical scholar, and Ernst Wachler. affirms Wachler's membership in the List Society. The List Society published List's works under the series Guido-List-B√ºcherei (GLB). List had established exoteric and esoteric circles in his organisation. The High Armanen Order (Hoher Armanen Orden) was the inner circle of the Guido von List Society. Founded in midsummer 1911, it was set up as a magical order or lodge to support List's deeper and more practical work. The HAO conducted pilgrimages to what its members considered \\"holy Armanic sites\\", Stephansdom in Vienna, Carnuntum etc. They also had occasional meetings between 1911 and 1918, but the exact nature of these remains unknown. In his introduction to List's The Secret of the Runes, Stephen E. Flowers notes: \\"The HAO never really crystallized in List's lifetime ‚Äì although it seems possible that he developed a theoretical body of unpublished documents and rituals relevant to the HAO which have only been put into full practice in more recent years\\". =Listians under the Third Reich= List died on 17 May 1919, a few months before Adolf Hitler joined a minor Bavarian political party and formed it into the NSDAP. After the Nazis had come to power, several advocates of Armanism fell victim to the suppression of esotericism in Nazi Germany. The main reason for the persecution of occultists was the Nazi policy of systematically closing down esoteric organisations (although Germanic paganism was still practised by some Nazis on an individual basis), but the instigator in certain cases was Himmler's personal occultist, Karl Maria Wiligut. Wiligut identified the monotheistic religion of Irminism as the true ancestral belief, claiming that Guido von List's Wotanism and runic row constituted a schismatic false religion . Among the Listians ‚Äì Kummer and Marby are not mentioned by Goodrick-Clarke among the signatories who endorsed the List Society around 1905 but both men were indebted to \\"Listian\\" ideas ‚Äì who were subjected to censure were the rune occultists Friedrich Bernhard Marby and Siegfried Adolf Kummer, both of whom were denounced by Wiligut in 1934 in a letter to Himmler.Karl-Maria Weisthor (i.e. Wiligut) to Himmler, 2 May 1934, Bundesarchiv, Koblenz, Himmler Nachlass 19, cited in Flowers writes: \\"The establishment of [an] 'official NS runology' under Himmler, Wiligut, and others led directly to the need to suppress the rune-magical 'free agents' such as Marby\\". Despite having openly supported the Nazis, cited in Marby was arrested by the Gestapo in 1936 as an anti-Nazi occultist and was interned in Welzheim, Flossenb√ºrg and Dachau concentration camps. Kummer disappears from History after Wiligut's denunciation in 1934, and his fate is unknown. He may have died in a concentration camp. According to Rudgley, \\"[u]nsubstantiated rumours\\" have him fleeing Nazi Germany in exile to South America, but \\"it is more likely that he perished in one of the camps that Marby was to survive or died during the Allied bombing of Dresden.\\" G√ºnter Kirchhoff, a List Society member whom Wiligut had recommended to Himmler on the strength of his researches into prehistory, is reported to have written that Wiligut by intrigue had ensured that Ernst Lauterer (a.k.a. \\"Tarnhari\\") ‚Äì another List Society member, who claimed a secret clan tradition which rivalled Wiligut's own ‚Äì was committed to a concentration camp as an \\"English agent\\". Flowers and Moynihan reproduce Kirchhoff's testimony as reported by both Adolf Schleipfer and researcher Manfred Lenz (but doubted by Wiligut's former secretary Gabriele Dechend). Theozoology J√∂rg Lanz von Liebenfels Flag of the Order of the New Templars In 1903‚Äì4, a Viennese ex-Cistercian monk, Bible scholar and inventor named J√∂rg Lanz-Liebenfels (subsequently, J√∂rg Lanz von Liebenfels) published a lengthy article under the Latin title \\"Anthropozoon Biblicum\\" (\\"The Biblical Man-Animal\\") in a journal for Biblical studies edited by Moritz Altsch√ºler, a Jewish admirer of Guido von List. The author undertook a comparative survey of ancient Near Eastern cultures, in which he detected evidence from iconography and literature which seemed to point to the continued survival, into early historical times, of hominid ape-men similar to the dwarfish Neanderthal men known from fossil remains in Europe, or the Pithecanthropus (now called Homo erectus) from Java. Furthermore, Lanz systematically analysed the Old Testament in the light of his hypothesis, identifying and interpreting coded references to the ape-men which substantiated an illicit practice of interbreeding between humans and \\"lower\\" species in antiquity. In 1905 he expanded these researches into a fundamental statement of doctrine titled Theozoologie oder die Kunde von den Sodoms- √Ñfflingen und dem G√∂tter-Elektron. (\\"Theozoology, or the Science of the Sodomite-Apelings and the Divine Electron\\"). He claimed that \\"Aryan\\" peoples originated from interstellar deities (termed Theozoa) who bred by electricity, while \\"lower\\" races were a result of interbreeding between humans and ape-men (or Anthropozoa). The effects of racial crossing caused the atrophy of paranormal powers inherited from the gods, but these could be restored by the selective breeding of pure Aryan lineages. The book relied on somewhat lurid sexual imagery, decrying the abuse of white women by ethnically inferior but sexually active men. Thus, Lanz advocated mass castration of racially \\"apelike\\" or otherwise \\"inferior\\" males. In the same year, Lanz commenced publication of the journal Ostara (named after a pagan Germanic goddess of spring) to promote his vision of racial purity. On December 25, 1907, he founded the Order of the New Templars (Ordo Novi Templi, or ONT), a mystical association with its headquarters at Burg Werfenstein, a castle in Upper Austria overlooking the river Danube. Its declared aim was to harmonise science, art and religion on a basis of racial consciousness. Rituals were designed to beautify life in accordance with Aryan aesthetics, and to express the Order's theological system which Lanz called Ario-Christianity. The Order was the first to use the swastika in an \\"Aryan\\" meaning, displaying on its flag the device of a red swastika facing right, on a yellow-orange field and surrounded by four blue fleurs-de-lys above, below, to the right and to the left. The ONT declined from the mid-1930s and - even though it had pioneered many ideas which the Nazis later adopted - it was suppressed by the Gestapo in 1942. By this time it had established seven communities in Austria, Germany and Hungary. Though suspending its activities in the Greater German Reich, the ONT survived in Hungary until around the end of World War II. It went underground in Vienna after 1945, but was contacted in 1958 by a former Waffen-SS lieutenant, Rudolf Mund, who became Prior of the Order in 1979. Mund also wrote biographies of Lanz and Wiligut. The term \\"Ariosophy\\" (wisdom concerning the Aryans) was coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915, with \\"Theozoology\\" describing its Genesis and \\"Ario-Christianity\\" as the label for the overall doctrine in the 1920s. This terminology was taken up by a group of occultists, formed in Berlin around 1920 and referred to by one of its main figures, Ernst Issberner-Haldane, as the 'Swastika-Circle'. Lanz's publisher, Herbert Reichstein, made contact with the group in 1925 and formed it into an institute with himself as director. This association was named the Ariosophical Society in 1926, renamed the Neue Kalandsgesellschaft (from Kaland, Guido von List's term for a secret lodge or conventicle) in 1928, and renamed again as the Ariosophische Kulturzentrale in 1931, the year in which it opened an Ariosophical School at Pressbaum that offered courses and lectures in runic lore, biorhythms, yoga and Qabalah. The institute maintained a friendly collaboration with Lanz, its guiding intellect and inspiration, but also acknowledged an indebtedness to List, declaring itself as the successor to the Armanen priest-kings and their hierophantic tradition. Reichstein's circle therefore establishes the historical precedent for a broad conception that was followed by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke in 1985 when he redefined Ariosophy as a general term to describe Aryan-centric occult theories and hermetic practices, including both Lanz's Ario-Christianity and the earlier Armanism of List, as well as later derivatives of either or both systems. If the term is employed in this extended sense, then Guido von List, and not Lanz von Liebenfels, was the founder of Ariosophy. The justification for the broad definition is that List and Lanz were mutually influencing. The two men joined one another's societies; List figures in Lanz's pedigree of initiated predecessors; and Lanz is cited several times by List in The Religion of the Aryo-Germanic Folk: Esoteric and Exoteric (1910). Germanenorden Although List had been concerned \\"to awaken German nationalist consciousness\\", the High Armanen Order had addressed itself to the upper and middle class Germans in Austria, and here List had preferred the \\"role of the mystagogue\\" over political activism. List's disciples, however, became active in the Reichshammerbund and the Germanenorden, two \\"historically significant\\", \\"virulently antisemitic groups\\" in Germany. Both groups were organized by the political activist Theodor Fritsch, a major figure in German antisemitism. Fritsch, born 1852, was the son of Saxon peasants, and he was concerned about the \\"small tradesmen and craftsmen\\" and their threat from what he perceived to be the large 'Jewish' industry. The List-inspired Germanenorden (Germanic Order or Teutonic Order, not to be confused with the medieval German order of the Teutonic Knights) was a v√∂lkisch secret society in early 20th-century Germany. It was founded in Berlin in 1912 by Theodor Fritsch and several prominent German occultists including Philipp Stauff, who held office in the List Society and High Armanen Order as well as Hermann Pohl, who became the Germanenorden's first leader. The group was a clandestine movement aimed at the upper echelons of society and was a sister movement to the more mainstream Reichshammerbund. The order, whose symbol was a swastika, had a hierarchical fraternal structure similar to Freemasonry. Local groups of the sect met to celebrate the summer solstice, an important neopagan festivity in v√∂lkisch circles (and later in Nazi Germany), and more regularly to read the Eddas as well as some of the German mystics. In addition to occult and magical philosophies, it taught to its initiates nationalist ideologies of Nordic racial superiority and antisemitism, then rising throughout the Western world. As was becoming increasingly typical of v√∂lkisch organisations, it required its candidates to prove that they had no non-Aryan bloodlines and required from each a promise to maintain purity of his stock in marriage. In 1916, during World War I, the Germanenorden split into two parts. Eberhard von Brockhusen became the Grand Master of the \\"loyalist\\" Germanenorden. Pohl, previously the order's Chancellor, founded a schismatic offshoot: the Germanenorden Walvater of the Holy Grail. He was joined in the same year by Rudolf von Sebottendorff (formerly Rudolf Glauer), a wealthy adventurer with wide-ranging occult and mystical interests. A Freemason and a practitioner of sufism and astrology, Sebottendorff was also an admirer of Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. Convinced that the Islamic and Germanic mystical systems shared a common Aryan root, he was attracted by Pohl's runic lore and became the Master of the Walvater's Bavarian province late in 1917. Charged with reviving the province's fortunes, Sebottendorff increased membership from about a hundred in 1917 to 1500 by the autumn of the following year. Thule Society In 1918 Sebottendorff made contact with Walter Nauhaus, a member of the Germanenorden who headed a \\"Germanic study group\\" called the Thule Gesellschaft (Thule Society). The name of Nauhaus's original Thule Society was adopted as a cover-name for Sebottendorff's Munich lodge of the Germanenorden Walvater when it was formally dedicated on August 18, 1918, with Pohl's assistance and approval. Sebottendorff states that the group was run jointly by himself and Nauhaus. Deriving elements of its ideology and membership from earlier occult groups founded by List (Guido von List Society, established 1908) and Lanz von Liebenfels (the Order of the New Templars, established 1907), the Thule Society was dedicated to the triune god Walvater, identified with Wotan in triple form. For the Society's emblem Sebottendorff selected the oak leaves, dagger and swastika. The name Thule (an island located by Greek geographers at the northernmost extremity of the world) was chosen for its significance in the works of Guido von List. According to Thule Society mythology, Thule was the capital of Hyperborea, a legendary country supposedly in the far North polar regions, originally mentioned by Herodotus from Egyptian sources. In 1679, Olaf Rudbeck equated the Hyperboreans with the survivors of Atlantis, who were first mentioned by Plato, again following Egyptian sources. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900) began his work Der Antichrist (The Antichrist) in 1895 with, \\"Let us see ourselves for what we are. We are Hyperboreans.\\" From a historian's perspective, the importance of the Thule Society lies in its organising the discussion circle which led to the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei, or DAP), founded in January 1919. The Thule Society's Karl Harrer was a co-founder, along with Anton Drexler (the party's first chairman). Later the same year, Adolf Hitler joined the DAP, which was renamed as the NSDAP (or Nazi party) on April 1, 1920. Some conspiracy theorists argue that the NSDAP, when under Hitler's leadership, was a political front for the Thule Society. However, against this theory stands Harrer's and Drexler's resistance to Hitler. After unsuccessful challenges to his growing power, both men resigned from the party, Harrer in 1920 and Drexler in 1923. Speculative authors assert that a number of high Nazi Party officials had been members of the Thule Society (including such prominent figures as Max Amann, Dietrich Eckart, Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg and Gottfried Feder). Eckart, the wealthy publisher of the newspaper Auf gut Deutsch (In Plain German), has been represented as a committed occultist and the most significant Thule influence on Hitler. He is believed to have taught Hitler a number of persuasive techniques, and so profound was his influence that the second volume of Hitler's book Mein Kampf was dedicated to him. However, although Eckart attended Thule Society meetings, he was not a member and there is nothing to indicate that he trained Hitler in techniques of a mystical nature. Examining the membership lists, Goodrick-Clarke notes that Hess, Rosenberg and Feder were ‚Äì like Eckart ‚Äì guests of the Thule Society in 1918 but not actual members. He also describes a Thule Society membership roll including Hans Frank and Heinrich Himmler as \\"spurious\\". There is no evidence that Hitler himself had any connection with the Society, even as an associate or visitor. However, a member of the Thule Society, dentist Dr. Friedrich Krohn, did choose the swastika symbol for the Nazi party (although the design was revised at Hitler's insistence). In 1923, Sebottendorff was expelled from Germany as an undesirable alien; around 1925, the Thule Society disbanded. In 1933, Sebottendorff returned to Germany and published Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundliches aus der Fr√ºhzeit der nationalsozialistischen Bewegung von Rudolf von Sebottendorff. The book was banned by the Bavarian Political Police on March 1, 1934; Sebottendorff was arrested by the Gestapo, interned in a concentration camp, then expelled to Turkey yet again, where he committed suicide by drowning in the Bosphorus on May 9, 1945, as the Nazis surrendered to the Allies. Edda Society Rudolf John Gorsleben Rudolf John Gorsleben was associated with the Thule Society during the Bavarian Soviet Republic of 1919 and, along with Dietrich Eckart, he was taken prisoner by the Communists, narrowly escaping execution. He threw himself into the ferment of Bavaria's v√∂lkisch politics and formed a close working relationship with the local Germanenorden before devoting himself to literary pursuits. On 29 November 1925, Gorsleben founded the Edda Society (Edda-Gesellschaft), a mystic study group, at Dinkelsb√ºhl in Franconia. He himself was Chancellor of the Society and published its periodical Deutsche Freiheit (German Freedom), later renamed Arische Freiheit (Aryan Freedom). Assisted by learned contributors to his study-group, Gorsleben developed an original and eclectic mystery religion founded in part upon the Armanism of List, whom he quoted with approval. Grand Master of the Society was Werner von B√ºlow (1870‚Äì1947). The treasurer was Friedrich Schaefer from M√ºhlhausen, whose wife, K√§the, kept open house for another occult-v√∂lkisch circle (the 'Free Sons of the North and Baltic Seas') which gathered around Karl Maria Wiligut in the early 1930s. Mathilde von Kemnitz, a prolific v√∂lkisch writer who married General Erich Ludendorff in 1926, was an active member of the Edda Society. When Rudolf John Gorsleben died from heart disease in August 1930, the Edda Society was taken over by B√ºlow who had designed a 'world-rune-clock' which illustrated the correspondences between the runes, the gods and the zodiac, as well as colours and numbers. B√ºlow also took over the running of Gorsleben's periodical and changed its name from Arische Freiheit to Hag All All Hag, and then Hagal. Modern organisations In the later 20th century, Germanic neopagan movements oriented themselves more towards polytheistic reconstructionism, turning away from theosophic and occult elements, but elements of Ariosophical mysticism continue to play a role in some white supremacist organizations. Alleged mystical or shamanic aspects of historical pre-Christian Germanic culture, summarized as seidr are also practiced in Odinism (Freya Aswynn, Nigel Pennick, Karl Spiesberger, see also Germanic Runic Astrology, The Book of Blotar). =Armanen-Orden= Armanen Futharkh. The Guido von List Society was re-established in the late 1960s through contacts between the German/Austrian occultist Adolf Schleipfer (1947‚Äì) and the still-living last president of the Society, Hanns Bierbach.According to , Schleipfer renewed the GvLS in 1969. According to , he became its president in 1967. Schleipfer had discovered some of List's works in an antique bookstore in the mid-1960s, and was inspired to found the runic and Armanist magazine Irminsul in the German National Library. in hopes of attracting suitable people for a revived Listian order. He was appointed the new president and continued to publish Irminsul as the \\"Voice of the Guido von List Society.\\" Schleipfer also attended meetings of a related organisation, the Gode-Orden (Gothi-Order), which propagated a similar mixture of occult v√∂lkisch thinking. There he met his wife Sigrun Schleipfer, n√©e Hammerbacher (1940‚Äì2009), daughter of the v√∂lkisch writer and former NSDAP district leader, Dr. Hans Wilhelm Hammerbacher. In 1976 the Schleipfers founded the Armanen-Orden (Armanen Order) as the reorganised Guido von List Society. Since then, Adolf and Sigrun have served as the Grandmasters of the Order, although they have divorced and Sigrun now refers to herself as \\"Sigrun von Schlichting\\" or \\"Sigrun Freifrau von Schlichting\\". They also revived the High Armanen Order (HAO) and brought it to \\"an unprecedented level of activity\\". The Armanen-Orden is a neopagan esoteric society and religious order reviving the occult teachings of Guido von List. Its internal structure is organized in nine grades, inspired by Freemasonry. The order is modelled on, but not limited to, the precepts of List, and its principles as formulated in its brochures are as follows: The Armanen-Orden celebrates seasonal festivities in a similar fashion as Odinist groups do and invites interested people to these events. The highlights are three 'Things' at Ostara (Easter), Midsummer and Fall (Wotan's sacrificial death), which are mostly celebrated at castles close to sacred places, such as the Externsteine. The author Stefanie von Schnurbein attended a Fall Thing in 1990 and gives the following report in Religion als Kulturkritik (Religion and Cultural Criticism): In 1977 Sigrun Schleipfer founded the Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung der Burgen (Society for the Conservation of Castles), which proclaims castles to be among the \\"last paradises of the romantic era\\" in this cold modern age and had as its primary aim the purchase and restoration of a castle for the Order. In 1995, the society finally acquired the castle of Rothenhorn in Szlichtyngowa (Poland), a run-down structure dating back to the 12th century, though most of the complex dates from the 16th century. Over many years, Adolf and Sigrun have republished all of List's works (and many others relating to the Armanen runes) in their original German. Adolf Schleipfer has also contributed an article to The Secret King, a study of Karl Maria Wiligut by Stephen Flowers and Michael Moynihan, in which he points out the differences between Wiligut's beliefs and those which are accepted within Odinism or Armanism. Research on Ariosophy After the war, Lanz von Liebenfels was first brought to a wider (and scholarly) attention with Wilfried Daim's book Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab (The Man Who Gave Hitler His Ideas) (1957). Although the book was not always taken seriously within academia, for some time Lanz was seen as one of the most important influences on Hitler. Since the 1990s, however, historians have cast doubt on Lanz' significance. The historian Brigitte Hamann, who has written Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship, is of the view that Lanz partly influenced Hitler's diction, but had only marginal influences on Adolf Hitler's religious views. =The occult roots of Nazism= Some of Lanz's proposals for racial purification anticipate the Nazis. The sterilisation of those deemed to be genetically \\"unfit\\" was in fact implemented under the Nazi eugenics policies, but its basis lay in the theories of scientific racial hygienists. The Nazi eugenics programme has no proven connection with Lanz's mystical rationale. Eugenic ideas were widespread in his lifetime, whereas he himself was banned from publishing in the Third Reich and his writings were suppressed. Following Goodrick-Clarke's caution in assessing the relation between the two,, (preface by Rohan Butler). Adolf Hitler cannot be considered a pupil of Lanz von Liebenfels, as Lanz himself had claimed. However, it has been suggested with some evidential basis that the young Hitler did read and collect Lanz's Ostara magazine while living in Vienna: Nevertheless: \\"It also remains a fact that Hitler never mentioned the name of Lanz in any recorded conversation, speech, or document. If Hitler had been importantly influenced by [Lanz], he cannot be said to have ever acknowledged this debt\\".

Shortly after she was expelled from high school she traveled to Palo Alto, California in 1963 with her older brother, Don. She got a job at Stanford University, working for Carl Djerassi in the organic chemistry lab analyzing psychiatric drugs, and she eventually was fired for, \\"dipping into the experimental psychedelic chemicals she was analyzing:\\" In early 1964, she met Neal Cassady, who introduced her to Ken Kesey and his friends, one of whom gave her the name \\"Mountain Girl\\".

(1968). The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kesey was arrested for marijuana possession in La Honda, in 1965 and fled to Mexico. He returned and nights after being sentenced to six months in the San Mateo County Jail, he was arrested again, this time with Carolyn Adams, while smoking marijuana on the rooftop of Stewart Brand's home in Telegraph Hill, San Francisco.Charles Perry, From eternity to here, Rolling Stone, February 26, 1976; retrieved January 16, 2016. She had a relationship with another Prankster named George Walker, who would become her husband in 1966. They separated in December 1966 and were divorced in 1978. She took up with Jerry Garcia after splitting with Walker, but they did not marry for many years after. While living together over the next decade, they raised Sunshine along with their two daughters. The family had a house in San Rafael, California as well as a beach house in Stinson Beach, California. Garcia and Adams separated in 1975 after he began a relationship with filmmaker Deborah Koons. Although Garcia and Adams reconciled after the dissolution of his relationship with Koons in 1977, they stopped cohabiting a year later (save for occasional holiday reunions) due to the guitarist's heroin and cocaine addictions. After marrying \\"partly for tax purposes and partly out of a fond flickering of a once-bright romance\\" in late 1981, this arrangement persisted until Garcia entered a diabetic coma in 1986. While this led to a lengthy period of cohabitation in which Carolyn Garcia played an integral role in her husband's recovery, they gradually drifted apart once more when Garcia began an extramarital relationship and fathered a child with Manasha Matheson. Jerry and Carolyn Garcia divorced in 1994, but remained friends until his death. During this period, he rekindled his relationship with Koons, who had been largely out of his life since the late 1970s; they would ultimately marry in February 1994. A month after the Grateful Dead's summer 1995 tour concluded, Garcia died at a rehabilitation facility in August 1995.

He seems to have felt a deep personal hatred for both Strafford and Laud, springing perhaps from profound religious differences. He was criticised for his conduct at Laud's execution, where he thrust himself forward and harangued that elderly man, who was trying to prepare himself for death, on his alleged religious errors.Hugh Trevor-Roper Archbishop Laud Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p. 428 In 1646 during the Irish Confederate Wars he unsuccessfully negotiated with the Royalist commander James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde for the surrender of Dublin to the Parliamentary forces. In 1647 during the English Civil War he was accused of having betrayed the Parliamentarian cause, and also of embezzlement, in consequence of which charges he fled to the Continent, but returned to parliament in June 1648. On 12 December 1648 he was arrested and remained in prison (including at Wallingford Castle) for nearly three years. Having taken an active part in forwarding the Restoration of Charles II, he was employed in Ireland in arranging the affairs of the soldiers and other adventurers who had settled in Ireland. Clotworthy in no way abated his old animosity against Papists and High Anglicans and championed the cause of the Irish Presbyterians. Notwithstanding, being personally agreeable to King Charles II, his religious views were overlooked, and on 21 November 1660 he was created Baron Lough Neagh and Viscount Massereene in the Irish peerage, with remainder in default of male heirs to his son-in-law, Sir John Skeffington.

The sole member of her class, she was the flagship of the Finnish Navy as well as the largest naval ship in service in Finland until 2013. The ship has a Finnish-Swedish ice class 1A so she can operate all year round. During a crisis, the main task for Pohjanmaa would have been mine laying and acting as a command ship. She also acted as a school ship for the Naval Academy cadets. Part of their training includes an annual cruise abroad. The 34-year-old Pohjanmaa was scheduled for decommissioning in late 2013. In October 2013, minelayer took over the role of flagship of the Finnish Navy.Miinalaiva Pohjanmaa j√§tti hyv√§stins√§ torstaina - katso video. Ilta-Sanomat, 23 August 2013. Pohjanmaa was sold to the Finnish company Meritaito in 2016 and refitted as a survey vessel. She was renamed Pohjanmeri, Finnish for the North Sea.Pohjanmaasta tuli m/s Pohjanmeri ‚Äì ty√∂t odottavat Barentsinmerell√§. Turun Sanomat, 12 July 2016.  History  Pohjanmaa was built in 1979 at the W√§rtsil√§ Helsinki Shipyard, Finland. Pohjanmaa first served as a school ship for the Naval Academy until 1992 when she was transferred to the Gulf of Finland Navy (Now called Gulf of Finland Naval Command). When she was completed, she replaced the minelayer Ruotsinsalmi and as a school ship, Matti Kurki. On 10 May 1982, she was given the traditional shield of ocean faring vessels previously held by Suomen Joutsen, so in effect Pohjanmaa continues the tradition of the three ships. The ship underwent a heavy modernization program in 1996‚Äì1998, which included a replacing her 120 mm main gun with a more modern Bofors 57 mm fully automatic anti-aircraft gun. The annual training cruise for the cadets has taken the ship as far as Bel√©m, Brazil. The accommodation capacity of the vessel for the long range cruises can be increased with accommodation containers. On 28 June 2005, as part of their cruise, Pohjanmaa participated in the International Fleet Review which is a part of the Trafalgar 200 celebrations. In 2007, the ship was refitted together with the s and her colour scheme changed from camouflage to light grey. Her second aft gun was also removed from the aft deck due to narrow shooting sectors, which were even further narrowed due to a new bigger hydraulic crane of a new seaboat. In 2010, it was decided that the Pohjanmaa would participate in Operation Atalanta in 2011. On 6 April 2011, Pohjanmaa captured a vessel suspected as pirate mothership along with two speedboats. The search onboard revealed assault rifles, RPGs and other weapons. Eighteen of the suspected pirates were incarcerated onboard Pohjanmaa. Article in the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat Since the Prosecutor General of Finland decided not to prosecute, the pirates were transferred to the jurisdiction of Operation Atalanta, which later released the pirates. The pirate ship and the speedboats were scuttled at sea.  Naming  Pohjanmaa was christened on 8 June 1979 by Aili Haapkyl√§. The name comes from the Swedish-built pojamas of the 1770s ‚Äî see \\"Pohjanmaa (disambiguation)\\" for other uses of the name. The vessel has been nicknamed Puuhamaa by the Finnish Navy conscripts after the Finnish amusement park.  Replacement  Despite modernizations, the over 30-year-old Pohjanmaa reached the end of her operational lifespan in the mid-2010s and the minelayer was decommissioned in late 2013.Miinalaiva Pohjanmaata ja satoja paseja uhkaa viimeinen k√§ytt√∂p√§iv√§.

He was a contemporary of Richard Cosway, George Engleheart, William Wood and Richard Crosse. Biography Smart was born in Norfolk, but not much is known of his early life. It is recorded that in 1755 he was runner up to Richard Cosway in a drawing competition for under-14s held by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. In the same year he began attending the new drawing school of William Shipley in London, along with Cosway and Richard Crosse. He exhibited at the Society of Artists, in London, from 1762 onwards; and became its president in 1778. He went to India in 1788 and obtained a number of commissions in that country. He settled down in London in 1797, latterly in Fitzroy Street, and died there in 1811. He was a man of simple habits, and a member of the Society of Sandemanians. Work Smart mainly painted watercolour miniatures on ivory, and often clearly signed and dated his work. A number of his preparatory drawings and sketches survive. His work is entirely different from that of Cosway, quiet and grey in its colouring, with the flesh tints elaborated with much subtlety and modelled in exquisite fashion. He possessed a great knowledge of anatomy, and his portraits are drawn with greater anatomical accuracy and possess more distinction than those of any miniature painter of his time. The most important collection of Smart's work was given by John W. and Martha Jane Phillips Starr to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The Starr collection includes a signed and dated miniature for each year of Smart's career, from 1760 to 1811, enabling scholars to view the full progression of Smart's style and technique as well as the changing fashions of the period. Many of his pencil drawings still exist in the possession of the descendants of a great friend of his only sister. Several of his miniatures are in Australia and belong to a cadet branch of the family. Smart taught portrait painting to Isabella Beetham, who was one of Britain's finest silhouette artists in the 18th century. Personal life Smart married Edith Vere, and is believed to have had only one son, who died in Madras in 1809.

In 2010, he celebrated his 30th year as a recording artist. Biography Karras was born in Kokkinohori, near Kavala, Greece. At the age of 10, his family moved to Thessaloniki. Also around this time his brother Damian and his sister Anastasia were born. Growing up in the streets of Thessaloniki allowed Karras considerable independence and many of the friendships he created there have lasted well into his life until now. In the summer of 1969, Karras made a brief appearance at the club \\"Prosfygas\\" in Evosmos, Thessaloniki and made an immediate impact. Even though he was only 16 years old, he became a favourite in the city suburbs due to his distinctive then raspy voice. The club owners allowed Vasilis to sing on many more occasions, and thus a legend was born. The audience in his home city took a particular liking in his style. In the 1970s, Karras cemented his reputation as a young upstart on the Greek 'laika' (folk songs) stage singing throughout Northern Greece and towards the end of the decade had begun to develop his own repertoire, working with song writers and also creating his own work. In 1980, his first album Alismonites Ores was released which set Karras on the long path towards fame and recognition. It was also at this time that Vasilis decided to devote his life and career to folk music and sing professionally. By the 1990s, his unique style and appeal to the Greek public catapulted Karras to national stardom. Partnerships with Michalis Rakintzis, Zafeiris Melas and Konstantina also furthered his reputation in Greece. In 1996, Karras contacted acclaimed songwriter Phoebus with the prospect of creating an album based on his songs. Phoebus responded positively and enthusiastically went to work creating songs that fit Vasilis' unique style and complemented his singing abilities. The result was the hit album Tilefonise Mou which went two time platinum and is Karras' all time best-seller. This album also started a new era for Vasilis: the introduction of a modern, western upbeat style to his music, which complemented his bouzouki-based folk/dance songs. It would become a style that Vasilis would perfect for many years to come and adopt prominently in his discography from then on. Vasilis and Phoebus also partnered for the 1999 hit album Epistrefo, a perennial mainstay in his club repertoire, with many hit singles. Around this time, Karras also worked with many young Greek talents in efforts to help their career. In particular, after spotting Despina Malea (now known as Despina Vandi), he offered her the chance to sing at his night club for the whole summer season, thus kick-starting her career. Vasilis and Despina would have the chance to work together later on in 2005 in a few duets from the music of common friend Phoebus. Vasilis Karras is regarded as a legend of folk music in Greece. Apart from continuing his discography, he also continues to sing at nightclubs in Athens and Thessaloniki and also travels around the globe to centres of the Greek diaspora, including the United States, (Germany), Australia and Canada. The audiences abroad have also taken a particular liking to his music, and Vasilis has many loyal fans outside of Greece. Recently he has partnered with other mainstays of the Greek music scene such as Tolis Voskopoulos, Christos Dantis, Eirini Merkouri, Kostas Karafotis, Despina Vandi and others, writing and performing many duets in their respective albums. His latest album was released in early 2009, titled Opos Pallia. Vasilis Karras' widespread appeal and numerous decades on the Greek music scene have cemented his legend as one of the top Greek folk singers ever, but it his laid back and accessible personality that has endeared him to others throughout the music industry and to the fans through the country and abroad. Vasilis is credited as the last singing survivors of the 'Kapsourika' style of songs in Greece, namely love songs about lost loves and reminiscing. Throughout his career he emphasized his love for his hometown and has written and sung many songs about Thessaloniki reminiscing about his childhood and early loves including \\"Den Pao Pouthena\\", \\"Nychta Kselogiastra\\", \\"Erhomai\\" and \\"Gia Afto Stasou\\". His 1987 album Apo ti Thessaloniki me agapi and his 1988 work Mia bradia sti Thessaloniki are examples of the special place the city has in his heart. Personal life He is married and has four children. Three daughters and one son. His youngest daughter died as an infant.

He was nicknamed \\"the Microwave\\" in the NBA. College basketball career Starting his career in 1975 at the juco McLennan Community College in Waco, Texas, Johnson was a star there for two years, leading the team to the NJCAA national tournament in the 1976-77 season while averaging 29 points per game and being named a junior college All-American. Johnson transferred across town to attend Baylor University for the 1977‚Äì78 and 1978-79 seasons. One of the most prolific scorers in Baylor basketball history, Johnson averaged 24.1 points per game in his two seasons in Waco. A two-time All-American, Johnson is the school record-holder in points-per-game average, ranks 15th in career points, and third in career assists average at Baylor. He was named All-SWC in both 1978 and 1979. Johnson also holds the Baylor record for most points scored in a game with 50 against TCU in 1979. Professional basketball career Johnson was chosen as the No. 7 overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. He was traded to the Detroit Pistons in November 1981.The Microwave At 6 feet 2 inches tall, Johnson's skill set allowed him to replace either point guard Isiah Thomas or shooting guard Joe Dumars from the bench. Johnson earned the nickname \\"the Microwave\\" from Boston Celtics guard Danny Ainge for his ability to score many points in a short period of time (i.e., Johnson could heat up the offense of the team in short order). On June 19, 1990, Johnson made a 14-foot shot with 0.7 seconds left on the clock, beating the Portland Trail Blazers 92‚Äì90 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, and giving Detroit a repeat championship. The basket earned Johnson a new nickname: 007. After leaving the Pistons following the 1990‚Äì91 season, Johnson would play one more season in the NBA with the San Antonio Spurs before retiring in 1992. From 1990 to 2001, he served as a color analyst on Pistons radio broadcasts. The Pistons honored Johnson's career by retiring his number 15 jersey in a ceremony on February 5, 1994, at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Johnson was influenced by Earl Monroe growing up and only wore number 15 throughout his playing days. When asked about it by a fan later he said, \\"It was a huge honor. The fact that they retired my jersey tells me that I did some great things for the organization.\\"  NBA career statistics  = Regular season = { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !Season !Team !GP !GS !MPG !FG% !3P% !2P% !FT% !RPG !APG !SPG !BPG !PPG - !1979‚Äì80 Seattle 38 0 8.6 .391 .000 .395 .795 1.4 1.4 0.5 0.1 3.2 - !1980‚Äì81 Seattle 81 0 28.5 .534 .200 .536 .793 4.5 4.2 1.0 0.2 13.0 - !1981‚Äì82 Seattle 7 0 14.9 .409 .000 .429 .750 2.1 1.6 0.9 0.3 3.9 - !1981‚Äì82 Detroit 67 15 17.8 .493 .273 .499 .754 2.1 2.4 0.7 0.3 7.7 - !1982‚Äì83 Detroit 82 51 30.6 .513 .275 .523 .778 4.3 3.7 1.1 0.6 15.8 - !1983‚Äì84 Detroit 82 0 23.3 .473 .211 .478 .753 2.9 3.3 0.5 0.2 13.0 - !1984‚Äì85 Detroit 82 16 25.5 .454 .185 .462 .769 3.1 4.0 0.9 0.2 12.8 - !1985‚Äì86 Detroit 79 12 25.0 .467 .154 .471 .771 2.9 3.4 1.0 0.3 13.9 - !1986‚Äì87 Detroit 78 8 27.8 .462 .286 .464 .786 3.3 3.8 1.2 0.2 15.7 - !1987‚Äì88 Detroit 82 1 23.6 .443 .208 .449 .677 2.8 3.3 0.7 0.2 12.2 - !style=\\"background:#afe6ba;\\"1988‚Äì89‚Ä† Detroit 82 21 25.3 .464 .295 .472 .734 3.1 3.0 0.9 0.2 13.8 - !style=\\"background:#afe6ba;\\"1989‚Äì90‚Ä† Detroit 82 12 24.0 .431 .147 .444 .668 3.1 3.1 0.9 0.2 9.8 - !1990‚Äì91 Detroit 82 28 29.1 .434 .324 .438 .646 3.4 3.3 0.9 0.2 11.7 - !1991‚Äì92 San Antonio 60 23 22.5 .405 .317 .417 .647 3.0 2.4 0.7 0.2 8.0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Career 984 187 24.7 .464 .254 .471 .740 3.2 3.3 0.9 0.3 12.0 } = Playoffs = { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !Season !Team !G !GS !MPG !FG% !3P% !2P% !FT% !RPG !APG !SPG !BPG !PPG - !1980 Seattle 5 0 2.4 .333 .000 .333 .000 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.4 - !1984 Detroit 5 0 26.4 .370 .000 .378 .895 2.8 2.4 0.2 0.2 10.2 - !1985 Detroit 9 0 26.1 .515 .000 .530 .786 3.0 3.2 0.7 0.1 14.2 - !1986 Detroit 4 0 21.3 .449 .000 .458 .538 4.3 2.8 0.8 0.0 12.8 - !1987 Detroit 15 0 25.9 .459 .000 .463 .861 2.9 4.1 0.6 0.3 14.7 - !1988 Detroit 23 0 20.7 .423 .143 .431 .660 3.3 1.9 0.7 0.2 10.3 - !style=\\"background:#afe6ba;\\"1989‚Ä† Detroit 17 0 21.9 .455 .417 .460 .758 2.6 2.5 0.2 0.2 14.1 - !style=\\"background:#afe6ba;\\"1990‚Ä† Detroit 20 0 23.2 .462 .286 .469 .791 2.8 2.7 0.4 0.2 10.3 - !1991 Detroit 15 3 29.2 .464 .154 .483 .710 5.1 2.9 0.7 0.3 15.2 - !1992 San Antonio 3 0 23.0 .458 .500 .450 .500 2.7 2.3 1.7 0.3 8.3 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Career 116 3 23.0 .453 .274 .462 .754 3.1 2.6 0.6 0.2 12.0 } Personal life Johnson grew up in Brooklyn, New York, attending Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School.

Advance was built in 1847 as Augusta in New Kent County, Virginia and loaned to the Navy on 7 May 1850 by Mr. Henry Grinnell to participate in the search for Sir John Franklin's arctic expedition which had been stranded in the frozen north since 1846. After last- minute preparations, the ship, under the command of Lieutenant Edwin J. De Haven and in company with , put to sea from New York on 23 May 1850. First rescue expedition Storms battered the two ships on the initial leg of the voyage and separated them. However, both safely reached Disko Island, located off the west coast of Greenland where Davis Strait gives way to Baffin Bay. Advance arrived on 24 June, and Rescue pulled into port three days later. On the 29th, the two ships headed into Baffin Bay, bound for Lancaster Sound located north of Baffin Island and south of Devon Island. Off Haroe Island on 1 July, Advance encountered pack ice. A week later, she and her consort were caught in the pack just north of Upernavik. For the next three weeks, the two ships fought their way through the ice. On the 29th, they cleared the pack and continued their voyage across Melville Bay to Lancaster Sound. The two ships entered the sound on 19 August and, that same day, encountered two British vessels engaged in the same mission as the Americans. That evening, a storm blew up and separated Advance and Rescue. The next day dawned \\"thick and foggy,\\" but the wind had abated. Advance began searching for her companion. By 25 August, she was off Cape Riley on Devon Island where she put ashore a landing party to search for clues to the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition. While the searchers ashore were discovering the former campsite of some unidentified party, Advance was run aground by a strong current. The British ship Prince Albert offered assistance, but Rescue showed up at about the same time. Moreover, Advance lightened her load and succeeded in hauling off by her own efforts. On 26 August, the two ships attempted the passage of Wellington Channel to search the area north of Cape Spencer. Soon, however, they found the way north blocked by a solid mass of pack ice and prudently returned south to the vicinity of Point Innes. There, the Americans again encountered the British, along with positive evidence of the Franklin party having camped nearby. Heartened by that find and by a favorable change in weather conditions, they headed back toward Wellington Channel. At Beechy Island, all the search vessels gathered in a cove (later called Union Bay) to plan a coordinated search. While the leading officers were so engaged, a party sent ashore discovered three graves and \\"other unmistakable evidences of the missing expedition (Franklin's) having passed its first winter here.\\" At that point, she and Rescue entered Wellington Channel to pursue the search, but the pack ice quickly closed in upon the two ships. Though they tried to escape the clutches of the pack, abysmal weather foiled their attempts; and Rescue suffered a damaged rudder. By mid-September, they were caught fast in the floating ice. For the duration of the winter, Advance and Rescue were at the mercy of the drifting floe. For what remained of September and most of October, they drifted in Wellington Channel, discovering the northern peninsula of Devon Island which they named Grinnell in honor of the expedition's benefactor. During November, changing winds carried them back and forth past Beechy Island. In December, the floe made the transit of Lancaster Sound and, on 14 January 1851, they reentered Baffin Bay. Their imprisonment, however, did not end until early June. They had passed Davis Strait in May, and the floe began to break up near the end of the first week in June. Rescue ‚Äì repaired ‚Äì cleared the pack on 7 June 1851. Advance followed the next day. The expedition replenished at Disko Bay and sought to renew the search. However, the ice proved heavier than in the previous year; and prudence dictated that the mission be abandoned for the time being. Therefore, the two ships headed back to the United States. Advance arrived in New York on 30 September 1851, and Rescue reached that port on 7 October. Both ships were returned to Mr. Grinnell, and he immediately began outfitting Advance for another Arctic expedition. Second expedition Preparations for the second Franklin rescue expedition took about 20 months. Advance finally departed New York on 30 May 1853, Passed Assistant Surgeon Elisha Kent Kane in command. The expedition stopped at Upernavik, Greenland, to purchase supplies and, most importantly, sled dogs for searches ashore and on the solidly frozen floes. Continuing north, Advance passed the length of Baffin Bay reaching Smith Sound ‚Äî the northern terminus of Baffin Bay ‚Äî by 7 August. Near the end of August, she reached her northernmost point ‚Äî about 78¬∞43' north latitude ‚Äî in Kane Basin, named for the ship's commanding officer, Passed Assistant Surgeon Kane. At that point, Kane decided to pass the winter among a group of islets near the Greenland coast rather than to return south to some safer harbor. By 10 September, Advance was imprisoned in the ice. The interior of the ship underwent extensive preparations for wintering farther north than any previous expedition. When that was complete, the crew began expeditions across the frozen wastes both on the Greenland shore and the frozen pack. Kane and his officers also established a scientific station to observe climatic conditions and to make astronomical calculations. Their expeditions on foot, however, were hampered by the loss of almost all their sled dogs to disease. In the absence of animal transport, the men themselves carried out the searches and explorations on foot, serving as beasts of burden to manhandle caches of supplies to points which would allow for more distant searches in the future. On one such expedition in late March 1854, four of the party suffered so severely from frostbite that they had to be left behind under the care of a fifth man while the remaining members of the party ‚Äî too physically exhausted to do more than drag their own persons across the frozen wastes ‚Äî headed back to the brig for help. The leader of that group, upon returning to the brig, volunteered to return with the rescue party as a guide. However, his own ordeal caused him to fall victim of a temporary mental disorder and prevented him from rendering any real help. It was only good luck ‚Äî first in finding the advanced party's trail and then in sighting a canvas tent at the site of the disabled men's \\"encampment\\" ‚Äî and their own Herculean efforts that allowed the rescue party to complete their mission. Even that success, however, was marred by the fact that two of the rescued men later succumbed to their infirmities. Fatigue and illness of all associated with the rescue expedition prevented Kane from undertaking further searches until the end of April. During that interlude, Greenlandic Inuit arrived in the area, and Kane bartered with them for additional sled dogs. The four animals he thus obtained allowed him to fit out a single seven-dog team which greatly extended the range of their searches. In his own words, \\"The value of these animals for Arctic ice-travel (sic) can hardly be over-estimated (sic).\\" Through the ensuing summer, search parties ranged the far northern coasts of Greenland and the eastern coast of Ellesmere Island searching for evidence of Sir John Franklin's party and making notes on geography and climate. =Abandonment of the Advance= Advance's crewmen passed the second winter in a state of near hibernation. The difficulties of the previous year had sapped their strength, and their provisions were too scant to restore it. Scurvy ‚Äî that dread disease of the sea ‚Äî riddled their ranks to the point that Kane and one other man \\"... only remained to attend upon the sick, and carry on the daily work of the ship, if that name could still appropriately designate the burrow which we inhabited.\\" The sun returned late in February 1855, and wild game followed it in March. Reasonably adequate food and the sunlight slowly brought the men back some semblance of full strength. At that point, Kane decided to abandon the ship ‚Äî still frozen solidly in the floe ‚Äî and make it across the ice to the Danish settlements of southern Greenland. Shortages of fuel and food, as well as the weakened condition of the crew, made that decision inescapable. Preparations for the journey were multifaceted and complicated. Those capable of work prepared two 25-foot whaleboats and a 13-foot dinghy by mounting them on iron- shod wooden runners and then loading them with provisions. Meanwhile, Kane took the dog sled and team out to an abandoned Inuit hut located some 35 miles from the brig. There, he established an advanced depot to store provisions for the actual journey. During April and the first half of May, he made several trips carrying supplies to his makeshift way station. On 15 May 1855, he began transporting the incapacitated members of the crew to the way station. Two days later, the main group began its torturous trek across the ice hummocks with the three boat-sleds. The main party, without the assistance of dogs, managed a snail's pace of only some three and one-half miles a day. While the main group inched its way, Kane continued his more rapid trips ‚Äî facilitated by the dogs ‚Äî both back to the brig and to an Inuit camp located about 75 miles south of the ship. In this manner, he moved the sick to the way station, brought additional supplies from the ship, and returned from the Inuit camp with fresh game. He last visited the ship on 8 June 1855 and, by the middle of that month, all the sick gradually joined the main party then nearing Littleton Island. The mode of travel again was Kane's dog sled During the journey south toward Cape Alexander, the party suffered numerous breaks through the ice as the spring thaw arrived. At least one man, Acting Carpenter Ohlsen, died from exposure resulting from such an incident. By 18 June, the entire party reached open water at the edge of the floe near Cape Alexander. The journey had netted them only 81 miles in 31 days, but the numerous cutbacks and detours, necessitated by the ice hummocks, resulted in an actual trek of over 300 miles. From that point, they took to the boats. During the next phase of the journey, they alternated between runs across open water under sail and marches across frozen ice hummocks when necessary. By 21 July 1855, the men reached Cape York, the point at which they would begin the transit to Upernavik. There, they erected a rock monument in which they left information regarding their planned movements, a list of provisions on hand, and a brief summary of the expedition's findings. That project completed, Kane and his crew started out across Melville Bay. On 6 August, Kane led his exhausted party into Upernavik. They took passage from Upernavik in the Danish brig Marianne to Disko Island where they were met by the relief expedition made up of and under the command of Lt. Hartstene. The two relief ships brought the survivors into New York on 11 October 1855. Presumably, the pack ice eventually crushed and sank the abandoned Advance.

Playing as a goalkeeper, Swindin made more than 300 appearances in the Football League with Bradford City and Arsenal, where his 18-year career was interrupted by the Second World War. As manager, he led Peterborough United to three Midland League titles before spending a less successful spell with Arsenal. He also managed Norwich City and Cardiff City of the Football League and Kettering Town and Corby Town in non-league football. Playing career Swindin was born in Campsall in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and attended South Grove Central School in Rotherham. He played for England against The Rest as a final trial for a schoolboy international against Wales in 1929, but was not selected. He played as an amateur for various local clubs, including for Rotherham United's reserve team in the Midland League, before turning professional in 1934 with Bradford City. Swindin established himself in the first team towards the end of the 1933‚Äì34 season, but a serious knee injury sustained in the last match of that campaign caused ongoing problems that disrupted his second season and eventually required surgery to remove cartilage. He played 26 Second Division matches for Bradford City, before being signed by Arsenal in April 1936 for ¬£4,000. He made his debut against Brentford on 3 September 1936, and played 19 games in his first season. His time at Arsenal was at first characterised by nervous and erratic displays, and he shared the goalkeeping spot with Alex Wilson and Frank Boulton. However, he played 17 league matches in 1937‚Äì38, more than either of his rivals, as Arsenal won the League title. The Second World War interrupted his career somewhat, but Swindin continued to play through the war for Arsenal, while serving as a Physical Training Instructor in the Army. He made wartime guest appearances for clubs including Leeds United, while serving as a policeman in the area, Clapton Orient, and in 1945, Southampton. By the time first-class football had resumed after the war, he became Arsenal's undisputed No. 1, and stayed there for the next few seasons. He had put his erraticness behind him, and he was a commanding keeper who was especially known for his aerial ability and assured handling of crosses, as well as his strong physical resilience. He won his second League title in 1947‚Äì48. After the arrival of Ted Platt in 1950, Swindin had to share the goalkeeper's spot for 1949‚Äì50, but played in both the 1950 and 1952 FA Cup Finals; Arsenal won the former against Liverpool, but lost to Newcastle United in the latter. By 1952‚Äì53, Swindin was beginning to show his age, and another talented keeper, the Welshman Jack Kelsey, had taken his first-team place. Nevertheless, Swindin played 14 matches that season as Arsenal won the title again, giving him his third Championship winner's medal. Despite his excellent form for Arsenal, he was never capped by England at senior level, with Walter Winterbottom preferring Frank Swift and Bert Williams. In all, he played 297 first-class matches (not including wartime games) for the Gunners. Management career Swindin moved to Midland League side Peterborough United as player-manager in 1954. He led them to three consecutive Midland League titles, from 1955‚Äì56 to 1957‚Äì58, and reached the Fourth Round of the FA Cup in 1956‚Äì57. Peterborough won the title twice more after Swindin left, enough to win election to the Football League in 1960. His contribution was recognised by his induction into the club's Hall of Fame. In the meantime, Swindin had returned to Arsenal in 1958 as manager, and his side initially started strongly, finishing third in 1958‚Äì59. However, the team soon flagged and spent the next three seasons in mid-table. Despite signing players such as George Eastham and Tommy Docherty, Swindin was unable to bring any silverware to the club, while the club's rivals Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960‚Äì61. In March 1962, Arsenal chairman Denis Hill-Wood confirmed that Swindin's contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. He then became manager of Norwich City for five months, and then Cardiff City from late 1962 to 1964. At Cardiff, he signed John Charles from Roma, but after a bright start Cardiff soon faded and he resigned after the team were relegated to the Second Division. After that, he had spells as manager of Kettering Town and Corby Town before leaving the game for good. Final years After leaving football, Swindin first owned a garage in Corby, before emigrating to Spain, where he lived for several years before returning to his homeland. In the later years of his life he suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died at Kettering in October 2005 at the age of 90.

W. Sandstr√∂m, was a Swedish oceanographer and meteorologist. He is most famously known for conducting a series of classical experiments at Born√∂ Marine Research Station in Sweden published in 1908. His experiments concerned themselves with the causes of ocean currents, particularly those found in fjords. Biography Sandstr√∂m is the son of carpenter Jonas Anton Sandstr√∂m and Greta Magdalena Sj√∂gren. He went to Degerfors Elementary School but upon the death of his father, his mother moved the family to Sundsvall, where Sandstr√∂m worked in a sawmill while being tutored. Thanks to local benefactors, he entered a Stockholm technical school, and although he never received an official diploma, he excelled in mathematics and frequented scientific circles. In 1899, Sandstr√∂m joined the national meteorological service where he met Vilhelm Bjerknes, founder of the Bergen School of Meteorology, whom changed his career. The Professor of Mathematical Physics in Stockholm was working on weather forecasting and the theory of the generalized hydrodynamic circulation in the late 1890s. With a grant from the government, Bjerknes engages Sandstr√∂m in 1899 to assist him in the study of the relationship between atmospheric pressure and storms. In a series of publications, Sandstr√∂m analyzes the general atmospheric circulation and develops graphic predictive techniques that make him known. When Bjerknes' grant ended, he was hired by Otto Pettersson as his main assistant at the Swedish Hydrographic and Biological Commission. Pettersson is the chief scientist of the Commission's research vessel fleet. Sandstr√∂m also receives an offer from Fridtjof Nansen in Bergen to help with the book \\"Lehrbuch der Cos-Physen Physik\\" by Svante Arrhenius (1903), to write the part on air masses and dynamic meteorology. Thanks to the grants from Washington's Carnegie Institution, Bjerknes re- engaged Sandstr√∂m for a new and ambitious project in 1906. The following year, he went with Bjerknes to Oslo where they dealt with the physics and mathematics of the subject. In 1908, Sandstr√∂m was hired as technical manager of the new Hydrographic Agency in Stockholm, despite the lack of a diploma, with the help of Bjerknes' recommendation and his own publications. In 1913, he often argued with Nils Ekholm about the value of Bjerknes' meteorological work for real life applications. However, as sailors and farmers started to ask for more weather information, he soon became the director of the new \\"Meteorological Office\\" within the agency in 1919. During the 1920s, aviation began to be an important customer, bringing new data and organizational changes. There was also an increased use of telecommunication technologies, including telegraphy and broadcasting. The Stockholm Meteorological and Hydrological Agency also needed to expand its hydrological functions. Sandstr√∂m then began to study the Gulf Stream, with Pettersson and Ekholm, for its influences on the climate. In 1929, Sandstr√∂m led an expedition to the Arctic Ocean funded by the state and private foundations. In addition to expeditions and a number of personal boat trips in the Arctic, Sandstr√∂m traveled several times in winter to Bergen to meet with Professor Bjerknes to discuss the theory of the weather fronts and air masses. His observations provided him with data on the rate of conversion of energy between the atmosphere and the ocean, which will earn him international recognition. Sandstr√∂m Theorem  Sandstrom was principally concerned with the role of heating and cooling in driving ocean currents, and in the larger-scale ocean circulation in general. He asserted that thermal circulation can cause vigorous, steady circulation only if heating occurs at greater depths than cooling. This is known today as Sandstr√∂m's theorem and represents an attempt at extending the well known result of classical thermodynamic theory that in order for a heat engine to perform positive work over a cycle, the work of expansion needs to occur at greater pressure than the work of contraction. Sandstrom's theorem is therefore technically true, as long as expansion in the fluid is caused by heating and contraction by cooling, and that greater depths occur at greater pressures. There is an ambiguity, however, as to the meaning of the terms 'heating' and 'cooling' in Sandstrom's theorem. So far, heating and cooling has always been interpreted in the literature as being associated with 'surface heating' and 'surface cooling' respectively. In real fluids, however, molecular and turbulent diffusion always cause internal heating/cooling even in absence of external heating/cooling, as long as the temperature of the fluid considered is non-uniform. As is well-known, molecular and turbulent diffusion tends to relax the system toward thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e., toward an isothermal state, which for a statically stable fluid, will warm up the fluid at high pressure, and cool it down at low pressure. Therefore, because of internal diabatic heating/cooling by molecular/turbulent diffusion, the overall heating experienced by a stratified fluid always occurs at greater pressure than the total cooling, even if the external cooling/heating occur at the same pressure. As a result, internal diabatic heating/cooling due to molecular diffusion explains why laboratory experiments show evidence of circulations developing as the result of surface heating/cooling (Park and Whitehead, 2000) or even when the heating is above the cooling (Coman et al., 2006). Sandstr√∂m's key (though not clearly expressed) insight, was that in such circulations, the circulation as a whole must transport light water downwards and dense water upwards. This means that the effect of the circulation is to increase the potential energy. Such an increase requires an external source of energy. Recent work has built on this to argue that the ocean circulation as a whole is driven by these external sources of energy, whether wind or tides, with newer work suggesting that internal sources and sinks of energy (such as those driving diffusion) are also potentially important. Honors In 1925, Sandstr√∂m was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Publications * Sandstrom, J. W. (1908), Dynamische Versuche mit Meerwasser, Ann. Hydrog. Mar.

The district included the towns of Balvi and Abrene and 14 villages, and the civil parishes (Latvian: pagasti) comprising the district were reorganized thrice (there were 12 in 1929, 13 in 1935, and 15 in 1940). During the World War II 6 eastern civil parishes - Purvmalas (Bakovo), Linavas (Linovo), Kacƒìnu (Kachanovo), Upmalas (Upmala), Gauru (Gavry) and Aug≈°pils (Vyshgorodok), as well as the town of Abrene (a total area of 1293.6 square kilometers with 35,524 inhabitants) - were annexed to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1944. This part of the former Abrene district is now part of Russia as the Pytalovsky District of Pskov Oblast, bordering Latvia. \\"Abrene region\\" in current usage very often treats the area joined to Russia as though it had comprised the entire district, which can be misleading; nearly three-quarters of the former district are in Latvia, but many treatments of the transfer of the eastern pagasti cite interbellum demographic statistics for the whole of the region, rather than by civil parish. History The Abrene region was long a point of contact and friction between the Finno-Ugric, Baltic, and Slavic languages, cultures, tribes, and countries. The Russian name for the town and region, Pytalovo, probably derives from the Finno-Ugric tulva, \\"tributary, flood\\"; the region was part of Tolowa (or Tholowa; Latvian: TƒÅlava), a kingdom of the northern Latgalians, which for a period paid tribute to Mstislav the Brave of Smolensk (from ca. 1180); the area became part of Livonia in 1224. In the 1270s the area became a part of Livonia. The Balts east of a slight ridge at Viƒºaka were gradually russified from the 15‚Äì16th centuries, but the philologists August Johann Gottfried Bielenstein and KƒÅrlis Mƒ´lenbahs, conducting linguistic field research in the area in the late 19th and early 20th century, found that many people, called \\"Russian Latvians\\" by the local Russians, still spoke the High Latvian dialect. Abrenes apri≈Üƒ∑is on the map of Latvia (1938). Border changes of Estonia and Latvia in 1944. After the Bolsheviks were driven from what is now Latvia and Soviet Russia recognized Latvia's independence, in August 1920, the border was not drawn alongside ethnographic lines: once the frontier was negotiated (the border was not finalized until April 7, 1923) large Russian and Belarusian communities were left on the Latvian side. Strategic concerns also played a part, because of an important railway junction within the Abrene region. The historian Edgars Andersons explains (in Latvijas vƒìsture 1914‚Äì1920 [Stockholm: Daugava, 1976]): \\"Especially in the north, the Russians had agreed to the Latvians' strategic demands, not complaining about the ethnographic principle having been disregarded. Several civil parishes were completely Russian.\\" The population of the entire district in the census of 1935, divided by ethnicity, was as follows: 60,145 Latvians, 45,885 Russians, 1,558 Jews and 648 Belarusians. The demographics differed sharply on either side of the Viƒºaka ridge, which bisects the district ‚Äì the eastern civil parishes had small ethnic Latvian minorities: 17% in Kacƒìnu pagasts, 5% in Linavas pagasts, 32% in Purvmalas pagasts, 5% in Aug≈°pils pagasts, and 4% in Gauru pagasts. The civil parishes immediately to the west had strong Latvian majorities, ranging from 71% in ≈†ƒ∑ilbƒìnu pagasts to 91% in Viƒºakas pagasts. The town of Abrene itself, which developed around the Pytalovo railroad station, had 1,242 inhabitants, 484 of them ethnic Latvians. The inhabitants held Latvian citizenship regardless of ethnicity. Parliamentary Latvia pursued a liberal policy of multiculturalism, guaranteeing education in minority languages from 1919. Modern schools providing bilingual instruction in Latvian, Russian, Belarusian, Yiddish and Latgalian were constructed (by 1936 there were 162 primary schools and 3 secondary schools in the district). The Latvianization policies of the authoritarian president KƒÅrlis Ulmanis resulted in curtailing multiculturalism after 1934. Many minority schools were closed. The Abrene district as a whole differed from most of Latvia by religion, too ‚Äì it was 48% Orthodox, 38% Catholic, and 12% Lutheran. With the Soviet occupation in 1940, the German invasion in 1941, the Holocaust, the return of Soviet forces in 1944, and the illegal mobilization of Latvian citizens by both occupying powers, severe demographic changes took place. The transfer of the eastern part of the district to the RSFSR was decided by a decree from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, based on a request by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR, in violation of even Soviet law (the 1936 constitution then in force required that changes in internal borders be confirmed by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, not the Presidium). Though the official documents transfer 1075.31 square kilometers, 1293.6 square kilometers were actually transferred. The transfer was not formally finalized until 1946. The territory was subjected to forcible collectivization, accompanied by rampant robbery and destruction, including the demolition of farmsteads and mass mortality among livestock. Kulaks, nationalists, and \\"bandits\\" (often those accused of being Forest Brothers) were deported with their families (2728 persons in early 1949 and 1563 persons in May 1950), primarily to Krasnoyarsk. Officials from Russia proper replaced local administrators even at the village level, and even some who had fought for the Soviets were mistreated. In these circumstances, large numbers of people left for the Latvian SSR. Today there are substantial communities of former residents and their descendants in Balvi and Rƒ´ga. The former civil parishes joined to Russia are almost totally delatvianized. Border agreement  The Latvian constitution stipulates that the borders of the Republic are set by international treaties, and the government considers the 1920 Treaty of Rƒ´ga to be still in force. The May 4th, 1990 declaration of independence (reinstating the 1920 constitution subject to a transitional period) by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR affirmed that the restored Republic of Latvia would base its relations with the Russian Federation on the treaty principle. In January 1991, the Russian Federation (while still in the USSR) and Latvia signed a document regulating their bilateral relations. The Latvian delegation attempted to include a reference to the 1920 treaty but the Russian delegation objected. In essence, Russia views Latvia as a newly independent country and consistently refuses to acknowledge that Latvia was occupied and illegally incorporated into the USSR, while Latvia insists upon the legal continuity of Latvian state occupied in 1940. Key players in post-war politics in the West never recognised or at least questioned the legality of the incorporation of Latvia into the USSR, but there is pressure on both countries to resolve the issue. This can be seen on the example of their attitude towards events from the beginning of the 20th century in Latvia. Thus, the European Community, for example, did not use the term \\"recognition\\" but referred to \\"the restoration of sovereignty and independence\\" when restoring diplomatic relations in 1991; the US to \\"the culmination of the USA‚Äôs 52 year refusal to accept the forcible incorporation of the independent Baltic States by the USSR\\". (See, for example, Roland Rich's paper for the Symposium on Recent Developments in State Recognition.). Pressure on the RF includes the need for Russia to have a border agreement in order to pursue a less draconian visa policy from the EU. The Latvian Foreign Ministry has reiterated \\"that Latvia has no territorial claims to the Russian Federation\\", however, and though there is some opposition (particularly among right wing parties) to formally ceding the Abrene region, surveys show that most Latvians don't believe that the transferred territory will ever again be administered by Latvia. Many in Latvia ‚Äì especially the former residents of the areas now in Russia ‚Äì are interested in seeking compensation from the Russian Federation, though. Currently, the Republic of Latvia compensates those who lost property. The former residents also complain of the difficulty of visiting their family graves, asking that the Latvian and Russian governments facilitate border procedures. Despite Latvia's assurances that it makes no territorial claims, Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed that Latvian wishes to get control of the area and that such claims are against the spirit of Europe. On April 29, 2005, Latvia announced that it would sign an interpretative declaration in conjunction with the proposed border agreement with Russia, noting that the border agreement would in no way affect \\"the legal rights of the Latvian state and its citizens\\" under the 1920 treaty. As a consequence, Russia scrapped the border agreement, as it saw this as attempt to prolong debate on Abrene. In January 2007, the Latvian Parliament agreed to sign the treaty, making no open references to the 1920 treaty. By the end of 2007, the border treaty was ratified by both parties.

Biography Smart was born in London, a nephew of the conductor Sir George Smart and son of a music publisher, orchestra director and accomplished violinist (also called Henry Smart). He was educated at Highgate School, and then studied for the law, but soon gave this up for music. In 1831, Smart became organist of Blackburn parish church, where he wrote his first important work, an anthem; then of St Giles-without-Cripplegate; St Luke's, Old Street; and finally of St Pancras New Church, in 1864, which last post he held at the time of his death, less than a month after receiving a government pension of ¬£100 per annum. Smart was also skilled as a mechanic, and designed several organs.George P Upton, The Standard Cantatas, Echo, 2010 (reprint of 1888 edition), p.190-3. He was also invited by William Sterndale Bennett to join the Committee of his Bach Society leading to the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion in 1854. Though highly rated as a composer by his English contemporaries, Smart is now largely forgotten, save for his hymn tune \\"Regent Square\\", which retains considerable popularity, and which is commonly performed with the words \\"Christ is Made the Sure Foundation\\", \\"Light's Abode, Celestial Salem\\", or \\"Angels from the Realms of Glory\\". His many compositions for the organ (some of which have been occasionally revived in recent years) were described as \\"effective and melodious, if not strikingly original\\" by the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, which also praised his part songs. A cantata by him, \\"The Bride of Dunkerron\\" was written for the Birmingham Festival of 1864; another cantata was a version of the play King Ren√©'s Daughter (1871). The oratorio Jacob was created for Glasgow in 1873; and his opera Bertha was produced with some success at the Haymarket in 1855. Harry Emerson Fosdick greatly admired \\"Regent Square\\", and wrote his own \\"God of Grace and God of Glory\\" specifically in the hope that it would be generally sung to that tune. He was horrified when, in 1935, The Methodist Hymnal instead set the lyrics to Ralph Vaughan Williams' \\"Cwm Rhondda\\". In the last 15 years of his life, Smart was practically blind. He composed by dictation, primarily to his daughter Ellen, who was married to Joseph Joachim's brother Henry Joachim. Smart died at his residence near Primrose Hill in London in July 1879.

Each chapter of the story pays homage to a classic movie or book. Each issue of Matrix Quest was presented with its own symbol on the cover, with a number signifying the episode in the series. However, it was part of the main plot and not a separate mini-comic. The series was reprinted by Marvel UK in issues #262-264 & #282-297 and collected as a trade paperback in 2002. The story The Matrix Quest began when Primus, the Transformers' god and core of their homeworld, Cybertron was reawakened, alerting his nemesis, Unicron to his location. Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader, had deduced that the only thing capable of stopping Unicron was the Creation Matrix, which he had once carried inside his body. The Matrix had been lost with Prime's old body when it had been launched into space for burial. Prime assembles several small teams of Autobots to search different parts of the galaxy for the Matrix. The story takes the form of four individual stories, each focusing on one team. Although the stories do not connect directly to each other, they each detail the ongoing quest and share the common thread of the Decepticon Thunderwing's growing obsession with capturing the Matrix for himself. =Issue #62: Bird of Prey= The Autobot Headmasters - Nightbeat, Siren and Hosehead - start the Matrix Quest on the planet of Pz-zazz. Pz-zazz is a tough, unfriendly world where corruption and crime thrive. The politics of Pz-zazz are in the hands of two criminal lords, Gutt and B'ghdad. However, a third individual, known as Miss Fatale, also wants her cut of the deal. The Autobots' troubles start when a dying alien gives them a mysterious, ancient bird icon. This icon seemingly holds the key to the planet's future, and all three crime bosses are after it. Nightbeat, however, places the bird onto the pedestal from which it was originally stolen, and it restores peace and happiness to the world. At the close of the story, Nightbeat and his companions are captured by Thunderwing and his band of Decepticons. This chapter pays homage to the Humphrey Bogart film, The Maltese Falcon. Just before he hits B'ghdad with the bird Nightbeat said, \\"If you want the bird, you can have it! But if you're its real owner, I'm Peter Lorre!\\" =Issue #63: Kings of the Wild Frontier= The Autobot Triggerbots - Override, Dogfight and Backstreet - arrive on the planet Cheyenne, a world of hot, arid deserts and small, fledgling frontier towns. Upon arriving, the Autobots are met by a band of mounted men, chasing a small child, with the obvious intention of killing him. The Autobots come to the child's rescue, and he invites them to his home. The Autobots succumb to the peaceful life on the alien's farm and quickly forget about the Matrix Quest. However, there's more than meets the eye to this - an encounter with Thunderwing makes Dogfight realise he's not in his right mind any more, so he confronts the host family. The family is revealed to be Vrobians, a malevolent race of psychic vampires. The riders the Autobots met earlier were actually a kind of policemen, seeking to arrest the Vrobians. A fight ensues, and the Autobots win. This chapter references several cowboy movies. The title may also be a reference to the 1980 Adam and the Ants album of the same name. =Issue #64: Deadly Obession= The Autobot Pretenders - Longtooth, Doubleheader and Pincher - arrive on the planet Pequod, which is a world of vast seas. While cruising on a ship over the oceans, Longtooth encounters a large whale-like creature called a Klud, which bites off his leg, rendering him catatonic. No longer in his right mind, he becomes obsessed with hunting it down and killing it for revenge, while the other two Autobots try to stop him. Longtooth's second encounter with the Klud is interrupted by a Decepticon attack. After defeating the Decepticons, Longtooth's comrades make him see reason, and he spares the Klud's life. Meanwhile, Thunderwing has come in contact with the Klud, and has somehow learned that the Klud has been in contact with the Matrix - and thus, Thunderwing knows where the Matrix is. This chapter pays homage to the novel, Moby-Dick. =Issue #65: Dark Creations= Optimus Prime's body, along with the Matrix, has landed on a moon called Vs'Qs. Vs'Qs is a desolate, almost lifeless place, inhabited only by small vermin, and a human research outpost. However, when the Autobot Pretender Classics - Bumblebee, Jazz and Grimlock - arrive on Vs'Qs, they find that something has killed the outpost's entire crew. The Autobots face Thunderwing and his Decepticons, but while they fight, a native creature finds the Matrix and tries to escape with it. Thunderwing hunts the creature down and kills it, stealing the Matrix. He then hijacks the Autobots' shuttle and flies back to The Ark, where he attacks Optimus Prime. This chapter pays homage to Ridley Scott's movie, Alien, and particularly to the sequel, Aliens. The story also contains a reference to the character of Deathbringer, an alien being mutated by the Matrix that the Autobots faced in a Marvel UK story. This marks one of the few direct references that Furman made to his Marvel UK continuity after he began writing the US comic. =Issue #66: All Fall Down= An Autobot shuttle returns to the Ark and Prime can sense the Matrix aboard. However, when the shuttle opens, it reveals a fighting mad Thunderwing, who has taken the Matrix for himself after overpowering the Autobots in the high gravity of Vs'Qs. Thunderwing battles the entire Ark crew, as Prime hesitates, unwilling to risk damage to the Matrix. Presently, the Matrix itself makes itself known, taking over control of Thunderwing's body and revealing itself to have been corrupted by evil. The Autobots are unable to resist the power of the Dark Matrix until Nightbeat, imprisoned since Issue #62, shoots Thunderwing with a grappling harpoon from the shuttle and depressurises the shuttlebay, sucking Thunderwing and the Matrix out into deep space. The Autobots are left to face Unicron without the Matrix.

Etymology Accounts of the origin of Pytalovo's name reflect the region's dichotomy. The unofficial Pytalovo website offers two possibilities for the origin of the town's name,Unofficial website of Pytalovo. –û –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ neither based in any verifiable historical facts. One is that it was named for Lieutenant Pytalov, a guard to Catherine the Great, who received the lands in 1766 for reasons unknown, that estate subsequently being sold off by his descendants. The other is that the name \\"speaks for itself\\" (i.e., it is derived from the Russian verb \\"\\", to torture), named for a church courtyard with a large iron cross used to torture and execute people. A viable historical explanation is that Pytalovo is Russified Latvian for \\"PietƒÅlava\\" (Latvian \\"pie TƒÅlavas\\", or Latgalian \\"pƒ´ Tuolavas\\"), meaning \\"near TƒÅlava\\", with TƒÅlava being the name of an ancient Latvian feudal state.D. Eglitis quoting historian Edgars Andersons in Imagining the Nation: History, Modernity, and Revolution in Latvia. Penn State Press, 2002. Russophones comprised the majority of the population in a number of parishes during Latvia's initial independence, with further Russification ongoing. Nevertheless, the older generation testified to their Latvian heritage.LatviskƒÅ Jaunlatgale' , V. Krasnais, \\"LatviskƒÅ Jaunlatgale, Apgabala Vƒìsturiskie Likte≈Üi, retrieved June 22, 2013; also available at ; local community leader A. Briedis recounted during the period: \\"Nevertheless, the older generation in these parishes completely confirms that in older times they had spoken Latvian and that the Russians had called them Latvians. But now, as the older generation passes on, children are being educating in Russian schools as Russians even under Latvia\\". Historian Carl von Stern wrote of a cultural awakening amongst the region's inhabitants in the 1930s despite generations of Russification. Two thousand inhabitants from across Pskov gathered in September 1934 and proclaimed: \\"We are not Russian, but, indeed, Latvian. We are returning to our Latvian heritage. Latvians, lend us your helping hand, support and hasten our return!\\" Audiences wept as they heard old familiar folk songs sung with words and a language lost over time. A more concrete testament to Pytalovo's Latvian heritage is that the Latvian folk costumes of the region are the only ones which still preserve the most ancient tradition of white dress, once used in both daily life and for festive occasions.\\"–ù–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∏–π —Ç–æ–º—É –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥ –æ–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞ –±–µ–ª–æ–≥–æ —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –±—ã–ª–∞ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∞ –ø–æ –≤—Å–µ–π —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –õ–∞—Ç–≤–∏–∏. –¢–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –ê–±—Ä–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —ç—Ç–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—Å—è –µ–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º, –≥–¥–µ –µ—â–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Ç–∞–∫—É—é –æ–¥–µ–∂–¥—É. –•–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –±–µ–ª—ã–º–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–∞–∑–¥–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –Ω–∞—Ä—è–¥, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∞—è –æ–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞.\\" from Abrene Women's Folk Costume, Latvian State Printing House, Riga. ca. 1960 History Pytalovo, alternatively known as Novo-Dmitrovskoye (), a rural locality in Vyshgorodok volost, Ostrovsky Uyezd, Pskov Governorate, had been known since the end of the 18th century. In the last quarter of the 19th century, it had a population of 59. It grew significantly after gaining a railway station by a newly constructed railway branch. In February 1918 the German Army advances on Pskov and Petrograd capturing Pytalovo until fall 1918, when the Red Army retakes it. In May 1919 –≥. advancing pro-czarist Russian North-Western Army of Gen. Nikolai Yudenich supported by Estonian and Latvian republican units recaptures westernmost part of the Pskov Governorate. The frontline as of noon the 1st of February 1920 was stipulated as the border demarcation line by the Latvian‚ÄìSoviet Peace Treaty of 1920 between Latvian Republic and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. By the Latvian‚ÄìSoviet Peace Treaty of 1920, a part of Ostrovsky Uyezd, including Pytalovo, was passed to Latvia. In 1925, Latvians renamed it Jaunlatgale, which it was known as until 1938, when the name was changed to Abrene. In 1933, it was granted town status. During the interwar period, it was the administrative center of Abrene District. After the annexation of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1940, the town originally remained a part of the Latvian SSR. During World War II, the town was occupied by the German Army from July 5, 1941 until July 22, 1944 and administered as part of the Generalbezirk Lettland of Reichskommissariat Ostland. On January 16, 1945, the town and the surrounding areas were transferred to Pskov Oblast of the Russian SFSR and Pytalovsky District was established.Administrative-Territorial Structure of Pskov Oblast, p. 14 At the same time, the town's original name (Pytalovo) was restored. Whether the region is historically Russian or Latvian became a highly politicized issue after Latvia restored its independence in 1991 and a border dispute erupted with Russia over the region. The Abrene District, constituting roughly 2% of Latvia's territory, was transferred to the Russian SFSR in 1945, but it had originally been a part of Russia and ceded to Latvia only a quarter century earlier, in 1920. Russian President Vladimir Putin famously uttered in 2005 that Latvia \\"will get the ears of a dead donkey but not Pytalovo [Abrene]\\".R. Mole. The Baltic States from the Soviet Union to the European Union: Identity, Discourse and Power in the Post-Communist Transition of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Routledge, 2012. The border dispute was not resolved until 2007, when a treaty between Latvia and Russia recognizing the existing border was signed. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Pytalovo serves as the administrative center of Pytalovsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #833-oz stipulates that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. The Law #420-oz, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal districts, lists the town of Pytalovo as a part of Pytalovsky District. As a municipal division, the town of Pytalovo is incorporated within Pytalovsky Municipal District as Pytalovo Urban Settlement.Law #420-oz Economy =Industry= As of 2003, only two industrial enterprises survived in Pytalovo‚Äîa textile factory and a printing house. A milk factory and a flax production factory, previously the biggest enterprises in the district, were defunct. =Transportation= Railway station Pytalovo is an important railway station on the railway from St. Petersburg via Pskov to Rƒìzekne in Latvia and further to Vilnius. In Pytalovo, another railway to Gulbene and Riga branches off west. As of 2012, there was passenger traffic on the railway. Pytalovo has an easy access to the European route E262, from Ostrov to Kaunas via Rƒìzekne and Daugavpils. Culture Among places of interest in town Pytalovo there is a railway station building built in the modernist style in the early 20th century, the wooden building of the functioning St. Nicholas Church built in 1931, the post office building (early 20th century), and the house of merchant Ilyin (built in the 1920s). Pytalovo is home to an ethnographic museum focusing on Russian and Latgalian cultures.

The cult of Mar√≠a Lionza is a blend of African, indigenous and Catholic beliefs. She is revered as a goddess of nature, love, peace and harmony. She has followers throughout Venezuelan society, from small rural villages to Caracas, where a monumental statue stands in her honor. The Cerro Mar√≠a Lionza Natural Monument (also known as Sorte mountain) where an important pilgrimage takes place every October, was named in her honour.  Legend and symbols  According to the main legend, Mar√≠a Lionza was born in the 15th‚Äì16th century as the daughter of an indigenous chief from the region of Yaracuy. His father sent her to live in the Sorte mountain. One day, while she was by the river, an anaconda attacked and devoured her. From within the serpent, Mar√≠a Lionza begged the mountain for help. The mountain agreed, Mar√≠a Lionza thus disintegrated and merged with Sorte mountain. Sometimes the anaconda is said to have exploded and caused torrential rains, that are common in the region. Mar√≠a Lionza is sometimes portrayed as an indigenous woman and sometimes as pale-skinned with green eyes, usually surrounded by animals. She is often depicted naked riding a tapir. Mar√≠a Lionza is sometimes called Yara, an indigenous alternative name. According to some versions, Yara would have taken the name Santa Mar√≠a de la Onza Talavera del Prato de N√≠var or simply Santa Mar√≠a de la Onza (\\"Saint Mary of the Ounce\\") under Catholic influence during the Spanish colonization of Venezuela. Subsequently, her name would have been shortened to \\"Mar√≠a Lionza\\". Cult and pilgrimage The indigenous rites of Mar√≠a Lionza take place in the Sorte mountain, near the town of Chivacoa in Yaracuy state, Venezuela. The origins of the cult are uncertain, it is a syncretism of Indigenous, Catholic and African beliefs. Traditions of trance communication (seeking to channel the soul of dead people in a living body) may have started about 19th and 20th century in Latin America, popularized by the teachings of the 19th century Frenchman Allan Kardec. Angelina Pollok-Eltz from Andr√©s Bello Catholic University in Venezuela, who has worked on the subject, says that the rituals in Sorte started in the early 1920s and were brought to urban areas a decade later. Maria Lionza followers travel to the mountain for a week each October 12 during the national Day of Indigenous Resistance. In 2011, estimates indicated that about 10% to 30% Venezuelan were followers of the cult. At the time, Venezuelan authorities indicated that about 200 thousands followers participated in the traditions, including foreigners coming from the Americas and Europe. In 2011, Wade Glenn, an anthropologist from Tulane University in the United States, estimated that about 60% of Venezuelan population may have participated in the cult of Mar√≠a Lionza at some point. Glenn argues that the conversational aspect of the rituals may have therapeutical effects. Members from all Venezuelan social classes participate in the rituals. In local reports, the rituals have been considered to be linked with the late president of Venezuela Hugo Ch√°vez, yet there is little to no evidence. Ch√°vez himself said he did not take part in it, and some followers of Mar√≠a Lionza have said to support him while others dislike Ch√°vez. Some analysts argue that the decline of political power of the Catholic Church during Ch√°vez, alongside with the crisis in Venezuela, may have lead many Venezuelans to seek for help and join the cult. The hyperinflation in Venezuela that started in 2016 has affected the rituals as many are unable to access the materials necessary to carry out the ceremonies. = Traditions and spiritism = Altar dedicated to Mar√≠a Lionza, Negro Felipe and Guaicaipuro. The trinity of characters is known as the Tres Potencias. The followers call themselves Marialionceros and refer Mar√≠a Lionza as. the \\"Queen\\" (). People go to Sorte mountain seeking for strength, healing and to contact the souls of dead people. During the pilgrimage, the principal shamans and priests of Mar√≠a Lionza come together to pay homage. Many followers wear indigenous costumes and perform a traditional fire walking dance called the \\"dance of hot coals\\" (). Several spirits are also worshipped during the rituals alongside Catholic saints. Mar√≠a Lionza is one of the main \\"three powers\\" (), which also include Guaicaipuro, a legendary indigenous resistance leader of 16th century, and Negro Felipe, a black Afro-American soldier that allegedly participated in the Venezuelan War of Independence. The lower spirits, usually referred as brothers () by the pilgrims, are arranged into 'courts', divided by identity: Indigenous, African, Viking, Liberator. The spirits include farmers, modern criminals and famous historical figures, like Venezuela 19th century liberator Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Many followers cleanse themselves in the muddy rivers to receive the spirits. Shamans take the role of mediums between the pilgrims and the spirits, and usually demand their followers to enter into a trance state which often leads them to speak in tongues or harming themselves. The shamans and the Marialionceros employ blessings, cursing, drum playing, cigar smoking, tabaco chewing, and local liquors during the yearly rituals. Various sources have reported sightings of shamans, sometimes wearing horned helmets, claiming to have contacted the legendary Viking Eric the Red, the first Norse explorer to discover Greenland. Many members from other religions native to Latin America and Venezuela are present, primarily Santeros (a syncretism between African Yoruba beliefs and Catholicism, known for sacrificing animals to pay homage to Orishas) and Paleros (a syncretic Afro-Cuban religion centered on communicating with the dead).  Monument in Caracas  Frontal perspective of Alejandro Colina's statue of Mar√≠a Lionza in Caracas (picture from 2007). One of the most iconic portrayals of Mar√≠a Lionza is the 1951 monument in the Francisco Fajardo Highway in Caracas by Venezuelan sculptor Alejandro Colina. It portrays Mar√≠a Lionza as a muscular naked woman, riding a large tapir which is standing on a snake. Lionza holds a female pelvis, representing fertility, high above her head. The statue was made for the 1951 Bolivarian Games, to sit outside the Central University of Venezuela (UCV)'s Olympic Stadium, and the Olympic flame was held in the pelvis at the top of the statue during this event. The statue had been commissioned by the dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, who wanted to make Mar√≠a Lionza a symbol of Venezuela. The statue was moved to the highway in 1953, after the university and P√©rez Jim√©nez became concerned that the accessible campus location would allow Mar√≠a Lionza's devotees to gather and spread indigenous religion in Venezuela.  In popular culture  Rub√©n Blades and Willie Col√≥n's salsa song \\"Mar√≠a Lionza\\", from their 1978 album Siembra, is dedicated to the Venezuelan deity. Former Miss Venezuela Ruddy Rodr√≠guez was the protagonist of Mar√≠a Lionza, a 2006 Venezuelan TV film. In 2009, the New Weird America musician Devendra Banhart composed \\"Mar√≠a Lionza\\", published in his album What Will We Be, as an \\"evocation to the goddess.\\"  Notes  References South American deities Religion in Venezuela Venezuelan culture Peace goddesses Health goddesses Love and lust goddesses Nature goddesses Latin American folklore Latin American culture Shamanism of the Americas Folk saints 1802 births ","title":"Mar√≠a Lionza"},{"id":"1791045","text":"Sir Antony George Anson Fisher (28 June 1915 ‚Äì 8 July 1988), nicknamed AGAF, was a British businessman and think tank founder. He participated in the formation of various libertarian organisations during the second half of the twentieth century, including the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Atlas Network. Through Atlas, he helped establish up to 150 other institutions worldwide. Early life Antony Fisher was born on 28 June 1915.John Blundell, Ladies for Liberty: Women who Made a Difference in American History, New York City: Algora Publishing, 2011, chapter 20: 'Dorian Fisher', pp. 195‚Äì200 He was only two years old when his father was killed by a sniper in Gaza during World War I.Founder's Story, Atlas Economic Research FoundationGerald Frost, Antony Fisher: Champion of Liberty, Profile Books, 2002, condensed by David Moller He was educated at Eton College. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge with a degree in engineering. During the Second World War, he served as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force., being awarded the Air Force Cross. Career After World War II, he was alarmed by the election of a Labour government, the nationalisation of industry, and the introduction of central economic planning. In 1945, Fisher had read Road to Serfdom by Austrian economist F. A. Hayek which influenced his thinking. Fisher sought out Hayek at the London School of Economics where he taught and talked about his plans to go into politics. Hayek, however, convinced him that think-tanks were the best medium for effecting political change. In 1952, he undertook a study trip to the United States, where he visited the new Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). F. A. Harper of the FEE introduced Fisher to former colleagues from the Agriculture Department of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who showed him intensive chicken farming techniques. Fisher was very impressed and returned to start England's first battery cage chicken farm, Buxted Chickens, which eventually made him a millionaire. In 1955, he used his fortune to set up the influential Institute of Economic Affairs with Ralph Harris. Some of Fisher's other business ventures did not succeed (including a turtle-farming operation). In 1971 Fisher founded the International Institute for Economic Research, which went to spawn both the Atlas Network in 1981 and the International Policy Network in 2001. Through these operations, Fisher provided financial and operational support for a huge number of fledgling think-tanks, most of which would not exist without his influence. It was through the Atlas Network that Fisher was able to extend his beliefs worldwide. By 1984, Fisher was watching over eighteen institutions in eleven countries.Early history As of 2017, Atlas supports and works with nearly 500 free-market think-tanks in over 90 different countries. In his book Thinking the Unthinkable, Richard Cockett sketched Fisher's role in supporting other emerging think-tanks around the world. Cockett wrote, \\"On the strength of his reputation with the IEA, he was invited in 1975 to become co-director of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver, founded by the Canadian businessman T. Patrick Boyle in 1974. Fisher let the young director of the Fraser Institute, Dr Michael Walker, get on with the intellectual output of the Institute (just as he had given free rein to Seldon and Harris at the IEA) while he himself concentrated on the fund-raising side\\". Cockett explained that after his success at the Fraser Institute, Fisher went to New York where in 1977 he set up the International Center for Economic Policy Studies (ICEPS), later renamed the Manhattan Institute. \\"The incorporation documents for the ICEPS were signed by prominent attorney Bill Casey, later Director of the Central Intelligence Agency\\". Cockett comments that \\"under the directorship of William Hammett the Manhattan Institute became probably Fisher's greatest success after the IEA\\". In 1977, Cockett wrote, Fisher moved to San Francisco \\"with his second wife Dorian, who he had met through the Mont Pelerin Society, and founded the Pacific Research Institute in 1979\\" and Fisher and Milton Friedman lived in the same apartment block in San Francisco during the 1980s. In the late 1970s, Fisher assisted Greg Lindsay in the development of the Centre for Independent Studies in Sydney. Cockett wrote, \\"In 1981, to co-ordinate and establish a central focus for these institutes that Fisher found himself start up all over the world, he created the Atlas Economic Research Foundation which in 1987 joined up with the Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) (founded by the Mont Pelerin member F. A. Harper in 1961) to provide a central institutional structure for what quickly became an ever-expanding number of international free-market think- tanks or research institutes\\". According to Cokett, \\"Fisher used the local and international gatherings of the Mont Pelerin Society to find personnel, fund- raisers and donors for many of the Atlas Institutes\\" as the international think-tanks proliferated. He was a co-founder of the Fraser Institute, the Manhattan Institute, the Pacific Research Institute, the National Center for Policy Analysis, the Centre for Independent Studies, and the Adam Smith Institute. He was knighted four weeks before his death. Personal life He was married twice. He had four children with his first wife, including Linda Whetstone, who has been involved with many of Fisher's think tanks. His granddaughter, Rachel Whetstone, serves as senior vice-president of communications and public policy for Uber. His second wife, Dorian Fisher, was George N. Crocker's widow. Death He died on 8 July 1988 in San Francisco, California. References Bibliography *Cockett, Richard (1995). Thinking the Unthinkable: Think-Tanks and the Economic Counter-Revolution, 1931‚Äì1983.

Jackson). He is a host on SiriusXM Radio's The 80s on 8 channel and co-owns the production company Hunter Films with his brother Hugh. He and Hugh and two other brothers also founded WorkPlay, a multipurpose office, studio and entertainment facility in Birmingham, Alabama. He also hosted the reality show Looking for Stars on the Starz cable television channel as well as the Encore series ‚ÄúBig 80s Weekend‚Äù. Biography =Early life and career= Born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1957, Hunter graduated from Mountain Brook High School in 1975 and earned his BA in Psychology in 1979 from Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi. During his senior year he got his first television acting job in the ABC Movie of the Week Love's Savage Fury, starring Raymond Burr, Jennifer O'Neill and Michael Par√©. After a stint as a professional actor at the Birmingham Children's Theatre, he moved to New York City to attend Circle in the Square drama school. Afterwards, he held a series of \\"struggling actor\\" gigs: bartender, waiter, phone answering service attendant and a handful of Off Off Broadway roles, finally earning a role in the music video for David Bowie's \\"Fashion\\" for which he was paid $50 a day and got to meet Bowie. He also had a bit part (on cutting room floor) in the film musical Annie. =MTV= In the early summer of 1981, he bumped into MTV exec Bob Pittman at a picnic in Central Park. A month later, Hunter was tapped to join the fledgling MTV, only three weeks prior to its debut. MTV went on the air August 1, 1981, at midnight in selected markets across America. Hunter was, by technical snafu, the first VJ to appear on screen, with the words \\"Hi, I'm Alan Hunter. I'll be with you right after Mark. We'll be covering the latest in music news, coast to coast, here on MTV Music Television.\\" And then the other original VJs ‚Äì Martha Quinn, J.J. Jackson, Nina Blackwood and Mark Goodman ‚Äì followed. During his first month with MTV, he kept his regular night job tending bar at New York's Magic Pan Restaurant Cabaret. When a customer recognized him, he determined it was time to become a full-time MTV VJ. Over the next several years Hunter's typical work week included attending concerts and parties until the wee hours and then coming back to the studio at 8:00 AM for a full day of taping interviews, promos and features. Hunter was also heavily involved in the WWF- MTV collaboration, hosting The War to Settle the Score live special on MTV with Gene Okerlund. He also conducted backstage interviews for the show. Hunter also narrated The War Continues, a special produced by MTV that was used to help promote Wrestlemania on in March 1985. As MTV became a dominant outlet for music-related content in the early 1980s, Hunter's celebrity interviews included the first MTV interviews with Madonna, Duran Duran and U2, and also included Ozzy Osbourne, Frank and Moon Unit Zappa, Daryl Hall & John Oates, Loverboy, Kasim Sultan, Crosby Stills & Nash, Kevin Bacon, Robin Williams, Dan Aykroyd, Eurythmics, Kenny Loggins, the Psychedelic Furs, Bob & Doug McKenzie, Lou Reed, Joey Ramone, Andy Warhol, the Cars, the GoGos, the Bangles, Colin Hay and Men at Work, Boy George, Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, John Mellencamp, Hugh Hefner, Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Rod Stewart, Cheap Trick, Billy Idol, Thomas Dolby, Joe Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, Crowded House, Aretha Franklin, Michael McDonald, Rick Springfield, Peter Wolf, Toto, Level 42, Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, Martin Short, Chevy Chase and Pee-Wee Herman among others. In his latter MTV years, Hunter became known for his remotes and road trips in such iconic and pioneering MTV programming like MTV Spring Break, MTV's Amuck in America and MTV's Hedonism Weekend with Bon Jovi in Jamaica. =Life after MTV= In August 1987, after six years with the channel, Hunter departed MTV as a full-time host and relocated from New York to Los Angeles. The same year, he traveled to Russia in September as a freelancer for the channel for a program called Rock in Russia. The documentary explored the world of rock music in the midst of President Gorbachev's perestroika in the Soviet Union while following Billy Joel on his pioneering concert tour to Moscow and Leningrad. In 1989, he appeared in the film White Hot. For the years he was in Los Angeles, Hunter starred in numerous Fox pilots, like HayWire and Pure Insanity, precursors of today's reality programming, as well as commercials for Levi's Dockers and Chevrolet and numerous infomercials for Time-Life. In the mid-'90s he moved back to his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, to start a film company called Hunter Films, and, with his brothers, to create the multi-use entertainment facility, WorkPlay, named one of America's 40 Best Venues by Paste Magazine. In 2003, Hunter Films produced the Academy Award-nominated short film Johnny Flynton directed by Lexi Alexander, and executive produced the 2006 Sundance premiered movie Dreamland starring John Corbett, Gina Gershon and Justin Long. 2010 saw the release of the company's executive produced documentary Best Worst Movie and in 2011 the feature film Lifted, which they co-produced and in which Hunter co-stars with Dash Mihok, Nicki Aycox, Ruben Studdard, Trace Adkins and in which Uriah Shelton debuted. Amidst his entrepreneurial endeavors, in 2005-06 Hunter continued his work as a TV host working with Encore and Starz for their first original series Looking for Stars. He was part of a Verizon Wireless national radio campaign for three years and since 2004 has been on SiriusXM Radio's The 80s on 8 (4:00 pm ‚Äì 7:00 pm) music channel along with the other surviving original MTV VJs. Hunter co-founded Birmingham's Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival, named by Time Magazine as one of the top ten Festivals for the Rest of Us and serves as its board president. He launched the civic activist group Catalyst4Birmingham and has been an integral part of promoting the film business in the state of Alabama lobbying for legislation to create film incentives as well as the creation of the Birmingham-Jefferson Film Office.

In liturgical Christian churches, this feast of St. Mark is observed on 25 April of each year; thus St. Mark's Eve is 24 April. English folklore It was the custom in villages in England, from the 17th century to the late 19th century, to sit in the church porch on St. Mark's Eve. Those sitting had to keep silent between the bell tolling at 11.00 p.m. until the bell struck 1.00 a.m. In Yorkshire it was necessary to keep vigil for three successive nights. On the third such sitting, it was said that the ghosts of those to die during the year would be witnessed passing into the church. This practice took place throughout England, but was most prevalent in northern and western counties. Some accounts of the custom state that the watchers must be fasting, or must circle the church before taking up position. The ghosts of those who were to die soon would be the first observed, while those who would almost see out the year would not be witnessed until almost 1.00 a.m. Other variations of the superstition say that the watchers would see headless or rotting corpses, or coffins approaching. Another tradition holds that a young woman can see the face of her future husband appear on her smock by holding it before the fire on St Mark's Eve.

The mountain is located in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness of White River National Forest, north by northeast (bearing 30¬∞) of the community of Redstone in Pitkin County, Colorado, United States. Mountain Mount Sopris is located in western Pitkin County, south of Carbondale and southwest of the confluence of the Crystal and Roaring Fork rivers. Mount Sopris is notable for having two summits, East Sopris and West Sopris, that are one-half mile (0.8 km) apart and have the same elevation of .The peaks are connected by a saddle at elevation of about 12,660 feet, giving them a relative prominence of just around 300 feet. Hence by the usual 300 foot prominence rule for Colorado summits, the two summits are on the borderline of being considered separate peaks. It is named for Richard Sopris, a former mayor of Denver and part of the first European expedition in the Roaring Fork Valley. In 2011 J.P. McDaniels petitioned to rename East Sopris \\"Mount John Denver\\" after the Colorado singer. A local poll in Aspen and Carbondale said 74 percent of the respondents were against the proposal. Mount Sopris is believed to have been formed by an igneous intrusion 10,000 feet below the earth's surface, geologically referred to as a pluton, that occurred around 30 million years ago, after the initial uplift of the modern Rocky Mountains. Mount Sopris is not a volcano, but it is possible that an ancient volcano sat above it, with the current rock forming the magma chamber far below. Due to subsequent continued erosion, any evidence is now gone. In either case, the rock that makes up Sopris never reached the surface, cooling and crystallizing in situ, and later becoming exposed due to erosion. Nearby prominent peaks Mount Gunnison and Crested Butte are believed to have formed similarly. Mount Sopris dominates the skyline of Carbondale and the lower Roaring Fork Valley, serving as an unofficial symbol of the area. It is prominently visible from State Highway 82 in the vicinity of Carbondale. In terms of local relief, it is one of the largest peaks in the state of Colorado. For example, West Sopris rises 6,400 ft (1,905 m) above the valley to the west in only 2.7 mi (4 km). (One can compare this to the corresponding vertical rise of the more well-known Maroon Peak in the heart of the Elks: it rises only about 4,300 ft (1,310 m), at best, in the same horizontal distance.) In fact a vertical rise of over 6,000 feet in less than 3 miles is rare and impressive anywhere in the contiguous United States.Fred Beckey, Cascade Alpine Guide, The Mountaineers. Looking North West from Mt. Sopris Hiking/Climbing The Mount Sopris Trail ascends to East Sopris via its east ridge. It starts near Dinkle Lake, on the northeast side of the mountain, and passes between the two Thomas Lakes just before reaching timberline. The ascent involves about 4,300 ft (1,300 m) of vertical gain (plus 600 ft/180 m for a round-trip to West Sopris, if desired) and 12 mi (20 km) of hiking (plus 1 mi/1.6 km for West Sopris); it is a strenuous trail hike, with some scree.

He is the father of political author Anthony Seldon. Biography Arthur Seldon was born Abraham Margolis in the East End of London to Masha and Pinhas Margolis. They came to Britain from Kiev fleeing the anti-semitic pogroms in 1903 or 1904. Abraham was probably born at Mrs Levy's Maternity Home, Petticoat Lane, near Aldgate, London. Masha and Pinchas Margolis were married in Kiev; he was probably born at Perioslav, a village near Kiev. The family were very poor: Pinchas worked making caps at a Jewish immigrant's factory called Goldstein & Co, Commercial Road, Stepney and, they lived at 12 Marks Street, Aldgate. It was not until after they moved to 13 Beeford Street, Stepney that Abraham was actually born. His oldest brother Jack was born in 1906, and a sister Bess in 1910; brothers Susman and Solly Margolis changed their names to Cecil Margolis and Sidney Margolis respectively; only Abraham changed his whole name. His mother Masha had two brothers Ben and Morris Kopelolt who had also come to London as refugees. When his parents both died in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, his uncle‚Äôs families took the boys in, and then sent them away to school. Abraham was put up for adoption by a cobbler, Pinchas Slaberdain, and his wife Eva at 154 Oxford Street, Commercial Road, Stepney. Arthur Seldon never forgot where he came from, and the intense poverty that had shaped his family's arrival in this country. But rather than turning for help to socialism he worked hard, first at school, and then to get a tertiary education becoming self-reliant. Aged only eight he remembered cheering on the Labour candidate for Stepney in the 1924 General election campaign. Abraham was educated at elementary school Sir Henry Raine's Grammar School. There in 1928 he was impressed by History master E J Hayward's interpretation of cottage industry's transition to capitalism. A scholarship paid for the London School of Economics where he read Friedrich Hayek, Arnold Plant and Lionel Robbins served to deepen his interest in classical liberalism. Friedrich Hayek's Road to Serfdom introduced him to Austrian economics. Seldon helped found the small university's student Liberal Society. Nonetheless he retained anti-fascist principles as war drew nearer. He served with the army in North Africa and Italy during the war. Arthur married Marjorie in 1948, and continued to be involved with the Liberal Party. He was chairman of its committee on the elderly from 1948 to 1949. Seldon was working at the Brewer's Society in 1956 when approached by Lord Grantchester to be asked if he wanted to join a new 'Think Tank' just set up by Antony Fisher on the advice of Friedrich Hayek, founder of the Chicago School of economics and champion of free market neoliberalism. Seldon wrote a first pamphlet still only 20 years of age, called \\"The Intellectuals and Socialism\\" (1937) in which he criticised the keynesian state and its bureaucracy as \\"second hand dealers in ideas.\\"Colin Robinson, Arthur Seldon: A Life of Liberty, Profile Books, (London, 2009), pp. 35, 60 Ralph Harris was appointed General Director of the new Institute of Economic Affairs and Arthur was Editorial Adviser. Antony, later Lord Fisher left a legacy of think tanks that he had founded all around the world. \\"The State Versus Market\\" pamphlet was published when he was still only twenty years old, based on a book review, it explained the benefits of market competition. Seldon joined the Liberal Party. He was on a Committee of Enquiry chaired by Elliott Dodds into the distribution of property, exploring the idea of \\"ownership for all,\\" and the effects of statist maldistribution. In \\"The Drift to Corporate State\\" he severely criticised the corporatist industrial policy being against state monopoly. It was an idea endorsed by the Liberal Assembly ten years earlier in 1948. In another pamphlet in 1957, the IEA published \\"Pensions in a Free Society\\" commented freely on the Liberal Beveridge Report of 1942 into founding of the state pension system. Seldon generated editorial copy: edited recruited authors, made available titles to a wider audience. Pamphlets were of between 10,000 and 15,000 words and as such represented a new form of political literature. It was also Seldon's inspiration to produce series, such as Hobart Papers, Occasional Papers, and Readings etc. Seldon was also involved in the famous Orpington by-election in 1962, in which the Liberal Party gained the seat from the Conservative Party and weakened the confidence of the Macmillan administration. A neoliberal free marketeer, he influenced the policies of Margaret Thatcher. In 1970 Seldon invited Milton Friedman at the IEA, quick to recognise the value of monetarist policy. The ideas imported from Chicago had a great influence on members of the Conservative party, especially Enoch Powell, Sir Keith Joseph, and Margaret Thatcher. Public Choice Theory analysed the relations between the State and voluntary activity. He organised a conference in 1978 called \\"Economics in Britain\\" ‚Äì the American economist James Buchanan, founder of Public Choice was invited. In 1980 Seldon founded the IEA's \\"Economic Journal\\". Seldon gained a reputation as an exceptionally competent editor. He would, according to Ralph Harris, re-write poor pamphlets to such an extent as to almost become its co-author. In \\"Vote Motive\\" he found a voice that was most profound and influential, shaping the post-modern ethos for electioneering and party politics. Seldon won the Fisher Arts Literary Prize in 1991, although it was established by the founder of IEA, so nobody minded the eternal paradox, for his book Capitalism. He received an honorary degree in 1999 from the University of Buckingham. * Institute of Economic Affairs, Editorial Adviser, and later founder-president * Mont Pelerin Society, vice- president * Hayek Society, global advisory council * Locke Institute, editorial director Arthur Seldon is the father of the historian Anthony Seldon. = In the media = Seldon's widow Marjorie was interviewed about his work at the IEA and the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series Tory!

Mee was also a manager, noted for leading Arsenal to their first Double win in 1971. Playing career Born in Bulwell, Nottingham, Mee played for Derby County and Mansfield Town. In 1940‚Äì41, Mee made 16 guest appearances for Southampton, scoring twice. After his playing career was cut short by injury, Mee joined the Royal Army Medical Corps where he trained as a physiotherapist and spent six years, rising to the rank of sergeant. After leaving, he worked for various football clubs as a physiotherapist before joining Arsenal in 1960, succeeding Billy Milne. Managerial career =Arsenal= After the sacking of Billy Wright in 1966, the club asked Mee to become manager, a highly surprising move, perhaps even to the man himself; Mee asked for a get-out clause for him to return to physiotherapist after twelve months if it didn't work out. Mee recruited Dave Sexton and Don Howe as his assistants, in order to make up for any tactical shortcomings of his own. Arsenal hadn't won a trophy since 1953, but, under Mee, with a crop of players from Arsenal's youth system, such as Charlie George, John Radford, Pat Rice and Ray Kennedy, began to show promise. Arsenal reached two successive League Cup finals in 1968 and 1969, but lost them both to Leeds United and Swindon Town respectively. However, the following season, the club won its first European trophy and its first trophy of any kind for 17 years, beating Anderlecht to claim the Inter- Cities Fairs Cup, 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. After being 3-0 down in the away leg, Arsenal grabbed a late consolation and then beat the Belgian side 3‚Äì0 at Highbury. The Fairs Cup was only the warm-up for the main act, namely the FA Cup and League Double win in 1971. The League title was won at White Hart Lane, home of their deadly rivals Tottenham Hotspur, on Monday 3 May, the last day of the season; five days later Arsenal beat Liverpool 2‚Äì1 at Wembley after extra-time, the winning goal scored by Charlie George. It was only the second time a club had won a Double in the twentieth century. Arsenal had ambitions to retain their title the following season and signed Alan Ball from Everton. However their league campaign faltered and their hopes of a trophy depended on the FA Cup, where Arsenal had again reached the final, this time facing Leeds. Arsenal lost by a single goal. In the 1972‚Äì73 season Arsenal managed a serious championship challenge, at one point topping the table, but eventually finished runners-up. A run in the FA Cup was brought to an end by a semi final defeat to eventual winners Sunderland. Mee then began to break up the team which had won the double, and players such as Ray Kennedy, Charlie George and captain Frank McLintock departed. Mee announced his resignation in 1976 as Arsenal's most successful manager in terms of victories with 241 wins, a number that would not be surpassed until 2006 by Ars√®ne Wenger. Mee was succeeded by Terry Neill. =Post-Arsenal= He would later join Watford as assistant to Graham Taylor in 1978 in charge of scouting, and later became a director of the Hornets before retiring in 1991. Mee was made an OBE in 1984 for services to football. He was the younger brother of fellow footballer Georgie Mee. He died in London at the age of 82, in 2001.

His Ultramontanism spearheaded the Romanisation of the Catholic Church in Ireland and ushered in the devotional revolution experienced in Ireland through the second half of the 19th century and much of the 20th century. A trained biblical theologian and scholar of ancient languages, Cullen crafted the formula for papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council. Early life Cullen was born at Prospect, Narraghmore, Athy, County Kildare, one of 16 children of Hugh and Judith Maher Cullen,John N.

His first school was the Quaker Shackleton School in nearby Ballitore. Following the relaxation of some of the Penal Laws, his father purchased some , giving him the status of a Catholic \\"strong farmer\\", a class that greatly influenced 19th-century Irish society. They were fervent in their Catholicism and fearful of the sort of social unrest that had led to the failed 1798 Rising.Bowen, Desmond. Paul Cardinal Cullen and the shaping of modern Irish Catholicism, Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, 1983 Cullen entered St. Patrick's, Carlow College, in 1816, and, in 1820, he proceeded to the Pontifical Urban College in Rome, where his name is registered on the roll of students of 29 November 1820. At the close of a distinguished course of studies, he was selected to hold a public disputation in the halls of the Propaganda on 11 September 1828, in 224 theses from all theology and ecclesiastical history. The theological tournament was privileged in many ways, for Pope Leo XII, attended by his court, presided on the occasion, while no fewer than ten cardinals assisted at it, together with all the √©lite of ecclesiastical Rome. Vincenzo Pecci, the future Pope Leo XIII, was present at the disputation.Moran, Patrick Francis Cardinal. \\"Paul Cullen.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 6 Nov. 2014 Cullen graduated a doctor of divinity. He was ordained in 1829. During his studies, Cullen acquired knowledge of classical and Oriental languages. He was later appointed to the chairs of Hebrew and Sacred Scripture in the schools of the Propaganda, and receiving at the same time the charge of the famed printing establishment of the Congregation of Propaganda Fidei. This later charge he resigned in 1832, after being appointed Rector of the Pontifical Irish College in Rome, but during the short term of his administration, he published a standard edition of the Greek and Latin Lexicon of Benjamin Hedericus, which still holds its place in the Italian colleges; he also edited the Acts of the congregation in seven quarto volumes, as well as other important works. Rector of Pontifical Irish College In late 1831, Cullen was appointed rector of a fledgling and struggling Irish College. He successfully secured the future of the college by increasing the student population and thereby strengthening the finances of the college. He astutely fostered relationships with the Irish hierarchy, on whom he relied for students, often becoming their official Roman agent. This role yielded income and influence and was to remain a key function of future rectors. He endeavoured to chart a middle ground between conflicting parties of Irish bishops. He was active in his opposition to the establishment of the secular Queen's Colleges.Review of Cardinal Cullen & his World at Pontificio Collegio Irlandese, 2 December 2011 During the revolution that marked the demise of the Papal States and the beginning of the Roman Republic, he accepted the position of rector of the College of Propaganda while retaining charge of the Irish College. As all the rectors of Colleges in Rome, who were not foreigners, had to leave the city, Cullen was left in charge, temporally, of their interests. Soon after his appointment the Revolutionary Trimuvirate issued orders that the College of Propaganda was to be dissolved and the buildings appropriated. The rector appealed to Lewis Cass, a United States Charge de Affairs at Rome, for the protection of the citizens of the United States who were students of the college. Within an hour, the American flag was floating over the Propaganda College. The order of confiscation was withdrawn. Cass was subsequently criticized for his actions by American anti-Catholic interests.Chadman, Charles E., \\"Cullen, Cardinal Paul\\", Cyclopedia of Law, Charles Erehart Armagh and Dublin Cullen was appointed Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh on 19 December 1849 and consecrated by the Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda at the Irish College in Rome on 24 February 1850. He was also named Apostolic Delegate. His first major act as Archbishop of Armagh was to convene the Synod of Thurles (1850), the first Roman Catholic national synod held in Ireland since the Reformation. It occurred during the period of the debilitating Irish Famine which reduced the population of the country by over 2 million people through starvation, disease and emigration. The purpose of the synod was to establish a new ecclesiastical discipline in Ireland. This included rules relating to the celebration of Mass, the administration of the sacraments and the maintenance of registers and archives.\\"Paul Cullen (1852‚Äì1878)\\", Archdiocese of Dublin Cullen was transferred to the See of Dublin on 1 May 1852 and 14 years later, in 1866, was elevated to the cardinalate as Cardinal-Priest of San Pietro in Montorio the first Irish cardinal. Cullen was sent to Ireland to bring the Irish church into conformity with Roman canon law and usage and to that end he recruited new clergy and orders of religious brother and sisters. After a series of disastrous harvest in the 1860s, he founded, with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Mansion House Relief Committee in 1862. Cullen also started the practice of Irish priests wearing Roman collars and being called \\"Father\\" (instead of \\"Mister\\") by their parishioners.Essay by David Kennedy The Catholic Church in Ulster since 1800, BBC publications, 1958, p. 178 Cullen was particularly intent on promoting Roman Catholic religious education in Ireland. From the first days of his episcopate Cullen had planned and pursued a Roman Catholic university for Ireland. The university project was welcomed generally by the Irish at home and abroad and the beginnings of the institution in Dublin gave some promise. In 1862 the cornerstone of the New University building was laid with Archbishop Hughes of New York preaching on the occasion. John Henry Newman, whom he had invited to be Rector of the Catholic University, complained that the Archbishop treated him and the laity not as equals but as his subjects. Cullen paid frequent visits to Rome. He took part in the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1854 and with the 18th centenary of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul in 1867, when he stayed at the Irish College. He attended all the sessions of Vatican I, taking an active part in its deliberations. Towards the close of the council, at the express wish of the Central Commission, he proposed a formula for the definition of papal infallibility. It was a matter of great delicacy, as promoters of the definition were split in various factions, some anxious to assign a wide range to the pope's decisions, and others would set forth in a somewhat indefinite way the papal prerogative. In 1864, he founded the Irish Ecclesiastical Record. He arrived late to the Conclave of 1878. Politics He was the most important Irish political figure in the 30 years between Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stuart Parnell. Miller, David W.(2013). Cardinal Paul Cullen and His World ed. by D√°ire Keogh and Albert McDonnell (review). The Catholic Historical Review, Vol.99, No.1, p.168. The Catholic University of America Press, 2013 In political matters, Cullen made it a rule to support every measure, whatever its provenance, conducive to the interests of his vision for the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. Desmond Bowen considers Cardinal Cullen \\"a cautious, suspicious, and usually shrewd product of the Roman school of diplomacy\\". He had a strong distrust of secret societies and waged a public campaign against the Young Irelanders and the Fenians. He supported redress by constitutional means. The Gladstone government disestablished the Church of Ireland during his episcopacy. Cullen was a frequent visitor at the vice-regal lodge to lobby the government. In 1867, the Fenian leader General Thomas F. Burke had been sentenced to death, and efforts to obtain a reprieve had been in vain. He had fought with distinction in the American Civil War, and the British government was determined to deter other skilled military leaders from enlisting with revolutionaries. The orders of execution from London were peremptory. The scaffold was already erected, and the next morning Burke was to be hanged. Through mediation from Archbishop Hughes of New York and others, Cullen became convinced of the character of the accused and was able to obtain a grant of reprieve for Burke. Death He died in Dublin and was buried at Holy Cross College in Drumcondra. Legacy Monument to Cardinal Cullen in Saint Mary's Pro-Cathedral, Dublin Cullen is most notable today for being the first Irish cardinal. With his experience and friendships in Rome he was able to influence the choice of appointments to episcopal sees in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada. His relatives, friends, and students, referred to as \\"Cullenites\\", exerted great influence overseas, with his nephew, Patrick Francis Moran, archbishop of Sydney, one notable example. The term also refers to a style of leadership resembling that of Cullen, characterized as \\"authoritative\\" and \\"intransigent\\". Father Thomas N. Burke, O.P., in a sermon at a solemn Requiem mass, the \\"Month's Mind\\" of 27 November 1878, said: \\"The guiding spirit animating, encouraging and directing the wonderful work of the Irish Catholic Church for the last twenty eight years was Paul, Cardinal Cullen.\\"\\"The Life and Times of Cardinal Cullen\\", The Tablet, 7 December 1878 Cullen has been credited with the revival of regular Catholic devotion in Ireland. An extreme Ultramontanist, he vigorously opposed secret societies with revolutionary aims, as well as the system of mixed education then in force. His opposition was largely responsible for the failure of Gladstone's Irish Universities Bill in 1873. J. L. Hammond, Gladstone and the Irish Nation (1938) pp 124-25. In James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, the protagonist's father mentions Cullen: \\"Mr Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn. O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another apple of God's eye!\\"James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man Although a devout Catholic herself, Mary Jane, wife of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, wrote a blistering response in her poem, \\"Tis for the Glory of the Faith\\", to what she saw as Cullen's suggestion that Irish emigrants had the role of spreading Catholicism abroad. :Who said 'twas willed our race should be :Live monuments of misery? :To spread the faith throughout the world? :Who spoke such blasphemy, and why? :Who dared the generous God belie? :And yet thy bishops-Cullen-saith, :'Tis for the glory of Thy Faith. :And yet the Lord Chief Bishop Cullen saith'' :'Tis for the glory of our holy faith!Irish Lyrical Poems, Mrs. O'Donovan Rossa, New York, 1868. pp. 18-20 See also *St. Vincent's Industrial School, Goldenbridge References Further reading * Bowen, Desmond.

Biography Egede was born in Kabelv√•g, a village in V√•gan, Norway, on the southern shore of Austv√•g√∏y. He was the older son of the village minister Hans Egede and his wife Gertrud Rask. Hans became dedicated to the cause of restoring contact with and missionizing among the Norsemen of the lost Greenland colony, who were presumed to have remained Catholic following the Reformation. He parlayed support among Norwegian merchants and the Danish Mission College into the establishment of the Bergen Greenland Company, which equipped three ships which left Bergen in 1721. A few months later, the Egede family and about forty other colonists landed on the Island of Hope (modern Kangeq) at the mouth of the fjord which houses today's Nuuk. Scurvy broke out and most returned home as quickly as possible, but the natives proved generally curious and helpful. No Norse survivors were found and Hans's company went bankrupt in 1727, but he and his family learned the local Inuit dialect and began a Christian mission among them.\\"Hans Egede.

The Lutheran mission was not as successful as the Moravian missions in Greenland, but the expansion of colonies and trading outposts under Jacob Severin's company and the General Trade Company was always eventually followed by a chapel or church at the site. Egede was also an accomplished botanist. In 1742, Egede was appointed Minister of the Vartov Lutheran Church in Copenhagen. In 1747, he became a professor of theology at the Greenland Mission Seminary established in Denmark by his father and then, in 1758, its provost. In 1779, he was elevated to Bishop of Greenland and, in 1785, made a fellow of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.Jacobs, Henry Eyster & al. The Lutheran Cyclopedia. Scribner, 1899. Egede and a kalaaleq woman named Arnarsaq translated the New Testament into Kalaallisut, the language of the West Greenland Inuit. He went on to publish a Kalaallisut-Danish-Latin dictionary (1750), a revised Kalaallisut catechism (1756), and a Kalaallisut grammar (1760), as well as a number of other books concerning the language.

London: Routledge, Kegan, Paul, 1928, p. 51. while the Armenian chronicler Matthew of Edessa, from the 12th century, notes that he was of Georgian (Vrats) origin had in mind Pakourianos' religious affiliation.On this, see Gregory himself proclaimed that he belonged to \\"the glorious people of the Iberians\\" and insisted his monks to know the Georgian language.The Byzantine Empire By Robert Browning, p. 126, The Catholic University of America Press, 1992 In her study on Byzantine administration over the provinces of Armenia, Armenian historian Viada Arutjunova-Fidanjan believes that Pakourianos was born into a Chalcedonian Armenian family.Arutjunova-Fidanjan, Viada. \\"Some Aspects of the Military- Administrative Districts and of Byzantine Administration in Armenia During the 11th Century.\\" Revue des √âtudes Arm√©niennes. N.S. 20, (1986-1987), p. 315. Taking into account all the evidence available on Pakourianos, the scholar Nina G. Garso√Øan proposed that \\"the most likely explanation is that [the Pakourian family] belonged to the mixed Armeno-Iberian Chalcedonian aristocracy, which dwelt in the border district of Tayk/Tao.\\" According to Anna Comnena, Pakourianos was tiny of body but a mighty warrior.Anna Comnena, ‚ÄúThe Alexiad‚Äù, translated by E.R.A. Sewter, London: Penguin Books, 1969, p. 81. =Byzantine service= Since 1060 Gregory served in Byzantine army. In 1064 he had achieved a significant position among the Byzantine military aristocracy, but failed at defending Ani against the Seljuk leader Alp Arslan, King Bagrat IV of Georgia and Albanian King Goridzhan in the same year. Abaza, Viktor. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ê—Ä–º–µ–Ω–∏–∏. Saint Petersburg, 1888, p. 83. Since 1071 he was appointed as a Strategos (governor) of the theme of Iberia. As the Seljuk advance forced the Byzantines to evacuate the eastern Anatolian fortresses and the theme of Iberia, Gregory ceded control over Kars and Tao to King George II of Georgia in 1074. This did not help, however, to stem the Turkish advance and the area became a battleground of the Georgian-Seljuk wars.Edwards (1988), pp. 138-140 Afterwards he served under Michael VII Doukas (1071‚Äì78) and Nikephoros III Botaneiates (1078‚Äì81) in various responsible positions on both the eastern and the western frontiers of the empire. Later Gregory was involved in a coup that removed Nikephoros III. The new Emperor, Alexios I Komnenos, appointed him \\"megas domestikos of All the West\\" and gave him many more properties in the Balkans. He possessed numerous estates in various parts of the Byzantine Empire and was afforded a variety of privileges by the emperor, including exemption from certain taxes. In 1081, he commanded the left flank against the Normans at the Battle of Dyrrachium. A year later he evicted the Normans from Moglena. He died in 1086 fighting the Pechenegs at the battle of Beliatoba, charging so vigorously he crashed into a tree. Gregory was also known as a noted patron and promoter of Christian culture. He together with his brother Abas (Apasios) made, in 1074, a significant donation to the Eastern Orthodox Holy Monastery of Iviron on Mount Athos and commissioned the regulations (typikon) for this foundation. He signed the Greek version of the Typikon in Armenian.Typikon of Gregory Pakourianos for the Monastery of the Mother of God Petritzonitissa in Bachkovo. Page 54, paragraph 71. Paul Lemerle.

Current labor law reflects the historic interrelation between the state and the Confederation of Mexican Workers, the labor confederation officially aligned with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI), which ruled Mexico under various names for more than seventy years. While the law, on its face, promises workers the right to strike and to organize, in practice it makes it difficult or impossible for independent unions to organize while condoning the corrupt practices of many existing unions and the employers with which they deal. History of Mexican labor law The current system originated in the Mexican Revolution of 1910‚Äì1920, which produced the Constitution of 1917. Article 123 of that Constitution gave workers the right to organize labor unions and to strike. It also provided protection for women and children, the eight-hour day, and a living wage. The Constitution's promised rights, however, remained mere promises until 1931, when the government enacted the Ley Federal de Trabajo or Federal Labor Law. The LFT established Juntas de Conciliaci√≥n y Arbitraje (the Boards of Conciliation and Arbitration), made up of representatives of the government, employers and labor unions. Organizing, elections and strikes In order to participate in this system, a union must have a legal registration (registro), must have an officially recognized right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements (titularidad), and must periodically re-register its officers and be accepted by the state (toma de nota). This system can be used to hobble independent unions not associated with the CTM or other federations that have established relations with the state, since all three members of these boards often have self-interested reasons for denying or delaying registration to rival unions. Employers can also avoid unionization by entering into \\"protection contracts\\" with \\"sindicatos blancos\\" or \\"white unions\\", often before a plant is ever built. Such contracts frequently give the union a closed shop, which authorizes the union to demand that the employer fire a worker who is not a member in the union in good standing; that power can, in turn, be used to single out employees who seek to organize independent unions for termination. Some observers, including the independent Uni√≥n Nacional de Trabajadores (http://www.unt.org.mx) or UNT, estimate that between eighty and ninety percent of all collective bargaining agreements in Mexico fall into this category. Employees are not always aware that they are covered by a protection contract or that they are represented by a union; while the ghost union may have registered with the Board and filed its contract with it, those records are not made public. An outside union that has filed a petition seeking to organize workers may have its petition dismissed if it is unaware that another union is already recognized or if it does not list the correct name or legal address of the incumbent union. If an outside union challenging a recognized union is able to obtain registration, then it must go through an election to oust the incumbent. Local Boards often delay such elections for long periods; when they do take place they are by voice vote, rather than secret ballot, in elections held in the workplace under the supervision of a representative of the labour board, the employer, the official union and the independent union. In recent contested elections workers have been required to pass through a gauntlet of armed representatives of the incumbent union in order to report for work and to vote in their workplace. Even if the independent union wins the election, the original contract remains in place until its expiration. While Mexican labor law gives workers powerful rights to strike, barring employers from hiring replacement workers or operating during a strike, those rights are dependent on official approval from the Board. These local Boards frequently declare strikes to be \\"inexistente\\" or non- existent, depriving striking workers of all their legal protections. As a result, while labour protests and work stoppages are frequent in Mexico, legal strikes are rare. Proposals for change The PRI and Mexican employers' associations started floating proposals to enhance productivity of Mexican industry by allowing it more \\"flexibility\\" during the late 1980s, when \\"technocrats\\" such as Miguel de la Madrid, Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo were in command of the PRI. Those proposals made no headway, however, until after the election of Vicente Fox Quesada of the Partido Acci√≥n Nacional, or PAN, in 2000. Fox's Secretary of Labor, Carlos Abascal Carranza, a former head of one of the largest employer associations, initiated discussions in 2001 with employer associations and the official and independent union confederations aimed at achieving a consensus proposal for labor law reform. The Abascal proposal presented in 2002, however, would tighten government control of unions and collective bargaining, without taking any steps to make information about unions' collective bargaining agreements or their activities available to affected workers or the public or make the organizing process any less cumbersome. On the contrary, the proposed reforms would heighten the risks for workers seeking to organize by requiring independent unions to submit the name and address of each of their members to the local Boards, which would then have the power to investigate the authenticity of their signatures. The reforms would also favor existing unions by barring the board from considering more than one election petition at a time and tightening jurisdictional rules defining which labor organization can represent which workers, according to their craft, enterprise and company, making it impossible for some independent unions to challenge incumbents. Opponents of the law have challenged it under the provisions of the labor side letter to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). While the CTM originally supported the reforms, some unions within the official labor movement have expressed reservations about it. The proposals are currently at a standstill.

The Columbia Center and other downtown skyscrapers can be seen in center background, and the upper part of Harborview Medical Center is just visible at right. Typical Yesler Terrace houses Children's playground, Yesler Terrace Yesler Terrace, a public housing development in Seattle, Washington was, at the time of its completion in 1941, Washington state's first public housing development and the first racially integrated public housing development in the United States. It occupies much of the area formerly known as Yesler Hill, Yesler's Hill, or Profanity Hill. The development is administered by the Seattle Housing Authority, who have been redeveloping the neighborhood into a mixed-income area with multi-story buildings and community amenities since 2013. Etymology The name derives ultimately from Henry Yesler, pioneer mill owner. Yesler Way was originally the skid road on which logs were skidded down to the mill. The southern part of the hill came to be known as Yesler's Hill, Yesler Hill, or Profanity Hill. These names referred roughly to the part of First Hill south of the original King County Courthouse at 8th Avenue and Terrace Street. Razed in 1931, the courthouse site was roughly the western portion of the present-day Harborview Medical Center. The name \\"Profanity Hill\\" could have its origins from the cursing of the attorneys and litigants at having to climb so steep a grade after missing the cable car, or because of the slum neighborhood known for its uncouth inhabitants to the south where Yesler Terrace is now situated. Description Yesler Terrace is located on the southernmost part of First Hill, along Yesler Way immediately east of downtown Seattle. Uphill across Interstate 5 from Pioneer Square and the International District. Much of the site included Nihonmachi or Japantown until Executive Order 9066 ordered residents to be interned. Yesler Terrace sits on with 561 residential units in 68 buildings, many of which are two-story rowhouses. Unlike most public housing developments, residents have their own private yards. Demographics As of 2005, there were 1,167 residents. An estimated 38% of households are Asian or Asian American, 40% are African or African American, 11% are White, and 3% Native American. Redevelopment Talks of redeveloping the 60-year- old Yesler Terrace, which had become the oldest public housing project in the city, began in 2004 amid similar schemes to redevelop Rainier Vista, High Point and NewHolly into mixed-income neighborhoods. Formal planning on the project began in 2006 with the hiring of a planning team and recruitment for a citizen review panel. The $1.7 billion redevelopment project of the neighborhood began in 2013, with plans to replace existing homes with 5,000 mixed-income residential units, of office space, and of retail and community space. The new development will include at least 561 units for those earning 30% of the area median income (AMI) or less as well as 290 units for 60% of AMI and 850 units for 80% of AMI.\\"Yesler Terrace.\\" Redevelopment. Seattle Housing Authority, n.d. Web. 14 Feb. 2017. . The SHA partnered with developer Vulcan Real Estate, who would buy and develop private parcels, and architects Weber Thompson. The first new building, Kebero Court, opened in May 2015 and was followed by the opening of Raven Terrace in February 2016. The project, the largest such redevelopment in Seattle's history, is anticipated to take up to 20 years for the full buildout. The First Hill Streetcar, which began operation in 2016, connects Yesler Terrace to Capitol Hill via Broadway, and the International District via Jackson Street. Prior to the start of construction, existing Yesler Terrace residents had organized to oppose any redevelopment plans that would reduce the number of units available to residents with the lowest income.

After four months in the capital city, the Holstein embassy departed again for the Baltic on Christmas Eve, 1634, and on 10 January arrived at Reval (now Tallinn) in Swedish Estonia. While the ambassadors continued to Gottorp some of the party, including Fleming, remained in Reval.Sperberg-McQueen (1990) p. 81 In the event, Fleming was there for about a year, during which he organized a poetry circle called \\"the Shepherds\\".Elena Rannu, The living past of Tallinn (1993), p. 106: \\"It happened that the German poet Paul Fleming (1609‚Äì1640), a doctor by profession, was one of that Holstein Embassy too.

Located in the Elk Mountains, within the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness of the White River National Forest, it lies along the border between the Pitkin and Gunnison counties, west of Aspen and southwest of the town of Snowmass Village. Snowmass Mountain is named for the large snowfield that lies on its eastern slopes. Snowmass Mountain should not be confused with the Snowmass ski area, located outside Snowmass Village; nor with nearby Snowmass Peak, a lower but more visually striking peak that towers over Snowmass Lake. Hagerman Peak sits between Snowmass Mountain and Snowmass Peak and is also often mistaken for Snowmass Mountain. Hiking/climbing The route most commonly used to climb Snowmass Mountain is the Snowmass Creek approach. The route to the summit starts at Snowmass Lake, which is itself an hike up Snowmass Creek from the parking area. Most people hike to the lake, camp the night and then proceed to the top. This route is recommended in the spring and early summer when the snowfield still covers much of the route; however an ice axe and crampons are recommended for travel on the snowfield. Later in the summer there is more travel on talus (scree) and more danger from rockfall. An alternative in snow-free conditions is to hike up to the saddle between the peak and Hagerman Peak. From that point there are climbers' trails which proceed on the opposite (west) side of the ridge to the summit. A different and much less used route climbs the west side of Snowmass Mountain from Geneva Lake, which is accessed from the North Fork of the Crystal River.

A Parisian dandy, watercolour by Gavarni. Paul Gavarni was the nom de plume of Sulpice Guillaume Chevalier (13 January 1804 ‚Äì 24 November 1866), a French illustrator, born in Paris. Early career Gavarni's father, Sulpice Chevalier, was from a family line of coopers from Burgundy. Paul began work as a mechanical worker in a machine factory but he saw that to make any progress in his profession, he had to be able to draw; accordingly in his spare time in the evenings, he took classes in drawing. He devoted his special attention to architectural and mechanical drawing and worked at land surveying and mapping which led to his obtaining a position with the Government Ordnance Department as a draughtsman.Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, Vol. 20 (1885) pp. 615‚Äì619, Frank Leslie's Publishing House, New York It wasn't until his early thirties that he turned his attention to his proper vocation as an artist. Nom-de- plume The story is told that he took his name from Gavarnie in Luz-Saint- Sauveur where he had taken a journey into the Pyrenees. His first published drawings were for the magazine Journal des modes.Paul Gavarni, Gino Doria (1856) Douze nouveaux travestissements par Gavarni, Bureau du Journal des modes parisiennes, Paris At the time, Gavarni was barely thirty years of age. His sharp and witty drawings gave these generally commonplace and unartistic figures a life-likeness and an expression which soon won him a name in fashionable circles. He gradually gave greater attention to this more congenial work, and ultimately stopped working as an engineer to become the director of the journal Les Gens du monde. Gavarni followed his interests, and began a series of lithographed sketches in which he portrayed the most striking characteristics, foibles and vices of the various classes of French society. The letterpress explanations attached to his drawings were short, but were forcible and humorous, if sometimes trivial, and were adapted to the particular subjects. At first he confined himself to the study of Parisian manners, more especially those of the Parisian youth. Publications Most of his best work appeared in Le Charivari. He had been invited by the editor Fran√ßois Caboche to draw for the magazine. Gavarni had never drawn caricatures and was reluctant to accept the request but was persuaded to submit some drawings for approval. This he did and they were accepted but he didn't care for the captions which had been added by the magazine editors. Thereafter, he started writing his own. This was the beginning of the Boites aux lettres series. Some of his most scathing and most earnest pictures, the fruit of a visit to London, appeared in L'Illustration.L'Illustration Vol.19 (Jan‚ÄìJun 1852) He also illustrated Honor√© de Balzac's novels, and Eug√®ne Sue's Wandering Jew. Illustrated works Among his illustrated works were Les Lorettes, Les Actrices, Les Coulisses, Les Fasizionables, Les Gentilshommes bourgeois, Les Artistes, Les D√©bardeurs, Clichy, Les √âtudiants de Paris, Les Baliverneries parisiennes, Les Plaisirs champ√™tres, Les Bals masqu√©s, Le Carnaval, Les Souvenirs du carnaval, Les Souvenirs du bal Chicard, La Vie des jeunes hommes, and Les Patois de Paris. He had now ceased to be director of Les Gens du monde; but he was engaged as ordinary caricaturist of Le Charivari, and, while making the fortune of the paper, he made his own. His name was exceedingly popular, and his illustrations for books were eagerly sought for by publishers. Le Juif errant, by Eugene Sue (1843, 4 vols. 8vo), the French translation of Hoffman's tales (1843, 8 vo), the first collective edition of Balzac's works (Paris, Houssiaux, 1850, 20 vols. 8 vo), Le Diable √† Paris (1844‚Äì1846, 2 vols. 4 vo),Le Diable √† Paris (1853) Marescq et Compagnie, Paris Les Fran√ßais peints par eux-m√™mes (1840‚Äì1843, 9 vols. 8vo), Les Fran√ßais peints par eux-m√™mes Vol. 1‚Äì2 (1861)Les Fran√ßais peints par eux-m√™mes Vol. 3 (1841)Les Fran√ßais peints par eux-m√™mes Vol. 4 (1850) the collection of Physiologies published by Aubert in 38 vols. 18mo (1840‚Äì1842),√âtienne de Neufville (1841) Physiologie des amoureux, Aubert et Cie., Paris all owed a great part of their success at the time, and are still sought for, on account of the clever and telling sketches contributed by Gavarni. Change in focus A single frontispiece or vignette was sometimes enough to secure the sale of a new book. Always desiring to enlarge the field of his observations, Gavarni soon abandoned his once favorite topics. He no longer limited himself to such types as the lorette and the Parisian student, or to the description of the noisy and popular pleasures of the capital, but turned his mirror to the grotesque sides of family life and of humanity at large. Les Enfants terribles,Les Enfants terribles sc√®nes de Gavarni (1857) Les Parents terribles,Masques et visages Gavarni (1857) Les Fourberies des femmes,Oeuvres choisies (1864) Bureaux de Figaro, Paris La Politique des femmes, Les Mans vengs, Les Nuances du sentiment, Les Rives, Les Petits Jeux de soci√©t√©, Les Fetus Malheurs du bonheur, Les Impressions de m√©nage, Les Interjections, Les Traductions en langue vulgaire,Oeuvres choisies de Gavarni (1846) Les Propos de Thomas Vireloque, etc., were composed at this time, and are his most elevated productions. But while showing the same power of irony as his former works, enhanced by a deeper insight into human nature, they generally bear the stamp of a bitter and even sometimes gloomy philosophy. At one point Gavarni was imprisoned for debt in the debtors' prison of Clichy. After his release, he published his experiences in a work called L'Argent (\\"Money\\").MacMillan's Magazine, Vol. 77 (1898) Visit to England Portrait of Paul Gavarni, a year before his death, by his son Pierre Gavarni visited England in 1849. On his return his impressions were published in the book Londres et les Anglais, illustr√©s par Gavarni (1862) by √âmile de la B√©dolli√®re.Londres et les Anglais (1862) Gustav Barba, Paris Most of these last compositions appeared in the weekly paper L'Illustration. In 1857 he published in one volume the series entitled Masques et visages (1 vol. 12 mo),Masques et visages (1857) Paulin et Lechevalier, Paris and in 1869, about two years after his death, his last artistic work, Les Douze Mois (1 vol. fol.), was given to the world. Gavarni was much engaged, during the last period of his life, in scientific pursuits, and this fact must perhaps be connected with the great change which then took place in his manner as an artist. He sent several communications to the Acad√©mie des Sciences, and until his death on 23 November 1866 he was eagerly interested in the question of aerial navigation. It is said that he made experiments on a large scale with a view to find the means of directing balloons; but it seems that he was not so successful in this line as his fellow artist, the caricaturist and photographer, Nadar. Collections and catalogues Gavarni's ≈íuvres choisies was published in 1845, followed in 1850 by two volumes named Perles et Parures. Some essays in prose and in verse written by him were collected by one of his biographers, Charles Yriarte, and published in 1869.

There's plenty of misleading information about the publishing year of the game and the sequel. According to KosolaTurboraketti review at Retropelit he created the beta version of Turboraketti in 1992 and the final version in 1993. Some people have thought that the final version is the sequel but Kosola says that there has never been Turboraketti II. Turboraketti is played by two people fighting each other with spaceships. The game is similar to an earlier game called Gravity Force. The ships are viewed from a side perspective and gravity pulls ships down. The screen is split in two halves in vertical direction. Both players have one half of the screen. Hitting a landscape or another ship destroys the vessel. Movement of ships is affected by their thrust, gravity and drag in air and liquid. The players can choose from various weapons that are advantageous in different situations. Rapid fire weapons are good for causing at least some damage for the opponent and non-rapid fire weapons are good for hitting the opponent hard from proximity. The players can load weapons and fuel on their base platforms. The base platform can also repair a ship. The player needs to make a trade-off between good acceleration (small mass) and the amount of ordnance and fuel loaded. It is also possible to play the game as a time race.

It is part of the larger town of Ashton-in-Makerfield and is geographically indistinguishable from it, but forms a separate local council ward. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 11,662. Served by Bryn railway station, Bryn is home to the Three Sisters Recreation Area which has been created from three large spoil tips which remain from Bryn's role in Lancashire's coal mining past. The recreation area is also the site of the Three Sisters Race Circuit, which provides race driving instruction and plays host to kart racing events and motorcycle road race meetings at clubman level.  Etymology  The name Bryn is most likely derived from Cumbric br√Ønn, meaning 'hill' (compare with modern ). Alternatively, the name may be derived directly from the Welsh equivalent, possibly reflecting Welsh settlement in the 12th century. A third explanation is that the name is derived from Old English bryne, 'burning, fire', suggestive of land cleared by burning.  History  The former Bryn (or Brynne) Hall was the seat of the Gerard family beginning in the thirteenth century or earlier. It was a \\"safe house\\" for the English Roman Catholic martyr and saint Edmund Arrowsmith and his hand was reportedly preserved there after his execution. The house, dating to the fourteenth century, has now completely collapsed and remaining stones have been cleared.. The Roman Catholic parish of Our Lady of Good Counsel was founded in 1896. In 1902 the foundation stone of the church, dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, was laid by Bishop Thomas Whiteside, the 4th Bishop of Liverpool. The church, on Downall Green Road, was designed in the style popularised by Augustus Pugin and opened on 21 October 1903. On 8 September 1955 the church was consecrated and the holy relics of two early Roman martyrs ‚Äì Saints Speciosi and Fructuosi, were placed under the altar stone. In the course of over 100 years, the church has been served by 13 priests, the current parish priest being Father John Gorman. The Unitarian Park Lane Chapel in Wigan Road was built in 1697, though its congregation was founded in 1662. It is the oldest Non-conformist chapel and congregation in the whole district. By the nineteenth century Park Lane was only one of nine non-conformist chapels in the heavily recusant area.

With the completion of Boulevard des Allumetti√®res, Route 148 was rerouted onto the southern leg of Autoroute 50 and then west towards Aylmer on Boulevard des Allumetti√®res. Until October 2014 there had been two segments of A-5 for several years: # The main segment was a freeway that continued for from the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge through the Hull sector of Gatineau to a short access road to Route 105 south of Wakefield. # The second segment, built in 1993, was a short four- lane, at-grade expressway bypass of Wakefield, which overlapped Route 105 and Route 366. The MTQ plan to eliminate the discontinuity between the two segments was completed in October 2014. Further extensions of A-5 north of Wakefield have been deemed unnecessary given the current AADT on Route 105. A extension of the southern segment past Tulip Valley, an area of Route 105 that has been the site of multiple fatal incidents in the past, was opened on 4 December 2009 following a $27 million () extension project. Prolongement de l'autoroute 5 en Outaouais Another $115 million project began in 2010 to connect the south and north segments, completing the carriageway to Wakefield in October 2014. Beginning in June 2008, the MTQ began replacing the concrete surface from Ottawa to Saint-Joseph Boulevard with asphalt after multiple incidents in which pieces of concrete broke out from the surface including one that struck the windshield of a vehicle, killing its driver in November 2007. Construction was completed by the end of 2008. Autoroute 5 is the only Quebec A-class Autoroute to have only 1 digit in its name.

Old Mother Riley (full comedy name: Daphne Bluebell Snowdrop Riley) is an Irish washerwoman and charwoman character, devised by Lucan (born Arthur Towle). His wife Kitty McShane played Old Mother Riley's daughter, Kitty. It was essentially a drag act but also a double act. The couple played music halls, theatres, and broadcast on radio and appeared in films. Lucan was voted sixth biggest British box-office star by the Motion Picture Herald in 1943.http://www.brent.gov.uk/media/7031206/Arthur%20Lucan%20-%20the%20man%20who%20was%20Old%20Mother%20Riley.pdf In 1939, Jimmy Clitheroe appeared in an Old Mother Riley pantomime called The Old Woman who Lives in a Shoe, and then the following year had a part in the film, Old Mother Riley in Society. The Film Fun comic included an ‚ÄúOld Mother Riley‚Äù strip cartoon in the 1940s. Old Mother Riley was the first and arguably the most influential drag act on stage and screen. Although nothing like the glamorous acts like Danny La Rue, Old Mother Riley proved that drag could be a smash hit with audiences and make you a star. The Old Mother Riley films also proved that drag could be an acceptable part of comedy and storytelling. Previous to Old Mother Riley, drag was a mixture of singing acts and short comedy sketches in music halls across the UK. Roy Rolland was Lucan's understudy and stand-in, and after Lucan's death in 1954 he continued to play the Old Mother Riley character in pantomime, on television and in cabaret until the 1980s. The character and show exist in a comic lineage that extends to Mrs. Brown's Boys. Old Mother Riley films Made on a minuscule budget, but extremely profitable, 16 of the 18 films made by Arthur Lucan featured him as Old Mother Riley: * Stars on Parade (1936) * Bridget's Night Out (1936) * Kathleen Mavourneen (1937) * Old Mother Riley (1937) * Old Mother Riley in Paris (1938) * Old Mother Riley, MP (1939) * Old Mother Riley Joins Up (1940) * Old Mother Riley in Society (1940) * Old Mother Riley in Business (1941) * Old Mother Riley's Circus (1941) * Old Mother Riley's Ghosts (1941) * Old Mother Riley Overseas (1943) * Old Mother Riley Detective (1943) * Old Mother Riley at Home (1945) * Old Mother Riley's New Venture (1949) * Old Mother Riley Headmistress (1950) * Old Mother Riley's Jungle Treasure (1951) * Mother Riley Meets the Vampire (1952) ‚Äì co-stars Bela Lugosi.

It was a non-partisan, non-profit organization, but critics said it was a \\"corporate-funded campaigning group\\". IPN ran campaigns on issues such as trade, development, healthcare and the environment. IPN‚Äôs campaigns were pro-free market. Vision According to its website, \\"IPN aims to empower individuals and promote respect for people and property in order to eliminate poverty, improve human health and protect the environment. IPN promotes public awareness of the importance of this vision for all people, both rich and poor. \\"IPN seeks to achieve its vision by promoting the role of market institutions in certain key international policy debates: sustainable development, health, and globalisation and trade. IPN works with academics, think tanks, journalists and policymakers on every continent.\\" History IPN was founded as a UK charity by Sir Antony Fisher in 1971. The mission of this body is to \\"Promote the advancement of learning by research into economic and political science and the publication of such research\\". The charity‚Äôs original name was The International Institute for Economic Research, and now is The Atlas Economic Research Foundation (UK), but operates under the name International Policy Network. IPN‚Äôs sister organization, International Policy Network US Inc., is a non-profit started in 2001. Funding IPN is funded entirely by voluntary, charitable gifts from foundations, individuals and businesses. IPN does not receive any funding from governments or political parties, and it does no contract work. IPN develops and implements a research and advocacy agenda that encompasses not one or a few, but many public policy issues. IPN has received grants totaling hundreds of thousands of pounds from the multinational energy company ExxonMobil, \\\\- although it has not received money from the energy sector for some years. Programs IPN undertakes ongoing work on public policy in the areas of health, environment, economic development, trade, creativity and innovation. The Freedom to Trade Campaign is run in collaboration with the Atlas Global Initiative. The campaign joins 73 think tanks in 48 countries to support free trade and oppose protectionism.

Life He was born at Montpellier, educated at Narbonne and Toulouse, and began the study of medicine at Montpellier in 1750, taking his doctor's degree in 1753. In 1756, he obtained the appointment of physician to the military hospital in Normandy attached to the army of observation commanded by Marshal d'Estr√©es, but a severe attack of hospital fever compelled him to leave this post. In 1757, his services were required in the medical staff of the army of Westphalia, where he had the rank of consulting physician, and on his return to Paris he acted as joint editor of the Journal des savants and the Encyclop√©die m√©thodique. In 1759 he obtained a medical professorship at Montpellier, and in 1774 he was created joint chancellor of the university. In 1778, he published his most famous work, Nouveaux √©l√©mens de la science de l'homme, in which he employs the expression \\"vital principle\\" as a convenient term for the cause of the phenomena of life, without committing himself to either a spiritualistic or a materialistic view of its nature. Taking the degree of doctor of civil law in 1780, he secured the appointment of counsellor to the Supreme Court of Aids at Montpellier, but he soon took up his residence in Paris, having been nominated consulting physician to the king. In 1784, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Paul Joseph Barthez was called upon to edit or contribute several entries in the Encyclop√©die of Denis Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert.Frank A.

Recherches sur Diderot et sur l‚ÄôEncyclop√©die Ann√©e 1989 Volume 7 Num√©ro 7 p. 129 On the outbreak of the French Revolution he lost much of his fortune, but was much esteemed and honoured by Napoleon. He retired to Carcassonne, where he devoted himself to the study of theoretical medicine. It was from this retreat that he gave to the world his Nouvelle m√©canique des mouvemens de l'homme et des animaux, which appeared in 1798. In 1802 he published his Traitement des maladies goutteuses, and he afterwards occupied himself in preparing for the press a new edition of his √âl√©mens de la science de l'homme, of which he just lived to see the publication. His health had been declining for some years before his death, which took place soon after his removal to Paris. He bequeathed his books and manuscripts to J. Lordat, who published two volumes of his Consultations de m√©decine in 1810. His Trait√© du beau was also published posthumously in 1807.

The House of Dadiani  The first data about the family dates back to 1046. Presumably, the Dadiani descended from a certain Dadi, of the House of Vardanisdze. Appointed as hereditary eristavi (dukes) of Odishi (Samegrelo) in reward for their military services, the family had become the most powerful feudal house in western Georgia by the 1280s. At that time, the branches of the family governed also Svaneti, Guria, and Bedia. In 1542, Duke Levan I Dadiani became hereditary Prince (mtavari) of Mingrelia and established himself as an independent ruler. His descendant Prince Levan III Dadiani was forced to abdicate in 1691 and Dadiani‚Äôs relatives from the Chikovani (·É©·Éò·É•·Éù·Éï·Éê·Éú·Éò) family, hitherto Princes of Salipartiano, inherited the title of Princes of Mingrelia and the surname of Dadiani. Accepting Russian sovereignty in 1802, the Dadiani were elevated to the dignity of Prince of the Russian Empire () and enjoyed significant independence in their home affairs. Russia made a de facto annexation of Samegrelo in 1857, but Samegrelo remained nominally in existence until January 4, 1867, when Niko Dadiani, the last Prince of Samegrelo, was deposed and the principality was abolished.

It is considered to be the standard reference work in the field of Islamic studies. The first edition was published in 1913‚Äì1938, the second in 1954‚Äì2005, and the third was begun in 2007.  Content  According to Brill, the EI includes \\"articles on distinguished Muslims of every age and land, on tribes and dynasties, on the crafts and sciences, on political and religious institutions, on the geography, ethnography, flora and fauna of the various countries and on the history, topography and monuments of the major towns and cities. In its geographical and historical scope it encompasses the old Arabo- Islamic empire, the Islamic countries of Iran, Central Asia, the Indian sub- continent and Indonesia, the Ottoman Empire and all other Islamic countries\\".  Standing  EI is considered to be the standard reference work in the field of Islamic studies. Each article was written by a recognized specialist on the relevant topic. However, unsurprisingly for a work spanning 40 years until completion, not every one of them reflects recent research. This reference work is of fundamental importance on topics dealing with the geography, ethnography and biography of Muslim peoples.Elton L. Daniel, \\"Encyclopedia of Islam\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica  Editions  The first edition (EI1) was modeled on the Pauly-Wissowa Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. EI1 was created under the aegis of the International Union of Academies, and coordinated by Leiden University. It was published by Brill in four volumes plus supplement from 1913 to 1938 in English, German, and French editions. An abridged version was published in 1953 as the Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam (SEI), covering mainly law and religion. Excerpts of the SEI have been translated and published in Turkish, Arabic, and Urdu. The second edition of Encyclopaedia of Islam (EI2) was begun in 1954 and completed in 2005 (several indexes to be published until 2007); it is published by the Dutch academic publisher Brill and is available in English and French. Since 1999, (EI2) has been available in electronic form, in both CD-ROM and web-accessible versions. Besides a great expansion in content, the second edition of EI differs from the first mainly in incorporating the work of scholars of Muslim and Middle Eastern background among its many hundreds of contributors: Publication of the Third Edition of EI (EI3) started in 2007. It is available online, printed \\"Parts\\" appearing four times per year. The editorial team consists of twenty 'Sectional Editors' and five 'Executive Editors' (i.e. editors-in-chief). The Executive Editors are Kate Fleet, Gudrun Kr√§mer (Free University, Berlin), Everett Rowson (New York University), John Nawas (Catholic University of Leuven), and Denis Matringe (EHESS, CNRS). The scope of EI3 includes comprehensive coverage of Islam in the twentieth century; expansion of geographical focus to include all areas where Islam has been or is a prominent or dominant aspect of society; attention to Muslim minorities all over the world; and full attention to social science as well as humanistic perspectives.

It was started in the 1950s at University of the Punjab, as a project led by Muhammad Shafi. The editorial board worked on translating the Leiden Encyclopaedia into Urdu, amending, correcting, and adding to the Leiden text themselves. The original plan for publication, as laid out by Shafi and others, was for the Encyclopaedia (which was to be entitled Urdu Da‚Äôira Ma‚Äôarif-i-Islamiya) to span between 20 and 22 volumes, with roughly a hundred illustrations per volume, published at a rate of four volumes per year. At the time of Shafi's death in 1963, one volume of the encyclopaedia had been published (in February 1954), and a second volume was in press. Because of Shafi's death, and lack of funding, work on the Encyclopaedia stalled until 1971, when a grant from the Asia Foundation enabled it to resume. Volumes 10 and 12 were completed by 1973. By 1985, 21 out of a planned 25 volumes had been published.

She campaigned for women's suffrage, the right of women to better education, the end of coverture in British law, the abolition of child prostitution, and an end to human trafficking of young women and children into European prostitution. Grey grew up in a well-to-do and politically connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a banister. The death was a turning point for Butler, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases‚Äîparticularly in the British Army and Royal Navy‚Äîthrough the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Butler also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent. While investigating the effect of the Acts, Butler had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian ', and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Butler fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for ¬£5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj. Butler wrote more than 90 books and pamphlets over the course of her career, most of which were in support of her campaigning, although she also produced biographies of her father, her husband and Catherine of Siena. Butler's Christian feminism is celebrated by the Church of England with a Lesser Festival, and by representations of her in the stained glass windows of Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral and St Olave's Church in the City of London. Her name appears on the Reformers Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery, London, and Durham University named one of their colleges after her. Her campaign strategies changed the way feminist and suffragists conducted future struggles, and her work brought into the political milieu groups of people that had never been active before. After her death in 1906 the feminist leader Millicent Fawcett hailed her as \\"the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century\\". Biography =Early life; 1828‚Äì1850= John Grey, Butler's father, portrait by George Patten Josephine Grey was born on 13 April 1828 at Milfield, Northumberland. She was the fourth daughter and seventh child of Hannah (' Annett) and John Grey, a land agent and agricultural expert, who was a cousin of the reformist British Prime Minister, Lord Grey. In 1833 John was appointed manager of the Greenwich Hospital Estates in Dilston, near Corbridge, Northumberland, and the family moved to the area, where John acted as Lord Grey's chief political agent in Northumberland. In this role John promoted his cousin's political opinions locally, including support for Catholic emancipation, the abolition of slavery, the repeal of the Corn Laws and reform of the poor laws. Josephine was taught at home before completing her schooling at a boarding school in Newcastle upon Tyne which she attended for two years. John treated his children equally within the home. He educated them in politics and social issues and exposed them to various politically important visitors. John's political work and ideology had a strong influence on his daughter, as did the religious teaching she received from her mother; the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong social conscience and a staunch religious faith. At about the age of 17 Grey went through a religious crisis, which probably stemmed from an incident in which she discovered the body of a suicide while out riding. She became disenchanted with her weekly church attendance, describing the local vicar as \\"an honest man in the pulpit ... [who] taught us loyally all that he probably himself knew about God, but whose words did not even touch the fringe of my soul's deep discontent\\". Following her crisis, Grey did not identify with any single strand of Christianity, and remained critical of the Anglican church. She later wrote that she \\"imbibed from childhood the widest ideas of vital Christianity, only it was Christianity. I have not much sympathy with the Church. She began to speak directly to God in her prayers: In mid-1847 Grey visited her brother in County Laois, Ireland. It was at the height of the Great Famine and the first time she had come into contact with widespread suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences and later recalled that \\"As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around me, yet it printed itself upon my brain and memory.\\" =Early married life; 1850‚Äì1864= George Butler, Josephine's husband By 1850 Grey had grown close to George Butler, a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, whom she had met at several of the balls hosted around County Durham. By October that year George was sending her self-penned poems; the couple were engaged in January 1851 and married in January 1852. The Butlers set up home at 124, High Street, Oxford. George was a scholar and cleric and shared with his wife a commitment to liberal reforms and a love of Italian culture. The couple also both had a strong Christian belief and Josephine Butler later wrote of her husband that they often \\"prayed together that a holy revolution might come about and that the Kingdom of God might be established on the earth\\". In November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, followed by a second, Arthur Stanley‚Äîknown as Stanley‚Äîin May 1854. Butler's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and misogynist community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as \\"the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university\\". Butler was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Ruth in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Butler saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a \\"moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man\\"; she decided not to voice her feelings on the point but \\"to speak little with men, but much with God\\". As a more practical measure she‚Äîand George‚Äîbegan to help many of the fallen woman of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case in which they were involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at Newgate Prison. She had been seduced by a university don who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house at the end of her sentence. Alexander Munro In 1856 Butler's health began to suffer from Oxford's damp atmosphere, which exacerbated a long-standing lesion on her lung; her doctor informed her that to remain in Oxford could be fatal. As an immediate step George purchased a house in Clifton, near Bristol, where their third son, Charles, was born in 1857. The same year, as a longer-term measure, George took the position of vice-principal at Cheltenham College and they moved to a local house. They continued their support for liberal causes, including that of the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi, although their sympathy for the Union side in the American Civil War led to social ostracism; Butler considered that the resultant feeling of social isolation \\"was often painful ... but the discipline was useful\\". In May 1859 Butler gave birth to her final child, a daughter, Evangeline Mary, known as Eva. In August 1864 Eva fell from the top-floor banister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. Butler was distraught at the loss and had disturbed sleep for several years; she was unable to write about the circumstances until 30 years later. The subsequent inquest gave a verdict of accidental death. In October 1864 Stanley contracted diphtheria while Butler was still grieving for Eva. She was suffering from depression and was in poor health. After the worst of Stanley's ailment passed, Butler decided to take him to Naples for them both to rest and recuperate. The ship in which they travelled down the west coast of Italy faced rough weather, and Butler had a physical breakdown on board from which she nearly died. =Liverpool and the start of reform work; 1866‚Äì1869= In January 1866 George was appointed headmaster of Liverpool College, and the family moved to premises in the Dingle area. Despite the new surroundings, Butler continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she \\"became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself. ... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool.\\" She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars‚Äîmany of whom were prisoners‚Äîand pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them. Butler's hostel for women, Liverpool in a derelict condition in 2009 before its demolition Just as they had done in Cheltenham, the Butlers began providing shelter in their own home for some of the women, often prostitutes in the terminal stages of venereal disease. It soon became clear that there were more women in need than they could provide for, so Butler set up a hostel, with funds from local men of means. By Easter 1867 she had established a second, larger home, in which more appropriate work was provided, such as sewing and the manufacture of envelopes; the \\"Industrial Home\\", as she called it, was funded by the workhouse committee and local merchants. Butler campaigned for women's rights, including the right to the vote and to have a better education. In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the Reform Bill to widen the franchise to include women. The petition, which was supported by the MP and philosopher John Stuart Mill, was ignored and the bill became law. Butler considered the Liverpool hostels a stop-gap; women would continue to struggle to find employment until they had been better educated. In 1867, with the suffragist Anne Clough, she established the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women, which aimed to raise the status of governesses and female teachers to that of a profession; She served as its president until 1873. A series of lectures, initially in towns in the north of England, began under James Stuart, a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Although it was thought thirty students would sign up, three hundred joined. In 1868 Butler published \\"The Education and Employment of Women\\", her first pamphlet, in which she argued for access to higher education for women, and more equal access to a wider range of jobs. It was the first of 90 books and pamphlets she wrote. That May she petitioned the senate of the University of Cambridge to provide examinations for women; the Cambridge Higher Examination for women was introduced the following year. Jordan notes that \\"much of the credit for this should go to Anne Clough, but ... Butler played a very influential part ... of the campaign.\\" At the time British law relating to marriage was based on the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Butler and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Butler remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882. =First attempt to repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; 1869‚Äì1874= Butler in 1876 In 1869 Butler became aware of the Contagious Diseases Acts. They had been introduced in 1864, 1866 and 1869 to regulate prostitution in an attempt to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. The Acts authorised the police to detain women in specific areas considered to be prostitutes‚Äîno evidence was needed, other than the police officer's word. If a magistrate agreed, women were given genital examinations. If women were suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, they were held in a lock hospital until the condition was cured. If they refused to be examined or hospitalised they could be imprisoned, often with hard labour. Units of plain-clothed policemen specialised in arresting suspected prostitutes; according to Jordan, the officers were \\"hated for their surveillance and harassment of prostitutes and working-class women ... who they treated with little regard for their legal rights\\". Women who were subjected to the examination found their names and reputations affected and, according to the historian Hilary Cashman, \\"the Acts had the effect of turning them to prostitution by barring respectable ways of life to them\\". In September 1869 Wolstenholme met Butler in Bristol to discuss what could be done about the Acts. The National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was founded that October, but excluded women from its membership. In response, Wolstenholme and Butler formed the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts (LNA) before the end of the year. The organisation published a Ladies Manifesto, which stated that the Acts were discriminatory on grounds of both sex and class; the Acts, it was claimed: On 31 December 1869 the Ladies National Association published a statement in The Daily News that it had \\"been formed for the purposes of obtaining the repeal of these obnoxious Acts\\". Among the 124 signatories were the social theorist Harriet Martineau and the social reformer Florence Nightingale. Butler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting. The Home Secretary, Henry Bruce, who set up a Royal Commission in 1871 to examine the Contagious Diseases Acts At the 1870 Colchester parliamentary by-election the LNA fielded a candidate against the Liberal Party candidate Sir Henry Storks, a supporter of the Acts, who had implemented a similar regime when he commanded the British army in Malta. Butler held several local meetings during the campaign; during one, she was chased by a group of brothel owners. The presence of the LNA candidate split the Liberal vote and allowed the Conservative Party candidate to win the seat; Butler considered that \\"it proved to be somewhat of a turning-point in the history of our crusade\\". Because of Stork's loss at the by-election the Home Secretary, Henry Bruce, announced a Royal Commission to examine the situation. One MP told Butler that The commission began work in early January 1871 and spent six months taking evidence. After Butler testified on 18 March, a member of the committee, Liberal MP Peter Rylands, stated: \\"I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give you an idea of the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there\\". Nevertheless, the commission's report defended the one-sided nature of the legislation, saying \\"... there is no comparison to be made between prostitutes and the men who consort with them. With the one sex the offence is committed as a matter of gain; with the other it is an irregular indulgence of a natural impulse.\\" The report accepted the findings that the sexual health of men in the 18 areas covered by the Acts had improved. In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of \\"steel rape\\", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the age of consent should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months. In February 1872 Bruce proposed a bill that took some of the commission's recommendations, but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to the whole of the UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses and try and change others, Butler rejected it in its entirety and published The New Era, a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; the pamphlet was re- published in serial form in The Shield. It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn. Handbill issued prior to a talk during the 1872 Pontefract by-election Two months after the withdrawal of Bruce's bill, a ministerial by-election in Pontefract in 1872 gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Butler attended meetings in the town. At one LNA meeting the floor of the room had been liberally sprinkled with cayenne pepper by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; two members of the Metropolitan Police‚Äîspecially drafted into the town for the by- election‚Äîlooked on but took no action. Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, Hugh Childers, was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000). In December 1872 Butler met the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill. =European pressure and the white slave trade; 1874‚Äì1880= James Stansfeld, the first general secretary of the International Abolitionist Federation, caricature by Carlo Pellegrini in Vanity Fair The fall of the Liberal government in 1874, and its replacement with Benjamin Disraeli's Conservative administration meant that the repeal campaign stalled; Butler called it a \\"year of discouragement\\" when there was \\"deep depression in the work\\". Although the LNA kept up the pressure, progress in persuading Liberal MPs to oppose the Contagious Diseases Acts was slow, and the government was implacable in its support of the measures. At a meeting of regional LNA branches in May, one speech focused on legislation in Europe; the meeting resolved to correspond with sister organisations on the continent. At the start of December 1874 Butler left for Paris and a tour that covered France, Italy and Switzerland, where she met with local pressure groups and civic authorities. She encountered strong support from feminist groups, but hostility from the authorities. She returned from her travels at the end of February 1875. As a result of her experiences, in March 1875 Butler formed the British and Continental Federation for the Abolition of Prostitution (later renamed the International Abolitionist Federation), an organisation that campaigned against state regulation of prostitution and for \\"the abolition of female slavery and the elevation of public morality among men\\". The Liberal MP James Stansfeld‚Äîwho wished to repeal the Acts‚Äîbecame the federation's first general secretary; Butler and her friend, the Liberal MP Henry Wilson, became joint secretaries. In 1878 Josephine wrote a biography of Catherine of Siena, which Glen Petrie‚Äîher biographer‚Äîthought was probably her best work; Walkowitz considers the work provided a \\"historical justification for her own political activism\\". Another biographer, Helen Mathers, believes that \\"in emphasising that she and Catherine were born to be leaders, of both men and women, ... [Butler] made a profound contribution to feminism\\". Butler became aware of the slave trade of young women and children from England to mainland Europe in 1879. Young girls were considered \\"fair game\\", according to Mathers, as the law allowed them to become prostitutes at the age of 13. After playing a minor role in starting an investigation into an accusation of trafficking, Butler became active in the campaign in May 1880, and wrote to The Shield that \\"the official houses of prostitution in Brussels are crowded with English minor girls\\", and that in one house \\"there are immured little children, English girls of from twelve to fifteen years of age ... stolen, kidnapped, betrayed, got from English country villages by every artifice and sold to these human shambles\\". She visited Brussels where she met the mayor and local councillors and made allegations against the head of the Belgian ' and his deputy as to their involvement in the trade. After the meeting she was contacted by a detective who confirmed that the senior members of the ' were guilty of collusion with brothel keepers. She returned home and filed a deposition containing a copy of the statement from the detective and sent them to the ' (Chief Prosecutor) and the British Home Secretary. Following an investigation in Belgium, the head of the ' was removed from office, and his deputy was put on trial alongside 12 brothel owners; all were imprisoned for their roles in the trade. =Second attempt to repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; 1880‚Äì1885= William Gladstone, a friend of the Butlers, and a tacit supporter of Butler's work The 1880 general election had removed Disraeli's Conservative party from office; they were replaced by Gladstone's second ministry containing a high proportion of MPs who wanted to repeal the Acts. As Prime Minister, Gladstone had the power to nominate candidates to vacant positions within the Church and, in June 1882, he offered George Butler the position of canon of Winchester Cathedral. George had been considering retirement, but he and Josephine were concerned about their finances, as much of their income had been spent on the LNA and other causes Josephine supported. George accepted the appointment, and they moved into a grace and favour home near the cathedral. Josephine Butler set up another hostel for women near their home. Political pressure from Liberal backbenchers, particularly Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Hopwood, led to increasing opposition to the Acts. In February 1883 Hopwood tabled a resolution in parliament: \\"That this House disapproves of the compulsory examination of women under the Contagious Diseases Acts\\", which was debated in April. MPs voted by a majority of 72 to suspend the inspections; three years later the Acts were formally repealed. =Child prostitution and Eliza Armstrong; 1885‚Äì1887= In 1885 Butler met Florence Soper Booth, the daughter- in-law of William Booth, who founded the Salvation Army. The meeting led to Butler's involvement in the campaign to expose child prostitution in Britain and its associated trade. Along with Booth, Benjamin Scott the City Chamberlain and several supporters from the LNA, she persuaded the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, to help their cause. Stead considered the best way to prove that the purchase of young girls for prostitution took place in London, was to buy a girl himself. Butler introduced him to a former prostitute and brothel owner who was staying in her hostel. In a slum in Marylebone, Stead purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for ¬£5, and took her to France. In July 1885 Stead began the publication of a series of articles entitled \\"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\\", exposing the extent of child prostitution in London. In the first article‚Äîwhich covered six pages of the Gazette‚ÄîStead recounted an interview he had with Howard Vincent, the head of the Criminal Investigation Department: On 16 July‚Äîten days after the article was published‚ÄîButler gave a speech at a meeting at London's Exeter Hall calling for increased protection for the young and the raising of the age of consent. The following day she and George left for a holiday in Switzerland and France. While they were away, a moribund parliamentary bill from 1883 dealing with the age of consent was re-debated by MPs; the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 was passed on 14 August 1885. The Act raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age, while the procurement of girls for prostitution by administering drugs, intimidation or fraud was made a criminal offence, as was the abduction of a girl under 18 for purposes of carnal knowledge. The police investigated Stead's purchase, and Butler was forced to cut her holiday short to return for questioning. Although she avoided all charges, Stead was imprisoned for three months. The passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act led to the formation of purity societies, such as the White Cross Army, whose aims were to force the closure of brothels through prosecution. The societies widened their remit to suppress what they considered indecent literature‚Äîincluding information on birth control‚Äîand the entertainment provided by the music halls. Butler warned against the purity societies because of their \\"fatuous belief that you can oblige human beings to be moral by force, and in so doing that you may in some way promote social purity\\". Her warnings went unheeded by other suffragists, and some, such as Millicent Fawcett‚Äîwho was later Butler's biographer‚Äîcontinued to combine their activities in the feminist movement with the work for the purity societies. =India, Empire and the final years; 1897‚Äì1906= Butler in old age, by George Frederic Watts, 1894 Although the Contagious Diseases Acts had been repealed in the UK, the equivalent legislation was active in the British Raj in India, where prostitutes near the British cantonments were subjected to regular forced examinations. The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General Edward Chapman, who issued standing orders for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of \\"a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses\\". Butler began a new campaign to have the legislation repealed, comparing the girls to slaves. After the campaign put pressure on MPs, the widespread publication of Chapman's orders led to what Mathers describes as \\"outrage across Britain\\". In June 1888 the House of Commons passed a unanimous resolution repealing the legislation, and the Indian government was ordered to cancel the Acts. To circumvent the order, the India Office advised the Viceroy of India to instigate new legislation ensuring that prostitutes suspected of carrying contagious diseases had to undergo an examination or face expulsion from the cantonment. Towards the end of the 1880s George's health began to decline, and Butler spent increasing time looking after him. They holidayed in Naples in 1889, but George contracted influenza in the 1889‚Äì90 pandemic. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890; Butler suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death. Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in Wimbledon, London, which she shared with her eldest son and his wife. Butler, at 62, felt she was too old to travel to India, but two American supporters visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes‚Äîsome as young as 11‚Äîwere all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Butler spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India. Although many of Butler's friends and supporters of shared causes spoke out against British Imperial Policy, Butler did not. She wrote that because of the work Britain had undertaken in making slavery illegal, \\"[w]ith all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the least guilty of the nations\\". During the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), Butler published Native Races and the War (1900), in which she supported British action and its imperialist policy. In the book she took a strong line against the casual racism inherent in her countrymen's dealings with foreigners, writing: From 1901 Butler began to withdraw from public life, resigning her positions in the campaign organisations and spending more time with her family. In 1903 she moved to Wooler in Northumberland, to live near her eldest son. On 30 December 1906 she died at home and was buried in the nearby village of Kirknewton. Approach, analysis and legacy In 1907 Josephine Butler's name was added to the south side of the Reformers' Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. The memorial was erected for those \\"who had defied custom and interest for the sake of conscience and public good\\". She is celebrated in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 May, and represented in a stained glass window in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, All Saints' Church, Cambridge and St Olave's Church in the City of London. Her connections to Liverpool were memorialised in a more secular fashion. A building in the Faculty of Business and Law at Liverpool John Moores University was named \\"Josephine Butler House\\". The building, originally the first Radium Institute in the UK, in the Cultural Quarter in Hope Street, was built in 1867 and demolished in 2013 when the site became a car park and subsequently student housing which opened in 2015. In 1915 the LNA merged with the International Abolitionist Federation to form the Association of Moral and Social Hygiene, which changed its name to the Josephine Butler Society in 1953. As at 2017 the society still operates; it campaigns for the protection of prostitutes and provides \\"protection for women and children who are criminally detained, violently abused or exploited by others who profit from their prostitution\\". In 2005 Durham University named Josephine Butler College after her, reflecting her and George's connection to the area and the university. The Women's Library, at the London School of Economics, holds a number of collections related to Butler. They include papers from the Ladies' National Association; more than 2,500 letters in the Josephine Butler Letter Collection; and the Josephine Butler Society Library consisting of books and pamphlets collected by the society. In 2001 English Heritage placed a blue plaque on her former residence in Wimbledon; her former house in Cheltenham was demolished in the 1970s, but in 2002 the Cheltenham Civic Society placed a plaque on the building which now occupies the site. Butler was not only a staunch feminist but a passionate Christian, whose favourite phrase was \\"God and one woman make a majority\\". Although staunchly liberal, she felt constant tensions between her liberal and feminist philosophies. According to the feminist historian Barbara Caine, \\"Liberalism provided the framework for Butler's whole social and political approach. It was an integral part of her feminism\\", although it was in conflict with the liberal approach to sexuality and desire. Butler resolved the conflict through her religion. According to Walkowitz, Butler \\"pushed liberal feminism in new directions, developing theories and methods of political agitation that directly affected future campaigns for the emancipation of women\\". She developed new approaches to campaigning and moved the debate beyond discussions in middle-class houses to the public forum, bringing into the political debate women who had never been involved before. Butler's campaigning, says Walkowitz, \\"not only reshaped gender, class, and sexual subjectivities in late Victorian Britain but also informed national political history and state-building\\". Numerous historians consider the success of the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts to be a milestone in the history of female emancipation. According to the political historian Margaret Hamilton, the campaign showed that \\"attitudes toward women were changing\\". The feminist scholar Sheila Jeffreys says that Butler is \\"one of the bravest and most imaginative feminists in history\\", while Fawcett wrote that she was \\"convinced that ... [Butler] should take the rank of the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century\\".

Its signal has been simulcast on the Internet by ibiblio since November 1994 and is credited as having performed the first Internet radio broadcast in the world.WXYC Simulcast This Is Radio Web It can also be found on iTunes, where, based on listener feedback, it would appear to enjoy some popularity in the UK and the American Northeast among Internet listeners. The station is known for an eclectic variety of content, including: jazz, blues, rock, hip hop, zydeco, metal, electronic music, folk music, bluegrass, country, traditional Asian music, traditional African music, calypso, samba, tejano, mariachi, Latin American music, funk, electroclash, synthpop, pop, cajun, doo wop, reggae, dance hall, classical, classic rock, and almost any other type of music. There is a stated emphasis on music from the 20th century onwards (as opposed to classical), though classical music is played from time to time. Furthermore, there is a conscious attempt to give artists from North Carolina (especially the greater Chapel Hill area) more air time, but local artists do not dominate the content. There are also specialty talk shows that highlight sports, news, and student government at UNC. Specialty music shows exhibit material from UNC's Southern Folklife Collection, music usually considered too erratic, abrasive, or long for regular radio play (even by WXYC's permissive standards), local music, newly released music, and electronic/dance. Additionally, every Thursday night there is a three-hour theme show. The theme of this show changes every week, but a few examples include: songs about chickens, music from Mexico, Swing music from occupied Europe, the northern England electronic scene, batucada, music performed by convicted criminals, and Carolina Soul of the 1960s through 1980s. WXYC's offices and studios are located in the Frank Porter Graham Student Union on the campus of the University of North Carolina. WXYC's transmitter is located on Jones Ferry Road in Chatham County, North Carolina. WXYC is known for putting on dances throughout the year with various themes, including the 80s, the early 1990s, and the best music released in the past year. History Prior to 1977, WXYC was a carrier current AM station known as WCAR. Until 1970, several UNC residence colleges had their own carrier current stations. Morrison Dormitory had WMO, Ehringhaus had WSTD, Granville Towers had WILD and Hinton James also had its own station. In the fall of 1969, Hinton James joined Ehringhaus to form WRSC (Radio South Campus). Meanwhile, Morrison and Granville Towers formed WCAR which broadcast from the basement of Granville West. In January 1970, all of these stations consolidated into WCAR. The WCAR studios were located in the basement of Ehringhaus Dormitory and broadcast to every other dorm via AM frequency 550 kHz. The management of WCAR planned to upgrade the service with the hope of eventually getting an FM license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). At that time, it was anticipated that the station would serve as a training ground for future broadcasters and not act solely an outlet for, what was called at the time, \\"progressive rock\\". In order to achieve their ambitious plans, many WCAR staff members ran for Student Legislature (SL). In 1972, a running joke around campus was that the SL was made up of three parties, the liberals, the conservatives, and WCAR. Through the shrewd use of political power, WCAR was allocated the funds necessary to move its studios and offices to the Frank Porter Graham Student Union in 1973. UNC students Jim Srebro, Gary Rendsburg, Jim Bond, Bob Heymann, Randy Wolfe, Monte Plott, and George Frye were all instrumental in the upgrading of facilities and doing the preliminary engineering and legal work in order to be licensed as an FM station. A student referendum was held in 1973 to allocate the necessary funds to formally apply for and build an FM station. Through the work of WCAR volunteers, the referendum passed. In 1974, WCAR received its construction permit from the FCC to begin building its FM station. When the UNC Administration realized that this \\"new\\" FM station would be licensed with over 10,000 watts of power and therefore could be clearly heard in Raleigh and by members of the North Carolina General Assembly, it pulled its support for the entire project. The FCC subsequently canceled the construction permit. In response, WCAR's management formed a not-for-profit corporation, Student Educational Broadcasting, Inc., which would become the new licensee of WXYC. Jim Srebro served as the first Chairman of Student Educational Broadcasting, Inc. In the intervening time, however, other new FM stations were licensed by the FCC in North Carolina which limited WXYC to only 400 watts of power when it went on the air in March 1977. In 2009 the station relocated its transmitter facilities and increased power to 1,100 watts. In 1994 WXYC disc jockey Michael Shoffner set up the station's Internet radio broadcast, which runs to this day and is widely considered to be the first such broadcast. North Carolina Public Radio (WUNC) is also affiliated with the university.

This liquid substance is the origin of all living things: the first giant Ymir was conceived from eitr. The substance is supposed to be very poisonous and is also produced by J√∂rmungandr (the Midgard serpent) and other serpents. Etymology The word eitr exists in most North Germanic languages (all derived from the Old Norse language) in Icelandic/Faroese eitur, in Danish edder, in Swedish etter. Cognates also exist in Dutch etter (pus), in German Eiter (pus), in Old Saxon ƒïttar, in Old English ƒÉttor. The word is broadly translated: poisonous, evil, bad, angry, sinister etc.Svenska Akademiens Ordbok, entry for Etter The word is used in common Scandinavian folklore as a synonym for snake venom. Ymir In Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l Odin asks the Giant Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir about the origin of Ymir.

Popular culture In Tomb Raider: Underworld, which features a storyline heavily influenced by Norse mythology, eitr plays an important part in the plot.

Construction of the new road started in the Spring of 2005 and it was opened on 23 May 2007. Barnstaple Western Bypass during construction Completed bridge over the River Taw History The scheme consists of a single two-lane carriageway, one roundabout and three traffic signal controlled junctions. of new road was constructed and a long, five- span, downstream bridge was built across the River Taw. A new roundabout was created between the Newport and Roundswell roundabouts: this has a feeder lane which provides easy access from the A39 Atlantic Highway to the A361 Braunton Road which generates much of Barnstaple's traffic. The bridge is a balanced cantilever design with reinforced concrete box girders supporting the arms. Other constructions include stream culverts, two pedestrian/cycleway underpasses, minor retaining walls, and a 100-metre three span viaduct providing access for buses, cyclists and pedestrians to Barnstaple railway station. The plans allowed for reopening of the Barnstaple-Bideford railway, should this become financially viable. As with any project of this scale, many companies were employed in the development. Edmund Nuttall Ltd., a major civil engineering group, was the main contractor. It was estimated to cost ¬£42 million. ¬£38 million of this amount came from the central government. Devon County Council also contributed. An economic impact study estimated that after 5 years the project would generate an extra ¬£248 million in business turnover and would create 1,280 jobs. =Opening ceremony= Up to 20,000 people were expected to attend the Taw Bridge Family Fun Day. The event was organised to raise money for charity and to commemorate the completion of the Western Bypass and Downstream Bridge. The ceremony took place on the Pottington side of the bridge at 11:00 and members of the public were able to walk over the new bridge from 11:30. A Fun Run started from Park School at 12:00. At 14:30 A tug-of-war competition took place on the bridge itself . A final grand parade was to start at 16:00 and at 17:30 an evening concert in St Peter's Church was to end the day. North Devon Gazette Critics Critics said that the Western Bypass would endanger wildlife and the environment. Friends of the Earth campaigner and Green Party candidate Anthony Bown claimed it would disturb large numbers of seabirds on the Taw and Torridge Estuary, along with the habitat of endangered otters. They are also worried that the bypass will attract more vehicles and therefore further contribute to pollution, but it has also been argued that the bypass will reduce pollution by substantially reducing traffic jams and journey times in and around Barnstaple. Some locals are also upset that the decoration chosen for one of the new roundabouts comprises Cornish stone, as the road is really a gateway to North Devon. Taw Bridge from Barnstaple The old railway line from Barnstaple to Bideford was partially built over, meaning it will be more expensive to re-open the line in the future.

Based on the Torino, the mid-size two-door coupe was intended to be a less expensive Thunderbird alternative to compete with the increasingly popular intermediate personal luxury class of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Buick Regal, Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba. It was essentially the concurrent Mercury Cougar XR-7 with a mild front end restyling to resemble the Thunderbird, different taillamps with a center reflector, unique twin opera windows and large color-keyed vinyl moldings placed higher on the bodysides. The interiors were identical save for upholstery styles and minor trim. Introduced February 18th, 1974 as the Gran Torino Elite, it was initially the top of the line model of the Torino series. Although advertised separately, it was titled and registered as a Gran Torino. For 1975 and 1976, the Gran Torino prefix was dropped and Elite became a stand-alone model nameplate. Early pre- production publicity photos for the 1974 model show the use of Gran Torino XL nameplates. The Elite name was dropped after 1976 because the Ford mid-size range was restructured for the 1977 model year. The Thunderbird was dramatically reduced in size and price for 1977 by moving the nameplate to the Torino-based LTD II platform which replaced the Torino. In effect, the Elite continued restyled and marketed under the more-recognized Thunderbird name, and the previous full-sized Thunderbird was discontinued.

In Mexico and Venezuela  The Elite name was also used in Mexico. The Ford Fairmont was introduced in Mexico in late 1977 as a 1978 model, replacing the Ford Maverick that was produced there locally. The Futura coupe with its distinctive Thunderbird-styled roofline was never offered in Mexico. Instead there was an uplevel 2-door sedan called the Fairmont Elite. It was distinguished from other Fairmonts by its higher level of equipment and vinyl roof. It used the four headlight grille from the Fairmont Futura along with Mercury Zephyr taillamps and rear quarter window louvers. For 1981, the Fairmont Elite switched to the Mercury Zephyr grille. For 1982, the Fairmont Elite was renamed Ford Elite II, which was now offered in two- and four-door sedans. It continued to use the body of the Fairmont with the front end of the North American 1982 Ford Granada and matching rear bumper. The rear continued to use Mercury Zephyr taillamps. From 1983 to 1985, a version of the North American Fox platform Ford LTD was manufactured in Venezuela and marketed as the Ford Granada Elite in uplevel trim.

He is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which was first published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump in 1987 and has to date sold over 100 million copies in Japan alone. The series is known for frequent references to Western rock music, fashion, and Italy, all of which Araki is reportedly very fond of. History =Early life= Araki grew up in Sendai, Japan with his parents and younger identical twin sisters. He cites his sisters' annoyances as the reason he spent time alone in his room reading manga, naming Ai to Makoto as the most important one to him, and his father's art books, he supposes this was his motive for drawing manga. He was particularly influenced by the work of French artist Paul Gauguin. After a school friend praised his manga, he began secretly drawing manga behind his parent's backs. He submitted his first work to a magazine in his first year of high school. All his submissions were rejected while other artists his age or younger were making successful debuts. He decided to go to the publishers' offices in Tokyo to find out why in person, taking a manga he stayed up all-night to finish. The Shueisha editor he met highly criticized the work, but said it had potential and to clean it up for the upcoming Tezuka Awards. The manga was Poker Under Arms. =Debut and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure= Araki left Miyagi University of Education before graduating, and made his debut under the name in 1980 with the wild west one-shot Poker Under Arms, which was a \\"Selected Work\\" at that year's Tezuka Award. His first serialization was Cool Shock B.T. in 1983, about a young magician who solves mysteries. But the first series to display his signature amount of gore was 1984's Baoh. It tells the story of a man who is implanted with a parasite by an evil organization, giving him superhuman powers, and follows as he fights against them. It was adapted into an OVA in 1989, the manga was released in the US by Viz Media in 1990 (in tank≈çbon form in 1995), but the OVA didn't get a stateside release until 2002. It wasn't until The Gorgeous Irene in 1985, that he really developed his signature art style of buff, muscular characters (it would later become more flamboyant). His next series would become his magnum opus, 1987's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The series begins in 1880s England and follows Jonathan Joestar (JoJo) and his adopted brother Dio Brando, who eventually tries to kill their father in order to obtain his share of inheritance. When confronted, Dio puts on an ancient mask that turns him into a vampire. JoJo then learns a breathing technique called hamon, and travels to Dio's castle to kill him. Subsequent arcs of JoJo follow the descendants of the Joestar family, and many are set in different parts of the world. Part 3, which would become the most popular part in the series, downplays the vampire story and hamon technique and instead introduces the power of Stands, which continues in the series today. Still being serialized over 30 years later, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has been adapted into numerous other forms of media and the manga had 100 million collected volumes in print by December 2016. Since 2011, Araki has produced JoJolion, the eighth story arc of the series, serialized in Ultra Jump magazine. =Recent work= The September 2007 issue of Cell had a cover drawn by Araki with a ligase represented as one of his Stands. In 2008, Araki drew the cover art for a collection featuring Yasunari Kawabata's short story \\"The Dancing Girl of Izu\\". He drew the cover for the limited edition of Base Ball Bear's \\"Breeeeze Girl\\" single, which actually takes an image from the JoJo manga. Also in 2009, Hirohiko Araki was one of five artists selected by the Mus√©e du Louvre to create original works set at the famous museum. His piece Rohan at the Louvre starred JoJo's Rohan Kishibe and was shown at the exhibit titled Le Louvre invite la bande dessin√©e (\\"The Louvre Invites Comic-Strip Art\\"), which was created to show the diversity of comics, from January 19 to April 13. Rohan at the Louvre was highly praised. The following year, Rohan at the Louvre was published in France and ran in Japan's Ultra Jump. It was released in the US by NBM Publishing in February 2012. From September 17 to October 6, 2011, the Gucci store in Shinjuku hosted the Gucci x Hirohiko Araki x Spur \\"Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci\\" Exhibition, a collaboration between the luxury Italian clothing brand, JoJo's creator and the fashion magazine Spur. The exhibit celebrated the 90th anniversary of Gucci and featured a life-size figure of Rohan Kishibe, as well as numerous illustrations by Araki; including actual pieces of the brand's own 2011-2012 fall/winter collection and his own original fashion designs. For Spur, Araki drew Kishibe Rohan meets Gucci., a full-color one-shot featuring Rohan Kishibe that ran in its October 2011 issue. Spur once again ran a JoJo spinoff by Araki, Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci starring Jolyne Cujoh from Part 6, in their February 2013 issue. A free English translation is available on Gucci's Facebook page. To raise awareness of the ongoing reconstruction efforts of the Hiraizumi ruins, that were damaged by the March 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June, Araki drew artwork depicting the ruins. A \\"Hirohiko Araki JoJo Exhibition\\" opened in Araki's native Sendai at the end of July 2012 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, it then moved to Tokyo in October. He drew the album cover for Sayuri Ishikawa's 2012 album X -Cross-, where she performs one of the series' iconic poses and is drawn wearing jewelry from the manga, the cover of the 2012 reprint of Tamaki Sait≈ç's Lacan for Surviving, and the cover of the 2015 compilation album for composer Akira Senju. A book explaining Araki's methodology on creating manga, titled , was released on April 17, 2015 in Japan; an English translation was later released on June 6, 2017.https://yattatachi.com/june-2017-manga-releases#june13 A stage adaptation of Araki's 1994 one-shot Under Execution, Under Jailbreak ran from November 20 to November 29, 2015, at the Galaxy Theatre, then touring the country in December. The play also included elements of his 1996 one-shot Dolce, and His Master.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on Easter Sunday, April 4, 1999. It is the first of The Simpsons now annual trilogy episodes, and consists of four self-contained segments. In the episode, the Simpson family fall asleep during a sermon in church. Marge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Lisa dreams that she and her fellow Springfield Elementary School students are Hebrew slaves in Ancient Egypt and guides Moses to lead them to freedom, Homer dreams that he is King Solomon called to resolve a dispute between Lenny and Carl over the ownership of a pie, and Bart dreams he is King David, who has to fight Goliath's son, Goliath II. \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" was written by Matt Selman, Larry Doyle and Tim Long, and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for The Simpsons. While executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully stated that the idea for the episode came after Fox requested an Easter-themed episode, co- writer Selman argued that it was conceived by former staff writers Dan Greaney and Donick Cary while they were pitching ideas for the tenth season. Because the episode mostly takes place outside Springfield, the animators had to design completely new sets. While the episode mostly features references to the Old Testament and Christianity, it also parodies children's television programs, American politicians and action films by Jerry Bruckheimer. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 12.2 million viewers, Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics, but won an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production. In 2007, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set, and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The episode's ending scene is one of series creator Matt Groening's favorite moments on The Simpsons. The episode has been credited with fostering a critical literacy towards religion and the Bible among its viewers. Plot It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, and no one is interested in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate is passed around, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny that he found in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it a wicked idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep. =Marge's Dream= Marge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the forbidden tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks of a way of getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden. =Lisa's Dream= Lisa imagines she and all the other Springfield Elementary students are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if it is going to be smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna. =Homer's Dream= Homer pictures himself as King Solomon. Lenny and Carl fight over ownership of a pie. King Solomon cuts it in half, sentences Lenny and Carl to death, and then eats the pie. King Solomon then presides over a civil case between Jesus and Checker Chariot. =Bart's Dream= Bart sees himself as King David, who kills Goliath, but has not won the war yet: Nelson is Goliath II, Goliath's son. Goliath II has killed Methuselah (Grampa), David's oldest friend in revenge. In retaliation, David challenges Goliath II, but having no stones to sling at him, David loses and is catapulted from the city. David then meets Ralph, a shepherd, who claims he can kill Goliath II. Ralph dies, which enrages David even more. He then trains to try to slay Goliath. Having to climb up the enormous Tower of Babel beforehand, David manages to kill Goliath by throwing a lit lantern down his throat. Goliath is surprisingly still alive, but is quickly killed by Ralph's gravestone, hurled by Ralph himself, who also had not died. Much to his shock, David is sent to jail as the townspeople claim that Goliath was the best King they ever had, building roads, libraries and hospitals. The dream ends with a title card that reads \\"A Bart Simpson Dream\\". =Ending sequence= As the family wakes up, they find themselves alone in the church. Upon exiting they realize that the Apocalypse has come; fire rains from a red sky, and the Four Horsemen ride past. The Flanders ascend into Heaven, but The Simpsons do not; Lisa begins to ascend, but Homer grabs her leg and pulls her back down. Instead, the Simpsons descend via a staircase into Hell, where Homer follows the delicious scent of barbecue. The episode ends with Homer screaming in agony (because there are no hot dogs and hamburgers, there is pineapple in the coleslaw, and German potato salad) as \\"Highway to Hell\\" by AC/DC plays over the credits. Production \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" was co-written by Matt Selman, Larry Doyle and Tim Long, and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for The Simpsons. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 4, 1999, the day Easter took place that year. According to executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully, the idea for the episode was conceived when Fox requested an Easter-themed Simpsons episode that would air on the holiday. Normally, Fox would not broadcast any new Simpsons episodes on Easter, as it is considered a \\"low-ratings night\\", but \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" was an exception.Scully, Mike. (2007). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. However, according to co-writer Selman, the idea for the episode came about when he and former staff writer Dan Greaney were pitching episode ideas for the tenth season with former staff writer Donick Cary. Cary and Greaney suggested a \\"bible-trilogy\\" story, which then became \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\".Selman, Matt. (2007). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" is the first of the trilogy episodes which, since the season 12 episode \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", The Simpsons produces once every season. Matt Selman wrote the episode together with Tim Long and Larry Doyle. The first segment was written by Long. According to former staff writer Tom Martin, Long wanted the pig in the garden of Eden to have a \\"Tony British\\" accent.Martin, Tom. (2007). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The pig was voiced by regular cast member Hank Azaria, who portrays Moe Szyslak among other characters in the series.Groening, Matt. (2007). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The unicorn that digs a hole from the garden of Eden was portrayed by Tress MacNeille. The second segment was written by Doyle. The episode's third segment was written by Selman. When writing segments for trilogy episodes, the writing staff usually follow the stories they are based on, while putting The Simpsons characters in the original characters' place. With \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\"' third segment, Selman stated that he wanted to go a \\"fresh new way\\" by instead writing a sequel to the story of David and Goliath. According to Scully, Selman had a very clear vision of how he wanted the segment to be, and Selman said that he wanted to make a \\"dog's breakfast\\" of movie clich√©s at the time. The song that plays during Bart's training montage is \\"Winner Takes It All\\" by American rock singer Sammy Hagar. Selman decided to include the song after hearing it in the 1987 action drama film Over the Top. According to Doyle, the scene was originally much longer, almost seven minutes in length.Doyle, Larry. (2007). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The song that plays during the episode's end credits is \\"Highway to Hell\\" by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. According to Scully, the staff could not use the song on The Simpsons at first, since AC/DC's record company refused to sell it. However, when Scully called the band's manager directly, it turned out he had not been told about the request. Scully said that when they asked if they could use \\"Highway to Hell\\", the band's manager \\"signed on right away\\" and gave the Simpsons staff a \\"huge discount.\\" Because most of the episode takes place in ancient history, the animators had to create completely new sets and designs for the episode. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Kruse stated that she and staff animator Alex Ruiz had to re-draw a majority of the episode, as the faulty scenes were drawn by six trainees. In order to receive an animator credit on The Simpsons, an animator has to draw ten scenes in an episode. Because the trainees did not draw ten scenes each, none of them were credited for their work on the episode. All the trainees were later hired to The Simpsons animation staff. Kruse stated that, while animating the episode, she was worried that the animation department would be offended by the episode's content, as many of the crew members were \\"very religious\\". However, as animation ensued, she found that most of the animators were not uncomfortable with the episode, as it mostly parodies the Old Testament. The only complaint she received was from an animator who refused to animate Jesus in the court room scene in Homer's dream.Kruse, Nancy. (2007). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that he regretted not submitting \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" for the Primetime Emmy Award in the category of animated programming less than one hour in 1999. At the time, Scully reasoned that, because the original stories were not conceived by the writing staff, the episode would not hold up. However, he noted that the episode's animation was \\"outstanding\\", and that he later found out that the Emmy awards \\"put a lot of importance on\\" the animation in submitted episodes. Instead of submitting \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" for the Emmy awards in 1999, Scully submitted \\"Viva Ned Flanders\\", which ultimately lost to the King of the Hill episode \\"And They Call It Bobby Love\\". Cultural references \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" contains several references to the Hebrew prophets, holy book, and the religion as a whole, as well as films based on the Bible. Each segment is based on a biblical story, mostly from the Old Testament. The first segment is based on the story of Adam and Eve, who, according to the Book of Genesis were the first man and woman created by God. Ned Flanders has the role of God, while the serpent that lures Marge into eating an apple from the forbidden tree resembles Snake Jailbird. The Garden of Eden was the place where Adam and Eve lived after they were created by God, according to the Book of Genesis. Bart's dream contains references to several action films, including those produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The second segment parodies Moses who, according to the Book of Exodus, freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Milhouse has the role of Moses while Skinner has the role of the Pharaoh. When the Pharaoh asked who vandalized his sarcophagus, the burning bush tells him that Bart did it. When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh's guards, he exclaims \\"No, the bush set me up!\\" Bart's line refers to the 1990 arrest of Marion Barry who, while being arrested by the FBI for smoking crack cocaine, exclaimed \\"No, the bitch set me up!\\" In a scene in the segment, Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner's tent. The scene refers to the second of ten Biblical plagues that were imposed on Egypt by God, in chapters 7-12 of the Book of Exodus. While they are inside the torture chamber, Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb. The orb is called \\"Orb of Isis\\" and played a big part in the season 9 episode \\"Lost Our Lisa\\". In another scene, Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape. The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film The Ten Commandments, in which Moses parts the Red Sea. The shot in which Pharaoh and his guards are drowning is also taken from the movie. In Homer's dream, Homer has the role of King Solomon who, according to the Books of Kings and Book of Chronicles was a King of Israel, as well as one of the 48 prophets according to the Talmud. Bart's dream shows Bart as King David and, rather than telling the story of David and Goliath, Bart's dream is a \\"sequel\\" to the story. The segment is inspired by and contains references to several films by Jerry Bruckheimer, including Die Hard and Lethal Weapon, and borrows elements from other action films. At one point in the segment, Bart's dog Santa's Little Helper starts talking to him. The dog's voice is similar to that of Goliath in the stop-motion animated television series Davey and Goliath. Inside the whale skeleton in the episode, Bart finds the remains of Jonah. Jonah was a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel, according to the Hebrew Bible. Nelson lives in the Tower of Babel which, according to the Book of Genesis, was an enormous tower that the humans built in order to reach heaven. After being defeated by Bart, Nelson reappears while a variation of Modest Mussorgsky's composition St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain plays in the background. At the end of the segment, Bart is arrested and Chief Wiggum says \\"Where's your messiah now?\\" Wiggum's line was also taken from The Ten Commandments, from a character played by Edward G. Robinson, on whom Wiggum's voice is based. King David's (Bart) training montage of arm-wrestling with his sheep is a reference to the film Over the Top, complete with Sammy Hagar's \\"Winner Takes It All\\" from the film. Release and reception In its original American broadcast on April 4, 1999, \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" received a 7.4 Nielsen rating, translating to approximately 7.4 million viewers. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 12.2 million viewers watched the episode, a considerable drop from the previous episode, which was seen by an estimated 15.5 million viewers. David Bianculli of New York Daily News attributed the loss in viewership to the fact that the episode aired on a religious holiday. Nevertheless, it was the week's second most watched program on the network. Later that year, the episode received an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production, the second year in a row that The Simpsons won the award. On August 7, 2007, \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Tom Martin, Larry Doyle, Matt Selman and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode. Although it is one of series creator Matt Groening's favorite moments in The Simpsons, fans of the series were uneasy about the episode's ending. Following its broadcast, \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide wrote that the episode is \\"A fantastic twist of the Treehouse of Horror style of storytelling,\\" and added that each segment is a \\"classic on its own\\". They wrote that Wiggum telling Moses and Lisa to give his regards to the British Museum as he seals them inside a tomb and Marge asking Bart if he is wearing clean underwear as they face the apocalypse were some of the episode's \\"best moments\\", and concluded by writing that the episode is \\"The Simpsons at its very best: inventive, irreverent and very, very funny.\\" While DVD Town's James Plath wrote that the episode's premise was \\"risky\\", he still enjoyed the episode. Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger described the episode as \\"hilarious\\", however they noted that the episode's \\"suggestion that Moses parted the Red Sea by having all the Israelites flush their toilets at once\\" could result in a backlash from the \\"religious right\\". On the other hand, giving the episode a negative review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" \\"proves less successful [than most Treehouse of Horror episodes]\\". He added that he \\"just think the brevity required by the inclusion of three separate tales better suits the world of horror spoofs than it does these Bible pieces,\\" as they \\"try to pack an awful lot into very little time.\\" He concluded by writing that, while the episode has \\"some good moments\\", he did not find a lot of entertainment in it. Aaron Roxby of Collider described \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" as his least- favorite trilogy episode, and wrote \\"Considering that, in earlier seasons, the show had some of the most thoughtfully edgy religious humor on television, this one feels surprisingly toothless.\\" However, he gave praise to the talking pig in the Garden of Eden. At the end of the episode, the Simpsons walk out of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun. While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts ascending into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says \\"Where do you think you're going, missy?\\" The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groening's favorite joke of the series. While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favorites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending \\"drives them [the fans] crazy\\", since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical. In 2007, Homer's line \\"Oh, I smell barbeque!\\" was included in Bobby Bryant of The State's list \\"20 Essential Things I've Learned From Homer Simpson\\". The same year, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, unveiled a new exhibit which galleried Biblical images in art and pop culture, including a promotional poster for \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\".

Smart antennas should not be confused with reconfigurable antennas, which have similar capabilities but are single element antennas and not antenna arrays. Smart antenna techniques are used notably in acoustic signal processing, track and scan radar, radio astronomy and radio telescopes, and mostly in cellular systems like W-CDMA, UMTS, and LTE. Smart antennas have many functions: DOA estimation, beamforming, interference nulling, and constant modulus preservation.. Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation The smart antenna system estimates the direction of arrival of the signal, using techniques such as MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification), estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) algorithms, Matrix Pencil method or one of their derivatives. They involve finding a spatial spectrum of the antenna/sensor array, and calculating the DOA from the peaks of this spectrum. These calculations are computationally intensive. Matrix Pencil is very efficient in case of real time systems, and under the correlated sources. Beamforming Beamforming is the method used to create the radiation pattern of the antenna array by adding constructively the phases of the signals in the direction of the targets/mobiles desired, and nulling the pattern of the targets/mobiles that are undesired/interfering targets. This can be done with a simple Finite Impulse Response (FIR) tapped delay line filter. The weights of the FIR filter may also be changed adaptively, and used to provide optimal beamforming, in the sense that it reduces the Minimum Mean Square Error between the desired and actual beampattern formed. Typical algorithms are the steepest descent, and Least Mean Squares algorithms. In digital antenna arrays with multi channels use the digital beamforming, usually by DFT or FFT. Types of smart antennas Two of the main types of smart antennas include switched beam smart antennas and adaptive array smart antennas. Switched beam systems have several available fixed beam patterns. A decision is made as to which beam to access, at any given point in time, based upon the requirements of the system. Adaptive arrays allow the antenna to steer the beam to any direction of interest while simultaneously nulling interfering signals. Beamdirection can be estimated using the so-called direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods. In 2008, the United States NTIA began a major effort to assist consumers in the purchase of digital television converter boxes. Through this effort, many people have been exposed to the concept of smart antennas for the first time. In the context of consumer electronics, a \\"smart antenna\\" is one that conforms to the EIA/CEA-909 Standard Interface. In 2017, the Israeli Aerospace Industries unveiled an adaptive array antenna called ADA, and stated that it is already operational and shall be fitted onto \\"major platforms\\" used by the Israel Defense Forces. Limited choice of EIA/CEA-909A smart antennas in the marketplace Prior to the final transition to ATSC digital television in the United States on June 11, 2009, two smart antenna models were brought to market: * RCA ANT2000 ‚Äì no longer available from retailers * DTA-5000 ‚Äì manufactured by Funai Electric, marketed under the \\"DX Antenna\\" brand name, sometimes associated with the Sylvania brand name; no longer available from retailers And two models are causing consumer confusion: * Although the Apex SM550 is capable of connecting to a CEA-909 port for the purpose of drawing electrical power, it is not a true smart antenna.The Official AVS 'Smart Antenna' Topic - Page 4. AVS Forum. * The unfortunately-named Channel Master 3000A and CM3000HD SMARTenna series are otherwise-conventional amplified omnidirectional antennas, not steerable smart antennas.Channel Master CM 3000 Suburban Outdoor Amplified Omnidirectional SMARTenna TV Antenna (CM3000A) at the Wayback Machine. * ADA - An adaptive antenna produced by MLM factory of the Israel Aerospace IndustriesADA GNSS Anti-Jamming System Extension of smart antennas Smart antenna systems are also a defining characteristic of MIMO systems , such as the IEEE 802.11n standard. Conventionally, a smart antenna is a unit of a wireless communication system and performs spatial signal processing with multiple antennas. Multiple antennas can be used at either the transmitter or receiver. Recently, the technology has been extended to use the multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver; such a system is called a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system . As extended Smart Antenna technology, MIMO supports spatial information processing, in the sense that conventional research on Smart Antennas has focused on how to provide a digital beamforming advantage by the use of spatial signal processing in wireless channels. Spatial information processing includes spatial information coding such as Spatial multiplexing and Diversity Coding, as well as beamforming.

As May approached her late teens, her family saw it was the time for her to be married. Phoebe Hearst, who was a close friend of her mother, funded May's extravagant debutante ball. She was 'brought out' in Washington. May was considered a great beauty with a petite figure, blue eyes and long fair hair attracting several suitors who courted her.Nakhjavani, p.47 The rejection of several marriage proposals frustrated her family. She was bought out again into Newport society in the hopes of finding a husband. May fell in love during this period and became engaged, but it was broken off. May plunged into depression, and it was around this time that her health seriously deteriorated.Hogenson, p.58 In late 1894, May moved to Paris with her mother and brother; who was attending the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. May's mother still hoped for her to marry, but May resented the Parisian high society. She went through periods of deep depression and insomnia and even considered entering a convent. In 1897 May lost both her grandmother and cousin whom she was very close to. At 27 May became obsessed with mortality and became bedridden leading to many of her family members believing she was going to die.Nakhjavani, p.52  Pilgrimage to Acre  In November 1898, Phoebe Hearst, accompanied by her nieces and other Bah√° º√≠s like Lua Getsinger, stopped off at Paris before concluding their journey to the East. Hearst was shocked to see 28-year-old May bedridden with the chronic malady which had inflicted her.Hogenson, p.60 She invited May to sojourn to the East with her believing the change of air to be conducive to her health. Getsinger also disclosed to May the purpose of the journey; a pilgrimage to visit the head of the Bah√° º√≠ religion  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°.Nakhjavani, p.70 May arrived in Acre in February 1899. She wrote of the first time she met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as \\"of that first meeting I can remember neither joy nor pain nor anything that I can name\\".  As a Bah√° º√≠  May returned to Paris and began teaching her new faith and played a significant role in introducing the religion to several people while in Paris. She helped convert several new believers, including Englishman Thomas Breakwell and Juliet Thompson. On her return five of the younger female pilgrims had a photograph commissioned and sent to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. On receiving the photograph he wrote a tablet addressed to the five, whom he named the \\"Five Holy Leaves\\". She met a close friend of her brother's, William Sutherland Maxwell, a Canadian of Scottish background, and the two married in 1902 in London. William had been introduced to the religion before their marriage but he did not become a Bah√° º√≠ until 1909, after meeting  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. The couple had one child, a daughter named Mary. The couple moved to Montreal, and May set up a Bah√° º√≠ center in her home. Prior to 1912, she supported a Children's Court for Montreal, and her efforts were chief in maintaining the Colborne Street Milk Station. In about 1914, she brought a Montessori teacher from New York to their home in Montreal to start the first school of this type in Canada. In Montreal May continued to convert people such as Arthur Armstrong, Rose Henderson and her husband's cousin Martha MacBean. In 1912  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° visited Canada and stayed with the Maxwells. She was an early participant at Green Acre, the first Bah√° º√≠ training facility in the United States. In 1927 she was a member of the US and Canada National Spiritual Assembly. In 1937, her life changed dramatically after her daughter, Mary, was married to Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith.  Death  Despite poor health, on January 24, 1940 May chose to leave New York on a steamship to Brazil, ultimately to land in Argentina to teach the Faith with her niece, Jeanne Bolles. She arrived in Buenos Aires on February 27 with elation; however on March 1, May died of a heart attack. Shoghi Effendi gave her the status of martyr and cabled the following: \\" ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s beloved handmaid, distinguished disciple May Maxwell (is) gathered (into the) glory (of the) Abh√° Kingdom.

Ghormley, superseded by Admiral William Halsey Jr. from 16 October, comprised four commands: Amphibious Forces, South Pacific (AmphibForSoPac), under Admiral Richmond K. Turner, South Pacific Naval Forces under Admiral Ghormley, U.S. Army Forces South Pacific under Major General Millard Harmon, and South Pacific Air Forces under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr..http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P- Strategy/Strategy-11.html At a later stage Transport Group, South Pacific (TransGrpSoPac) was added to the organisation. The organisation's first major battle was the Battle of Guadalcanal. Admiral Ghormley's Operations Order 1-42 established two task forces, Task Force 61 and Task Force 63, to carry out the operation. On September 20, 1942, six weeks after the first American amphibious operation of the war got underway at Guadalcanal, Vice Admiral Aubrey Fitch assumed command of Aircraft, South Pacific Force (AirSoPac). Not a desk-bound admiral, he carried out numerous, hazardous flights into the combat zones, inspecting air activities and bases for projected operations. For these, he received a Distinguished Flying Cross. AirSoPac ultimately encompassing U.S. Navy, Army, Marine Corps, and Royal New Zealand Air Force air units. It saw great success aiding the Allied campaign in the area. Commander, Aircraft, Solomons (ComAirSols), directed the combat operations of all land-based air forces in the Solomons during Operation Cartwheel, under the direction of AirSoPac.Shaw & Kane, History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II. Rear Admiral Charles P. Mason was the first officer to hold the title ComAirSols; he assumed command on 15 February 1943 at Guadalcanal. Actually, Mason took over a going concern, as he relieved Brigadier General Francis P. Mulcahy, who had controlled all aircraft stationed at the island during the final phase of its defense. Mulcahy, who became Mason's chief of staff, was also Commanding General, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing. The fact that a general headed the staff of an admiral is perhaps the best indication of the multiservice nature of AirSols operations. Vice Admiral Finch retained two areas of flight operations under his direct control; sea search by long range Navy patrol planes and Army bombers, and transport operations by South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT). Throughout its long and useful life (November 1942-February 1945), SCAT's complement of Marine and Army transports was headed by Marine Aircraft Group 25's commanding officer. SCAT's operations area moved northward with the fighting during 1943, and by August's end, all regularly scheduled flights in SoPac's rear areas were being handled by the Naval Air Transport Service (NATS).

A normal consular army during this period consisted of 2 legions, composed of Roman citizens only, and 2 allied alae. Alae were somewhat larger than normal legions (ca. 5,400 v. ca. 4,500 men). From the time of the first Roman emperor, Augustus (ruled 30 BC - AD 14), the term ala was used in the professional imperial army to denote a much smaller (ca. 500), purely cavalry unit of the non-citizen auxilia corps, see Ala (Roman cavalry unit). Mid-Republic When, at a later date, the Roman armies were composed partly of Roman citizens and partly of Socii (allies from the rest of the Italian mainland), either Latini or Italici, it became the practice to marshal the Roman troops in the centre of the battle line and the Socii upon the wings.

She is the most important Alusi in the Igbo pantheon. In Odinani, Ala rules over the underworld and holds the deceased ancestors in her womb. Her name literally translates to \\"ground\\" in the Igbo language, denoting her powers over the earth and her status as the ground itself. Ala is considered the highest Alusi in the Igbo pantheon.

In the past, such figures took the form of life-size mud sculptures in special festive shrines dedicated to the deity and known as mbari.

Construction  Construction of the first Randolph was authorized by the Continental Congress on 13 December 1775. The frigate, designed by Joshua Humphreys, was launched on 10 July 1776, by Wharton and Humphreys at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Captain Nicholas Biddle was appointed commander of the Randolph on 11 July, and he took charge of the frigate in mid-October. Maiden Voyage Seamen were scarce and recruiting was slow, delaying the ship's maiden voyage. Captured British seamen were \\"dragged\\" from jail in Philadelphia; the resulting riot required the soldiers appointed to carry the men to the ship to fire into the prison windows. Finally manned, Randolph sailed down the Delaware River on 3 February 1777, and three days later rounded Cape Henlopen, escorting a large group of American merchantmen to sea. On the 15th, the convoy separated, with some of Randolph's charges heading for France and the rest setting course for the West Indies. The frigate herself turned northward, hoping to encounter HMS Milford, a British frigate which had been capturing New England shipping. Before long, she boarded a ship which proved to be French and was set free. Then, as she continued the search, Randolph sprung her foremast. While the crew labored to rig a spar as a jury mast, the ship's mainmast broke and toppled into the sea. Continuing the hunt was out of the question. Now seeking to avoid the Royal Navy's warships, Biddle ordered the ship south toward the Carolina coast. Fever broke out as the Randolph painfully made her way, and many members of the crew were buried at sea. A mutiny of the captured British seamen had to be put down before the ship could reach Charleston, South Carolina, on the afternoon of 11 March. Voyage to Philadelphia Twice, after her repairs had been completed and as she was about to get underway, the frigate was kept in port by lightning-splintered mainmasts. Meanwhile, the ship, undermanned when she left Philadelphia, was losing more of her men from sickness, death, and desertion. Recruiting was stimulated by bounty, and Randolph was finally readied for sea - this time with her masts protected by lightning rods. She departed Charleston on 16 August and entered Rebellion Road to await favorable winds to put to sea. Two days later, a party from the frigate boarded merchantman Fair American, and impressed two seamen who earlier had been lured away from Biddle's ship. Inshore winds kept Randolph in the roadstead until the breeze shifted on 1 September, wafting the frigate across Charleston Bar. At dusk, on the 3rd, a lookout spotted five vessels: two ships, two brigs, and a sloop. After a nightlong chase, she caught up with her quarry the next morning and took four prizes: a 20-gun privateer, True Briton, laden with rum, for the British troops at New York; Severn, the second prize, had been recaptured by True Briton from a North Carolina privateer while sailing from Jamaica to London with a cargo of sugar, rum, ginger, and logwood; the two brigs, Charming Peggy, a French privateer, and L‚ÄôAssomption, laden with salt, had also been captured by True Briton while plying their way from Martinique to Charleston. Randolph and her rich prizes reached Charleston on the morning of 6 September. While the frigate was in port having her hull scraped, the president of South Carolina's General Assembly, John Rutledge, suggested to Biddle that Randolph, aided by a number of State Navy ships, might be able to break the blockade which was then bottling up a goodly number of American merchantmen in Charleston Harbor. Biddle accepted command of the task force, which, besides Randolph, included General Moultrie, Notre Dame, Fair American, and Polly. The American ships sailed on 14 February 1778. When they crossed the bar, Biddle's ships found no British cruisers. After seeing a number of merchantmen to a good offing, the ships proceeded to the West Indies hoping to intercept British merchantmen. After two days, they took and burned a dismasted New England ship which had been captured by a British privateer while headed for St. Augustine, Florida. Thereafter, game was scarce. They encountered only neutral ships until Polly took a small schooner on 4 March bound from New York to Grenada. Biddle manned the prize as a tender.  Loss  On the afternoon of 7 March, Randolphs lookouts spotted sail on the horizon. At 21:00 that evening, that ship, now flying British colors, came up on the Randolph as the largest ship in the convoy, and demanded they hoist their colors. The Randolph then hoisted American colors and fired a broadside into the British ship, mistakenly believing the ship to be a large sloop. The stranger turned out to be the British 64-gun ship of the line, HMS Yarmouth. As a 64-gun, two-deck line-of-battle ship, Yarmouth had double the number of guns as Randolph. Yarmouths guns were also significantly heavier, mounting 32 pound cannons on her main deck, 18 pounder guns on her upper deck and 9 pounder guns on her quarterdeck and forecastle, giving her almost five times the weight of shot that Randolph could fire. The Randolph and General Moultrie engaged Yarmouth until the Randolphs magazine exploded with a blinding flash. The Yarmouth was struck with burning debris up to six feet long, which significantly damaged her sails and rigging as well as killing five, and wounding twelve. The damage caused to Yarmouths sails and rigging prevented her from pursuing the remaining South Carolina ships which slipped away in the darkness. The loss of the Randolph resulted in the deaths of 311 of her crew, including Capt. Nicholas Biddle, with 4 survivors.

Translations of the penitential psalms were undertaken by some of the greatest poets in Renaissance England, including Sir Thomas Wyatt, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and Sir Philip Sidney. Before the suppression of the minor orders and tonsure in 1972 by Paul VI, the seven penitential psalms were assigned to new clerics after having been tonsured.Ordinations, Alleluia Press, 1962. See also the Pontificalia Romanum.  Musical settings  Perhaps the most famous musical setting of all seven is by Orlande de Lassus, with his Psalmi Davidis poenitentiales of 1584. There are also settings by Andrea Gabrieli and by Giovanni Croce. The Croce pieces are unique in being settings of Italian sonnet-form translations of the Psalms by Francesco Bembo. These were widely distributed; they were translated into English and published in London as Musica Sacra; and were even translated (back) into Latin and published in N√ºrnberg as Septem Psalmi poenitentiales. William Byrd set all seven Psalms in English versions for three voices in his Songs of Sundrie Natures (1589). Settings of individual penitential psalms have been written by many composers. Well-known settings of the Miserere (Psalm 50/51) include those by Gregorio Allegri and Josquin des Prez; yet another is by Bach. Settings of the De profundis (Psalm 129/130) include two in the Renaissance by Josquin.

The name This name comes from Hebrew ◊§◊ô◊™◊ï◊ù Pithom which was taken from the Late Egyptian name *Pi- îAt≈çm (< *Par- îAtƒÅma) 'House of Atum'. Atum, a solar deity, was one of the major gods of ancient Egypt, and a sun-god of Heliopolis. Biblical Pithom Pithom is one of the cities which, according to Exodus , was built for the Pharaoh of the oppression by the forced labor of the Israelites. The other city was Ramses; and the Septuagint adds a third, \\"On, which is Heliopolis.\\" These cities are called by a Hebrew term rendered in the Authorized Version \\"treasure cities\\" and in the Revised Version \\"store cities.\\" The Septuagint renders it \\"strong [or \\"fortified\\"] cities.\\" The same term is used of certain cities of King Solomon in I Kings 9:19 (comp. also II Chronicles 16:4). Graeco-Roman Hero√∂polis Hero√∂polis was a large city east of the Nile Delta, situated near the mouth of the Royal Canal which connected the Nile with the Red Sea. Although not immediately upon the coast, but nearly due north of the Bitter Lakes, Hero√∂polis was of sufficient importance, as a trading station, to confer its name upon the arm of the Red Sea, Ptol. v. 17. ¬ß 1, Latin: Heroopoliticus Sinus which runs up the Egyptian mainland as far as Arsino√´ (near modern Suez) -- the modern Gulf of Suez.Theophrast. Hist. Plant. iii. 8. It was the capital of the 8th nome of Lower Egypt. Location Early on, the location of Pithom‚Äîjust like the locations of other similar sites, such as Tanis‚Äîhad been the subject of much conjecture and debate. The 10th century Jewish scholar, Saadia Gaon, identified the place in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch as Faiyum, southwest of Cairo.Saadia Gaon, Tafsir (Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch), Exodus 1:11; Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Torah (ed. Yosef Qafih), Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1984, p. 63 (Exodus 1:11) (Hebrew) √âdouard Naville and Flinders Petrie were looking for Pithom along the Wadi Tumilat, an arable strip of land serving as the ancient transit route between Egypt and Canaan across the Sinai‚Äîthe biblical 'Way of Shur'.Israel: Ancient Kingdom Or Late Invention? Daniel Isaac Block, ed. B&H; Publishing Group, 2008 In the spring of 1883, Naville believed he had identified Pithom as the archaeological site Tell El Maskhuta. The site of Pithom, as identified by Naville, is at the eastern edge of Wadi Tumilat, south-west of Isma√Ølia. Petrie agreed with this identification. John Holladay, a more recent investigator of the site, also supports this opinion. =Tell El Retaba= Eight miles west from Tell El Maskhuta is the site of Tell El Retabeh. This is approximately the midpoint of Wadi Tumilat. Here was found a group of granite statues representing Ramesses II, two inscriptions naming Pr-Itm (Temple of Atum), storehouses and bricks made without straw. So archeologists (wrongly) concluded that this was the site of Pi-Ramesses. The excavations carried on by Naville for the Egypt Exploration Fund uncovered a city wall, a ruined temple, and the remains of a series of brick buildings with very thick walls and consisting of rectangular chambers of various sizes, opening only at the top and without any entrances to one another. Some scholars, such as Manfred Bietak and Kenneth Kitchen, have argued that this was the ancient Pithom.Israel: Ancient Kingdom Or Late Invention? Daniel Isaac Block, ed. B&H; Publishing Group, 2008. p. 113 This opinion goes back to the 19th century, when Alan Gardiner first identified Pithom with the site of Tell El Retaba, and this was later accepted by William F. Albright, BROKEN LINK and Kenneth Kitchen. Yet archeological excavations seem to show that Tell El Retaba had been unoccupied during the period when we find monuments relating to a town called Pithom.Seters, John Van, \\"The Geography of the Exodus\\", in Silberman, Neil Ash (editor), The Land That I Will Show You: Essays in History and Archaeology of the Ancient Near East in Honor of J. Maxwell Miller, Sheffield Academic Press, 1997, P. 261-262, , Naville identified all these locations as being in the region of Tjeku (Sukkot), the 8th Lower Egypt nome. The joint Polish-Slovak expedition has carried out a systematic research at Tell El Retaba since 2007.Aigyptos Foundation Slovak Egyptological team It is conducted with the cooperation of several institutions: Institute of Archaeology University of Warsaw, the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw, the Slovak Academy of Sciences and the Aigyptos Foundation. More recent analyses have demonstrated that the designation for the temple of Atum, pr-itm, can be found in inscriptions at both sites‚Äîboth at Tell El Retaba and at Tell El Maskhuta. This seems to demonstrate that the name 'Pithom' was used originally for the earlier site, Tell El Retaba, before it was abandoned. And when the newer city of Tel El Maskhuta was built, the same name was applied to it as well ‚Äì as the temple of Atum was moved to El Maskhuta. Thus, in effect, 'Pithom' was moved to a new location, which phenomenon is attested with some other cities as well, such as Migdol.James K. Hoffmeier, Ancient Israel in Sinai: The Evidence for the Authenticity of the Wilderness Tradition. Oxford University Press, 2005 =Wadi Tumilat Project= Modern excavations at Tel El Maskhuta were carried out by the University of Toronto 'Wadi Tumilat Project' under the direction of John Holladay. They worked over five seasons between 1978 and 1985. These excavations have shown that the history of Tel El Maskhuta is quite complex. There was a Middle Bronze IIB settlement there (18th-17th centuries BC), associated with the Hyksos, followed by a long break until the late 7th century BC, when there was rebuilding. This construction at the end of the 7th century may have been carried out by Pharaoh Necho II, possibly as part of his uncompleted canal building project from the Nile to the Gulf of Suez.Seters, John Van, \\"The Geography of the Exodus\\", in Silberman, Neil Ash (editor), The Land That I Will Show You: Essays in History and Archaeology of the Ancient Near East in Honor of J.

The classical regions, including Pisidia, and their main settlements. Pisidia (; , Pisid√≠a; ) was a region of ancient Asia Minor located north of Lycia, bordering Caria, Lydia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, and corresponding roughly to the modern-day province of Antalya in Turkey. Among Pisidia's settlements were Antioch(ia) in Pisidia, Termessos, Cremna, Sagalassos, Etenna, Neapolis, Selge, Tyriacum, Laodiceia Katakekaumene and Philomelium.  Geography  Although Pisidia is close to the Mediterranean Sea, the warm climate of the south cannot pass the height of the Taurus Mountains. The climate is too dry for timberland, but crop plants grow in areas provided with water from the mountains, whose annual average rainfall is c. 1000 mm on the peaks and 500 mm on the slopes. This water feeds the plateau. The Pisidian cities, mostly founded on the slopes, benefited from this fertility. The irrigated soil is very suitable for growing fruit and for husbandry.  History  = Early history = The area of Pisidia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age, with some settlements known from historical times ranging in age from the eighth to third millennium BC. The ancestors of the classical Pisidians were likely present in the region before the 14th century BC, when Hittite records refer to a mountain site of Salawassa, identified with the later site of Sagalassos. At that time, Pisidia appears to have been part of the region the Hittites called Arzawa. The Pisidian language is poorly known, but is assumed to be a member of the Anatolian branch of Indo-European languages. There is a lacuna (gap) in the text of Herodotus (7.76), but it is doubtful to surmise a reference to the Pisidians in that passage. There can be little doubt that the Pisidians and Pamphylians were the same people, but a distinction between the two seems to have been established at an early period. Herodotus, who does not mention the Pisidians, enumerates the Pamphylians among the nations of Asia Minor, while Ephorus mentions them both, correctly including the one among the nations on the interior, the other among those of the coast. Pamphylia early received colonies from Greece and other lands, and from this cause, combined with the greater fertility of their territory, became more civilized than its neighbor in the interior. Pisidia remained a wild, mountainous region, and one of the most difficult for outside powers to rule. As far back as the Hittite period, Pisidia was host to independent communities not under the Hittite yoke. Known for its warlike factions, it remained largely independent of the Lydians, and even the Persians, who conquered Anatolia in the 6th century BC, and divided the area into satrapies for greater control, were unable to cope with constant uprisings and turmoil. = Hellenistic period = Alexander the Great had a somewhat better fortune, conquering Sagalassos on his way to Persia, though the city of Termessos defied him. After Alexander died, the region became part of territories of Antigonus Monophthalmus, and possibly Lysimachus of Thrace, after which Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid Dynasty of Syria, took control of Pisidia. Under the Seleucids, Greek colonies were founded at strategically important places and the local people Hellenised. Even so, the Hellenistic kings were never in complete control, in part because Anatolia was contested between the Seleucids, the Attalids of Pergamon, and the Galatians, invading Celts from Europe. The cities in Pisidia were among the last in western Anatolia to fully adopt Greek culture and to coin their own money. Pisidia officially passed from the Seleucids to the Attalids as a result of the Treaty of Apamea, forced on Antiochos III of Syria by the Romans in 188 BC. After Attalos III, the last king of Pergamon, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome in 133 BC as the province of Asia, Pisidia was given to the Kingdom of Cappadocia, which proved unable to govern it. The Pisidians cast their lot with pirate-dominated Cilicia and Pamphylia until the Roman rule was restored in 102 BC. A 15th-century map showing Pisidia In 39 BC Marcus Antonius entrusted Pisidia to the Galatian client king Amyntas and charged him with suppressing a people of the Taurus Mountains known as the Homonadesians, who sometimes controlled the roads connecting Pisidia to Pamphylia. = Roman and Byzantine rule = After king Amyntas of Galatia was killed in the struggle in 25 BC, Rome made Pisidia part of the new province of Galatia. The Homonadesians were finally wiped out in 3 BC. During the Roman period Pisidia was colonized with veterans of its legions to maintain control. For the colonists, who came from poorer parts of Italy, agriculture must have been the area's main attraction. Under Augustus, eight such colonies were established in Pisidia, and Antioch and Sagalassos became the most important cities. The province was gradually Latinised. Latin remained the formal language of the area until the end of the 3rd century. Pisidia became an important early Christian centre. Paul the Apostle preached in Antioch on his first journey. and He also visited the area in his second and third journeys. After the Emperor Constantine's legalization of Christianity in 311, Antioch in Pisidia (which has various namesakes, including the Patriarchate in Syria) played an important role as the Christian metropolitan see as well as being the capital of the civil province of Pisidia. Most Pisidian cities were heavily fortified at that time due to civil wars and foreign invasions. The area was devastated by an earthquake in 518, a plague around 541‚Äì543, and another earthquake and Arab raids in the middle of the 7th century. After the Muslim conquest of Syria disrupted the trade routes, the area declined in importance. In the 8th century the raids increased. In the 11th century the Seljuk Turks captured the area and founded the Seljuk Sultanate in Central Anatolia. Pisidia frequently changed hands between the Byzantine Empire and the Turks until 1176, when Sultan Kƒ±lƒ±√ßarslan defeated Manuel Komnenos in the Battle of Myriocephalon (thousand heads), which ended Byzantine rule and cemented Turkish rule of the area.

For example, to estimate the probability of an aircraft crashing, we could refer to the frequency of crashes among various different sets of aircraft: all aircraft, this make of aircraft, aircraft flown by this company in the last ten years, etc. In this example, the aircraft for which we wish to calculate the probability of a crash is a member of many different classes, in which the frequency of crashes differs. It is not obvious which class we should refer to for this aircraft. In general, any case is a member of very many classes among which the frequency of the attribute of interest differs. The reference class problem discusses which class is the most appropriate to use. More formally, many arguments in statistics take the form of a statistical syllogism: #X proportion of F are G #I is an F #Therefore, the chance that I is a G is X F is called the \\"reference class\\" and G is the \\"attribute class\\" and I is the individual object. How is one to choose an appropriate class F? In Bayesian statistics, the problem arises as that of deciding on a prior probability for the outcome in question (or when considering multiple outcomes, a prior probability distribution). History John Venn stated in 1876 that \\"every single thing or event has an indefinite number of properties or attributes observable in it, and might therefore be considered as belonging to an indefinite number of different classes of things\\", leading to problems with how to assign probabilities to a single case. He used as an example the probability that John Smith, a consumptive Englishman aged fifty, will live to sixty-one.J. Venn,The Logic of Chance (2nd ed, 1876), p. 194. The name \\"problem of the reference class\\" was given by Hans Reichenbach, who wrote, \\"If we are asked to find the probability holding for an individual future event, we must first incorporate the event into a suitable reference class. An individual thing or event may be incorporated in many reference classes, from which different probabilities will result.\\"H. Reichenbach, The Theory of Probability (1949), p. 374 There has also been discussion of the reference class problem in philosophy.A. H√°jek, The Reference Class Problem is Your Problem Too, Synthese 156 (2007): 185-215. Legal applications Applying Bayesian probability in practice involves assessing a prior probability which is then applied to a likelihood function and updated through the use of Bayes' theorem. Suppose we wish to assess the probability of guilt of a defendant in a court case in which DNA (or other probabilistic) evidence is available. We first need to assess the prior probability of guilt of the defendant. We could say that the crime occurred in a city of 1,000,000 people, of whom 15% meet the requirements of being the same sex, age group and approximate description as the perpetrator. That suggests a prior probability of guilt of 1 in 150,000. We could cast the net wider and say that there is, say, a 25% chance that the perpetrator is from out of town, but still from this country, and construct a different prior estimate. We could say that the perpetrator could come from anywhere in the world, and so on. Legal theorists have discussed the reference class problem particularly with reference to the Shonubi case. Charles Shonubi, a Nigerian drug smuggler, was arrested at JFK Airport on Dec 10, 1991, and convicted of heroin importation. The severity of his sentence depended not only on the amount of drugs on that trip, but the total amount of drugs he was estimated to have imported on seven previous occasions on which he was not caught. Five separate legal cases debated how that amount should be estimated. In one case, \\"Shonubi III\\", the prosecution presented statistical evidence of the amount of drugs found on Nigerian drug smugglers caught at JFK Airport in the period between Shonubi's first and last trips. There has been debate over whether that is the (or a) correct reference class to use, and if so, why.M. Colyvan, H.M. Regan and S. Ferson, Is it a crime to belong to a reference class?, Journal of Political Philosophy 9 (2001): 168-181P. Tillers, If wishes were horses: discursive comments on attempts to prevent individuals from being unfairly burdened by their reference classes, Law, Probability and Risk 4 (2005): 33-49. Other legal applications involve valuation. For example, houses might be valued using the data in a database of house sales of \\"similar\\" houses. To decide on which houses are similar to a given one, one needs to know which features of a house are relevant to price. Number of bathrooms might be relevant, but not the eye color of the owner. It has been argued that such reference class problems can be solved by finding which features are relevant: a feature is relevant to house price if house price covaries with it (it affects the likelihood that the house has a higher or lower value), and the ideal reference class for an individual is the set of all instances which share with it all relevant features.J.

Pinerolo (; ; ; ) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Turin, Piedmont, northwestern Italy, southwest of Turin on the river Chisone. The Lemina torrent has its source at the boundary between Pinerolo and San Pietro Val di Lemina. History Archaeological remains found in the center of Pinerolo in the early 1970s testify the human presence in the area in prehistoric times Remains of the Roman necropolis of Dama Rossa, found during works for the Pinerolo-Turin highway in 2003, show that the area at the time was the seat of agricultural activitiesPage at Pinerolo website The toponym of Pinerolo appears only in the Middle Ages, in an imperial diplom dating from 981, by which Otto II confirmed its possession, within the March of Turin, to the Bishops of Turin. The town of Pinerolo was one of the main crossroads in Italy, and was therefore one of the principal fortresses of the dukes of Savoy. Its military importance was the origin of the well-known military school that still exists today. The fortress of Fenestrelle is nearby. Later, Pinerolo was ruled by the abbot nullius of Pinerolo, who ran the abbey of Abbadia Alpina, even after the city had established itself as a municipality (1247) under the government of Thomas II of Savoy. From 1235, Amadeus IV of Savoy exercised over the town a kind of protectorate, which became absolute in 1243, and was continued thereafter by either the House of Savoy, or its cadet-branch, the House of Savoy-Acaia. When French troops invaded Piedmont (1536), Pinerolo was conquered; it remained under French control until 1574. It fell again to France in 1631 with the treaty of Cherasco. France agreed to hand Pinerolo back to the house of Savoy under the Treaty of Turin (1696), with the conditions that its stronghold's fortifications be demolished and that Savoy withdraw from the League of Augsburg against Louis XIV. Economy The economy of the Waldensian Valleys (right slope of Val Chisone, Valle Germanasca and Val Pellice) and of the plain between these valleys and the Po (river) course revolves around Pinerolo. Several industries have their base in this area, particularly mechanical, paper making, chemical and textile industries, and also absorb manpower from the nearby population centers. The leading companies are Freudenberg Sealing Technologies (former Corcos), which produces seals for rotating shafts and valves sterns, Raspini, a meat processing company, TN Italy (former NN Inc.), which manufactures ball bearings, the Trombini Group (ex Annovati), which supplies the furniture industry with chipboard, and PMT Italia, which supplies the pulp and paper industry with paper machines. Moreover, Pinerolo is the trade center of the surrounding mountain area. The agriculture and the breeding of the livestock are conducted with advanced techniques. Pinerolo is the centre of the community called Comunit√† Montana Pinerolese Pedemontano.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 22, 1998. In the episode, Lisa cheats on a test for which she fails to study and receives an A+++ grade, but becomes guilt-ridden. Meanwhile, Homer buys a lobster with the intention of fattening him up to eat. However, he becomes attached to it and decides to keep it as a pet named Pinchy. \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\" was directed by Bob Anderson, and although it was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, neither the main storyline nor the subplot was conceived by him. The main storyline was instead pitched by former staff writer Ron Hauge, while Richard Appel, who also was a staff writer, had pitched the episode's subplot for a long time. The episode satirizes educational establishments, and features a parody of the video game Crash Bandicoot. In its original American broadcast, \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\" was seen by approximately 8 million viewers, and finished in 51st place in ratings the week it aired. Following its broadcast, a scene in the episode garnered criticism from the Catholic League, but the controversy went largely ignored by The Simpsons' staff. The episode received very positive reviews from critics, and is considered one of the best episodes of the season. Plot After a long morning at church, the Simpsons go to the grocery store Eatie Gourmet's to take advantage of free samples in lieu of a Sunday brunch and Bart's suggestion that the family go Catholic so they can have \\"communion wafers and booze\\". At the store, Homer wants to buy a lobster, but since the larger ones are too expensive (eight dollars a pound), he decides to \\"buy an eight dollar lobster, fatten it into an eighty dollar lobster and eat the profits\\". Homer also tries to look for normal flavors of ice cream among the unusually named flavors at the \\"Ken & Harry's\\" factory plant, so he puts Lisa into the freezer to look for some in the back, which ultimately causes her to catch a cold. Although Lisa hates the idea, Marge wants Lisa to stay home from school for the next few days to recover from her cold. Lisa is derisive about playing one of Bart's video games in order to pass the time, but soon becomes addicted to it, and consequently ignores the homework on The Wind in the Willows that she is given by Ralph Wiggum. She even fakes the perpetuation of her illness so that she can continue playing the game. When Marge finally compels her to return to school, Lisa realizes she is unprepared for a test on the book, having not read it. In a panic she visits Bart, who brings her to Nelson, from whom she gets the test answers. Miss Hoover grades the tests over lunch, and Lisa is awarded the rare grade of A+++. Meanwhile, Homer becomes attached to his lobster and names him Pinchy. When the time comes to cook Pinchy, Homer cannot bring himself to do it, and instead declares him a part of the family. The family is extremely proud of Lisa's \\"achievement\\", although she is guilt-ridden at having cheated. The next day at school, Principal Skinner informs Lisa that her test grade has brought Springfield Elementary's GPA up to the state's minimum standard, and they now qualify for a basic assistance grant. Lisa admits that she cheated on the test, but Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers persuade her to keep it a secret so the school can keep the money. During the presentation, Lisa says that she understands how desperately the school needs the basic assistance grant money, but also says that the truth is more important, confessing that she cheated. However, this was anticipated by Skinner, who fooled Lisa by staging a fake presentation before the real one, with the comptroller being revealed as Otto wearing a latex mask, allowing the school to keep the money anyway. Meanwhile, Homer discovers that he has accidentally cooked Pinchy while giving him a hot bath. Later that night, a distraught Homer eats Pinchy and finds him delicious. Production Richard Appel (pictured) pitched the episode's B-story. \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Bob Anderson. Although the episode was written by Maxtone-Graham, neither of the plots were conceived by him. The main plot involving Lisa was pitched by fellow Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, and the sub-plot involving Homer adopting a lobster was conceived by former staff writer Richard Appel. The writers found it difficult to \\"get the subplot go[ing],\\" and it took a long time to come up with the third act, according to Maxtone-Graham.Maxtone-Graham, Ian. (2007). Commentary for \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The writers debated what name Homer would give his lobster. Hauge pitched that his name would be \\"Shelly\\", however they eventually settled on naming him \\"Pinchy\\". Hauge also pitched the name of the grocery store Eatie Gourmet's.Hauge, Ron. (2007). Commentary for \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. At the end of the episode, when Homer is eating Pinchy, a lot of the dialogue was ad-libbed by Dan Castellaneta, who portrays Homer among other characters in the series. It took a long time for the writers to come up with an ending to the episode's main storyline. Eventually, they settled on an ending that parodied the 1973 caper film The Sting. In real life, lobsters are black in color, turning red after being cooked. However, in \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\", Pinchy is red throughout the whole episode. The Dash Dingo video game was difficult to animate, according to Hauge, as the animators had to \\"make it look less than The Simpsons style\\". In order to achieve the desired effect, the animators decided to pixelate the video game.Anderson, Mike B. (2007). Commentary for \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode features the second appearance of Gavin, who first appeared in the season seven episode \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\", and \\"Range Rover Mom\\", Gavin's mother. They were both voiced by Tress MacNeille. The false Comptroller Atkins was portrayed by series regular cast member Harry Shearer, while the real Atkins was voiced by Hank Azaria, who is also a regular cast member for the series.Groening, Matt. (2007). Commentary for \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The name of the character was based on the name of Jacqueline Atkins, a writer's assistant on The Simpsons. The episode also features Marcia Wallace, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor and Karl Wiedergott. The episode satirizes the \\"skewed priorities\\" sometimes associated with educational establishments. Even though Principal Skinner knows that Lisa cheated on her test, he \\"looks the other way\\" so that the school meets the requirements for government funding. In the DVD commentary for the episode, the episodes showrunner Mike Scully opined that \\"there is a lot of truth in this story [...] There are certain requirements that the school has to meet in order to get state funding, and there are things that they'd rather look the other way on if it's gonna cost them money. This does really happen.\\"Scully, Mike. (2007). Commentary for \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. While staying home from school, Lisa plays a video game called Dash Dingo. The video game is a spoof of the 1996 platform video game Crash Bandicoot. In a scene in the episode, Lisa imagines that she will fail the test. She imagines that the president of Harvard University, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, will be disappointed in her and recommend her to Brown University, where Otto was apparently on faculty. The scene was conceived by Maxtone-Graham, whose alma mater was Brown University. He stated that all his friends from Brown and Harvard \\"loved\\" the joke. The liqueur Drambuie is also mentioned in the episode. With the government-funded grant money, Springfield Elementary are able to afford a Coleco, a 1980s home computer. Release and reception =Broadcast and controversy= In its original American broadcast on November 22, 1998, \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\" received an 8.0 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 8 million viewers. The episode finished in 51st place in the ratings for the week of November 16‚Äì22, 1998, tied with the ABC program Sabrina the Teenage Witch. After its original broadcast, the episode garnered scrutiny from The Catholic League, an American Roman Catholic advocacy group. In a scene in the episode, the Simpsons are on their way home from a church service, and Bart says \\"I'm starving. Mom, can we go Catholic so we can get Communion wafers and booze?\\" To which Marge replies \\"No, no one is going Catholic. Three children is enough, thank you.\\" In an issue of the Catholic League's monthly newspaper Catalyst, the organization wrote \\"The Fox animated TV show, The Simpsons, is loved by millions for its engaging characters. It was with regret, therefore, that we were forced to take issue with its November 22 episode [\\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\"].\\" They added that William Anthony Donohue, the current president of the organization, had sent a letter to Fox, reading \\"Can you possibly explain why this dialogue was included in the show?\\" In response, Thomas Chavez, Fox's manager for broadcast standards and practices, wrote a \\"lengthy\\" letter, in part re-printed on the same issue of Catalyst.Pinsky, pp. 131-132 It read: According to Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, the Catholic League was \\"not persuaded\\" by Chavez' letter, and stated that they \\"sarcastically\\" responded in Catalyst: \\"Now why didn't we think of that? Just goes to show how thoughtful the Hollywood gang really is.\\" According to Pinsky, the controversy did not have any impact on the show and was \\"simply ignored\\" by The Simpsons staff.Pinsky, p. 133 =Home release and critical reception= On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone- Graham, Ron Hauge, Yeardley Smith and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode. Following its home video release, \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide described it as \\"A fabulously defining moment in Lisa's life, showing what happens if you let your guard slip.\\" They continued by writing \\"What makes this work even more is the false ending which shows that everyone in Springfield is as adept at predicting Lisa's morality as the viewers are.\\" They concluded their review by calling it \\"An absolutely inspired piece of comedy.\\" Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that he \\"[took] great delight in the way this episode skewers the skewed priorities of the educational establishment.\\" He added that \\"Lisa acts like her usual prissy self, but that factor acts to allow the show to succeed.\\" He concluded by writing that the episode \\"connects to real emotions pretty well and offers some funny moments.\\" Digital Entertainment New's Jake McNeill described it as one of the season's best episodes, giving particular praise to its subplot, which he called \\"great\\". James Plath of DVD Town wrote that \\"the real fun in this episode comes from Homer's attachment to a lobster he brings home.\\" References ;Footnotes ;Bibliography * External links *\\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\" at The Simpsons.com  The Simpsons (season 10) episodes 1998 American television episodes ","title":"Lisa Gets an &quot;A&quot;"},{"id":"1791373","text":"Sonar 2087 is a towed array sonar designed and manufactured by Thales Underwater Systems at sites in the UK (Cheadle Heath in Stockport and Templecombe in Somerset) and in France (Brest).

The band consisted of multi-instrumentalists Denis Ryan, Fergus O'Byrne, and Dermot O'Reilly, all of whom were Irish immigrants to Canada.  History  =1967-1970: Early years = Between the years of 1967-1969, O'Byrne, O'Reilly and Ryan emigrated to Toronto from Ireland in search of \\"better jobs\\". Not initially intent on working professionally as musicians once in Canada, their musical skills and experience, combined with their Irish heritage, provided them opportunities in the vibrant Canadian folk scene. Originally playing only at house parties and gatherings as a means of earning extra money, they quickly found themselves immersed within the Irish folk music scene in Toronto. O'Byrne, O'Reilly and Ryan first played together as members of the Sons of Erin. The original Sons of Erin lineup featured O'Byrne and O'Reilly along with Gary Kavanagh, Mick Crowley, Ben Brooks and bandleader Ralph O'Brien. This lineup first toured Newfoundland in 1969, playing shows in St. John's, Gander, Grand Falls and Labrador over a period of six weeks. Ryan joined the band following the first Newfoundland tour. O'Byrne, O'Reilly and Kavanaugh split from the Sons of Erin and continued touring as O'Reilly's Men. The band was short-lived and O'Reilly soon moved to Montreal. Following O'Reilly's departure, Kavanaugh and O'Byrne joined Don Sullivan and Vik Heaney to form Sullivan's Gypsies. Heaney soon left the group, while O'Reilly rejoined along with Ryan. The band toured in Newfoundland again, as well as playing shows in Manhattan in 1970. =1971: Formation of Ryan's Fancy= Following the disbanding of Sullivan's Gyspsies, O'Byrne, O'Reilly and Ryan formed their own band, Ryan's Fancy. The name was taken from a jig composed by Ryan during their time with Sullivan's Gypsies. Ryan's Fancy played their first show at the Nag's Head pub in Toronto. For the next several months they played gigs in both Toronto and Halifax. In March of 1971, the band made their first trip to Newfoundland, playing a show at the Hotel Newfoundland. =1972-1983: Move to Newfoundland and Critical Success = The trio relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland in 1971 to attend Memorial University of Newfoundland. Making a splash in the local music scene, the group caught the interest of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Produced by Jack Kellum, a television series entitled Ryan's Fancy involved the trio traveling and playing across Atlantic Canada. A second series entitled Tommy Makem and Ryan's Fancy was also produced by CBC in the 1970s. Later, accordion virtuoso James Keane from Dublin became the band's fourth member. Shortly after Keane left the band in 1983, Ryan's Fancy split. Keane moved to New York City, where he became part of the traditional scene there through the 1980s to the present day. =1983-present: Disbanding and current status= When Ryan's Fancy disbanded, Ryan moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, while O'Byrne and O'Reilly remained in St. John's. O'Byrne returned to Newfoundland's Memorial University. In 1988, he became a director of the St. John's Folk Arts Council and between 1990-1991, he chaired the Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival. O'Reilly started a production company called Piperstock Productions in 1993, producing 25 albums. He remained active in music post-Ryan's Fancy, frequently performing live with O'Byrne at gigs in St. John's over the years. His last performance took place the night before he died. He died of a heart attack on 17 February 2007, at age 64. In 2004, Ryan's Fancy were awarded the Dr. Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award of the East Coast Music Association.

() is a 1999 Korean crime-comedy film directed by Kim Sang-jin and written by Park Jung-woo. The film tells the story of a quartet of thugs who rob a gas station out of sheer boredom, having robbed it only a few days previously. Unable to get any money from the register, they take everyone hostage and start dispensing gas and keeping the money. The film becomes progressively more and more farcical as the characters find different ways of amusing themselves, mostly through the mixed cast of characters that come in through the gas station. However, it's only a matter of time before they start upsetting the wrong people. During the question and answer session at a screening during the 2000 Vancouver International Film Festival, director Kim Sang-jin indicated that the film inspired real-life copycats in South Korea. The young cast of then-little known actors would go on to bigger careers: Lee Sung-jae, Yu Oh-seong, Yoo Ji-tae, and Lee Yo-won.  Plot  Having robbed and thoroughly destroyed a gas station, a group of street thugs with their own gripes against society sit in a convenience store and out of sheer boredom, decide to rob the same gas station (as the title card reads, \\"Why do they attack the gas station? Just because!\\"). But, since the manager had the foresight and sense to stash the money away, the four gang members take the manager and the employees hostage and stick around, dispensing gas to all the customers and keeping the money. A range of characters stop for gas throughout the film, not all with good intentions, but with ludicrous results. A gang of school bullies come by the gas station to harass one of the employees for money (they end up being taken hostages, while the bullied employee ends up being forced into a fist fight with one of the bullies... and wins) The police come by demanding free gasoline (the four thugs refuse, as the police clearly aren't doing their job). A customer refuses to pay for a full tank of gas, only asking for half a tank, and is taken hostage. More school bullies come by the gas station, seeking revenge for the first fight, but then they too are taken hostage. The four titular thugs also order unusually large amounts of food from a Chinese restaurant, and the deliveryman becomes suspicious. It's not long until they start attracting the wrong kind of attention, which leads to a violent confrontation with the police and further gang members. The fight ends when No Mark sprays everyone in the chaos with gasoline and threatens to throw a lighter at them. The four thugs escape while everyone else remains panicked at the gas station. During the credits, four scenes show what the characters do after the events in the film: Paint appears to be a successful painter, but he angers a customer when he celebrates by spilling red paint all over one of the paintings. Rockstar restarts his career as a lead singer, and he bosses his members as they prepare for their next performance. Bulldozer becomes a policeman, and he scolds teenagers for smoking. He punishes the kids the same way he dealt with the hostages, and warns them about their futures by alluding to his own past. No Mark joins a baseball team, but accidentally hits the catcher while pitching.  Cast and characters  * Lee Sung-jae - No Mark: The leader of the group. He was an aspiring baseball player, but as an orphan, he didn't have the same opportunities as everyone else. * Yu Oh-seong - Mu Dae-po (also known as Bulldozer or Mad Dog): The enforcer who carries around a really big stick. He has a big problem with authority, as his run-ins have led to his punishment, regardless of how good his intentions were. * Kang Sung-jin - Ddan Dda-ra (Rockstar): The resident musician. Was a member of a rock band, but was forced out because of a few bad business decisions with the wrong people. * Yoo Ji-tae - Paint: Was once an aspiring artist, although his father wouldn't have anything to do with it. * Park Yeong-gyu - Gas station owner * Jung Joon - Geon-bbang, a crew of the gas station * Lee Yo-won - Ggal-chi, a crew of the gas station * Lee Jeong-ho - Meek man * Kim Su-ro - a delivery man * Lee Won- jong - a policeman * Jeong So-yeong * Yoo Hae-jin - Yonggari, one of the gang leaders * Lee Jong-hyuk - a member of Yonggari's gang  Social commentary  Attack the Gas Station was released around a time of economic turmoil in South Korea in the mid-to-late 1990s called the \\"IMF crisis,\\" culminating with many Korean car manufacturers laying off thousands of employees. There are many allusions to this throughout the film, mostly when Paint discovers framed pieces of paper with slogans promoting a productive work force (which he subsequently destroys in a fit of rage). The film also makes a comment on American economic imperialism during a scene where Ddan Dda-Ra drinks from a can of Pepsi and a police officer chides him for his choice, chastising him for \\"giving money to the Yankees.\\" The young punk defends his choice, saying that Pepsi is a Korean product, referring to the Pepsi logo's resemblance of the Taeguk symbol on the South Korean flag.

Pentaceratops fossils were first discovered in 1921. The genus was named in 1923 when its type species Pentaceratops sternbergii was described. Pentaceratops lived around 76‚Äì73 million years ago, its remains having been mostly found in the Kirtland Formation in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. About a dozen skulls and skeletons have been uncovered, so anatomical understanding of Pentaceratops is fairly complete. One exceptionally large specimen later became its own genus, Titanoceratops, due to its more derived morphology, similarities to Triceratops, and lack of unique characteristics shared with Pentaceratops. Pentaceratops was about 6 meters (20 feet) long, and has been estimated to have weighed around five tonnes. It had a short nose horn, two long brow horns, and long horns on the jugal bones. Its skull had a very long frill with triangular hornlets on the edge. Discoveries and species P. sternbergii holotype skull with reconstructed parts, AMNH The first specimens were collected by Charles Hazelius Sternberg in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. Sternberg worked in commission for the Swedish Uppsala University. In 1921 he recovered a skull and a rump, specimens PMU R.200 and PMU R.286, at the Meyers Creek near the Kimbetoh Wash in a layer of the Kirtland Formation. He sent these fossils to paleontologist Carl Wiman. In 1922 Sternberg decided to work independently and began a dig north of Tsaya Trading Post, in the Fossil Forest of San Juan County. Here he discovered a complete skeleton, which he sold to the American Museum of Natural History. The museum then sent out a team headed by Charles Mook and Peter Kaisen to assist Sternberg in securing this specimen; subsequent digging by Sternberg in 1923 brought the total of AMNH specimens to four. The rump of the main specimen was discarded by the museum because it had insufficient value as a display. The species was named and described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1923, as Pentaceratops sternbergii. The generic name means \\"five-horned face\\", derived from the Greek penta (œÄŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±, meaning five), keras (Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ, horn) and -ops (·Ω§œà, face), in reference to its two long epijugal bones, spikes which protrude out sidewards from under its eyes, in addition to the three more obvious horns as with Triceratops. Osborn obligingly gave it the specific name sternbergii to honor its discoverer.H.F. Osborn, 1923, \\"A new genus and species of Ceratopsia from New Mexico, Pentaceratops sternbergii, American Museum Novitates 93: 1-3 The name had been suggested to Osborn by William Diller Matthew; the specific epithet served as a consolation to the almost bankrupt Sternberg whose 1923 fossils were initially not acquired by the museum that had to use its 1923/1924 budget to process the finds of the great Asian expeditions by Roy Chapman Andrews.Sullivan, R.M. and S.G. Lucas, 2011, \\"Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his San Juan Basin Cretaceous dinosaur collections: Correspondence and photographs (1920-1925)\\", New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 53: 429-471 The holotype was the skull discovered by Sternberg in 1922, specimen AMNH 6325. It was found in a layer of the Fruitland Formation, dating from the Campanian, about seventy-five million years old. The other three AMNH specimens were AMNH 1624, a smaller skull; AMNH 1622, a pair of brow horns; and AMNH 1625, a piece of skull frill. Skull in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science In 1930, Wiman named a second species of Pentaceratops: P. fenestratus. It was based on Sternberg's 1921 specimens and the specific name referred to a hole in the left squamosal.C. Wiman, 1930, \\"√úber Ceratopsia aus der Oberen Kreide in New Mexico\\", Nova Acta Regiae Societatis Scientiarum Upsaliensis, Series 4 7(2): 1-19 This was later considered to be the same species as Pentaceratops sternbergii and thus a junior synonym, the hole being the likely effect of an injury. In 1929 Steinberg's son, George Fryer Sternberg, discovered specimen USNM V12002, a right squamosal. Pentaceratops proved to be a quite common fossil in the Fruitland and Kirtland formations. It has even been used as a guide fossil: the appearance of Pentaceratops sternbergii in the fossil record marks the end of the Judithian land vertebrate age and the start of the Kirtlandian. Subsequent finds include specimens MNA Pl. 1668, MNA Pl. 1747, NMMNH P-27468 and USNM 2416, partial skeletons with skull; YPM 1229, a skeleton lacking the skull; UALP 13342 and UKVP 16100, skulls; UNM B-1701, USNM 12741, USNM 12743, USNM 8604, SMP VP-1596, SMP VP-1488, SMP VP-1500 and SMP VP-1712, fragmentary skulls. Apart from the San Juan Basin finds, a juvenile specimen of Pentaceratops, SDMNH 43470, was found in the Williams Fork Formation of Colorado in 2006. Specimen being airlifted with help from the New Mexico National Guard, 2015 Sometimes the identification of a specimen as Pentaceratops has proven to be highly contentious. In 1998 Thomas Lehman described OMNH 10165, a very large skull and its associated skeleton found in New Mexico in 1941. The skull is presently on display at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, and is the largest Pentaceratops exemplar known, with the distinction of having produced the largest known skull of any land vertebrate.Lehman, T.M., 1998, \\"A gigantic skull and skeleton of the horned dinosaur Pentaceratops sternbergi from New Mexico: Journal of Paleontology, 72(5): 894-906 However, in 2011, the skeleton was renamed as a separate genus, Titanoceratops, due to its more derived morphology, similarities to Triceratops, and lack of unique characteristics shared with Pentaceratops. In 2014 Nicholas Longrich named a new species: Pentaceratops aquilonius, \\"the northern one,\\" based on fragmentary fossils discovered during the 1930s near Manyberries in Canada. The species has been described as having a first epiparietal pointing upwards instead of forwards.Longrich, N., 2014, \\"The horned dinosaurs Pentaceratops and Kosmoceratops from the upper Campanian of Alberta and implications for dinosaur biogeography\\", Cretaceous Research, 51: 292-308 In 2016, Mallon et al. found P. aquilonius to be morphologically similar to Spiclypeus shipporum, with it possibly being the same species, and considered P. aquilonius a nomen dubium. Description Restoration of P. sternbergii Pentaceratops was a large ceratopsid; Dodson estimated the body length at 6 meters. The skull length of AMNH 1624 is 2.3 meters while PMU R.200 has a length of 2.16 meters. In 2016 Paul estimated its length at 5.5 meters (18 ft) and its weight at 2.5 tonnes (2.75 short tons). The nose horn of Pentaceratops is small and pointing upwards and backwards. The brow horns are very long and curving strongly forwards. The somewhat upward tilted frill of Pentaceratops is considerably longer than that of Triceratops, with two large holes (parietal fenestrae) in it. It is rectangular, adorned by large triangular osteoderms: up to twelve episquamosals at the squamosal and three epiparietals at the parietal bone. These are largest at the rear corners of the frill, and are separated by a large U-shaped notch at the midline, a feature not recognized until 1981 when specimen UKVP 16100 was described.Rowe, T., Colbert, E.H. and Nations, J.D., 1981, \\"The occurrence of Pentaceratops with a description of its frill\\", In: Lucas, S.G., Rigby, J.K. and Kues, B.S.

The very thick jugal and the squamosal do not touch each other, a possible autapomorphy. The torso of Pentaceratops is tall and wide. The rear dorsal vertebrae bear long spines from which ligaments possibly ran to the front, to balance the high frill. The prepubis is long. The ischium is long and strongly curves forward. In smaller specimens the thigh bone bows outwards.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 272 Classification Osborn originally assigned Pentaceratops to Ceratopsia. Within this group Pentaceratops belonged to the Ceratopsinae or Chasmosaurinae. It appears to be most closely related to Utahceratops. Their clade was perhaps more derived than the earlier genus Chasmosaurus but more basal than Anchiceratops, the latter representing a line of which Triceratops was a member, which lived a few million years later, right at the end of the Cretaceous period, when all ceratopsians died out. The cladogram of the phylogeny of Pentaceratops according to a study by Scott Sampson et al. in 2010 found that the genus was most closely related to Utahceratops, from a similar age and region. The below cladogram follows Longrich (2014), who named a new species of Pentaceratops, and included nearly all chasmosaurine species. Paratype of P. aquilonius (CMN 9813), interpreted as an epiparietal of P. aquilonius (left) or Spiclypeus Size of P. sternbergi compared to a human Longrich stated that the holotype and referred specimen of P. aquilonius fall within the diagnosis of Pentaceratops, and were recovered very close to the type species in the phylogeny. He noted that the placement of Utahceratops does not make the genus paraphyletic, as there is no requirement that genera are monophyletic. The Williams Fork chasmosaur differs from the Pentaceratops and Utahceratops species, and might require a new specific or generic name. Palaeobiology Pentaceratops, like all ceratopsians, was an herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\" and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the branches which were then shredded - leaves, needles and all - by the tooth batteries, providing a self-sharpening continuous cutting edge in both upper and lower jaws. Ultimately the plant material was digested by the large gut. Palaeoecology Pentaceratops lived around 76‚Äì73 million years ago, its remains having been mostly found in the Kirtland Formation in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. Other dinosaurs that shared its habitat include Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus, the pachycephalosaur Sphaerotholus, the armored dinosaur Nodocephalosaurus and the tyrannosauroid Bistahieversor.

A key figure in Pakistan Movement, widely remembered for presenting Pakistan Resolution, he played major political roles in British India and later in Pakistan (including East Pakistan, today's Bangladesh) and held various other political offices. A. K. Fazlul Huq was first elected to the Bengal Legislative Council from Dhaka in 1913; and served on the council for 21 years until 1934. He was a member of the Central Legislative Assembly for 2 years, between 1934 and 1936. For 10 years between 1937 and 1947, he was an elected member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly, where he was Prime Minister and Leader of the House for 6 years. He was later elected to the East Bengal Legislative Assembly, where he was Chief Minister for 2 months; and to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, where he was Home Minister for 1 year, in the 1950s. Huq boycotted titles and knighthood granted by the British government. He was notable for his English oratory during speeches to the Bengali legislature. Huq courted the votes of the Bengali middle classes and rural communities. He pushed for land reform and curbing the influence of zamindars. Huq was considered a leftist and social democrat on the political spectrum. His ministries were marked by intense factional infighting. In 1940, Huq had one of his most notable political achievements when he presented the Lahore Resolution. During the Second World War, Huq joined the Viceroy of India's defence council and supported Allied war efforts. Under pressure from the Governor of Bengal during the Quit India movement and after the withdrawal of the Hindu Mahasabha from his cabinet, Huq resigned from the post of premier in March 1943. In the Dominion of Pakistan, Huq worked for five years as East Bengal's attorney general and participated in the Bengali Language Movement. He was elected as chief minister, served as a federal minister and was a provincial governor in the 1950s. Huq became secretary of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League in 1913. In 1929, he founded the All Bengal Tenants Association, which evolved into a political platform, including as a part of the post-partition United Front. Huq held important political offices in the subcontinent, including President of the All India Muslim League (1916-1921), General Secretary of the Indian National Congress (1916-1918), Education Minister of Bengal (1924), Mayor of Calcutta (1935), Prime Minister of Bengal (1937-1943), Advocate General of East Bengal (1947-1952), Chief Minister of East Bengal (1954), Home Minister of Pakistan (1955-1956) and Governor of East Pakistan (1956-1958). Huq was fluent in Bengali, English and Urdu, and had a working knowledge of Arabic and Persian. Huq died in Dacca, East Pakistan on 27 April 1962. He is buried in the Mausoleum of three leaders. Early life and education A. K. Fazlul Huq (Sher-E-Bangla) was born into a middle class Bengali Muslim family in Bakerganj, Barisal, Bangladesh in 1873. He was the son of Muhammad Wazid, a well regarded lawyer of the Barisal Bar, and Sayedunnessa Khatun. His paternal grandfather Kazi Akram Ali was a Mukhtar and a scholar of Arabic and Persian. Initially home schooled, he later attended the Barisal District School, where he passed the FA Examination in 1890. Huq moved to Calcutta for his higher education. He sat for his bachelor's degree exam in 1894, in which he achieved a triple honours in chemistry, mathematics and physics from the Presidency College (now Presidency University). He then obtained a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Calcutta in 1896. He obtained his Bachelor in Law from the University Law College in Calcutta in 1897. Civil servant and lawyer The Calcutta High Court, where Huq practised law for over 40 years From 1908 to 1912, Huq was the Assistant Registrar of Co-operatives. He resigned from public service and opted for public life and law. Being advised by Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, he joined the bar council of the Calcutta High Court and started legal practice. He practised in the Calcutta High Court for 40 years. Legislator Huq joined the All India Muhammadan Education Conference in Dhaka in 1906, which founded the All India Muslim League. After the First Partition of Bengal, Huq attended the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference hosted by Sir Khwaja Salimullah in Dacca, the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The conference led to the formation of the All India Muslim League. The annulment of the partition led to the formation of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, in which Huq became secretary. With the patronage of Sir Salimullah and Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury, he was elected to the Bengal Legislative Council from the Dacca Division in 1913. In 1916, Huq was elected president of the All India Muslim League. Huq was one of those who was instrumental behind formulating the Lucknow Pact of 1916 between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. In 1917 Huq was a Joint Secretary of the Indian National Congress and from 1918-1919 he served as the organization's General Secretary. He was the only person in history to concurrently hold the presidency of the League and the General Secretary's position in the Congress. In 1918, Huq presided over the Delhi Session of the All India Muslim League. In 1919, Huq was chosen as a member of the Punjab Enquiry Committee along with Motilal Nehru, Chittaranjan Das and other prominent leaders set up by the Indian National Congress to investigate the Amritsar massacre. Huq was the president of the Midnapore Session of the Bengal Provincial Conference in 1920. During the Khilafat movement, Huq led the pro-British faction within the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, while his rival Maniruzzaman Islamabadi led the pro-Ottoman faction. Huq also differed with the Congress leadership during its non-cooperation movement. Huq favoured working within the constitutional framework rather than boycotting legislatures and colleges. He later resigned from the Congress. In 1923, Huq served as education minister of Bengal for six months under the dyarchy system. Huq ministries =First Premiership (1937-1941)= The Working Committee of the Lahore Resolution in 1940. Prime Minister Huq is standing beside M. A. Jinnah (third from left on the bottom row) The dyarchy was replaced by provincial autonomy in 1935, with the first general elections held in 1937. Huq transformed the All Bengal Tenants Association into the Krishak Praja Party. During the election campaign period, Huq emerged as a major populist figure of Bengal. His party won 35 seats in the Bengal Legislative Assembly during the 1937 Indian provincial elections. It was the third largest party after the Bengal Congress and Bengal Provincial Muslim League. Huq formed a coalition with the Bengal Provincial Muslim League and independent legislators. He was elected as the Leader of the House and the first Prime Minister of Bengal. Huq's cabinet included Nalini Ranjan Sarkar (finance), Bijoy Prasad Singha Roy (revenue), Maharaja Srish Chandra Nandy (communications and public works), Prasanna Deb Raikut (forest and excise), Mukunda Behari Mallick (cooperative credit and rural indebtedness), Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin (home), Nawab Khwaja Habibullah (agriculture and industry), Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (commerce and labour), Nawab Musharraf Hussain (judicial and legislative), and Syed Nausher Ali (public health and local self- government). In 1940, Huq was selected by Muhammad Ali Jinnah to formally present the Lahore Resolution, which envisaged ‚Äòindependent states‚Äô in the eastern and northwestern parts of India. One of the notable measures taken by Huq included using both administrative and legal measures to relieve the debts of peasants and farmers. He protected the poor agriculturists from the clutches of the usurious creditors by enforcing the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938). He established Debt Settlement Boards in all parts of Bengal. The Money Lenders' Act (1938) and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938) improved the lot of the peasants. The Land Revenue Commission appointed by the Government of Bengal on 5 November 1938 with Sir Francis Floud as Chairman, submitted the final report on 21 March 1940. This was a valuable document relating to the land system of the country. The Tenancy Act of 1885 was amended by the Act of 1938 and thereby all provisions relating to enhancement of rent were suspended for a period of 10 years. It also abolished all kinds of abwab and (imposts) imposed traditionally by the zamindars on raiyats. The raiyats obtained the right to transfer their land without paying any transfer-fee to zamindars. The law reduced the interest rate for arrears of rent from 12.50% to 6.25%. The raiyats also obtained the right to get possession of the (land lost through river erosion which then reappeared) by payment of four years' rent within twenty years of the erosion. Thus several acts enforced during Huq's Premiership helped to lighten some of the peasants' burdens, although Huq could not fully execute his programme of Dal-Bhat placed before the people during his election campaigns. Huq also promoted affirmative action for Bengali Muslims. Huq held the education portfolio in his cabinet. He introduced the Primary Education Bill in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, which was passed into law and made primary education free and compulsory. But there was a storm of protests from the opposition members and the press when Fazlul Huq introduced the Secondary Education Bill in the assembly as it incorporated 'principles of communal division in the field of education' at the secondary stage. Huq was associated with the foundation of many educational institutions in Bengal, including Calcutta's Islamia College and Lady Brabourne College, Wajid Memorial Girls' High School and Chakhar College. Due to intense factional infighting within the Krishak Praja Party, Huq ended up being the lone party member on the cabinet. After 1939, the British Empire grappled with World War II. In 1941, Huq and Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the Prime Minister of the Punjab, joined the Viceroy's National Defence Council. Their move angered Muhammad Ali Jinnah because they had not consulted him, and because it deviated from the Muslim League party line that the structure of the council was unacceptable inasmuch as it did not give the League parity with Congress. On 2 December 1941, Huq resigned and governor's rule was imposed. =Second Premiership (1941-1943)= The second Huq coalition government was formed on 12 December 1941. The coalition was supported by most members in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, except for the Muslim League. Supporters included the secular faction of the Krishak Praja Party led by Shamsuddin Ahmed, the Forward Bloc founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, pro-Bose members of the Bengal Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha led by Syama Prasad Mukherjee. The cabinet included Nawab Bahabur Khwaja Habibullah, Khan Bahadur Abdul Karim, Khan Bahadur Hashem Ali Khan, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Santosh Kumar Bose and Upendranath Barman. A Royal Air Force Hawker Hurricane in Chittagong during the Burma Campaign of World War II Despite Huq enjoying the confidence of most of the assembly, he had tense relations with the Governor of Bengal, John Herbert. The governor favoured the provincial Muslim League leaders and patrons, including Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin, the Leader of the Opposition; and the \\"Calcutta Trio\\" in the assembly, including Mirza Ahmad Ispahani, Khwaja Nooruddin and A. R. Siddiqui. The focal point of the League's campaign against Huq was that he was growing closer to Mukherjee, who was alleged to be working against the political and religious interests of the Muslims. The League appealed to the governor to dismiss the Huq ministry. The fear of a Japanese invasion during the Burma Campaign and the implementation by the military of a 'denial policy' implemented in 1942 caused considerable hardship to the delta region. A devastating cyclone and tidal waves whipped the coastal region on 26 October but relief efforts were hindered due to bureaucratic interference. On 3 August, a number of prisoners were shot in Dhaka jail but no inquiry could be held again due to bureaucratic intervention. Another severe strain on the administration was caused when the Congress launched the Quit India movement on 9 August, which was followed by British political repression. The entire province reverberated with protest. The situation was further complicated when Mukherjee resigned, bitterly complaining about the interference of the governor in the work of the ministry. On 15 March 1943, the Prime Minister disclosed on the floor of the Assembly that on several occasions, under the guise of discretionary authority, the governor disregarded the advice tendered by the ministry and listed those occasions. The governor did not take those allegations kindly, and, largely due to his initiative, no-confidence motions were voted in the assembly on 24 March and 27 March. On both occasions the motions were defeated, although by narrow margins. To enforce his writ, the governor asked Huq to sign a prepared letter of resignation on 28 March 1943 and assigned himself the responsibility of administering the province under the provision of Section 92 of the constitution. A month later a League dominated ministry was commissioned with Nazimuddin as the Prime Minister. Huq's party won much fewer seats during the 1946 Indian provincial elections. Political career in Pakistan Huq called for the creation of the Bangla Academy in 1948 The old high court of East Bengal. Huq was Advocate General of East Bengal from 1947 to 1952. King Saud of Saudi Arabia sent his plane to bring Huq to a meeting. Huq's short lived cabinet in East Bengal, which included Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (standing beside Huq; 2nd from left on bottom row) =Advocate General and Language Movement= After the partition of British India, Huq settled in Dhaka and became the Advocate General of the Government of East Bengal. He served in the position between 1947 and 1952. On 31 December 1948, while delivering a presidential address at a literary conference, Huq proposed a language academy for the Bengali language.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Academy He supported the Bengali Language Movement in 1952. Huq was also injured during police action against demonstrators demanding that Bengali be made a state language of Pakistan. =Chief ministership= Huq was a leading figure in the United Front (East Pakistan) coalition along with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Maulana Bhashani. The United Front won a landslide victory during the 1954 East Bengali legislative election. Huq himself defeated his arch rival Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin in the Patuakhali constituency. Huq became chief minister for two months. During his short lived ministry, he took measures to establish the Bangla Academy. King Saud of Saudi Arabia sent a plane to Dhaka to bring Huq for a meeting with the monarch in Karachi. A report in The New York Times stated that Huq wanted independence for East Bengal, which trigged his dismissal and the imposition of Governor General's rule. Huq was subsequently placed under house arrest. =Central ministership= In August 1955, a coalition between the Krishak Sramik Party in East Pakistan and the Muslim League in West Pakistan allowed Chaudhry Mohammad Ali to become Prime Minister and A. K. Fazlul Huq to become the federal Home Minister. Prime Minister Ali was later dismissed by President Iskander Mirza, who allowed a coalition of the Awami League and Republican Party to form government. As a result, the Krishak Sramik Party and the Muslim League formed the main opposition. =Governorship= Huq was appointed Governor of East Pakistan in 1956. He served in the position for two years until the 1958 Pakistani coup d'√©tat. Huq was again placed under house arrest after the coup. Notable quotations =Quotes by Huq= Jawaharlal Nehru was Huq's political secretary between 1918 and 1919 \\"When the tiger arrives, the lamb must give away\\" - Muhammad Ali Jinnah on Huq =Quotes about Huq= Personal life He was married three times. His first wife was Khurshid Begum with whom he had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. His second wife was Musammat Jannatunissa Begum who was from Howrah, West Bengal. They had no children. His third wife Khadija was from Meerut district, Uttar Pradesh. They had a son together, A. K. Faezul Huq, who played an active role in Bangladeshi politics. Legacy Sher-e- Bangla Nagar, which houses the Parliament of Bangladesh, is named in honour of Huq Sher-e-Bangla founded several educational and technical institutions for Bengali Muslims, including Islamia College in Calcutta, Baker Hostel and Carmichael hostel residence halls for Muslim students of the University of Calcutta, Lady Brabourne College, Adina Fazlul Huq College in Rajshahi, Eliot hostel, Tyler Hostel, Medical College hostel, Engineering College hostel, Muslim Institute Building, Dhaka Eden Girls' College Building, Fazlul Huq College at Chakhar, Fazlul Huq Muslim Hall (Dhaka University), Fazlul Huq Hall(Bangladesh Agricultural University, then East Pakistan Agricultural University), Sher-e-Bangla Hall (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology) Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU) Dhaka-1207, Bulbul Music Academy and Central Women's College. Sher-e-Bangla had significant contribution in founding the leading university of Bangladesh: Dhaka University. During his premiership Bangla Academy was founded and Bengali New Year's Day (Pohela Boishakh) was declared a public holiday. Throughout Bangladesh, educational institutions (e.g., Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College), roads, neighbourhoods (Sher-e-Bangla Nagor), and stadiums (Sher-e- Bangla Mirpur Stadium) have been named after him. This depicts the respect of the people for Sher-e-Bangla. One of the main roads in Islamabad, Pakistan A.K. Fazal-ul-Haq Road is named after him. A. K.

Byrd, to have made the first flight to the North Pole in May 1926. However, their claim to have reached the pole is disputed.Richard Sale and Madeleine Lewis, Explorers, Smithsonian, 2005, page 34 Biography Bennett was born in Warrensburg, New York, in 1890. He was an automobile mechanic before he enlisted in the Navy in 1917, during World War I. Bennett attended flight school, learned to fly and was rated as an Aviation Pilot. Bennett served with Richard E. Byrd on an aviation survey of Greenland in 1925, on which Byrd came to respect his ability as a pilot. =North Pole flight= Byrd named Bennett as his pilot for an attempt to reach the North Pole by air in 1926. The expedition was financed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Edsel Ford, Vincent Astor and T. F. Ryan.New York Times. March 1, 1926. Bennett was at the controls on May 9 as the two men made their attempt, in a Fokker tri-motor called the Josephine Ford. They returned to their airfield in Spitzbergen on that day. During the flight, the aircraft's engine developed an oil leak. Bennett advised turning back but Byrd decided to continue the flight.New York Times. May 10, 1926. Although members of the European press were skeptical of their claim (because it seemed that the plane had been away from Spitzbergen too briefly to have reached the North Pole), Byrd and Bennett were lionized as heroes in America. Both Bennett and Byrd received the Medal of Honor, as well as the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for this feat. Upon their arrival in the United States, Byrd was awarded the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society and Bennett was awarded a gold medal from the society in recognition of their achievement. The subsequent discovery of Byrd's diary of the flight, with erased (but still legible) sextant readings, has been considered as evidence they might not have reached the North Pole. =Post North Pole flight= After returning to the United States, Bennett flew the Josephine Ford on a goodwill tour of America, with Bernt Balchen as his co-pilot. Later in his life Balchen claimed that Bennett confessed to him that he and Byrd did not reach the North Pole but, instead, flew around in circles. Balchen would go on to pilot Byrd to the South Pole in 1929, became a highly decorated Army Air Forces officer during the Second World War and retired from the United States Air Force as a colonel. Byrd and his team had been leading candidates to win the large Orteig Prize in 1927, to be awarded for the first nonstop flight between France and the United States. Once again, Byrd named Bennett as his pilot for the attempt. However, Bennett was seriously injured during a practice flight and the airplane, a Fokker F-VIIb-3m named America, was badly damaged when it crashed on take-off. Byrd and his fellow pilot George O. Noville were also slightly injured in the crash. Following this failure by Bennett and Byrd, Charles Lindbergh won the Orteig Prize, flying from Long Island, New York, nonstop to Paris, France. =Bremen Flyers= The Ford Trimotor used in the Bremen Rescue The Bremen was a German aircraft which had just completed the first successful transatlantic aeroplane flight from east to west, but was stranded in Greenly Island, Canada at the end of that non-stop flight from Europe. Floyd Bennett and Bernt Balchen flew a Ford Trimotor to provide relief to the three stranded Bremen Flyers. Bennett had developed pneumonia following a previous crash, and died with a high fever while in flight on April 25, 1928. Balchen flew the remaining eight hours, and he was paid $10,000 ($ today) for the effort, an amount that was passed to Bennett's widow. Bennett's remains were buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Honors Grave at Arlington National Cemetery Bennett and Byrd became national heroes upon their return from the Arctic when they arrived in New York on June 22, 1926. They received numerous honors from both governments and private organizations. Congress voted to award both men the Medal of Honor by a special act passed on December 21, 1926.New York Times. December 22, 1926. The medals were presented to Byrd and Bennett at the White House by President Coolidge on February 25, 1927.New York Times. February 25, 1927. Shortly after his return to the United States, Bennett was promoted from Chief Aviation Pilot to the warrant officer rank of Machinist.

His name is inseparably connected with Mary, Queen of Scots, for whom he conceived an insane passion. From the service of the Constable Montmorency, Chastelard, then a page, passed to the household of Marshal Damville, whom he accompanied in his journey to Scotland in escort of Mary (1561). He returned to Paris in the marshal's train, but left for Scotland again shortly afterwards, bearing letters of recommendation to Mary from his old protector, Montmorency, and the Regrets addressed to the Queen Dowager of France by Pierre de Ronsard, his master in the art of song. He undertook to transmit to the poet the service of plate with which Mary rewarded him. But he had fallen in love with the queen, who is said to have encouraged his passion. Copies of verse passed between them; she lost no occasion of showing herself partial to his person and conversation. The young man hid himself under her bed, where he was discovered by her maids of honour. Mary pardoned the offence, and the old familiar terms between them were resumed. Chastelard was so rash as again to violate her privacy. He was discovered a second time, seized, sentenced and beheaded the next morning. He met his fate valiantly and consistently, reading, on his way to the scaffold, his master's noble ', and turning at the instant of doom towards the palace of Holyrood, to address to his unseen mistress the famous farewell \\"\\" (\\"farewell to you, so beautiful and so cruel, who kill me and whom I cannot cease to love\\"). This at least is the version of the Memoirs of Brant√¥me, who is, however, notoriously untrustworthy. But for his madness of love, it is possible that Chastelard would have left no shadow or shred of himself behind. As it is, his life and death are of interest as illustrating the wild days in which his lot was cast. Randolph's account The English diplomat Thomas Randolph described the arrest of Chastelard in his letters to William Cecil. He notes Chastelard as a servant of Monsieur D'Anville. When he arrived in Scotland in November 1561, Mary showed him her favour by letting him ride a horse that was a present from her half-brother Lord Robert Stewart. He gave her a book of his own poems. On 14 February 1563, St Valentine's day, Chastelard was discovered in the Queen's chamber under her Great Bed at Rossend Castle at Burntisland. Mary ordered her half brother the Earl of Moray to execute him on the spot. But instead the unfortunate poet was taken to St Andrews. Randolph wrote that Chastelard had made a similar attempt at Holyroodhouse. In his defence, Chastelard claimed he had been caught in the Queen's privy but witnesses insisted he was under the bed. He was beheaded a week later at the Market Cross of St Andrews on market day.

Sex.com  According to court documents, Cohen fraudulently obtained the lucrative Internet domain name Sex.com in May 1995 from the original registrant, Gary Kremen, who had registered it in May 1994. Cohen obtained the domain by means of a forged letter to domain registrar Network Solutions, faxed from Kremen's company \\"Online Classified\\", fraudulently stating that Kremen had been dismissed and the firm was abandoning the domain and that Cohen could have it. Network Solutions blindly accepted the fax with no verification and transferred the domain to Cohen, an action that would prove grounds for a later civil suit by Kremen against Network Solutions.Kremen v.

The temple has been partially closed to indoor activities since 2013, awaiting necessary renovations to comply with Montgomery County's Building Use and Occupancy Code. The prayer room, which is separate from the main building, remains open and houses all teachings and activities, and the prayer vigil remains undaunted. The organization raised $1 million for the building of the new temple as of February 18, 2019. The temple built a 36' stupa in 1988 which was consecrated by H.H. Penor Rinpoche during the Rinchen Terzod. A circle of eight small stupas encircling an 18' stupa were built in 1991 and consecrated by Khenchen Tsewang Gyatso. H.H. Penor Rinpoche gave Jetsunma a relic from Tulku Migyur Dorje to be housed in the Migyur Dorje Stupa, which was built and consecrated in 1996. In 1996, in addition to the temple, prayer vigil, teachings and stupas, Jetsunma's vision for Kunzang Palyul Choling included a place for pilgrimage with a hospice, school for children, a monastery and an institute for higher education in the Buddha's teachings.Mackenzie, pg 87 The school, called Pema Choling, ran from 1992 to 1997, and the Migyur Dorje Institute continued from 1996 through 2001.

It relocated later that year to the newly purchased World Prayer Center (now Kunzang Palyul Choling). Students engage in traditional Buddhist practices in the Nyingma tradition. In addition for the ongoing prayers for peace, members and individuals not associated with KPC request prayers be dedicated to loved ones, pets, the recently deceased, or those hit by natural disasters. Occasionally Jetsunma asks that the vigil be dedicated to specific situations. For example, the members dedicated eight months of prayer for Asia Claus, a three-year-old daughter of temple members who was suffering from her second bout of cancer. The effort concluded when doctors could find no trace of the cancer, sparking renewed media attention.Hansen, Nate. \\"All she wants for Christmas is life\\" Red Rock News, December 16, 2005Hansen, Nate. \\"'Pilar' of life, Asia Claus recovers from cancer\\" Red Rock News, June 2, 2006 The Maryland vigil continues unbroken to the present day.Hirsch, Arthur. \\"World unrest fuels Buddhist vigil\\" Baltimore Sun, June 21, 2004 A simultaneous 24-hour Prayer Vigil was conducted by KPC students in Sedona, AZ from October 31, 1999 to August 31, 2008. = Stupa construction = Like many Buddhist Lamas, Jetsunma has long extolled the benefits of building stupas, Buddhist reliquaries said to represent the mind of enlightenment in architectural form.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 11, 31, 66-7 Her students built one of the first large stupas in America, the 36‚Äô Enlightenment Stupa, as an offering to Penor Rinpoche on the occasion of his conferral of the Rinchen Terdzod empowerments in 1988.

The most recent is the Amitabha Stupa in Sedona, Arizona, completed and consecrated in 2004.Ganzer, Tony. A piece of \\"Spiritual Technology\\", May 24, 2007 = Rinchen Terdzod ceremony = From June to September 1988, Penor Rinpoche was in residence at KPC in Poolesville to transmit all of the teachings contained in the Rinchen Terdzod (\\"Treasury of Precious Termas\\"), Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye‚Äôs massive 19th- century compilation of all of the extant revelations of Guru Padmasambhava‚Äôs teaching cycles known as terma. This was the first time that these teachings had ever been conferred in a Western country.,\\"Rinchen Terzod Empowerments,\\" Snow Lion Newsletter, Spring 1988 According to Penor Rinpoche‚Äôs explanation at the time there is a point toward the end of the Rinchen Terdzod transmissions, during the conferral of the Vajrapani empowerment from Rigdzin Godem‚Äôs Jangter (\\"Northern Treasures\\") cycle, where it is customary to perform enthronement of tulkus. Thus, on September 24, 1988, Penor Rinpoche conducted this ceremony for Jetsunma as the tulku of Genyenma Ahkon Lhamo. Jetsunma considers Penor Rinpoche to be her root guru, along with Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of Yeshe Nyingpo based in Ashland, Oregon, who is recognized as an incarnation of the first Ahkon Lhamo's brother, Rigdzin Kunzang Sherab. = Community of monks and nuns = In September, 1988, toward the end of Penor Rinpoche‚Äôs conferral of the Rinchen Terdzod, 25 of Jetsunma's students underwent the traditional ordination ceremony to become monks and nuns, instantly creating one of the largest communities of ordained Westerners in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition in North America.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 66, 142-45, 158-66 Though some have since left their ordination or died, others have joined, and by 2008 the number of KPC's ordained had grown to 40.Pico Iyer, \\"The Price of Faith,\\" Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, Summer 2000 = Mongolian Buddhism Revival Project = Growing out of a friendship with then Mongolian Ambassador Choinkhor and his wife, Jetsunma asked her students in 2004 to create the Mongolian Buddhism Revival Project (MBRP) to help with Mongolia's post-Communist revival of its Buddhist culture, especially the Nyingma lineage. Permanent staff was sent to Mongolia's capital, Ulaanbaatar, in early 2005. In June, 2009, at Jetsunma's direction, staff was removed from Mongolia. = Migyur Dorje Institute = From 1996 to 2001, Jetsunma hosted the Migyur Dorje Institute of Higher Buddhist Studies (MDI). Under this program, taught by Khenchen Tsewang Gyatso, students received complete commentary teachings on classic Buddhist texts by Shantideva, Chandrakirti, Asanga, Ngari Panchen, and Mipham Rinpoche. This curriculum was supplemented by annual 30-day retreats teaching the traditional Nyingmapa sequence of the inner tantra: Ngondro, Tsa Lung, Trekchod, and Togyal. With Penor Rinpoche‚Äôs development of a similar program at the Palyul Retreat Center in McDonough, NY, the MDI program has been discontinued.Sherrill, The Buddha From Brooklyn, pg 336-7 = Animal Rescue and Shelter = Following Hurricane Katrina, in 2005 Zeoli led a group of students to New Orleans to rescue animals left behind. She founded a No Kill animal shelter, Tara's Babies, in order to continue to rescue animals. The target group was dogs on death row, so Tara's Babies mainly rescued dogs from shelters, specializing in fearful and other dogs other shelters rejected.Hudson, Alan R., \\"Rim County Gazette\\", Sept. 9, 2010 Initially caring for 130 dogs, the sanctuary was set in of former ranch land nestled in the three-million acre (12,000 km2) Tonto National Forest near Payson, Arizona. After finding homes for the dogs, closed in 2011 due to volunteer staffing challenges and lack of funding.

The park was, for many centuries, the private hunting ground of Windsor Castle and dates primarily from the mid-13th century. Historically the park covered an area many times the current size known as Windsor Forest, Windsor Royal Park or its current name. The only royal park not managed by The Royal Parks, the park is managed and funded by the Crown Estate. Most parts of the park are open to the public, free of charge, from dawn to dusk, although there is a charge to enter Savill Garden. The park is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Windsor Forest and Great Park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Geography One of many ancient oak trees The Great Park is a gently undulating area of varied landscape. It has sweeping deer lawns, small woods, coverts and areas covered by huge solitary ancient oak trees. There is a small river in the north of the park called the Battle Bourne running to the Thames near Datchet. The River Bourne runs through a number of ponds to the south. Chief amongst these are Great Meadow Pond and Obelisk Pond, near the great lake of Virginia Water. The most prominent hill is Snow Hill and the avenue of trees known as the Long Walk runs between here and Windsor Castle. The area is accessed by a number of gates: Queen Anne's Gate, Ranger's Gate, Cranbourne Gate, Forest Gate, Sandpit Gate, Prince Consort's Gate, Blacknest Gate, Bishop's Gate and Bear's Rails Gate and the original medieval park pale can still be seen in places. The main road known as Sheet Street (A332) into Windsor runs through the northeast of the park. On the western side of the park is The Village, built in the 1930s to house Royal estate workers. It has a village shop and infant/junior school. Other buildings include the Royal Lodge, Cumberland Lodge, the Cranbourne Tower and Norfolk Farm. The park lies mostly within the civil parish of Old Windsor, though the eastern regions are in the Borough of Runnymede and there are small areas in the parishes of Winkfield and Sunninghill. Areas associated with or attached to the Great Park, but not officially within its borders include the Home Park, Mote Park, Flemish Farm, Cranbourne Chase, Forest Lodge and South Forest. Features George III depicted as Roman Emperor in the bronze statue in Windsor Great Park The modern enclosed deer park is at the northern end of the Great Park. It is home to a large herd of semi-wild red deer, reflecting the original medieval purpose of the park. =The Copper Horse= The Long Walk runs south from Windsor Castle to the 1829 Copper Horse statue of King George III atop Snow Hill where there are impressive views of the castle. It is from George IV Gateway at Windsor Castle to The Copper Horse. Other equestrian statues in the park include one of the Prince Consort, to the west of the polo grounds, and one of Queen Elizabeth II near the Village. =The Royal Lodge= The Royal Lodge was built in the centre of the park as the Deputy Ranger's house. It was made into a retreat for the Prince Regent from 1812, but was largely pulled down after his death. The remains were renovated, in the 1930s, as a home for the Duke and Duchess of York before their accession as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It is now the official residence of the Prince Andrew, Duke of York and not accessible by the public. =The Royal Chapel of All Saints= The Royal Chapel of All Saints was built after the chapels of the Royal and Cumberland Lodges proved too small for growing numbers of household staff. The chapel was built in 1825 by Jeffry Wyattville and regularly used by George IV during the refurbishment of Windsor Castle. It was later remodelled in the Gothic Revival style by Samuel Sanders Teulon and Anthony Salvin. Queen Victoria often attended the chapel as did the Duke and Duchess of York before their accession as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It is regularly used by Queen Elizabeth II when she is in residence at Windsor. =Cumberland Lodge= Other notable buildings in the park include Cumberland Lodge, built in 1652 during the Commonwealth. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the Lodge quickly became the home of the Ranger of the Great Park, an office in the gift of the sovereign. Each Ranger made his ‚Äì or in one case, that of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her ‚Äì own mark on the features of the house and its surroundings. Throughout her life Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor. Her daughter Princess Helena of the United Kingdom lived at the Lodge for over fifty years, presiding over elaborate re-building after a major fire in 1869 and extensive alterations in 1912. Lord FitzAlan, last British Viceroy of Ireland, was the last private person to be entrusted with the Lodge. It was in his time, in 1936, that the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, discussed the crisis over King Edward VIII's desire to marry Wallis Simpson, talks which led to his abdication of the crown a few weeks later. In 1947, the King made the Lodge available to the newly established St. Catharine's Foundation, later known as the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Foundation of St Catharine's. Today the organisation is simply known as Cumberland Lodge. Cumberland Lodge today is an educational charity dedicated to initiating fresh debate on questions facing society. The grounds are not generally open to the public, but the house is continually holding conferences, open days and lectures. =Cranbourne Tower= The private Cranbourne Tower is easily viewed from surrounding paths. It is all that survives of Cranbourne Lodge, the residence of the Keeper of Cranbourne Chase. It is thought to date back to the 16th century. The Valley Gardens overlooking Virginia Water Lake =Savill Garden= In the south-east of the park, near Englefield Green, are the well-endowed Savill Garden and Valley Gardens which were designed and built by Eric Savill in the 1930s and 1940s. They include an extraordinary range of flowers and trees from around the world. Smith's Lawn and Polo Grounds are also nearby, as is the tranquil Heather Garden. The Savill Garden Visitor Centre houses a gift shop; toilets; restaurant; coffee shop; ice cream counter; and a shop selling many plants found in the garden. The gardens are open to visitors between 10:00 and 16:30 in the winter and 10:00 and 18:00 in the summer. =Virginia Water Lake= Virginia Water Lake, in the south of the park, is an artificially-created lake of around dating from the 1740s. Among the lakeside features are the high Canadian totem pole, carved by Mungo Martin, Henry Hunt, and Tony Hunt Sr., commemorating the centenary of British Columbia, and a collection of ornamental Roman ruins, transported from the site of Leptis Magna (modern-day Al-Khums) in 1816 and installed at Virginia Water in 1826. The obelisk memorial Beside a smaller lake, known as the Obelisk Pond, is the Obelisk memorial to the Duke of Cumberland. This is inscribed It was originally inscribed \\"Culloden\\" but this was erased on Queen Victoria's orders and replaced with \\"Cumberland\\", inscribed within an inset in the masonry. History Map of the Royal Forests, 1327‚Äì1336 Windsor Castle was begun in the 11th century by William the Conqueror as it afforded a good defensive point over the River Thames. A vast area of Windsor Forest to the south of the castle became reserved by the King for personal hunting and also to supply the castle with wood, deer, boar and fish. It was not until later that it became necessary to formally define this area. In 1129, the first parker was appointed, and in 1240, King Henry III officially set out the borders of the \\"Park\\", a region many times larger than the current Great Park. The castle was a mere fortress at this time and, when hunting, King Henry would have been resident at the more comfortable manor house of Old Windsor (what later became known as Manor Lodge). The title \\"Parker\\" exists today as \\"Ranger of the Park\\", the current title-holder being Prince Philip. Kings Edward I and Edward III used the park for jousts and tournaments and the latter had his Royal stud there to supply horses for the Hundred Years' War. The moat at Bear's Rails contained the manor house of Wychamere, the home of William of Wykeham while he was building the castle. It was later used for bear-baiting. Except for a brief period of privatisation by Oliver Cromwell implying subdivision to pay for the civil war, the area remained the personal property of the monarch until the reign of George III when control over all Crown lands was handed over to Parliament. Today the Park is owned and administered by the Crown Estate, a public body established by Act of Parliament in which the monarch and family members associated with its particular parts have non-executive, advisory roles. =18th century= By the 18th century, the food value of the parkland to Windsor had decreased in importance and the new Hanoverian monarchs preferred to build and garden the land rather than hunt in it. The Long Walk had been laid out by King Charles II and the planting of its trees completed by William of Orange in the 1680s, with double rows of elms which lasted until World War II, but the Georges extended it and built numerous features and monuments, such as the Copper Horse (depicting George III) and the Obelisk (in honour of William, Duke of Cumberland). George III had a set of 2,000-year-old Roman ruins imported from Libya and placed in the park. Virginia Water was begun in 1746 by William, Duke of Cumberland who was then Ranger of the Park. Few details are recorded of the building of the lake; however it has been suggested that prisoners of war from the recent Jacobite risings, who were encamped at the nearby Breakheart hill, were involved. The original lake was much smaller than the current form, and was destroyed in a flood in 1768. In 1780, Paul and Thomas Sandby began construction of a much larger lake at the site, and went on to add an artificial waterfall, Meadow Pond and Obelisk Pond. The lake replaced a small stream of the same name which was probably named after Queen Elizabeth I, who was known as the \\"Virgin Queen\\". =19th and 20th centuries= Queen Elizabeth II and Ronald Reagan riding on horseback in the grounds of Windsor Great Park during President Reagan's 1982 official visit to the United Kingdom. Queen Victoria was probably the greatest patron of the Park. Following the death of her beloved Albert, she largely withdrew from public life, retreating in part to the Park. At adjoining Frogmore she built a Royal Mausoleum for Albert. She was later buried there upon her own death, along with a number of other subsequent members of the royal family. During the 19th and early 20th century, one of the main events for farmers near and far was the Christmas sale of stock from the Royal Windsor Estates. Held on the same week as the Smithfield Show, buyers came from all over the country to buy something from the monarch. The sale in 1850 was held on 17 December by Messrs Buckland & Sons of Windsor, and included Superior Fat Heifers for ¬£20 each; 10 fat ewes, fed by Prince Albert for 33/10; Fine Old Wether Sheep fed by His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch for 40/6. The sale made a total of ¬£226.The History of Buckland & Sons, Edward Barry Bowyer FRICS, (published 1973) On 12 December 1894, Messrs Buckland & Sons were proud to announce: View from Snow Hill > The Prince Consort's Flemish Farm A Xmas sale of fat stock belonging to HM > the Queen ON WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1894 At One o'Clock precisely Carriages > will meet the Trains at both Windsor StationsA history of the Auction, Brian > Learmount, Iver: Barnard & Learmont, 1985, pages 68‚Äì69 The Smith's Lawn area of the Park began to be used for flying in the 1920s, an activity which continued in various forms until the early 1950s. Improvements were made to the grass landing area in the mid 1930s, when it was used by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII). He operated several different types of aircraft from here, including several types of de Havilland airplanes, ranging from Moths to Dragon Rapides. On 29 April 1931, Gordon Olley landed a large (for the time) twin-engine Imperial Airways airliner, the Armstrong Whitworth Argosy (\\"City of Glasgow\\"), at Smith's Lawn.\\"UK Airfields & Airports: A Guide to the history of British flying sites within the United Kingdom: Smith's Lawn.\\" http://www.ukairfieldguide.net/airfields/Smiths-Lawn During World War II, aviation related activities included a factory dispersal site (to minimize the risk of Luftwaffe bombing) for Vickers-Armstrongs, who built and maintained Wellington bombers here. Other wartime aviation activities included use as a Relief Landing Ground for de Havilland Tiger Moth trainers at nearby No. 18 Elementary Flying Training School at Fairoaks.Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust: Smith's Lawn: https://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield- finder/smiths-lawn/ In 2016, the Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a memorial at Smith's Lawn to its use as an airfield. He himself had made his first solo flight from there in 1952, after regular use of the site as an airfield had ceased. BBC. \\"Smith's Lawn airfield memorial unveiled by Duke of Edinburgh.\\" 11 April 2016 https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-36012601 During the World Wars, the Smith's Lawn area of the Park was also used for housing troops. During the 1940s, much of the deer park was ploughed and farmed for food, which involved the felling of hundreds of ancient trees. Over 200 large bombs fell on the land, including several V-2 rockets. During the 1948 Summer Olympics, the park was used as the road cycling venue. In the 1950s, the Park was gradually turned into the recreation area open to the public that it is today. This involved the re-planting of Savill Gardens (which had been allowed to run wild during the war) and the new Valley Gardens. In 1951, a large wall for creeping plants was built at Savill using bricks from bombed-out London buildings. In 1958, a Totem pole was installed nearby, a gift from British Columbia to the Queen. In 1972 Ubi Dwyer organised the \\"People's Free Festival\\", the first of the Windsor Free Festivals in the Park, attended by 700 people. A co-organiser Sid Rawle claimed that Windsor Great Park has been common land until the 18th century, and inclosed (made private) by George III. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was reported to be \\"furious\\". Ubi and his allies repeated the festival in 1973 with at least 1,400 in attendance. In 1973, the Windsor Great Park regulations were introduced. In 1974, 7,000 people turned up but it was violently broken up by police, who made 220 arrests and the festival was banned. Dwyer was jailed the next year for distributing leaflets to promote another festival and Rawle was given three months for reproducing parts of Ubi's leaflets in the underground newspaper International Times.Obituary, Sid Rawle, \\"The Times\\", October 2010 A new visitor centre designed by Glenn Howells Architects and Buro Happold was opened in June 2006, and was nominated for the 2007 Stirling Prize.

Events Every five or six years since 1993 Windsor Great Park has been home to the Scout and Girlguiding camp WINGS (Windsor International Guides and Scouts camp), last held in August 2014. At the 15th World Conference of WAGGGS it was decided to mark the centenary of the birth of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of Guiding, by holding a World Camp with four locations ‚Äî Doe Lake, Ontario, Canada; Quezon City, Philippines; Lac de Conche, Swizerland; and Windsor Great Park, from 19 January to 2 February 1957. Media location Windsor Great Park was featured on the cover and inner booklet of the 1978 Elton John album A Single Man. The Crown Estate has allowed the use of the Park as a filming location and the Great Park has been used on Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Parts 1 and 2), Pirates of the Caribbean, Sir Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, and Snow White and the Huntsman. In 2014 the Park was used as a location for Into the Woods. The King's Speech made extensive use of Cumberland Lodge. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword was on location in the South Forest in early 2015; The Huntsman: Winter's War used various locations during May and June 2015; Bridget Jones's Baby was filming on location on Duke's Lane in October 2015, \\"Flowers\\" from Channel 4 was filming in December 2015 in South Forest & Penslade Bottom, and Windsor Great Park \\"Friends and Members News\\" Summer 2015 edition refers to the filming of the 2016 Warner Bros. film, The Legend of Tarzan, and the 2015 Disney film Cinderella.

It was one of very few collections of Latin liturgical music to survive the Reformation, and hence is an important source. It originally contained music by 24 different composers; however, many of the pieces are damaged or incomplete. It is one of three large choirbooks surviving from early-Tudor England (the others are the Lambeth Choirbook and the Caius Choirbook). The Choirbook was compiled between approximately 1500 and 1505 for use at Eton College; its present binding dates from the mid 16th century. 126 folios remain of the original 224, including the index. In the original, there were a total of 93 separate compositions; however only 64 remain either complete or in part. Some of the 24 composers are known only because of their inclusion in the Eton Choirbook. John Browne has the most compositions (10), followed by Richard Davy (9) and Walter Lambe (8). Stylistically, the music contained in the Eton Choirbook shows three phases in the development of early Renaissance polyphony in England. The first phase is represented by the music of Richard Hygons, William Horwood and Gilbert Banester. Most of the music of this early phase is polyphonic but non- imitative, with contrast achieved by alternation of full five-voice texture with sections sung by fewer voices. The second phase, which includes music by John Browne, Richard Davy and Walter Lambe, uses imitation, cantus firmus techniques, and frequent cross-relations (a feature which was to become a distinctive sound in early Tudor polyphony). The final phase represented in the choirbook includes music by William Cornysh and Robert Fayrfax, composed around 1500. Points of imitation are frequent, cantus firmus techniques disappear, and in general the sound of the music is more Continental. Contents Eton College. All of the compositions in the book are sacred vocal music in Latin. According to the index, it initially contained 93 works. However, part of its content was lost and only 64 works have survived, a few of them incomplete.

The school is under the trusteeship of the Cardinal Hume Academies Trust. Its current Headmaster is Martin Tissot. History Bishop Douglass opened with Voluntary Aided status as a mixed secondary modern Roman Catholic school in Hamilton Road in 1963. In 1969 it merged with the independent Manor House Convent School in the nearby East End Road, which thereafter housed the sixth form of the expanded school. New buildings were added in Hamilton Road in 1969, 1973, 1976 and 1982, when there were 1,140 pupils on the roll. The founding headmaster, Michael Caulfield, was at the time of his appointment the youngest of any school in the UK. He was succeeded by his deputy, John Meadows in the early 1990s, who retired in 2001. After a year with a temporary head and the school was faced with closure, Angela Murphy became the school's first headmistress in 2003. At the time of Murphy's appointment in 2003 the school was under 'special measures'. Since this date standards have consistently improved. Bishop Douglass was taken out of Special Measures following HMI Inspection in December 2005 and in its most recent Ofsted Inspection the following comments were given ‚Äúa Good school of which students, parents, staff and governors are proud of‚Äù OFSTED summary for Bishop Douglass School 2008 In 2007, the School was granted Specialist Science College status, and was renewed in 2010. Under the Academies Act 2010, in 2016, Bishop Douglass became an Academy under the trusteeship of the Cardinal Hume Academies Trust. The school's current Headmaster, former pupil Martin Tissot, is also Headmaster of the other schools in the Trust - St George's Roman Catholic Secondary School in Maida Vale and St Thomas More Catholic School, Wood Green.  Bishop Douglass' Curriculum  The pupils study Religious Education, Mathematics, Science, English Language and Literature, Spanish, French, History, Geography, Music, Art, Physical Education, Drama, Technology, ICT and Citizenship. The pupils carry on their selected GCSE subjects to Key Stage Four where additional subjects such as Sociology, Fine Art, Graphic Design, Business Studies and Computer Science are available. By Key Stage 4, the Science GCSEs are separated into Biology, Chemistry and Physics. At sixth form, pupils choose A level subjects, including many traditional subjects, which they can continue from GCSE, such as Mathematics, Natural Sciences, English Literature and Philosophy as well as new subjects, such as Psychology, Engineering, Theology and Economics. Bishop Douglass' Traditions =School Uniform= From the founding of the school until 1969 the school uniform was light grey and white. When the school merged with Manor House Convent School, the uniform was From the founding of the school until 1969 the school uniform was grey. When the school became a comprehensive, at the time of the merger with Manor House Convent, until 2001, the Bishop Douglass uniform for girls consisted of a long royal blue skirt, grey V-neck jumper and a royal blue blazer. This would be worn with a blouse of the same colour as the house they were in. The girl's uniform blazer was originally collarless and double breasted. In the 1990s, it became a standard jacket similar to the boy's uniform. Originally, a navy bow- tie was worn with the blouse, but this was abandoned around 1974, at around the same time that the summer dress in blue and white dog tooth check was discontinued. Prior to 1977, first year girl students (\\"Discovery Year\\") wore a navy blue \\"gym slip\\" dress with their house blouse, rather than the skirt. The boys' uniform consisted of dark grey trousers, a white shirt, a grey V-neck jumper and royal blue blazer. This would be worn with a blue tie with stripes of the same colour as their house. The Sixth Form uniform for girls was navy skirt and navy sweater with a white blouse and for the boys it was black trousers, black sweater, black jacket and white shirt. The sixth form tie for boys was black, with the school emblem stitched in white.renewed to its current form, defined by its distinctive Royal Blue. It consists of a white shirt, a royal blue v-neck jumper, worn in the winter, and a royal blue blazer, bearing the emblem of the school. Girls wear a Royal Blue and basil green kilt, or may choose dark trousers, which were allowed after 2001. Boys wear dark trousers. All pupils wear a tie of colour corresponding to the colour of their house (see House colours below). Sixth form students wear a dark blazer, dark trousers or skirts (for girls), a white inner shirt and a striped white and black tie. In 2001, a new uniform was implemented, the most noticeable change being in the new girls' uniform: a green Douglass Tartan Kilt, a white shirt, a royal blue blazer and a blue tie with stripes of the same colour as their house. A new option was that the girls were now allowed to wear black trousers instead of the skirt. The boys' uniform remained the same except for a darker shade of blue for their blazers. =School Houses= Before the merger with Manor House Covent there were four houses: Bourne, Godfrey, Griffen and Hindsley. After the merger, a further two were established. Each house is named after a Christian Martyr, canonised by the Roman Catholic Church and has a distinctive colour which pupils of the house wear on their uniform. Each House supports its chosen social causes, ideas and charities. Inter-house competitions, such as poetry, chess, art and sport, take place throughout the academic year. * Campion House's namesake is Saint Edmumd Campion and bears the colour Royal Blue. Campion's work in spreading and supporting the Roman Catholic faith, which lead to his death by capital punishment in Anglican England, is widely championed and he was canonised by Pope Leo XIII in 1886. * Fisher House's namesake is Saint John Fisher and bears the colour Yellow. Fisher's contributions to the faith, academia and society are widely celebrated, eventually being imprisoned for his faith, and he was canonised by Pope Pius XI in 1935. * Line House's namesake is Saint Anne Line and bears the colour pink. Line became a prominent protector and provider of shelter to clandestine Roman Catholic Priests in Anglican England, for which she faced capital punishment under Queen Elizabeth I. She was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970. * More House's namesake is Sir Thomas More and bears the colour orange. More was a statesman and advisor to King Henry VIII who refused to accept the King's separation from the Roman Catholic Church and was thus convicted of treason. He was canonised by Pope Pius XI in 1935. * Owen House's namesake is Saint Nicholas Owen and bears the colour green. Owen was a builder of hiding shelter for Catholic Priests in the 1500s, when Catholics were persecuted in Anglican England, he was duly captured and tortured. He was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970. * Ward House's namesake is Saint Margaret Ward and bears the colour lilac. Ward was martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for her support of the Catholic fath after receiving capital punishment for helping a Priest escape from prison. She was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970. HouseColours: Campion , Fisher , Line , More , Owen , Ward Additionally, there are two houses that do not bear the name of Catholic Saints nor colours: All-Saints and Southwell. These houses were introduced after 2013, primarily for administrative purposes, to allow for the expansion of the sixth form and are only used in the sixth form. In addition to school houses, for many years the form years were named. First year students were classified as \\"Discovery\\" Year students in recognition of their new status in the school. Second year was named \\"Exploration\\"; the third year was \\"Understanding\\"; the fourth year was \\"Preparation\\" - as they prepared for their examination years; and the fifth year was \\"Appreciation\\" - a somewhat arrogant statement that the students were appreciating all the school had done for them. The sixth form was named Lower and Upper Sixth years. The naming convention was abandoned in 2002.

In 2016, it was ranked by The Sunday Times as the 12th best comprehensive school in the country. In its most recent Ofsted inspection, it was rated \\"Outstanding\\" and is the highest-performing comprehensive school in the borough.  History  =Private schools= Tollington Park College, a private educational establishment for boys, was founded by William Brown in 1879 in Tollington Park, London N4. Rapid population growth around Muswell Hill created the need for a new school. Campbell Brown, the founder's son, established Tollington Boys School in Tetherdown, Muswell Hill in 1901. Brown then opened Tollington High School for Girls in nearby Collingwood Avenue in 1910. In 1919 both schools were purchased by the local education authority. Aside from the senior management, the two schools operated independently.School prospectus 1928 =Grammar schools= After World War II, this became a state grammar school and the attached preparatory school became Tetherdown Primary School (this moved from the site in 1958 when it exchanged premises with the girls' grammar school). In 1958 the current building was erected and Tollington High School for Girls and Tollington Grammar School for Boys merged to become Tollington Grammar School (co-ed). In 1955, William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (named after a local councillor) opened on an adjoining site in Creighton Avenue, taking the senior classes from Coldfall Council School. It offered extended classes from 1961. =Creighton Comprehensive School= With the introduction of comprehensive education in Haringey in 1967, Tollington Grammar School and William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School were merged to form Creighton School. Charles Loades, head of William Grimshaw since 1958, became head, remaining until his retirement in 1974.Hunter Davies, The Creighton Report: A Year in the Life of a Comprehensive School (1976), Hamish Hamilton. . In the early 1970s, Creighton School became the centrepiece of a Labour Party educational experiment. Situated in the middle-class, largely white suburb of Muswell Hill it was decided to integrate a large number of Afro-Caribbean and other ethnic minority children into the school from distant parts of the borough in an attempt to maximise education choice and social interaction ‚Äì a policy based heavily on the United States' then-current system of desegregation busing. In 1975, before this new intake had worked through the school, around one-third of the Sixth Form was either a first-generation immigrant, or had a surname of Cypriot or Asian origin. The head who was charged with overseeing this experiment was Molly Hattersley, a leading socialist. As a part of the continuing debate about comprehensive schools, Creighton School became the subject of a series of articles in the Sunday Times and a subsequent book by Hunter Davies, The Creighton Report, illustrated by an A-Level Photography student at the school and the Sunday Times photojournalist Frank Herrmann. =Fortismere School= After further reorganisation, Creighton School and another comprehensive, Alexandra Park School, were combined under the new name of Fortismere School. It opened in September 1983 and gained Technology College status in 1997, which lasted until it became a foundation school. Foundation status In the summer of 2006, the school's governors and recently appointed head teacher Aydin √ñna√ß proposed to change the school's status to that of a foundation school. The governors argued that the increased autonomy from the LEA provided by foundation status would be beneficial to the school, while critics argued that the proposal was an attack on the school's comprehensive nature and would lead to a reduction in provision for pupils with special educational needs. On 1 September 2007, Fortismere became a foundation school ‚Äì despite opposition from 70 per cent of parents and a petition from students demanding to be consulted on the changes. In September 2009, √ñna√ß altered the comprehensive school's entry criteria, reserving places for musically gifted children ‚Äì a policy described as 'elitist', favouring wealthier parents and more academic children. √ñna√ß was also criticised for a policy towards children with special needs. Ten children were affected by the policy, which reduced personnel in what had been a well-staffed special needs department, and breached legal requirements concerning the hours of support provided to children. Parents sought a judicial review of √ñna√ß's approach to special needs provision, but in December 2009 he resigned from his post soon after the legal action started. The action was subsequently discontinued and special needs provision improved after √ñna√ß's departure. Vertical tutoring and colleges Under the leadership of headteacher Helen Glass, Fortismere adopted a vertical tutoring system in September 2012. Under the new system students are sorted into tutor groups that consist of students from Years 7‚Äì11. The school also introduced a college system. Following an online vote, it was decided that the new 'colleges' would be named after the Wonders of the World. There are six 'colleges': Alexandria, Ephesus, Colosseum, Rhodes, Olympia and Petra. Campus The Fortimere site, showing the two main wings, Blanche Neville School and Eden Primary The school occupies extensive grounds a little west of the centre of Muswell Hill. There are two main buildings on the site, the North Wing focuses mainly on English, Modern Languages and the Arts and South Wing which mainly focuses on Maths, Sciences and Humanities with a separate science block. The Wings are separated by playing fields, a sports hall, astroturf and tennis courts. A sixth form building is adjacent to the South Wing, situated just inside the Tetherdown entrance. There are main entrances in Twyford Avenue (South Wing), Tetherdown (South Wing), and Creighton Avenue (North Wing). =Relationship with Blanche Nevile School= The secondary school part of the Blanche Nevile School for Deaf Children is located on the site of Fortismere School. The two schools maintain a strong partnership and are connected to the same computer server.\\"Blanche Nevile School for Deaf Children\\", Fortismere. =Hosting Rustam School= Each Saturday Farsi is taught to a wide age spectrum. Governance The instrument of government requires 12 governors: one local authority governor; four parent governors elected by the parents; one staff governor; two partnership governors; three co-opted and the headteacher. There are four sub- committees: Curriculum, Physical Resources, Resources and Admissions. Admissions As a foundation school, Fortismere sets its own admission procedure. The duty to have a fair admissions procedure was defined by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. All students are funded by their local authority. For year 7 entry it has a published admissions number of 243, which is 8 form entry. Applications are made through the local authority transfer procedure system. The school is responsible for defining the order of priority when more than 243 children apply. Pupils with a Statement of Special Educational Needs or an Education, Health and Care Plan which names the school, are automatically offered a place. Places then go to Looked after children/previously looked after children, then to children with exceptional medical or social need, then to children with siblings in the school, and children of members of staff. Finally other children are selected by the distance they live from the reception area in the South Wing building. Year 12 entry is dependent on students having five C-grade GCSE passes or better, including English or Maths. For academic courses they must have the equivalent of five B-grade passes in Maths, English and the subjects they wish to study and any other published requirement. For the applied courses the bar is set at C-grade passes. Academic students are expected to pass the equivalent AS level exam before advancing into year 13. There are a minimum of 50 extra places available for students transferring from other schools. Curriculum As of 2010, the school follows the National Curriculum in Years 7‚Äì11 and offers a broad range of GCSEs, (national exams which are taken by students aged 14‚Äì16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16‚Äì18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but as is required by law, religious education is given throughout the school, and students may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE options. Key Stage 3 of the National Curriculum is covered during years 7, 8 and 9, though most subjects will commence using Key Stage 4 (i.e. GCSE) material during year 9. The 'Core Key Stage 3 Subjects' are English, Mathematics and Science. The Foundation Subjects are Art & Design, Geography, History, Music, Physical Education, Technology, Information Technology, Modern Languages. Additional Subjects are Religious Education, Drama and Wellbeing. The five cross-curricular themes are Careers, Wellbeing, Economic and industrial awareness, Environmental education and Health education. Key Stage 4 students study up to 10 GCSEs, depending on their ability. There are four core subjects studied by all students and four options delivered by a varied options system. This allows for the study of three separate sciences, as well as two languages and a range of courses, including vocational options. French, German, Spanish and Mandarin are offered. The English Baccalaureate will be awarded to any pupil who secures good GCSE or iGCSE passes (C and above) in all of the following subject areas: English, Maths, two sciences (which includes computer science), a foreign language, history or geography. This qualification is of particular interest to Russell Group universities. In addition to the subjects studied at Key Stage 3, Business Studies, Economics, ICT to include ECDL, Media Studies, Music Technology, Sports Studies, Health and Fitness, Photography, Engineering, Fashion and Textiles, Food and Catering, Performing Arts, Princes trust (Certificate), and Sociology are offered. Students who opt to stay on after sixteen study for BTEC or A levels. The following courses are offered Biology, Chemistry, Classical Civilisation, Computer Science, Drama & Theatre Studies, Economics, English, Film Studies, Fine Art, Geography, History, Mandarin Pre-U, Maths, Media Studies, French, Spanish, German, Music. Music Technology, philosophy, Photography, Physics, Politics, Product Design, Psychology, Sociology. Entry to each course is dependent on GCSE exam grades. Students who fail to obtain a good AS-level pass, are advised to retake it before continuing the A level course in year 13. Extracurricular activities School clubs and societies include various language clubs, sport clubs, and musical activities.

He wrote novels, critiques, a play, and poetry. His literary works were noted for their dreamlike abstraction, elegant style and refined vocabulary. He was close to the surrealist movement, in particular its leader Andr√© Breton. Life Gracq first studied in Paris at the Lyc√©e Henri IV, where he earned his baccalaur√©at. He then entered the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1930, later studying at the √âcole libre des sciences politiques (Sciences Po.), both schools of the University of Paris at the time. In 1932, he read Andr√© Breton's Nadja, which deeply influenced him. His first novel, The Castle of Argol, is dedicated to that surrealist writer, to whom he devoted a whole book in 1948. In 1936, he joined the French Communist Party but quit the party in 1939 after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was signed. During the Second World War, he was a prisoner of war in Silesia with other officers of the French Army. One of the friendships he formed there was with author and literary critic Armand Hoog, who later described Gracq as a passionate individualist and ferociously anti-Vichy.Bernhild Boie, ¬´ Chronologie ¬ª, in Julien Gracq, ≈íuvres I, Paris, Gallimard, Biblioth√®que de la Pl√©iade, p. LXI. In 1950, he published a fierce attack on contemporary literary culture and literary prizes in the review Emp√©docle titled La Litt√©rature √† l'estomac. When he won the Prix Goncourt for The Opposing Shore (Le Rivage des Syrtes) the following year, he remained consistent with his criticism and refused the prize. Gracq taught history and geography in secondary school (high school) until he retired in 1970. In 1979, he wrote the foreword to a re-edition of the Journal de l'analogiste (1954) by Suzanne Lilar, a work he called a \\"sumptuous initiation to poetry\\" (\\"une initiation somptueuse √† la po√©sie\\"). In 1989, Gracq's work was published by the Biblioth√®que de la Pl√©iade. He remained distant from major literary events and faithful to his first publisher, Jos√© Corti. Gracq lived a quiet life in his native town of Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, on the banks of the Loire River. On 22 December 2007, a couple of days after suffering a dizzy spell, he died at the age of 97 in a hospital in Angers. The Opposing Shore The Opposing Shore (Le Rivage des Syrtes, 1951) is Julien Gracq's most famous novel. A novel of waiting, it is set in an old fortress close to a sea which defines the ancestral border between the stagnant principality of Orsenna and the territory of its archenemy, the mysterious Farghestan. Its lonely characters are caught in a no man's land, waiting for something to happen and wondering whether something should be done to bring about change, particularly when change may mean the death of civilisations.

Hito Steyerl‚Äôs work pushes the boundary of traditional video, often obscuring what is real beneath many layers of metaphors and satirical humor. She referred to her piece, Red Alert, as \\"the outer limit of video\\". It consisted of three monitors playing a video of pure red, representing Lovely Andrea, as well as symbolizing the extreme danger and lust that had become a normality. Her work concerns topics of militarization, surveillance migration, the role of media in globalization, and the dissemination of images and the culture surrounding it. Steyerl has pushed both the role and the label of fine artist, which is demonstrated through her tendencies and interests in engaging the presentational context of art. Her work is developed from research, interviews, and the collection of found images, culminating in pedagogically-oriented work in the realm of forensic documentaries and dream-like montages. In 2017, Steyerl was listed as the number one most influential person in the contemporary art world. In recent years, Steyerl's work has expanded to confront the status of images in an increasingly digital world, institutions (including museums), networks, and labor. Her work has addressed the topic of corporate sponsorship by engaging with institutions, including Drill in 2019 at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, for which Steyerl revealed histories connecting the building hosting the exhibition with the founding of the National Rifle Association. On the topic of private funding, Steyerl has expressed: 'Ultimately, it will be important to move beyond protests against individuals and try to frame the problems more generally in terms of a new charter for the art world: a set of principles that include different aspects, like pay, sponsorship, governance, transparency standards, representation, sustainability, and so on, like a new deal for museums.' Steyerl employs increasingly complex approaches to pixelation within the digital sphere, editing, digital graphics, and video installation architecture. =Solo exhibitions= Installation view of Hell Yeah Fuck We Die, 2016 Steyerl has had numerous solo exhibitions, including: * Hito Steyerl, Chisenhale Gallery, London (2010)\\"Archive Past Exhibitions Hito Steyerl\\" , Chisehale Gallery, Retrieved 10 August 2014. * Hito Steyerl, E-flux, New York (2012)Cotter, Holland. \\"Hito Steyerl Has New York Solo Debut at e-flux\\", The New York Times, Retrieved 10 August 2014. * Hito Steyerl, Art Institute of Chicago, (2012)\\"focus: Hito Steyerl\\", Art Institute of Chicago, Retrieved 10 August 2014. * Hito Steyerl, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands (2014)\\"Van Abbemuseum: Detail\\" , Van Abbemuseum, Retrieved 10 August 2014. * Hito Steyerl, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London (2014)\\"What's On: Hito Steyerl\\" , ICA London, Retrieved 10 August 2014. * En defensa de la imagen pobre (\\"In defense of the poor image\\") and Arte, control y dominaci√≥n. 3 pel√≠culas de Hito Steyerl (\\"Art, control and domination. 3 films of Hito Steyerl\\"), MUNTREF as part of the Bienal de la Imagen en Movimiento (BIM) (2014)Exposici√≥n: En defensa de la imagen pobre , Bienal de la Imagen en Movimiento, Retrieved 21 November 2014.Proyecciones: Arte, control y dominaci√≥n. 3 pel√≠culas de Hito Steyerl , Bienal de la Imagen en Movimiento, Retrieved 21 November 2014. * Hito Steyerl, How Not To Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational Installation, Andrew Kreps Gallery, New York (2014) * Hito Steyerl, Artists Space, New York (2015)\\"Hito Steyerl\\", Artists Space Exhibitions, Retrieved 31 May 2015. * Hito Steyerl, Left To Our Own Devices, KOW, Berlin (2015) * Hito Steyerl, Duty-Free Art , Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid (2015) * Hito Steyerl, Factory of the Sun, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2016) * Hito Steyerl, Factory of the Sun, Hartware MedienKunstVerein in the Dortmunder U, Dortmund, Germany (2016) * Hito Steyerl, Power Plants, Serpentine Galleries, London (2019) * Hito Steyerl, This is the Future, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada (2020) =Group exhibitions= Steyerl has participated in numerous group exhibitions, including: * Dispersion, Institute of Contemporary Arts (2008) * International Film Festival Rotterdam (2010) * The Global Contemporary: Art Worlds After 1989, Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany (2011) * No one lives here, Royal College of Art (2013) * Bad Thoughts, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2014) * Cut To Swipe, Museum of Modern Art, New York (2014) * A screaming comes across the sky, LABoral, Gij√≥n, Spain (2015) * MashUp: the Birth of Modern Culture, Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver (2015) * Dreamlands: Immersive Cinema and Art, 1905-2016, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2016) * Hito Steyerl, Ben Rivers, Wang Bing.

These lessons include how to 1. Make something invisible for a camera, 2. Be invisible in plain sight, 3. Become invisible by becoming a picture, 4. Be invisible by disappearing, and 5. Become invisible by merging into a world made of pictures. Many of these methods may seem impossible. How Not to Be Seen is a satirical take on instructional films. Much of the video also deals with surveillance and digital imagery: for example, figures in all black dance around as \\"pixels,\\" and aerial photography features frequently. Thus, How Not to be Seen becomes a tutorial for invisibility in an age of intense hypersurveillance. = Liquidity, Inc. = 30:00 minutes Liquidity, Inc., (from 2014) consists of a video and a seating/backdrop installation. The video includes interviews with Jason Wood, a financial-advisor-turned-MMA-fighter, mesmerizing clips of ocean waves, and mock-weather reports from characters in balaclavas. As these visuals swirl around, a metaphor forms between water and images/money/trend in the digital age. = Factory of the Sun = Factory of the Sun, like Liquidity, Inc. deals with finance. In this video, which debuted at the 2015 Venice Biennial, clip art people swarm and create \\"artificial sunshine\\" for a bank. The video utilizes light, sunshine, and warmth as motifs as it explores surveillance and mega- finance. Awards In 2010 Steyerl was awarded with the NEW:VISION Award at the Copenhagen International Documentary Festival for her film In Free Fall.Knegt, Peter. \\"Thinking Outside the Doc Box\\", Indiewire, Retrieved 10 August 2014. In 2015 Steyerl won the inaugural EYE Prize, a collaboration between EYE Film Institute Netherlands and the Paddy & Joan Leigh Fermor Arts Fund.

Being a part of the TVN Network, TVN24 has been owned since July 2017 by US- based TV content provider Discovery. It gained broader popularity after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, which was the first major incident to be covered by TVN24. It is available over all digital platforms in Poland (Cyfrowy Polsat and nc+) as well as in most cable networks and some networks in other countries, including USA (Dish Network) and Germany. The audio portion of the channel can be streamed on the internet. On February 6, 2018, the European Commission approved the deal. Since Liberty Global, which operates pay television services in Poland under the UPC Polska brand, is a major shareholder in Discovery Inc, the EU required that Discovery ensure the continued availability of TVN24 and TVN24 BiS to third-party TV providers. The TVN24 team is also responsible for the TVN flagship newscast, Fakty TVN, and for the weather and lifestyle channel TVN Meteo Active. During major events (most recently September 11 attacks, Pope John Paul II's death and the Polish presidential plane crash), TVN24 is transmitted by TVN which has much wider broadcast range.

His work with the synthesis of graphene oxide, its mechanism of formation, and its use in capturing radionuclides from water is extensive. Tour has developed oxide based electronic memories that can also be transparent and built onto flexible substrates. His group has all developed the use of porous metal structures to make renewable energy devices including batteries and supercapacitors, as well as electronic memories. More recently, the Tour‚Äôs group discovery of laser- induced graphene (LIG) has led to an enormous research area for graphene researchers worldwide, and this platform is being used to build an array of device structures made from LIG foams. His lab‚Äôs discovery of the flash graphene process in 2019 for the 10-millisecond bulk formation of graphene from any carbon source, including coal, petroleum coke, biochar, food waste and even mixed plastic waste, is quickly being realized as a major development for environmental stewardship through materials and waste upcycling. Tour worked in molecular electronics and molecular switching molecules. He pioneered the development of the Nanocar, single-molecule vehicles with four independently rotating wheels, axles, and light-activated motors. Tour was the first to show that Feringa-based motors can be used to move a molecule on a surface using light as opposed to electric current from an STM tip. His early career focused upon the synthesis of conjugated polymers and precise oligomers. Tour has also been involved in scientific outreach, such as NanoKids, an interactive learning DVD to teach children fundamentals of chemistry and physics. He also developed SciRave, a Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero package to teach science concepts to middle school and elementary school students. and much work on carbon nanotubes and graphene. In the Scientific American article \\"Better Killing Through Chemistry\\", which appeared a few months after the September 11 attacks, Tour highlighted the ease of obtaining chemical weapon precursors in the United States. Tour‚Äôs intellectual property has been the basis for the formation of numerous companies including Weebit (silicon oxide electronic memory), Dotz (graphene quantum dots), Zeta Energy (batteries), NeuroCords (spinal cord repair), Xerient (treatment of pancreas cancer), LIGC Application Ltd. (laser-induced graphene), Nanorobotics (molecular nanomachines in medicine), Universal Matter Ltd. (flash graphene synthesis), Roswell Biotechnologies (molecular electronic DNA sequencing), and Rust Patrol (corrosion inhibitors). Awards Tour became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2020 and was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry's Centenary Prize for innovations in materials chemistry with applications in medicine and nanotechnology. Tour was inducted into the National Academy of Inventors in 2015. He was named among \\"The 50 most Influential Scientists in the World Today\\" by TheBestSchools.org in 2014. Tour was named \\"Scientist of the Year\\" by R&D; Magazine in 2013. Tour won the ACS Nano Lectureship Award from the American Chemical Society in 2012. Tour was ranked one of the top 10 chemists in the world over the past decade by Thomson Reuters in 2009. That year, he was also made a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Other notable awards won by Tour include the 2008 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology, the NASA Space Act Award in 2008 for his development of carbon nanotube reinforced elastomers, the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society (ACS) for his achievements in organic chemistry in 2007, the Small Times magazine's Innovator of the Year Award in 2006, the Southern Chemist of the Year Award from ACS in 2005, the Honda Innovation Award for Nanocars in 2005, the NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1990, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 1989. In 2005, Tour's journal article \\"Directional Control in Thermally Driven Single-Molecule Nanocars\\" was ranked the Most Accessed Journal Article by the American Chemical Society. Tour has twice won the George R. Brown Award for Superior Teaching at Rice University in 2007 and 2012. In 2016, Tour was listed as an ISI highly cited researcher. A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism In 2001, Tour was one of a small number of nationally prominent researchers among the five hundred scientists and engineers whose names appeared on the Discovery Institute's controversial petition, \\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\\". The petition states \\"we are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\\" The two-sentence statement has been widely used by its sponsor, the Discovery Institute, and some of their supporters in a national campaign to discredit evolution and to promote intelligent design. \\"To those who are disconcerted or even angered that I signed a statement back in 2001\\" he responded \\"I have been labeled as an Intelligent Design (ID) proponent. I am not. I do not know how to use science to prove intelligent design although some others might. I am sympathetic to the arguments on the matter and I find some of them intriguing, but the scientific proof is not there, in my opinion. So I prefer to be free of that ID label. As a modern-day scientist, I do not know how to prove intelligent design using my most sophisticated analytical tools‚Äî the canonical tools are, by their own admission, inadequate to answer the intelligent design question. I cannot lay the issue at the doorstep of a benevolent creator or even an impersonal intelligent designer. All I can presently say is that my chemical tools do not permit my assessment of intelligent design.\\" He explained that he felt the explanations offered by evolution are incomplete, and he found it hard to believe that nature can produce the machinery of cells through random processes. On his website, he writes that \\"In biology, the mechanisms for such transformations are complete mysteries. I posit that the gross chemical changes needed for macroevolution (defined here as origin of the major organism groups, i.e. of body plans) are not understood and presently we cannot even suggest the mechanisms, let alone observe them‚Ä¶One day the requisite chemical basis might become apparent so that the questions can be answered. But present-day biology is far from providing even a chemical proposal for body plan changes, let alone a data-substantiated chemical mechanism.\\" In his lectures, Tour has referred to modern biology‚Äôs explanations for evolution of complex systems as little more than story- telling. Tour has written extensively on his viewpoint that all scientific studies to date are wholly inadequate to account for life. In multiple essays in the Inference: International Review of Science, Tour argues from a chemical perspective that the molecules needed for life - nucleotides, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids - are too complex to have been formed by probabilistic chance and the methods to assemble those structures into a cell are unknown.Ultimately, he believes that on matters of life's origin, which is the genesis for all evolution, that scientists are \\"utterly clueless\\". Though he remains open to the possibility that future research will afford an explanation. In Lee Strobel's book The Case For Faith - the following commentary is attributed to Tour: \\"I build molecules for a living, I can't begin to tell you how difficult that job is. I stand in awe of God because of what he has done through his creation. Only a rookie who knows nothing about science would say science takes away from faith. If you really study science, it will bring you closer to God.\\" References External links * James Tour Research Group * NanoKids 1959 births Organic chemists Carbon scientists 21st-century American chemists Nanotechnologists Syracuse University alumni Living people Purdue University alumni Intelligent design advocates University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison alumni Stanford University alumni Rice University faculty Highly Cited Researchers 20th-century American chemists Scientists from New York City ","title":"James Tour"},{"id":"1791487","text":"John C.

It was founded as Pearl River County Agricultural High School in 1909 and became the first junior college in Mississippi in 1921. History Pearl River County Agricultural High School (PRCAHS) was the result of the Mississippi Agricultural High School Law of 1908, making it the nation's first state-funded system of agricultural high schools. The law was found to be in violation of the separate but equal clause in the state's constitution by the state's Supreme Court late in 1909 when no equal opportunity was offered for the state's African-American children. The overturned law caused all but three of the twenty original agricultural high schools in the state to close, since state funding was no longer available. Pearl River County citizens came to the school's rescue, however, when private citizens secured a loan from a local bank to fund the school until the Mississippi Legislature could pass a new law which made opportunity for both races. Classes began on September 8, 1909 under the direction of Professor T.M. Kelly. The entire boarding high school was located in one three-story building erected on of land on the edge of the county's seat, Poplarville. Classrooms and the cafeteria was located on the building's first floor, while the girls' dormitory occupied the second floor and the boys' dormitory occupied the third floor. PRCAHS, under the supervision of James Andrew Huff, added freshman college classes to the curriculum to the school in 1921-22, making Pearl River College the first 2-year public institution in Mississippi. Pearl River College continued to lead the way by the addition of sophomore classes in 1925-26. Pearl River College has since expanded to include four locations, the main campus in Poplarville, the Forrest County Center and Lowery Woodall Advanced Technology Center in Hattiesburg, MS, and the Hancock Center in Waveland, MS. In August 2005, PRCC's Poplarville campus suffered an estimated $40‚Äì50 million in damage at the hand of Hurricane Katrina. This included severe structural damage to the auditorium wing of Moody Hall, the state's oldest instructional building on a junior college campus, and M. R. White Coliseum, the college's sports arena. Both the auditorium wing of Moody Hall and the entire sports arena were razed for student safety. A new M. R. White Coliseum was built on the same site, and the Ethel Holden Brownstone Center for the Arts was built to replace Moody Hall Auditorium. Most of the roofs on campus had to be replaced due to the storm, and many buildings had to undergo extensive mold remediation. The Hancock Center, on the Gulf Coast, was completely gutted by the massive tidal surge. The main campus was shut down for three weeks due to damages and the Hancock Center was shut down for four weeks.

Sports Pearl River's athletic teams are called the Wildcats, and the football team won four straight Mississippi Association of Community & Junior Colleges (MACJC) championships (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006) since head coach Tim Hatten took over the program in 2002. Pearl River also won the 2004 National Championship of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) with the help of three NJCAA All-Americans, including wide receiver Larry Brackins, who was selected 155th overall by the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2005 NFL Draft; quarterback Jimmy Oliver, and offensive lineman Matt Lott. PRCC played for the 2006 NJCAA title in the Pilgrim's Pride Bowl Classic in Mt. Pleasant, Tex., but lost to Blinn College (Tex.) 19-6. Brackins was a member of the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League, and the practice squad for the NFL New York Jets. While former Wildcat receiver Donavan Morgan plays with the AFL's Chicago Rush franchise after brief NFL stints with the New York Jets, Houston Texans, and Buffalo Bills. Larry Kendrick, Brackins' 2003 Wildcat teammate, signed on with the Ole Miss Rebels following the one-year stint at Pearl River and was an NJCAA All-American as a wide receiver and a defensive back, as well as being named the NJCAA's Male Athlete of the Year in 2003. Kendrick currently plays in the Arena 2 league. PRCC's 2006 state title marked its 19th in school history, which is a record for Mississippi community colleges. Oliver guided the Wildcats to their 2004 and 2005 titles and earned NJCAA \\"Offensive Player of the Year\\" honors both seasons, including All- American accolades. Oliver played two seasons with Jackson State University, guiding the Tigers to the 2007 SWAC championship. Pearl River won four MACJC state championships during the 2003-2004 school year in football, men's basketball, women's soccer, and baseball. PRCC also won the 2005 MACJC women's soccer championship. Three former Wildcat players are currently in the NFL, including San Diego Charger wide receiver Demetrius Byrd (who also won the 2008 BCS National Championship with the LSU Tigers after playing for PRCC), Washington Redskin defensive linemen Cornelius Griffin, and Oakland Raider defensive back Hiram Eugene. Former PRCC basketball standout James Singleton played two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and currently plays for the Washington Wizards.

Truman signs the Atomic Energy Act into law on August 1, 1946. Behind the President, left to right, are Senators Tom Connally, Eugene D. Millikin, Edwin C. Johnson, Thomas C. Hart, Brien McMahon, Warren R. Austin and Richard B. Russell Jr. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) determined how the United States would control and manage the nuclear technology it had jointly developed with its World War II allies, the United Kingdom and Canada. Most significantly, the Act ruled that nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management would be under civilian, rather than military control, and established the United States Atomic Energy Commission for this purpose. It was sponsored by Senator Brien McMahon, a Democrat from Connecticut, who chaired the United States Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, and whose hearings in late 1945 and early 1946 led to the fine tuning and passing of the Act. The Senate passed the Act unanimously through voice vote, and it passed the House of Representatives 265‚Äì79. Signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on August 1, 1946, it went into effect on January 1, 1947, and the Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project. The Act was subsequently amended to promote private development of nuclear energy under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United States and its allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which had participated in the Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies. Origins Nuclear weapons were developed during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists working on the project anticipated that their development would have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required to win the war. Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the Military Policy Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned a similar study by Richard Tolman. Both reports called for a comprehensive, government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects. In July 1944, Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant and Irvin Stewart produced a proposal for domestic legislation to control nuclear energy. Conant submitted this to the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson in September 1944, and then to the Interim Committee, a body created by President Harry S. Truman in May 1945 to supervise, regulate and control nuclear energy until such a time as Congress created a permanent body to do so. In June 1945, the Interim Committee asked George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and a member of the committee, to prepare legislation. Creation of the Act =May‚ÄìJohnson Bill= Harrison brought in two experienced Harvard Law School-educated War Department lawyers, Brigadier General Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury Jr. to take up the job of drafting the legislation. The legislation was based on Bush and Conant's proposal, and the organization that it proposed was based on the existing structure of the Manhattan Project. Their draft bill would have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, operate facilities, conduct research, regulate all forms of nuclear energy and administer its own security, administrative and audit regimes. Royall and Marbury envisaged nuclear energy being controlled by experts, with a minimum of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would be in the hands of an administrator and his deputy. The Royall‚ÄìMarbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy. On October 3, 1945, the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Andrew J. May from Kentucky, the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, and in the Senate by Senator Edwin C. Johnson from Colorado, the ranking member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. The bill was known as the May-Johnson Bill for its sponsors. May immediately had the bill referred to the Military Affairs Committee, which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee. But in the Senate Military Affairs Committee, the bill was held up by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. There was a storm of criticism from scientists, particularly those at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Le√≥ Szil√°rd and Harold Urey were particularly notable critics. The bill created a powerful administrator and deputy administrator, and specifically stated that they might be members of the armed forces. It was feared that they would dominate the part-time commissioners. The fact that the bill emphasized that the administrator had to keep the deputy fully informed further aroused suspicion that the administrator would be an Army officer and the deputy a Navy officer. The secrecy provisions also frightened many scientists; it contained severe penalties of up to ten years imprisonment and $10,000 in fines for security breaches. The Chicago Sun headline accused the War Department of attempting to railroad the legislation through Congress. Legislators found themselves in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, and the nature of nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military. =McMahon Bill= On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, drafted by the Senate Military affairs Committee, which quickly became known as the McMahon Bill. This was initially a very liberal bill regarding the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson Bill also provided for civilian control. The McMahon Bill attempted to address the controversial aspects of the May-Johnson Bill. The number of commissioners was reduced to five, and they would serve full-time. No exemption was provided for serving military officers. An amendment specified that they have staggered terms of five years. While the bill was being debated, the news broke on February 16, 1946, of the defection of Igor Gouzenko in Canada, and the subsequent arrest of 22 people. The members of Congress debating the bill feared that \\"atomic secrets\\" were being systematically stolen by Soviet atomic spies. McMahon convened an executive session at which Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and Groves were called to appear. Groves revealed that the British physicist Alan Nunn May had passed information about the Manhattan Project to Soviet agents. The more conservative elements in Congress now moved to toughen the act. Section 10, which was formerly titled \\"Dissemination of Information\\", now became \\"Control of Information\\". This new section contained the novel doctrine later described as \\"born secret\\" or \\"classified at birth\\". All information concerning the design, development and manufacture of nuclear weapons was \\"restricted data\\", and regardless of how it was derived or obtained, was considered classified unless it was specifically declassified. This restriction on free speech, covering an entire subject matter, is still enforced. The \\"wall of secrecy\\" set up by the Act meant that atomic energy research and development had to be conducted under the supervision of the Atomic Energy Commission. Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, who sponsored the McMahon Bill in the House, vigorously defended the dissemination provisions of Section 10 against counterarguments. She dismissed objections that it would \\"give away the secret of the bomb\\", asserting that America's advantage in nuclear weapons could only be temporary, whereas the bill could perpetuate its lead in scientific research. An important addition, known as the Vandenberg Amendment, created a Military Liaison Committee to advise the commission on defense matters. Section 2 of the Act also created a General Advisory Committee, and a new Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to oversee the new organization. The first five Atomic Energy Commissioners. Left to right: alt=Five men in suits with hats and coats. The Senate passed the Act unanimously through voice vote on June 1, 1946. Considerable political maneuvering was required before it was passed by the House 265‚Äì79 on July 20. A compromise bill was then agreed to by both houses on July 26. Truman signed the compromise bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 on August 1, 1946. When it went into effect at midnight on January 1, 1947, the newly created Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project. Amendment =Private production of nuclear energy= An important omission from the Atomic Energy of 1946 was any mention of non-governmental use of nuclear energy, since military applications overshadowed all others at the time. The restrictions of the act related to secrecy, the control of fissile materials, the ownership of patents and the operation of production facilities placed a number of legal roadblocks in the way of private nuclear power stations. This was at odds with the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and resulted in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved insufficient in its objective of encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors. A series of accidents with research reactors, including partial core meltdowns, made private companies cautious, and reluctant to become involved with nuclear energy without protection from liability. This led to the Price‚ÄìAnderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act of 1957, which capped private liability for nuclear accidents, while providing for adequate compensations for accident victims. =International relations= Implementing the McMahon Act created a substantial rift between United States and Britain. The new control of \\"restricted data\\" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information, despite the fact that the British and Canadian governments, before contributing technology and manpower to the Manhattan Project, had made agreements with the United States about the post-war sharing of nuclear technology. Those agreements had been formalized in the 1943 Quebec Agreement. In the case of the United Kingdom, these were developed further in the 1944 Hyde Park Agreement, which was signed by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. The Hyde Park Agreement was lost in Roosevelt's papers after his death, and until the American copy of the document was found American officials were puzzled when the British mentioned it. The Quebec Agreement was an executive agreement that only applied to the Roosevelt administration, and the Senate had not seen the document. McMahon told Churchill in 1952 that \\"If we had seen this Agreement, there would have been no McMahon Act.\\" The McMahon Act fueled resentment from British scientists and Churchill, and led to Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. Lewis Strauss, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, proposed in January 1958 that the President should be able to share nuclear information with allies that were making \\"substantial and material contributions to the national defense and security\\". In addition to its own nuclear weapons, Britain had hosted American Strategic Air Command nuclear bombers since 1948. Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 in June 1958, and America and Britain again began sharing nuclear research under the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement. The stipulations contained in the Act caused significant controversy during debates over NATO's military command structure. Both Striking Fleet Atlantic and the United States Sixth Fleet have never been allowed to be placed anywhere but directly under American commanding officers‚Äîthe Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe‚Äîbecause the dominant legal interpretation of the McMahon Act has been that nuclear striking forces cannot be controlled by non- US commanders. This was the reason for the formation of Striking Fleet Atlantic as an independent entity, instead of being operationally subordinated to the UK Admiral serving as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic, in October‚ÄìNovember 1952. This was also the reason why the Sixth Fleet, in its NATO guise as Naval Striking and Support Force, South, was placed under American control rather than Allied Forces Mediterranean when the European commands were agreed at the same time. Case law A 2012 court decision concerning a state law attempting to shut down the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant affirmed that the Act gives the federal government exclusive authority over safety at nuclear power plants. This allowed Vermont Yankee to continue operating until it was voluntarily shut down by the owner for economic reasons in 2014.

L. Doctorow, loosely based on the lives, trial and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Doctorow tells the story of Paul and Rochelle Isaacson (corollaries to the Rosenbergs) through the persons of their older son, Daniel, and his sister, Susan, who are college students deeply involved in 1960s politics. Plot summary Writing his doctoral thesis ('The Book of Daniel'), a political genealogy of the American Old Left, T. V. Reed, \\"Genealogy/Narrative/Power: Questions of Postmodernity in Doctorow's The Book of Daniel,\\" American Literary History, 4.2:288-304 (July 1992), pp. 288-89. Daniel Isaacson confronts his own personal relationship to that historical narrative by investigating the background to his parents' conviction and execution by the State, with some assistance from his adoptive parents (the Lewins). The d√©nouement is the revisiting, in flashback, of the death of his parents, Rochelle and Paul Isaacson, and, in due course, the death from nervous disorder (and attempted suicide) of his sister Susan. The novel closes as the library in which Daniel is working is closed by student protests. Doctorow closes his novel with a parody of lines from Chapter 12 of the Biblical Book of Daniel. This moment culminates a merger of the text's two primary levels of narrative concern: Daniel's self-conscious inability to find and tell his own truthful personal history, which mirrors the anxiety of the radical 1960s New Left to emerge from the failure of the Communist Party to achieve its revolutionary potential in the 1950s.T. V. Reed, \\"Genealogy/Narrative/Power: Questions of Postmodernity in Doctorow's The Book of Daniel,\\" American Literary History, 4.2:288-304 (July 1992), pp. 288-89. The book is written in four parts, and in each Daniel is the principal narrator; the narrative moves fluidly and rapidly between 1967 ('the present') and flashback (to the late 40s/early 50s), and between first and third person: :1. Memorial Day ‚Äì Opens, in 1967, with Daniel, his young wife, Phyllis and baby Paul, walking to the sanatorium to see Susan; closes with the dropping of atom bomb in Japan :2. Halloween ‚Äì closes with the lawyer, Ascher, telling Daniel and Susan of the forthcoming start of the Isaacsons' trial :3. Starfish ‚Äì closes with Daniel's bruising involvement in an anti-draft march, while his sister (the starfish of the title) is lying dying from complications following her suicide attempt. : Daniel says to Phyllis through broken teeth '...It looks worse than it is. There was nothing to it. It is a lot easier to be a revolutionary nowadays than it used to be.' :4 Christmas ‚Äì recalls the closing moments of the trial, including the key evidence from their co-accused, Selig Mindish; Daniel's later search for, and discovery of Mindish, now senile, in Disneyland; and the funerals of Daniel's parents and his sister Susan. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The book was adapted as a film, Daniel (1983), directed by Sidney Lumet. Lumet somewhat changes the emphasis of the novel, to concentrate more on the 1940s left-wing politics of the parents. This was an era of which Lumet had close personal experience ‚Äì the film is generally less well-regarded than the book. Allusions/references to history, geography and current science *Neither the book nor the film makes direct reference to the Rosenberg events (though Lumet did claim that the execution scene was 'as it happened'). *The introduction of Susan as the younger child (rather than the second son of the Rosenbergs), and her lingering death, appears to be an attempt to distance the novel from being considered biographical. *Other key differences include ‚Äì Rochelle is a college graduate, Paul is not; this is the reverse of the Rosenbergs. Mindish appears to be a fusion of two historical figures, Morton Sobell and David Greenglass. *A key scene (in part 1), is the family's attendance at the Paul Robeson concert at Peekskill (1949); in the novel Paul leaves the bus to argue with the right-wing protesters and is violently set upon by them. *Another key scene has Daniel taking part in the 1967 anti-Vietnam war march on the Pentagon.

It is the important Jain Tirtha (pilgrimage site) for the Jains, believed to be the place where twenty of the twenty-four Jain tirthankaras along with many other monks attained Moksha, according to Nirvana Kanda and other texts. Its distance to cover is 44 kms by walk and takes approximately to climb up and down the hill. If a short route is taken it takes approximately 12 hours to complete.  Etymology  Shikharji means the \\"venerable peak\\". The site is also called Sammed ≈öikhar or Sammet Shikhar \\"peak of concentration.\\" because it is a place where twenty of twenty-four Tirthankaras attained Moksha through meditation. The word \\"Parasnath\\" is derived from Parshvanatha, the twenty-third Jain tirthankara, who was one of those who is believed to have attained Moksha at the site.  Geography  Shikarji is located in an inland part of rural east India. It lies on NH-2, the Delhi-Kolkata highway in a section called the Grand Trunk road Shikharji rises to making it the highest mountain in Jharkhand state.  History  The earliest reference to Shikharji as a tirth (place of pilgrimage) is found in the J√±ƒÅt·πõdhƒÅrmakƒÅtha, one of the twelve core texts of Jainism. Shikharji is also mentioned in the PƒÅr≈õvanƒÅthacarita, a twelfth century biography of PƒÅr≈õva. The popularity of Shikharji as a site of pilgrimage followed that of Vulture Peak, Bihar, where it is believed the Buddhist Sariputta attained enlightenment. Jharkhand acquired Shikharji under the Bihar Land Reforms Act, leaving the rights of Jains in doubt. Use of Shikharji as a tourist destination also impacts on the religious beliefs of the Jain.  Approach  Trail map showing tonks on Parasnath Hill The pilgrimage to Shikharji is a round trip of 27 km through the Madhuban forest. The section from Gandharva Nala stream to the summit is the most sacred to Jains. The pilgrimage is made on foot or by a litter or doli carried by a doliwallah along a concrete paved track. Along the track are shrines to each of the twenty four tirthankaras and vendors of tea, coffee, water, fruits and snacks. There is an option for parikrama of the entire Parasnath Hill, a pilgrimage of . The parikrama path is through the forest and is walking only. In 2019, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal included Sammed Shikharji under Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana.  Temples  Tonk of Parshvanatha, Shikharji The temple at Shikharji is a new construction with some parts dating to the eighteenth century. However, the idol itself is very old. Sanskrit inscriptions at the foot of the image date to 1678. At the base of Shikharji is a temple to Bhomiyaji (Taleti). On the walls of the Jain temple at the village of Madhuban, there is a mural painting depicting all the temples on Parasnath Hill. Temples along the track include: * Ganadhara * Kunthunatha * Rishabhanatha * Chandraprabha * Naminatha * Aranatha * MƒÅllƒ´nƒÅtha * Shreyanasanatha * Pushpadanta * Padmaprabha * Suvichran * Chandraprabha * Adinath * Anantanatha * Shitalanatha * Sambhavanatha * Vasupujya * Abhinandananatha * Ganadhara * Jal Mandir * Dharmanatha * Vardhaman * Varishen * Sumatinatha * Shantinatha * Mahavira * Suparshvanatha * Vimalanatha * Ajitanatha * Neminatha * Parshvanatha  Replicas  On August 13, 2012, the world's first to-scale complete replication of Shikharji was opened in Siddhachalam in New Jersey over 120 acres of hilly terrain.Shikharji at Siddhachalam Called Shikharji at Siddhachalam, it has become an important place of pilgrimage for the Jain diaspora. There is a small scale replica of Shikharji at DƒÅdƒÅbadƒ´, Mehrauli.  Transport  The nearest railway station named \\"Parasnath Station\\" is situated in Isri Bazar, Dumri, Jharkhand. Its around 25 km from Madhuban, at the base of Shikharji. Parasnath station is situated on Grand Chord, which is part of Howrah-Gaya-Delhi line and Howrah- Allahabad-Mumbai line. Many long distance trains have halts at Parasnath Station. Daily connectivities to Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur, Ajmer, Kolkata, Patna, Allahbad, Kanpur, Jammutawi, Amritsar, Kalka etc. are available. Even 12301-12302 Howrah Rajdhani Express via Gaya Junction has a halt on Parasnath station which run 6 days in a week. By Airway; Nearest airport is Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport, Durgapur (RDP) West Bengal and 4 hour drive from airport. Durgapur has direct flights from Kolkata and Delhi Birsa Munda Airport, Ranchi (IXR), Jharkhand is also around 180 Kms (Approximately 4.5 hours), and the drive to Shikhar Ji is quite smooth. Direct flights are available from Delhi. Shikharji Movement 'Save Shikharji' rally \\"Save Shikharji\\" is a protest movement by Jain sects who are against the state's development plans for Shikharji. Jain community members have opposed the plans of the state government to improve the infrastructure in the hill to boost tourism as alleged attempts to commercialize the Shikharji hill. This movement is currently headed by Yugbhushan Surishwarji, and demands Shikharji Hill to be declared officially as a place of worship by Government of Jharkhand.

Middle East =Ancient Near East= The belief in witchcraft and its practice seem to have been widespread in the past. Both in ancient Egypt and in Babylonia it played a conspicuous part, as existing records plainly show. It will be sufficient to quote a short section from the Code of Hammurabi (about 2000 BC). =Torah= In the Tanakh, references to witchcraft are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices which we read there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of fraud as upon the \\"abomination\\" of belief in the magic in itself. Verses such as Book of Deuteronomy 18:11-12 and Book of Exodus 22:18 \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\\" provided scriptural justification for Christian witch-hunters in the early modern period. The word \\"witch\\" is a translation of the Hebrew kashaf, \\"sorceress\\". The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments were enforced under the Hebrew kings: The Hebrew verb , translated in the King James Version as \\"cut off\\", can also be translated as \\"kill wholesale\\" or \\"exterminate\\". =New Testament= The New Testament condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had (Epistle to the Galatians 5:20, compared with the Book of Revelation 21:8; 22:15; and Acts of the Apostles 8:9; 13:6). There is some debate, however, as to whether the word used in Galatians and Revelation, pharmake√≠a, is properly translated as \\"sorcery\\", as the word was commonly used to describe the malicious use of drugs. =Islam= Divination and magic in Islam encompass a wide range of practices, including black magic, warding off the evil eye, the production of amulets and other magical equipment, evocation, cleromancy, astrology and physiognomy. Muslims, followers of the religion of Islam, do commonly believe in the existence of magic and black magic (sihr), and explicitly forbid the practice of it. Sihr is the word for \\"black magic\\" in Arabic. The best known reference to magic in Islam is in surah al-Falaq, which is a prayer to ward off black magic. Many Muslims believe that a person taught black magic to mankind: However, whereas performing miracles or good magic in Islamic thought is from Messengers (al- Rusul ‚Äì those who came with a new revealed text) and Prophets (al-anbiya ‚Äì those who came to continue the specific law and Revelation of a previous Messenger); supernatural acts are also believed to be performed by awliya ‚Äì the spiritually accomplished, through ma'rifa ‚Äì and referred to as karamat \\"extraordinary acts\\". Disbelief in the miracles of the Prophets is considered an act of disbelief; belief in the miracles of any given pious individual is not. Neither are regarded as magic, but as signs of Allah at the hands of those close to him that occur by his will and his alone. Muslim practitioners commonly seek the help of the jinn in magic (singular jinni). It is a common belief that jinns can possess a human, thus requiring exorcism. (The belief in jinn in general is part of the Muslim faith. Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj narrated the Prophet said: \\"Allah created the angels from light, created the jann from the pure flame of fire, and Adam from that which was described to you (i.e., the clay.)\\") Students of the history of religion have linked several magical practices in Islam with pre-Islamic Turkish and East African customs. Most notable of these customs is the zar.Geister, Magier und Muslime. D√§monenwelt und Geisteraustreibung im Islam. Kornelius Hentschel, Diederichs 1997, GermanyMagic and Divination in Early Islam (The Formation of the Classical Islamic World) by Emilie Savage-Smith (Ed.), Ashgate Publishing 2004 =Judaism= Jewish law views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with idolatry and/or necromancy; both being serious theological and practical offenses in Judaism. According to Traditional Jewish sources, it is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. Rabbis of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic. However, some of the Rabbis practiced \\"magic\\" themselves. For instance, Rabbah created a person and sent him to Rabbi Zera, and Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Oshaia studied every Sabbath evening together and created a small calf to eat (Sanhedrin 65b). In these cases, the \\"magic\\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from God rather than pagan gods) than as witchcraft. India Belief in the supernatural is strong in certain parts of India, and lynchings for witchcraft are reported in the press from time to time. According to the Indian National Crime Records Bureau, at least 2100 suspected witches (known as dayan) were murdered between 2000 and 2012. It is believed that an average of over 150 women per year are killed accused of being witches, concentrated across central India. Murder is commonly carried out by means of being burned, hacked or bludgeoned to death, often preceded by ritual humiliation, such as being stripped naked, smeared with filth and forced to eat excrement. For those accused of witchcraft who are not murdered, nearly all suffer permanent ostracism or banishment and their families face social stigma. Japan In Japanese folklore the witch can commonly be separated into two categories: those who employ snakes as familiars, and those who employ foxes.Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: RoutledgeCurzon, 1999. 51-59. =Fox Employers= The fox witch is by far the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the kitsune-tsukai, and the kitsune- mochi. The first of these, the kitsune-tsukai, gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The kitsune-tsukai then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of 'The Grateful Foxes'.http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml However, once a fox enters the employ of a man it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide him with many services. The fox can turn invisible and be set out to find secrets and it still retains its many powers of illusion which its master will often put to use in order to trick his enemies. The most feared power the kitsune- tsukai possesses is his ability to command his fox to possess other humans. =In popular culture= Magical girl genre may be the most commonly known to feature witchcraft, but it appears liberally in any works of fiction where such supernatural power can exist, despite the fact that such magic resembles more of western witchcraft than an oriental counterpart. Evil witch antagonists, borne out of the European concept of witch, are popular; however, their powers rarely stem from worshipping devils. Korea Attempting to influence others through spells in Joseon was widely censured by the royal court. On discovering that Consort Hwi-bin Kim had used witchcraft on the crown prince, Sejong the Great described her as a \\"sorcerer\\" or \\"evil monster\\" () and had her thrown out of the palace.*  Philippines  Philippine witches are the users of black magic and related practices from the Philippines. They include a variety of different kinds of people with differing occupations and cultural connotations which depend on the ethnic group they are associated with. They are completely different from the Western notion of what a witch is, as each ethnic group has their own definition and practices attributed to witches. The curses and other magics of witches are often blocked, countered, cured, or lifted by Philippine shamans associated with the indigenous Philippine folk religions. Central Asia Witchcraft is a feature of traditional mythology in Kazakhstan and Tajikistan documented since the 16th century. It is believed that once a human dies their soul is owned by the witch that murdered them.

He appeared in the musical Hair and at the Woodstock Festival, and released several albums as a singer-songwriter. Life and career Sommer grew up in Queens and Hartsdale, New York, and was a self- taught musician (piano and guitar), who began writing songs in his teens.Bruce Eder, Biography, Allmusic.com. Retrieved August 20, 2019 He attended Woodlands High School as well as Quintano's School for Young Professionals in Manhattan. He became friendly with other young musicians and songwriters in the area, including Peter Sabatino, Leslie West, Tom Feher, and Michael Brown, and wrote several songs for West (then known as Weinstein)'s band, the Vagrants, including their single \\"Beside the Sea\\", co-written with producer Felix Pappalardi and his wife Gail Collins.Sharon Watts, \\"We're All Playing In The Same Band\\", Shindig! No. 94, August 2019, pp.44‚Äì48 In 1967, Sommer joined Michael Brown's band, The Left Banke, as lead singer, replacing Steve Martin Caro and co-writing their single \\"And Suddenly\\" with Brown. He also sang lead on \\"Ivy Ivy\\", written by Tom Feher. The group (which included Michael McKean on bass) soon fell apart, following legal threats by Martin's lawyers. In the same baroque vein as the Left Banke, Sommer wrote \\"Brink of Death\\", recorded by the band Childe Harold. Next, he was recruited as a member of \\"the Tribe\\" for the musical Hair, and then promoted to the role of Woof. His \\"frizzed-out Afro\\" hair and eyes were featured on the Los Angeles Playbill for Hair in 1969. Sommer had been signed by Capitol Records, and in June 1969 released his first album, The Road to Travel, produced by Artie Kornfeld, as were his next two albums. Kornfeld's involvement with the Woodstock Festival led to Sommer being invited to perform there. He was the third act to perform on the opening Friday, August 15, 1969. He sang ten songs, including \\"Jennifer\\", a song inspired by his fellow Hair performer, Jennifer Warnes, and Simon & Garfunkel's \\"America\\", after which he received the festival's first standing ovation. Bert was accompanied by Ira Stone (guitar, Hammond Organ, Harmonica) and Charles Bilello on Bass. However, because he was signed to a rival record label, none of his performance was made publicly available until 2009. In 2019, the entire Bert Sommer set became part of the Woodstock 50th anniversary 38-CD set, restored by Andy Zax. Sommer's second album, Inside Bert Sommer, was released in May 1970 on the Eleuthera label, a subsidiary of Buddah Records, and featured the single \\"We're All Playing in the Same Band\\", which he wrote at, for, and about the Woodstock festival, about his experience there. The song reached number 48 on the Hot 100 in September 1970. Sommer continued to perform in and around New York, often opening the bill for major acts such as Ike and Tina Turner and the Byrds.Robert Ian Hawdon, \\"Bert Sommer ‚Äì The forgotten Woodstock artist\\", 8 August 2019.

Sommer spent some time in a rehabilitation facility in the early 1970s, then formed a trio in Brockport, New York. Sommer, Landis & Roberts, with Gary Roberts (also known as Johnny Rabb) and Rob Landis played local clubs and cafes in the college town for a couple years. While Sommer continued to write songs, he received another offer. After being encouraged to audition by music producer Artie Ripp, he appeared as \\"Flatbush\\" of Kaptain Kool and the Kongs on The Krofft Supershow in 1976, but did not reprise the role in the second season. In 1977, his fourth album, also titled Bert Sommer, produced in Los Angeles by Ron Dante, was released by Capitol Records. Again, the album was unsuccessful, and he was dropped by the label. The follow-up album that never happened, to have been produced by Trevor Lawrence, contained songs such as \\"You,\\" featured in the films The Patriot (1986) and Stella (1990). Sommer returned to Albany in August 1983 and almost immediately began to perform in local venues with Johnny Rabb, and Carla and Kevin McKrell, in The Fabulous Newports. He also teamed up with Eddie Angel and Johnny Rabb in The Poor Boys. His last performance was again with Rabb, at an outdoor concert in Troy, New York on June 11, 1990. Sommer died in Troy, New York on July 23, 1990, after a long battle with a respiratory illness. He is buried in Valhalla, NY.

Other services may be provided such a rental car, activities or outings during the holiday. Transport can be via charter airline to a foreign country, and may also include travel between areas as part of the holiday. Package holidays are a form of product bundling. Package holidays are organised by a tour operator and sold to a consumer by a travel agent. Some travel agents are employees of tour operators, others are independent. History =Organised tours= The first organised tours dated back to Thomas Cook who, on 5 July 1841, chartered a train to take a group of temperance campaigners from Leicester to a rally in Loughborough, eleven miles away. By 1872 he was undertaking worldwide tours, albeit with small groups. His company, Thomas Cook & Son (commonly called Thomas Cook or simply \\"Cook's\\"), grew to become one of the largest and most well known travel agents before being nationalised in 1948. With the gradual decline of visits to British seaside resorts after the Second World War, Thomas Cook & Son began promoting foreign holidays (particularly Italy, Spain and Switzerland) in the early 1950s. Information films were shown at town halls throughout Britain. However they made a costly decision by not going into the new form of cheap holidays which combined the transport and accommodation arrangements into a single 'package'. The company went further into decline and were only rescued by a consortium buy-out on 26 May 1972. =Group tours= Vladimir Raitz, the co-founder of the Horizon Holiday Group, pioneered the first mass package holidays abroad with charter flights between Gatwick airport and Corsica in 1950, and organised the first package holiday to Palma in 1952, Lourdes in 1953, and the Costa Brava and Sardinia in 1954. In addition, the amendments made in Montreal to the Convention on International Civil Aviation on 14 June 1954 was very liberal to Spain, allowing impetus for mass tourism using charter planes. By the late 1950s and 1960s, these cheap package holidays -- which combined flight, transfers, and accommodation -- provided the first chance for most people in the United Kingdom to have affordable travel abroad. One of the first charter airlines was Euravia, which commenced flights from Manchester Airport in 1961 and Luton Airport in 1962. Despite opening up mass tourism to Crete and the Algarve in 1970, the package tour industry declined during the 1970s. On 15 August 1974, the industry was shaken by the collapse of the second-largest tour operator, Court Line, which operated under the brand names of Horizon and Clarksons. Nearly 50,000 tourists were stranded overseas and a further 100,000 people faced the loss of booking deposits. In 2005 a growing number of consumers were avoiding package holidays and were instead travelling with budget airlines and booking their own accommodation. In the UK, the downturn in the package holiday market led to the consolidation of the tour operator market, which is now dominated by a few large tour operators. The major operators are Thomson Holidays and First Choice part of TUI AG and Thomas Cook AG. Under these umbrella brands are different holiday operators catering to different markets, such as Club 18-30 or traveleze. Budget airlines have also created their own package holiday divisions such as Jet2holidays or Japan Airlines's J-Pack special. The trend for package holiday bookings saw a comeback in 2009, as customers sought greater financial security in the wake of a number of holiday and flight companies going bust, and as the hidden costs of 'no-frills' flights increased. Coupled with the search for late holidays as holidaymakers left booking to the last moment, this led to a rise in consumers booking package holidays. Dynamic packaging Dynamic packaging is a method that is becoming increasingly used in package holiday booking procedures that enables consumers to build their own package of flights, accommodation, and rental car instead of a pre-defined packages. Dynamic Packaging allows guests to create their own vacation, similar to a private or custom tour. This method allows guests to use a company's itinerary or create their own to allow for more flexible options while using an agency's services.

The municipality population in 2011 was 29,213,.Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica The area size is 700.20 km¬≤. The city is subdivided into 23 parishes. The film festival, IMAGO ‚Äì Young Film and Video Festival, is organised in the town.IMAGO ‚Äì Young Film and Video Festival History During the Iron Age, from about 1000 B.C. until its destruction by the Romans, there was a Celtic Lusitanian Castro or fortified village in nearby S√£o Br√°s Mount. The remains of a villa or agricultural manor house, workers houses and other associated buildings from the time of the Roman Empire have been found in the underground of the centre of the current city. This villa was rebuilt as a fortified medieval mansion during the High Middle Ages. The history of Fund√£o is intimately related to that of its originally Jewish, then New Christian or Marrano, population. Although the place was already mentioned in documents from 1307 referring 32 houses, the bulk of the population only settled after the 1492 Expulsion of the Jews from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella, mainly Spanish Jews (sephardic). Close to the border, and already home to significant Jewish minorities the Cova da Beira region, the region received many refugees. They settled in the community of Fund√£o, which their numbers swelled to that of a city. The influx of Jewish artisans and merchants quickly transformed it into an important commercial and industrial center. With the establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition shortly thereafter, many Jews and New Christians were arrested, tortured, executed or had their possessions expropriated. The commercial dynamism of the city was affected. The place was proclaimed a city in 1580 by its notables, after support for their attempt was declared by Dom Ant√≥nio, Prior do Crato, to preserve Portuguese independence against the ambitions of King Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal). The Municipal Council and autonomy were granted in 1747. During the Enlightenment of the late 18th century, under the rule of Marquis of Pombal, the Prime-Minister of Portugal, legal restraints on the New Christians were abolished and rights equiparated to those of the Old Christians. Pombal tried to recreate the industrial pre√´minence of Fund√£o by founding the Royal Factories (today known as the City Hall). These efforts allowed a measure of revival to the wool industries of the city, and cloth was again exported to northern Europe. The city decayed again after its sack during the defeated Napoleonic French invasions of Portugal, and the subsequent Civil War between supporters of the Liberal Constitutionalist D. Pedro and his brother Conservative Absolutist D. Miguel, who were competing for the throne. Climate Parishes Administratively, the municipality is divided into 23 civil parishes (freguesias): * Alcaide * Alcaria * Alcongosta * Alpedrinha * Barroca * Bogas de Cima * Capinha * Castelejo * Castelo Novo * Enxames * Fatela * Fund√£o, Valverde, Donas, Aldeia de Joanes e Aldeia Nova do Cabo * Janeiro de Cima e Bogas de Baixo * Lavacolhos * Orca * P√™ro Viseu * P√≥voa de Atalaia e Atalaia do Campo * Silvares * Soalheira * Souto da Casa * Telhado * Tr√™s Povos * Vale de Prazeres e Mata da Rainha Economy The town is an important local center of industry and services. Around it lies some of the most fertile land in the region, in a large valley (Cova da Beira) between the Gardunha and Estrela ranges, where the Z√™zere River starts its way towards the Tagus. The most significant productions are cherries, peaches, olive oil, wine, wood pulp and vegetables. Some of the most important wolframite mines in the world (a mineral source for the element tungsten) are explored within its municipal limits. Other important mines extract lead and tin. High quality mineral water is bottled from several sources. The Cavleiro tree is a common trade item from this region. It is used in everyday products such as wooden dolls, shoes and bedposts.

History Early 18th century map showing the Duchy of Massa and Carrara The core of this territory was formed on 22 February 1473 when Iacopo Malaspina, Marquis of Massa, purchased the Lordship of Carrara (villages of Carrara, Moneta and Avenza). At first the marquis resided in Carrara but, as Carrara was frequently invaded by French forces, he moved to Massa. The house of Malaspina became extinct in the male line two generations later. In 1520 Ricciarda Malaspina, granddaughter of Iacopo and last direct heir of the house, married Lorenzo Cybo, member of an influential Genoese family related to the Medici and with Pope Innocent VIII. From this marriage originated the new house of Cybo-Malaspina. Under his rule the land went through a very prosperous period, thanks to a high demand for Carrara marble in various courts. Alberico I, aware that its territory was surrounded by more powerful and influential neighbors, submitted in 1554 to the Holy Roman Empire of Charles V. Due to cultural and economic achievements under the government of Alberico I, the city of Carrara was awarded the title of marquisate in 1558. In 1568 Massa was elevated to a principality by Emperor Maximilian II. In 1664 the territory of Massa became a duchy and Carrara became a principality. The Cybo-Malaspina gained the title of Dukes of Massa and Princes of Carrara. In 1738 Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, the last descendant of the family, married Ercole d'Este, the last male heir of the Duchy of Modena. Their daughter Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este thus passed both duchies to her son Francis. In 1796 the Este were deprived of their possessions by Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion. Napoleon annexed the territory to the Cispadane Republic, then merging it in the Cisalpine Republic. During this time the territory was briefly fought between Napoleon and the Austrian anti-French coalition (1799), and experienced a rapid succession of different administrative systems more or less provisional (Department of the Apuan Alps, Imperial and Royal Provisional Regency of Massa-Carrara, then again Department of the Apuan Alps and finally District of Massa). As a final administrative change, in 1806 the French emperor gave the Duchy of Massa and Carrara to the Principality of Lucca and Piombino, ruled by his elder sister Elisa Bonaparte. During the Napoleonic domination Mary Beatrice was forced to take refuge in Vienna at the court of her husband, the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, uncle of Emperor Francis I of Austria. With the fall of the Napoleonic regime, the Congress of Vienna reassigned to Mary Beatrice all the territories that had been subtracted. At that time the Duchy of Massa and Carrara included the territories of Massa and Carrara, Aulla, Casola in Lunigiana, Comano, Filattiera, Fivizzano, Fosdinovo, Licciana, Montignoso, Mulazzo, Podenzana and Tresana. In 1829, at the death of Mary Beatrice, the Duchy of Massa and Carrara was annexed to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio by her son Francesco IV d'Este. In 1859, with the deposition of Francesco V d'Este, the Duchy of Modena and Reggio (which also includes the territories of Massa and Carrara) was permanently attached to the Kingdom of Sardinia, with the formation of province of Massa-Carrara in December 1859.

In the conduct of foreign policy the Cybo-Malaspina maintained a role as an intermediary between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Republic of Genoa. Alberico I brought large urban restructurations in the cities of Carrara and Massa, mainly for prestige reasons. Both cities were equipped with new city walls - with representative functions, rather than military, since the policy of the territory was not expansionist - and new ducal palaces. In Carrara was established the Office of Marble (1564), to regulate the marble mining industry. The city of Massa, in particular, saw much of its plan redesigned (new roads, plazas, intersections, pavings) in order to make it worthy of an Italian country's capital. The War of Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714) was the beginning of the period of deep economic crisis for the duchy. The Empire punished with heavy fines the Cybo- Malspina, who had given hospitality to French troops on its territory. Already Alberich III, but especially Alderamo, found themselves forced to sell many city goods. Alderamo arrived to force people to buy food at a premium, and also because of the luxurious and extravagant lifestyle of the nobleman, the economics of the Duchy was brought to its knees. The financial situation recovered only by dynastic union between the families of the Malaspina and the Este, achieved with the marriage of Maria Teresa and Ercole d'Este in 1741. From that date, the Duchy of Massa and Carrara gradually lost its political autonomy, going to gravitate more and more closely into the city of Modena sphere of influence. Under the domination of the Este, the Duchy of Massa Carrara rose to occupy a strategic position, in that it provided a sea outlet to the hinterland domains and promised an easier trade route. Already under Maria Teresa road links between the Duchy of Modena and Reggio to Massa & Carrara were significantly improved. These road reform attempts include the construction of the Via Vandelli, starting as early as 1738. In 1751, was made a first attempt for the excavation of a dock and the construction of a port in the city of Carrara. The port would have been functional to the trade and military activities of the Este, would have housed in a safe place the small fleet of the Duchy of Modena and, finally, would have been essential to free the marble exports from dependence of other nearby ports. The coast, however, had a tendency to silt up and after a few years the construction work had to be suspended. In 1807 Napoleon's engineers built the important mail road to the Foce, to link the cities of Massa and Carrara through the inland hills. During the Napoleonic rule were also initiated other public works such as the bonification of the plains, the plantation of coastal pine trees to combat malaria and arrangement of river banks. These works were continued by Maria Beatrice and successors in subsequent decades. In 1821 the Este Land Registry was established, with the task of regulating and listing the properties of the inhabitants of the duchy. The years following the annexation to the Duchy of Modena were particularly complex, both for the insurrectional riots that characterized the historical period, and for the economic crisis, which have long gripped the region. The rulers tried several times to exit the stagnation in promoting the construction of infrastructure to increase the volume of trade, but the lack of money often proves an insurmountable obstacle. A second attempt to build the port of Carrara was entrusted by Duke Francis IV to the engineer Aschenden in 1830, but the project was never made for lack of funds. A dock loader, which came to be the first authentic port core of Carrara was built successfully only in 1851, thanks to the English engineer and tycoon William Walton. In 1846 the Count Francesco del Medico proposed to the Duke Francis V the construction of the Marble Railway of Carrara, to link the marble quarries to the sea and thereby facilitating the transport of blocks to the areas for sorting, loading, and shipping. This project was also suspended for lack of funds. The Marble Railway was finally built after the Italian unification (1871‚Äì1890). In the last years of the duchy, an increasing number of clashes was seen between the liberals and the ducal government, especially in Carrara. The territory was chosen by Count Camillo Benso di Cavour and Napoleon III to organize popular anti-Austrian riots and give France an opportunity to intervene on the side of Piedmont in Italy, giving way to the Second Italian War of Independence.

Dynamic packages differ from traditional package tours in that the pricing is always based on current availability, escorted group tours are rarely included, and trip-specific add- ons such as airport parking and show tickets are often available. Dynamic packages are similar in that often the air, hotel, and car rates are available only as part of a package or only from a specific seller. The term \\"dynamic packaging\\" is often used incorrectly to describe the less sophisticated process of interchanging various travel components within a package, however, this practice is more accurately described as \\"dynamic bundling\\". True dynamic packaging demands the automated recombination of travel components based on the inclusion of rules that not only dictate the content of the package but also conditional pricing rules based on various conditions such as the trip characteristics, suppliers contributing components, the channel of distribution, and terms of sale. Dynamic packages are primarily sold online, but online travel agencies will also sell by phone owing to the strong margins and high sale price of the product. Dynamic packaging is dynamic at several levels. Firstly, inventory is sourced dynamically, meaning the dynamic packaging solution will source flights, accommodation and car rental components for the package in real-time. Secondly, these components are dynamically combined into packages. Thirdly, the package is dynamically priced and is usually given an opaque total price. Benefits Dynamic packages are normally given a single, opaque price, meaning the wholesaler's cost of the individual components is hidden from the consumer. The wholesaler often obtains special package-only cost rates for travel components, such as negotiated fares for flights or special package rates for accommodation or car rental. These cost prices are typically significantly lower than the cost prices suppliers offer for the same products if they were to be sold as single components. Hence, the wholesaler will be able to offer the consumer a combined saving for the dynamic package, without reducing his own margins. Opaque pricing of dynamic packages hide the price of the included components. This has several benefits. Suppliers of travel products often impose a minimum selling price for their products. For instance, a hotel might give the wholesaler a room at cost price X, but on the condition that the room is not sold for less than Y (hotels do this to prevent wholesalers from competing with themselves). With dynamic packaging, the customer is not presented with the room price, only the overall package price, so hotels typically allow the wholesaler to discount the (hidden) price of the hotel more. Opaque pricing also has benefits for airlines. Airlines tend to increase their fares the closer you get to the departure date, even if there are many available seats. This is to \\"train\\" the consumers to book early, making it easier for the airline to do proper revenue management. If airlines were to dump their fares if a flight failed to fill up, then this would train the customers to wait until very close to departure before booking. This would make it virtually impossible for an airline to manage their fares (fares could then only be determined based on historical data and not based on current demand). Dynamic packaging allows an airline to get rid of distressed inventory at discounted fares, as the discounted fare is effectively hidden from the consumer. Preconditions Dynamic Packaging is also often misunderstood since it requires that the provider of Dynamic Packaging be a wholesaler, who must also issue tickets, vouchers or other redeemable coupons in order to become a Dynamic Packager. Without an inventory management system, and a ticket, coupon or voucher issuing system to make the prices of the individual components appear as one price to the consumer and allow each travel service provider to know what rate to accept or charge the traveler; dynamic packaging does not work. Many travel retailers have mistakenly assumed they could provide dynamic packaging without an inventory management system, mark-up engine with business rules and a ticket issuing and resolution system. The wholesaler must either directly control the inventory that is combined into packages or buy the package components up-front from other travel suppliers. This implies that dynamic packages (as with static packages) are always pre-paid by the customer. The wholesaler would typically also require special discounted fares/rates from the travel suppliers. For car rental, the supplier (car rental company or intermediary) should ideally supply their price based on calendar days rather than hour-by-hour. Calendar day rates reduce the number of vehicle availability/pricing scans the wholesaler must make. For packages that include flights, the outbound arrival and return departure date/times determine the car rental pick-up and drop-off date/times. If car rental rates were by the hour they would differ for each flight option, hence the wholesaler would have to issue a vehicle availability search for each available flight, while with 24-hour rates one single vehicle availability search is enough to cater for all flight options.

Borah was listed in Newsweek's Top 1500 high schools in the United States in 2008. In the 1970s and 1980s, Borah had nearly 2,000 students, with over 600 students Athletics =Football= Borah was the dominant football program in the state for the school's first quarter century, winning the Southern Idaho Conference and the A.P. writers' poll (introduced in 1963) in 15 of the first 21 seasons, as well as two of the first three official titles in the playoff system. Ed Troxel, a former head coach at the College of Idaho, was in the school's first nine seasons, with eight unofficial state titles and a runner- up. After an undefeated season in 1966, he left to become an assistant at the University of Idaho in Moscow and assistant coach Delane \\"De\\" Pankratz succeeded him as head coach for the next two decades. Pankratz' first five seasons as head coach brought five more state titles with only two defeats, to intra-city rival Capital in 1967 and 1971, separated by 34 consecutive victories. The 1971 team rebounded from the loss and won eight straight, with a final victory on Thanksgiving over Punahou in Honolulu to finish The Lions went undefeated in 1975, and in 1978, the last before the playoff system. Borah was the state runner-up in 1972, 1974, and 1976. In November 1979, an eight-team playoff was introduced for the state's largest schools in Class A-1 (5A since 2001); Borah shut out Lewiston in the semifinals and archrival Boise in the final to grab the first official A-1 state title in football, and finished with a record Both Borah and Boise returned to the finals in 1980, but with a different outcome as Boise won 7‚Äì0 with an early touchdown and a game-ending goal line stand. Borah finished at with two losses to Boise and one to Capital.Borah High School yearbook - Safari - 1981 (vol. 23) - p.61 In November 1981, undefeated Borah regained the state title with a win over in the Lions' closest game of the year (17 points). The Lions (12‚Äì0, with two shutouts) were unchallenged all season, winning by an average score of earning a national top-20 ranking in multiple publications. Through 2018, it is Borah's most recent state title Additional state championships that academic year were won by the Borah varsity basketball team and track & field team (the second of four straight), for a rare triple state title for the class of 1982. The Borah baseball team won the state title in 1981, but lost their opener at the state tourney Pankratz was the head football coach at Borah for twenty seasons and compiled a record of He was succeeded by in May 1987, the head coach at nearby Bishop Kelly for three seasons and a graduate of rival Capital. He had been an assistant for six years under Pankratz at Borah and a three-year starter at tackle at Idaho under Troxel. Overgaard was the head coach for seven seasons then left for an administrative position Darren Corpus, a Borah alumnus from the class of 1980, was hired as head coach in 2011. A longtime coach at feeder school West Junior High, he was the starting fullback on the 1978 and 1979 state champion teams and played college football at Boise State.matchput.com - Borah football - De Pankratz: Lion's coaching legend lives on - 2011 - accessed 2012-03-01 In his first season, he led the Lions to their first winning season in a decade.

A view of the country around Minden, part of ancient Engern The Angrivarii (or Angrivari) were a Germanic people of the early Roman Empire, who lived in what is now northwest Germany near the middle of the Weser river. They were mentioned by the Roman authors Tacitus and Ptolemy. They were part of the Germanic alliance of Arminius and his defeat of the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in the 9th year of the common era. The Angrivarii lived in an area which was later called Angria (Modern German \\"'\\") in the Middle Ages, which was a major part of the Carolingian Duchy of Saxony. Both names probably derive from geographical terminology. Location In his Germania Tacitus described the Angrivarii and their western neighbours the Chamavi living closer to the Rhine than \\"the Dulgubini and Chasuarii, and other tribes not equally famous\\" and east of the Frisii who lived towards the Rhine river which was the official border of the Roman Empire.Tacitus, Germania, 34. The Chasuarii probably lived near the Hase river and the Ampsivarii who lived on the Ems river, and the Dulgubini probably towards the Elbe. North of all these peoples lived the Chauci, whose territory stretched to the North Sea coast. Among the more detailed mentions of the Angrivarii which Tacitus makes in his Annals, he describes them also as neighbours to the powerful Cherusci people, of Arminius. They had built a dike to mark the boundary and this was west of the Weser.Tacitus, Annals, 2.19 Tacitus also notes in his Germania that together with the Chamavi, the Angrivarii had invaded the lands formerly held by the Bructeri to their southwest.Tacitus, Germania, 34. The Bructeri had lived near the Ems and Lippe rivers, between the Rhine and Weser.Strabo, Geography, 7.1; Ptolemy, Geography, 2.10 This occurred the Teutoburger battle. Name and etymology Upland meadow in Wiehengebirge, part of ancient Engern The name appears earliest in the Annales and Germania of Tacitus as Angrivarii. In Greek, Ptolemy called them the Angriouarroi (), which transliterates into Latin Angrivari. In post-classical history the name of the people had a number of different spellings in addition to the ones just mentioned. The name Angrivarii can be segmented Angri-varii meaning \\"the men of Engern\\", parallel to Ampsi-varii, \\"the men of the Ems\\". Engern, their region, is related to a word for meadows, as in modern German \\"\\", and appears as a component in placenames around Germany. Julius Pokorny derives the first element from an Indo-European root *ang-, \\"to bend, bow.\\" From this root are also derived German Anger, English dialect ing, Danish eng, Swedish √§ng, Dutch eng/enk, and many other forms in Germanic languages, all meaning \\"meadow, pasture.\\"Bjorvand and Lindeman (2007:227). Cf. the similar element Angeln. The second element -varii is most prolific among Germanic tribal names, commonly taken to mean \\"inhabitants of\\", \\"dwellers in\\". Its precise etymology remains unclear, but there is a general consensus that it cannot be derived from the PIE root *wihxr√≥s, \\"man\\", surviving in English \\"were-wolf\\".R√ºbekeil, Ludwig: \\"Diachrone Studien zur Kontaktzone zwischen Kelten und Germanen\\", Wien, 2002. , pp. 401-11. Their geographical-based name is associated with the 8th century region called Angria (Angaria, Angeriensis, Aggerimensis and Engaria), which was one of four subdivisions of Old Saxony (the others were Westfalahi and Ostfalahi and Nordalbingia). This region is now referred to in modern German as Engern, and it corresponds reasonably well with the area where the Angrivarii lived, comprising most of the country surrounding the middle Weser, including both flat land, as around Minden, and low hills (Holzminden). Ancient history Statue of Arminius. This is an idealization; no real likeness of him exists. Although the Angrivarii receive brief mention in Ptolemy (2.10) and the Germania of Tacitus (33), they appear mainly at several locations in Annales. They were involved marginally in the wars fought by the talented Germanicus Caesar on behalf of his uncle Tiberius, emperor of Rome, against the perpetrators of the massacre of three Roman legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, the year 9. The wars began in the last years of the reign of Augustus, first emperor of Rome. Augustus died an old but respected man in the year 14 and was celebrated with much pomp and splendor. He left a document to be read to the senate posthumously, expressly forbidding extension of the empire beyond the Rhine. News of the will was welcomed by the Germans, thinking it gave them a free hand in the region. Germanicus found it necessary to pacify the border, which he did by a combination of scorched earth raids and offers of alliance with Rome - in short, stick and carrot. These raids also kept the army of the lower Rhine distracted from the possibility of mutiny, which had broken out on Augustus's death and only been quelled by concessions and executions. For punitive expeditions Germanicus used the Ems river, which flowed from the heart of the country occupied by the tribes that became the Franks. These were still under Arminius, who had led the German confederation to the victory in 9. Unlike Arminius' native tribe, the Cherusci, the loyalty of the other tribes in the confederation was at best equivocal. The Angrivarii's defection or revolt (defectio) in the middle of Arminius's renewed operations against the Teutoburg Forest must have been secured in advance by Germanicus.Annales ii.8 Even if it was not, a cavalry attack soon brought the Angrivarii's capitulation. Soon afterwards, however, they are back in alliance with the Cherusci and opposition to the Romans,Annales, ii.19 setting an ambush at the Cheruscan border, which was a high dirt embankment. They hid their cavalry in the woods and stationed their infantry on the reverse slope of the bank. The Romans had intelligence of the plan beforehand. They assaulted the embankment, preceding their assault with volleys from slings and spears thrown by machines. Driving the Angrivarii from the bank, they went on to pursue the cavalry in the woods. Once again the Angrivarii were totally routed. Once the Cherusci had been dealt with, Germanicus turned his attention to the Angrivarii.Annales ii.22 They, however, surrendered unconditionally to the general sent by Germanicus and placed themselves in the status of suppliants, begging for mercy, which Germanicus granted. This later reaped dividends for the Angrivarii played a major role in securing the return of ships and men lost in a North Sea storm which scattered the Roman fleet upon the shore of hostile or neutral Germanic tribes.Annales ii.24 Finally, on May 26 of the year 17, Germanicus celebrated a triumph for his victory over lower Germany and his uncle sent him off to the east.Annales ii.41 Arminius died and the Angrivarii, the other west Germans and their successor tribes continued friendly towards Rome, providing it with elite troops and urban and palace police.

Currently given the scientific name Kukulcania hibernalis, it was formerly known as Filistata hibernalis. Found in the Americas, it exhibits strong sexual dimorphism. It is occurs in the southern states of the USA, throughout Central America and some of the Caribbean, to southern Brazil and Uruguay. The males may be mistaken for brown recluses because the two have similar coloration and body structure. However, compared to the brown recluse, male southern house spiders are typically larger in size, lack the distinctive violin shape on their cephalothorax, and have unusually long slender pedipalps. The females are dark brown or black and more compact. Both sexes may grow to be roughly across (legs extended), with the males typically having longer legs, and the females often having larger, bulbous bodies. The abdomen of the southern house spider is covered with fine velvety light gray hair. Female southern house spiders are rarely seen, as they build radial webs around crevices, for which reason their family (Filistatidae) is called crevice weavers. Females seldom move except to capture prey caught in their webs. Males, on the other hand, typically wander in search of insects and females to mate with, having no particular territory. The southern house spider is a cribellate spider. That is, its spinnerets do not produce adhesive webbing. Instead, to capture prey the spider uses its legs to comb webbing across its cribellum, a spiked plate near the spinnerets. This combing action frays and tangles the strands, producing a fine, velcro-like netting that ensnares insect legs. Male southern house spiders sometimes appear aggressive, but they do not bite unless trapped, and their mouthparts are too small to easily penetrate human skin. They do, however, have an unnerving tendency to crawl across anything in their path regardless of whether it is alive. This is not aggression; these spiders are simply nearly blind and cannot see larger animals. Indeed, these spiders instinctively play dead if they feel threatened (a tactic which is effective against their common predators). Southern house spiders are capable of crawling through crevices as narrow as 1/4 in (0.66 cm) due to their elongated bodies and compact legs. Reproduction The southern house spider mating ritual is a lengthy (over an hour) and elaborate process with long periods during which neither the male nor the female moves considerably. When the wandering male encounters a female's web, there may be an initial confrontation where each scares the other. Upon recovering, the male then constructs a large web around the female's crevice. When this web is complete, the male pulls on its strands continuously to draw the female out of her hole, which may take several minutes. Following her emergence, each spider will tap at the other in an effort to grasp the other by the forelegs, with the male remaining suspended in his web.

The three-member Board was created as part of an expansion of the U.S. Navy Department at the end of the War of 1812. The system was implemented by Benjamin W. Crowninshield, Secretary of the Navy during the administrations of Presidents James Madison and James Monroe. Following the recommendations of William Jones, the establishment of the Board of Naval Commissioners by act of Congress on February 7, 1815 (3 Stat. 202), was the outgrowth of efforts to relieve the Secretary of the Navy of some of responsibilities connected with the civilian functions of the navy, so he could devote more time to overall administration. As naval warfare continued to increase in technical complexity, however, reformers began to consider that the three commissioners and a minimal staff were not enough to handle the navy's procurement needs. By the 1840s, it seemed that a functional approach was preferable‚Äîone which established bureaus or offices within the Navy Department to focus on specific areas such as shipbuilding or provisioning. This reform was finally achieved during the administration of President John Tyler, and implemented by his Secretary of the Navy Abel P. Upshur. An Act of Congress on August 31, 1842 abolished the Board of Naval Commissioners and established the \\"bureau system\\" in the Department of the Navy. This system, with modifications, lasted until the mid-1960s. Establishment and responsibilities The board had responsibility for the procurement of naval stores and materials; construction, armament, equipment, repair, and preservation of naval vessels; establishment of regulations to secure uniformity in the classes of naval vessels; preparation of estimates of expenditures for different parts of the naval service; and supervision of navy yards, naval stations, and navy agents. The Secretary of the Navy retained control over personnel and appointments, movement of ships, and other administrative matters not delegated to the board. As provided by the act, the board, attached to the Office of the Secretary, was composed of three post-captains appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; the ranking officer of the board was to be its president. The board was authorized to establish its own regulations and employ a secretary to keep a record of its proceedings and two clerks to assist in other office work. Each commissioner was to receive $3,500 a year in lieu of wages, rations, and other pay due him as a naval officer.  Personnel  = Board presidents = During its existence the board had five presidents. All held the courtesy rank of commodore; the rank of admiral did not come into existence until the American Civil War. # John Rodgers, 1815‚Äì1824; 1827‚Äì1837 # William Bainbridge, 1824‚Äì1827 # Isaac Chauncey, 1837‚Äì1840 # Charles Morris, 1840‚Äì1841 # Lewis Warrington, 1841‚Äì1842 Chauncey, Morris, and Warrington also served on the board prior to their appointments to its presidency.

Blue uniforms =1867 version= The tunic of the 1867 version uniform was dark blue. =Meiji 19 1886 version= Parade uniform of Japanese military attach√©, Major General Onodera Makoto, 1930s The Meiji 19 1886 version tunic was the dark blue, single-breasted, had a low standing collar and no pockets. It was worn with matching straight trousers and a kepi (red for Imperial Guard) on which was worn a brass five point star. After the Franco-Prussian War the kepi was replaced with a flat topped peaked cap and the tunic collar became higher. Pockets were added to officers' tunics late in its issue. Infantry uniforms had red facings on tunic collars, shoulder straps and trouser stripes. Line infantry had yellow bands and piping on their caps while the infantry of the Imperial Guard were distinguished by red. Trouser seams for both branches of the infantry had wide red stripes. Artillery had yellow facings on their dark blue uniforms. The branch colour for engineers was dark brown, green for medical and light blue for transport units. Finance, administration and other support services had white facings. A dark blue shako (red for Imperial Guard units) with a short white plume was worn for full dress. The ordinary duty and active service headdress was however a form of peaked cap with a narrow crown, somewhat resembling the French kepi of the period. A lightweight white cotton uniform was used for fatigue duties and tropical wear. In hot weather white trousers and cap covers were worn with the dark blue tunics. White canvas leggings were worn by non-mounted personnel with both white and blue uniforms until 1906. Senior officers could wear a longer, double-breasted version of the tunic in full dress. Other features included elaborate Austrian knots (gold braiding on the cuffs according to rank), waist sashes, gold shoulder cords and plumes on the dress kepi. For ordinary duties and active service officers of all ranks wore dark blue dolmans braided in black. In 1904 this was replaced by a dark blue tunic of simpler pattern. Cavalry regiments wore a short attila jacket with transverse hussar-style braiding in yellow (red for the cavalry of the Imperial Guard). Breeches were red. The cavalry branch colour was green and in 1905 this colour appeared on both collars and breeches stripes. As with the other branches of the Imperial Guard, the cavalry were distinguished by red bands and piping on their service caps. Red trousers were also worn by army bands and by the Military Police (Kenpeitai). The dark blue uniform adopted under the 1886 Regulations was retained with only minor modifications until 1905. As such it was worn during the early months of the Russo-Japanese War. A khaki summer uniform had been introduced shortly before the outbreak of war and this became general issue for front line infantry during June‚ÄìAugust 1904. Cavalry and artillery were subsequently issued with the new khaki uniform but some second line units continued to wear dark blue until the end of the War in September 1905. During the winter of 1904-05 the heavier blue uniforms were again worn but often under the loose fitting summer khaki drill for camouflage. The white canvas leggings continued to be worn without darkening, until after the war. Following the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese Army adopted khaki for all occasions ‚Äì the first major army to discard colourful parade dress. Only the cavalry squadrons of the Imperial Guard and officers of all branches were authorized to retain their coloured uniforms for certain ceremonial and social occasions, until 1939. Khaki uniforms Different types of Khaki uniforms =1904 enlisted khaki uniform= IJA General Kuroki and his Chief of Staff wearing the 1904 uniform during the Battle of Liaoyang. This was basically a khaki cotton version of the 1886 uniform with a shorter jacket. First appearing as a fatigue dress in 1900, it was being issued as a hot-weather uniform in 1904 to replace the white summer clothing described above. The practical advantages of khaki drill over dark blue became obvious in the opening stages of the Russo-Japanese War and it became general issue for troops on active service as stocks became available. In 1906 a khaki serge cold-weather uniform and greatcoat had also been adopted. =1911 (45 Shiki- Gun-i)= The 1911 or Type 45 uniform replaced the blue uniform with the exceptions noted above. The T45 khaki colored version (called khaki in the west the colour was actually a yellowish-brown called Ochre) of the blue uniform. The new flat topped peaked cap had a red band, the tunic collar had red swallow tailed gorget patches and the shoulders had red shoulder bars (see photograph opposite) to indicate rank. The uniform was produced in wool for winter and cotton for summer wear. Type Kai 45 The Type 45 was further updated in 1918 as the Type Kai 45. The term ‚ÄúKai‚Äù was to denote that it was a modification of the original Type 45 uniform. It was a change in sizing measurements. It was later modified with a change in material and discarding of the red piping on the uniforms. They were still being issued into the 30‚Äôs alongside the newer Type 5 uniforms. =M90 (5 Shiki-Gun-i)= The Showa Type 5, also called the M90 or 2590 or 1930 uniform, was basically the Type 45 uniform but introduced internal breast pockets with scalloped pocket flaps on the tunic for all ranks. It also featured a seam on the back not present in the Type 45 uniform as well as being made to the newly adopted metric measurements rather than in the old system of measurement. Also the straight trousers were later replaced with pantaloons which were worn with woolen spiral wound puttees and tapes. =M98 (98 Shiki-Gun-i)= The M98 (1938) was a further modification of the M90 uniform. The single breasted tunic (98 Shiki-Gun-i) had a stand and fall collar, five buttons which ran down the front and two, or more usually, four internal pockets with scalloped flaps (depending on the manufacturer). Long trousers or pantaloons (Bousyo-ko) were worn as standard along with the puttees (Kya-han) and tapes. All except mounted troops (who wore breeches and high leather boots) wore this uniform with horsehide, pigskin or leather ankle-boots. The boots (amiage-gutu) had either a hobnailed hard leather sole with metal heel J-cleat or a rubber sole with rubber cleats. When off duty, soldiers could wear tabis. A collarless wool or cotton white, grey or light green under shirt (Bousho Jyu-han) was worn under the tunic. This had one or two patch breast pockets with buttoned flaps, most had only a single pocket on the left breast. A khaki cotton shirt with stand and fall collar and two breast pockets could be worn in warm climates, with or without the tunic. The flat-topped peaked cap was replaced by a cloth field cap (Sen-bou) with a short leather or (more usually) cloth peak. Originally produced in khaki it was later produced in various shades of green ranging from grey-green to a dark green. The cap was more of a peaked sidecap and could be worn with a neck flap (Bou-tare), hooked to the bottom for sun protection, made from four cloth rectangles. =Type 3 (3 Shiki- Gun-i)= 3 Shiki-Gun-i The Type 3 was introduced in 1943 and was similar to the Type 98 but was made of cheaper materials. Type 3 uniforms for enlisted men also consisted of only 3 size options compared to the 6 size options for the Type 98. Type 3 trousers were also cut lower down the waist and the fastening hook was replaced with a button top instead. It also reintroduced cuff insignias for officers consisting of 1, 2, or 3 stripes of dark-brown braid on or above the cuff to indicate company, field, or general officers' grades respectively. It was produced in various shades of green. Officers could wear the uniform tunic open over a white or light green shirt with or without a black or green tie. =Officers' uniforms= General Makoto Onodera in officers' uniform. Officers were not usually issued uniforms so they had to procure their own, thus there was a wide variety in the details, colour and texture of their uniforms, with uniform colours ranging from tan (this case is modified Older Uniform. its started after Showa 13 rules(Êò≠Âíå13Âπ¥Âà∂Âºè) era) to dark green. Collars were taller and stiffer and materials were of a higher quality. Senior officers could procure and wear a double-breasted version of the blue and M90 uniforms. All ranks wore a single breasted version of the M98. Officers could wear straight trousers with their M98 uniforms as a walking out uniform and later they could also wear the tunic with the collar open over a white or grey green shirt. Headgear =Service hat= IJA service hat The service cap was the main cap of the Japanese army from the 1880's all the way into the 30's. The 1886 or Meiji 19 model was featured the dark blue crown and colored band depending on the branch. Such as standard infantry received yellow bands and Imperial Guard with red bands. The Type 45 olive service cap is a peaked cap similar in shape to that of the United States Army but with a smaller flatter crown and shorter visor. Red piping runs along the outer edge of the crown and the headband has a 1 1/2 inch wide red felt band. At the front of the red band is a gold star. The Imperial Guard service hat has a semicircular wreath of leaves below the star. The visor and chin strap are of black leather in standard military design.https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJA/HB/HB-11.html =Field cap= The Sen-bou is a cloth field cap with a short leather or (more usually) cloth peak. Originally produced in khaki it was later produced in various shades of green ranging from grey-green to a dark green. The cap was more of a peaked sidecap and could be worn with a neck flap (Bou-tare), hooked to the bottom for sun protection, made from four cloth rectangles =Metal helmets= *Adrian helmet ‚Äì As with many countries, the IJA adopted and produced the French Adrian helmet. The IJA version of the Adrian was a one piece helmet unlike that of the French version. In addition, the IJA Adrian featured tie chin straps similar to samurai kabuto fasteners. Later versions featured the star insignia in front of the helmet. It also featured a star shaped vent on the top of the helmet. *\\"Sakura\\" helmet ‚Äì A further improvement of the IJA Adrian. It featured a Sakura shaped vent cover on top of the vent holes above the helmet in order to prevent water and dirt from leaking into the helmet onto the soldiers' heads. *Type 92 ‚Äì The Adrian helmet was later replaced by a Japanese designed helmet called the Type 92 (1932). It was officially called tetsubo (steel cap) but was called tetsukabuto (\\"steel helmet\\") by troops. It was made in the shape of a dome with a short protruding rim all the way around it (the paratroop version only had a short brim in the front). This helmet was made of a thin inferior chrome-molybdenum steel with many proving to be very fragile, being easily pierced by shrapnel and/or gunfire. A star (or anchor for the IJN) was soldered to the front and the helmet and star were painted mustard khaki. They were sometimes whitewashed in the winter. A tan, khaki or olive-green two layer, fiber reinforced linen cover was available with a yellow star sewn on the front. The helmet was secured to the head by an elaborate set of straps descended from those of the Kabuto samurai helmet. It was also able to be worn over a reversed field cap. Camouflage nets were widely worn over the helmet especially in the Southern theatre and Pacific island campaign. =Tropical helmets= An IJA soldier wearing Type 90 helmet Type 90 helmet Type 90 helmet with uniform The IJA issues two types of tropical helmets to its troops: ** Type 90 ‚Äì It had a metal ventilator at the top, a couple of ventilation eyelets on either side and a brown leather chinstrap. ** Type 92 ‚Äì This was a cork version of the Type 92 steel helmet. It was covered with six segments of cloth, and several versions were available. It was issued to all ranks. Officers usually wore a white cover on theirs. Other items =Clothing= The IJA issued single-breasted cloaks, over coats, capes and raincoats with hoods in khaki.https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJA/HB/img/hb-11-1.jpg (U.S.) War Department TM-E30-480. Handbook on Japanese Military Forces, 15 September 1944, Chapter XI, Uniforms, Personal Equipment, and Insignia * JyubanUnderwear ‚Äì Jyuban are a part of the soldier's uniform as they were to be worn under the soldier's tunic and trousers. Jyuban were worn under the standard uniform as part of army regulation. White cotton jyuban were initially issued but then when a light-khaki (tan) was adopted, they were adapted as a work uniform. An olive-green version of the white fatigues was issued late in the Pacific War. An anti-heat jyuban was adopted and featured 3/4 sleeves and a collar. * Bousyo-i/Tropical ‚Äì The tropical cotton uniform, a design similar to the M98, was initially available in tan or light khaki, but was superseded later in the Pacific War by versions in medium to dark green. It featured open collars, buttoned side-vent flaps below the armpits, and pleated patch or internal pockets with flaps. Trousers could be full-length, 3/4 length, or a loose fitting breeches style pantaloon. Troops in the Pacific islands usually wore knee-length shorts with a lightweight cotton shirt which had three front buttons, 3/4-length sleeves and patch breast-pockets with flaps. Officers wore a short- or long-sleeved lightweight white (or off-white) tropical shirt with the green trousers, and when they wore the green tropical tunic they usually wore the shirt collar outside and over the tunic collar. * Kessenfuku (Ê±∫Êà¶Êúç/Êà¶ÊôÇÊúç (Decisive battle uniform) ‚Äì Introduced in 1945 the kessenfuku was meant for use defending the home islands if and when invaded. It consisted of a waist-length jacket with two hidden slash breast pockets, and two internal pockets with flaps. It also had a fold-down collar and reinforced elbows. Cheaper materials were used in fabrication with many variations in material and color. Both winter and summer weight variants were produced. * Imperial Guard ‚Äì Until 1939 the Cavalry of the Imperial Guard wore a French-style parade uniform consisting of a dark-blue tunic with red Brandenburg braiding, a red kepi and red breeches. The red kepi had a white plume with a red base. Off-duty members wore a dark blue tunic with 5 rows of black mohair froggings and dark blue breeches with a red stripe down each seam. Prior to the general adoption of khaki by the Japanese Army after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, an all-white linen uniform had been worn in hot weather. The Infantry of the Imperial Guard wore a dark blue uniform with white leggings for both parade and service wear until 1905. It was distinguished from that of the line infantry by a red band and piping on the peaked service-cap (instead of yellow). Following the adoption of a khaki service-dress the Guard Infantry wore this on all occasions. In the field the army's basic uniform was worn. It was worn with either a chrysanthemum or a star in a wreath. =Accessories= * Senninbari were red-sash 1,000 stitch belts worn around the waist of uniforms. They were supposed to bring good luck, confer courage, and make the wearer immune to bullets. * Hachimaki (Èâ¢Â∑ª) is a stylized headband (bandana) in Japanese culture, usually made of red or white cloth, and worn as a symbol of perseverance or effort by the wearer. * Shin gunt≈ç ‚Äì The shin gunt≈ç (Êñ∞ËªçÂàÄ?, \\"New Army Sword\\") was a weapon and badge of rank used by the Imperial Japanese Army between 1935 and 1945.

The Constitution of the German Empire (1871) was closely based on it. A Konstituierender Reichstag was elected on 12 February 1867. Its only task was to discuss and adopt the proposal for a constitution, as presented by the allied governments. The proposal was essentially written by Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian minister-president and first and only Bundeskanzler (the sole minister) of the Confederation. The Konstituierender Reichstag was dominated by national liberals and moderate conservatives. According to the theory of the time, the highest organ of the country was the Bundesrat (Federal Council). It represented the governments of the North German states. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes in the council, giving it the right of veto. By constitution, the King of Prussia (William I), was the holder of the Bundespr√§sidium, de facto the head of state. He installed the Bundeskanzler (Federal Chancellor), the federal executive. Besides the chancellor, there were no ministers. The Reichstag (although the country was called Bund) was the parliament, elected by all male north Germans above the age of 25. This was quite extraordinary in those times; Bismarck introduced this in the hope that it would create conservative majorities. Reichstag and council together had legislative powers, making the democratically elected Reichstag an important and powerful organ. After the Franco‚ÄìPrussian War of 1870/1871, the south German states Baden, Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg joined the confederation. It was renamed Deutsches Reich (German Empire), and the constitution of the confederation, with few changes, became the Constitution of the German Empire.

Bird/Mary Heinlein Fruit & Spice Park, is a 37-acre park located in the heart of Redland, Florida and is the only botanical garden of its kind in the United States. This park is operated by Miami-Dade County Parks and Open Spaces Department. The park in itself attracts more than 50,000 visitors a year because of its unique agricultural environment. The garden features more than 500 different types of international exotic fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices. Visitors are allowed to sample fallen fruits, enjoy lunch at the Mango Cafe, or schedule a tour of the park. History The Redland area, part of southern Miami-Dade County, has always been known for its many farms, unique ability to grow fresh fruit, and its reddish soil. Mary Calkins Heinlein was the daughter of pioneer sub-tropical farmers and had always had a passion for fruits and gardens in South Florida. She had a goal to showcase the Redland and its rich agricultural environment. In 1935, she got in contact with county commissioners and pioneer Parks Director to begin multiple transactions to purchase 18 acres in the Redland. County commissioner Preston B. Bird finalized the deal in 1943 and received ownership for the land with Heinlein. South Date County's Park Development Department signed a contract with William Lyman Philips to develop the vision that Heinlein had for the garden. In 1944, construction began and Heinlein was named Superintendent. The garden featured many different fruits and agricultural developments that Heinlein had hoped for. It even showcased two historical structures: the original Redland Schoolhouse and a coral rock building. After inspiring the creation of the garden and naming it the Redland Fruit and Spice Park, Heinlein's 10-year reign ended in 1959 when she retired as Superintendent. She continued to stay an active garden club member and develop insights on the different fruits that should be planted until she died in 1979. In memory of her and Preston B. Bird, the county renamed the Redland Fruit and Spice Park to the Preston B. Bird/Mary Heinlein Fruit & Spice Park in 1980. Exhibits \\"Mango Row\\" along southern border of park The park contains more than 500 varieties of fruits, nuts, and spice trees. It also includes more than 80 banana trees, 160 varieties of mango trees, more than 40 varieties of grape trees, and 70 varieties of bamboo trees. It also features guava, jackfruit, canistel, sapodilla, longan, lychee, mamey and black sapote, miracle fruit, jaboticaba, and coffee beans. Visitors are allowed to sample these fruits once they have fallen on the ground, but they are not allowed to pick them up off the trees. The park also features guided tours that will take you around the park and show you all that it has to offer. The tours are available every day at 11 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3 p.m. Private tours are also available for school or club field trips. Facilities Entrance requires an admission fee of $10 per adult and $3 per child, but the entrance has a store open to the public where many fruits from the park can be sampled for free. A tram is available with a guide for free once inside the park. It leaves from nearby the spice garden. The park includes a cafe. The entrance hall has a large library of gardening books, spices, honey, jams, jellies, and souvenirs for sale.

Two of the legends are found in the Poetic Edda, and the Hervarar saga can be seen as a compilation of these legends. The forging and the curse The first part deals with the forging of the sword Tyrfing by the Dwarves Durin and Dvalin. They are forced to do so by Svafrlami, the king of Gardariki, but in revenge they curse the sword so that it will kill a man every time it is unsheathed, cause three evil deeds and be the undoing of Svarflami. Svafrlami is killed in single combat with the berserker Arngrim, who takes the sword and gives it to his son Angantyr. The Battle on Sams√∏ The second part deals with the legend of Hjalmar, Orvar-Odd and the duel on Sams√∏. Arngrim's twelve sons meet Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd in a duel, but the outnumbered heroes kill Arngrim's sons. However, Hjalmar has been wounded by Tyrfing and dies. Hervor The third part deals with Angantyr's daughter Hervor and how she reclaims Tyrfing from her father's ghost. Later she marries and has the sons Angantyr and Heidrek. Heidrek The fourth part deals with the saga of Heidrek the wise, the king of the Goths, and contains the riddles of Gestumblindi. If the killing of Hjalmar may be the sword's first evil deed, its second is the accidental slaying of Heidrek's brother Angantyr. The third and last evil deed is probably when Heidrek's slaves murder Heidrek during an expedition in the Carpathians. The Battle of the Goths and the Huns The fifth part is about Heidrek's sons Angantyr and Hl√∂d and how Hl√∂d invades the land of the Goths with the Hunnish horde. The history of Sweden The last part is about Swedish history and its line of Swedish kings from Ivar Vidfamne until king Philip Halstensson.

(Memorial Day, July 1, 1924) The National War Memorial in St. John's, Newfoundland The National War Memorial in Downtown St. John's is the most elaborate of all the post World War I monuments in Newfoundland and Labrador. It was erected at King's Beach on Water Street where, in 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland for England. It was formally unveiled on Memorial Day, July 1, 1924 by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig. The Great War Veterans' Association and the Newfoundland Patriotic Association launched the campaign to have the National War Memorial established. They developed a committee to establish the design and undertake the fund-raising to pay for the proposed memorial. Construction of the memorial was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel Father Thomas Nangle, the Roman Catholic Padre of Royal Newfoundland Regiment and (Ret) Captain Gerald (Gerry) Whitty Design The design was semi-circular with a graduated plateau rising from the entrance stairway on Water Street to the cenotaph on Duckworth Street. The five figures were designed by two English sculptors, Ferdinand Victor Blundstone (top and sides) and Gilbert Bayes (front), and were cast in bronze by E.J. Parlanti from London, England. These figures represent Newfoundland's involvement in World War I. At the top of the central pedestal is a figure of a woman. It symbolizes Newfoundland's willingness to serve and the spirit of loyalty to the Empire. She is holding a flaming torch in her left hand as a symbol of freedom.

It was investigated by Edward Frankland and (for over six years) by Robert Bunsen and is considered the earliest organometallic compound ever discovered (even though arsenic is not a true metal). From it other compounds were made, such as cacodyl fluoride, chloride, et cetera. One compound, cacodyl cyanide, was particularly awful. In Bunsen's words \\"the smell of this body produces instantaneous tingling of the hands and feet, and even giddiness and insensibility...It is remarkable that when one is exposed to the smell of these compounds the tongue becomes covered with a black coating, even when no further evil effects are noticeable\\". Work on cacodyl led Bunsen to the postulation of \\"methyl radicals\\" as part of the then-current radical theory. Applications Cacodyl was used to try to prove the radical theory of J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius, which resulted in a wide use of cacodyl in research laboratories. Afterward interest in the toxic, malodorous compound decreased. During World War I the use of cacodyl as chemical weapon was considered, but it was never used in the war. Inorganic chemists discovered the properties of cacodyl as a ligand for transition metals.

The other system is the binational TAZARA Railway (TAZARA) that interconnects with the ZR at Kapiri Mposhi and provides a link to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam. History Part of the railway near Kabwe under construction The gauge Cape gauge ZR network was built during British colonial rule as part of the vision of the Cape-Cairo railway but the economic spur was to access the mines of Central Africa. The railway started as part of Rhodesia Railways, the company which ran the railways of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia as an integrated operation, which was one of the largest employers and enterprises in both countries. The railway arrived in the future Zambia early in 1905 when the 150 km Livingstone-Kalomo line was built in advance of completion in September of that year of the Victoria Falls Bridge from the then Southern Rhodesia to Livingstone. The first wagons on the line were hauled by oxen, then a single locomotive was conveyed in pieces by cableway across the gorge where the bridge was being built to start up operations to Kalomo in advance of the main line connection.Horizon magazine: \\"Zambia's Second Industry\\", February 1965, pp4-11. Another major bridge was required to cross the Kafue River and the 427 m long Kafue Railway Bridge, the longest on the Rhodesia Railways or Zambian Railways network, was completed in 1906. The line reached Broken Hill (Kabwe) in 1906 and Ndola in the Copperbelt in 1909 (connecting to Sakania in the Belgian Congo), some 20 years before the first large-scale copper mines opened there. Zambia Railways operates the Mulobezi Railway, a branch line from Livingstone, built as a private timber line. In the mid-1960s, spurred by the Rhodesian UDI crisis, the newly independent Zambia split its railways off from Rhodesia Railways, and Zambia Railways came into being. Railway Systems of Zambia Railway Systems of Zambia Limited (RSZ) is a private company incorporated and registered in Zambia. It is a subsidiary of NLPI Ltd (NLPI), an investment holding company. The NLPI Consortium participated in a tender in respect of the Zambia Railways Concession. The Consortium was declared the winner with the signing of the Freight Concession Agreement on 14 February 2003. The Concession was to operate for a period of 20 years with a possible extension for a further 10 years. However, in September 2012, the government revoked the concession and Zambia Railways resumed control. International links There are no current international passenger services of the ZR, only of the TAZARA railway. Some tour companies have run special services on the ZR network. =Democratic Republic of the Congo= The Copperbelt reaches into the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with mines at Lubumbashi and further north-west. The ZR network connects to Lubumbashi via Ndola and Sakania. At one time the Lubumbashi line connected to the Benguela Railway through Angola to Lobito Bay, but the line did not operate from the 1970s, until reopening in 2018. =TAZARA Railway= Kapiri Mposhi station As most of its major export routes ran through then apartheid controlled South Africa, Zambia needed an alternate export route for its copper. In 1976, Chinese construction crews completed the 1,860-kilometer-long Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) which runs from Kapiri Mposhi just north of the Zambian capital Lusaka, to the Tanzanian capital and major east African port of Dar es Salaam. After being operated jointly by the two nationalised railway systems, the Chinese again took over the running of TAZARA in a joint transport agreement from January 2007, which covered both direct air links to Beijing Capital International Airport and copper ore export. =Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa= A freight train crosses the Victoria Falls bridge into Zambia from Zimbabwe, 2006 Via Victoria Falls Bridge the Zimbabwe rail network and the ports in Mozambique (Beira, Maputo) and the South African Railways of South Africa can be reached. The condition of the 100-year-old bridge restricts traffic. Up to the mid-1960s, passenger and sleeper services ran from Ndola to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), connecting with a sleeper service to Cape Town and the Union Castle shipping line to Southampton, UK. This was the main travel route between south-central Africa and Europe before the Jet age. The journey from Ndola to Cape Town took five days. Ndola-Bulawayo passenger services ended when Zambia suspended all services across the Victoria Falls Bridge in response to Rhodesia's UDI crisis. Freight services were occasionally resumed up to the line re-opening in 1980, but successful passenger services have not resumed. =Mozambique and Malawi= A rail link to the Sena railway between Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, allowing access to the port of Nacala, was first planned in 1982. On the Malawi side of the border, the line to Mchinji was finished in 1984, but a connection to Chipata in Zambia was only opened in 2010. This line remains idle because there are few facilities at Chipata.

The Decretum Gratiani, also known as the Concordia discordantium canonum or Concordantia discordantium canonum or simply as the Decretum, is a collection of canon law compiled and written in the 12th century as a legal textbook by the jurist known as Gratian. It forms the first part of the collection of six legal texts, which together became known as the Corpus Juris Canonici. It was used by canonists of the Roman Catholic Church until the Decretals, promulgated by Pope Gregory IX in 1234, obtained legal force. Overview Around 1150 Gratian, teacher of theology at the monastery of Saints Nabor and Felix and sometimes believed to have been a Camaldolese monk, composed the work he called Concordia discordantium canonum, and others titled Nova collectio, Decreta, Corpus juris canonici, or the more commonly accepted name, Decretum Gratiani. He did this to obviate the difficulties which beset the study of practical, external theology (theologia practica externa), i.e., the study of canon law. In spite of its great reputation and wide diffusion, the Decretum has never been recognized by the Church as an official collection. It is divided into three parts (ministeria, negotia, sacramenta). The first part is divided into 101 distinctions (distinctiones), the first 20 of which form an introduction to the general principles of canon Law (tractatus decretalium); the remainder constitutes a tractatus ordinandorum, relative to ecclesiastical persons and function. The second part contains 36 causes (caus√¶), divided into questions (qu√¶stiones), and treat of ecclesiastical administration and marriage; the third question of the 33rd causa treats of the Sacrament of Penance and is divided into 7 distinctions. The third part De consecratione treats of the sacraments and other sacred things and contains 5 distinctions. Each distinction or question contains dicta Gratiani, or maxims of Gratian, and canones. Gratian himself raises questions and brings forward difficulties, which he answers by quoting auctoritates, i. e. canons of councils, decretals of the popes, texts of the Scripture or of the Fathers. These are the canones; the entire remaining portion, even the summaries of the canons and the chronological indications, are called the maxims or dicta Gratiani. Many auctoritates have been inserted in the Decretum by authors of a later date. These are the Pale≈ì, so called from Paucapalea, the name of the principal commentator on the Decretum. The Roman revisers of the 16th century (1566‚Äì82) corrected the text of the \\"Decree\\" and added many critical notes designated by the words Correctores Romani. The Decretum is quoted by indicating the number of the canon and that of the distinction or of the cause and the question. To differentiate the distinctions of the first part from those of the third, question of the 33rd cause of the second part and those of the third part, the words de P≈ìn., i. e. de P≈ìnitenti√¢, and de Cons., i. e. de Consecratione are added to the latter. For instance, \\"c. 1. d. XI\\" indicates the first part of the \\"Decree\\". distinction XI, canon 1; \\"c. 1., de P≈ìn., d. VI,\\" refers to the second part, 33rd cause, question 3, distinction VI, canon 1; \\"c. 8, de Cons., d. II\\" refers to the third part, distinction II, canon 8; \\"c. 8, C. XII, q. 3\\" refers to the second part, cause XII, question 3, canon 8. Sometimes, especially in the case of well-known and much-quoted canons, the first words are also indicated, e. g., c. Si quis suadente diabolo, C. XVII, q. 4, i. e. the 29th canon of the second part, cause XVII, question 4. Occasionally the first words alone are quoted. In both cases, to find the canon it is necessary to consult the alphabetical tables (printed in all editions of Gratian) that contain the first words of every canon. Author Gratian Gratian () was a canon lawyer from Bologna. He flourished in the mid 12th century. Little else is known about him. He is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Franciscus Gratianus,\\" Johannes Gratian,Van Hove, Alphonse. \\"Johannes Gratian\\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia, . Robert Appleton Co. (New York), 1909. Accessed 19 Sept. 2014. or Giovanni Graziano. For a long time he was believed to have been born at the end of the 11th century, at Chiusi in Tuscany. He was said to have become a monk at Camaldoli and then taught at the monastery of St. Felix in Bologna and devoted his life to studying canon law, but contemporary scholarship does not attach credibility to these traditions.* Since the 11th century, Bologna had been the centre of the study of canon law, as well as of Roman law, after the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered in western Europe. Gratian's work was an attempt, using early scholastic method, to reconcile seemingly contradictory canons from previous centuries. Gratian quoted a great number of authorities, including the Bible, papal and conciliar legislation, church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo, and secular law in his efforts to reconcile the canons. Gratian found a place in Dante's Paradise among the doctors of the Church:University of Texas at Austin, accessed June-25-2013 He has long been acclaimed as Pater Juris Canonici (Latin, \\"Father of Canon Law\\"), a title he shares with his successor St. Raymond of Penyafort. Textual history The vulgate version of Gratian's collection was completed at some point after the Second Council of the Lateran of 1139, which it quotes. Research by Anders Winroth established that some manuscripts of an early version of Gratian's text, which differs considerably from the mainstream textual tradition, have survived.Winroth (Cambridge 2004), 138 With later commentaries and supplements, the work was incorporated into the Corpus Juris Canonici. The Decretum quickly became the standard textbook for students of canon law throughout Europe, but it never received any formal, official recognition by the papacy. Only the Codex Juris Canonici of 1917 put it out of use.Crompton (2006):174 As late as 1997, scholars commonly set the date of completion at 1140, but this accuracy in dating isn't possible after Anders Winroth's groundbreaking scholarship.Hartmann & Pennington, History of Medieval Canon Law in the Classical Period, pg. 7. Research by Anders Winroth shows that the Decretum existed in two published recensions.Winroth, (Cambridge, 2004), 3 The first dates to sometime after 1139, while the second dates to 1150 at the latest. There are several major differences between the two recensions: *The first recension is a more coherent and analytical work. *The second recension places a much greater emphasis on papal primacy and power. *The second recension includes Roman law extracts taken directly from the Corpus Juris Civilis, whereas the first recension does not demonstrate substantial familiarity with Roman jurisprudence. These differences led Winroth to conclude that Roman law was not as far developed by 1140 as scholars had previously thought. He has also argued that the second recension was due not to the original author of the first recension (whom he calls Gratian 1), but rather another jurist versed in Roman law.Winroth, (Cambridge, 2004), 146-74 However, Winroth's thesis of two Gratians remains controversial.See most recently Atria Larson, Master of Penance: Gratian and the Development of Penitential Thought and Law, ca. 1120-1215, Washington, DC: Catholic University Press, 2013, arguing for even greater complexity in the addition and adaptation of the text of the Decretum. An illustration from a 13th-century manuscript of the work, illustrating the kinds of blood relatives and common ancestry which made marriage impossible and contracted marriages null. It has since then been changed so third cousins can now marry. This field of inquiry is hampered by ignorance of the compiler's identity and the existence of manuscripts with abbreviated versions of the text or variant versions not represented by Winroth's two recensions. One of these is the manuscript St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek, 673 (=Sg), which some have argued contains the earliest known version (borrador) of the Decretum,Carlos Larrainzar, ‚ÄòEl borrador de la ‚ÄúConcordia‚Äù de Graciano: Sankt Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek MS 673 (=Sg)‚Äô, Ius Ecclesiae: Rivista internazionale di diritto canonico 11 (1999): 593-666 but which other scholars have argued contains an abbreviation of the first recension expanded with texts taken from the second recension.Titus Lenherr, \\"Ist die Handschrift 673 der St. Galler Stiftsbibliothek (Sg) der Entwurf zu Gratians Dekret?: Versuch einer Antwort aus Beobachtungen an D.31 und D.32\\" (unpublished paper) ; Anders Winroth, ‚ÄúRecent Work on the Making of Gratian‚Äôs Decretum,‚Äù Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law, n.s. 26 (2004-2006): 1-29; John Wei, ‚ÄúA Reconsideration of St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) in light of the Sources of Distinctions 5-7 of the De penitentia,‚Äù Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law, n.s. 27 (2007): 141-80.  Sources  Gratian's sources were Roman law, the Bible, the writings of (or attributed to) the Church Fathers, papal decretals, the acts of church councils and synods. In most cases, Gratian obtained the material not from a direct reading of the sources but rather through intermediate collections. Thanks to the research of modern scholars (in particular Charles Munier, Titus Lenherr, and Peter Landau) it is now known that Gratian made use of a relatively-small number of collections in the composition of most of the Decretum: *Anselm (II) of Lucca‚Äôs canonical collection, originally compiled around 1083 and existing in four main recensions: A, B, Bb, and C. Peter Landau suggests that Gratian probably employed a manuscript containing an expanded form of recension A which he calls recension A‚Äô; *the Collectio tripartita attributed to Ivo of Chartres, usually thought to date to 1095; *the Panormia of Ivo of Chartres, also usually dated to 1095, although several scholars have argued for a later date and some even question Ivo's authorship; *Gregory of St. Grisogono's Polycarpus, completed some time after 1111; *the Collection in Three Books, composed some time between 1111 and 1139, though dated by some to around 1123; *the Glossa ordinaria to the Bible. Other sources are known to have been used in the composition of particular sections of the Decretum: *Isidore of Seville's Etymologies for DD. 1-9 (the so-called Treatise on Laws); *Alger of Li√®ge's Liber de misericordia et iustitia for C. 1; *the Sententiae magistri A. for the De penitentia and some other sections.  Effect  Ghent University Library. Gratian himself named his work Concordia Discordantium Canonum ‚Äì \\"Concord of Discordancies of Canons.\\" The name is fitting: Gratian tried to harmonize apparently contradictory canons with each other, by discussing different interpretations and deciding on a solution. This dialectical approach allowed for other law professors to work with the Decretum and to develop their own solutions and commentaries. These legists are known as the decretists. These commentaries were called glosses. Editions printed in the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries frequently included the glosses along with the text. Collections of glosses were called \\"gloss apparatus\\" or Lectura in Decretum (see also glossator). Systematic commentaries were called Summae. Some of these Summae were soon in circulation as well and obtained the same level of fame as the Decretum itself. Early commentators included Paucapalea and Magister Rolandus. The most important commentators were probably Rufin of Bologna (died before 1192) and Huguccio (died 1210). Less well-known was the commentary of Simon of Bisignano, which consisted of the Glosses on the Decretum and the Summa Simonis. Peter Lombard borrowed and adapted from the Decretum when discussing penance in his Sentences (~1150).See Appendix B in Larson, Master of Penance. =Importance to Western law= The Decretum served as a model for 12th-century jurists in the formation of Western law, based on rational rules and evidence to replace barbaric laws which often involved trial by ordeal or battle. The Decretum has been called \\"the first comprehensive and systematic legal treatise in the history of the West, and perhaps in the history of mankind ‚Äì if by 'comprehensive' is meant the attempt to embrace virtually the entire law of a given polity, and if by 'systematic' is meant the express effort to codify that law as a single body, in which all parts are viewed as interacting to form a whole.\\" The Decretum made a direct contribution to the development of Western law in areas that it dealt with such as marriage, property and inheritance. Specific concepts included consent for marriage, and wrongful intent in determining whether a certain act constituted a crime.  References  =Bibliography= *Brundage, James.

Holland was lost when he stayed at his post during the sinking of HMS Hood. Early life Lancelot Holland was one of six sons and a daughter of a doctor who was also a brewer for the firm Hunt Edmunds. He was born in Middleton Cheney and was raised in the Banbury area. He entered the Royal Navy on 15 May 1902. On leaving HMS Britannia in September 1903, he was drafted to the China Station to join HMS Eclipse. He served in the Far East until August 1905. The latter part of his time there was spent in HMS Hampshire. Returning home, he saw brief service during the summer of 1908 in the Admiralty surveying ship HMS Research. However, the surveying service proved not to be Holland's forte and three years later on 14 September 1911 the young Lieutenant Holland joined HMS Excellent, the Royal Navy's gunnery school at Whale Island, Portsmouth to start the 'Long Course' which would qualify him as a lieutenant (G). Having qualified as a gunnery lieutenant and gone on to take the advanced gunnery course at Greenwich, Holland spent the First World War in a teaching role aboard HMS Excellent. After the war he was promoted to commander on 31 December 1919 and captain on 30 June 1926. During the period May 1929 to February 1931, Holland was flag captain to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, aboard HMS Hawkins. From May 1931 to September 1932, Holland headed the British Naval Mission to Greece. He was subsequently flag captain aboard the battleship HMS Revenge from July 1934 to July 1935. Senior officer After a 1937 stint as naval ADC to King George VI, he was promoted to Rear admiral and became commander of the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in January 1938, flying his flag in HMS Resolution and then commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron, in August 1939 he was appointed Rear-Admiral, Commanding, Channel Force in September 1939. He then became Admiralty representative at the Air Ministry. He was promoted to Vice Admiral backdated to Aug 1940 http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php/Lancelot_Ernest_Holland after commanding Cruiser Force H during the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 Nov 1940. Second World War From July 1940, Holland commanded the 7th Cruiser Squadron, serving in the Mediterranean. During the course of this command he led his cruisers in the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940. By this time, Holland had established himself as a gunnery specialist. =The North Atlantic and nemesis= Holland's next assignment was in command of the Battlecruiser Squadron. In May 1941, the new German battleship Bismarck attempted to break out into the North Atlantic, accompanied by the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen. Their mission was to attack Allied convoys. Holland flew his flag aboard Hood, which was accompanied by the new battleship HMS Prince of Wales. On 22 May, just after midnight, Electra, Achates, Antelope, Anthony, Echo, and Icarus, escorting the Hood and Prince Of Wales, sailed to cover the northern approaches. The intention was that the force would refuel in Hvalfjord, Iceland, and then sail again to watch the Denmark Strait. On the evening of 23 May, the weather deteriorated. At 20:55, Admiral Holland aboard the Hood signalled the destroyers \\"If you are unable to maintain this speed I will have to go on without you. You should follow at your best speed.\\" At 02:15 on the morning of 24 May, the destroyers were ordered to spread out at 15 mile intervals to search to the north. At about 05:35, the German forces were sighted by the Hood and, shortly afterwards, the Germans sighted the British ships. In the ensuing Battle of the Denmark Strait the Hood suffered a catastrophic magazine explosion at 06:01 that broke the ship in half; the admiral and all but three of the crew of 1,418 were lost. One of the survivors, Ted Briggs, later stated he last saw Holland sitting in his admiral's chair, in utter dejection, making no attempt to escape from the sinking wreck.Hood and Bismarck by David Mearns and Rob White Prince of Wales made her escape with some damage, including a hit on her bridge which killed many of her officers. One of the salvos from Prince of Wales damaged Bismarcks fuel tanks, and prompted her to make for occupied France. Holland was posthumously Mentioned in Despatches. Family The Admiral Holland public house, Banbury Admiral Holland was married to Phyllis and had one son, John, who died of polio at the age of 18 in 1935. Admiral Holland and his family attended the Anglican parish Church of St John the Baptist at Boldre in the New Forest, Hampshire, England. They had a memorial to their son installed there and later a Hood Memorial Chapel was dedicated. An annual memorial service is held to remember Admiral Holland and the crew of the Hood. A public house in Banbury, The Admiral Holland, was named after him. This pub was demolished in May 2017. References Bibliography * Pursuit: The Sinking of the Bismarck, Ludovic Kennedy.

It is situated on the north flank of Aspen Mountain (for which it is named) at an elevation of . Aspen Mountain forms the end of Richmond Ridge, a long ridge that extends 10 miles south at approximately to join the main spine of the Elk Mountains. Founded in 1946 by Walter Paepcke, Aspen was the first ski area venture of the Aspen Skiing Company. It is one of four adjacent ski areas operated by the company as part of the Aspen/Snowmass complex. At only , it is somewhat small compared to other ski areas, especially compared to the much larger nearby Snowmass ski area, and retains a unique cultural flavor that harkens to the earlier days of recreational skiing in the state. The ski area is located within the White River National Forest and is operated under permit from the U.S. Forest Service. It has three restaurants on the mountain; two are on top (one of which is a club that only allows members) and one mid-mountain. History and description View of downtown Aspen from the Silver Queen Gondola on Aspen Mountain Prior to 1946, the mountain had been the site of skiing using a crude boat lift, and by the use of the jeep trails up the back side of the mountain on Midnight Mine Road. In 1941, Aspen's first national downhill and slalom championships were held March 8‚Äì9. Fritz Benedict visited Aspen for the first time, the father of the 10th Mountain Hut and Trail System. The foundation of the ski area in 1946 was accomplished with the installation of the single-seat chairlift, Lift-1. When it began operations on December 14, 1946, it was the longest chairlift in the world. Many of the first employees were veterans of the 10th Mountain Division, which had trained at Camp Hale, including Friedl Pfeifer of Austria and Pete Seibert. Before the war, Pfeifer had headed the ski school at Sun Valley and did the same at Aspen; Seibert was a member of the Aspen ski patrol would later found Vail Mountain (in 1962). In its fourth season, Aspen hosted the 1950 World Championships, the first world championships held outside of Europe, and the first since 1939. Lift-1 ran until 1972, when it was replaced by two double chairlifts, Shadow Mountain (commonly referred to as 1A) and Ruthie's. Access to the mountain was radically changed in 1986 with the installation of the Silver Queen Gondola, which ascends to the summit up the east side of the area with a vertical rise of . The area's lifts also include 1 high-speed quad, 1 high-speed double, 2 quads, and 3 doubles. The gondola is one of two lifts, along with the Little Nell chairlift, which ascend from Gondola Plaza in the heart of the downtown Aspen. The configuration allows visitors to ascend the mountain from the center of town, and ski down the Little Nell Run back into town. The mountainside contains hidden and open remains of the intense silver mining activity from the Colorado Silver Boom in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In January 2001, it was decided to end Aspen Mountain's long-time ban on snowboarding. However, as a courtesy to season-pass holders, the resort was not officially opened to snowboarders until April 1, 2001. The longest run is 3 miles (4.8 km) and the lift capacity is 10,755 riders per hour. The average annual snowfall is 300 inches (7.6 m). It has snowmaking capabilities of 210 acres (0.84 km¬≤), which comprises approximately one-third of the area. The mountain is considered moderate-to-difficult with no \\"green\\" (beginner) runs. Its sister mountain, Aspen Highlands, also has no beginner terrain as of December 2017. Novice skiers must go to Snowmass or Buttermilk. Approximately 26% of the terrain is considered expert. The season on the mountain ranges from late November to early April. It is typically the last area, along with nearby Snowmass, in the resort complex to close for the winter. The ski area has a unique \\"homespun\\" culture that dates from its early foundation as part of the Utopian social experiment in Aspen created by Walter Paepcke in the 1940s, retaining somewhat of a throwback culture in comparison to the other three areas of the complex. The culture is reflected in the numerous homemade memorials and tributes that dot the trees of mountains created in honor of famous personages such as John Denver and Hunter S. Thompson. It is rumored that under the Bell Mountain lift on Aspen Mountain was the home of the first Panty tree of bras, panties, thongs, and Mardi Gras necklaces as early as the late 1950s.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1995 to 2000 under the ring name Prince Iaukea and later The Artist Formerly Known as Prince Iaukea or simply The Artist. Hayner made his WCW debut in 1996 and mainly competed as a fan favorite underdog. He was utilized as an enhancement talent during the early months of his career before winning the World Television Championship in 1997 and holding the title for nearly two months. Hayner then fell into the ranks due to some issues with management before being repackaged as \\"The Artist\\". He dominated the cruiserweight division during the first half of 2000, winning the company's Cruiserweight Championship twice before departing the company later that year. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling= Training and debut (1995-1996) After being trained by Dean Malenko and Rico Federico, Hayner made his first appearance in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at the 1995 Fall Brawl pay-per-view as a cadet delivering papers to Cobra for Craig Pittman. Later, Kevin Sullivan brought him to some television tapings and was so impressed by his professionalism, overall attitude, and respect for the business that Sullivan gave him the \\"Iaukea\\" name taken from King Curtis Iaukea, a good friend of Sullivan. Hayner was thus given the ring name \\"Prince Iaukea\\". Hayner made his first appearance in WCW on the May 18, 1996 episode of Saturday Night, where he teamed with Rick Fargo as enhancement talents against Chris Benoit and Kevin Sullivan. He made his official television debut as the fan favorite \\"Prince Iaukea\\" on the June 1 episode of Saturday Night, where he defeated The Gambler. Two days later, Iaukea made his Monday Nitro debut with a loss to Kevin Sullivan and then remained a jobber to the stars for the remainder of the year. He made his pay- per-view debut at November's World War 3 as a participant in the World War 3 battle royal for a future title shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win. He quickly made a name for himself with his unique Samoan persona and real submission wrestling skills along with solid pro wrestling ability. The common pronunciation of his ring name came about by the mispronunciation from WCW announcer Tony Schiavone. Prince Iaukea also received blessing from King Curtis Iaukea during a phone conversation with King Curtis telling him that \\"he was family\\" and that he enjoyed the work that Prince was doing.  World Television Champion and struggle phase (1997-1998)  On the February 17, 1997 episode of Nitro, Iaukea captured the World Television Championship by defeating Lord Steven Regal after capitalizing on a distraction caused by Regal's scheduled pay-per-view opponent Rey Misterio, Jr. Iaukea successfully defended the title against Misterio, six days later at February's SuperBrawl VII and Uncensored. Iaukea began feuding with Regal and made a successful title defense against Regal at Spring Stampede, but was assaulted by Regal after the match. The following night, on Nitro, Iaukea attempted to rescue Misterio from an assault by Regal but ended up suffering a Regal Stretch and suffered a rib injury, leading him to drop the title to √öltimo Drag√≥n later that night. After his title loss, Iaukea received a title shot against Syxx for the Cruiserweight Championship and unsuccessfully tried to regain the World Television Championship from Lord Steven Regal on the May 19 episode of Nitro and √öltimo Drag√≥n on the July 28 episode of Nitro. Hayner continued to compete as a mid-carder before going on tour with WCW's working partner New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) during the month of October, where he competed with established greats such as Shinjiro Otani and Koji Kanemoto. NJPW booker Riki Choshu was a huge supporter of Hayner. Hayner returned to WCW television as a participant in the World War 3 at the eponymous pay-per-view on November 23. He would then float around the lower mid-card for several years, mainly because of an alleged romantic link between Hayner and the wife of an upper level WCW executive. Hayner denied the allegations, but the rumor persisted. He briefly feuded with Chris Jericho in early 1998 due to Jericho degrading Hayner's trainer Dean Malenko and Hayner stepped in to defend Malenko's honor. He unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the Cruiserweight Championship at Spring Stampede. After the match, Jericho stole Iaukea's Hawaiian dress. He went on a hiatus and returned to the company on the October 8 episode of Thunder against Kanyon in a losing effort. He then lost to Norman Smiley at the company's premier pay-per-view Starrcade on December 27, 1998.  The Artist and Cruiserweight Champion (1999-2000)  After spending most of 1999 as a low-carder and being left off pay-per-view events, Hayner was repackaged as a villain on the December 6, 1999 episode of Monday Nitro as \\"The Artist Formerly Known as Prince Iaukea\\", a character based on singer Prince. He was soon then given a valet named Paisley and his ring name was shortened to simply \\"The Artist\\". In 2000, Artist entered a tournament for the vacant Cruiserweight Championship. He defeated Kid Romeo, Kaz Hayashi and Lash LeRoux at SuperBrawl 2000 to win the vacant title. Artist successfully defended the title against Psychosis at the following month's Uncensored pay-per-view, before losing the title to Billy Kidman at a live event on March 30, only to regain it from Kidman on March 31. All the WCW titles were vacated by Vince Russo on April 10 when Russo and Eric Bischoff \\"re-launched\\" WCW. The Artist was then placed in a six-way match for the vacant title at Spring Stampede, in which he was pinned by Chris Candido. As a result, Artist began a rivalry with Candido and received a title shot at Slamboree, where he failed to win the title. This would be Hayner's last pay- per-view appearance in the company. Hayner was released in August 2000, his last televised match being a loss to Big Vito on the August 19 episode of WorldWide. =Independent circuit (2000-present)= Following his WCW release he wrestled the independent scene traveling around the country for various promotions. He was briefly known as The Tongan Prince for Jimmy Hart's X Wrestling Federation, but when that went under he used his military background and went to work for a security contractor overseas. In 2007 he started 3SX Entertainment (Samoan Strong Style Xtreme Wrestling and Entertainment) in American Samoa where work on a Pro Wrestling and MMA Dojo is ongoing. He won the NWA Florida Junior Heavyweight title of the Floridan promotion Pro Wrestling Fusion by defeating Chris Jones on November 29, 2008, and held it for 6 months before losing it back to Chris Jones, but he rebounded and received a Heavyweight title shot against Steve Madison only to lose a close contest. Iaukea's last match to date took place on October 17, 2015, unsuccessfully challenging for the Great Malenko Cup against Big O. Other media Hayner appeared as \\"Prince Iaukea\\" alongside several other WCW wrestlers in the 2000 movie Ready to Rumble. Personal life Hayner is married to Georgette and has a son who wrestles professionally under the name of Nick Primo. Hayner and his son both currently work for Pro Wrestling Fusion, New Florida Wrestling (NFW), and Definitive Wrestling International (DWI); all are Florida based independent wrestling promotions.

The first full length medical study of the condition was John Eric Erichsen's classic book, On Railway and Other Injuries of the Nervous System. For this reason, railway spine is often known as Erichsen's disease. Railway collisions were a frequent occurrence in the early 19th century. Exacerbating the problem was the fact that railway cars were flimsy, wooden structures with no protection for the occupants. Soon a group of people started coming forward who claimed that they had been injured in train crashes, but had no obvious evidence of injury. The railroads rejected these claims as fake. The nature of symptoms caused by \\"railway spine\\" was hotly debated in the late 19th century, notably at the meetings of the (Austrian) Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna, 1886. Germany's leading neurologist, Hermann Oppenheim, claimed that all railway spine symptoms were due to physical damage to the spine or brain, whereas French and British scholars, notably Jean-Martin Charcot and Herbert Page, insisted that some symptoms could be caused by hysteria (now known as conversion disorder). Erichsen observed that those most likely to be injured in a railway crash were those sitting with their backs to the acceleration. This is the same injury mechanism found in whiplash. As with automobile accidents, railway and airplane accidents are now known to cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychosomatic symptoms in addition to physical trauma.

It is one of the longest structures in the world. It stretches from Jimbour on the Darling Downs near Dalby through thousands of kilometres of arid land ending west of Eyre peninsula on cliffs of the Nullarbor Plain above the Great Australian Bight near Nundroo. It has been partly successful, though dingoes can still be found in parts of the southern states. Although the fence has helped reduce losses of sheep to predators, this has been countered by holes in fences found in the 1990s through which dingo offspring have passed and by increased pasture competition from rabbits and kangaroos. Geography The section of the fence in Queensland is also known as the Great Barrier Fence or Wild Dog Barrier Fence 11. It is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Wild Dog Barrier Fence staff consists of 23 employees, including two-person teams that patrol a section of the fence once every week. There are depots at Quilpie and Roma. The Queensland Border Fence stretches for westwards along the border with New South Wales, into the Strzelecki Desert. The fence passes the point where the three states of Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia meet (Cameron Corner). At this point, it connects with the South Australian Border Fence, which runs for southwards along the border with New South Wales. It then joins a section known as the Dog Fence in South Australia, which is long. Physical design The fence varies in construction. Mostly it is made of high wire mesh but some sections in South Australia comprise multi-strand electric fence . The fence line on both sides is cleared to a width. Sheep and cattle stations in Australia protected by the fence are astoundingly large. While varying in size, some stations can be larger than small countries. One station alone in South Australia lost over 11,000 sheep in a year due to dingo attacks before the completion of the fence. As recently as 1991, one station lost 3000 sheep in a year . Sheep farmers fought back by using poisoning, shooting, and eventually constructing the longest fence in the world. Aerial poison bait drops are still used today. Parts of the Dingo Fence are lit at night by cold cathode fluorescent lamps which are alternately red and white. They are powered by long life batteries which are charged by photovoltaic cells during the day.News - JKL Components Corporation At minor and farm crossings, a series of gates allow vehicles to pass through the fence. Where the fence intersects major roads and highways, cattle grids are used to allow high-speed vehicles through. History A portion of the Dingo Fence in 1952 in Queensland The earliest pest exclusion fences in Australia were created to protect small plots of cropland from the predation by marsupials. In the 1860s and 1870s, introduced rabbit populations began to spread rapidly across southern Australia. By 1884, a rabbit-proof fence was built. Having been unsuccessful at keeping rabbits out, and more successful at keeping out pigs, kangaroos, emus and brumbies, and as more sheep farms were established, the interest for a dingo-proof barrier increased enough that government funds were being used to heighten and expand the fence. In 1930, an estimated 32,000 km of dog netting in Queensland alone was being used on top of rabbit fences. Prior to 1948, the idea of a Dingo Barrier Fence Scheme had not come into fruition as a statewide project for which annual maintenance and repair were kept. Since this time, there have been pushes to move away from a method of barrier-exclusion to complete extinction of the dingo and wild-dog cross-breeds. Poisoning the species with compound 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) baits has been seen as a much cheaper alternative than fence maintenance. A compromise in the form of the continued use of poison and the shortening of the fence from its previous length of over 8000 km has been made. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the dingo fence was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic \\"innovation and invention\\". Environmental impact alt=Distribution map of Australian dingoes. The black line represents the Dingo fence (after Fleming et al. 2001). It seems that there are fewer kangaroos and emus on the northwestern side of the fence where the dingoes are, suggesting that the dingoes' presence reduces the populations of those animals. It has also been suggested that the larger kangaroo populations inside the fence have been caused by the lack of dingo predation, and competition for food leads to lower sheep stocking rates than would be possible without the fence. Believed to have been introduced into Australia by Aboriginals between 4,600 and 18,300 years ago, the dingo's status as a native or introduced species in Australia has been a controversy. According to Dr. Mike Letnic, at the Centre for Ecosystem Science, UNSW, the dingo, as Australia's top predator, has an important role in maintaining the balance of nature and that reintroduced or existing dingo populations could increase biodiversity across more than 2 million square kilometres of Australia (Avolia 2009). Where dingoes had been exterminated, Dr. Letnic found increased abundances of introduced red foxes and herbivores, while small native mammals and grasses were lost. In 2011 the Liberal MP for Stuart, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, called for a $200 bounty on dingos. Although the fence has helped reduce the loss of sheep to predators, the exclusion of dingoes has allowed for increased pasture competition from rabbits, kangaroos and emus. Sheep are being lost to increasing numbers of feral dogs.

After the test, Penney became chief adviser to the newly created British government's United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). He was later chairman of the authority, which he used in international negotiations to control nuclear testing with the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Penney's notable scientific contributions included the mathematics for complex wave dynamics, both in shock and gravity waves, proposing optimisation problems and solutions in hydrodynamics (which plays a major role in materials science and metallurgy.) During his later years, Penney lectured in mathematics and physics, and was the Rector of Imperial College London 1967‚Äì1973. Early life and education William George \\"Bill\\" Penney was born in Gibraltar on 24 June 1909. His father, William A. Penney, was a sergeant-major in the British Army's Ordnance Corps who was then serving overseas. His mother was Blanche Evelyn Johnson. Young William was raised in Sheerness, Kent, and was educated at Sheerness Technical School for Boys from 1924 to 1926, where he displayed a talent for science. He then attended the local technical school in Colchester, the Gilberd School, where he completed his technical studies. In 1927, his passion for science landed him in a local science laboratory where he worked as an assistant which helped him to gain a scholarship to study science at Imperial College of Science. He applied and was admitted to the Imperial College Faculty of Natural Sciences where he began taking courses on mathematics, particularly courses on Linear Algebra, Calculus, Partial differential equations and differential geometry. His talent was recognised by the Governor's Prize for Mathematics from the faculty of science. In 1929 Penney graduated, obtaining the BSc in Mathematics with First Class Honours at age 20. Penney was admitted to the post-graduate department that year, and earned his MSc in mathematics in 1931. Then he was offered a research position at the London University, where he studied for a doctorate. In 1932, Penney was awarded the PhD in Mathematics after submitting his doctoral thesis containing work on optimisation and cross section of the physical properties of solid-state crystals. Penney accepted a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship and first travelled to the United States where he became foreign research associate at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, returning to England soon after. In England, Penney was granted the 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to attend Trinity College, Cambridge. He changed his mathematical career to physics, and conducted a thorough research and theoretical investigation into the structure of metals and the magnetic properties of crystals. In 1935, Penney submitted his final thesis and obtained a D.Sc. in Mathematical Physics from the University of Cambridge; his thesis contained the fundamental work in the applications of quantum mechanics to the physics of crystals. In 1936, he was elected to the Stokes studentship at Pembroke College, Cambridge, but in the same year he returned to London and was appointed Reader in Mathematics at Imperial College London, a post he held from 1936 to 1945. As a recognised prodigy at Imperial College he was set for a distinguished academic career until World War II intervened.  World War II  At the start of World War II, Penney's leading-edge research into the applications of physics was noticed, and he was offered a research position with the Royal Navy. He had made significant contributions to the application of collisions, explosion events that created shock waves, and applications involving military use of hydrodynamics and gravity waves. The Admiralty and Home Office asked Penney to investigate problems connected with the properties of under-water blast waves from high explosives, a subject of great importance in designing ships and torpedoes. With Royal Navy engineer officers he designed and supervised development of the Mulberry harbours to be placed off the Normandy beaches during the D-Day invasion. These mobile breakwaters would protect the landing craft and troops from the Atlantic rollers. In 1943, he was released from his Royal Navy work, and went to the physics faculty of the Imperial College London, his alma mater. Then he joined Tube Alloys the secret nuclear weapon directorate, and shortly before D-Day in 1944, Penney was made head of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project, when a large team of British scientists joined the American atomic bomb project. Penney and others went to the Los Alamos Laboratory. The Manhattan Project At Los Alamos Penney worked on the use of the atomic bomb, particularly the height at which it should be detonated. He quickly gained recognition for his scientific talents, and also for his leadership qualities and ability to work in harmony with others. Within a few weeks of his arrival he was added to the core group of scientists making key decisions in the direction of the programme. Other members of that team included J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann, Norman F. Ramsey and Captain William Parsons of the United States Navy (USN). One of Penney's assignments at Los Alamos was to predict the damage effects from the blast wave of an atomic bomb. On 16 July 1945, Penney was an observer at the Trinity test detonation. He was there to observe the effect of radiant heating in igniting structural materials, and had also designed apparatus to monitor the blast effect of the explosions. The Americans considered him to be among the five most distinguished British contributors to the work. General Leslie Groves, overall director of the Manhattan Project, later wrote: Penney went to Washington for a top secret committee target selection meeting. He recommended Hiroshima and Nagasaki because of the hills surrounding the target which he said would create maximum devastation. He gave valuable advice regarding the height of the bomb detonation which would ensure optimum destructive effects, whilst ensuring the fireball did not touch the earth, thereby avoiding permanent radiation contamination on the ground. The U.S. nuclear team repeatedly attempted to recruit Penney as a permanent member, without success. Along with RAF Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, he accompanied the American Team to Tinian Island from which the Hiroshima and Nagasaki missions were flown. On 9 August 1945 he witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. The US authorities had controversially stopped them seeing the Hiroshima detonation, but at the last minute Penney and Cheshire were granted permission to fly in the B-29 Big Stink, one of the observation planes that accompanied the Nagasaki weapon delivery bomber Bockscar. Due to the belated permission, Big Stink missed its rendezvous with the bomber at Nagasaki. They saw the Nagasaki detonation from the air at a distance. As the leading expert on the effects of nuclear weapons, Penney was a member of the team of scientists and military analysts who entered Hiroshima and Nagasaki following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945 to assess the effects of nuclear weapons. Postwar At the end of the war the British government, now under Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee, believed that America would share the technology that British leaders saw as a joint discovery under the terms of the 1943 Quebec Agreement. In December 1945 PM Attlee ordered the construction of an atomic pile to produce plutonium and requested a report to detail requirements for Britain's atomic bombs. Penney returned to England and intended to resume his academic career, but was approached by C. P. Snow and asked to take up post as Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, called \\"Caesar\\") at Fort Halstead in Kent, as he suspected Britain was going to have to build an atomic bomb of its own and the government wanted Penney in this job. As CSAR he was responsible for all types of armaments research. In 1946, at the request of General Leslie Groves and the US Navy, Penney returned to the United States where he was put in charge of the blast effects studies for Operation Crossroads. In July, he was present at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands and wrote the after action reports on the effects of the two nuclear detonations. His reputation was further enhanced when, after the sophisticated test gauges failed, he was able to determine the blast power using observations from simple devices (empty oil drums). The British Nuclear Weapons Programme However the passing of the McMahon Act (Atomic Energy Act) by the Truman administration in August 1946 made it clear that Britain would no longer be allowed access to US atomic research. Penney left the United States and returned to the United Kingdom where he initiated his plans for an Atomic Weapons Section, submitting them to the Lord Portal (Marshal of the Royal Air Force) in November 1946. During the winter of 1946‚Äì1947, Penney returned to the United States, where he served as a scientific adviser to the British representative at the American Atomic Energy Commission. With almost all other aspects of atomic co-operation between the countries at an end, Penney's personal role was seen as keeping the contact alive between the parties. Attlee's government decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin - \\"We've got to have it and it's got to have a bloody Union Jack on it.\\" Officially, the decision to proceed with the British atomic bomb project was made in January 1947 - however arrangements were already under way. The necessary plutonium was on order from Harwell and in the Armaments Research Department of the Ministry of Supply, an Atomic Weapons Section was being organised. The project was based at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich and was code-named High Explosive Research (or HER). In May 1947, Penney was officially named to head the HER project. The following month Penney began assembling teams of scientists and engineers to work on the new technologies that had to be developed. In June 1947, Penney gathered his fledgling team in the library at the Royal Arsenal and gave a two-hour talk on the principles of the atomic bomb. Centred at Fort Halstead, the work proceeded on schedule. In 1950, the first bomb was expected to be ready within two years and would require a test. AWRE The research was spread across several test facilities in the UK, with confusing lines of authority and responsibility. The bomb design was also complex and innovative; although it started off with the Nagasaki bomb design, completely new methods of arming and of electrical detonation were used. It was realised that a single site was required, and in April 1950 an abandoned World War II airfield, RAF Aldermaston in Berkshire was selected as the permanent home for the British nuclear weapons programme. In 1951 the first scientific staff arrived at Aldermaston, and soon after the HER project vacated the Royal Arsenal. On 3 October 1952, under the code-name \\"Operation Hurricane\\", the first British nuclear device was successfully detonated off the west coast of Australia in the Monte Bello Islands. Penney was also aware of the public relations issues associated with the tests, and made clear-speaking presentations to the Australian press. Before one series of tests the Australian High Commissioner described his press presence: \\"Sir William Penney has established in Australia a reputation which is quite unique: his appearance, his obvious sincerity and honesty, and the general impression he gives that he would rather be digging his garden ‚Äì and would be, but for the essential nature of his work ‚Äì have made him a public figure of some magnitude in Australian eyes\\". The British \\"H-bomb\\" In 1954, nuclear development was transferred from the Ministry of Supply (MoS) to the newly formed United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). From 1954 to 1967, Sir William served on the UKAEA Board, becoming Chairman in 1962. In the mid 1950s Britain felt the need to quickly develop megaton class weapons because it seemed that atmospheric testing could soon be outlawed by treaty. As a result, the UK wanted to demonstrate its ability to manufacture megaton class weapons by proof-testing them before any legal prohibitions were in place. According to an article in New Scientist, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was also hoping to convince the US to change the McMahon Act, which prohibited sharing information even with the British, by demonstrating that the UK had the technology to make a thermonuclear weapon (an H-bomb), and he put Penney in charge of developing this bomb. The Orange Herald bomb was developed and was passed off as a thermonuclear bomb, when in fact it was a boosted fission weapon in which little of the energy came from fusion. The test of this weapon was successful in convincing the Americans to allow information sharing with the British. Imperial College Lord Penney was Rector of Imperial College London from 1967 to 1973. The college built and named the William Penney Laboratory in his honour in 1987. In 1957 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of Imperial College but failed to turn up to be formally presented with the document, which was eventually sent to him by post. Legacy In later years he admitted to qualms about his work but felt it was necessary. When aggressively questioned by the McClelland Royal Commission investigating the test programmes at Monte Bello and Maralinga in 1985, he acknowledged that at least one of the 12 tests probably had unsafe levels of fallout. However, he maintained that due care was taken and that the tests conformed to the internationally accepted safety standards of the time, a position which was confirmed from official records by Lorna Arnold. McClelland broadly accepted Penney's view but anecdotal evidence to the contrary received wide coverage in the press. By promoting a more Australian nationalist view, then current in the government of Bob Hawke, McClelland had also identified \\"villains\\" in the previous Australian and British administrations. As a senior witness Penney bore the brunt of the allegations, and his health was badly affected by the experience. He died a few years later at his home in the village of East Hendred, aged 81. In his obituary in the New York Times he was credited as the father of the British atomic bomb. The Guardian described him as its \\"guiding light\\", and his scientific and administrative leadership was said to be crucial in its successful and timely creation. His leadership of the team that exploded the first British hydrogen bomb at Christmas Island was instrumental in restoring the exchange of nuclear technology between Britain and the US in 1958, and he was credited as playing a leading part in the negotiations which led to the treaty forbidding atmospheric nuclear tests in 1963. His Kronig- Penney model for the behaviour of an electron in a periodic potential is still taught and used today in solid-state physics, and is used to explain the origin of band gaps. Titles, styles, honours and arms During his lifetime William Penney was made a Commonwealth Fund Fellow at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1932); Fellow of the Royal Society (1946); Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1970). Among the honours he received was the Rumford Medal by the Royal Society (1966). He was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath in 1966. For services to the United States, he was one of the first recipients of the United States Medal of Freedom (with Silver Palm), awarded by President Harry S. Truman. For his services to Britain he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE; 1946); raised to Knight Commander of the order (KBE; 1952); made a life peer, taking the title Baron Penney, of East Hendred in the Royal County of Berkshire (7 July 1967); awarded the Order of Merit (OM; 1969). He served on the board of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (from 1954 to 1967) and became its Chairman (1962‚Äì1967). In 1974 he chaired a committee assessing the need for an expert group to be set up to advise and warn the engineering profession on matters of structural safety, which reported positively, and he served as the first chairman of the UK's Standing Committee on Structural Safety from 1976 to 1982.Standing Committee on Structural Safety.

It contains the village of Forestville, which has been restored to a 19th-century appearance. The Minnesota Historical Society operates it as a historic site. Below ground the park contains Mystery Cave, the state's longest cave, which is open to the public. The park is between Spring Valley and Preston, Minnesota. Mystery Cave The park is in the Driftless Area, noted for its karst topography, which includes sinkholes and caves. The park is about from Mystery Cave and occupies approximately , with camping, interpretive programs, and hiking, horseback, cross-country skiing trails, cold water streams and excellent trout fishing. The cave includes stalactites, stalagmites, and underground pools, and is a constant . It has over of passages in two rock layers and is being resurveyed and remapped by volunteers. Geologic history About 450 million years ago sedimentary rocks were deposited as the land was intermittently covered by shallow seas that transgressed and regressed. Over the eons the alternating deposits of mud and oceanic debris were compressed to form limestone, shale and sandstone layers. Today these layers are above sea level. Within the last 500,000 to 1,000,000 years, flood waters dissolved along fractures in the limestone bedrock to create most of the cave. Acidic rainwater also sculpted the land above and around the cave, creating thousands of sinkholes and other karst features in the surrounding county. Wildlife The park contains a range of wildlife, from relatively rare species such as glacial snails and timber rattlesnakes to common species such as deer, raccoon, beaver, two species of fox, mink, opossum, woodchuck, and four species of squirrels. Coyotes howl at dusk. Numerous reptiles and amphibians are present. At least 175 species of birds have also been recorded. The South Branch of the Root River contains brown trout, brook trout, and rainbow trout. Historic Forestville The Minnesota Historical Society operates Historic Forestville as a living museum set in 1899. Costumed interpreters portray Forestville residents and go about daily activities in the general store, house, kitchen, farm, and barn. Forestville was a rural trade center in the 1800s that declined after the railroad was built elsewhere in 1868. Thomas Meighen, son of one of the town's founders, owned the entire village by 1890, including the general store, and the local residents worked on his property for housing and credit in the store. Admission to Historic Forestville is separate from the caves. Historic Forestville is open from May through October.

Northern has long-standing rivalries with nearby high-school North Toronto Collegiate Institute and also with Central Technical School, Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute, York Mills Collegiate Institute and Leaside High School. History Founded in 1930, it was originally known as Northern Vocational School, until the twenty-fifth anniversary when the name was changed to Northern Technical-Commercial, which lasted for three years until the present name, Northern Secondary School, came into use because a definite district had been assigned for matriculation students. Northern was the first Ontario school to have a student council. The school is a pilot site of a Toronto Police Service program that places on-duty police officers in schools. On May 13, 2016 it was alleged that a bomb was planted on the premises and the school was shut down to investigate. No explosive devices were found. Architecture Northern Secondary is built in the Collegiate Gothic style, has a floor space of about 121,317 square feet and contains one hundred and fifteen rooms. C.E.C. Dyson was the school's original architect. Although little is known about him, he was the school board's architect from 1921 until 1949. Northern is known for the grotesques which exist on the exterior, throughout the entrance foyer and inside the auditorium. Further evidence of the Gothic Collegiate style can be found in the vaulted ceilings of the hallways, and the arched doorways and windows featured throughout the building. As stated on a plaque inside the main entrance, during the 60s a major addition was built which significantly altered the rear of the school. These renovations changed little about the original parts of the building. Although once grand, over the decades, the facility has fallen into considerable disrepair and is in need of extensive renovation. An exterior grotesque A vaulted hallway ceiling An arched side entrance Northern Secondary School Academics Northern's gifted program / enriched program and its comprehensive range of elective courses, including a diverse art department, bring students in from across the city.

There is a large variety of gifted courses available at all grade levels and AP courses available at the grade 11 and 12 levels. Each year, Northern's students obtain over $1 million in university scholarships. Northern's students have won numerous national & international awards in multiple academic disciplines. These include the NASA space settlement competition, the World Debates at Oxford, England, and the Canadian Association of Physicists national contest. Northern debaters are also the current reigning OSDU provincial debate championships. The school has over 50 active clubs, associations and committees, as well as over 120 teachers, resulting in a 15 to 1 student teacher ratio. Sports The school has over 50 varsity athletic teams.

The book is set in India during a period of intense urban development and is the chronicle of the marriage between Rukmani, youngest daughter of a village headman, and Nathan, a tenant farmer. The story is told in the first person by Rukmani, beginning from her arranged marriage to Nathan at the age of 12 to his death many years later. Title The title of the novel is taken from the 1825 poem \\"Work Without Hope\\", by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. An excerpt from the poem is the epigraph of the novel: :Work without hope draws nectar in a sieve, :And hope without an object cannot live. In the novel, Rukmani comments, \\"Change I had known before, and it had been gradual. But the change that now came into my life, into all our lives, blasting its way into our village, seemed wrought in the twinkling of an eye.\\" Plot introduction Rukmani and Nathan love each other and their marriage begins in relative peace and plenty. When a large tannery is built in the neighboring village, it begins insidiously destroying their lives. As the tannery grows larger and more prosperous, Rukmani and Nathan struggle to feed their children and to pay the rent on the land that gives them life. Although matters continue to worsen, they quietly resign themselves to ever-increasing hardships‚Äîflood, famine, even death‚Äîand cling to their hopes for a better future. Dr. Kennington, or \\"Kenny\\", an itinerant English doctor, is an important presence in the novel. Although Rukmani's fatalistic attitude toward hardship exasperates him, he feels compassion for her and helps her when he can. At the end, Rukmani goes to live with her youngest son, now a doctor at the hospital Kenny has built. Throughout the novel, Rukmani is faced with struggle after struggle with no indication that her circumstances will improve. Each time her situation worsens, she endures quietly, holding on to the hope that things will soon be better. Plot summary Rukmani, an old woman, reflects on her life. The educated daughter of a village headman fallen on hard times, she is married at the age of 12 to Nathan, a tenant farmer. Nathan treats her with kindness and respect as she learns the chores her new life requires. Within a year they have a beautiful daughter, Ira, and good rice harvests. During the next six years, Rukmani does not conceive. Troubled that she cannot produce a son for Nathan, Rukmani visits her ill mother and there meets Kenny, a foreign doctor. He treats her infertility without Nathan's knowledge. In quick succession, Rukmani bears five sons. With each birth, however, the family has a little less to eat. When a tannery is built nearby, unpleasant changes come to village life. Rukmani's two oldest sons eventually work there. They help the family a great deal with their wages but are eventually dismissed for being ringleaders in a labor strike. The year they arrange a good marriage for Ira, monsoon rains destroy their crops. Rukmani sacrifices her savings to buy food for the family. Ira's husband returns Ira to her parents‚Äô home because she is barren. Again Rukmani turns to Kenny without her husband's knowledge, this time to help Ira conceive. His treatments are too late, however, since Ira's husband has taken another woman. Rukmani becomes pregnant again and bears her last son, Kuti. Caring for Kuti lifts Ira out of her depression and despair until the crops fail from drought and the family once again goes hungry. They sell most of their possessions just to pay half of what they owe the landowner for their lease. Reduced to foraging for roots and leaves, the family begins to weaken and starve. Kenny secures a servant's position in the city for Rukmani's third son. Rukmani's fourth son is killed stealing a calfskin from the tannery. Kuti suffers the most from hunger, and Ira prostitutes herself to feed him. Despite her efforts, he dies. A good rice harvest arrives too late to save Rukmani's sons. Kenny returns from one of his long absences with money raised to build a hospital in the village. He offers to train Rukmani's remaining son, Selvam, as his assistant. Some villagers speculate that Kenny is kind to Rukmani because they have an illicit relationship. Kunthi, a neighborhood wife who became a prostitute, spreads this rumor out of spite. When they were both young, Nathan fathered Kunthi's two sons. Kunthi uses this as leverage over them until Rukmani learns the truth and forgives Nathan. Now, as Nathan nears fifty, he has no sons left to work the land. He suffers from rheumatism and debilitating fevers. Rukmani and Ira try to help, but they are not strong enough. Ira has a baby to care for, an albino boy conceived in prostitution but loved nonetheless. The family experiences its greatest loss when the land agent tells Nathan and Rukmani their land has been sold to the despised tannery. No one else will lease land to a man as old and ill as Nathan, and Rukmani and Nathan must leave their home of 30 years to live with to their son Murugan in the city. They leave Ira and their grandchild under Selvam's care. Their possessions reduced to the few bundles they carry, Nathan and Rukmani try to find Murugan in the city. They rest one night at a temple, where thieves steal their bundles and money. A leprous street urchin named Puli helps them find the home of Kenny's doctor friend. They learn that Murugan has not worked there for the past two years and that he left the position for better wages at the Collector's house. At the Collector's, Murugan's wife informs them that Murugan has deserted her. Her older boy, their grandson, is thin with hunger. Her starving baby is too little to be Murugan's son. Rukmani sees that she and Nathan cannot impose upon their daughter-in-law. They return to the temple, where food is distributed each night to the destitute. Rukmani and Nathan dream of home but have no means to make the trip. Rukmani tries to get work as a letter reader but earns only enough to buy rice cakes. Puli takes them to a stone quarry where there is better-paying work. He helps them learn to break stones, and they come to rely on him. They entrust him with their earnings, and, as they save, they begin to hope. One evening, Rukmani splurges on extra food and toys for Puli and her grandson. When she returns to Nathan at the temple, she expects him to be angry, but instead he is violently ill. During a week of monsoon rains, Nathan continues to work in the quarry despite his fevers and chills. One evening, after she gets paid, Rukmani begins to plan for a cart to take them home. Hurrying to catch up with Nathan, she finds him collapsed in the mud in the street. Kind strangers help carry him to the temple, where he dies in her arms after reminding her of their happiness together. After his death, Rukmani rashly promises Puli his health if he returns to the country with her, a promise Kenny and Selvam will help her keep. She introduces Puli to Selvam and Ira as the son she and Nathan adopted while they were away. Demonstrating hope and compassion, Ira hastens to prepare a meal for Puli, and Selvam promises his mother they will manage.

She is the younger sister of Lois Lane, and one of several characters who has assumed the Superwoman identity. Maureen Teefy portrayed her in the 1984 movie Supergirl, Peyton List in the television series Smallville and Jenna Dewan in the series Supergirl.  Publication history  Lucy Lane was created by Otto Binder and Curt Swan. She was introduced in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #36 (April 1959). She is the daughter of Ella and Sam Lane, and the younger sister of Lois Lane.  Fictional character biography  Jimmy Olsen and Lucy Lane, from her debut. Art by Curt Swan and John Giunta. In the Silver Age stories, Lucy was presented as an airline stewardess who was an on-again, off-again romantic interest of Jimmy Olsen. Lucy's Silver Age appearances often revolved around Jimmy's various attempts at romancing her. A wedding took place in Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen issue #100 (March 1967) which was intended to be a permanent change to the comic's status quo, but editor Mort Weisinger changed his mind at the last minute, and had writer Leo Dorfman change the ending to include a sudden annulment of the marriage. The character was believed to have died in Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #120 (March 1972) but was later revived in a story in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #160 (October 1973). Lucy was reintroduced into DC Comics' continuity in The Man of Steel #5 (December 1986). Lucy was an air traffic controller, but became affected by a mysterious blindness (implied to have poisoned by Lex Luthor) that was cured as a side-effect of the destruction of a Bizarro clone. Lucy returned to her job and had a brief relationship with Jimmy Olsen. After many encounters with super-villains such as Sleez, Deathstroke, and even becoming a vampire bride, she eventually started dating African-American Daily Planet staff member Ron Troupe. When Lucy became pregnant, her conservative father was enraged although Lucy explained \\"There's not a racist bone in Daddy's body. He hates all his daughters' beaus.\\" Sam Lane eventually overcame his anger when Lucy and Ron were married and their child was born. = New Krypton = After a long disappearance from the principal storylines, Lucy Lane returns in the one shot Superman: New Krypton. Her past with Ron Troupe is unclear, they are possibly estranged (Troupe having resurfaced in the current storylines, working again with the Daily Planet). Her long disappearance is explained by her joining the military, in a desperate, post-mortem attempt to appease her (presumed) dead father's desire to have a son able to carry on his career in the military. Bitter and angrier than in her former appearances, she still blames Lois for General Sam Lane's apparent death during the war against Imperiex. Essentially, she thinks Lois broke his heart by putting her love for Superman before her duties as a daughter. Lucy references her former appearances, even mentioning her \\"dating boys in Lois' circle\\" as failed attempts to live her life through her more successful sister, but she eventually chooses to sacrifice her life and live the military career her father intended for Lois, driving an even deeper wedge between the two sisters. Unbeknownst to her, their father is still alive, and working with the government. = Superwoman = Lucy Lane as Superwoman. Art by Jamal Igle. Lucy first appeared as Superwoman in Supergirl #35, her costume a nod to that of the Bronze Age Superwoman Kristin Wells and containing a containment field that simulated Kryptonian powers. Lucy's identity was not revealed until near the story arc's end. During her tenure as Superwoman, she was ordered by her father, General Sam Lane, to kill Agent Liberty, who had been spying on General Lane and Lex Luthor. She later attacked Reactron, which tipped off readers that Superwoman was not Kryptonian (in that the villain's Gold Kryptonite power source had no effect on her). Supergirl unmasks Superwoman, and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit, causing Lucy's body to contort and explode. In Supergirl Annual #1 readers are given the current modern backstory of Lucy Lane. In the story, Lucy, since the moment she was born, has felt overshadowed by her big sister Lois. Lucy always felt that Lois outperformed her, overshadowed her and was more loved by their father. Lucy never blames Lois but she blames her parents Sam and Ella. Feeling that by maybe being closer to Lois her father would pay more attention to her, Lucy moved to the same city but this came at the same time Lois and her father grew apart over Superman. After her father's death, Lucy joined the army. Being a great soldier and a woman, Lucy rose quickly in the ranks. During the Amazon attack on the United States, Lucy was nearly killed by two Amazons but was saved by Codename: Assassin. Awaking in Project 7734, her father is able to convince Lucy to put on the Superwoman suit, which possessed mystical qualities. Although seemingly dead, Lucy's remains steal the lifeforce of a man who came too close. When Lucy is recovered by General Lane's forces, they learn that the suit's mystic energies have somehow transformed her into an actual Kryptonian. Following the War of the Supermen storyline, Lucy is in custody in S.T.A.R. Labs by Kimiyo Hoshi and Gangbuster, who are attempting to remove Lucy's metahuman abilities. After interference by an object that crashes into a Metropolis park, before they leave Lucy's holding cell, it is shown seemingly to have lightly cracked. Later, Lucy is visited by her sister Lois, who wants to talk. Lucy is unhelpful as she has completely given in to insanity. Lois tells Lucy that she is disgusted by her and walks away leaving Lucy in S.T.A.R. Labs custody behind. Although the crack in the cell seemed to hint at Lucy escaping at some point, nothing came of it, and once The New 52 was launched, all storylines in progress in DC were dropped in favor of the new continuity. = The New 52 = In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Lucy Lane is first seen where she was picked up from the train station by Lois after Clark Kent was unable to fulfill his promise to Lois to do it himself. Later to make up for it, Clark accompanies her, Lois, Johnathan Carrol, and Morgan Edge to the most expensive restaurant in town but is later forced to leave her with the check due to his duties as Superman. Clark later makes it up to her by taking her bungee jumping, an activity which Lucy enjoys. Lucy befriended and later became roommates with Olivia after they met while white water rafting. They also adopted a cat named Simon. Olivia became ill and Doctor Obeshian gave her drugs to take, the drugs having secretly been taken from an alien fungus which would mutate the user into a shapeshifting creature. Lucy and Olivia both took the pills resulting in the former turning into a wolf like creature and the latter into a giant insect-like creature. An organization named the Cartel began kidnapping users of the drug, which had begun circulating on the streets, for detox and they managed to capture Olivia. Lucy convinced Lois to save Olivia. In her insect form Lucy rescued Lois and Olivia from the Cartel's base. The issue ended with Lois comforting a hysterical Lucy.  Powers and abilities  Although Superwoman originally had no inherent powers, her powersuit altered her DNA via a containment field to resemble that of a Kryptonian and as such would potentially make her capable of all the same feats they possess under the yellow sun. The abilities she has used thus far are; vast superhuman strength, speed and durability, invulnerability, flight (normal and interstellar), freeze breath and heat vision. The powersuit protects her from the harmful effects of Kryptonite and grants her the ability to steal the life of someone nearby to resurrect herself. Any other non-Kryptonian abilities the suit may possess have yet to be revealed. Due to the launch of the New 52, it is unlikely that any of the suit's other powers will be revealed unless it makes an appearance in the new continuity. As a result of her resurrection in Supergirl #50, she is said to have all the inherent abilities and weaknesses of \\"Those alien races\\" which were duplicated by the suit as the result of her return from the dead. While the exact number of alien races whose powers are duplicated by the suit are unknown, Kryptonian powers are among the powerset, as she displayed the ability to use Heat Vision shortly after her recovery by Sam Lane's forces when she was reborn. She confirms that she possesses super hearing when she murders a scientist working for Lane, though she does so with some form of energy blast from her hand, a power that is not among the abilities of a Kryptonian. If this statement is accurate, Lucy Lane now shares the inherent weakness to Kryptonite which all Kryptonians possess. The original suit was destroyed by Supergirl but she appears to have acquired another as of Supergirl #50, and it is unknown if this suit is the same as the one she had been using to masquerade as a Kryptonian, or a non-magical one. After her mutation due to drugs created from an alien fungus Lucy can transform from her mutated form to her normal form. In her mutated form Lucy can fly and apparently withstand tranquilizer darts.  In other media  =Television= *A young version of Lucy Lane appears in the prologue of \\"Monkey Fun\\", an episode of Superman: The Animated Series, voiced by Aria Noelle Curzon. Lucy and her sister Lois are seen in a flashback playing with Titano the monkey during their childhood. Lucy as an adult is never explicitly identified in person. She is mentioned by Lois while Clark is talking about his trouble with Mr. Mxyzptlk's visits. *Lucy Lane appeared in three episodes of the television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, where she was portrayed by Elizabeth Barondes and by Roxana Zal in one episode. Her most prominent role was in the episode \\"Metallo\\" when she dated small-time criminal Johnny Corben before he was identified as new villain Metallo. Lucy and Lois in Smallville. *Lucy Lane first appeared on the television series Smallville in the season four episode \\"Lucy\\"; she was played by Peyton List. In this version, Lucy has been attending school in Europe for some time, and has consequently been out of touch with her sister Lois. Lucy is briefly mentioned in the episode \\"Persuasion\\" when Lois (under the effects of Jewel Kryptonite crystals that cause Clark to unintentionally influence anyone who hears his words to obey him) believes she is marrying Clark and calls Lucy to tell her she's getting married. Lucy appears in season 10's seventh episode, \\"Ambush\\", as she surprises Lois along with General Sam Lane when they arrive on the Kent farm before Thanksgiving. In the episode \\"Icarus\\", a VRA file on her sister lists Ron Troupe and Samuel Troupe as their relatives. Jenna Dewan as Lucy Lane in the CBS TV series Supergirl. *Lucy debuted in episode 3 of the Supergirl TV series, played by Jenna Dewan. This version of the character is Jimmy Olsen's ex-fianc√©e, with whom he soon reconciles. In this continuity, Lucy is a major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army assigned as a \\"trial counsel\\" (prosecutor). In the episode \\"Manhunter\\", she and Jim Harper interrogate Martian Manhunter and Alex Danvers before taking them into Project Cadmus. Supergirl reveals her identity to Lucy, who is made head of the D.E.O at the end of the episode. = Film = * Lucy Lane appears in the 1984 movie Supergirl as a friend and schoolmate of Supergirl's alter- ego Linda Lee.

It was released 30 March 2005, sold out, and quickly went to a second printing. When this comic was first published, the cover showed Batman holding a shadowed corpse, so as not to ruin the surprise of who dies. For the second printing, the shadows were removed to reveal the identity of the corpse. During initial solicitations the comic was entitled DC Countdown to postpone revelation of an upcoming crisis. Countdown was a special 80 page comic originally priced at $1, much lower than would normally be the case for an 80-page comic, although the second printing was priced at $2. The script was co-written by Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, and Judd Winick, while the art chores were divided up, generally on a chapter by chapter basis, between the penciller-inker teams of Rags Morales & Michael Bair, Jesus Saiz & Jimmy Palmiotti, Ivan Reis & Marc Campos, and Phil Jimenez & Andy Lanning. Artist Ed Benes pencilled and inked his chapter. Synopsis The main plot concerns Ted Kord, the superhero and former Justice League member known as the Blue Beetle, investigating the theft of funds from his company that has left him nearly bankrupt. Most of the other DC heroes except Wonder Woman dismiss Kord's concerns, either politely or, like Batman (who now remembers that the League had mind-wiped him), outright. Only Booster Gold, another superhero and Kord's best friend, eventually decides to help complete the investigation, but before he can he is seriously injured by an explosive trap. thumb Alone and unaided, Blue Beetle continues to follow the clues to Switzerland where he infiltrates the castle base of the Checkmate organization. There, he confronts Maxwell Lord, who is revealed to be using his Justice League files and Batman's satellite, the Brother MK I, to keep an eye on the superhero community, which he considers a threat to the human race. After Beetle refuses to join Lord, Lord executes him with a fatal gunshot to the head. Crossovers Countdown was bannered as a bridge to all four of the Crisis leadup titles, but featured each of them unevenly. The main plot was essentially an extended prologue to The OMAC Project. The events of Day of Vengeance were foreshadowed, when the Beetle confronted the wizard Shazam, but no particular hints about that title were made. The Rann-Thanagar War was mentioned on a single page, but seemed to already be underway in the story. The main characters of Villains United were featured in a single chapter of the book, but one that did not connect to the Blue Beetle storyline in any way. Collection Countdown was reprinted as part of the trade paperback collection of The OMAC Project, published November 2005 ().

Normal is also used to describe individual behavior that conforms to the most common behavior in society (known as conformity). Definitions of normality vary by person, time, place, and situation‚Äîit changes along with changing societal standards and social norms. Normality has been functionally and differentially defined by a vast number of disciplines, so there is not one single definition. However, normal behavior is often only recognized in contrast to abnormality. In its simplest form, normality is seen as good while abnormality is seen as bad. Someone being seen as normal or not normal can have social ramifications, such as being included, excluded or stigmatized by wider society. Measuring Many difficulties arise in measuring normal behaviors‚Äîbiologists come across parallel issues when defining normality. One complication that arises regards whether 'normality' is used correctly in everyday language. People say \\"this heart is abnormal\\" if only a portion of it is not working correctly, yet it may be inaccurate to include the entirety of the heart under the description of 'abnormal'. There can be a difference between the normality of a body part's structure and its function. Similarly, a behavioral pattern may not conform to social norms, but still be effective and non-problematic for that individual. Where there is a dichotomy between appearance and function of a behavior, it may be difficult to measure its normality. This is applicable when trying to diagnose a pathology and is addressed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Statistical normality In general, 'normal' refers to a lack of significant deviation from the average. The word normal is used in a more narrow sense in mathematics, where a normal distribution describes a population whose characteristics center around the average or the norm. When looking at a specific behavior, such as the frequency of lying, a researcher may use a Gaussian bell curve to plot all reactions, and a normal reaction would be within one standard deviation, or the most average 68.3%. However, this mathematical model only holds for one particular trait at a time, since, for example, the probability of a single individual being within one standard deviation for 36 independent variables would be one in a million. In statistics, normal is often arbitrarily considered anything that falls within about 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, i.e. the most average 95% (1.96). The probability of an individual being within 1.96 standard deviations for 269 independent variables is approximately one in a million.Figured mathematically 0.95^269 is approximately 0.000001 For only 59 independent variables, the probability is just under 5%.Figured mathematically 0.95^59 is approximately 0.048 Under this definition of normal, it is abnormal to be normal for 59 independent variables.  Sociology  =Durkheim= In his Rules of the Sociological Method, French sociologist √âmile Durkheim indicates that it is necessary for the sociological method to offer parameters in order to distinguish normality from pathology or abnormality. He suggests that behaviors, or social facts, which are present in the majority of cases are normal, and exceptions to that behavior indicate pathology. Durkheim's model of normality further explains that the most frequent or general behaviors, and thus the most normal behaviors, will persist through transition periods in society. Crime, for instance, should be considered normal because it exists in every society through every time period. There is a two-fold version of normality; behaviors considered normal on a societal level may still be considered pathological on an individual level. On the individual level, people who violate social norms, such as criminals, will invite a punishment from others in the society. = Social norms = An individual's behaviors are guided by what they perceive to be society's expectations and their peers' norms. People measure the appropriateness of their actions by how far away they are from those social norms. However, what is perceived as the norm may or may not actually be the most common behavior. In some cases of pluralistic ignorance, most people wrongly believe the social norm is one thing, but in fact very few people hold that view. When people are made more aware of a social norm, particularly a descriptive norm (i.e., a norm describing what is done), their behavior changes to become closer to that norm. The power of these norms can be harnessed by social norms marketing, where the social norm is advertised to people in an attempt to stop extreme behavior, such as binge drinking. However, people at the other extreme (very little alcohol consumption) are equally likely to change their behavior to become closer to the norm, in this case by increasing alcohol consumption. Instead of using descriptive norms, more effective social norms marketing may use injunctive norms which, instead of describing the most common behavior, outline what is approved or disapproved of by society. When individuals become aware of the injunctive norm, only the extremes will change their behavior (by decreasing alcohol consumption) without the boomerang effect of under-indulgers increasing their drinking. The social norms that guide people are not always normal for everyone. Behaviors that are abnormal for most people may be considered normal for a subgroup or subculture. For example, normal college student behavior may be to party and drink alcohol, but for a subculture of religious students, normal behavior may be to go to church and pursue religious activities. Subcultures may actively reject \\"normal\\" behavior, instead replacing society norms with their own. What is viewed as normal can change dependent on both timeframe and environment. Normality can be viewed as \\"an endless process of man's self-creation and his reshaping of the world.\\" Within this idea, it is possible to surmise that normality is not an all- encompassing term, but simply a relative term based around a current trend in time. With statistics, this is likened to the thought that if the data gathered provides a mean and standard deviation, over time these data that predict \\"normalness\\" start to predict or dictate it less and less since the social idea of normality is dynamic. This is shown in studies done on behavior in both psychology and sociology where behavior in mating rituals or religious rituals can change within a century in humans, showing that the \\"normal\\" way that these rituals are performed shifts and a new procedure becomes the normal one. Since normality shifts in time and environment, the mean and standard deviation are only useful for describing normality from the environment from which they are collected.  Sexual behavior  As another example, understandings of what is normal sexual behavior varies greatly across time and place. In many countries, perceptions on sexuality are largely becoming more liberal, especially views on the normality of masturbation and homosexuality. Social understanding on normal sexual behavior also varies greatly country by country; countries can be divided into categories of how they approach sexual normality, as conservative, homosexual-permissive, or liberal. The United States, Ireland, and Poland have more conservative social understanding of sexuality among university students, while Scandinavian students consider a wider variety of sexual acts as normal. Although some attempts have been made to define sexual acts as normal, abnormal, or indeterminate, these definitions are time-sensitive. Gayle Rubin's 1980s model of sexual 'normality' was comprehensive at the time but has since become outdated as society has liberalized. =Regulation= A disharmony exists between a virtual identity of the self and a real social identity, whether it be in the form of a trait or attribute. If a person does not have this disharmony, then he or she is described as normal. A virtual identity can take many definitions, but in this case a virtual identity is the identity that persons mentally create that conforms to societal standards and norms, it may not represent how they actually are, but it represents what they believe is the typical \\"normal\\" person. A real social identity is the identity that persons actually have in their society or is perceived, by themselves or others, to have. If these two identities have differences between each other, there is said to be disharmony. Individuals may monitor and adapt their behavior in terms of others' expected perceptions of the individual, which is described by the social psychology theory of self-presentation. In this sense, normality exists based on societal norms, and whether someone is normal is entirely up to how he or she views him- or herself in contrast to how society views him or her. While trying to define and quantify normality is a good start, all definitions confront the problem of whether we are even describing an idea that even exists since there are so many different ways of viewing the concept.Skopalov√°, Jitka. 2010. \\"Social eviations, Labelling, and Normality.\\" Human Affairs 20(4):327‚Äì37. . Retrieved 22 June 2020. =Effects of labeling= When people do not conform to the normal standard, they are often labelled as sick, disabled, abnormal, or unusual, which can lead to marginalization or stigmatization. Most people want to be normal and strive to be perceived as such, so that they can relate to society at large. Without having things in common with the general population, people may feel isolated among society. The abnormal person feels like they have less in common with the normal population, and others have difficulty relating to things that they have not experienced themselves. Additionally, abnormality may make others uncomfortable, further separating the abnormally labelled individual. Since being normal is generally considered an ideal, there is often pressure from external sources to conform to normality, as well as pressure from people's intrinsic desire to feel included. For example, families and the medical community will try to help disabled people live a normal life. However, the pressure to appear normal, while actually having some deviation, creates a conflict‚Äîsometimes someone will appear normal, while actually experiencing the world differently or struggling. When abnormality makes society feel uncomfortable, it is the exceptional person themselves who will laugh it off to relieve social tension. A disabled person is given normal freedoms, but may not be able to show negative emotions. Lastly, society's rejection of deviance and the pressure to normalize may cause shame in some individuals. Abnormalities may not be included in an individual's sense of identity, especially if they are unwelcome abnormalities. When an individual's abnormality is labelled as a pathology, it is possible for that person to take on both elements of the sick role or the stigmatization that follows some illnesses. Mental illness, in particular, is largely misunderstood by the population and often overwhelms others' impression of the patient. Intrapersonal normality Most definitions of normality consider interpersonal normality, the comparison between many different individual's behaviors to distinguish normality from abnormality. Intrapersonal normality looks at what is normal behavior for one particular person (consistency within a person) and would be expected to vary person-to-person. A mathematical model of normality could still be used for intrapersonal normality, by taking a sample of many different occurrences of behavior from one person over time. Also like interpersonal normality, intrapersonal normality may change over time, due to changes in the individual as they age and due to changes in society (since society's view of normality influences individual peoples' behavior). It is most comfortable for people to engage in behavior which conforms to their own personal habitual norms. When things go wrong, people are more likely to attribute the negative outcome on any abnormal behavior leading up to the mishap. After a car crash, people may say \\"if only I didn't leave work early,\\" blaming the crash on their actions which were not normal. This counterfactual thinking particularly associates abnormal behavior with negative outcomes.  Behavioral normality  In medicine, behavioral normality pertains to a patient's mental condition aligning with that of a model, healthy patient. A person without any mental illness is considered a normal patient, whereas a person with a mental disability or illness is viewed as abnormal. These normals and abnormals in the context of mental health subsequently create negative stigmatic perceptions towards individuals with mental illness. According to the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, \\"an estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older‚Äîabout 1 in 4 adults‚Äîsuffer from one or more of (several) disorders in a given year.\\" Though the population of American individuals living with mental illness is not as small of a minority as commonly perceived, it is considered abnormal nonetheless, therefore the subject of discrimination and abuse such as violent therapies, punishments, or labeling for life by the normal, healthy majority. The CDC reported that \\"cluster[s] of negative attitudes and beliefs motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses.\\" In continuum, the resources available to those who suffer from such illness are limited, and government support is constantly being cut from programs that help individuals living with mental illness live more comfortable, accommodative, happier lives.  Neuronal and synaptic normality  Hebbian associative learning and memory maintenance depends on synaptic normalization mechanisms to prevent synaptic runaway. Synaptic runaway describes overcrowding of dendritic associations, which reduce sensory or behavioral acuteness proportional to the level of synaptic runaway. Synaptic/neuronal normalization refers to synaptic competition, where the prosper of one synapse may weakening the efficacy of other nearby surrounding synapses with redundant neurotransmission. Animal dendritic density greatly increases throughout waking hours despite intrinsic normalization mechanisms as described as above. The growth rate of synaptic density is not sustained in a cumulative fashion. Without a pruning state, the signal to noise ratio of CNS mechanism would not be able to operate with maximum effectiveness, and learning would be detrimental to animal survival. Neuronal and synaptic normalization mechanisms must operate so positive association feedback loops to not become rampant while constantly processing new environmental information. Some researchers speculate that the slow oscillation (nREM) cycles of animal sleep constitute an essential 're-normalization' phase. The re-normalization occurs from cortical large amplitude brain rhythm, in the low delta range (0.5‚Äì2 Hz), synaptically downscaling the associations from the wakeful learning state. Only the strongest associations survive the pruning from this phase. This allows retention of salient information coding from the previous day, but also allows more cortical space and energy distribution to continue effective learning subsequently after a slow-wave oscillation episode of sleep. Also, organisms tend to have a normal biological developmental pathway as a central nervous system ages and/or learns. Deviations for a species' normal development frequently will result in behavior dysfunction, or death, of that organism.  Clinical normality  Applying normality clinically depends on the field and situation a practitioner is in. In the broadest sense, clinical normality is the idea of uniformity of physical and psychological functioning across individuals. Psychiatric normality, in a broad sense, states that psychopathology are disorders that are deviations from normality. Normality, and abnormality, can be characterized statistically. Related to the previous definition, statistical normality is usually defined it in terms of a normal distribution curve, with the so-called 'normal zone' commonly accounting for 95.45% of all the data. The remaining 4.55% will lie split outside of two standard deviations from the mean. Thus any variable case that lies outside of two deviations from the mean would be considered abnormal. However, the critical value of such statistical judgments may be subjectively altered to a less conservative estimate. It is in fact normal for a population to have a proportion of abnormals. The presence of abnormals is important because it is necessary to define what 'normal' is, as normality is a relative concept. So at a group, or macro, level of analysis, abnormalities are normal given a demographic survey; while at an individual level, abnormal individuals are seen as being deviant in some way that needs to be corrected. Statistical normality is important in determining demographic pathologies. When a variable rate, such as virus spread within a human population, exceeds its normal infection rate, then preventative or emergency measures can be introduced. However, it is often impractical to apply statistical normality to diagnose individuals. Symptom normality is the current, and assumed most effective, way to assess patient pathology. = DSM = Normality, as a relative concept, is intrinsically involved with contextual elements. As a result, clinical disorder classification has particular challenges in discretely diagnosing 'normal' constitutions from true disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the psychiatric profession's official classification manual of mental disorders since its first published version (DSM-I) by the American Psychological Association in 1952. As the DSM evolved into its current version (DSM-V) in late 2013, there have been numerous conflicts in proposed classification between mental illness and normal mentality. In his book Saving Normal, Dr. Allen Frances, who chaired the task force for content in the DSM- IV and DSM-IV-TR, wrote a scathing indictment of the pressures incumbent on the definition of \\"normal\\" relative to psychological constructs and mental illness. Most of this difficulty stems from the DSM's ambiguity of natural contextual stressor reactions versus individual dysfunction. There are some key progressions along the DSM history that have attempted to integrate some aspects of normality into proper diagnosis classification. As a diagnostic manual for classification of abnormalities, all DSMs have been biased towards classifying symptoms as disorders by emphasizing symptomatic singularity. The result is an encompassing misdiagnosis of possible normal symptoms, appropriate as contextually derived.  DSM-II  The second edition of the DSM could not be effectively applied because of its vague descriptive nature. Psychodynamic etiology was a strong theme in classifying mental illnesses. The applied definitions became idiosyncratic, stressing individual unconscious roots. This made applying the DSM unreliable across psychiatrists. No distinction between abnormal to normal was established. Evidence of the classification ambiguity were punctuated by the Rosenhan experiment of 1972. This experiment demonstrated that the methodology of psychiatric diagnosis could not effectively distinguish normal from disordered mentalities. DSM-II labelled 'excessive' behavioral and emotional response as an index of abnormal mental wellness to diagnose some particular disorders. 'Excessiveness' of a reaction implied alternative normal behavior which would have to include a situational factor in evaluation. As an example, a year of intense grief from the death of a spouse may be a normal appropriate response. To have intense grief for twenty years would be indicative of a mental disorder. As well, to grieve intensely over the loss of a sock would also not be considered normal responsiveness and indicate a mental disorder. The consideration of proportionality to stimuli was a perceived strength in psychiatric diagnosis for the DSM-II. Another characteristic of the DSM-II systemization was that it classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. Thus, homosexuality was psychiatrically defined a pathological deviation from 'normal' sexual development. Homosexuality was later replaced in the 7th printing of DSM-II, instead categorized as a 'Sexual orientation disturbance'. The intent was to have a label that applied only to those homosexual individuals who were bothered by their sexual orientation. In this manner homosexuality would not be viewed as an atypical illness. Only if it was distressing would homosexuality be classified as a mental illness. However, the DMS-II did not explicitly state that any homosexuality was normal either. This stigma lasted into DSM-III until it was reformed entirely from DSM classifications in 1987.  DSM-III  DSM-III was a best attempt to credit psychiatry as a scientific discipline from the opprobrium resulting from DSM-II. A reduction in the psychodynamic etiologies of DSM-II spilled over into a reduction symptom etiology altogether. Thus, DSM-III was a specific set of definitions for mental illnesses, and entities more suited to diagnostic psychiatry, but which annexed response proportionality as a classification factor. The product was that all symptoms, whether normal proportional response or inappropriate pathological tendencies, could both be treated as potential signs of mental illness.  DSM-IV  DSM-IV explicitly distinguishes mental disorders and non-disordered conditions. A non-disordered condition results from, and is perpetuated by, social stressors. Included in DSM-IV's classification is that a mental disorder \\"must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual\\" (American Psychiatric Association 2000:xxxi) This had supposedly injected normality consideration back into the DSM, from its removal from DSM-II. However, it has been speculated that DSM-IV still does not escape the problems DSM-III faced, where psychiatric diagnoses still include symptoms of expectable responses to stressful circumstances to be signs of disorders, along with symptoms that are individual dysfunctions. The example set by DSM- III, for principally symptom-based disorder classification, has been integrated as the norm of mental diagnostic practice.  DSM-5  The DSM-5 was released in the second half of 2013. It has significant differences from DSM IV-TR, including the removal of the multi-axial classifications and reconfiguring the Asperger's/autistic spectrum classifications.  Criticisms of diagnostics  Since the advent of DSM-III, the subsequent editions of the DSM have all included a heavy symptom based pathology diagnosis system. Although there have been some attempts to incorporate environmental factors into mental and behavioral diagnostics, many practitioners and scientists believe that the most recent DSM's are misused. The symptom bias makes diagnosing quick and easier allowing for practitioners to increase their clientele because symptoms can be easier to classify and deal with than dealing with life or event histories which have evoked what may be a temporary and normal mental state in reaction to a patients environmental circumstances. The easy-to-use manual not only has increased the perceived need for more mental health care, stimulating funding for mental health care facilities, but also has had a global impact on marketing strategies. Many pharmaceutical commercial ads list symptoms such as fatigue, depression, or anxiety. However, such symptoms are not necessarily abnormal, and are appropriate responses to such occurrences as the loss of a loved one. The targets of such ads in such cases do not need medication and can naturally overcome their grief, but with such an advertising strategy pharmaceutical companies can greatly expand their marketing.

He spent much of his career as a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he served as chair of the Department of Sociology, 1969‚Äì72, and as chair of the Division of Social Sciences, 1976-78.  Life and career  Lenski was born and raised in Washington, DC, the son of a Lutheran pastor, the grandson of German-born theologian Richard Charles Henry Lenski, and the nephew of children's author Lois Lenski. He attended Yale University where he received a BA degree in 1947, after serving as a cryptographer with the 8th Air Force in England in World War II, and then earned his PhD from Yale in 1950. Lenski was awarded a Pre-doctoral Fellowship by the Social Science Research Council, 1949‚Äì50, and later a Senior Faculty Fellowship, 1961‚Äì62; a Guggenheim Fellowship, 1972‚Äì73; and IREX Senior Faculty Exchange Fellowships, for Poland, 1978, and Hungary, 1988. He served as Vice President of the American Sociological Association, 1969‚Äì70, and was nominee for President in 1972. He was also President of the Southern Sociological Society, 1977‚Äì78 and elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1976. In 2002, he was awarded the Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award by the American Sociological Association. His writings have been translated into German, Swedish, Spanish, Polish, and Chinese (both mainland and Taiwanese translations). Lenski married poet Jean Cappelmann in 1948. He and Jean Lenski were active in the Civil Rights Movement and opponents of the Vietnam War. They had four children, including evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski. Following Jean's death in 1994, he married Ann Bonar, widow of sociologist Hubert \\"Tad\\" Blalock. Lenski died in Edmonds, Washington at the age of 91.  Scholarly work =Sociology of religion= Much of Lenski's earliest work dealt with the sociology of religion and culminated in the publication of The Religious Factor. He defines religion as \\"a system of beliefs about the nature of force(s) ultimately shaping man's destiny and the practices associated therewith, shared by the members of a group.Gerhard Lenski, The Religious Factor, p. 331 A reviewer in Commentary described the book as a \\"major achievement\\" in an often-neglected subfield, and Robert Wuthnow has referred to this volume as \\"arguably one of a handful of 'classics' among contributions by American sociologists to the social scientific study of religion.\\" In 1958, Lenski's empirical inquiry into \\"religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life\\" in the Detroit area revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with regard to economics and the sciences. Lenski's findings supported basic hypotheses of Max Weber's work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. According to Lenski, \\"the contributions of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory.\\" Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, had observed that \\"diligence and frugality\\" made Methodists wealthy. \\"In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted by both Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations.\\" However, Lenski said, asceticism was rare among modern Protestants, and the distinctive Protestant doctrine of \\"the calling\\" was largely forgotten. Instead, modern (white) Protestants and Jews had a high degree of \\"intellectual autonomy\\" that facilitated scientific and technical advance.Gerhard Lenski, The Religious Factor, pp. 350-352 By contrast, Lenski pointed out, Catholics developed an intellectual orientation which valued \\"obedience\\" to the teachings of their church above intellectual autonomy, which made them less inclined to enter scientific careers. Catholic sociologistsThomas F. O'Dea, The American Catholic Dilemma: An Inquiry into the Intellectual Life, New York, N.Y., 1958Frank L. Christ and Gerard Sherry (Editors), American Catholicism and the Intellectual Ideal, New York, N.Y., 1961 had come to the same conclusions.Gerhard Lenski, The Religious Factor, pp. 283-284 Lenski traced these differences back to the Reformation and the Catholic church's reaction to it. In Lenski's view, the Reformation encouraged intellectual autonomy among Protestants, in particular Anabaptists, Puritans, Pietists, Methodists, and Presbyterians. In the Middle Ages, there had been tendencies toward intellectual autonomy, as exemplified in men like Erasmus. But after the Reformation, the Catholic church leaders increasingly identified these tendencies with Protestantism and heresy and demanded that Catholics be obedient and faithful to ecclesiastical discipline. In Lenski's opinion, his study showed that these differences between Protestants and Catholics survived to the present day. As a consequence, \\"none of the predominantly and devoutly Catholic nations in the modern world can be classified as a leading industrial nation. Some Catholic nations - such as France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile - are quite highly industrialized, but none of them are leaders in the technological and scientific fields, nor do they seem likely to become so. Recently [1963] some Brazilian Catholic social scientists compared their country's progress with that of the United States and concluded that the chief factor responsible for the differential rates of development is the religious heritage of the two nations.\\"Gerhard Lenski, The Religious Factor, pp. 347-349 =Ecological-evolutionary theory= In subsequent publications (Power and Privilege, 1966; Human Societies, 1970; (in its 12th edition ) and Ecological- Evolutionary Theory, 2006* ), Lenski built on the foundations of evolutionary theory laid in the 18th century by A.R.J. Turgot, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and Thomas Malthus, and in the 19th and 20th centuries by Lewis Henry Morgan, Leslie White, and Charles Darwin and the many biological evolutionists following him, to propose a more contemporary ecological and evolutionary theory of societal development from the Stone Age to the present. He has viewed the cumulation of information, especially technological information, as the most basic and most powerful factor in the evolution of human societies (though not the only one, as some of his critics have claimed). Lenski has argued that the evolution of cultural information is an extension of the evolution of genetic information with the characteristics of human societies being the product of the interaction of both genetic and cultural influences. Members of any given society are united by a shared and partially distinctive culture and networks of social relationships with one another. These ties vary in intensity and distinctiveness depending on the magnitude of the society's store of information and the extent of contacts with other societies. With the acquisition of signals, and later, symbols, the ancestors of modern humans gained the critically important ability to share information acquired through individual experience. These and other later advances in the technologies of communication and transportation laid the foundations for major developments in political and economic systems, social inequality, science, ideology, and other spheres of life.Ecological-Evolutionary Theory, Part I; Human Societies, 12th ed., ch. 1-4 Lenski's theory has been well received. A former president of the American Political Science Association, Heinz Eulau, described Power and Privilege as a \\"masterpiece of comparative social analysis\\" and Ralf Dahrendorf referred to it as \\"an imaginative and substantial work [and] an indispensable guide.\\"Reviews of Power and Privilege, American Sociological Review, vol. 61, pp. 482‚Äì5 Sociological Theory devoted an issue of the journal to commentaries on, and appreciations of, his work (vol. 22, no. 2, June, 2004). One feature of Lenski's work that has won fairly wide acceptance among sociologists, as reflected in its incorporation into leading introductory textbooks in the discipline, is his ecological and evolutionary typology of human societies first proposed in Power and Privilege and enhanced later in Human Societies and other publications This typology is based on a combination of two elements: (1) the kind of environment to which the society must adapt, and (2) its level of technological development. In its most basic form, Lenski identifies seven types of societies: * Societies of hunters and gatherers * Horticultural societies * Agricultural or agrarian societies * Industrial societies * Fishing societies * Herding societies * Maritime societies. These types are often combined in various ways (for example, industrializing horticultural and agrarian societies, such as Ghana and Brazil in the late 20th century) and can be usefully subdivided into more or less advanced (e.g., simple and advanced horticultural societies). An important feature of Lenski's theory has been his emphasis on the need for a broadly inclusive approach in theory building. In a 1988 article, he argued that macrosociological theory should be based on our knowledge of the entire universe of human societies, past as well as present, and should seek to explain the major features of that universe, both its uniformities and its variations. This is undoubtedly a feature of the theory that many sociologists find troubling and unattractive because of the tradition developed in American sociology in the twentieth century of focusing theory and research on one's own society during a limited time period (i.e., American society in the 20th century) or a handful of societies (e.g., modern industrial societies) during an equally limited span of time. =Critique of Marxism= Another notable feature of Lenski's work has been his interest in Marxist societies. This grew out of his concern for the forces shaping societal development. Karl Marx, who had a major influence on sociological thought in the mid-twentieth century, had a very optimistic view of human nature that is reflected in his belief in the inevitability of communism in the future when the governing principle in human societies would be \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\\" Lenski viewed the Marxist societies of the 20th century as important, but too often neglected, social experiments that put Marx's view of human nature to the test and found it wanting.Gerhard Lenski, Patrick Nolan, Jean Lenski, Human Societies, 7th ed., 1995, chapter 15 His earlier work in the 1950s on status inconsistency (i.e. social class divisions and ethnic tension and discrimination) had received a positive reception among a number of influential Eastern European sociologists who found it a much more effective tool than the communist party's official model for analyzing and understanding the realities of social inequality in their societies, while at the same time providing a useful tool for challenging an increasingly unacceptable Communist social order.Birgitta Nedelmann and Piotr Sztomka (eds.), Sociology in Europe: In Search of Identity (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1993), p. 155Kazimierz Slomczynski, Zmniejszanie Nierownosci Spolecznych a Rozbieznosc Czynnikow Statusu (Status Inconsistency and the Reduction of Social Inequalities) Studia Socjologiczne, 56 (1), pp. 35‚Äì46  See also   Kardashev scale Gerhard Lenski  References External links *Gerhard Lenski's Ecological- Evolutionary Social Theory People from Washington, D.C. 1924 births 2015 deaths American sociologists American people of German descent Neoevolutionists Theories of history University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faculty ","title":"Gerhard Lenski"},{"id":"1791719","text":"Marano as a surname has noble Italian origin, derives from last name Marani of Vicenza that came to Naples in the 16th century with Francesco Antonio buried in the church of Sant'Antonelli to Caponapoli in the ancient center of Naples city.

These molecules can be organic (chemoorganotrophs) or inorganic (chemolithotrophs). The chemotroph designation is in contrast to phototrophs, which use solar energy. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic. Chemotrophs are found in ocean floors where sunlight cannot reach them because of the great depth and all the levels of water inbetween them and the sun. They evolved to not be dependent on solar energy. Ocean floors often contain underwater volcanos that can provide heat as a substitute for sunlight's warmth. Chemoautotroph Chemoautotrophs (or chemotrophic autotroph) (Greek: Chemo (œáŒ∑ŒºŒµŒØŒ±) = chemical, auto (ŒµŒ±œÖœÑœåœÇ) = self, troph (œÑœÅŒøœÜŒÆ) = nourishment), in addition to deriving energy from chemical reactions, synthesize all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Chemoautotrophs can use inorganic electron sources such as hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, ferrous iron, molecular hydrogen, and ammonia or organic sources. Most chemoautotrophs are extremophiles, bacteria or archaea that live in hostile environments (such as deep sea vents) and are the primary producers in such ecosystems. Chemoautotrophs generally fall into several groups: methanogens, sulfur oxidizers and reducers, nitrifiers, anammox bacteria, and thermoacidophiles. An example of one of these prokaryotes would be Sulfolobus. Chemolithotrophic growth can be dramatically fast, such as Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus with a doubling time around one hour. The term \\"chemosynthesis\\", coined in 1897 by Wilhelm Pfeffer, originally was defined as the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances in association with autotrophy‚Äîwhat would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would include also the chemoorganoautotrophy, that is, it can be seen as a synonym of chemoautotrophy. Chemoheterotroph Chemoheterotrophs (or chemotrophic heterotrophs) (Gr: Chemo (œáŒ∑ŒºŒØŒ±) = chemical, hetero (·ºïœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ) = (an)other, troph (œÑœÅŒøœÜŒπŒ¨) = nourishment) are unable to fix carbon to form their own organic compounds. Chemoheterotrophs can be chemolithoheterotrophs, utilizing inorganic electron sources such as sulfur, or chemoorganoheterotrophs, utilizing organic electron sources such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Most animals and fungi are examples of chemoheterotrophs, obtaining most of their energy from O2. Halophiles are chemoheterotrophs. Schmidt-Rohr, K.

The electron conserved from this reaction reduces the respiratory chain and can be thus used in the synthesis of ATP by forward electron transport or NADH by reverse electron transport, replacing or augmenting traditional phototrophism. *In general, iron-oxidizing bacteria can exist only in areas with high ferrous iron concentrations, such as new lava beds or areas of hydrothermal activity. Most of the ocean is devoid of ferrous iron, due to both the oxidative effect of dissolved oxygen in the water and the tendency of bacteria to take up the iron. *Lava beds supply bacteria with ferrous iron straight from the Earth's mantle, but only newly formed igneous rocks have high enough levels of ferrous iron. In addition, because oxygen is necessary for the reaction, these bacteria are much more common in the upper ocean, where oxygen is more abundant. *What is still unknown is how exactly iron bacteria extract iron from rock. It is accepted that some mechanism exists that eats away at the rock, perhaps through specialized enzymes or compounds that bring more FeO to the surface. It has been long debated about how much of the weathering of the rock is due to biotic components and how much can be attributed to abiotic components. *Hydrothermal vents also release large quantities of dissolved iron into the deep ocean, allowing bacteria to survive. In addition, the high thermal gradient around vent systems means a wide variety of bacteria can coexist, each with its own specialized temperature niche. *Regardless of the catalytic method used, chemoautotrophic bacteria provide a significant but frequently overlooked food source for deep sea ecosystems - which otherwise receive limited sunlight and organic nutrients. Manganese-oxidizing bacteria also make use of igneous lava rocks in much the same way; by oxidizing manganous manganese (Mn2+) into manganic (Mn4+) manganese. Manganese is more scarce than iron oceanic crust, but is much easier for bacteria to extract from igneous glass. In addition, each manganese oxidation donates two electrons to the cell versus one for each iron oxidation, though the amount of ATP or NADH that can be synthesised in couple to these reactions varies with pH and specific reaction thermodynamics in terms of how much of a Gibbs free energy change there is during the oxidation reactions versus the energy change required for the formation of ATP or NADH, all of which vary with concentration, pH etc. Much still remains unknown about manganese-oxidizing bacteria because they have not been cultured and documented to any great extent.

The Canada 2016 Census put the population at 790, a drop of 1.5% from 802 in 2011. The town is named for Frank Watson, an American-born trapper and prospector, who settled in the area at the end of the nineteenth century.http://www.yukoninfo.com/watson-lake- history/ Watson Lake is near the Liard River, at the junction of the Robert Campbell Highway and the Alaska Highway. The Cassiar Highway's northern end is west of Watson Lake. The town is also served by the Watson Lake Airport; the airport was formerly served by Canadian Pacific Airlines and other local and regional airlines, but now only provides corporate and charter services. Watson Lake is the main centre of the small forestry industry in Yukon and has been a service centre for the mining industry, especially for the Cassiar asbestos mine in northern British Columbia and the Cantung tungsten mine on the Yukon-Northwest Territories border in the Mackenzie Mountains. Tourist attractions in Watson Lake include the Northern Lights Centre www.northernlightscentre and the much-imitated original Signpost Forest. The Signpost Forest was started in 1942 by a homesick U.S. Army G.I. working on the Alaska Highway, who put up a sign with the name of his home town and the distance. Others followed suit and the tradition continues to this day. As of August 2010 there are more than 76,000 signs of various types depicting locations across the world.

Like Newmarket, Aurora was much smaller in size and population than other southern York Region municipalities, which benefited from connections to GO Transit and the Toronto Transit Commission. Aurora Transit provided feeder service to GO Transit commuter trains and buses as well as community bus service to town's major destinations. A fare arrangement between Aurora Transit and GO Transit allowed passengers to use Aurora Transit tickets on GO Transit 'route B' buses that provided local service on Yonge Street, provided the entire trip was within Aurora city limits (GO Transit zone 63). Passengers travelling to the neighboring Oak Ridges or Newmarket or (Zones 62 or 64) could still use Aurora Transit tickets with a cash supplement. On August 30, 1998 Aurora Transit restructured its services into a single route with service in the southern part of the town provided by Richmond Hill Transit. At the same time Newmarket Transit route 77/11 was extended south on Bayview Avenue to connect with Aurora Transit's only route at Bayview Shopping Centre. Aurora Transit ended its operations on September 4, 1999, when the transit service in the town was transferred to Newmarket Transit. The latter became part of the York Region Transit on January 1, 2001 when the four regional transit systems were merged.

Volume 3 was recorded at Sound On Sound, New York City, November 11 & 15, 1993; mixed at DSW Mastering Studios, NYC, and released in 1994. The album follows the tradition of pointing fingers at Broadway's latest. But according to Alessandrini in the liner notes, the album almost didn't make the cut. After twelve years, he was ready to quit, but new shows came along and practically offered themselves to parodies. He also mentions that FB has expanded to spoof the less successful musicals (assuming, of course, that a lot of people have heard of them). All the \\"new\\" lyrics are (as always) by Gerard Alesandrini. Volume 3 spoofs shows like Miss Saigon, Grand Hotel, Blood Brothers, and Kiss of the Spider Woman and stars like Ethel Merman, Michael Crawford, Carol Channing, Robert Goulet, and Dustin Hoffman. Additionally this album features the real Carol Channing as special guest vocal on track #01.

History The custom of producing originated during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. In their earliest forms, were small handkerchief sized pieces of square material, containing 1000 knots or stitches embroidered to strengthen the material, the implication being that this strength was passed along to the man carrying it. In general, and later varieties one thousand stitch belts were believed to confer courage, good luck and immunity from injury (especially bullets) to their wearers. Some Japanese soldiers rejected the belief that the could protect them from harm, instead believing that the amulet would allow them to inflict the greatest damage upon the enemy before offering their own lives up in battle. Others in the military wore the as a memento and a keepsake of the women who had given it to them. Production could be made by a soldier's mother, sister or wife, who would stand near their local temple, train station or department store and ask any female passerby to sew in a stitch or knot. During the height of WWII, women's organisations would gather to produce en masse in order to meet demand. These were then placed in , or comfort bags, and were sent overseas to soldiers. According to tradition, any woman born in the year of the Tiger could sew either twelve stitches or a number of stitches identical to her age. Some belts were lined with the woman's hair, or the hair of multiple women, as an added form of protection, a custom that originated in folk beliefs on the island of .

He is normally imagined as a dragon or serpent. Unlike his female consort, Mari, there are very few remaining legends about Sugaar. The basic purpose of his existence is to periodically join with Mari in the mountains to generate the storms. In one myth Sugaar seduces a Scottish princess in the village of Mundaka to father the mythical first Lord of Biscay, Jaun Zuria. This legend is believed to be a fabrication made to legitimize the Lordship of Biscay as a separate state from Navarre, because there is no historical account of such a lord. Only the fact that the delegates of Mundaka were attributed with the formal privilege of being the first to vote in the Biltzar (Parliament) of the province may look as unlikely indication of the partial veracity of this legend.  Etymology  The name Suga(a)r is derived from suge (serpent) and -ar (male), thus \\"male serpent\\".Trask, L. The History of Basque, Routledge 1997 The suggestions of a formation based on su (fire) and gar (flame), thus yielding \\"flame of fire\\" are considered folk etymology. Sugoi, another name of the same deity, has two possible interpretations, either a suge + o[h]i (former, \\"old serpent\\") or su + goi (\\"high fire\\"). There is no likely etymology for the third name of this god, Maju.  Local legends on Sugaar  *In Ataun he is said to have two homes: in the caves of Amunda and Atarreta. He is said to have been witnessed crossing the sky in form of fire-sickle, what is considered presage of storms. In this area is also said that Sugaar punishes the children that disobey their parents. *In Azkoitia Sugaar is clearly identified with Maju. He meets Mari on Fridays (the day of the akelarre or sabbat), conceiving then the storms. *In Betelu Sugaar is known as Suarra and considered a demon. There they say that he travels through the sky in the shape of a fireball, between the mountains Balerdi and Elortalde.

A single- engine, two-seat biplane based on the Heinkel He 50, the D1A was produced by Aichi for the Imperial Japanese Navy, remaining in service as a trainer at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The D1A was produced in two variants, the D1A1 (Navy Type 94 Carrier Bomber), and the D1A2 (Navy Type 96 Carrier Bomber, sometimes referred to as the D2A). Design and development The D1A came out of the Imperial Japanese Navy's need for an advanced carrier-based dive bomber, and in late 1934 the IJN ordered the finalisation of the Aichi AB-9 design which was produced as the early model D1A1. However, the D1A1 was not designed by aircraft company (later Aichi Kokuki), but by Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke at the request of the Aichi company. The initial version designed by Heinkel was the He 50, a similar model equipped with floats instead of landing gear. The subsequent model, the He 66 was provided to Aichi who immediately began production of it as the D1A1. The design of the D1A, based on the Heinkel He 66, an export model of the He 50, was designed as a biplane constructed of metal, with a fabric covering, a fixed landing gear and a conventional type tail landing skid. Original models had 365 kW (490 hp) engines and it was not until later models that more powerful 433 kW (580 hp) engines were included in the construction. Operational history The D1A was primarily used in the Second Sino-Japanese War and up to the time Japan entered World War II in 1941. At the beginning of the Pacific War, all of the remaining D1A1s were decommissioned and most of the D1A2s were retired from the front lines and served primarily in training units. The exception was 68 of the D1A2 model that operated as a second-line support until being retired in 1942.

It is located at 350 U.S. Highway 1, Vero Beach, Florida. It was founded in 1929, when Waldo Sexton and Arthur G. McKee purchased an tropical hammock along the Indian River. Tropical landscape architect William Lyman Phillips was hired to design its streams, ponds, and trails. Its indigenous vegetation was augmented with ornamental plants and seeds from around the world. In 1932, they proceeded to open the garden, then known as McKee Jungle Gardens, as a tourist attraction. Although the Garden was successful for several decades, it shut down in 1976, and most of its land was sold for development. The site remained vacant for twenty years until the Indian River Land Trust purchased it in 1995. The current Garden was formally dedicated in 2001. It is now a Florida landmark and on January 7, 1998, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places under its former name of McKee Jungle Gardens.

Founded in 1978 the company began manufacturing a new agricultural aircraft derived from the S-2B aircraft (designed by founder Leland Snow's previous company, Snow Aeronautical). Designated Model AT-300 Air Tractor, the new aircraft first flew in 1973. In 2004, the 2,000th Air Tractor aircraft was delivered.Air Tractor website, accessed 07 Feb 2008 From 2011 through 2018, Air Tractor consistently delivered more turboprop-powered fixed wing general aviation aircraft than any other manufacturer; of 601 total worldwide general aviation turboprop deliveries in 2018, 141 (23%) were Air Tractors. History Leland Snow began designing his first airplane, the S-1, in 1951. The 23-year-old Snow completed test flights with the S-1 in 1953. Snow's S-1 flew dusting and spraying jobs in the Texas Rio Grande Valley and in Nicaragua until 1957. He followed-up the S-1 with the models S-2A and S-2B, which were built when Snow moved to production facilities in Olney, Texas in 1958. In 1965, Leland Snow sold his company to Rockwell-Standard and was appointed a Vice President of the Aero Commander division. During this time, the Model S-2R was developed and named the Thrush. The first 100 Thrush aircraft were built at the Olney Division before the plant was closed and Thrush production moved to Georgia in 1970. More than 500 aircraft were produced under Snow Aeronautical Corporation and Rockwell-Standard in Olney. Snow resigned from Rockwell and devoted the next two years designing the Air Tractor. Construction began in 1972 on the AT-300, which later became the AT-301. Air Tractor's first turbine model, the AT-302, was introduced in 1977. Sixteen years later, Air Tractor delivered its 1,100th airplane and soon began expanding the Olney plant for increased capacity. Today, Air Tractor produces a line of aircraft that includes capacity planes powered by Pratt & Whitney piston or turbine engines.

The nearest communities are Wykoff, to the northwest, and Preston, to the northeast. History The town of Forestville was settled in 1852 and organized in 1855, receiving this name in honor of Forest Henry, the first probate judge of Fillmore County. Henry settled in Forestville in 1854. The town was incorporated in 1891 and had a post office from 1855 until 1902. Brothers-in-law William and Felix Meighen were some of the first settlers. Felix saw the need for a general store and stocked it with $700 worth of goods from Galena in October 1853. As more people arrived in Minnesota territory, the town gained a blacksmith shop, a cabinet shop, saw mills, farms, stores, grist mills and hotels. The town's population began to drop after the railroad bypassed Forestville in 1868; many families began leaving for more prosperous areas. By 1880, the town's population was only 55 and most businesses had closed. As families left town, the Meighen family began buying up cheap property, and by 1889, they owned the entire town and its surrounding area. By the early 1900s, even the Meighen family had left Forestville, and their general store's doors were closed in 1910, marking the end of the town's life. State Park In 1949 the Minnesota State Legislature authorized the creation of Forestville State Park, with the intent to preserve what remained of the abandoned townsite. Mystery Cave was added to the state park in 1987. Today Historic Forestville is operated as a historic site of the Minnesota Historical Society.

PdCl2(1,5-cyclooctadiene). Palladium(II) =Alkene complexes= Unlike Ni(II), but similar to Pt(II), Pd(II) halides form a variety of alkene complexes. The premier example is dichloro(1,5‚Äêcyclooctadiene)palladium. In this complex, the diene is easily displaced, which makes it a favored precursor to catalysts. In the industrially important Wacker process, ethylene is converted to acetaldehyde via nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on a Pd(II)-ethylene intermediate followed by formation of a vinyl alcohol complex. Fullerene ligands also bind with palladium(II). Catalytic cycle for the industrially significant Wacker Process for oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde. Palladium(II) acetate and related compounds are common reagents because the carboxylates are good leaving groups with basic properties. For example palladium trifluoroacetate has been demonstrated to be effective in aromatic decarboxylation: =Allyl complexes= The iconic complex in this series is allylpalladium chloride dimer (APC). Allyl compounds with suitable leaving groups react with palladium(II) salts to pi-allyl complexes having hapticity 3. These intermediates too react with nucleophiles for example carbanions derived from malonates or with amines in allylic amination as depicted below Reagents: triethyl phosphite ligand, DBU (is reported to absorb the amine protons that would otherwise trigger isomerization) in THF :Allylic amination Allylpalladium intermediates also feature in the Trost asymmetric allylic alkylation and the Carroll rearrangement and an oxo variation in the Saegusa oxidation. =Palladium-carbon sigma-bonded complexes= Various organic groups can bound to palladium and form stable sigma-bonded complexes. The stability of the bonds in terms of bond dissociation energy follows the trend: Pd-Alkynyl > Pd-Vinyl ‚âà Pd-Aryl > Pd-Alkyl and the metal-carbon bond length changes in the opposite direction: Pd-Alkynyl < Pd-Vinyl ‚âà Pd-Aryl < Pd- Alkyl.V. P. Ananikov et al., Organometallics, 2005, 24, 715.  Palladium(0) compounds Zerovalent Pd(0) compounds include tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). These complexes react with halocarbon R-X in oxidative addition to R-Pd-X intermediates with covalent Pd-C bonds. This chemistry forms the basis of a large class of organic reactions called coupling reactions (see palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions). An example is the Sonogashira reaction: :Reaction mechanism Sonogashira reaction Organopalladium(IV) The first organopalladium(IV) compound was described in 1986. This complex is Me3Pd(IV)(I)bpy (bpy = bidentate 2,2'-bipyridine ligand) It was synthesized by oxidative addition of methyl iodide to Me2Pd(II)bpy. Palladium compounds owe their reactivity to the ease of interconversion between Pd(0) and palladium(II) intermediates. There is no conclusive evidence however for the involvement of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) conversions in palladium mediated organometallic reactions. One reaction invoking such mechanism was described in 2000 and concerned a Heck reaction. This reaction was accompanied by a 1,5-hydrogen shift in the presence of amines: :Heck Reaction Wang 2000 The hydride shift was envisaged as taking place through a Pd(IV) metallacycle: :Heck Reaction Wang 2000 Mechanism In related work the intermediate associated with the hydride shift remains Pd(II):C-H Activation and Palladium Migration within Biaryls under Heck Reaction Conditions Gunter Karig, Maria-Teresa Moon, Nopporn Thasana, and Timothy Gallagher Org.

Wallace, was a lawyer and a Union general in the American Civil War, considered by Ulysses S. Grant to be one of the Union's greatest generals. Early life Wallace was born in Urbana, Ohio on July 8, 1821,the son of John and Mary Lamme Wallace. In 1840, his family moved to Mount Morris, Illinois for a better education where Rock River Seminary was located. Education and Career Although he planned to study law with Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, he joined Theophilus Lyle Dickey's practice in Ottawa, Illinois, instead. (Dickey was a friend of Lincoln's and would eventually be a justice of the Illinois Supreme Court.) Wallace became licensed in law in 1846 and that same year he joined the 1st Illinois Infantry as a private. He rose to the rank second lieutenant and adjutant and participated in the Battle of Buena Vista along with a few other minor engagements. After this brief experience in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he became district attorney in 1853. =Civil War service and death= At the start of the Civil War, Wallace volunteered as a private with the 11th Illinois Infantry, which was assembled in Springfield. He was then elected the unit's colonel. He rose up the ranks and commanded a brigade of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand's division of Grant's Army of the Tennessee at the Battle of Fort Donelson in 1862. During the battle much of McClernand's division had been driven back with heavy losses and Wallace's coolness under fire was especially noted. Brig. Gen. Lew Wallace described the colonel as looking like a \\"farmer coming from a hard day's plowing\\". After this first time meeting upon the Fort Donelson battlefield, the two quickly learned each possessed the same surname and had commanded their respective states' 11th regiments, prompting Lew Wallace to muse the coincidence must have caused \\"great profanity in the army post office\\".Cooling, p. 178. For his service at Fort Donelson Colonel Wallace was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers. During the expedition to Savannah, Tennessee Maj. Gen. Charles Ferguson Smith injured his leg and was forced to turn over command of his division to Wallace.Wallace, p. vi> At the Battle of Shiloh, Wallace was a new division commander, yet he managed to withstand six hours of assaults by the Confederates, directly next to the famous Hornet's Nest, or Sunken Road. When his division was finally surrounded, he ordered a withdrawal and many escaped, but he was wounded and only later found barely alive on the battlefield by his troops. They carried him to his wife, who coincidentally had arrived for a surprise visit to her husband on the very morning of the battle. She helped tend to him on the way back to General Grant's headquarters in the Cherry Mansion in Savannah, Tennessee. He died three days later in his wife's arms; his last words were \\"We meet in heaven.\\" He is buried in LaSalle County, Illinois, in Ottawa. He was the brother of future Brevet Brigadier General Martin R. M. Wallace. Personal Life In 1851 he married Dickey's daughter, Martha Ann. Tribute Wallace County, Kansas, was named in his honor in 1868.

Movado traces its origins to La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland.  History  Movado was founded as LAI Ditescheim & Freres SA in 1881 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, by L√©opold Achille Isidore Ditesheim. In 1905, the company changed its name to Movado. In 1983, the company was purchased by North American Watch Corp, founded by Gedalio Grinberg, a Cuban-born Jew, who fled Fidel Castro's Marxist Revolution in 1960 with his family. His son, Efraim Grinberg, is the chairman and chief executive officer of Movado Group, Inc. The North American President of Movado is Alan Chinich. In 2006, Movado celebrated its 125th year of watchmaking. On February 23, 1999, Movado Group, Inc. completed the sale of Piaget business to VLG North America, Inc., for approximately $30 million. In August 2018, Movado acquired watch startup MVMT, which was founded in 2013, for more than $100 million.

Brooklyn Museum = Museum Watch = The company markets the Museum Watch, designed by the American designer Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. Influenced by Bauhaus, the watch dial has a very simple design defined by a solitary dot at 12, symbolizing the sun at high noon. It was first made by an American importer of Swiss watches called \\"Vacheron & Constantin-LeCoultre Watches Inc.\\" (not the Swiss watchmaker Vacheron Constantin), and later produced by Movado. Horwitt's dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, the first watch dial awarded this distinction. Movado finally settled with Horwitt in 1975 with a payment of $29,000 ($128,000 in 2015 dollars).

Biography Sturtevant was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Charles Lyon [1867-1934] and Bessie (Dillon) [1869-1917] Sturtevant. The duty of Sturtevant's crew was to fly escort for merchantmen crossing the North Sea. On 15 February 1918 Sturtevant was one of an international crew of four in a Curtiss H-12B flying boat. The flight officer that day was Claude Chester Purdy, a Canadian enlisted in the Royal Naval Service. Sturtevant, as second officer, was gunner. Two others in the plane were British air mechanic 1st class Sidney James Hollidge and British boy mechanic Arthur Hector Stephenson. With another plane from the same unit, piloted by a South African named Faux, their assignment was to escort a convoy of ships carrying beef between the Netherlands and Britain. The two aircraft were attacked by a group of ten German seaplanes. The group split in half, with five seaplanes pursuing each of the flying boats. Faux managed to elude his attackers and escaped to the west and England, but Purdy was forced south towards the coast of Belgium. As if the situation were not dire enough, another group of German aircraft, led by Oberleutnant Friedrich Christiansen, air ace, entered the fray. Christiansen shot down the flying boat and it fell in flames into the North Sea. Christiansen later told Sturtevant's father that he circled the area and observed three crew members waving and clinging to the wreckage, but that he was unable to rescue them because it was a dangerous situation. Faux reported the attack at Felixstowe, where there was only one aircraft not otherwise engaged. That aircraft attempted a rescue but was damaged on takeoff. By the time another attempt could be made, any sign of the flying ship and its crew had disappeared. Sturtevant was the first aviator in either the US Army or the Navy to be brought down in action.http://www.militarian.com/threads/albert- dillon-sturtevant.8582/) Sturtevant was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously.

He was the Archbishop of Olinda and Recife, serving from 1964 to 1985, during the military regime of the country. C√¢mara was an advocate of liberation theology. He did social and political work for the poor and for human rights and democracy during the military regime. C√¢mara preached for a church closer to the disfavoured people and for non-violence. He is quoted as having said, \\"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist.\\"Quote: \\"Quando dou comida aos pobres, chamam-me de santo. Quando pergunto por que eles s√£o pobres, chamam-me de comunista.\\" ‚Äì cited in Zildo Rocha, Helder, O Dom: uma vida que marcou os rumos da Igreja no Brasil (Helder, the Gift: A Life that Marked the Course of the Church in Brazil), Page 53, Editora Vozes, 2000, . ‚Äì 208 pages Early life and education He was born H√©lder Pessoa C√¢mara in Fortaleza, Cear√°, in the poor Northeast Region of Brazil. His father was an accountant and his mother was a primary school teacher. He was educated in local Catholic schools and entered seminary in 1923. Career H√©lder C√¢mara in 1984 He was ordained a priest in 1931, with direct authorization of the Holy See over his premature age.Santana, Ana Lucia. ¬´Dom Helder Camara¬ª. InfoEscola. Retrieved 17 September 2016. (Portuguese). C√¢mara was named auxiliary bishop of Rio de Janeiro by Pope Pius XII on 3 March 1952. During his first years as a priest he was a supporter of the far-right organization Integralismo, an ideological choice that he later rejected. He also founded two social organizations: the Cear√° Legion of Work, in 1931, and the Women Workers' Catholic Union, in 1933. On 12 March 1964, Pope Paul VI appointed him Archbishop of Olinda e Recife. During his tenure, C√¢mara was informally called the 'Bishop of the slums' for his clear position on the side of the urban poor. With other clerics, he encouraged peasants to free themselves from their conventional fatalistic outlook by studying the gospels in small groups and proposing the search for social change from their readings. He was active in the formation of the Brazilian Bishops‚Äô Conference in 1952, and served as its first general secretary until 1964. In 1959 he founded Banco da Provid√™ncia in Rio de Janeiro, a philanthropic organization to fight poverty and social injustice by facilitating the contraction of loans by poorer populations. He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council and played a significant role in drafting the Pastoral Constitution on The Church in the Modern World. On 16 November 1965, a few days before the Council ended, 40 bishops led by bishop H√©lder C√¢mara met at night in the Catacombs of Domitilla outside Rome. They celebrated the Eucharist and signed a document under the title of the Pact of the Catacombs. In 13 points, they challenged their brother bishops to live lives of evangelical poverty: without honorific titles, privileges, and worldly ostentation. They taught that \\"the collegiality of the bishops finds its supreme evangelical realization in jointly serving the two-thirds of humanity who live in physical, cultural, and moral misery\\". They called for openness \\"to all, no matter what their beliefs\\". Entrance to the branch of the Banco da Provid√™ncia located in the Rio de Janeiro CathedralUnder the guidance of archbishop H√©lder C√¢mara, the Roman Catholic church in Brazil became an outspoken critic of the 1964-85 military dictatorship and a powerful movement for social change.Bellos, Alex. \\"Helder Camara\\" (obit), The Guardian, August 31, 1999 C√¢mara spoke out and wrote about the implications of using violence to repress rebellion resulting from poverty and injustice in other venues than Brazil. Traditionalist Catholics urged the military government to arrest C√¢mara for his support of land reform and C√¢mara's colleague, Father Ant√¥nio Henrique Pereira Neto, was murdered by unknown conservative forces. A proponent of liberation theology, he was Archbishop of the Diocese of Olinda and Recife from 1964 to 1985, during a period when the country had a series of military rulers. Liberation theology politicised the church's charitable work and brought criticisms that it was encouraging the armed revolutionary struggles that swept Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s. He published Spiral of Violence (1971), a short tract written when the United States was immersed in a still escalating Vietnam War. It is distinctive for linking structural injustice (Level 1 violence) with escalating rebellion (Level 2 violence) and repressive reaction (Level 3 violence). In it, C√¢mara called on the youth of the world to take steps to break the spiral, saying their elders became addicted to those escalating steps. By the early 21st century, this book had been out of print in the United Kingdom for about 20 years. He died in Recife on 27 August 1999 at the age of 90. Controversies C√¢mara had some controversial views, endorsing the position of the Orthodox church that spouses who were abandoned should be allowed to remarry within the Church.Come i progressisti non vinsero al Concilio / Una recensione di Roma, Due del Mattino di Monsignor H√©lder C√¢mara / di Massimo Introvigne, CESNUR Official Website (Italian) He criticized Pope Paul VI's removal of artificial contraception from the purview of Vatican II as \\"a mistake\\" meant to \\"torture spouses, to disturb peace of many homes\\", \\"a new condemnation of Galileo\\", \\"the death of the Council\\" and \\"the practical denial of collegiality\\". However, by Humanae Vitae, he had changed his mind about contraception, being the first person to telegram the Vatican's Secretariat of State praising the controversial encyclical.Blessed Paul VI, the Pope who led the Church's barque in troubled waters, Catholic News Agency In his famous interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, he also stated that, despite his support for non-violence, he did not oppose violent tactics: \\"And I respect a lot priests with rifles on their shoulders; I never said that to use weapons against an oppressor is immoral or anti- Christian. But that's not my choice, not my road, not my way to apply the Gospels\\".Entrevistas hist√≥ricas: Oriana Fallaci entrevista dom Helder C√¢mara, Socialista Morena Website (Portuguese) C√¢mara identified himself as a socialist and not as a Marxist, and while disagreeing with Marxism, had Marxist sympathies. In the Oriana Fallaci interview he stated, \\"My socialism is special, its a socialism that respects the human person and goes back to the Gospels. My socialism it is justice.\\" He said, concerning Marx, that while he disagreed with his conclusions, he agreed with his analysis of the capitalist society. Legacy and honors *In 1973, C√¢mara was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC).Nobel Peace Prize nominations.

Smith Bonsai Collection, the largest public collection of tropical bonsai in the country. The collection has more bonsai on year-round display than any other public exhibit in the United States. Although there are 26 species represented in the collection, almost half the trees are species of ficus. The more than 100 specimen bonsai range from a huge buttonwood, estimated to be 200 years old, to a magnificent, twin-trunk Jaboticaba, originally styled by John Naka in 1973. Thousands of visitors flock to the bonsai pavilion during Garden of Lights to have their children's pictures taken with Heathcote the Bear. James J. Smith was an internationally recognized authority on bonsai who operated a wholesale bonsai nursery in Vero Beach, FL. He learned from some of the most famous bonsai masters in the world including John Naka and Toshio Saburomaru. For decades, Smith conducted a free monthly workshop at his Durastone Nursery on Old Dixie Highway. He was mentor to several generations of Florida bonsai artists. His bonsai are in numerous important collections around the world, and numerous books picture his trees and discuss his work. When he was in his 80s, he agreed to give most of his private collection to Heathcote if it could develop a suitable display area. Heathcote conducted a major fundraising campaign and developed a plan for a 10,000-square-foot garden complete with stone stands and a Japanese-influenced pavilion that is a favorite scene for weddings and garden parties.

It is bound by the River Thames to the east and Windsor Great Park to the west. Etymology The name originates from old English Windles-ore, Windlesora, or winch by the riverside.a b South S.R., The Book of Windsor, Barracuda Books, 1977. The village was originally called Windsor, until the (now larger) town of New Windsor, from the village, assumed the name. Windsor is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. History =Kingsbury= Old Windsor was once the site of an important palace of the Saxon Kings. The settlement is documented as a defended royal manor in Edward the Confessor's time, but archaeological evidence suggests royal connections had existed since at least the 9th century. The saxon royal site was excavated between 1953 and 1958, and the finds are at Reading Museum. Edward gave the manor to the Abbot of Westminster in 1066, but it was soon taken back into royal possession by William the Conqueror. Old Windsor was popular with the monarch because of its convenient location; near to the river for transport and Windsor Forest for hunting. Old Windsor was also an early minster location and market, probably associated with a lock, and important riverside mill complex. The Saxon palace was eventually superseded by the Norman Windsor Castle, at 'New' Windsor. The medieval manor house, however, became a popular royal hunting lodge while the castle was still a fortress rather than a comfortable residence. =The Beaumont Estate= At the southern end of the village, is the historic Beaumont Estate. First mention of the estate is recorded around the year 1300, when the estate, and much of the surrounding area was under the ownership of Hugo de Remenham. The estate was, at the time, known as Remenham, and occupied a larger area that it does now, stretching all the way down to the river, and including the historic pub, the Bells of Ouzeley. After changing hands a few times, the estate was bought by Henry Frederick Tynne who had the house redesigned in 1705 by architect James Gibbs, renamed it Bowman's Lodge. The estate was acquired in the mid-eighteenth century by Sophia, Duchess of Kent. In 1751 the estate was bought by the Duke of Roxburghe for his son, the Marquess of Beaumont, who renamed it Beaumont Lodge. It was bought in 1786 by Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India, and most notable resident of the estate, for ¬£12,000. In 1790, the owner Henry Griffith had Windsorian architect Henry Emlyn rebuild, and modify the house. The estate was sold in 1805 for ¬£14,000 to Viscount Ashbrook, a friend of George IV. After the Viscount's death in 1846, the Bells of Ouzeley pub was sold by his widow, and in 1854, she sold the estate to the Society of Jesus, who used it as Beaumont College. In 1861 it became the St. Stanislaus College, Beaumont; a Catholic boarding school for boys. In 1967, the school closed, and moved to merge with Stonyhurst College, in Lancashire. The estate was subsequently bought by the computer company ICL, and then by Hayley Conference Centres, in 2003. A chapel at Beaumont is said to be the inspiration for the chapel in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited. Waugh spent time in Windsor, whilst in the armed forces. =Churches= Parish Church, Old Windsor ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 597441 The parish of Old Windsor contains two Church of England churches: the parish Church of St Peter and St Andrew, and the Mission Church of St Luke. The Parish Church was probably built on the site of a chapel attached to the hunting lodge of Edward the Confessor. After the original building was destroyed by French soldiers, the church was rebuilt in 1218. In 1865, an extensive restoration plan was carried out by Giles Gilbert Scott which included the removal of a porch which had been added onto the building during the Georgian period. A spire was also built to replace the cupola, and three bells were added to the original five, dating from 1775. On Easter Day 2008, the church suffered a serious fire, but has since been restored. The original church of St Luke was built in 1867, but after falling into disrepair, was replaced by a newer building in the 1960s. The church contains a carpet which was bought in 1960 from Westminster Abbey, where it had been used during the coronation. Amenities =Pubs= The Fox and Castle at Old Windsor ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 603782 Old Windsor is home to five pubs (the Bells of Ouzeley, the Fox and Castle, the Jolly Gardeners, the Oxford Blue, and the Union Inn; and one members club, The Old Windsor Club. There are also a small number of local shops and several restaurants. =Schools= Old Windsor is home to two state schools ‚Äî King's Court First School and St Peter's Church of England Middle School ‚Äî and St John's Beaumont independent school. St John's Beaumont was opened in 1888, originally a preparatory school for the Jesuit public school, Beaumont College, which was also situated in Old Windsor. Beaumont College was closed in 1967. The Great Park Windsor Great Park is largely within the bounds of Old Windsor, including both the Royal and Cumberland Lodges. Famous people Old Windsor is, or has been, the home of several famous people, including: *Sir Elton John, who lives at Woodside on the edge of the Great Park *actress Geraldine McEwan, who was born in Old Windsor Location Old Windsor lies on the south bank of the River Thames, southeast of the town of Windsor. It is near to the villages of Englefield Green and Datchet, and is connected by a towpath to Old Windsor Lock. The parish church lies on the edge of the village by the river, at the site of the original settlement. =Transport links= Old Windsor is approximately 5 minutes' drive from Windsor and 20 minutes from London Heathrow Airport, and is near to the M4 and M25 motorways.

The marks at the bottom right indicate the 12 colonies that voted for independence. The Province of New York abstained. Richard Henry Lee proposed the resolution on June 7, 1776. The Lee Resolution (also known as \\"The Resolution for Independence\\") was the formal assertion passed by the Second Continental Congress on July 2, 1776 which resolved that the Thirteen Colonies in America were \\"free and independent States\\", separated from the British Empire and creating what became the United States of America. News of this act was published that evening in the Pennsylvania Evening Post and the next day in the Pennsylvania Gazette. The Declaration of Independence is the formal document which officially announced and explained the resolution, approved two days later on July 4, 1776. The resolution is named for Richard Henry Lee of Virginia who proposed it to Congress after receiving instructions and wording from the Fifth Virginia Convention and its President Edmund Pendleton. Lee's full resolution had three parts which were considered by Congress on June 7, 1776. Along with the independence issue, it also proposed to establish a plan for ensuing American foreign relations, and to prepare a plan of a confederation for the states to consider. Congress decided to address each of these three parts separately. Some sources indicate that Lee used the language from the Virginia Convention's instructions almost verbatim. Voting was delayed for several weeks on the first part of the resolution while state support and legislative instruction for independence were consolidated, but the press of events forced the other less-discussed parts to proceed immediately. On June 10, Congress decided to form a committee to draft a declaration of independence in case the resolution should pass. On June 11, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston were appointed as the Committee of Five to accomplish this. That same day, Congress decided to establish two other committees to develop the resolution's last two parts. The following day, another committee of five (John Dickinson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Benjamin Harrison V, and Robert Morris) was established to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers; a third committee was created, consisting of one member from each colony, to prepare a draft of a constitution for confederation of the states. The committee appointed to prepare a plan of treaties made its first report on July 18, largely in the writing of John Adams. A limited printing of the document was authorized, and it was reviewed and amended by Congress over the next five weeks. On August 27, the amended plan of treaties was referred back to the committee to develop instructions concerning the amendments, and Richard Henry Lee and James Wilson were added to the committee. Two days later, the committee was empowered to prepare further instructions and report back to Congress. The formal version of the plan of treaties was adopted on September 17. On September 24, Congress approved negotiating instructions for commissioners to obtain a treaty with France, based on the template provided in the plan of treaties; the next day, Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Thomas Jefferson were elected commissioners to the court of France.Milestones: 1776-1783: The Model Treaty, 1776, Department of State, Office of the Historian. from archive.org Alliance with France was considered vital if the war with Britain was to be won and the newly declared country was to survive. The committee drafting a plan of confederation was chaired by John Dickinson; they presented their initial results to Congress on July 12, 1776. Long debates followed on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures. The final draft of the Articles of Confederation was prepared during the summer of 1777 and approved by Congress for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate. It continued in use from that time onward, although it was not ratified by all states until four years later on March 1, 1781. Towards independence When the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, few colonists in British North America openly advocated independence from Great Britain. Support for independence grew steadily in 1776, especially after the publication of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense in January of that year. In the Second Continental Congress, the movement towards independence was guided principally by an informal alliance of delegates eventually known as the \\"Adams-Lee Junto\\", after Samuel Adams and John Adams of Massachusetts and Richard Henry Lee of Virginia. On May 15, 1776, the revolutionary Virginia Convention, then meeting in Williamsburg, passed a resolution instructing Virginia's delegates in the Continental Congress \\"to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain\\".Boyd, Evolution of the Text, 18; Maier, American Scripture, 63. For text of the May 15 Virginia resolution, see Yale.edu . In accordance with those instructions, on June 7, Richard Henry Lee proposed the resolution to Congress and it was seconded by John Adams. > Resolved, That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and > independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the > British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State > of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved. That it is > expedient forthwith to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign > Alliances. That a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted to the > respective Colonies for their consideration and approbation. Congress as a whole was not yet ready to declare independence at that moment, because the delegates from some of the colonies, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, had not yet been authorized to vote for independence.Maier, American Scripture, 42. Voting on the first clause of Lee's resolution was therefore postponed for three weeks while advocates of independence worked to build support in the colonial governments for the resolution.Maier, American Scripture, 43. Meanwhile, a Committee of Five was appointed to prepare a formal declaration so that it would be ready when independence, which almost everyone recognized was now inevitable, was approved. The committee prepared a declaration of independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, and presented it to Congress on June 28, 1776. Approval and declaration The declaration was set aside while the resolution of independence was debated for several days. The vote on the independence section of the Lee resolution had been postponed until Monday, July 1, when it was taken up by the Committee of the Whole. At the request of South Carolina, the resolution was not acted upon until the following day in the hope of securing unanimity. A trial vote had been tested where it was found that South Carolina and Pennsylvania were in the negative, with Delaware split in a tie between its two delegates. The vote was held on July 2, with critical changes happening between Monday and Tuesday. Edward Rutledge was able to persuade South Carolina delegates to vote yes, two Pennsylvania delegates were persuaded to be absent, and Caesar Rodney had been sent for through the night to break Delaware's tie, History of Delaware : 1609-1888: General history, by John Thomas Scharf so Lee's resolution of independence was approved by 12 of the 13 colonies. Delegates from the Colony of New York still lacked instructions to vote for independence, so they abstained on this vote, although the New York Provincial Congress voted on July 9 to \\"join with the other colonies in supporting\\" independence.Burnett, Continental Congress, 191. The Lee Resolution's passage was reported at the time as the colonies' definitive declaration of independence from Great Britain. The Pennsylvania Evening Post reported on July 2: > This day the CONTINENTAL CONGRESS declared the UNITED COLONIES FREE and > INDEPENDENT STATES.Pennsylvania Evening Post, July 2, 1776 The Pennsylvania Gazette followed suit the next day with its own brief report: > Yesterday, the CONTINENTAL CONGRESS declared the UNITED COLONIES FREE and > INDEPENDENT STATES.Pennsylvania Gazette, July 3, 1776 After passing the resolution of independence on July 2, Congress turned its attention to the text of the declaration. Over several days of debate, Congress made a number of alterations to the text, including adding the wording of Lee's resolution of independence to the conclusion. The final text of the declaration was approved by Congress on July 4 and sent off to be printed. John Adams wrote his wife Abigail on July 3 about the resolution of independence: > The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the > history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by > succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be > commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God > Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, > sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this > continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.Letter from John > Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776, \\"Had a Declaration\\" [electronic > edition].

Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard > University Press, 1963. Adams's prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated Independence Day on July 4, the date when the Declaration of Independence was approved, rather than on July 2, the date when the resolution of independence was adopted. The two latter parts of the Lee Resolution were not passed until months later. The second part regarding the formation of foreign alliances was approved in September 1776, and the third part regarding a plan of confederation was approved in November 1777 and finally ratified in 1781. =Congressional journal entries= The following are entries relating to the resolution of independence and the Declaration of Independence in the Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774‚Äì1789, from American Memory, published by the Library of Congress: *Friday, June 7, \\"certain resolutions respecting independency\\" are moved and seconded; discussion set for Saturday *Saturday, June 8, Congress considers the resolutions but postpones a decision *Monday, June 10, Congress postpones the first part of Lee's resolution for three weeks, and also decides to appoint \\"a committee to prepare a declaration to the effect of the said first resolution\\". *Tuesday, June 11, Congress establishes three committees to pursue the three part resolution, and names five members of the first \\"to prepare the declaration\\". *Wednesday, June 12, Congress appointments members of the other two committees.

Concept The concept developed in the 1930s when it was believed that a very fast bomber could simply outrun its enemies. Omitting defensive armament allowed for significant reduction in drag (there would be no turrets, gondolas or gun barrels protruding from the fuselage) as well as weight (no guns, ammunition or manning crew members would be required on board), resulting in improved performance. Adolf Hitler was a staunch supporter of the Schnellbomber and directed the Luftwaffe to only develop medium bombers, while the USA and British developed both twin-engine medium bombers and four-engine heavy bombers. Twin-engine medium bombers, while best adapted as the Schnellbomber, lacked the payload and range of heavy bombers which put them at considerable disadvantage for strategic bombing. In strategic bombing raids the Luftwaffe made do with medium bombers with limited fighter escort from the Messerschmitt Bf 109, due to the lack of a truly long-range fighter. The Allies by contrast used slow but heavily armed bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress deployed in combat box formation, with the long-range North American P-51 Mustang initially in escort and later in forward role conducting a \\"fighter sweep\\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters. Development The first aircraft adopted for the Schnellbomber role was the single-engined Heinkel He 70, but it soon was replaced by the twin-engined Dornier Do 17 in that role. In the 1937 air races in Switzerland the Do 17 won a number of speed records, apparently demonstrating the value of the concept. However, experience of the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that the Do 17's speed when loaded with military equipment was insufficient to escape interception, and armament had to be added to give it some defensive fighting capability. Bomber development temporarily outpaced fighter development in the 1930s. The last generation of biplane fighters (like the Gloster Gladiator and Polikarpov I-15) that had been placed in service during that decade could not catch the privately created Bristol Type 142 twin-engined light bomber prototype in 1935. However by the end of the 1930s, low-wing monoplane fighters like the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire had entered service, and they had the performance to catch up with the Schnellbomber, and dramatically outgun it by eight to one (only one gun would normally be able to fire back). The Do 17 suffered badly at the hands of the RAF during the Battle of Britain, and its production run ended in 1940. =Germany's quest for \\"fast bombers\\"= The Germans nevertheless persisted in their attempts to create newer Schnellbombers, as opposed to large bombers with heavy defensive armaments which were favored by the RAF and USAAF. Other aircraft recognized as Schnellbombers by the Luftwaffe were the Junkers Ju 88, the first to be custom-designed for the role, three years before the start of the war, the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse in 1943, and the jet-engined Arado Ar 234 Blitz (dubbed \\"the fastest bomber\\" ‚Äì \\"Schnellstbomber\\"). Several other Luftwaffe aircraft were originally designed as fast bombers, but entered service in other roles; these include the Heinkel He 219 as a night fighter, and the Dornier Do 335 ‚Äî meant to have a small, ventral weapons bay to accommodate droppable ordnance from the start ‚Äî as a new Zerst√∂rer heavy fighter, faster than any other piston-twin of World War II with a top speed of some 765 km/h (475 mph). The Bomber B high-speed medium bomber design competition for the Luftwaffe started in July 1939 was meant to create an updated design to take over the original Schnellbomber role by later in World War II, and function with a heavier bombload than the earlier Schnellbomber designs were capable of carrying, but due to the intractable development problems plaguing them, the continued unavailability of the needed pair of high power output engines of 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) and above each - primarily the complex, 24-cylinder multibank Junkers Jumo 222 - needed for such designs, no production aircraft were ever ordered under the Bomber B program. de Havilland Mosquito The most successful Schnellbomber of the war was the bomber version of the British de Havilland Mosquito. It retained a speed advantage over its enemies for much of the war, and was only able to be effectively countered by specialist versions of various night fighter designs, with the pioneering Me 262A jet fighter being a true potential threat in 1944. The Mosquito ended the war with the lowest loss rate among any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command. The Germans considered the Mosquito a superior implementation of their own Schnellbomber concept, and being a potential inspiration for the Focke-Wulf firm's own all- wood twin-engined, high-speed fighter design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 being given the name Moskito.

They currently play in the S√©rie C, the third tier of Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A1, the top tier of the S√£o Paulo state football league. Founded on May 24, 1947, Ituano won the S√£o Paulo State League twice. The club's home colours are red and black and the team mascot is a rooster. History The club was founded on May 24, 1947, by employees of Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana (Sorocabana Railroad), based in Itu. When founded the club was originally known as Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica Sorocabana. In the 1960s, the club changed its name to Ferrovi√°rio Atl√©tico Ituano and in the 1990s the club again changed its name, this time to Ituano Futebol Clube. In 1977 a group of sportsmen of Itu unified the football of the city around Ferrovi√°rio Atl√©tico Ituano (FAI) and reactivated the Liga Ituana de Futebol (Ituano Football League). In 1978 the club played in S√©rie A3 the third level of the S√£o Paulo state professional football championship. They were promoted to the Campeonato Paulista, the top-flight professional football league in S√£o Paulo in 1989 after clinching the S√©rie A2 championship. In 2002, Ituano became one of the few teams from outside the S√£o Paulo metroplex area to win the Campeonato Paulista. Juninho Paulista, a former player from the club's academy and former Brazilian international, became the club's president in 2010. Juninho joined in a player-president capacity helping the team avoid relegation on the final day of the 2010 season with the decisive goal in a 3‚Äì2 victory. In 2014, Ituano won the Campeonato Paulista, defeating the storied Santos Futebol Clube on penalty kicks. In 2019, Arsenal signed young winger Gabriel Martinelli from the club and he quickly became a first-team regular. Stadium Ituano's stadium is Est√°dio Novelli J√∫nior, inaugurated in 1947.

It was founded by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1873 as Penn College. In 1933, the name was changed to William Penn College, and finally to William Penn University in 2000. The university's athletic teams compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The university is a member of the Heart of America Athletic Conference. Before 2000, the school was a part of the NCAA Division III. History Penn College opened September 24, 1873. The college's name was changed from Penn College to William Penn College in 1933, sparking a controversy whether or not the institution had ceased to exist as an educational institution. That matter was settled once and for all by the Iowa Supreme Court which ruled that Penn College had not ceased to exist as an educational institution. In 2000, the name was changed again from William Penn College to William Penn University. In 1916, fire destroyed the original campus and Penn's business manager Robert Williams and freshman student Harry Oakley were killed when the four-ton college bell crashed through the main building and buried them beneath it. In 1995, William Penn's 'College for Working Adults' was founded, which enrolls non-traditional students in an evening program of accelerated study. In January 2000 the college returned to the NAIA Division II. William Penn is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and a member of the North Central Association. In 2007, Musco Lighting, also in Oskaloosa, donated $12 million to the school for various projects‚Äîthe biggest single gift in the school's history. The money was to be used for of new structures including student recreation, classrooms, laboratories, and a stand-alone Industrial Technology Center building called the Musco Technology Center (MTC), which is home for the expanding Digital Communication Program. =Historic district= Part of the campus has been set aside as a nationally recognized historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. At the time of its nomination it contained ten resources, which included one contributing site, four contributing buildings, two contributing structures, two non-contributing buildings, and one non-contributing structure. The focus of the district is the Quadrangle, which is the contributing site. Penn Hall (1917), Lewis Hall (1917), the Central Heating Plant (1917), and Spencer Memorial Chapel (1923) are the historic buildings. The historic structures are two Memorial Gates (c. 1918). The Southeast Memorial Gate is located at the intersection of North Market Street and Trueblood Avenue. The Southwest Memorial Gate is located at the entrance to a vehicular drive off of Trueblood Avenue. They were gifts of the classes of 1918‚Äì1920 to honor their classmates who died in World War I. Bloomington, Illinois architect A.T. Simmons designed the conceptual plan for the campus and the plans for individual buildings. He also designed the memorial gates; which were erected on May 20, 1918. The use of Prairie School architecture is an unusual choice for a collegiate setting, and it exemplifies how its influence grew beyond Illinois. The Spencer Memorial Chapel is an exception. It was designed by the prominent Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Bird and Rawson in the Colonial Revival style.

The Babylonian Chronicles (as published by Donald Wiseman in 1956) establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE.D. J. Wiseman, Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73. Before Wiseman's publication, E. R. Thiele had determined from the biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar's initial capture of Jerusalem occurred in the spring of 597 BCE,Edwin Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). , 9780825438257, 217. while other scholars, including William F.

Thiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which was used for most but not all of the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his first partial year; his first full year would be 597/596 BCE, and his eleventh year, the year Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BCE. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from Tishrei in autumn, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BCE.Leslie McFall, \\"A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\\" Bibliotheca Sacra 148 (1991) 45. Dating in traditional Jewish sources A variety of rabbinic sources state that the Second Temple stood for 420 years.Seder Olam Rabbah chapter 30; Tosefta Zevahim 13:6; Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 18a; Babylonian Talmud Megillah 11b-12a, Arakhin 12b The rabbis placed the destruction of the Second Temple in 68, 69, or 70 CEWhich Year Was the Second Temple Destroyed, 69 CE or 70 CE?Maimonides, R. Moses b. Maimon Responsa (vol. 2), ed. Jehoshua Blau, Rubin Mass Ltd. Publishers: Jerusalem 1989, responsum #389, which puts the destruction in Av of anno 379 of the Seleucid era, corresponding to 68 CE. implying that it was built in about 352 BCE. Adding 70 years between the destruction of the First Temple and the construction of the Second Temple, it follows that the First Temple was destroyed in around 422 BCE. This date is approximately 165 years later than the accepted year of 587 or 586 BCE. This discrepancy is referred to as the \\"missing years\\". =Details of rabbinic chronology= According to the TalmudAvodah Zarah 8b‚Äì9a and Seder Olam Rabbah,Chapter 30 the Second Temple stood for 420 years, with the years divided up as follows: :103 years (35 BCE‚Äì68 CE) = Herod's Dynasty. :103 years (138 BCE‚Äì35 BCE) = Hasmonean Dynasty. :180 years (318 BCE‚Äì138 BCE) = Grecian rule over Israel :34 years (352 BCE‚Äì318 BCE) = Persian rule while the Second Temple stood (not including additional years of Persian rule before the Temple's construction). The date of 318 BCE for the Greek conquest of Persia was later confirmed by Rabbeinu Chananel, who wroteIn his commentary on the Talmudic passage (Avodah Zarah 10a) that Alexander the Great rose to power six years before the beginning of the Seleucid era (which occurred in 312/11 BCE). Seventy years passed between the destruction of the First Temple and the building of the Second Temple in the seventy first year,II Chronicles 36:21 so construction of the Second Temple in 352 BCE implies that the First Temple was destroyed in 423 BCE. Similarly, Megillat Antiochus implies that the Second Temple was built in 352 BCE, and thus that the First Temple was destroyed in 423 BCE.See Megillat Antiochus#Chronology in Megillat Antiochus The figure of 420 years is derived from the prophecy of seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24‚Äì27, which the rabbis interpreted as referring to a period of 490 years which would pass between the destructions of the First and Second Temple - 70 years between the Temples, plus 420 years of the Second Temple, starting in the 71st year after the destruction.  Proposed explanations  If traditional dates are assumed to be based on the standard Hebrew calendar, then the differing traditional and modern academic dating of events cannot both be correct. Attempts to reconcile the two systems must show one or both to have errors. = Missing reign lengths in the Hebrew dating = Scholars see the discrepancy between the traditional and academic date of the destruction of the First Temple arising as a result of Jewish sages missing out the reign lengths of several Persian kings during the Persian Empire's rule over Israel. Modern scholars tally ten Persian kings whose combined reigns total 208 years. By contrast, ancient Jewish sages only mention four Persian kings totaling 52 years. The reigns of several Persian kings appear to be missing from the traditional calculations. = Missing years in Jewish tradition = Azariah dei RossiIn Me'or Einayim (c. 1573) was likely the first Jewish authority to claim that the traditional Hebrew dating is not historically precise regarding the years before the Second Temple. Nachman KrochmalIn Guide to the perplexed of our times (Hebrew, 1851) agrees with dei Rossi, pointing to the Greek name Antigonos mentioned in the beginning of Avot as proof that there must have been a longer period to account for this sign of Hellenic influence. He posits that certain books of the Bible such as Kohelet and Isaiah were written or redacted during this period. David Zvi Hoffmann points out that the Mishnah in Avot (1:4) in describing the chain of tradition uses the plural \\"accepted from them\\" even though the previous Mishnah only mentions one person. He posits that there must have been another Mishnah mentioning two sages that was later removed. The traditional account of Jewish history shows a discontinuity in the beginning of the 35th century: The account of Seder Olam Rabbah is complete only until this time. It has been postulated that this work was written to complement another historical work, about subsequent centuries until the time of Hadrian, which is no longer extant. It appears that Jewish dating systems only arose in the 35th century, so that precise historical records would naturally have existed only from that time onwards. The Minyan Shtarot system, used to date official Jewish documents, started in the year 3449. According to Moshe Lerman, the year-count \\"from Creation\\" was established around the same time (see Birkat Hachama for elaboration). It has also been posited that certain calculations in the Talmud compute better according to the academic dating. Two possible harmonizations are proposed by modern rabbis: * Shimon Schwab points to the words \\"seal the words and close the book\\" in the book of Daniel as a positive commandment to obscure the calculations for the Messiah mentioned within, so that the true date of the Messiah's arrival would not be known. However, Schwab later withdrew this suggestion for numerous reasons. * An alternative solution suggests that the sages were concerned with the acceptance of the Mishnah. There existed a rabbinical tradition that the year 4000 marked the close of the \\"era of Torah\\". The authors of the ·∏§akirah article propose that the sages therefore arranged the chronology so that the redaction of the Mishnah should coincide with that date and thus have a better chance of acceptance. = Critiques of academic dating = Attempts have been made to reinterpret the historical evidence to agree with the rabbinic tradition. The reinterpretation of the Greek, Babylonian and Persian sources that is required to support the traditional dating has been achieved only in parts and has not yet been achieved in its entirety. Similar problems face other attempts to revise dating (such as those of Peter James and David Rohl) and mainstream scholarship rejects such approaches. Where and how the Gregorian or Julian calendric differential gets factored in, remains another argument entirely. The Babylonian Chronicles are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the Third Book of Manetho.The Ancient Fragments, ed. I. P. Cory, Esq., p. 65, London 1828. Manetho was the high priest and scribe of Egypt who wrote down his history for Ptolemy Philadelphus.

A member of the Hutu ethnic group, Nkurunziza taught physical education before becoming involved in politics during the Burundian Civil War as part of the rebel National Council for the Defense of Democracy ‚Äì Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD‚ÄìFDD) of which he became leader in 2000. The CNDD‚ÄìFDD became a political party at the end of the Civil War and Nkurunziza was elected president. He held the post controversially for three terms, sparking significant public unrest in 2015. He announced his intention not to stand for re-election in 2020 and instead ceded power to √âvariste Ndayishimiye, whose candidacy he had endorsed. He died unexpectedly on 8 June 2020 shortly before the official end of his term. He was the longest-ruling president in Burundian history. Early life =Childhood and teaching career, 1964‚Äì1995= Pierre Nkurunziza was born on 18 December 1964 in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, shortly after the country's independence from Belgian rule in 1962. He was one of six children born into a family from Buye in Mwumba, Ngozi Province, where Nkurunziza spent his early years. His father, Eustache Ngabisha, was a politician from the Hutu ethnic group and a Catholic. Ngabisha was involved in the nationalist politics under the ruling Union for National Progress (Union pour le Progr√®s national, UPRONA) and was elected to the National Assembly in 1965. Ngabisha became a provincial governor but was killed in the genocidal violence of 1972. Nkurunziza's mother, Domitille Minani, was an assistant nurse from the Tutsi ethnic group who was Protestant. Nkurunziza himself was considered to be Hutu. Nkurunziza attended school in Ngozi and studied at the prestigious ath√©n√©e in Gitega after his father's death. He enrolled at the Institute of Physical Education and Sports at the University of Burundi and obtained a degree in physical education in 1990. He taught at a school in Muramvya before becoming an assistant lecturer at the University in 1992. He was a football coach for Muzinga FC and Union Sporting in the country's first division. However, he was not known to be politically active. He also taught at the Higher Institute for Military Cadres (Institut sup√©rieur des cadres militaires, ISCAM) where he made important personal contacts with future leading rebels. He married Denise Bucumi in 1994. =Burundian Civil War and CNDD‚ÄìFDD, 1995‚Äì2005= Nkurunziza studied and later taught physical education at the University of Burundi (pictured) but was forced to flee in 1995 during the Burundian Civil War The newly elected president Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated in an attempted coup d'√©tat in October 1993. The killing sparked a wave of ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions and the start of the Burundian Civil War. Nkurunziza was still teaching at the University of Burundi but was forced to flee in 1995 after hundreds of Hutu students were killed. He spent several years in hiding in the bush and was himself was sentenced to death in absentia by a government-backed court in 1998 for planting land mines. At the time, he became associated with the moderate rebel group National Council for the Defense of Democracy ‚Äì Forces for the Defense of Democracy (Conseil National Pour la D√©fense de la D√©mocratie ‚Äì Forces pour la D√©fense de la D√©mocratie, CNDD‚ÄìFDD), largely supported by ethnic Hutus. By 1998, he had risen to the position of General Secretary of the CNDD‚ÄìFDD and was in charge of coordinating the political and military wings. He fought for their militia and gained the nickname \\"Pita\\". He was nearly killed near Gitega in 2001 but interpreted his survival as a sign that he was destined to lead the group. Nkurunziza himself became a born-again Protestant and supported the integration of Tutsis and other minority groups into the CNDD‚ÄìFDD. All five of Nkurunziza's siblings were killed in the Civil War, three of whom while fighting for the CNDD‚ÄìFDD. Nkurunziza became the president of the CNDD‚ÄìFDD on 28 August 2000 and presided over the movement as it moved towards a political compromise with the government. A series of agreements in 2003 paved the way for the CNDD‚ÄìFDD to enter national politics, and allowed Nkurunziza to be reunited with his wife and surviving family members. He became Minister for Good Government and the General Inspection of the State in the transitional government of Domitien Ndayizeye which was considered \\"a springboard post at a moment when electoral preparations were under way to complete the transition\\". He was re-elected president of the CNDD‚ÄìFDD, now a political party, in August 2004, and became its candidate for the forthcoming legislative and presidential elections. The elections brought Nkurunziza and the CNDD‚ÄìFDD to power with a large majority of the vote. He succeeded Ndayizeye as the President of Burundi. Presidency =First term, 2005‚Äì2010= Nkurunziza's term as president began on 26 August 2005 and he soon adopted a number of popular policies. He presided over the reconstruction of the Burundian state on the basis of the inter-ethnic compromise enshrined in the Arusha Accords which mandated the partition of state positions between Tutsi, Hutu, and the minority Twa ethnic groups. The Party for the Liberation of the Hutu PeopleNational Forces of Liberation (Parti pour la lib√©ration du peuple HutuForces nationales de lib√©ration, PALIPEHUTU‚ÄìFNL), the final Hutu rebel faction in the Civil War, was demobilised in 2008. Burundi became actively involved in the African Union and the state's outstanding public debt was cancelled in 2009 by the \\"Paris Club\\". However, Nkurunziza's reputation became increasingly tarnished in the face of political factionalism, corruption, and continued insecurity. Hussein Radjabu, a leading figure in the CNDD‚ÄìFDD, was imprisoned for insulting Nkurunziza in 2008. However, Nkurunziza was re- elected for a second term in July 2010 with a big majority but was effectively unopposed, as the polls were boycotted by opposition parties. =Second term and unrest, 2010‚Äì2015= Burundian police clash with protesters opposed to Nkurunziza's third term in April 2015. 1,700 civilians were estimated to have been killed in the subsequent repression and 350,000 fled into exile. Nkurunziza's second term saw rising discontent with his leadership. Outdoor jogging was banned in June 2014 out of fear that group exercise might be used as cover for political meetings. Dissent came to a head with the public announcement on 25 April 2015 that Nkurunziza would stand for a third term in the presidential elections scheduled for June that year. This appeared to be contrary to the term limits established in the Arusha Accords and sparked widespread protests in Bujumbura and elsewhere which led to violent confrontations. However, the Constitutional Court ruled on 5 May that the projected third term was legal. The protests then escalated and dozens were killed. A military uprising was attempted on 13 May 2015 by soldiers loyal to Godefroid Niyombare but collapsed after extensive fighting in Bujumbura. Assassinations of opposition politicians and critics took place and it was reported that detained protesters were tortured or raped at so-called \\"black sites\\" by regime loyalists. However, the following months also saw the assassination of a number of CNDD‚ÄìFDD officials and loyalists including Adolphe Nshimirimana. A rebel group emerged as the Republican Forces of Burundi (Forces r√©publicaines du Burundi, FOREBU) and large numbers of civilians fled into exile. Despite the instability and a continuing opposition boycott, the elections took place in July and Nkurunziza was re-elected for a third term. =Third term and resignation, 2015‚Äì2020= Nkurunziza's third term saw the country's increasing isolation in light of international condemnation of the repression which accompanied the 2015 unrest. The East African Community and African Union attempted to mediate the conflict unsuccessfully and Nkurunziza's regime became increasingly isolated. Fearing an outbreak of genocidal violence, the African Union attempted to despatch a peacekeeping force to Burundi in 2016 but this was blocked by Nkurunziza. 1,700 civilians were estimated to have been killed in the subsequent repression and 390,000 fled across the border into Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Poverty increased and many middle-class Burundians emigrated. Nkurunziza withdrew Burundi from the International Criminal Court in 2017 and advocated constitutional reforms which would allow longer presidential terms which were approved in a disputed referendum in May 2018. However, in June 2018 he announced that he would not be standing for a fourth term and that he would consequently step down in 2020. The same year, he was given the title of \\"Permanent Visionary\\" by the CNDD‚ÄìFDD. The CNDD‚ÄìFDD's presidential candidate for the elections of 2020 was √âvariste Ndayishimiye, whom Nkurunziza specifically endorsed. The elections took place in May 2020 and resulted in a large majority in favour of Nkurunziza's candidate. However, the elections occurred against the backdrop of criticism of Nkurunziza's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Burundi during which representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) were expelled. Election monitors from the East African Community were also kept out. Death Nkurunziza died unexpectedly on 8 June 2020, aged 55, at the Fiftieth Anniversary Hospital in Karuzi. The Burundian government gave his cause of death as a heart attack, but it was widely suspected that he died of COVID-19. A week earlier, The Standard reported his wife had flown without him to Nairobi, Kenya, for COVID-19 treatment. Nkurunziza's death occurred after the 2020 elections, but ahead of the projected hand-over of power in August. It had been announced in May 2020 that he would continue to remain prominent in public life in the post of \\"Supreme Guide of Patriotism\\" with a retirement award of $540,000 (USD) and a villa provided by the Burundian state. Seven national days of mourning were announced following his death.

Critics and fellow writers praised the book on its release. Due to its frank portrayals of taboo subjects, such as drug use, street violence, gang rape, homosexuality, transvestism and domestic violence it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the United Kingdom and was banned in Italy. Synopsis The stories are set almost entirely in what is now considered the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn; the location is widely misreported as Red Hook, where one story is set and parts of the 1989 movie were filmed.\\"Fifty Years Later, Looking for Last Exit: Chasing Hubert Selby‚Äôs ghost through the neighborhood he captured in his controversial classic.\\" by Henry Stewart. BKLYNR Issue 36  October 10, 2014 Last Exit to Brooklyn is divided into six parts that can, more or less, be read separately. Each part is prefaced with a passage from the Bible. * Another Day, Another Dollar: A gang of young Brooklyn hoodlums hang around an all-night cafe and get into a vicious fight with a group of US Army soldiers on leave. *The Queen Is Dead: Georgette, a sassy transgender hooker, is thrown out of the family home by her brother and tries to attract the attention of a hoodlum named Vinnie at a benzedrine-driven party. *And Baby Makes Three: The story told by an unknown narrator about a couple, Suzy and Tommy, and their wedding, and baby's christening party thrown by Suzy's parents. *Tralala: The title character of an earlier Selby short story, she is a young Brooklyn prostitute who makes a living propositioning sailors in bars and stealing their money. In perhaps the novel's most notorious scene, she is brutally gang-raped after a night of heavy drinking. *Strike: Harry, a machinist in a factory, becomes a local official in the union. He is a closeted gay man, he abuses his wife, tries to boast his accomplishments and his high status to anyone who might listen to convince himself that he is a man. He gains a temporary status and importance during a long strike, and uses the union's money to entertain the young street punks and buy the company of drag queens and gay men. *Landsend: Described as a \\"coda\\" for the book, this section presents the intertwined, yet ordinary day of numerous denizens in a housing project. Style Last Exit to Brooklyn was written in an idiosyncratic style that ignores most conventions of grammar. Selby wrote most of the prose as if it were a story told from one friend to another at a bar rather than a novel, using coarse and casual language. He used slang-like conjunctions of words, such as tahell for \\"to hell\\" and yago for \\"you go.\\" The paragraphs were often written in a stream of consciousness style with many parentheses and fragments. Selby often indented new paragraphs to the middle or end of the line. Also, Selby did not use quotation marks to distinguish dialogue but instead merely blended it into the text. He used a slash instead of an apostrophe mark for contractions and did not use an apostrophe at all for possessives. Publication history Last Exit to Brooklyn started as The Queen is Dead, one of several short stories Selby wrote about people he had met around Brooklyn while working as a copywriter and general laborer. The piece was published in three literary magazines in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Tralala first appeared in The Provincetown Review in 1961, drawing criticism which resulted in an obscenity trial. The pieces later evolved into the full-length book, which was published in 1964 by Grove Press, which had previously published such controversial authors as William S. Burroughs and Henry Miller. Critics praised and censured the publication. Poet Allen Ginsberg said that it will \\"explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America and still be eagerly read in a hundred years.\\" Trial The rights for the British edition were acquired by Marion Boyars and John Calder and the novel ended up in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The manuscript was published in January 1966, received positive reviews and sold almost 14,000 copies. The director of Blackwell's bookshop in Oxford complained to the DPP about the detailed depictions of brutality and cruelty in the book but the DPP did not pursue the allegations. Sir Cyril Black, the then Conservative Member of Parliament for Wimbledon, initiated a private prosecution of the novel before Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court, under judge Leo Gradwell. The public prosecutor brought an action under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act. During the hearing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate ordered that all copies of the book within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court to be seized. Not a single bookseller possessed a copy, but the publishing offices of Calder and Boyars, within the Bow Street Magistrate's jurisdiction, were discovered to be in possession of three copies. The books were duly seized, and Mrs. Boyars was summonsed to show cause why \\"the said articles\\" should not be forfeited.Forell, Claude. \\"A Noble Crusader for Purity.\\" The Age Literary Review, March 25, 1967.

At the hearing Calder declared that the book would continue to be published and would be sold everywhere else outside of that jurisdiction. In response the prosecutor brought criminal charges under Section 2 of the Act, which entitled the defendants to trial by jury under Section 4. The jury was all male. Judge Graham Rigers directed that the women \\"might be embarrassed at having to read a book which dealt with homosexuality, prostitution, drug-taking and sexual perversion.\\"\\"Obituaries: Hubert Selby, Jr.\\", The Times, April 28, 2004. The trial lasted nine days; on November 23 the jury returned a guilty verdict. In 1968, an appeal issued by the lawyer and writer John Mortimer resulted in a judgment by Mr Justice Lane which reversed the ruling. The case marked a turning point in British censorship laws. By that time, the novel had sold over 33,000 hardback and 500,000 paperback copies in the United States. Film adaptation In 1989, director Uli Edel helmed a film adaptation of the novel.

It is known only from a single skull discovered in Wyoming. Its status is the subject of ongoing debate among paleontologists: some authors consider Nedoceratops a valid, distinct taxon, while others consider it to represent an ontogenetic (growth) stage of Triceratops and thus a synonym. History of discovery Skull exhibited at the Smithsonian The paper that described Nedoceratops was originally part of O. C. Marsh's magnum opus, his Ceratopsidae monograph. Unfortunately, Marsh died (1899) before the work was completed, and John Bell Hatcher endeavored to complete the Triceratops section. However, he died of typhus in 1904 at the age of 42, leaving the paper still incomplete. It fell to Richard Swann Lull to complete the monograph in 1905, publishing Hatcher's description of a skull separately and giving it the name Diceratops hatcheri; Diceratops means \\"two horned face.\\" Since the Diceratops paper had been written by Hatcher, and Lull had only contributed the name and published the paper after Hatcher's death, Lull was not quite as convinced of the distinctiveness of Diceratops, thinking it primarily pathological. By 1933, Lull had had second thoughts about Diceratops being a distinct genus and he put it in a subgenus of Triceratops: Triceratops (Diceratops) hatcheri, including T. obtusus; largely attributing its differences to being that of an aged individual. Because the Diceratops name was already in use for a hymenopteran (Foerster, 1868), Andrey Sergeevich Ukrainsky gave the animal its current name Nedoceratops in 2007.Ukrainsky, A.S. (2007). \\"A new replacement name for Diceratops Lull, 1905 (Reptilia: Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae).\\" Zoosystematica Rossica, 16(2), 20 December 2007: 292. Unaware that Ukrainsky had already renamed the animal, Oct√°vio Mateus coined another new name for it in 2008, Diceratus.Ukrainsky, A.S. (2009). \\"Sinonimiya rodov Nedoceratops Ukrainsky, 2007 i Diceratus Mateus, 2008 (Reptilia: Ornithischia: Ceratopidae).\\" Paleontologicheskii zhurnal, 2009(1): 108. Translated as: Ukrainsky, A.S.

Diceratus is thus considered a junior synonym of Nedoceratops. Nedoceratops means \\"insufficient horned face\\". The \\"nedo\\" is the Russian prefix meaning \\"insufficient\\". The suffix common among ceratopsians, \\"ceratops\\", means \\"horned face\\". It was named in reference to its lack of a nasal horn. Description Restoration The nearly complete skull known as \\"USNM 2412\\" is the only fossil of Nedoceratops. Like Hatcher's other Triceratops skulls, it was found in eastern Wyoming, i.c. in 1891 in Niobrara County near Lightning Creek. Superficially, it resembles that of Triceratops, but on closer examination, it differs: there is just a rounded stump where the nasal horn should be and the occipital (brow) horns stand almost vertically. Compared to other Triceratops skulls, it is slightly larger than average (1.8m in longest length), but its face is rather short. There also are large holes in the frill, unlike other Triceratops skulls known. Some of these may be pathological, others seem to be genetic. Lull suggested that the holes in the frill were the result of \\"accidental gorings\\" from another dinosaur. However, this issue is still up for debate. The following traits of USNM 2412 have been tentatively proposed by Andrew Farke as distinguishing Nedoceratops from Triceratops: It lacks a recognizable nasal horn. It has almost vertical postorbital horncores. It has small parietal fenestrae (lacking in Triceratops). Classification Skull comparisons of Triceratops and Nedoceratops The type species is Nedoceratops hatcheri. Nedoceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is Greek for \\"horned faces\\", ŒöŒµœÅŒ±œÑœåœàŒπŒ±), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. All ceratopsians became extinct at the end of this era. Several authors have suggested that Nedoceratops may be directly ancestral to Triceratops, or perhaps its nearest relative. An ongoing debate concerns the status of Triceratops, Torosaurus, and Nedoceratops. In a series of publications, John B. Scannella and John R. Horner (2010 and 2011) and claimed that the USNM 2412 skull (i.e., of Nedoceratops) belonged to a \\"young adult\\" Triceratops. Evidence for this hypothesis included the shapes of the epoccipital and squamosal bones, and a neck frill (parietal bone) that had \\"incipient\\" openings (contrasting with no openings in subadult Triceratops and large openings in adult Triceratops formerly assigned to Torosaurus). The authors were of the opinion that the nasal horn of the USNM 2412 skull could have been lost when the animal was alive or when it became fossilized., and that all three \\"genera\\" actually represent different aged individuals of Triceratops. In 2012, Farke proposed a counter argument, and suggested that the bone surface texture and shape of the horns of Nedoceratops indicate an \\"old adult\\". A follow-up study by Leonardo Maiorino and colleagues in 2013 using morphometrics found support for Triceratops and Torosaurus being distinct, valid taxa, with Nedoceratops occupying variable positions with respect to the other two but generally outside the range of variation, concluding that \\"the size of USNM 2412 is a plausible intermediate, but the shape is not.\\" However, it has also been noted that many of the features that separate Nedoceratops from Triceratops, and specifically Triceratops horridus, may be the result of pathology and/or deformation of the skull after burial. Two of the features that have been used to diagnose Nedoceratops- the position of the squamosal, and the upright brow horns- are seen on one side of the skull, but not the other. This- along with the fact that the entire skull can be seen to be twisted when seen head-on- had been used to argue that these features result from post-mortem distortion of the fossil, rather than reflecting the anatomy of the animal during life. Furthermore, the presence of numerous holes in the frill suggests pathology due to injury or illness, the 'parietal fenestrae' may therefore be an artifact. Unfortunately, the frill is only preserved on one side, which makes it difficult to test this hypothesis. The one unquestionable difference between Nedoceratops and fossils referred to Triceratops horridus is the remarkably short nasal horn, although the horns of ceratopsids show marked intraspecific and ontogenetic variation. In most features- the short, saddle-shape frill, the s-shaped snout- the animal closely resembles Triceratops horridus.

She is married to the god Sugaar (also known as Sugoi or Maju). Legends connect her to the weather: when she and Maju travel together hail will fall, her departures from her cave will be accompanied by storms or droughts, and which cave she lives in at different times will determine dry or wet weather: wet when she is in Anboto; dry when she is elsewhere (the details vary). Other places where she is said to dwell include the chasm of Murumendi, the cave of Gurutzegorri (Ataun), Aizkorri and Aralar, although it is not always possible to be certain which Basque legends should be considered as the origin.  Etymology  It is believed that Mari is a modification of Emari (gift) or Amari (mother + the suffix of profession) by losing the first vowel. The closeness in names between Mary and Mari may have helped pagans adapt their worship of Mari to undertake Christian veneration of the Virgin Mary.This derives from articles in the Enciclopedia General Ilustrada del Pais Vasco Encyclopedia Au√±amendi, which in turn cite Euskalerriaren Yakintza, Tomo I \\"Costumbres y supersticiones\\", by folklorist Resurrecci√≥n Mar√≠a de Azkue (1864-1951). It notes that additional legends were recorded by Jose Miguel Barandiaran and Juan Thalamas Labandibar. The first known written citation of the \\"Dame of Amboto\\" was made by Charles V's chronicler Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa in his Memorial hist√≥rico espa√±ol.Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa, Memorial hist√≥rico espa√±ol: colecci√≥n de documentos, op√∫sculos y antig√ºedades, Tomo VII. Beliefs associated with Mari Anboto is one of the mountains where Mari is supposed to live Mari lives underground, normally in a cave in a high mountain, where she and her consort Sugaar meet every Friday (the night of the Akelarre or witch-meeting) to conceive the storms that will bring fertility (and sometimes disgrace) to the land and the people. Mari is served by a court of sorginak (witches), and is said to feed \\"on the negation and affirmation\\" (that is, on falsehood). Occasionally the figure of Mari is linked to the kidnapping or theft of cows. The presence of Christian priests in those myths may indicate that they are Christian fabrications or distortions of original material. Legends do not recount any kind of sacrifices offered to Mari under normal circumstances, in contrast to food given to lesser spirits (lamiak, jentilak, etc.), as recompense for their work in the fields. In various legends, Mari is said to have sons or daughters, but their number and character fluctuate. The two most well-known were her two sons, Atxular and Mikelatz. Atxular represents largely the Christianized Basque soul, becoming a priest after having learned from the Devil in a church in Salamanca and then having escaped. Mikelatz seems to have a more negative or wild character ; he is sometimes assimilated into the spirit of storms, Hodei, or embodied as a young red bull. Another legend presents Mari as wife to the Lord of Biscay, Diego L√≥pez I de Haro. This marriage may symbolize the legitimacy of the dynasty, much in the style of the Irish goddess marrying the kings of that island as a religious act of legitimacy. In any case, the condition that Mari imposes on her husband is that, while he could keep his Christian faith, he was obliged to keep it outside the home. Once, apparently after discovering that his wife had a goat leg instead of a normal human foot, he made the sign of the cross. Immediately after that act, Mari took her daughter, jumped through the window and disappeared, never to return. This account can be heard as delegitimizing the de Haro family, who had been placed as lords by the Castilian conquerors not long before this myth arose. Other legends are more simple. For example, there is a legend that when one is lost in the wild, one only has to cry Mari's name loudly three times to have her appear over one's head to help the person find his or her way. The people of O√±ati believed that the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, and dry when she was in Alo√±a. In Zeanuri, Biscay, they say that she would stay seven years in Anboto, then the next seven in a cave in Oiz called Supelegor. A similar legend in Olaeta, Biscay substitutes Gorbea for Supelegor. A legend from Otxandio, Biscay tells that Mari was born in Lazkao, Gipuzkoa, and that she was the evil sister of a Roman Catholic priest. In other legends, the priest is her cousin Juanito Chistu, rather than a brother, and is a great hunter. She was said to take a distaff by the middle and walk along spinning, and leaving storms in her wake. In Elorrieta, Biscay, it was said that she would be in her cave, combing her hair, and not even a shepherd could draw near to her. It was also said that her malign power did not extend to those who were innocent of sin. Folklorist Resurrecci√≥n Mar√≠a de Azkue ties Mari Urraca to a legend about a princess of the Kingdom of Navarre, widow of a 12th-century nobleman who lived in the Tower of Muncharaz in the valley known as the Merindad de Durango. She vanished at the time of his death and was said to have headed for the cave of Anboto. According to Azkue, Iturriza tells this story in his Historia de Vizcaya. Labayru in her Historia de Vizcaya doubts it. Legends attached to the Lady of Murumendi, according to Azkue, include that she had seven brothers and was changed into a witch for her disobedience, and that the weather would be warm (or turbulent) when she walked about. In Beizama, Gipuzkoa, they say that if she stays in her cave and if, on the day of the Holy Cross, appropriate spells are cast, hail can be prevented. They also say that she and her husband once went to church in a cart and that upon leaving church, she rose into the air saying, \\"Domingo, Domingo el de Murua, siete hijos para el mundo, ninguno para el cielo\\" (\\"Domingo, Domingo of Murua, seven children for the world, none for heaven\\").The meaning of \\"Murua\\" is obscure, but it might perhaps refer to the small village of near Beizama. It may be impossible to be certain. Mari was associated with various forces of nature, including thunder and wind. As the personification of the Earth, she may have been worshipped in association with Lurbira. Mari was regarded as the protectoress of senators and the executive branch. She is depicted as riding through the sky in a chariot pulled by horses or rams. Her idols usually feature a full moon behind her head. Mari is the main character of Basque mythology, having, unlike other creatures that share the same spiritual environment, a god-like nature. Mari is often witnessed as a woman dressed in red. She is also seen as a woman of fire, woman-tree and as thunderbolt. Additionally, she is identified with red animals (cow, ram, horse), and with the black he-goat. Christianization Santa Marina, a saint revered in the Basque Country, is a Christianized version of Mari. Basque women still invoke Santa Marina's protection against curses and for aid in childbirth. The most accepted syncretism is with the Virgin Mary; she is widely venerated by modern Christian Basques.

Political cartoon, 1920. The Irreconcilables were bitter opponents of the Treaty of Versailles in the United States in 1919. Specifically, the term refers to about 12 to 18 United States Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, who fought intensely to defeat the ratification of the treaty by the Senate in 1919. They succeeded, and the United States never ratified the Treaty of Versailles and never joined the League of Nations. History The Republican Party controlled the United States Senate after the election of 1918, but the Senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.Thomas A. Bailey, Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal (1945) One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed President Woodrow Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest block, led by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge,William C. Widenor, Henry Cabot Lodge and the Search for an American Foreign Policy (1980) comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article 10, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress.Stone (1970) The closest the Treaty came to passage, came in mid-November 1919, was when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification. Among the leading Irreconcilables were Republicans George W. Norris of Nebraska, William Borah of Idaho, Robert La Follette of Wisconsin, and Hiram Johnson of California. Democrats included Senators Thomas Gore of Oklahoma, James Reed of Missouri, and the Irish Catholic leader David I. Walsh of Massachusetts.Bailey, (1945) p. 53. The lists vary, but Ralph Stone identified 16 in 1963: Borah, Frank B. Brandegee of Connecticut, Albert B. Fall of New Mexico, Bert M. Fernald of Maine, Joseph I. France of Maryland, Asle J. Gronna of North Dakota, Johnson, Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania, La Follette, Medill McCormick of Illinois, George H. Moses of New Hampshire, Norris, Miles Poindexter of Washington, Reed, Lawrence Sherman of Illinois, and Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Reed and Thomas were Democrats, the other 14 were Republicans McCormick's position can be traced to his Anglophobia and nationalistic attitudes, Sherman's to personal antipathy to President Woodrow Wilson and his domestic policies.Stone 1963 Indeed, all of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them. However, Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.John Milton Cooper, Jr. Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2009) ch 22 According to Stone's 1970 book, the Irreconcilables in the Senate fell into three loosely defined factions. One group was composed of isolationists and nationalists who proclaimed that America must be the sole commander of its destiny, and that membership in any international organization that might have power over the United States was unacceptable. A second group, the \\"realists\\", rejected isolationism in favor of limited cooperation among nations with similar interests. They thought the League of Nations would be too strong. A third group, the \\"idealists\\", called for a League with far reaching authority. The three factions cooperated to help defeat the treaty. All of them denounced the League as a tool of Britain and its nefarious empire. Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the Treaty.Duff (1968) See also * Treaty of Versailles * Henry Cabot Lodge * Woodrow Wilson Notes  Further reading * Bailey, Thomas A.

Childs; and commissioned 22 October 1920, Commander I. H. Mayfield in command. Arriving at Gibraltar 14 February 1921, Childs joined U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, to cruise in the Mediterranean, Adriatic, North, and Baltic Seas until 25 November, when she arrived at Constantinople. Here she joined the relief mission sent to Russia early in 1922, remaining in the Black Sea on diplomatic duties until 1 April.

She spent the summer of 1935 cruising off the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The next year Childs returned to the east coast for overhaul, then returned to duty at San Diego, cruising several times to the Hawaiian Islands before 14 May 1938, when she cleared for Philadelphia and conversion to a seaplane tender. Reclassified AVP-14, she saw her first service in her new role during the annual fleet problem of 1939, operating between the Florida coast and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and after final preparations at Philadelphia, sailed for her new base at Pearl Harbor, arriving 29 June. She tended seaplanes there and on the plane guard stations off Midway, Wake Island, and Guam until 1 October 1940, when she was reclassified AVD-1, and ordered to the Asiatic Station.

When war with Japan broke out, Childs lay in Cavite Navy Yard for repair, and during the devastation of the yard by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941, escaped damage by evasive maneuvering in the confined harbor area. She tended her flying boats of Patrol Wing 10 from Manila for 4 more days, then began a lengthy base-to-base withdrawal. On leaving Kendari harbour on 24 January 1942 she evaded the invading Japanese fleet in a rain squall and survived an air attack. At Surabaya the tenders Childs, Heron, and Preston rotated as needed to service VP101 which was patrolling Makassar Strait. Finally she reached Exmouth Gulf, Australia, 28 February 1942. From Fremantle and other Western Australia ports, Childs continued her tender duties until 12 August 1944. During this time, her planes scouted and bombed Japanese positions and shipping, mined the waters off Balikpapan, Borneo, and performed air-sea rescue missions.

It was created by Gerard Alessandrini, who also created the ever-popular series of Off-Broadway parodies of Broadway theatre, Forbidden Broadway.

He is typically portrayed as a wealthy and greedy clergyman who is robbed by Robin and his Merry Men. History The character first appears by this name in the ballad \\"Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford\\". The earliest surviving text is in the Forresters manuscript (British Library Additional MS 71158), which dates to the 1670s.Knight, pp. xi‚Äìxii Relying on later printed versions, Francis James Child collected the work as Child Ballad 144.Child, p. 340. In the song, Robin Hood and some of his men, disguised as shepherds, poach a deer in an area where they know the Bishop of Hereford will pass through. Finding them, the Bishop threatens to bring them before King Richard, and refuses to grant them pardon. Robin summons his Merry Men, who capture the Bishop and force him to \\"pay for\\" a feast with the outlaws and to sing a mass for them.Knight, pp. 38‚àí43 and notes.Child, pp. 340‚Äì341. Child regarded it as \\"far superior to most of the seventeenth-century broadsides\\". The work is related to Child Ballad 143, \\"Robin Hood and the Bishop\\", which features an unidentified bishop and ends in a nearly identical way. Both are variants of the episode in the much older \\"Gest of Robyn Hode\\" in which Robin robs a monk.Child, p. 338. The Bishop of Hereford appears in the subsequent Child Ballad, \\"Robin Hood and Queen Katherine\\", in which he refers to the action in the previous work and refuses to bet on Robin in an archery contest.Child, pp. 341‚Äì346. Scholar Stephen Knight notes that there are multiple historical Bishops of Hereford who have been suggested as a model for the character in the ballads. He may have been based on Adam Orleton, Bishop from 1317 to 1327, an antagonist of Edward II of England who became very unpopular during the reign of Edward III. He was a well-known figure at the time the earliest Robin Hood ballads likely developed in the 14th century. Another suggestion is the famously corrupt Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford from 1240 to 1268. However, he would have been much less well known in the 14th century. As the ballad identifies the sitting king as Richard, the contemporary bishop William de Vere has also been suggested, but Knight regards this as unlikely.Knight, p. 144. The Bishop of Hereford appears in Howard Pyle's influential children's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (1883), based on the medieval ballads. The Merry Men rob him to pay Sir Richard at the Lee's debt. Later, he is scheduled to perform the marriage of Alan-a-Dale's sweetheart to her unwanted wooer, until Robin intervenes. He also appears in the archery contest scene, where the Queen (here Eleanor of Aquitaine) attributes his refusal to bet on Robin more to greed than to the impropriety of his betting. The Hereford Bishop appears in the anime series Robin Hood no Daib≈çken voiced by Yuu Shimaka, and is portrayed as a greedy bishop of Nottingham and ally to Baron Alwyn (the main antagonist) who desires Marian Lancaster for the Lancaster's wealth; however, he later betrays the Baron near the end and join with Robin and his friends to overthrow his unstable leader. The role of the Bishop of Hereford was played by Harold Innocent in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. In this version, he is depicted as a corrupt clergyman who supports the Sheriff and insists to Robin that the latter's father admitted to being a devil-worshiper. This culminates in Friar Tuck, disgusted and enraged at the Bishop's corruption and hypocrisy, shoving him out of a window to his death.

She was operated by the French Line, Costa Cruises, and the Epirotiki Line. History =French Line= Flandre at sea. Flandre was the French Line's first new ocean liner following World War II. Her maiden voyage was considered a complete disaster, as she experienced mechanical difficulties throughout the voyage. The first sign of trouble was when her fuel line filters became clogged with impurities in the oil that she was carrying. This caused her to become essentially \\"dead in the water\\" for four hours while her fuel filters were cleaned out and her boilers restored to normal operation. This was repeated later in the voyage, after which Flandre's captain elected to reduce speed for the remainder of the voyage. Upon arrival at the Quarantine Station at New York, she experienced a short circuit in her main electrical switchboard causing a near-complete loss of power. Nearly three hours later, she had sufficient power restored to raise the port anchor. An additional three hours were required to raise the starboard anchor to allow her to continue. Unlike most ocean liners' maiden arrivals, where they receive the traditional fireboat welcome while sailing under their own power, Flandre arrived in New York Harbor and received the traditional welcome while under tow by four Moran tugs, while also running one propeller of her own. Her funnel put out thick clouds of smoke, seeming to almost be straining as it was doing so. She was initially blowing her whistle as she arrived under tow, but after the whistle failed due to her limited power, the ship's siren was substituted. This lacklustre arrival garnered her the nickname \\"Flounder\\" by Manhattan dockers.William H. Miller Jr. - \\"Picture History of the French Line\\" Flandre's return voyage was delayed to allow engineers to repair her engines. Following her return to France, all of her 1952 sailings were cancelled, and she returned to her builders for thorough repairs. Repairs would take six months, and she returned for the 1953 sailing season. During her French Line career, her passenger configuration changed several times, with Flandre running on the transatlantic route for nine months out of the year, and three months cruising with her near-sister . In 1967, she was withdrawn completely, and was sold to the Italian firm Costa Cruises, who renamed her Carla C. =Costa Cruises= The first assignment for the newly refitted Carla C was a charter for Princess Cruises, which marketed her as \\"Princess Carla\\" (the ship was not renamed). It was during this time that a set of producers originated the idea of the popular television-series The Love Boat aboard Carla C. Consequently, the first scripts were written on board the ship. The ship proved problematic at first, after problems were detected with the boilers. In 1974 and 1975, Costa replaced the boilers with Stork-Werkspor diesel engines and Carla C was returned to service around the Caribbean, where she served until 1992. In 1984, the ship underwent another major refit, to ensure safe travel for its passengers for many years to come. In 1986, Carla C was renamed Carla Costa. No other changes occurred with the name change. Carla Costa was a common sight on the San Juan ship dock on Saturdays during that era, and her regularly scheduled route included Cura√ßao, Caracas, Grenada, Martinique, and St. Thomas USVI. =Epirotiki Line= Pallas Athena laid up in Perama Bay in 1994 after its fire. In 1992, Carla Costa was sold to the Greek Epirotiki Line, and renamed Pallas Athena, after the Greek goddess Pallas Athene. For the Epirotiki Line, she ran seven-day cruises from Athens to the Aegean Islands and Turkey. On 23 March 1994, Pallas Athena was destroyed by fire, which caused the superstructure and funnel to cave in on themselves. She arrived at the Aliaga Company scrapyards on 25 December 1994, one of only two surviving French Line ocean liners. =In popular culture= Flandre or Antilles appeared as stock footage in the 1964 Perry Mason episode Nautical Knot, set near Acapulco, Mexico. The scenes on board were filmed on a studio set. P&O; Line's equally popular also appears in the episode.

It had four to six long parietal spikes extending from its neck frill, a smaller jugal horn on each of its cheeks, and a single horn protruding from its nose, which may have been up to long and wide. The function or functions of the horns and frills have been debated for many years. Styracosaurus was a relatively large dinosaur, reaching lengths of and weighing nearly 3 tonnes. It stood about tall. Styracosaurus possessed four short legs and a bulky body. Its tail was rather short. The skull had a beak and shearing cheek teeth arranged in continuous dental batteries, suggesting that the animal sliced up plants. Like other ceratopsians, this dinosaur may have been a herd animal, travelling in large groups, as suggested by bonebeds. Named by Lawrence Lambe in 1913, Styracosaurus is a member of the Centrosaurinae. One species, S. albertensis, is currently assigned to Styracosaurus. Another species, S. ovatus, named in 1930 by Charles Gilmore was reassigned to a new genus, Rubeosaurus, by Andrew McDonald and Jack Horner in 2010.Andrew T. McDonald & John R. Horner, (2010). \\"New Material of \\"Styracosaurus\\" ovatus from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana\\". Pages 156‚Äì168 in: Michael J. Ryan, Brenda J. Chinnery-Allgeier, and David A. Eberth (eds), New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs: The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, IN. Discoveries and species Excavation of the holotype specimen The first fossil remains of Styracosaurus were collected in Alberta, Canada by C.M. Sternberg (from an area now known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, in a formation now called the Dinosaur Park Formation) and named by Lawrence Lambe in 1913. This quarry was revisited in 1935 by a Royal Ontario Museum crew who found the missing lower jaws and most of the skeleton. These fossils indicate that S. albertensis was around 5.5 to 5.8 meters in length and stood about 1.65 meters high at the hips. An unusual feature of this first skull is that the smallest frill spike on the left side is partially overlapped at its base by the next spike. It appears that the frill suffered a break at this point in life and was shortened by about . The normal shape of this area is unknown because the corresponding area of the right side of the frill was not recovered. Styracosaurus \\"parksi\\" skeleton, specimen AM5372 Barnum Brown and crew, working for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, collected a nearly complete articulated skeleton with a partial skull in 1915. These fossils were also found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, near Steveville, Alberta. Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer compared the finds, and, though they allowed that both specimens were from the same general locality and geological formation, they considered the specimen sufficiently distinct from the holotype to warrant erecting a new species, and described the fossils as Styracosaurus parksi, named in honor of William Parks. Among the differences between the specimens cited by Brown and Schlaikjer were a cheekbone quite different from that of S. albertensis, and smaller tail vertebrae. S. parksi also had a more robust jaw, a shorter dentary, and the frill differed in shape from that of the type species. However, much of the skull consisted of plaster reconstruction, and the original 1937 paper did not illustrate the actual skull bones. It is now accepted as a specimen of S. albertensis. In the summer of 2006, Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta relocated the long lost S. parksi site. Pieces of the skull, evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, were found in the quarry. These were collected and it is hoped more pieces will be found, perhaps enough to warrant a redescription of the skull and test whether S. albertensis and S. parksi are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial Styracosaurus skulls. At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed Styracosaurus bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous pieces of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill pieces. Holotype frill of S. ovatus, which was moved to Rubeosaurus A third species, S. ovatus, from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, was described by Gilmore in 1930. The fossil material is limited, with the best being a portion of the parietal bone of the frill, but one unusual feature is that the pair of spikes closest to the midline converge towards the midline, rather than away from it as in S. albertensis. There also may only have been two sets of spikes on each side of the frill, instead of three. The spikes are much shorter than in S. albertensis, with the longest only long. A 2010 review of styracosaur skull remains by Ryan, Holmes, and Russell found it to be a distinct species, and in 2010 McDonald and Horner placed it in its own genus, Rubeosaurus.Andrew T. McDonald & John R. Horner, (2010). \\"New Material of \\"Styracosaurus\\" ovatus from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana\\", In: Michael J. Ryan, Brenda J. Chinnery-Allgeier, and David A. Eberth (eds), New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs: The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium, Indiana University Press, 656 pp. Several other species which were assigned to Styracosaurus have since been assigned to other genera. S. sphenocerus, described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1890 as a species of Monoclonius and based on a nasal bone with a broken Styracosaurus-like straight nose horn, was attributed to Styracosaurus in 1915. \\"S. makeli\\", mentioned informally by amateur paleontologists Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas in 1990 in a caption to an illustration, is an early name for Einiosaurus. \\"S. borealis\\" is an early informal name for S. parksi. Description Size compared to a human Individuals of the genus Styracosaurus were approximately long as adults and weighed around 2.7 tonnes.Lambert, D. (1993). The Ultimate Dinosaur Book. Dorling Kindersley: New York, 152‚Äì167. . The skull was massive, with a large nostril, a tall straight nose horn, and a parietosquamosal frill (a neck frill) crowned with at least four large spikes. Each of the four longest frill spines was comparable in length to the nose horn, at long. The nasal horn was estimated by Lambe at long in the type specimen, but the tip had not been preserved. Based on other nasal horn cores from Styracosaurus and Centrosaurus, this horn may have come to a more rounded point at around half of that length. Restoration Aside from the large nasal horn and four long frill spikes, the cranial ornamentation was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the posterior margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in Centrosaurus. Others had less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. Others had much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, Styracosaurus had large fenestrae (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak. The bulky body of Styracosaurus resembled that of a rhinoceros. It had powerful shoulders which may have been useful in intraspecies combat. Styracosaurus had a relatively short tail. Each toe bore a hooflike ungual which was sheathed in horn. Various limb positions have been proposed for Styracosaurus and ceratopsids in general, including forelegs which were held underneath the body, or, alternatively, held in a sprawling position. The most recent work has put forward an intermediate crouched position as most likely. Classification Styracosaurus is a member of the Centrosaurinae. Other members of the clade include Centrosaurus (from which the group takes its name), Pachyrhinosaurus, Avaceratops, Einiosaurus, Albertaceratops, Achelousaurus, Brachyceratops,Dodson, P., Forster, C. A, and Sampson, S. D. (2004) Ceratopsidae. In: Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H. (eds.), The Dinosauria (second edition). Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 494‚Äì513. . and Monoclonius, although these last two are dubious. Because of the variation between species and even individual specimens of centrosaurines, there has been much debate over which genera and species are valid, particularly whether Centrosaurus and/or Monoclonius are valid genera, undiagnosable, or possibly members of the opposite sex. In 1996, Peter Dodson found enough variation between Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Monoclonius to warrant separate genera, and that Styracosaurus resembled Centrosaurus more closely than either resembled Monoclonius. Dodson also believed one species of Monoclonius, M. nasicornis, may actually have been a female Styracosaurus.Dodson, P. (1996). The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History. Princeton University Press: Princeton, New Jersey, pp. 197‚Äì199. . However, most other researchers have not accepted Monoclonius nasicornis as a female Styracosaurus, instead regarding it as a synonym of Centrosaurus apertus. While sexual dimorphism has been proposed for an earlier ceratopsian, Protoceratops, there is no firm evidence for sexual dimorphism in any ceratopsid. Ceratopsid skull casts positioned in a phylogenetic tree, in the Natural History Museum of Utah, with Styracosaurus at the far left Skull of the holotype specimen The cladogram depicted below represents a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba et al. (2017): =Origins and evolution= Biogeography of centrosaurine dinosaurs during the Campanian The evolutionary origins of Styracosaurus were not understood for many years because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of Protoceratops, in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships,Dodson, P. (1996). The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History. Princeton University Press: Princeton, New Jersey, p. 244. . but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of Styracosaurus may have looked like. These new discoveries have been important in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, and suggest that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, with the appearance of true horned ceratopsians occurring by the beginning of the late Cretaceous in North America. Goodwin and colleagues proposed in 1992 that Styracosaurus was part of the lineage leading to Einiosaurus, Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. This was based on a series of fossil skulls from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The position of Styracosaurus in this lineage is now equivocal, as the remains that were thought to represent Styracosaurus have been transferred to the genus Rubeosaurus. Styracosaurus is known from a higher position in the formation (relating specifically to its own genus) than the closely related Centrosaurus, suggesting that Styracosaurus displaced Centrosaurus as the environment changed over time and/or dimension. It has been suggested that Styracosaurus albertensis is a direct descendant of Centrosaurus (C. apertus or C. nasicornis), and that it in turn evolved directly into the slightly later species Rubeosaurus ovatus. Subtle changes can be traced in the arrangement of the horns through this lineage, leading from Rubeosaurus to Einiosaurus, to Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. However, the lineage may not be a simple, straight line, as a pachyrhinosaur-like species has been reported from the same time and place as Styracosaurus albertensis. Paleobiology Restoration Styracosaurus and other horned dinosaurs are often depicted in popular culture as herd animals. A bonebed composed of Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, about halfway up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits.Although this article mentioned two bonebeds, including BB 156, the recent review by Ryan et al. only accepted BB 42. The mass deaths may have been a result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with evidence suggesting the environment may have been seasonal and semiarid. Paleontologists Gregory Paul and Per Christiansen proposed that large ceratopsians such as Styracosaurus were able to run faster than an elephant, based on possible ceratopsian trackways which did not exhibit signs of sprawling forelimbs. =Dentition and diet= Styracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; they probably fed mostly on low growth because of the position of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting. Ceratopsid teeth, including those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns.Coe, M. J., Dilcher, D. L., Farlow, J. O., Jarzen, D. M., and Russell, D. A. (1987). Dinosaurs and land plants. In: Friis, E. M., Chaloner, W. G., and Crane, P. R. (eds.) The Origins of Angiosperms and their Biological Consequences Cambridge University Press, pp. 225‚Äì258. . Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.Dodson, P. (1996). The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History. Princeton University Press: Princeton, New Jersey, p. 266. . =Horns and frill= Close-up of the AM5372 skull, American Museum of Natural History The large nasal horns and frills of Styracosaurus are among the most distinctive facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered. Early in the 20th century, paleontologist R. S. Lull proposed that the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe to the idea that they completely filled in the fenestrae.Dodson, P. (1996). The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History. Princeton University Press: Princeton, New Jersey, p. 269. . C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.Forster, C. A. (1990). The cranial morphology and systematics of Triceratops, with a preliminary analysis of ceratopsian phylogeny. Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. 227 pp. OCLC 61500040 It was long believed that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study found no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, there is no evidence of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.Tanke, D. H, and Farke, A. A. (2006). Bone resorption, bone lesions, and extracranial fenestrae in ceratopsid dinosaurs: a preliminary assessment. in: Carpenter, K. (ed.). Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs Indiana University Press: Bloomington. pp. 319‚Äì347. . Variation in frill morphology; the top row are subadults, the rest are mature However, a newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions in Triceratops and Centrosaurus and showed that these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head; as Centrosaurus was more closely related to Styracosaurus and both genera had long nasal horns, the results for this genus would be more applicable for Styracosaurus. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. The large frill on Styracosaurus and related genera also may have helped to increase body area to regulate body temperature, like the ears of the modern elephant. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of Stegosaurus, although this use alone would not account for the bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of the Ceratopsidae. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display. The theory of frill use in sexual display was first proposed in 1961 by Davitashvili. This theory has gained increasing acceptance. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, can be seen in the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in vast majority of modern species of tetrapods (terrestrial vertebrates). A skull discovered in 2015 from a Styracosaurus indicates that individual variation was likely commonplace in the genus. The asymmetrical nature of the horns in the specimen has been compared to deer, which often have asymmetrical antlers in various individuals. The study carried out may also indicate that the genus Rubeosaurus may be synonymous with Styracosaurus as a result. Paleoecology Depiction of the megaherbivores in the Dinosaur Park Formation, Styracosaurus third from left, with herd in the right background Styracosaurus is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation, and was a member of a diverse and well-documented fauna of prehistoric animals that included horned relatives such as Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, duckbills such as Prosaurolophus, Lambeosaurus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus.Weishampel, David B.; Barrett, Paul M.; Coria, Rodolfo A.; Le Loeuff, Jean; Xu Xing; Zhao Xijin; Sahni, Ashok; Gomani, Elizabeth, M.P.; and Noto, Christopher R. (2004). \\"Dinosaur Distribution\\", in The Dinosauria (2nd ed.). Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 517‚Äì606. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward.Eberth, David A. \\"The geology\\", in Dinosaur Provincial Park, pp. 54‚Äì82. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons.

The club's home colours are white and black and the team mascot is a lion. History On November 14, 1914, the club was founded. On May 22, 1921, Uni√£o Barbarense's stadium was inaugurated. In 1921, the team affiliated to APEA (Associa√ß√£o Paulista de Esportes Atl√©ticos, \\"Paulista Association of Athletic Sports\\") and played their first match in S√£o Paulo State's Campeonato Oficial de Futebol Amador (Amateur Football Official Championship\\"). In 1948, the club was Amateur FPF (Federa√ß√£o Paulista de Futebol) champion of its Region. In 1956, Uni√£o Barbarense took a leave of FPF's Championship. In 1957, the club was Amateur champion of Liga Barbarense de Futebol (\\"Barbarense Football League\\")'s Barbarense Championship. In 1961, Uni√£o Barbarense was amateur champion of Liga Barbarense de Futebol's Ta√ßa Cidade. In 1963, the team was amateur champion of the last edition of Liga Barbarense de Futebol's Ta√ßa Cidade. In 1964, the club affiliated to FPF, became a professional club and competed in the Campeonato Paulista. In 1966, Uni√£o Barbarense was promoted to Campeonato Paulista Second Division. In 1967, the club was promoted to Campeonato Paulista First Division, just one division below the Special Division. In 1968, Uni√£o Barbarense competed in the Campeonato Paulista First Division. In 1972, the club took a leave of FPF's Championship, returning in the following year. In 1974, Uni√£o Barbarense finished in Campeonato Paulista First Division's fourth place (there was no promotion to the Special Division in that year). In 1975, the club finished in Campeonato Paulista First Division's third place (there was no promotion to the Special Division in that year). In 1977 and 1978, the club was not included in the Intermediate Division, created in 1977, so, Uni√£o Barbarense did not play in any FPF competition. In 1979, Uni√£o Barbarense returned to play in FPF competitions. The team competed in the Campeonato Paulista Third Division. The Third Division, besides its name, was actually the fifth level of Campeonato Paulista. In 1980, the FPF created a Second Division and promoted Barbarense to this division. In 1990, the club was Campeonato Paulista Second Division's runner-up, returning to the Intermediate Division. In 1991, Uni√£o Barbarense competed in the Campeonato Paulista Intermediate Division. In 1994, the FPF restructured the Paulista competitions in A-1 (first level), A-2 (second level) and A-3 (third level). Uni√£o Barbarense was placed in A-3 and finished in tenth place. In 1995, Uni√£o Barbarense took a leave of Campeonato Paulista A-3. In the same year, Ant√¥nio Guimar√£es Stadium was expanded and modernized. In 1996, Uni√£o Barbarense competed again in the Campeonato Paulista A-3. In 1997, The club was Campeonato Paulista A-3's runner-up, and was promoted to the following year's A-2. In 1998, Uni√£o Barbarense was A-2 champion, thus being promoted to the following year's Campeonato Paulista First Division. In 1999 the club competed in the Campeonato Paulista First Division for the first time. In 2004, Uni√£o Barbarense was Campeonato Brasileiro Third Division champion, and was promoted to Campeonato Brasileiro Second Division. In 2005, the club was relegated to Campeonato Paulista Second Division (A-2). In 2005, Uni√£o Barbarense was relegated to Campeonato Brasileiro Third Division, after ending the league in 20th. Stadium Ant√¥nio Guimar√£es Stadium views. Uni√£o Barbarense play their games at Est√°dio Ant√¥nio Lins Ribeiro Guimar√£es, which has capacity to house 14,914 fans. Ant√¥nio Lins Ribeiro Guimar√£es stadium is a football stadium in the city of Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste, in the State of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. Its name was given in honor of a former president and patron of the club. The correct name is Est√°dio Ant√¥nio Guimar√£es, but the spoken press prefers to call the Est√°dio Ant√¥nio Lins Ribeiro Guimar√£es, full name of patron and former president, by finding more \\"sound\\" and ended up being used by other professionals in the sports industry.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 20, 1998. After Homer prevents Mayor Quimby and Mark Hamill from being trampled at a convention, Homer trains to become a bodyguard and is employed by Quimby. After Homer discovers Quimby has been making corrupt deals with Fat Tony and forces him to end the deal, Fat Tony threatens to kill Quimby, leaving Homer to defend the Mayor from threats. The episode was written by Ron Hauge and directed by Swinton O. Scott III, and received positive reviews from critics overall. Plot While watching television, the Simpson family sees a commercial for the \\"Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con\\", a science-fiction convention featuring Mark Hamill and others, and decide to attend. A riot breaks out at the convention after Hamill offers the chance for someone in the crowd to act out a scene with him. Homer notices that Hamill and Mayor Quimby are in danger of being trampled due to the riot and quickly rescues them. In gratitude, Quimby employs Homer as his bodyguard. Homer begins training at \\"Leavelle's Bodyguard Academy,\\" where he quickly graduates and begins his new job. Unbeknownst to Homer, Quimby made a deal with Fat Tony shortly after Homer was employed to provide milk to the schools of Springfield. Homer discovers the milk is from rats and confronts Quimby, accidentally knocking him out a window. Discovering Quimby hanging from a ledge, Homer makes him promise to expose Fat Tony in return for being pulled to safety. Quimby organizes the arrests of Fat Tony and his men, but Fat Tony threatens Quimby's life. Scared at having to defend Quimby due to the death threats, Homer attempts to reassure the Mayor by taking him to a dinner theater to see Hamill portray Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls. Homer discovers Fat Tony is there alongside his henchman, Louie, having been released on bail, and unwittingly made the situation worse when he did what Fat Tony told him to do by planting a kiss on Mayor Quimby, oblivious to the fact that he had given the Mayor the kiss of death. Louie attempts to stab Quimby but is stopped in a scuffle with Homer after Hamill advises Homer to \\"use the forks.\\" However, Fat Tony is still able to savagely beat Quimby with a baseball bat. Hamill says to Homer that Quimby will be fine, and Homer helps Hamill escape from the paparazzi. Production Mark Hamill (pictured) guest starred as himself and instructor Leavelle. Ron Hauge, writer of the episode, wanted to do an episode where he would use Homer's qualities such as oafishness, brute strength, thickness, and loyalty, for good. When Lisa says they have to go back for Maggie after the family escape the riot, Homer says \\"Forget Maggie, she's gone.\\" Matt Groening claims this to be one of his favorite quotes in the show. Hamill only agreed to guest star if he was allowed to voice a character as well as himself. He stated that he loved doing the voice for bodyguard instructor Leavelle a lot more than he did providing the voice for himself. Cultural references The Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con science- fiction convention features numerous references to the genre. As well as Mark Hamill, guests at the convention include ALF from the television series ALF, Tom Baker in costume as the Fourth Doctor from the series Doctor Who, Gort from the film The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Godzilla from the film series of the same name and Jonathan Harris in costume as Dr. Zachary Smith from the series Lost in Space TV show, as well as the robot from the show. Real-life astronaut Neil Armstrong is also a guest. Among the attendees is √úter, who wears a Futurama shirt; Futurama, an animated science-fiction comedy which was created by The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, did not premiere until the following year. Seymour Skinner is dressed as Spock from Star Trek, as are several others, and Edna Krabappel is dressed as Barbarella from the comic and film Barbarella (1968). Other costumes include Xena from the series Xena: Warrior Princess, Terminator from The Terminator film series, Griffin from the novel The Invisible Man (1897) and later the comic book series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, as well as a Borg and Geordi La Forge from Star Trek. When Comic Book Guy meets a girl with similar interests to him at the convention, Alexander Courage's piece \\"Under the Spell\\" from the original Star Trek pilot \\"The Cage\\" is played. A booth for the comic book Roswell, Little Green Man is seen at the convention; the comic was published by Groening's Bongo Comics Group. The episode contains multiple references to Star Wars, the film series in which Hamill starred. Throughout the episode, Hamill wears the costume of his Star Wars character Luke Skywalker, and tells Homer to \\"use the forks,\\" spoofing the line \\"use the Force \\" from the series. The convention features a tag-team wrestling match which sees \\"the mighty robots\\" (the Cylons) from the series Battlestar Galactica fight the \\"gay robots\\" (R2-D2 and C-3PO) from Star Wars. Somebody at the convention wears a costume of the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Homer and Mayor Quimby attend a production of the musical Guys and Dolls (1955), starring Hamill as Nathan Detroit, who sings the Star Wars-themed \\"Luke, Be a Jedi Tonight\\" to the tune of \\"Luck Be a Lady\\". Leavelle's design is based on Texan detective Jim Leavelle, as he appeared when escorting Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on a cart. This is a reference to the grassy knoll at the site of President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film Executive Action (1973). The plot shares elements with the film The Bodyguard (1992), particularly Homer carrying Hamill away from the crowd at the end. Leavelle sings the song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" by Dolly Parton which was popularized by Whitney Houston as the theme for The Bodyguard; it also plays at the end. After believing he has killed Mayor Quimby, Homer decides to take inspiration from the film Weekend at Bernie's (1989) and \\"use the body to stage an elaborate farce.\\" The title of the episode is a reference to the film Married to the Mob (1988). During the Guys and Dolls scene the cast members sing a song with the musical's title to the tune of \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\", which as Mark Hamill points out isn't one of the show's musical numbers. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Mayored to the Mob\\" finished 24th in ratings for the week of December 14‚Äì20, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.5 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Ally McBeal. Empire named Hamill's performance in the episode as the tenth-best film gag in the show, commenting: \\"As a rule, celebrity cameos are rubbish, but good sport Hamill is hilarious when singing 'Luke, be a Jedi tonight' in a production of Guys and Dolls, and makes this list for urging bodyguard Homer to 'use the forks.'\\"Colin Kennedy. \\"The Ten Best Movie Gags In The Simpsons\\", Empire, September 2004, pp. 77 Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski of IGN marked Hamill's guest appearance second on a list of \\"Top 25 Simpsons Guest appearances\\" saying that much of the episode's humor came from Hamill being \\"a good sport about his past\\". In addition, Hamill ranked 18th on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars, and Total Film's Nathan Ditum ranked his performance as the third-best guest appearance in the show's history. Simon Crerar of The Times also listed Hamill's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of The Simpsons. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that \\"the best bits all involve either the convention or Mark Hamill's repeated attempts to not be mobbed. Sadly, the main thrust of the story ‚Äì Homer's protection of Quimby from Don Tony ‚Äì falls a bit flat. Nevertheless, when the jokes run free, they are of exceptionally high quality.\\" In his review of The Simpsons' tenth season, James Plath of Dvdtown.com notes \\"Mayored to the Mob\\" to be \\"one of the funnier episodes.\\" IGN named it as the best episode of season 10. In an interview with Australian newspaper mX, season 10 show runner Mike Scully marked \\"Mayored to the Mob\\" as fourth in his top-five episodes from season 10. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 10th season.

The show, designed to introduce viewers to the basics of Spanish, had two seasons, beginning in 1992. Its 52 episodes are often used for educational purposes in schools and are still broadcast regularly on many PBS stations, as well as many local channels. Destinos was produced by WGBH Boston and funded by the Annenberg/CPB Project, with additional funding by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation. Format Destinos uses the telenovela (Spanish soap opera) format to teach Spanish-language communication and comprehension skills. Early episodes have English-language narration in addition to the Spanish-language dialogue, but the English language content decreases continually, eventually disappearing entirely. The viewer is introduced to various accents and dialects and the cultures of various Spanish-speaking countries. The series consists of 52 videos that cover virtually the entire scope of Spanish grammar, including verb tenses of present, future (including future of uncertainty), imperfect, preterite, perfect, pluperfect, participles, and the present, imperfect, and perfect forms of the subjunctive. It also covers a variety of country-specific usages: for example, it uses both the verb extra√±ar (to miss somebody or something) and the phrase echar de menos (which means the same thing). After the early episodes, the conversation is done at more or less normal speaking speed, improving the student's comprehension. Spanish subtitles are included on both VHS and DVD versions -- translations are not provided. The DVDs are available from the Annenberg/CPB project website. An accompanying set of materials is available to complement the series. These include a set of audio tapes and textbook, the latter of which follows the series episode-for-episode but provides a more systematic presentation such as would be used in a classroom course. Destinos is also characterized by frequent reviews of preceding episodes. This characteristic may make the series seem to be overly long and excessive, but there is a purpose to the reviews: it provides extensive repetition, which helps many people learn the material. Main characters * Fernando Castillo Saavedra (Augusto Benedico) -- The patriarch of the Destinos family was born in Spain but immigrated to Mexico following the Spanish Civil War. Don Fernando initiates an investigation after receiving a letter from a stranger, an acquaintance of his first wife, Rosario del Valle, whom he had long presumed killed in the civil war. The stranger, Teresa Su√°rez, lives in Spain and learned of Don Fernando's existence from a newspaper article. Sra. Su√°rez claims that Rosario survived the war and that she and Don Fernando have a son. Don Fernando is presently a widower and is in ill health. With his second wife, Carmen M√°rquez de Castillo, he had four children who are still living: Ram√≥n, Carlos, Juan, and Mercedes. He is a retired industrialist who owns La Gavia, a vast, reconstructed estate northwest of Mexico City, D.F. * Raquel Rodr√≠guez Orozco (Liliana Abud) -- was born in the United States and lives in Los Angeles though she has family in Mexico and has visited there frequently. She is a lawyer contracted by Don Fernando's brother, Pedro, and the Castillo-Saavedra family to conduct the investigation. Her research leads her first to Spain to find Teresa Su√°rez. She subsequently travels to Argentina, Puerto Rico, and Mexico in her search to discover the truth about Don Fernando's first wife, Rosario, and the child they had together. * √Ångel Castillo del Valle -- The only son of Rosario and Don Fernando was born in Seville, Spain in 1937 and died in 1991. He lived his entire life believing his father had died in the Spanish Civil War. He grew up in Argentina, where his mother immigrated after the war. √Ångel was a sailor for a short (and unsuccessful) period of time and made his living as an artist after moving to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There he married and had two children: Angela and Roberto. * Arturo Iglesias del Valle (Arturo Puig) -- was born in Argentina and lives in Buenos Aires. He is a psychiatrist, the only son of Rosario and Mart√≠n Iglesias and half-brother to √Ångel. He agrees to assist Raquel in her search for √Ångel, with whom he has lost contact. Arturo also develops a relationship with Raquel during her time in Buenos Aires. This occurs around Episodio 14. * Angela Castillo Soto (Yasm√≠n Pereira) -- Was born in and lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She is the only daughter of √Ångel and is a computer programmer by profession. She attended the Interamericana de Puerto Rico in San Germ√°n but now lives in the apartment previously owned by her parents. * Roberto Castillo Soto (Edwin Francisco) -- Was born in San Juan and currently lives in an unnamed small town in Mexico, where he is taking part in an archeological dig. The only son of √Ångel, Roberto is an archeology student and is the last major character introduced in the series. Supporting educational materials Educational material has been released to accompany the episodes. The first episode refers to these as one textbook, two workbooks and audiocassettes.

He had discovered that his first wife, Rosario, did not die in the Spanish Civil War as he had believed, but had survived and had an unknown child. In the course of her investigation of the case, Raquel travels to a number of Spanish-speaking areas -- Seville and Madrid, Spain; Buenos Aires, Argentina; San Juan and San Germ√°n, Puerto Rico; and Mexico -- has a number of adventures and mishaps, meets a love interest (Arturo Puig) and faces a number of melodramatic conflicts. Recurring plot elements include Raquel traveling in pursuit of the investigation, letters (primarily to determine last known addresses of people), comic mix-ups, and death (although nobody dies during the series, many characters are found to have died and Don Fernando is on the verge of dying). =Details= The Beginning: In a large estate called La Gavia outside Mexico City, a very old Don Fernando has been keeping a secret for some time: he received a letter, from one Se√±ora Teresa Su√°rez of Seville, Spain, stating that his first wife, Rosario, did not die in the Spanish Civil War as he had thought. Fernando's (unspecified) medical problems are increasing, however, and when he starts seeing hallucinations of Rosario he finally decides to act. He gathers his entire extended family, which includes the families of his children, Juan, Carlos, Ramon, and Mercedes, together and explains to them that he wants to find out what happened to Rosario, who was pregnant when they lost contact. His brother Pedro hires Raquel, a lawyer of his acquaintance, to investigate. Spain Arc: Raquel first travels to Seville to meet Sra. Su√°rez. She meets and spends time with family members, son Miguel, and Sra. Suarez' grandson Jaime, and soon learns from them that Sra. Su√°rez has since moved to Madrid and won't talk by telephone. Raquel travels to Madrid; after a comic mix-up of identities and hotel rooms, where she is thought to be the winner of the Spanish lottery, she then meets Sra. Su√°rez's son and is taken to see her. She learns that Rosario has moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina and is given the address from Rosario's last letter. She also learns that Rosario had likewise thought Fernando had died in the war and that Rosario and Fernando have a son named Angel. In parting, Sra. Su√°rez's last words to Raquel prove prophetic: \\"Life is not all work: you also need to dedicate some time to your heart!\\" Argentina Arc: Raquel then travels to Argentina to search for Rosario. When she finds that Rosario no longer lives at the address on the letter Sra. Su√°rez gave her (the Estancia Santa Susana, a real tourist ranch near Buenos Aires), she follows a lead from a local gaucho, happens upon the office of psychiatrist Dr. Arturo Iglesias, and soon finds out he is Angel's half-brother and a son of Rosario. Arturo takes Raquel to the family crypt, and there, Raquel discovers that Rosario had actually died. For years, Arturo has been estranged from Angel, whom he blamed for his father's deadly heart attack. Arturo and Raquel begin a long search for acquaintances of Angel in his last known location, an Italian seaport neighborhood of Buenos Aires called La Boca. Armed only with a picture of a 20-year-old Angel, they eventually find an outgoing old sailor named H√©ctor Condotti, who remembers his good friend Angel. After several days, during which Raquel and Arturo start to develop a romance, H√©ctor produces a letter with Angel's address in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico Arc: Raquel then flies to San Juan and goes to the address in Old San Juan. From a neighbor, Raquel finds out that Angel died only a few months ago and had a wife who died several years before. While photographing the grave of Angel, Raquel runs into Angel's daughter, Angela. She tells Angela the whole story, including that she has a grandfather in Mexico and an uncle in Argentina she has never heard of. Raquel also finds out that Angela has a brother, Roberto, living in Mexico. Angela's stern aunt Olga does not want her to travel to Mexico with Raquel, but after a trip to see her grandmother in San Germ√°n, her grandmother gives her blessing to travel. Along the two-hour trip to San Germ√°n, they have car trouble and must stay overnight in Ponce. Finally, we meet Angela's boyfriend and nauseating mujeriego (\\"womanizer\\"), Jorge. He makes several clumsy passes at Raquel. A mild fight between Raquel and Angela ensues; not because Raquel tells Angela about the passes (she decides not to based on advice from her mother), but because Angela thinks the world of him and wants to give him a significant amount of money to start a theater. Nonetheless, Raquel and Angela are about to travel together to Mexico when they learn that Angela's brother Roberto has been trapped in an archaeological excavation in Mexico. Mexico/Rescuing Roberto Arc: Raquel and Angela travel to Mexico, where they quickly drive to a small town where Roberto is trapped in a pre-Columbian excavation. Arturo was to meet them in Mexico City, but they cannot get in contact with him, so he spends several days in Mexico City wondering what happened to them, while they stay at a local church. Several episodes (possibly the slowest in the series) pass where Raquel and Angela are waiting for Roberto to be rescued and Arturo is wondering what happened to Raquel. Finally, Roberto is rescued and Angela and Roberto meet their uncle Arturo. Love Triangle Arc: After Raquel calls her mother back in Los Angeles to catch up, her mother hatches a scheme to get Raquel back together with Luis, an old boyfriend. Luis called and talked to Raquel's mother and began trying to get back into Raquel's life. Luis impressed Raquel's mother with his apparent maturity and wealth, so, despite her advice to Raquel not to get mixed up in other people's lives, and despite her husband's misgivings, she invites Luis down to Mexico unbeknownst to Raquel. Arturo and Luis meet, resulting in some tense moments, but they generally get along well, leaving Raquel wondering what is happening. Finally, Arturo meets Raquel's parents. Arturo finds Raquel's father is amiable but her mother is clearly not. Raquel had by now figured out that her mother asked Luis to come down to Mexico, and a fight between the two ensues. Her mother finally admits that the only reason she's opposed to Arturo is that she's afraid that Raquel, their only daughter, will move to Argentina with Arturo. After Raquel assures her she will not leave her parents alone, her mother has a change of heart. When Luis presents Raquel with tickets to go away for a romantic weekend with him, she tells him that there is no chance. Luis leaves a good-bye note for Raquel and returns to the United States. Family Problems Arc: Meanwhile, after Don Fernando is transported to Guadalajara to see a medical specialist, a financial irregularity comes to light. Don Fernando's son Carlos has been embezzling money from the family company's office in Miami. It turns out that his wife, Gloria, is a gambling addict and Carlos took the money to bail her out. The whole family company (including the La Gavia ranch) is endangered. Because of this, they close the Miami office and consider selling the ranch. Another monetary difficulty arises, this time between Angela and Roberto, over the fact that she wants to give her part of the money from the sale of their father's home to her Jorge. Avuncular Arturo starts playing mediator and tries to talk them through the situation. Doubts (Review Arc): Finally, they all meet Don Fernando. It is a happy meeting, though Fernando is near death, so when Don Fernando suddenly walks in on their reunion dinner fully dressed and looking quite a bit stronger, they are all confused. To their amazement, Don Fernando tells them that he doubts their story: he does not believe that Arturo is really his step-son and Angela and Roberto are really his grandchildren. This device gives Raquel an opportunity to review the entire series, which takes four episodes. At Long Last (Final Arc): At last, Don Fernando is convinced, not just because of Raquel's recounting and documentation, but because Angela produces a matching wedding cup that was passed from Rosario to Angel, to Angela's grandmother, to Angela. Another plot element is tied up when it turns out that Don Fernando has been squirreling away money all along, with the intention of turning the family ranch into an orphanage after his death. Carlos loves kids, having taken care of their kids while Gloria was out gambling, so they name Carlos the leader of the new orphanage. Finale: To wrap up the series, Arturo expresses his interest to move to Los Angeles to be with Raquel, since he has no family and few friends in Argentina.  Trivia  * Augusto Benedico died before filming was finished; the ending used previously shot footage of Don Fernando. * Maricarmen, daughter of Ram√≥n and granddaughter of Don Fernando, is the real- life daughter of Liliana Abud. * Pati's assistant in the theater production in New York City is played by series creator VanPatten. * Jorge Mart√≠nez de Hoyos (playing Pedro) was familiar to American viewers from his role as Mexican villager Hilario in the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven. Nuevos Destinos A follow-up story, Nuevos Destinos was produced by WGBH and McGraw-Hill for Annenberg in 1997. It revisits the Destinos story six years later as Raquel encounters a new family mystery. The episodes are only 15 minutes long in this sequel, and some major characters from the earlier series, such as Arturo, do not appear outside of flashbacks but may be mentioned or play a role behind the scenes. Nuevos Destinos includes about three hours of video, with an accompanying immersive CD-ROM that allows the user to help Raquel discover what is going on.

Barrancos is famous in Portugal for its festival, which takes place each year during the last four days of August, and where traditional bullfighting occurs in the town's main square. History The territory where the Barrancos municipality stands today was initially conquered from the Moors in 1167, by Gon√ßalo Mendes da Maia, and the area's population was ordered by D. Sancho I in 1200. The original municipality was then located in the village of Noudar, which would only be definitively incorporated in the Kingdom of Portugal in the year 1295, when it was granted foral by D. Dinis. Noudar village was extinct in 1825, beginning a slow process of abandonment and migration to Barrancos. Noudar, with its castle and old village ruins, is today one of the landmarks of the region. It is located 12 km to the northwest of Barrancos. Dialect In Barrancos the Barranquenho dialect is spoken.

He was the last cardinal protector of England. Life Campeggio was born in Milan, the eldest of five sons. In 1500, he took his doctorate in canon and civil law at Bologna and married Francesca Guastavillani with whom he had five children. When she died in 1509, Campeggio began an ecclesiastical career under Pope Julius II's patronage. He was soon appointed to two diplomatic missions, both against the Council of Pisa, first to the emperor Maximilian I, who gave him the Bishopric of Feltre in 1512 (held until 1520), and then in 1512‚Äì13 to the Duke of Milan. In 1513 he returned to Germany seeking a league against the Turks. Pope Leo X made him a Cardinal on 1 July 1517, and Maximilian made him Cardinal‚Äìprotector of the Holy Roman Empire. On 3 March 1518 he was sent to England as part of Leo's peace policy. This gave Thomas Wolsey the chance to become legate himself by using permission for Campeggio to enter England as leverage, and then to outmanoeuvre the new legate when he arrived, taking over the process of peace-making which led to the Treaty of London in 1519. He was also a member of Johann Goritz's humanist sodality. Campeggio was appointed cardinal‚Äìprotector of England on 22 January 1523. He was not involved in much English business, except for the referring of episcopal provisions in consistory. The election of Pope Adrian VI in 1522 cemented his position in the Roman Curia. Campeggio wrote his De depravato statu ecclesiae for Adrian, which proposed radical reforms for the papal bureaucracy. On 2 December 1524 he received the bishopric of Salisbury, which he had been promised in 1518. The election of Pope Clement VII in 1523 further exalted Campeggio's power. Clement made him bishop of Bologna on 2 December 1523 (held until 1525) and then on 9 January 1524 legate to the Diet of Nuremberg. During the sack of Rome in 1527, Campeggio lost everything. Clement, who fled to Orvieto, left him behind as papal legate in the city, just when the English political situation required his attention. Wolsey and Henry VIII expected his support for their proposal that a papal co-legate should decide Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon in co-operation with Wolsey. Campeggio had, however, already given a legal opinion to the Pontiff supporting the validity of the marriage. Nevertheless, he was named legate on 8 June 1528, after a joint commission with Wolsey had been agreed on 13 April. Campeggio arrived in London on 8 October 1528 and held the first of many sessions with Wolsey and Henry, the first English King to sue before a papal judge in person. Campeggio found himself in a difficult position, since Emperor Charles V, Catherine of Aragon's nephew, was determined to prevent the divorce, and was putting pressure on Clement. The deciding point in law for Campeggio was Julius's dispensation for Henry and Catherine's marriage. In Catherine's possession from early in 1528, she showed it to Campeggio in October, and he took it to invalidate his commission, since the latter failed to cover the document. He tried to make the case disappear on 23 July 1529 by proroguing it until October, but this was forestalled by the Pope sending the matter to Rome a week earlier. On his way back to Rome, Campeggio met Charles and Clement in Bologna, where the pope gave Campeggio the castle of Dozza and the Emperor took Campeggio's family under his patronage. Charles later (2 September 1530) gave Campeggio the Spanish bishopric of Huesca and Jaca, which he held until 17 June 1534 when he became bishop of Candia (Crete) (until 1536); in 1532, moreover, when making Campeggio's son Gianbattista bishop of Majorca, the emperor reserved the administration of the see to the young man's father. Campeggio was legate to the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, where he pursued negotiations with Philip Melanchthon. By 20 May 1531, Henry had dismissed Campeggio as legate. In August 1533, he lost the revenues of Salisbury, and on 21 March 1534 was deprived of the bishopric by act of Parliament; also deprived was Girolamo Ghinucci, Bishop of Worcester. Campeggio was a member of the commission which excommunicated Henry in 1535. He remained protector of Germany until his death, at the same time devoting much energy to insuring the future of his family; his two sons, two brothers, and one nephew all became bishops. He was named legate to the general council called first at Mantua and then at Vicenza, but he attended only the first session in May 1538. He died on 25 July 1539, aged sixty-four, and was buried in Santa Maria in Trastevere; in 1571 at least some of his bones were transferred to the church of Santi Marta e Bernardino that he had built in Bologna.

A peasant's son born in Agerola, in the province of Salerno near Amalfi (in southern Italy), he served in the Neapolitan militia during the Napoleonic wars. After Waterloo he drifted east like many other adventurous soldiers. In 1820 he joined the army of the Shah of Persia, attaining the rank of colonel and receiving several decorations before returning to Italy in 1824. He joined the army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab in 1827, and later also received various civilian appointments. In 1829 he was made administrator of Wazirabad and in 1837 he succeeded Hari Singh Nalwa as governor of Peshawar. He remained in the Punjab until the assassination of Maharaja Sher Singh in 1843, after which he retired to Italy, where his rank as a general was confirmed and he was knighted.  Career in Europe  The young Avitabile served in the local levies of the Kingdom of Naples between 1807 and 1809, when he joined the artillery of the regular army. As a part of the Imperial Army, Avitabile served under Murat on several campaigns. In these campaigns he earned the rank of Lieutenant, as well as the command of the 15th Battery. After the fall of Napoleon and the defeat of Murat at Tolentino, Naples was restored to Ferdinand I of Sicily. Avitabile retained his rank and command and joined the army of the new Kingdom of Two Sicilies, where he joined the siege of Gaeta under the command of the Austrian general Delaver. During this siege, he displayed great bravery and was wounded twice. The general recommended him for a promotion and a decoration, but was not heard. Avitabile was transferred instead to a position of lieutenant in a regiment of light infantry. It is said he quit in disgust over this treatment. His European career had come to an end.  In Persia  Having quit the army in Naples, Avitabile set his eyes on a career abroad. His initial idea was to, as many of his countrymen, seek fortune in America but this ended in a shipwreck off Marseille. Instead, he was advised to seek employment to the east. In Constantinople he was approached by an agent of the Persian Shah Fath Ali Shah recruiting European officers; in 1820, Avitabile took service with the Persian Shah. He remained in this employment for six years, during which period he rose to the rank of khan and a grade of colonel in the Persian army. Here he also met Claude August Court who would later accompany him on the travel to Punjab. Avitabile was rewarded for his services by two of Persia's highest decorations as Grand Commander of The Lion and Sun and of The Two Lions and Crown, but found the pay lacking. When he heard favourable notice from Jean-Baptiste Ventura of his employment in Punjab Ventura again broke up to travel further to the east.  In Punjab  Together with Court, Avitabile arrived in Lahore in 1827 and was hired by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He was given a position with the artillery and put in charge of the arsenal and gun foundries. He was also given a civilian position as governor of Wazirabad. It would seem he was an able administrator, as he held the position for the next seven years and as a result, Wazirabad prospered.  In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Image of \\"Abu Tabela\\", famous nickname of Paolo Avitabile in Afganistan In 1834 he was appointed governor of Peshawar, an area the Maharaja had conquered from the Afghans the previous year. Where as his rule of Wazirabad is described as just and rigorous, his governorship of Peshawar is depicted as a rule of \\"gallows and gibbets\\". Avitabile boasted: > \\"When I marched into Peshawar, I sent on in advance a number of wooden posts > which my men erected around the walls of the city. The men scoffed at them > and laughed at the madness of the feringhee [a disparaging local language > term for Westerners], and harder still when my men came in and laid coils of > rope at the foot of the posts...However, when my preparations were completed > and they found one fine morning dangling from these posts, fifty of the > worse characters in Peshawar, they thought different. And I repeated the > exhibition every day till I had made a scarcity of brigands and murderers. > Then I had to deal with the liars and tale bearers. My method with them was > to cut out their tongues. When a surgeon appeared and professed to be able > to restore their speech, I sent for him and cut out his tongue also. After > that there was peace\\".Macintyre, Ben The Man Who Would Be King, New York: > Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 2002 pages 194-195. With a ruthless, at times brutal, style of government, Avitabile established order in the province where he became known as Abu Tabela. Summary executions became usual, and it is said that he would have people executed by throwing them from the top of Mahabat Khan Mosque. The American adventurer Alexander Gardner wrote about Avitabile's rule in Peshawar: \\"Under his rule small pains are taken to distinguish between innocence and guilt, and many a man, ignorant of the alleged crime, pays for it with his life\\".Macintyre, Ben The Man Who Would Be King, New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 2002 pages 194-195. While this brutality was shocking to visiting Europeans (in the words of Sir Henry Lawrence: he acts like a savage among savage men, instead of showing them that a Christian can wield the iron sceptre without staining it by needless cruelty), it proved both successful in maintaining order and even popular among the peaceful inhabitants. His iron fist rule over Peshawar has made a place for him in local folklore. Even today unruly children in the city are brought to control by invoking Abu Tabela's name. In times of unrest, law- abiding citizens send a small wish for the return of an Abu Tabela to finally re-impose law and order. The control of this strategic position brought him in contact with the British army during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839‚Äì42), where he was able to render vital assistance. As governor of Peshawar, Avitabile controlled the southern entrance to the Khyber Pass, although the Maharaja did not allow for the British to move through the Sikh Empire to reach the Khyber pass, he ordered Avitable to assist the British through the pass itself, into Afghanistan. During Elphinstone's advance in 1839, the British were well received in Peshawar and their officers received a princely treatment. Captain Havelock spent a month in Peshawar, and describes the splendour of Avitabile's court in his memoirs. He also gives a favourable characterisation of the governor: \\"He is, moreover, a frank, gay, and good- humoured person, as well as an excellent and skilful officer.\\" Avitabile was also a scholar and an engineer, who worked very closely with the most brilliant Sikh engineer Lehna Singh Majithia. When the British returned in 1842, to avenge the defeat of Elphinstone, they were given every possible assistance by Avitabile's government, while he was still in the employ of the Sikh Empire as the Afghans had been a longtime enemy of the Sikhs. Avitabile remained in the position of Governor during the First Anglo-Afghan War until he left in 1843. Having secured his retirement in Europe, he resigned his position to return home. Back home As one of the few European adventurers in the area, he succeeded in building a fortune and getting away with it. He returned to Naples, where he built a grand home in San Lazzaro (Agerola). He obtained in 1844 that his place of birth, Agerola, was separated from Amalfi and united to the \\"Provincia di Napoli\\". He died in \\"strange\\" circumstances soon after marrying a local girl: Enrichetta Coccia. The following legal battle over his inheritance, and the many distant relatives asserting their claims, made Avitabile's cousin something of a byword in Italy. In fiction Avitabile is a minor character in Flashman, a 1969 novel by George MacDonald Fraser. The narrator describes him as a \\"great, grey-bearded ox of a man... the Sikhs and Afghans were more scared of him than of the Devil himself.\\" Despite Avitabile never facing Sikhs in battle himself or even having a reputation among common Sikhs or his fellow soldiers. Honours and awards Avitabile won honours in every country he served.

In this episode, Buffy follows Angel back to Los Angeles, where she confronts him about his surreptitious assistance back in Sunnydale. They are attacked by a Mohra demon; when Angel kills the demon he is restored to life by its powerful blood. After The Oracles ‚Äî a link to The Powers That Be ‚Äî confirm he is human again, Angel and Buffy spend a blissful night together. When Doyle receives a vision that the Mohra has regenerated itself, Angel leaves to kill the demon for good. In the ensuing battle, Angel discovers the consequences of having only human strength; Buffy must come to his rescue and slay the demon herself. Angel returns to The Oracles, who agree to turn back time so that Angel, accepting the entire cost of the bargain, can kill the Mohra before its blood makes him human. This episode is #78 on the TV Guide list of TV's Top 100 Episodes of all time. Plot Buffy surprises Angel with a visit to Los Angeles. Their emotion-driven discussion is interrupted by the arrival of a Mohra demon. Angel stabs the demon, but it retreats to the sewers. Buffy and Angel hesitantly follow, discussing their future as a couple and the feelings about each other. They split up; Angel meets the demon on his route. As they fight, the Mohra demon cuts Angel. Angel kills the demon. Its blood, eventually found to be the Blood of Eternity, merges with his own, and he becomes human. Realizing what this means for their relationship, Angel spends the night with Buffy. However, Doyle shares the news that the Mohra demon is alive: the demon's rejuvenating blood also worked on itself. So, Angel sets out with Doyle to kill the demon, without Buffy's much-needed supernatural assistance. Angel fails miserably until Buffy shows up and slays the demon. Angel realizes how useless he is in his human form, and asks the Oracles to turn back time to make him a \\"demon with a soul\\" once more. They consent, and time is set back twenty four hours despite a heartbroken Buffy begging Angel to remain human before the Mohra demon is killed, with only Angel as a witness to the night he and Buffy shared in the erased timeline. Production details In his essay on the music used in Angel, Matthew Mills points out how, when Angel asks the Oracles to turn back time, the slow tempo and use of the clarinet in the background music adds \\"emotive weight to the Oracles' sympathy\\" for his situation. As the Oracles explain that only Angel will remember the moments he shared with Buffy, Angel's theme ends on a minor key, underscoring the sacrifice being made. \\"Angel is one of those heroes who flourish on frustration,\\" Peter S. Beagle says, \\"who thrive on never achieving their hearts' desire.\\" This episode, in which Angel relinquishes the chance to have a normal, happy life with Buffy in order to \\"fulfill his penance,\\" perfectly typifies Angel's character and fate, says Beagle. =Writing= =Arc significance= *This is the second time in the series Angel gives up a chance at happiness. In the episode, \\"In the Dark\\", he relinquishes the ability to walk in the sun. * This episode is the first time that Angel makes an arrangement that causes those around him to forget something significant in order to protect those he loves. In the season four finale, \\"Home\\", Angel alters everyone's memories so that his son, Connor, can have a normal life. * This is the first appearance of The Oracles, a pair of humanoid beings, brother and sister, both unpredictable and self-important, that serve and speak for The Powers That Be. The Oracles last appear at the end of season one, in \\"To Shanshu in L.A.\\" * The Shanshu Prophecy is implied during Angel's meeting with the Oracles. =Continuity= * Crossover with Buffy: This episode follows the events of \\"Pangs,\\" which aired immediately before. * When Buffy snarks at Angel, \\"I was really jonesing for another heartbreaking sewer talk,\\" she refers to events in the season three Buffy episode, \\"The Prom\\", where Angel breaks up with her while they are patrolling Sunnydale sewers. * When Angel first returns to the office after becoming human, Cordelia worriedly demands, \\"Did you do it with Buffy?\\" And as Doyle steps up to stare into Angel's eyes she warns, \\"Watch it, Doyle. Don't get too close.\\" This is a reference to the events of the last half of season two of Buffy, beginning in \\"Surprise\\", when Angel's curse is broken by his moment of happiness with the Slayer, thus causing him to lose his soul and reverting him to the evil Angelus. * That much of Buffy's pleasure comes from her sense of being a \\"normal girl falling asleep in the arms of her normal boyfriend\\" underscores one of the Slayer's fundamental internal conflicts, which she first expresses to Giles in the Buffy premiere, \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", and essentially resolves in the series finale, \\"Chosen\\". * Buffy reminds Angel to include peanut butter in the supplies he grabs from the kitchen, recalling Angel's exasperation with Cordelia for getting peanut butter in his bed several weeks earlier, in \\"Rm w/a Vu\\". * Buffy's challenge to Mohra, \\"You hurt my boyfriend,\\" recalls her very similar challenge to Spike in the season two Buffy episode, \\"What's My Line, Part Two\\", after he abducts Angel as the blood sacrifice in his healing ritual for Drusilla: \\"You can hurt me, you can send assassins after me, but nobody messes with my boyfriend.\\" * When Buffy and Angel are approaching each other for their final embrace toward the end of the episode, the music starts to swell and it is noticed that the music is that of \\"Close Your Eyes,\\" the main theme heard in Season 2 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer during the finale, \\"Becoming: Part 2.\\" *This episode marks the final on screen meeting of Buffy and Cordelia, who have known each other since the events of the Buffy pilot episode \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\". Whereas both characters appear in the subsequent Angel episode \\"Sanctuary\\", they do not share any scenes. =Cultural references= * Titanic: Cordelia tells Doyle they have time for a cappuccino and, probably, the director's cut of Titanic while \\"The Buffy and Angel Show\\" runs its accustomed lengthy and dramatic course. * Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Before knowing the species of demon they pursue, Buffy refers to it as a Mutant Ninja Demon Thing, especially apt since they track it in the sewers. * Famille rose vase, Qing Dynasty c. 1811: Angel knows better than to show up a second time before The Oracles empty- handed. * Orson Welles: When Angel begins gorging on food, Doyle calls Angel \\"Orson\\" in reference to the director with a famous mid-life obesity.

It was won by David Rendel of the Liberal Democrats with a large swing of 28.4%, and well over twice as many votes as the Conservative candidate. As with the overwhelming majority of UK by- elections, turnout was lower than at the general election -- here falling from 83% to 71% (rounded). Background The by-election in Newbury was the first by-election of the 1992‚Äì1997 parliament, and the first in a string of by- election losses for the Conservative Party who were in their fourth consecutive term of office. Until 1993 the seat had been held by a Conservative MP since 1924. Candidates Many independent candidates, or candidates from newly formed or minor parties stood in the by-election, with three candidates standing on an anti-Maastricht Treaty platform. Andrew Bannon, a Labour member from Slough stood as a Conservative Candidate in protest at a Conservative member standing as a Labour Candidate in the 1992 general election in Slough. All candidates needed since 1985 to win at least 5% of the total votes to retain their deposit, which they must pay to stand for election. Every candidate apart from David Rendel and Julian Davidson lost their deposit, including Labour's Steve Billcliffe. The by-election achieved a record of 19 candidates, beating the previous high of seventeen at the 1984 Chesterfield by-election. It remained the longest ballot paper in any Parliamentary election until the 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election. Results Rendel served as MP until the 2005 general election, when he was defeated by the Conservative candidate Richard Benyon. General election result, 1992 This is the result of the 1992 general election in Newbury. Aftermath The loss of Newbury marked the beginning of a disastrous run of by-election defeats for John Major's Conservatives, as they went on to lose a further seven contests in seats they had held prior to the next general election in 1997. The result was later described by The Herald as \\"a major embarrassment for the Major Government\\", while Tim Farron would remember it as being \\"inspirational\\" for the Liberal Democrats.

Early life and education Fred DeLuca was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 3, 1947 to Italian American parents Carmela and Salvatore DeLuca. At the age of 10, DeLuca moved to Amsterdam, New York, where he and his family became friends with Peter Buck. Once in his teens, he moved with his family to Bridgeport, Connecticut. After succeeding in his business, DeLuca realized his dream to go to college and graduated from the University of Bridgeport. DeLuca was a 1965 graduate of Central High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Career In 1965, 17-year-old DeLuca borrowed $1,000 from family friend Dr. Peter Buck. This was after Buck suggested the idea to help DeLuca make money for college to study medicine. DeLuca's plan was to begin a \\"fast-food venture that provided a healthful, less fattening bill of fare\\". On the radio advertisement they had promoted the name as \\"Pete's Submarines,\\" which sounded like \\"Pizza Marines\\" (see mondegreen), so they changed the name to \\"Pete's Subway.\\" Eventually in 1968, it was shortened to simply \\"Subway\\" as it is known today. The first shop opened on August 28, 1965 at a mediocre location in the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The first year of business was a learning experience and a challenge. A year later they opened their second location, having realized that visibility and marketing were key factors to success. DeLuca believed that the biggest mistake he made was where he set up his very first shop as it was a \\"crummy location.\\" The third outlet was in a highly visible location and that location is still there today. In 1978, Subway's 100th store opened, and reached the 1,000 store mark in 1987. Explosive growth continued with Subway opening 1,100 units in 1993 alone. By comparison, McDonald's opened 800 that same year. As of April 2018, the company counts 43,700 franchised locations worldwide and this year plans to open more than 1,000 locations outside of North America, it produces US$9.05 billion in sales every year. In 2007, Forbes magazine named DeLuca number 242 of the 400 richest Americans with a net worth of $1.5 billion. Today, Subway is one of the most popular chain food vendors. DeLuca and Peter Buck also partnered to create Franchise Brands in an effort to assist other entrepreneurs in replicating their success in the franchise industry. Personal life DeLuca had homes in Milford, Connecticut, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and lived with his wife Elisabeth. His son, Jonathan, lives in Boca Raton, Florida. On July 15, 2013, DeLuca announced that he was being treated for leukemia. DeLuca died on September 14, 2015, at Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. Honors At the graduation commencement in 2002, DeLuca received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from his alma mater, the University of Bridgeport.

The first examples were discovered by Charles M. Sternberg in Alberta, Canada, in 1946, and named in 1950. Over a dozen partial skulls and a large assortment of other fossils from various species have been found in Alberta and Alaska. A great number were not available for study until the 1980s, resulting in a relatively recent increase of interest in Pachyrhinosaurus. Three species have been identified. P. lakustai, from the Wapiti Formation, the bonebed horizon of which is roughly equivalent age to the upper Bearpaw and lower Horseshoe Canyon Formations, is known to have existed from about 73.5‚Äì72.5 million years ago. P. canadensis is younger, known from the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation, about 71.5‚Äì71 Ma ago and the St. Mary River Formation. Fossils of the youngest species, P. perotorum, have been recovered from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska, and date to 70‚Äì69 Ma ago. The presence of three known species makes this genus the most speciose among the centrosaurines. Discovery and species P. canadensis skull cast, Geological Museum, Copenhagen Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis, was described in 1950 by Charles Mortram Sternberg based on the holotype incomplete skull NMC 8867, and the paratype incomplete skull NMC 8866, which included the anterior part of the skull but was lacking the right lower mandible, and the \\"beak\\". These skulls were collected in 1945 and 1946 from the sandy clay of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta, Canada. In the years to come, additional material would be recovered at the Scabby Butte locality of the St. Mary River Formation near Lethbridge, Alberta, from terrestrial sediments considered to be between 74 and 66 million years old. These were among the first dinosaur sites found in the province, in the 1880s. The significance of these discoveries was not understood until shortly after World War II when preliminary excavations were conducted. P. lakustai skull Another Pachyrhinosaurus skull was taken out of the Scabby Butte locality in 1955, and then in 1957 Wann Langston Jr. and a small crew excavated additional pachyrhinosaur remains. The University of Calgary has plans to reopen this important site some day as a field school for university-level paleontology students. Several specimens, NMC 21863, NMC 21864, NMC 10669 assigned in 1975 by W. Langston, Jr. to Pachyrhinosaurus were also recovered at the Scabby Butte locality. P. perotorum holotype Another Pachyrhinosaurus bonebed, on the Wapiti River south of Beaverlodge in northwestern Alberta, was worked briefly by staff of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in the late 1980s but is now worked annually for a couple weeks each summer (since 2006) by the University of Alberta. Material from this site appears referable to Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis. In 1974, Grande Prairie, Alberta science teacher Al Lakusta found a large bonebed along Pipestone Creek in Alberta. When the area was finally excavated between 1986 and 1989 by staff and volunteers of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, paleontologists discovered an amazingly large and dense selection of bones‚Äîup to 100 per square meter, with a total of 3,500 bones and 14 skulls. This was apparently the site of a mass mortality, perhaps a failed attempt to cross a river during a flood. Found amongst the fossils were the skeletons of four distinct age groups ranging from juveniles to full- grown dinosaurs, indicating that the Pachyrhinosaurus cared for their young. The adult skulls had both convex and concave bosses as well as unicorn-style horns on the parietal bone just behind their eyes. The concave boss types might be related to erosion only and not reflect male/female differences. In 2008, a detailed monograph describing the skull of the Pipestone Creek pachyrhinosaur, and penned by Philip J. Currie, Wann Langston Jr., and Darren Tanke, classified the specimen as a second species of Pachyrhinosaurus, named P. lakustai after its discoverer.Currie, P.J., Langston, W., and Tanke, D.H.

In 2013, Fiorillo et al. described a new specimen, an incomplete nasal bone attributable to Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum which was collected from the Kikak-Tegoseak Quarry on the Colville River in Alaska. Fiorillo et al. named this unique northern Alaskan species after the Texas oil billionaire and benefactor, Ross Perot. This bone, designated DMNH 21460 belongs to an immature individual. This discovery expands the known age profile of this dinosaur genus from this particular site. The specimen has nasal ornamentation that is dorsally enlarged, representing an intermediate stage of growth. Of note, the authors pointed out that the posterior part of the nasal shows evidence for \\"a degree of integument complexity not previously recognized in other species\\" of Pachyrhinosaurus. It was determined that the dorsal surface of the nasal boss bore a thick, cornified pad and sheath. Description Size comparison of P. canadensis The largest Pachyrhinosaurus species were long.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information It weighed about four tonnes. They were herbivorous and possessed strong cheek teeth to help them chew tough, fibrous plants. Restoration of two P. perotorum Instead of horns, their skulls bore massive, flattened bosses; a large boss over the nose and a smaller one over the eyes. A prominent pair of horns grew from the frill and extended upwards. The skull also bore several smaller horns or ornaments that varied between individuals and between species. In P. canadensis and P. perotorum, the bosses over the nose and eyes nearly grew together, and were separated only by a narrow groove. In P. lakustai, the two bosses were separated by a wide gap. In P. canadensis and P. lakustai, the frill bore two additional small, curved, backward-pointed horns. These were not present in P. perotorum, and in fact some specimens of P. lakustai also lack them, which may indicate that the presence of these horns varied by age or sex. Various ornaments of the nasal boss have also been used to distinguish between different species of Pachyrhinosaurus. Both P. lakustai and P. perotorum bore a jagged, comb-like extension at the tip of the boss which was missing in P. canadensis. P. perotorum was unique in having a narrow dome in the middle of the back portion of the nasal boss, and P. lakustai had a pommel-like structure projecting from the front of the boss (the boss of P. canadensis was mainly flat on top and rounded). P. perotorum bore two unique, flattened horns which projected forward and down from the top edge of the frill, and P. lakustai bore another comb-like horn arising from the middle of the frill behind the eyes. Classification TMP 2002.76.1, which may be a specimen of Pachyrhinosaurus, Achelousaurus, or a new taxon, in Royal Tyrrell Museum The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of all currently known Pachyrhinosaurus species following Chiba et al. (2017): Paleobiology = Growth rates = Skull differences between different growth stages of P. perotorum During the first few years of development, P. perotorum show extremely rapid growth. When the animals were one year old, they had already reached 28% of their adult body size. By age two, they were almost half the size of a mature adult. However, the rate of growth slows considerably after that, and maximum size is not fully attained until about age twenty. The development of characteristics useful in sexual selection, including competition between males, such as pronounced nasal bosses, occurred at approximately nine years of age. This presumably corresponds to the age of sexual maturity. Unlike other Pachyrhinosaurus species, P. perotorum shows highly conspicuous growth banding in the bones, indicating retarded growth during the winter. This is perhaps not surprising, considering that P. perotorum experienced much harsher winters than southerly species within the genus. P. lakustai does not show growth banding early in ontogeny in the specimens that have been examined. However, growth bands are weakly expressed later in ontogeny. This probably indicates rapid growth in youth, followed by gradually decreasing growth rates as the animal neared adulthood. The growth curve of the animal would therefore be somewhat asymptotic, unlike the linear growth found in many ectothermic animals. The development of characteristics useful in sexual selection, including competition between males, such as pronounced nasal bosses, occurred when the dinosaur was roughly 73% the size of a full-grown adult. The age of sexual maturity is unknown. Due to the lack of conspicuous growth banding, more detailed analyses of P. lakustai growth rates cannot be performed. Paleoecology = St. Mary River Formation=  Habitat  The St. Mary River Formation has not undergone a definitive radiometric dating, however, the available stratigraphic correlation has shown that this formation was deposited between 74 and 66 million years ago, during the Campanian and the late Maastrichtian, during the final regression of the mid-continental Bearpaw Seaway. It ranges from as far south as Glacier County, Montana to as far north as the Little Bow River in Alberta. The St. Mary River Formation is part of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in southwestern Alberta, which extends from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Canadian Shield in the east. It is laterally equivalent to the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The region where dinosaurs lived was bounded by mountains to the west, and included ancient channels, small freshwater ponds, streams, and floodplains.  Paleofauna  A herd of P. perotorum resting next to contemporaneous paleofauna from the Prince Creek Formation Pachyrhinosaurus shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as the ceratopsians Anchiceratops and Montanoceratops cerorhynchus, the armored nodosaur Edmontonia longiceps, the duckbilled hadrosaur Edmontosaurus regalis, the theropods Saurornitholestes and Troodon, possibly the ornithopod Thescelosaurus, and the tyrannosaurid Albertosaurus, which was likely the apex predator in its ecosystem. Vertebrates present in the St. Mary River Formation at the time of Pachyrhinosaurus included the actinopterygian fishes Amia fragosa, Lepisosteus, Belonostomus, Paralbula casei, and Platacodon nanus, the mosasaur Plioplatecarpus, the turtle Boremys and the diapsid reptile Champsosaurus. A fair number of mammals lived in this region, which included Turgidodon russelli, Cimolestes, Didelphodon, Leptalestes, Cimolodon nitidus, and Paracimexomys propriscus. Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included mollusks, the oyster Crassostrea wyomingensis, the small clam Anomia, and the snail Melania.Kososki, B., Reiser, H., Cavitt, C., Detterman, R (1978) A Gravity study of the northern part of the Arctic National Wildlife Range, Alaska.

It was deposited during the gradual withdrawal of the Western Interior Seaway, during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is a terrestrial unit which is part of the Edmonton Group that includes the Battle Formation and the Whitemud Member, both in Edmonton. The valley where dinosaurs lived included ancient meandering estuary channels, straight channels, peat swamps, river deltas, floodplains, shorelines and wetlands. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near- shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, and tidal flats. The area was wet and warm with a temperate to subtropical climate. Just prior to the Campanian‚ÄìMaastrichtian boundary, the mean annual temperature and precipitation in this region dropped rapidly. The dinosaurs from this formation form part of the Edmontonian land vertebrate age, and are distinct from those in the formations above and below. Modern life at high elevations in lower latitudes resembles life at low elevation in higher latitudes. There may be parallels to this phenomenon in Cretaceous ecosystems, for instance, Pachyrhinosaurus species are found in both Alaska and upland environments in southern Alberta.Lehman, T. M., 2001, Late Cretaceous dinosaur provinciality: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, pp. 310-328. During the Edmontonian, in North America's northern biome, there is a general trend of reduced centrosaurine diversity, with only Pachyrhinosaurus surviving. Pachyrhinosaurus appears to have been part of a coastal fauna characterized by an association with Edmontosaurus. Paleofauna Restoration of P. lakustai P. canadensis coexisted with ankylosaurids Anodontosaurus lambei and Edmontonia longiceps, the maniraptorans Atrociraptor marshalli, Epichirostenotes curriei, the troodontid Albertavenator curriei, the alvarezsaurid theropod Albertonykus borealis, the ornithomimids Dromiceiomimus brevitertius, Ornithomimus edmontonicus, and an unnamed species of Struthiomimus, the bone-head pachycephalosaurids Stegoceras, and Sphaerotholus edmontonensis, the ornithopod Parksosaurus warreni, the hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus regalis, Hypacrosaurus altispinus, and Saurolophus osborni, the ceratopsians Anchiceratops ornatus, Arrhinoceratops brachyops, Eotriceratops xerinsularis, Montanoceratops cerorhynchus, and the tyrannosaurids Albertosaurus sarcophagus and a possible species of Daspletosaurus, which were the apex predators of this paleoenvironment. Of these, the hadrosaurs dominated in terms of sheer number and made up half of all dinosaurs who lived in this region. Vertebrates present in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation at the time of Pachyrhinosaurus included reptiles, and amphibians. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Belonostomus made up the fish fauna. Reptiles such as turtles and crocodilians are rare in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and this was thought to reflect the relatively cool climate which prevailed at the time. A study by Quinney et al. (2013) however, showed that the decline in turtle diversity, which was previously attributed to climate, coincided instead with changes in soil drainage conditions, and was limited by aridity, landscape instability, and migratory barriers. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus was present and freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Evidence has shown that multituberculates and the early marsupial Didelphodon coyi were present. Vertebrate trace fossils from this region included the tracks of theropods, ceratopsians and ornithopods, which provide evidence that these animals were also present.Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. (2004) 861 pp. . Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included both marine and terrestrial invertebrates.

The rope dart can be used for twining, binding, circling, hitting, piercing, tightening, slashing and other techniques. Rope dart play consists of twining, shooting, and retrieval. Twining and shooting can be done from any joint such as foot, knee, elbow, and neck. The rope is anchored on one hand and played primarily with the other hand. Skillful use of the rope dart can easily trick an opponent because the dart can shoot out very suddenly, from a person beyond immediate reach. Just like the chain whip, excellent hand-eye coordination is a must for the practitioner to use this weapon well. In some Wushu training regimens, the chain whip and Changquan are prerequisites for learning the rope dart. A variation of this weapon is the meteor hammer, which has a blunt weight on the end of the rope. It was used in a similar fashion to the rope dart, and many of the techniques are the same. History The first written description of the rope dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907 AD). Construction The rope dart is constructed from 4 to 5 parts: * dart * rings * rope or fine chain * flags or bright feathers * handle (optional) The dart is made of a hard material, usually iron or steel. It can be of variable weight depending on the users preference, and can be variable in shape (conical, triangular prism, pentagonal prism). The rings (usually 4 or 5) are attached to the dart head. The rope is attached to the final ring. Traditionally, the rope was constructed from Chinese rope and covered with wax to minimize friction. In modern times, the rope is often made of a softer synthetic material and covered with talc powder or some other substance to reduce friction. There is at least one flag attached near, or onto the dart head itself to conceal the dart during play and to add control. Additional flags can be attached to the side rings to slow down the dart and increase control. The handle is made from the last piece of rope as a slipknot to attach to the anchor hand's wrist. As performance art While relatively new, rope dart is becoming increasingly popular in being used in the object manipulation scene due to its impressive performances. Because of this, there have been modifications to the original design. Some rope darts have been created to be set alight. A section of fireproof chain between the dart or meteor head and the rope attaches it securely and Kevlar wicks form the flammable head. Other rope darts have heads filled with LED lights. Both of these can be performed in the dark, adding excitement and mystery.

Life Ventura was born in Finale Emilia in the Duchy of Modena to a Jewish father (and a catholic mother, Vittoria Massarani) and received a conventional Jewish education. At the age of seventeen, Ventura enrolled as a volunteer in the militia of the Kingdom of Italy and later served with Napoleon's imperial army in the Queens's Dragons. After the Battle of Waterloo and Napoleon's, he returned home. In 1817, his revolutionary and Napoleonic sympathies became known to the local authorities following a dispute between him and a member of the reactionary Ducal police. As such, he was obliged to leave the country. He went first to Trieste, and then to Constantinople, where he was for a time a ship-broker. Learning that Persia was seeking the services of European soldiers, he obtained an officer's commission and helped to instruct the forces of the shah in European methods of warfare, soon becoming a colonel. Upon the death of the shah in 1822, Ventura offered his services to his successor, Abbas Mirza. In the latter's service, however, were a number of English officers who were decidedly hostile to the French; they considered Ventura to be French because he had fought under Napoleon. As a result of their political intrigues, Ventura was dismissed. He travelled east, ending in Lahore with Jean-Fran√ßois Allard in 1822. They took service with the Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab. In March the following year, they both held command in the Battle of Nowshera, where they defeated a combined Afghan force, resulting in Punjab's capture of Peshawar. A rebellion having arisen in Afghanistan, Ventura conducted successfully several campaigns of a difficult nature, and greatly enlarged the boundaries of the kingdom of Lahore. Together with Allard, Paolo Di Avitabile, and Claude August Court, Ventura formed the group of European mercenary officers responsible for the modernisation of the Sikh army. He also took responsibility for the training and command of the Fauj-i- Khas, the European model brigade. Ventura \\"reorganised the infantry into a formidable army including Gurkhas, Pathans, Biharis and Ooriyas.\\"Major Pearse, Hugh; Ranjit Singh and his white officers. In He is also described as \\"the baron of the Fauj-i-Khas\\". The Maharaja not only promoted Ventura to the rank of General, but also appointed him kazi and Governor of Lahore. He rose rapidly in the Darbar and virtually became the Commander in Chief of the Darbar forces. Ventura married an Indian (or a local Armenian according other sources) lady, with whom he had a daughter, but he always longed to return to his native country. In 1837 he went on a diplomatic mission to Paris and London, but was recalled to Lahore before he had time to visit his family. Sketch from Charles Grey's European Adventurers of Northern India (Lahore: 1929) He spent his spare time in Peshawar exhuming Bactrian Greek and Kushan coins from Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas in the Khyber Pass, making numerous excavations then sending the findings on to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta. He served faithfully under Ranjit Singh and his successors Kharak Singh, Nau Nihal Singh, and Sher Singh. Upon Maharaja Sher Si·πÖgh's assassination in September 1843, he left the Punjab. In France, he presented King Louis Philippe with a set of ancient Greek coins which he had unearthed. These coins were taken as evidence of Alexander the Great's march through Afghanistan and the Sindh-Punjab region of ancient India. In his later years he lost a part of his large fortune in unsuccessful commercial enterprises. According to Flaminio Servi, Ventura received baptism toward the end of his life.VENTURA, RUBINO on \\"Jewish Encyclopedia\\" He died on 3 April 1858 in Lardenne, near Toulouse, France.

It is very rare on the Earth's surface, however, it may be a predominant form of silicon dioxide in the Earth, especially in the lower mantle.Dmitry L. Lakshtanov et al. \\"The post-stishovite phase transition in hydrous alumina-bearing SiO2 in the lower mantle of the earth\\" PNAS 2007 104 (34) 13588-13590; . Stishovite was named after Sergey M. Stishov, a Russian high-pressure physicist who first synthesized the mineral in 1961. It was discovered in Meteor Crater in 1962 by Edward C. T. Chao. Unlike other silica polymorphs, the crystal structure of stishovite resembles that of rutile (TiO2). The silicon in stishovite adopts an octahedral coordination geometry, being bound to six oxides. Similarly, the oxides are three-connected, unlike low-pressure forms of SiO2. In most silicates, silicon is tetrahedral, being bound to four oxides. It was long considered the hardest known oxide (~30 GPa Vickers); however, boron suboxide has been discovered in 2002 to be much harder. At normal temperature and pressure, stishovite is metastable. Stishovite can be separated from quartz by applying hydrogen fluoride (HF); unlike quartz, stishovite will not react. Appearance Large natural crystals of stishovite are extremely rare and are usually found as clasts of 1 to 2 mm in length. When found, they can be difficult to distinguish from regular quartz without laboratory analysis. It has a vitreous luster, is transparent (or translucent), and is extremely hard. Stishovite usually sits as small rounded gravels in a matrix of other minerals. Synthesis Until recently, the only known occurrences of stishovite in nature formed at the very high shock pressures (>100 kbar, or 10 GPa) and temperatures (> 1200 ¬∞C) present during hypervelocity meteorite impact into quartz-bearing rock. Minute amounts of stishovite have been found within diamonds, and post-stishovite phases were identified within ultra-high-pressure mantle rocks. Stishovite may also be synthesized by duplicating these conditions in the laboratory, either isostatically or through shock (see shocked quartz). At 4.287 g/cm3 it is second densest polymorph of silica, after seifertite. It has tetragonal crystal symmetry, P42/mnm, No. 136, Pearson symbol tP6.

It bisects the country almost evenly between east and west. In the north, it starts at the border with Denmark as an extension of the Danish part of E45. In the south, the autobahn ends at the Austrian border. This final gap was closed in September 2009.  Overview  BAB 7 approaching Hamburg The Bundesautobahn 7 starts at Flensburg and travels through the two states at Schleswig and Rendsburg, through the world's busiest artificial waterway of Kiel Canal crossing the Rader high bridge. At Rendsburg you can change to the A 210, a feeder to the Schleswig-Holstein capital, Kiel. A few kilometers further south there is another feeder route to Kiel, the A 215, into the A7 at the interchange Bordesholm. However, this can only be reached from the south, likewise from the A 215 you can only reach the A7 in the south. South of Bordesholm, the highway has been continuously expanded to six lanes since 2014 due to the high traffic volume to Hamburg. Since 2016 and 2017, several sections have six lanes. Here, the motorway leads past the cities of Neum√ºnster, Bad Bramstedt and Norderstedt, before the hamlet of Schnelsen reaches Hamburg's urban area, and also Hamburg Airport. From the intersection Hamburg-Nordwest, where the A23 branches off towards Heide, the A7 is six lanes, but is currently being expanded to eight lanes. The section through the Hamburg city is characterized by an immense volume of traffic, congestion is the order of the day here. There are several reasons for this: the motorway runs through inner-city areas, there is a lot of holiday traffic on the route during school holidays, there are practically no opportunities for bypassing, the speed is permanently limited to 80 km / h as an urban area and the section is extended, South of the equipped with four tubes to two lanes Elbe tunnel leads the A7 on the highway Elbmarsch, the longest road bridge in Germany, right through the harbor area and the Harburg mountains to Lower Saxony. Via the corner junction A 261 you get to the A 1 to Bremen, at the following Maschener Kreuz on the A 39 to L√ºneburg. Going through the Hannover from Hamburg, the highway has six lanes, and it was downgraded to the four-lane section between Soltau and Walsrode the hard shoulder can be temporarily released as a third lane. It leads across the L√ºneburg Heath, partly with separate directional lanes. At the triangle Walsrode you reach the A 27 to Bremen and a few kilometers to the south, before reaching the capital of Lower Saxony, at the junction Hannover-Nord on the A 352, which connects the airport Hannover and ends at the A 2, which leads to Dortmund. The following motorway junctions of the A7 provide a connection to the A37 Hanover city center and to Celle or A 2 Ruhrgebiet-Berlin dar. By the Altwarmb√ºchener Moor the highway leads east to Hanover; at the triangle Hannover-S√ºd, where the southern branch of the A 37 to the fair Hanover is connected only with the further south part of the A7. South of Hildesheim, the A7 enters the low mountain range, the landscape becomes hilly. The Salzgitter triangle also connects only the southern part of the A7 with the A 39 to Braunschweig and Salzgitter. Between the triangle Salzgitter and G√∂ttingen the highway is expanded six-lane. Passing the university town, the A 38 branches off at Dreieck Drammetal to Leipzig. Then the A7 leads over steep gradients and slopes into the Werratal near Hann. M√ºnden and you are in Hesse. At Kassel, it is the largest district, from there you can get on the A44 in the direction of the west to the Ruhr area and in some years, when the extension Kassel- Herleshausen will be completed, also in the direction of Eisenach. Between the interchange Kassel-Ost and the interchange Kassel-S√ºd, the A7 is being developed eight-lane for a future convergence with the then branching off to the east A44. In Kassel, the unfinished A 49 branches off, which will lead from completed completion to the Ohmtal triangle, which is to be built near Homberg (Ohm) between the junctions Alsfeld-West and Homberg (Ohm) on the A5. Between Kassel and Kirchheim the Kn√ºllgebirge is crossed. The Kirchheim triangle and the Hattenbacher triangle, which are close to each other and quite close to the geographic center of Germany, together form one of the most important motorway junctions of the state. The A 4 leads to the New L√§nder and Eastern Europe, the A 5 to the Rhine-Main area and on to the border of Switzerland. South of the Hattenbacher triangle is the A7 sections four-lane expanded, leads past Fulda, where the A 66 branches off to Hanau and reaches Bavarian territory. Crossing the Rh√∂n, pass Schweinfurt (cross with the A 70 to Bayreuth) and W√ºrzburg to the Biebelried intersection, where the A 3 Ruhrgebiet-Frankfurt am Main-N√ºrnberg-Passau is crossed. Here was the southern end of the A7 for a long time. The completion of the south in the 1980s leads past Rothenburg ob der Tauber on the western edge of the Frankenh√∂he to the freeway junction Feuchtwangen / Crailsheim (intersection with the A 6 Saarbr√ºcken-Heilbronn-Nuremberg- Waidhaus) and partly Baden-W√ºrttemberg area over the Ostalb, for the crossing even two tunnels had to be built, via Aalen to Ulm. At the motorway junction Ulm / Elchingen, the A8 (Luxembourg- Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Munich-Salzburg) is crossed. South of Ulm it goes through the Illertal parallel to the river back to Bavaria, via Memmingen (cross with the A 96 Lindau Munich) and Kempten (branch to the A 980 to Oberstdorf), over the 2009 completed section through the Reinertshoftunnel to the edge of the foot of the Alps. There, the lane becomes one lane and flows into the border tunnel F√ºssen to Austria.  History  The expressway near F√ºssen The highway replaced as a trunk connection the imperial or federal roads 76, 77, 205 and 4 (Flensburg-Hamburg), 3 (Hamburg-Kassel) and 27 (G√∂ttingen-W√ºrzburg), which in turn went back to medieval precursors. On the route between Flensburg and Hamburg, for example, it follows the historic Ochsenweg and can be described as its successor in terms of its importance as a trade route from Scandinavia to the south. Plans for a highway from Hamburg to the south were made in the framework of the HaFraBa from 1926. This project is considered to be the predecessor of the A7 between Hamburg and the Hattenbacher Dreieck. The first section opened from G√∂ttingen to Bad Hersfeld in 1937. Construction of the section between Bad Hersfeld and W√ºrzburg (Strecke 46) began in 1937 with various bridge structures built however the road wasn't completed before war broke out in 1939 and construction was stopped before being fully abandon in 1940. After World War 2 the route of A7 was altered leaving some of the abandoned bridge structures of Strecke 46 to be preserved as historic monuments. From the 1950s, the highway was built between the A 1 south of Hamburg and the existing part of the A7 near G√∂ttingen and opened in sections. At the A1 the \\"Horster triangle\\" was created as the new beginning of the A7. From the south (Hanover) coming vehicles had there at the threading to the A1 in the direction of west (Bremen) drive through a steep curve for many years. The section Echte-Seesen was opened on 14 November 1959. The section Seesen Hildesheim was opened on 15 December 1960 by Secretary of Transportation Seebohm. From 1956, the seven sections between Hamburg and Hanover were handed over to traffic. In 1960, the 21km section between junction Berkhof and the cross Hannover / Kirchhorst was opened last. The four remaining sections in between were opened in 1958. The gap closure was achieved with the 35 km section between motorway junction Hannover / Kirchhorst and junction Hildesheim in 1962. In the 1960s, the A7 was then built on a slightly different route. The first to be opened in 1965 was the 10.9 km section north of the Biebelried interchange to the junction W√ºrzburg / Estenfeld. 1966 followed the adjacent section to the present cross Schweinfurt / Werneck and the 14.8 km long section between Fulda North and Fulda South. The northernmost section from the Hattenbacher Triangle to Fulda (32 km) and the middle section between Fulda and Schweinfurt (68 km) were finally handed over to traffic in 1968. In the 1960s and 1970s, the highway was built in the Hamburg area and the so-called north axis to Denmark and handed over to traffic. The construction took place in nine sections. An important milestone was the opening of the New Elbe Tunnel in 1975. On 13 July 1976, Ernst Haar, Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport, and Schleswig-Holstein's Minister of the Interior Rudolf Titzck solemnly opened the motorway section from Tarp to Handewitt. Only in 1978, the last vacant space between Tarp and Schuby was closed, so that the highway could be driven from Hamburg to the federal border. On 13 June 1978, Queen Margrethe II and President Walter Scheel opened the border crossing Ellund, accompanied by Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and the Flensburg Mayor Ingrid Gross. At 10.55 clock they officially released the freeway and passport control, at 12.32 clock rolled the first car through the new border crossing. Ellund developed into the most important transit point of German-Danish border traffic. In 1979, 3.2 million travelers passed the counters; until 1997, the number had more than quintupled at 16.7 million. In the preliminary draft for a motor vehicle road network of Germany of the study company for automotive road construction (STUFA) of 1926 a highway W√ºrzburg-Ulm-Lindau was provided, detail planning took place from 1935 to 1941. In 1969, the states of Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg were able to agree on a line parallel to the federal highway 19. From 1972 first sections could be released. It started with the Berkheim section to junction Memmingen-S√ºd (9.4 km) and the first 27.1 km long directional lane between Bad Gr√∂nenbach and Kempten-Leubas. Major sections were between Kreuz Biebelried and junction Uffenheim-Langensteinach (34.7 km) in 1980, the southern extension to the junction Feuchtwangen (42.1 km) in 1985 and further to the junction Heidenheim (59.6 km) opened in 1987. Since the last 6.8 kilometers to the junction Oy-Mittelberg were already released a year ago, the highway was already passable from Denmark to the Allg√§u. In 1992, the A7 was extended by another 4.9 km to Nesselwang. A few meters west of the junction of the same name is the highest motorway point in Germany: \\"914.081 m above sea level. NN \\". In July 1999, the opening of the border tunnel F√ºssen to Tyrol followed with a tube and two lanes. The tunnel is supposed to relieve the surrounding communities of the high traffic volume during vacation time. In 2005, the northern adjoining first directional lane was opened up to the county road at Gunzenberg. Until September 2009, traffic from the end of the motorway at Nesselwang was routed via various routes for cars and trucks to the border tunnel, which often led to traffic jams. On 1 September 2009 was the official inauguration of the last 15-kilometer section, which was released more than a year late. The viaduct Enzenstetten was initially only one-way passable, as the construction-performing consortium could not complete it on time. The second half of the bridge went into operation in December 2010, to the Austrian border.  Recent Changes  The highway is from the Danish border to the Bordesholmer triangle with the A 215 four-lane expanded. To triangle Hamburg northwest with the A 23 are several sections since 2016/2017 six-lane, the remaining four-lobed sections are expected to end of 2019 six lanes expanded. It follows a six-lane section to the junction Hamburg- Bahrenfeld. Thereafter, eight lanes will be available in the Elbtunnels area. In the further course there are again six lanes, between the triangle Hamburg- southwest (A 261) and the Horster triangle (A 1) only four. Between Hamburg and Hildesheim, the motorway has six lanes, with the exception of the four- lane section between the Soltau-Ost junction and the Walsrode junction (A 27). In this four-lane section can be released with a traffic control system as needed both hard shoulder as each third lane. In this area, the highway was in early 2009 despite the heavy traffic largely from only four lanes. Only in a few gradient areas there was an additional third lane available. By the end of 2016, several sections were expanded. About half of the road is widened to six lanes. Between N√∂rten-Hardenberg and the Hattenbacher Dreieck, the highway is consistently expanded to six-lane. South of Kassel, as well as between the Kirchheim triangle and the Hattenbacher triangle, there is an additional fourth lane on inclines in the direction of south. Because of the steep climbs and gradients, the section is known as the Kassel mountains and is considered by motorists to be particularly demanding for trucks and caravans. Throughout the southern section, the A7 is four lanes. Only a few sections have more than two strips per directional lane. The highway ends since 1 September 2009 at the border tunnel F√ºssen. This contains only one tube with one lane per direction. In the area of the valley bridge Enzenstetten the A7 was only two- lane drivable until the completion of the second bridge in December 2010.  Under Construction  The A7 is being upgraded from the Bordesholm motorway intersection to the Hamburg Northwest motorway junction on 65 kilometers from four to six lanes. This measure will be realized through a public-private partnership and should cost a total of 600 million euros. The official starting signal for the major project in Schleswig-Holstein was on 1 September 2014. Already in May, preparations were started, especially in Hamburg. The expansion should take place until 2018. On 16 December 2016, Prime Minister Albig released the first section of the 6-lane A7 between the Bordesholm motorway junction and the AS Neum√ºnster-Nord interchange. It has been agreed that the operating company will carry out the remaining work on the six- kilometer stretch between Neum√ºnster and Bordesholm and then transfer it to the state of Schleswig-Holstein. The other 59 kilometers operates and receives the company until 2044. Since March, a 9.9-kilometer section at Gro√üenaspe is six-lane expanded. On 7 April 2017, another expanded section was released by Prime Minister Albig. It is about 10 kilometers between the junctions Kaltenkirchen and Quickborn. At the end of the decade the realization of the project can be expected. As part of the widening works, the A7 north of the Elbtunnel three covers of the highway are provided in Schnelsen, Stellingen, Othmarschen and Bahrenfeld. The allotments that have existed in the area for 90 years are to be \\"relocated\\" to these and thus ensure that the districts separated by the motorway grow together again. In addition to 25 hectares of green space and 3000 apartments to be created. The plan approval decision for the six-lane expansion between the triangle Hamburg-Nordwest and Schnelsen was made on 15 December 2012. After the end of the current construction measures, the lids should have a total length of 3.8 kilometers. In addition to 240 million euros from the federal government, 160 to 240 million euros will go to the city of Hamburg for noise control measures. In the further demand with planning right the six-lane development of the A7 over the connection point Soltau-Ost was planned up to the triangle Walsrode. On 30 March 2012, the federal government began planning for the six-lane expansion. The expansion is divided into three sections: triangle Walsrode to Bad Fallingbostel, Bad Fallingbostel to Dorfmark and Dorfmark to Soltau-Ost. For the section triangle Walsrode to Bad Fallingbostel, the plan approval decision was issued on 4 August 2015. Since the end of October there is building law for this section. 58 million euros were released in December 2015. Construction work began in early 2016 and construction began in August 2016. Construction of this section is expected to be ready in 2019. For the other two sections the design planning is running. The six-lane widening of the sections from Soltau-Ost to Fallingbostel has been classified as an urgent need since 2016. The further eight-lane expansion to the triangle Hannover-Nord is only in the further need. On 29 January 2016, the planning approval procedure was initiated to expand the tank and rest area Allertal and to build the Allertal junction. The short four-lane section to the north of the Salzgitter triangle with the A 39 was upgraded to a priority requirement in 2016 with the amendment of the Fernstra√üenausbaugesetz - bottleneck elimination. The continuation to G√∂ttingen is unannounced plan-established, with the exception of the sections between Seesen and N√∂rten-Hardenberg already finished six-lane expansion and is in the status of ongoing and firmly scheduled in the highway development law. From June 2012 to June 2013, a public-private partnership (PPP) was examined for the extension of the line between Seesen and N√∂rten-Hardenberg. According to this audit report of the Federal Court of Auditors, the expansion would not be cheaper in a PPP, but by 12.8 million euros more expensive. The project was awarded with the contract beginning 1 May 2017 to the consortium Via Niedersachsen with the shareholders VINCI Concessions Deutschland GmbH and Meridiam Investments. On 26 August 2015, the planning approval procedure was initiated for the conversion and expansion of the tank and service facility G√∂ttingen with the construction of the Rosdorf exit. The section between the future triangle Kassel-Ost and the triangle Kassel-S√ºd is under construction into eight lanes, since the total traffic of the A7 and the A44 shares this route. Construction began in fall 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2022. First, the noise protection is expanded. The additional lanes are created by making lanes and median strips narrower. In the course of the expansion, the refueling and rest area Kassel (-West and -Ost) was dismantled and rebuilt at the location of the Rastanlage Kassel-Ost between 2016 and 2018. In planning stages The A20 is to be connected at the level Bad Bramstedt via a motorway junction to the A7. At the south of the Hamburg Elbe Tunnel, the highway to the planned motorway junction Hamburg-S√ºderelbe with the federal highway 26 is eight stripe to be expanded. This should be implemented by 2022. Current plans of the Federal Ministry of Transport provide an intersection of the A26 at the future motorway intersection Hamburg-S√ºderelbe south of the Elbe, where it will continue east through Wilhelmsburg as a so-called port passage to A1 with a motorway junction Hamburg-Stillhorn. In May 2011, funding was approved by the Federal Ministry of Transport. To the east of W√ºrzburg, between Kreuz Schweinfurt / Werneck and Kreuz Biebelried an expansion to six strips in the further need with planning right classified. On 15 June 2016, during the construction of the Schraudenbach valley bridge near Schraudenbach, the shoring collapsed during the concreting of a superstructure section. The accident cost the life of a construction worker. In addition, there were 14 life-threatening injuries. The six-lane widening of the A7 in the section between the AD Hittistetten and the AS Illertissen was included in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030 and the Highway Act as urgent needs, the further expansion to the junction Memmingen-South is added as a further need with planning law.  Strecke 46  Through the Rh√∂n Mountains and Spessart, where the autobahn was known as Strecke 46 (Route 46), some bridges were built as early as 1937, but construction was halted in October 1939 by World War II. In 1954, the Strecke 46 route was abandoned and the final stretch of the A 7 in this area was later built on a slightly different route and finally completed in 1968. The remains of Strecke 46 have been classified as a listed building in 2003 by the government of Bavaria.

It is the second tallest building in Frankfurt, the second tallest building in Germany and the second tallest building in the European Union. It was the tallest building in Europe from its completion in 1991 until 1997 when it was surpassed by the Commerzbank Tower, which is also located in Frankfurt. The Messeturm is the 17th tallest building in Europe and the 413th tallest in the world. The Messeturm is located near the Frankfurt Trade Fair grounds. Helmut Jahn designed the Messeturm in a postmodern architectural style. It is regarded as one of the design classics among European skyscrapers. Despite its name, the Messeturm is not used for trade fair exhibitions but as an office building. It is one of the few buildings in Germany with their own postal code (60308), the others being Opernturm, another Frankfurt skyscraper, and the summit station on Zugspitze.  Design  The Messeturm is similar in design to towers by other architects including the Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia and Key Tower (1991) in Cleveland, Ohio. Frankfurters often call it Bleistift (\\"pencil\\") due to its shape. The construction of the building's foundation set a world record for the longest continuous concrete pour. Ninety trucks poured concrete for 78 hours into the deep foundation. Its ground floor area is just , and features a pyramid at the top. The tower uses numerous geometric shapes in its design such as the square footprint which is the main shape used throughout the tower. It then rises to a cylindrical shape which finally completes in a pyramid, probably as expression of the masonry.

History Mawanella is historically famous for Uthuwan Kande Soora Saradiel - a native who fought against British colonialism. He is known as the Robin Hood of Ceylon/ Sri Lanka as he looted the wealth from British officers and their local counterparts only to distribute it among the poor villagers. Deekirikewagela Saradiel was born in 1832 to his father Deekirikewage Adasi Appu - a bullocart driver and Molligoda Pichohami - a small coffee shop owner. The natives were under heavy economical and political pressure from unfair taxes under British rule and were rebelling against as best way they could. Saradiel was accompanied by fellow natives namely Mammale Marikkar, Baya, Hawadiya, Samat etc. In order to evade his arrest, Saradiel, decided not to remain in one single place permanently, for the sake of his own safety. While he was thus taking refuge in the homes of his friends, on March 17, 1864, a police team under the command of Head Constable Amath surrounded the house where Saradiel had been hiding, with the help of some of the residents of that area who had given them the tip-off, which resulted in the death on the spot of George Van Haught, a member of the police search party, due to a gunshot wound. Also, while Muttusamy and Christian Appu, two of his other accomplices received grievous injuries and two other were slightly injured, while they were thus engaged in the fracas, Saradiel and Mammale Marikkar succeeded in escaping. Subsequently, the Police team including Police Sergeant Mahath and Police Constable Sabab, set out on March 21, 1864 to arrest Saradiel on the information given by the informant, one Sirimala. Based on this information, when the Police team surrounded the house belonging to Abdul Cader of Mawenelle searching for Saradiel, he attempted to shoot Sergeant Mahath. But Sergeant Mahath outsmarted Saradiel by shooting him first, which resulted in Saradiel falling to the ground from the upstairs where he had been hiding. Due to a gunshot fired from the upstairs by Mammale Marikkar, a member of Saradiel‚Äôs gang, the Police Constable Saban was killed. This was the first time ever a police officer died on duty in Sri Lankan Police history and since, March 21 is commemorated as the Police Day. Saradiel was later executed by the British after a short trial.

During this time, Jackson and many of the other actors on the show were paid minimum scale (wage) despite the show's growing success. Tension grew between the producers (Barrie Dunn and Mike Volpe) and Jackson due to working conditions and creative disagreements. Jackson gave notice that he would leave the show after season 6, as he was close friends with the series' creator Mike Clattenburg. Although Jackson had one more season to fulfill on his contract, no legal action was taken against him. The producers and writers did not directly address the issue of Cory and Trevor leaving the show at the end of season 6, even though they knew of their impending departure for some time beforehand. Their departure from Sunnyvale was addressed in season 7 and their names have been part of the continuing storyline. Cory Bowles returned for Season 8 as part of the show's Netflix reboot and has since appeared in each following season, with Jacob Rolfe's Jacob Collins character filling Jackson's role as Cory's sidekick, as Jackson declined to return to the show. In season eight, Cory explained that he and Trevor were exploring the world, but got separated on a subway train in New York City. In season 10, Bowles is credited as a director on some episodes.

History  Aqueduct in Serpa Castle of Serpa Serpa has its origins in early settlement that preceded the Roman occupation of the Iberian peninsula. The neighbouring town of Beja (known as Pax Julia by the Romans) became the capital of southern Lusitanian (Pacensis). Serpa grew through the settlement of Roman colonists, with proof coming from various archaeological remains within the Roman villa. Moorish settlement followed this period, and remained until the Reconquista (the Christian re-conquest of Iberia). As a result of Serpa's proximity to the Spanish border, the town has always been a defensive stronghold. In the 13th century, owing to its location on the left bank of the Guadiana, it was occupied by forces loyal to Castile. On 1281, King D. Alfonso X of Castile delimited the municipality, attributing a Foral (charter) to the town, from Seville, in order to encourage settlement and expansion. Following the Reconquista, in 1295, Serpa received a new foral from Portuguese King D. Dinis. The local keep that dominated Serpa was partly damaged as a result of the last Spanish invasion. At that time, the king ordered the re-construction of the castle, as well as the erection of a wall fortification. A new foral was issued in 1513, by King D. Manuel I, who was the former master of Serpa. During the 17th century, the walls and system of bastions were adapted to serve as a defensive line by Nicolau de Langres (1665). On 30 January 1954, the walls of Serpa were classified as a Monumento Nacional (National Monument). Following the Carnation Revolution (in 1974), the Portuguese Communist Party gained strong support in the area, where it continues to be popular. On 26 August 2003, the town of Serpa was elevated to city status. Meanwhile, on 28 January 2013, the historic centre of Serpa (that included the principal civil parishes) of S√£o Salvador and Santa Maria, was re-incorporated into a single civil parish (Decree 11-A/2013, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1, 19).  Geography  A view of the Guadiana River within the territory of Serpa Administratively, the municipality is divided into five civil parishes: * Brinches * Pias * Serpa (Salvador e Santa Maria) * Vila Nova de S√£o Bento e Vale de Vargo * Vila Verde de Ficalho  Economy  A view of the Serpa solar power plant The area surrounding Serpa consists mostly of farms and cultivated lands of wheat, that have traditionally been the staple of the local economy, employing many people. Due to the area's strong agricultural reliance, the local population has traditionally been agrarian farmers and sheepherders. This has also resulted in the production of its spicy and strong-smelling cheeses, produced in the area and commercialized throughout Portugal. Slightly to the northeast, in the region of Pias, the area cultivates vineyards in order to produce local wines. On 27 April 2006, GE Energy Financial Services, PowerLight Corporation and Catavento Lda. announced that they would build one of the world's largest solar photovoltaic power projects at a single site in Serpa. The 11-megawatt solar power station, comprising 52,000 photovoltaic modules, would be built in one of Europe's sunniest areas. The power station was inaugurated on 28 March 2007.  Culture  Urban residents of Lisbon, Beja and other cities maintain country homes in Serpa, or take weekend breaks to the area as a result of Serpa's rural location and laid back lifestyle. Other local and regional specialties include Shepherd's Lamb Stew, a Clam and Pork dish and Sweet Potato Pastries.
