Mount Davis, or Mt. Davis, is a section of 20,000 capacity seating at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, United States. It was built in 1995 at the behest of Oakland City Council with the intent of bringing the Los Angeles Raiders American football team back to Oakland and is named after former Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis. Since 2006, the top-tier seating of Mount Davis has been covered by tarpaulin during all Oakland Athletics baseball games, and the Oakland Raiders followed suit in 2013.  History  In 1982, the Oakland Raiders left Oakland because of the city's refusal to upgrade the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, leaving the Oakland Athletics baseball team as the sole tenants. Previously, the team had to contend with two setups in the same stadium within a season before the move to Los Angeles and in 1995; in baseball season, they played in an alternate home plate-to-centerfield configuration when the two teams were in season, while then maintaining a large section of portable bleachers to provide northeast sideline seating after the A's season ended, meaning season ticket holders had to contend with two different seating assignments, even in the main seating bowl. The former seating arrangement could consist of half the Raiders' home games if the A's advanced to the World Series, well into October. In 1995, the city made an agreement with Raiders owner Al Davis that they would increase the capacity of the Coliseum in exchange for him bringing the Raiders back to Oakland. The result was a structure that became known as Mount Davis after Davis. There was criticism when Mount Davis was built as it obstructed views of the Oakland Hills. It was completed in 1996 but was criticized for being too steep and taking spectators too far away from the field of play. It had been noted to negatively affect baseball as while it provided a shield against the sun for outfielders chasing fly balls, it was an enclosed concrete stadium and had lost capacity for the Athletics. Mount Davis cost approximately $500 million to build, with the cost shared by Alameda County and the city of Oakland. From then it cost the county and the city a shared $20 million a year in debt repayments, which had the side effect of the city having to lay off police officers. In 2015, Alameda County paid off the remaining $100 million of debt from its own surplus reserves, arranging for the city to continue annual payments to the county on its share of the $100 million.  Tarpaulin  The tarp on the main grandstand; this section of tarp was removed in 2017, but the tarp on Mount Davis remains Oakland Coliseum's Mount Davis with fans seated there during a Bay Bridge Series game between the Athletics and Giants on August 24, 2019. Owing to low attendance, in 2006 the Oakland Athletics installed a layer of tarpaulin (tarp) covering all top-tier seating areas of the Coliseum, including the top level of Mount Davis. As the Athletics could not sell advertising space on the tarp due to city regulations, various Athletics-related messages were printed instead on the tarp; the Mount Davis sections of tarp display the team's logo and retired numbers. The covered seats numbered 20,878, representing approximately 37% of seating capacity in the Coliseum. Though the tarp can be removed, the Athletics management previously refused to do so unless the team made the World Series, as they claimed it made the stadium more \\"intimate\\". This policy was maintained to the chagrin of many fans during the 2012 American League Division Series where all other seats were sold out with demand for more tickets but the tarp was not removed. For the 2013 American League Division Series, the tarp was removed from the rest of the third deck, but not Mount Davis. However, in 2017, Athletics president Dave Kaval announced that some sections of tarp - though not those on Mount Davis - would be removed for at least the remainder of the 2017 season. Done in response to the long-standing fan complaints, this move added back 12,103 seats to the Coliseum during Athletics games, leaving the 8,775 seats on Mount Davis still covered. In 2013, the Oakland Raiders also started covering Mount Davis with tarp owing to the National Football League television blackout policies which obligate teams to black out the game if they cannot sell more than 85% stadium capacity. Over the previous few years, the Raiders had been forced to black out more home games than were televised. This had the effect of making the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum the smallest stadium in the National Football League. Under NFL rules, Mount Davis had to remain tarped all season long, no matter if they made the NFL playoffs or not. The Raiders kept Mount Davis tarped from 2013 until the team moved to Las Vegas in 2020. On July 21, 2018, the tarp on Mount Davis was removed for an interleague matchup against the Bay Bridge rival San Francisco Giants in a successful attempt to break a Coliseum attendance record. Tickets were sold for $10 apiece.https://www.sfgate.com/athletics/article/A-s-to-open-Mt-Davis- for-Saturday-game-vs-13079272.php In 2019, they again opened Mount Davis for fans during the Bay Bridge Series against the Giants and for the 2019 American League Wild Card Game against the Tampa Bay Rays. With the tarps off for the wild card game, they set a record for the highest attendance at a Wild Card game at 54,005.

Although it was widely used in the past, the drug has mostly been discontinued and hence is now mostly only available on the black market. A related drug, metenolone acetate, is taken by mouth. Side effects of metenolone enanthate include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has moderate anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, as well as no estrogenic effects or risk of liver damage. Metenolone enanthate is a metenolone ester and a long-lasting prodrug of metenolone in the body. Metenolone enanthate was introduced for medical use in 1962. In addition to its medical use, metenolone enanthate is used to improve physique and performance. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. It remains marketed for medical use only in a few countries, such as Spain and Turkey. Medical uses Metenolone enanthate has been studied in the treatment of breast cancer. Side effects Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= As a derivative of DHT, metenolone, the active form of metenolone enanthate, is not aromatized, and so has no propensity for producing estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia. As an AAS, metenolone enanthate is antigonadotropic and can suppress the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis and produce reversible hypogonadism and infertility. =Pharmacokinetics= The biological half-life of metenolone enanthate is reported to be about 10.5 days by intramuscular injection. Chemistry Metenolone enanthate, or metenolone 17Œ≤-enanthate, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. It is the C17Œ≤ enanthate (heptanoate) ester of metenolone, which itself is 1-methyl-Œ¥1-4,5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (1-methyl-Œ¥1-DHT) or 1-methyl-5Œ±-androst-1-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one. History Metenolone enanthate was introduced for medical use in 1962 in the United States under the brand name Nibal Depot. It was soon discontinued in the United States and was marketed instead in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s under the brand name Primobolan Depot. Society and culture =Generic names= Methenolone enanthate is the of metenolone enanthate, and methenolone is the of its active form, metenolone.

Life James Duckett was born at Gilfortrigs in the parish of Skelsmergh in Westmorland at an unknown date. Brought up a Protestant, he was converted by a book: a friend of his, Peter Mauson lent him The Foundation of the Catholic Religion while Duckett was serving his apprenticeship to a book printer in London, and he decided to become a Catholic.Bassett, Fr. Bernard, \\"The Beatified Bookseller\\", Catholic Herald, p.3, April 20, 1951 He was twice been imprisoned for not attending the Protestant services, first in Bridewell, then in the compter. Both times his employer interceded and got him freed. But then the employer asked James to find a job elsewhere.\\"Blessed James Duckett\\", Saints for Young Readers for Every Day of the Year, Pauline books and Media, Boston, MA. He was received into the Catholic Church by an old priest named Weekes who was imprisoned in the Gatehouse at Westminster. Two or three years later, about 1590, he married a Catholic widow, Anne Hart. Out of his twelve years of married life, nine were spent in prison for his new faith. Their son later became a Carthusian monk and recorded much of what we know about his father. Duckett made his living at that time as a tailor, also making garments, vestments, and altar linens for priests. He was active in propagating Catholic literature. His house was searched, and upon finding a press and copies of Our Lady's Psalter, Ducket was confined to The Clink on St. Thomas' Day before Christmas. He then spent two years in Newgate Prison before being released on bond. Ten weeks later his house was searched again, and although Duckett was able to leave by the back door, he later surrendered to protect those who had posted his bond. He was then sent to The Clink. He was briefly released at the petition of two Protestant midwives when his wife went into labor, but subsequently picked up when it was found that he had sent some English and Latin primers to a bookbinder. He was again released, two knights of the shire going surety for him. He was finally betrayed by Peter Bullock, a bookbinder, who acted in order to obtain his own release from prison. Duckett's house was searched on 4 March 1602 and he was arrested on a charge of having 25 copies of Fr. Southwell's books on his premises. For this he was at once thrown into Newgate. At the trial, Bullock testified that he had bound various Catholic books for Duckett, who admitted this but denied other false accusations in a self-possessed manner. The jury found him not guilty; but the judge, Sir John Popham, the Lord Chief Justice, browbeat the jury, which reversed its verdict and Duckett was found guilty of felony. Despite the betrayal of Duckett, Bullock was taken to his death at Tyburn in the same cart as Duckett on 19 April 1601.Stanton, Rev. Richard, A Menology of england and Wales, or Brief Memorials of the Ancient British and English Saints, p.167, Burns & Oates, Ltd., London, 1892 James Duckett's son was the John Duckett who was Prior of the English Carthusians at Nieuwpoort in Flanders from 1644 to 1647. He related that on the way to Tyburn his father was handed a cup of wine, which he drank, and told his wife to drink to Peter Bullock and to forgive him. When she declined, he chided her gently until she did. On arrival at Tyburn Tree James kissed and embraced Bullock, beseeching him to die in the Catholic faith, without success. At the same trial three priests, Thomas Tichborne, Robert Watkinson, and Francis Page, were condemned to death. For some reason their execution was remanded to the following day. James Duckett was beatified by Pope Pius XI on 15 December 1929.

Some sources refer to \\"Sniper/Patrol\\" as a sort of series of games: a similar game by Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI) was released at the same time as the original Sniper!, called Patrol (1975). Sniper! was rereleased in 1986 in an expanded and improved edition by TSR. Both games dealt with combat on a man-to-man scale in the Second World War, and the rerelease expanded the scope to include the years 1945-1990, as well as combining material from the original Patrol game also. Three companion games to the Second Edition were also released; Hetzer and Special Forces focusing on World War II and post-1945 combat respectively, and Bug Hunter set in a science-fiction setting. Initial Release The first Sniper! game was released in 1973-74, designed by James Dunnigan. According to the BoardGameGeek website, developers included Hank Zucker, John Young, Ed Curran, Bob Felice, Bill Sullivan, Angel Gomez, and Hal Vaughn. Game play focused on urban combat, being subtitled \\"House to House Fighting in World War Two\\". The game was published in three different formats by SPI alone; in a simple white box (a trademark of early SPI games), in a \\"very\\" common SPI black box/tray, and a \\"Designer's Edition\\" with color box and mounted mapboards. A set of \\"footnotes\\" (actually optional rules) was included, covering such things as sewer movement/combat. The mapboard was unique in depicting buildings as trapezoids (technically, parallelograms, though printed material related to the game usually uses the more general term trapezoid) - the abstracted shapes allowed for consistency in Line of Sight rules. The game included 1 34\\" x 22\\" Map, 2 Sniper charts and tables, Game Rules, 1 Pad of Simultaneous Movement Sheets, 1 tray with game pieces, two sets of 2 tanks, two sets of 2 APCs and two sets of 2 trucks as well as 400 die-cut counters in two colors, olive green for Allies and Grey for Germans, with information counters in white. The map itself was in shades of pink/red. The sets of vehicles were printed on cardstock and had to be cut out; they were also trapezoidal in shape. Second Edition A new version of Sniper!, titled Sniper! Second Edition: Game of Man-to-Man Combat, 1941-90 was designed by Steve Winter for TSR, and released in 1986 by TSR using SPI's brand name. Dubbed as the Second Edition of Sniper! and subtitled \\"Game of Man-to-Man Combat, 1941-90\\", it was really a reorganization of both TSR's Sniper! and SPI's board game Patrol. The game came in a handsome box (illustrated at right), containing two large 22\\" x 34\\" paper maps (double sided, with urban terrain on one side and rural terrain on the other), a 32-page rules booklet, a sheet of vehicle pieces on cardstock (these vehicles were square, however, unlike the original trapezoidal vehicles in the original game), two six-sided dice, a plastic counter tray, and 600 die cut counters. The maps were identical to each other, allowing for \\"double-blind\\" play with an umpire. While one side of the maps depicted urban combat similar to the first Sniper! game, the other depicted rural terrain. The urban map made better use of colour than the original, with grey hexes representing pavement and different sized buildings color-coded according to the number of floors they had. The counters were also very colorful, with soldiers and informational markers in a variety of colours. The rulebook was divided into Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Optional rules. In an article in Volume 2, Number 6 of The Wargamer (May‚ÄìJune 1988), designer Steve Winter stated: > I find it immensely interesting that when I first started revising the > Sniper! and Patrol games in 1985, there were only two other wargames (that I > am aware of) that covered modern combat at man-to-man scale. Since then, at > least three more have been published (two of which, like the Sniper! game, > were based heavily on previously published games). Yet, despite this surge > of man-to-man games, very few articles have been published about any of > them. The game used a ground scale of two metres per hex and between thirty seconds and five minutes of time per turn. Screenshot of rural mapsheet (VASSAL version) Hetzer Hetzer was billed as \\"Sniper! Companion Game #1\\" and the Sniper! logo was prominently displayed on the cover. This was a standalone product, subtitled \\"Game of Man-to-Man Combat in Europe, 1940-45\\", and focusing on the Second World War. The game included two 22\\" x 34\\" maps (similar to those in Sniper! but including Normandy style hedgerows), a 24 page rulebook, a second 16 page rulebook, an 8 page book of scenarios, 3 cardstock sheets of vehicles, 2 six-sided dice, a counter tray and 400 die-cut counters. The game was named for the eponymous German self-propelled gun. The initial release was in 1988. A review by James C. Gordon in Vol 2 Number 5 (Christmas 1988) of The Wargamer stated the following: > Hetzer...fills a (niche) in the hobby with a challenging view of ground > level combat situations in World War II. A player must know his objectives > at all times and keep a clear plan in mind. Managing forces of sometimes > questionable reliability, weapons systems with various strengths and > weaknesses, and reacting to the opposition requires the skills of a chess > player.

Physical Quality: Professionally done map and > counters. The rules are well organized. Playability: Lots to remember and > lots to do, but the system is not cumbersome. Some record keeping involved. > Historicity: Derives from the technical details, \\"typical\\" situations and > objectives. Good marks for all. Comparison: Ambush! is similar, although > solitaire. Trenchfoot covers a different era but at the same level. The > original Sniper! had Patrol as a companion. Special Forces Summary Special Forces, billed as \\"Sniper! Companion Game #2\\" was sold in a magazine-type format, with a hard cover folded over loose contents, including two 21\\" x 32\\" maps, a 24-page rulebook, a second 16-page rule book, an 8-page scenario booklet, a reference card, a ziploc bag and 400 die-cut counters. This too was a standalone product, designed by Rick Swan, though the format allowed it to be offered for a reduced price. Swan provided an extended set of Designer's Notes in Volume 2, Number 6 of The Wargamer (May‚ÄìJune 1988). > I was more or less given a free hand to set the scope of the game, so the > first design decision was to establish parameters.

The second option was more attractive - not only would it give > players a lot to pick from, it sounded like it'd be more fun to design and > more like a game I'd like to play. Terry Rooker, writing in Fire and Movement Magazine Number 73, May/June 1991, had the following comments on the suitability of the game system to the subject material ostensibly covered by Special Forces: > Despite its potential, Sniper! (emphasis in original) is lacking. It has > many of the pieces, but it fails to capture some of the most important > aspects of LIC (Light Infantry combat). Part of (the) problem is one of > scale. Platoon and squad sized units are not committed until the > intelligence people have a good idea about what is going on. Much of the > guesswork and uncertainty is missing. Part of the problem is the system. The > original system was designed for WWII infantry engagements. In that type of > warfare, everyone obeys the rules of land warfare and wears a uniform of the > appropriate color. In LIC situations, the situation is not so clear. The > combatants often wear clothing indistinguishable from the non-combatants. > Target identification is much more difficult....For the direct action part > of a mission (however), Sniper! Special Forces is the best game available. Bug Hunter \\"Sniper!\\" Companion Game #3\\" (1988) was a futuristic version of Sniper!, called Bug Hunter, designed by Steve Winter for TSR focuses on \\"the popular science fiction theme of embattled humans threatened by vicious alien creatures in space and on the ground\\" as described in Volume 2, Number 6 of The Wargamer (May‚ÄìJune 1988). According to the BoardGameGeek site: > Bug Hunter is a Sniper!/Patrol! series game about hypothetical clashes > between space-faring human adventurers and hostile alien monsters. As in all > games in the Sniper! series, this game focuses on combat as experienced by > the individual soldier. This game examines the problems and situations > peculiar to close combat in strange environments and against unknown foes. > Multiple geomorphic 2-sided maps are included in the game to play out > numerous scenarios (for from 1 to 3 players), each with their own set of > victory conditions. The game also includes rules to Sniper!, exclusive Bug > Hunter rules, scenario booklet, random event cards, cut out vehicles, and > 400 personnel counters and markers. The geomorphic maps could be combined into two large maps, identical in size and shape to the original Sniper! maps, depicting indoor space stations, again using familiar trapezoidal architectural structures. The same rigid book-cover format as used in Special Forces was used for this release. Game Features in Common All four of the published games were quick to set up and to play, with varying degrees of complexity depending on the rules used. Some unique design features included the use of trapezoidal building depictions on the maps, to better simulate lines of sight, and the use of multi-hex counters (in actuality, thin card stock) to simulate vehicles. At a map scale of 2 metres per hex, some vehicles occupied as many as 8 hexes simultaneously. Video game Steve Estvanik converted the board game series into a multiplayer, online computer game for CompuServe. In the Sniper! a strategy war-game, a player starts as a recruit in the Sniper Saloon & Salad Bar, where players can pick up local gossip, brag about wins, and explain defeats. There, players can also challenge other players to a Sniper! game, or play the computerized opponent. A drill instructor waits in the Bootcamp to show you new players how the game is played. The Halls of Fame also display players' best scores. In a game of Patrol two opposing squads, Alpha and Bravo, meet in no-man's land between their front lines. In a game of Infiltrate, the Alpha force must cross from one side of the map to the other, exiting the map at Bravo‚Äôs Victory Point area before Bravo can stop Alpha. The player has a small squad of soldiers to command, and plays either the Germans or the Americans, somewhere in western Europe during World War II. Paul C. Schuytema reviewed the Sniper! computer game in the January 1993 issue of Compute! (Issue 148): > CompuServe offers SNIPER!, a European-theater, squad-level, World War II war > game. The game can be played in ASCII, but the text characters are far too > cryptic for my tastes.

The game given a positive review in Computer Gaming World, admiring it both as a social experience as well as a competitive game. Notes 1 Close Assault by S. Craig Taylor was set in World War II and released by Yaquinto in 1983. It was reworked by Taylor as a modern game and released by Avalon Hill in 1984 as Firepower. One of the other \\"modern\\" games mentioned by Winter may be Ranger which deals with post World War II combat (released in 1984 by Omega Games). A much earlier game named City Fight had been released by SPI in 1979 and may also be what Winter refers to. 2 It is unclear at present which three subsequent games Winter is referring to. Firepower and its predecessor Close Assault has been mentioned. Battle Cry may be one of them; it was released in 1986 by 3W. Soldiers was released by West End Games in 1987, focusing on World War II man-to-man combat.

A reverse stock split is also called a stock merge. The \\"reverse stock split\\" appellation is a reference to the more common stock split in which shares are effectively divided to form a larger number of proportionally less valuable shares. New shares are typically issued in a simple ratio, e.g. 1 new share for 2 old shares, 3 for 4, etc. A reverse split is the opposite of a stock split. Typically, the exchange temporarily adds a \\"D\\" to the end of a ticker symbol during a reverse stock split. Sometimes a company may concurrently change its name. This is known as a name change and consolidation (i.e. using a different ticker symbol for the new shares). There is a stigma attached to doing a reverse stock split, as it underscores the fact that shares have declined in value, so it is not common and may take a shareholder or board meeting for consent. Many institutional investors and mutual funds, for example, have rules against purchasing a stock whose price is below some minimum, perhaps US$5. A common reason for a reverse stock split is to satisfy a stock exchange's minimum share price.Kawamoto D (2000), Reverse splits aren't always reversals of fortune CNET News, 16 November 2000 A reverse stock split may be used to reduce the number of shareholders. If a company completes a reverse split in which 1 new share is issued for every 100 old shares, any investor holding fewer than 100 shares would simply receive a cash payment. If the number of shareholders drops, the company may be placed into a different regulatory category and may be governed by different law--for example, in the U.S., whether a company is regulated by the SEC depends in part on the number of shareholders. From time to time, companies will issue a reverse split concurrently with a forward split, making a reverse/forward split. Note that in reverse/forward splits, the shareholder's old shares are erased, as they receive a number of new shares in proportion to their original holdings. By contrast, in a simple stock split, the original shares remain on the exchange as shareholders receive additional shares based on their existing holdings. In both stock splits and reverse splits, the share price is adjusted in proportion to the increase in shares to maintain equal value. As an example of how reverse splits work, ProShares Ultrashort Silver (ZSL) underwent a 1-10 reverse split on April 15, 2010, which grouped every 10 shares into one share; accordingly, this multiplied the close price by 10, so the stock finished at $36.45 instead of $3.645. On February 25, 2011, ZSL had a 1-4 reverse split (every 4 shares became one share, which multiplied the close price by 4, to $31.83). Because of these two actions, one share of ZSL as of February 26, 2011 represents 40 shares of ZSL before April 15, 2010. These splits were necessary to maintain the share price of the fund, whose value fell 90.2% from April 15, 2010 to April 21, 2011, and over 98% since December 3, 2008. Had the reverse splits not taken place, ZSL's closing price on April 21, 2011 would have been $0.3685, rather than $14.74, or .3685*40.Quotes, dates and split dates for ZSL come from Fidelity as accessed via their Active Trader Pro console References External links *Stock split and reverse split examples for shareholders (from the Internet Archive) Stock market he:◊î◊ï◊ü ◊û◊†◊ô◊ï◊™#◊§◊ô◊¶◊ï◊ú ◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ó◊ï◊ì ◊û◊†◊ô◊ï◊™ ","title":"Reverse stock split"},{"id":"3519116","text":"upright=0.7 thumb European route E45 in Sweden, previously Swedish national road 45, is a national road and the longest road in Sweden, with a length of 1,690 km (1,050 mi). It is one of the longest national roads in Europe. It covers the stretch between Gothenburg and Karesuando via Trollh√§ttan, V√§nersborg, Mellerud, √Öm√•l, S√§ffle, Grums, Sunne, Torsby, St√∂llet, Malung, Mora, Sveg, Brunflo, √ñstersund, Str√∂msund, Dorotea, Vilhelmina, Storuman, Sorsele, Arvidsjaur, Jokkmokk, G√§llivare, Svappavaara, and Vittangi. It is also called Inlandsv√§gen (The Inland Road) as it traverses almost the entire length of Sweden. Most sections of the road pass through substantial and thinly populated wilderness areas in western Sweden. In many places the E45 road runs alongside the Inlandsbanan railway (The Inland Railway). Road standard and plans The road is single carriageway ordinary road almost all of it. There is a motorway between Gothenburg and Trollh√§ttan. It goes straight through many villages along the route. It goes through only one big city, Gothenburg, and a few smaller towns, Trollh√§ttan, S√§ffle, Mora and G√§llivare. It goes outside √Öm√•l and √ñstersund. North of E18 the road goes through sparsely populated areas and the places passed are rather small. The width of the road is usually 9-12 m south of E18, 7-9 m between E18 and E14 and 6-7 m north of E14. The road E45 turns at road junctions 27 times in Sweden. There are a few smaller improvement plans. There is a plan for a bypass of Sveg, which will shorten the route by 18 km, planned around year 2020 (the construction start has been delayed several times mainly for political reasons). There will also be some improvements of the existing road at a few places. Apart from that very little is planned before 2025. History The Swedish road 45 has become an extension of the European route E45 and has been redesignated as such. The re-signing of the road started with several ceremonies along the road on November 24, 2006, and was completed during September 2007. National road 45 will not appear on signs after that, since European route are signed only with the E-sign in Sweden (although they are formally a national road with the same number). Some old \\"45\\" signs have been forgotten and left behind, mostly on city streets, since cities were not given money to change their signs. The road G√∂teborg-Karesuando was given the number 45 in year 1991. Before that it had several numbers. From south they were 45 (G√∂teborg-Grums), 234 (Grums-Mora), 81 (Mora-√ñstersund) and 88 (√ñstersund-Karesuando). Before the year 1985 the road √ñstersund-Karesuando had several numbers, 88, 343, 97, 98, 395 and 396. Before year 1962 the road G√∂teborg-Grums was called road 7.

It was established in 1652 when the Massachusetts Bay Colony first asserted territorial claims over the settlements of southern Maine, extending from the Piscataqua River to just east of the mouth of the Presumpscot River in Casco Bay. The county eventually grew to encompass effectively all of present-day Maine, although the interior was claimed by various Abenaki peoples, and the territory east of Penobscot Bay was claimed (and partly occupied) as part of French Acadia. By 1760 most of the Abenaki had either been wiped out or retreated northward toward the Saint Lawrence River, and New France had been conquered in the French and Indian War. The large size of the county led to its division in 1760, with Cumberland and Lincoln counties carved out of its eastern portions. When Massachusetts adopted its state government in 1780, it created the District of Maine to manage its eastern territories. In 1805 the northern portion of York County was separated to form part of Oxford County. When Maine achieved statehood in 1820 all of the counties of the District of Maine became counties of Maine.

It is a member of the Southern University System and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. History Southern University was founded in New Orleans in 1880; and moved out of the city in 1914; the current Southern University at New Orleans should not be confused with that earlier Southern University in New Orleans. Southern University at New Orleans was founded as a branch unit of Southern University and Agricultural & Mechanical College (Southern University) in Baton Rouge by Act 28 of the Extraordinary Session of the Louisiana Legislature of September 4, 1956. On September 21, 1959 SUNO opened its doors on a 17-acre site located in historic Pontchartrain Park, a subdivision of primarily African American single-family residences in eastern New Orleans. Established as an open community of learners, classes began with 158 freshmen, one building and a faculty of fifteen. The University offered ten courses in four academic disciplines, including Humanities, Science, Social Science and Commerce. The first graduation took place in May 1963 when baccalaureate degrees were awarded to 15 graduates. In 1959, Dr. Felton G. Clark, president of Southern, asked Dr. Emmett W. Bashful to open SUNO. Dr. Bashful began as dean of the University. In 1969, he was named vice president, and he was eventually named chancellor in 1977. Of SUNO's founding, Dr. Bashful wrote, \\"In August, 1959, Dr. F. G. Clark, then President of Southern University at Baton Rouge, presented my name to the Louisiana State Board of Education as Dean of the projected New Orleans Campus. Several days later, I came to New Orleans and after examining the campus, realized what a monumental task I faced. The one building under construction was hardly near completion; the faculty had been only partially recruited; no office space was then available on campus; and it was expected that classes would begin sometime in September.\\" =Expansion and change= Over the years several events have affected the direction of SUNO. Within five years SUNO grew rapidly. During the fall of 1964 the University's enrollment grew to 1,300. On November 8, 1960 the Louisiana Legislature adopted Amendment 26 which act prescribed that SUNO should remain an extension of Southern University, thereby precluding any impending status of autonomy for SUNO. In January, 1964 Virginia Cox Welch, a white high school teacher, filed a lawsuit in Federal Court against the Louisiana State Board of Education. The litigation, Civil Action No. 14217, resulted in opening the University to all regardless of race or color. In 1975 the management of SUNO was transferred from the Louisiana State Board of Education to the newly created Board of Supervisors of Southern University by virtue of Article 8, Section 7 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974. The new constitution also designated SUNO as a campus of the Southern University System creating parity with the other Southern University campuses. SUNO would later benefit from a consent decree on September 8, 1981. The court order, which was handed down by federal judges as an out-of-court settlement between the State of Louisiana and the Justice Department over the issue of segregation, allowed SUNO to add nine academic programs and also to receive funds to upgrade campus facilities. Despite the order racial discrimination in the higher education landscape remained an issue. As a result of Civil Action 80-3300 on November 14, 1994 the United States, the State of Louisiana, the governor of Louisiana, the Louisiana Board of Regents, the Boards of Supervisors for Louisiana State University and Southern University and the Board of Trustees for State Colleges and Universities agreed to a desegregation settlement. The settlement, which was effective through 2004, enabled SUNO to retain its open admissions status and classification as a Four Year-V university. The University, as a result, expected to qualify as a Four Year-IV institution by offering four-year undergraduate programs and graduate programs in specific areas. As time progressed the University took advantage of valuable opportunities to boost its academic programs. The most notable progress came in SUNO's School of Social Work. Guided by the institution's first dean, Millie McClelland Charles, the School of Social Work blossomed into one of the most recognized programs in the South. As a result, the popularity of the School of Social Work's Master of Social Work program grew. In the fall of 2008, the Master of Social Work program grew to capacity with 150 students and many more candidates on the waiting list. SUNO's Criminal Justice program also gained notoriety. Offering both undergraduate and graduate degrees, the Criminal Justice program has evolved into a program that delves into seeking community solutions to prevent criminal behavior through the study of the causes of criminal behavior. The program is complemented by studies in the social sciences and has become a program of choice of those seeking career enhancements in law, law enforcement and the justice system. The sciences garnered a wealth of attention in the early 2000s (decade) when SUNO aggressively implemented components of the Program for Excellence in Mathematics and Computer Technology (PESMaCT) as well as the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LAMP). Through the programs, University science instructors have been able to increase the number and quality of minority students enrolling in and completing undergraduate and advanced degrees in the sciences, technology and mathematics. Because of the diligent work of the faculty, one of the instructors Dr. Joe Omojola, received a 2006 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring from the National Science Foundation. = Hurricane Katrina = SUNO's Park Campus, the original campus at 6400 Press Drive, was completely compromised as a result of the levee breaches caused by Hurricane Katrina and the storm surge later caused by Hurricane Rita. Flood waters grew to as high as eleven feet in the buildings, causing the school's physical plant to require replacement. The damage caused SUNO to finish its fall 2005 semester on its sister campus in Baton Rouge. Operations as well as classes were conducted at Southern University until a temporary campus was assembled at 6801 Press Drive on land that SUNO owned but had not utilized extensively. After negotiations with the State of Louisiana, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers the University was able to open a temporary facility, called the North Campus (later to be named the Lake Campus) on February 14, 2006. Until January 2008, SUNO operated completely out of the trailers. Not only was there physical damage done to the University, but its academics had also been threatened. Twenty of the University's programs were stripped due to the loss of students and faculty. Prior to Katrina SUNO's enrollment exceeded 3,600 students but it was projected that the enrollment would dip to as few as 1,200 students. To the surprise of many, SUNO's enrollment regained more than 2,000 including online students when the University returned to grounds near the Park Campus in the spring of 2006. By request of the Louisiana Board of Regents the University added undergraduate degrees in Public Administration, Health Information Systems and Child Development & Family Studies. The University also converted several previously administered undergraduate degrees into Management Information Systems and Business Entrepreneurship. The University also offers a master's degree in Management Information Systems as a result of the conversion. In the fall of 2008, the Board of Regents approved the reinstatement of undergraduate degrees in English, History and Mathematics. The fall of 2008 saw more advancements for SUNO as the student population climbed to 3,105. The University occupied several buildings on its Park Campus since Katrina, and began construction on the first residence halls in the history of the institution, which opened in January 2010. Plans for development of the Lake Campus moved forward with the opening of the Information Technology Center and construction on the College of Business and Public Administration, which will include a $3 million business incubator. On August 17, 2009, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano announced that FEMA would provide more than $32 million in additional funding to rebuild four educational buildings at SUNO. The money was marked for replacement of the University's Old Science, New Science, Multipurpose, and Clark education buildings. In total, more than $92 million in FEMA public assistance had been obligated for SUNO, including $40 million since March 2009. Previous funding had helped renovate the University's Cafeteria, Health & Physical Education, and Maintenance buildings. = 2011 Merger Debate = On January 18, 2011, Governor Bobby Jindal made a request of the Louisiana Board of Regents to study the feasibility of merging SUNO and the University of New Orleans and moving both institutions under the umbrella of the University of Louisiana System. The study was completed, and the results were delivered to the Board of Regents in a March 14 meeting. Later that evening, Gov. Jindal announced that he would write legislation recommending Alternative B. On March 15, the Board of Regents voted nine to six to accept Gov. Jindal's proposal to recommend the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems' \\"Alternative B\\" plan to \\"include a comprehensive community college and a new multi-unit University of Greater New Orleans. The University of Greater New Orleans would include an urban research university unit and a metropolitan university unit each headed by a chief academic officer under a single president located on the current site of the University of New Orleans.\\" Within that same vote, the Board recommended including the Southern University System's proposal \\"A Focused Learning Approach to Strengthen the Role of Public Higher Education in Building a Greater New Orleans: The Honor√© Center for Undergraduate Student Achievement\\" named for Southern University graduate and post-Hurricane Katrina hero Gen. Russell Honor√©. Louisiana state Senator Conrad Appel (Dist. 9, Metairie) filed Senate Bill 183 which aimed to create the University of Louisiana at New Orleans. Rep. Tucker later filed House Bill 537 which called for the merging of SUNO and UNO. The next few months resulted in protests from SUNO students, faculty, alumni, and community supporters in addition to highly emotional testimony from those same parties at the Board of Regents' March meeting and the Louisiana House Education and Appropriations Committee meetings. On May 18, Rep. Tucker pulled SUNO from HB 537 due to a lack of support from his fellow House members. As a result, the bill only called for UNO's transition from the Louisiana State University System to the University of Louisiana System, which eventually approved by the legislature and Gov. Jindal. Because of HB 537's failure, Sen. Appel also removed SUNO from SB 183. In 2019, the university's regional accreditor placed the New Orleans campus on probation and the university began furloughing employees. Several months later, the New Orleans campus of the university also announced plans to suspend all intercollegiate athletic programs at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. Academics Southern University at New Orleans is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the Council for Social Work Education, and the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education Southern University at New Orleans is the only institution in Louisiana to offer an advanced degree in museum studies. = Academics = The university offers degrees in five colleges and schools: ;College of Arts and Sciences *Bachelor of Arts *Bachelor of Science *Bachelor of General Studies ;College of Business and Public Administration *Bachelor of Arts in Public Administration *Bachelor of Science ;College of Education and Human Development *Bachelor of Arts in Child Development and Family Studies *Bachelor of Science ;College of Social Work *Bachelor of Arts in Social Welfare ;School of Graduate Studies *Master of Arts *Master of Science *Master of Social Work Student life There are more than thirty student organizations (academic, religious, NPHC sororities, NPHC fraternities, etc.) that are registered through the Student Activities and Organizations Office. These groups afford students the opportunity to develop organizational, social and communication skills.  Athletics The Southern‚ÄìNew Orleans Knights (men's teams) and Lady Knights (women's teams) represent Southern University at New Orleans in intercollegiate athletics. The University is a Division I member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference. The Health and Physical Education Building, nicknamed The Castle, is the 1,200-seat arena for the men's and women's basketball teams and volleyball team. It opened in 1974.

Clinch fighting is stand-up grappling. Fighters employ striking, including striking combinations, using either body parts or m√™l√©e weapons, to incapacitate or injure the opponent. Combatants use blocking techniques to block the opponent's attacks. Martial arts and combat sports that emphasize stand-up fighting include boxing (including bare-knuckle boxing), j≈çd≈ç, karate, kendo, kickboxing, kung fu (sanda/sanshou), Muay Thai, savate, silat, and Taekwondo. Stand-up fighting distances The nature of the stand-up fighting depends on whether the combatants are unarmed or use m√™l√©e weapons. Batons become less effective at short, especially clinching range, where they cannot be swung properly. Knives on the other hand do not need as much thrusting space to generate damage. In stand-up fighting without m√™l√©e weapons, it is possible to separate the distances between the combatants according to which strikes can reach the opponent. The comfort zone is a non- combat distance from which it is not possible to kick the opponent without closing the distance considerably. From this zone the combatant might carefully close in on the opponent to engage with strikes. Kicking distance: Fighters in kicking distance Kicking distance: The kicking distance is the most distant unarmed fighting position in which consistent contact can be made with the opponent. The combatants can use far-reaching quick kicks to the legs, body or head of the opponent. Martial arts such as Taekwondo emphasize the kicking distance in fighting. Punching distance: Fighters in punching distance Punching distance: The punching distance is the zone where punches can be thrown, and this is the distance from the furthest jab to the closest hook, as long as no grappling is taking place. In addition to punches, this distance often also allows for elbows and knees, though using them requires closing in to the clinching distance. Boxing is a combat sport that concerns itself exclusively with the punching distance. However many martial arts, particularly those that employ extreme close range fighting (for example Wing Chun and Southern Praying Mantis) train ranges within punch range, but do not necessarily employ clinching techniques. This collection of ranges is often called the in-fighting range.Defensive Tactics: Distance In rules that allow both stand-up and ground-fighting, such as those of mixed martial arts, takedowns can also be launched from this distance. Going for a takedown from this distance is generally referred to as a shoot. Clinching zone: Fighters in a muay thai clinch Clinching zone: The clinching or trapping zone refers to the same distance as the punching distance, except that one or both combatants grapple, and at the same time prevent the other from moving into a more distant contact zone or into the comfort zone by using a clinch hold. This zone involves a multitude of both striking and grappling techniques, and is discussed in its own article clinch fighting. References External links * L√∏vstad, Jakob.

The mosque itself was constructed in 1578-1580. The complex is located in the Tophane neighbourhood of the Beyoƒülu district of Istanbul, Turkey. It is named after Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha. It consists of a mosque, a medrese, a hamam, a t√ºrbe, and a fountain. Originally, it had been on the coastline, but since the sea in front of it has been filled again, it is now surrounded by other buildings. The complex was built on the orders of the Kapudan-i Derya (Grand Admiral) Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha. When the Pasha was told to build the complex on the sea for being the Chief Captain, he had the mosque built on the land reclaimed from the sea. Architecture Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa chronogram There are two chronograms that date the mosque, both yielding the year 988 in the Hijri (Islamic) calendar (1580 in the Julian calendar). One of the two inscriptions, at the outer entrance of the complex, features a 4-verse poem in jali thuluth calligraphic script in Ottoman Turkish by the poet Ulv√Æ and written by calligrapher Demircikulu Yusuf: > M√Ær-i bahr √¢‚Äôn√Æ Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Pa≈üa Kapudan-ƒ± zem√¢n > Yaptƒ± √ß√ºn bu camii ola yeri Dar√ºssel√¢m > H√¢tif-i kuds√Æ g√∂r√ºp Ulv√Æ dedi tarihini > Ehl-i im√¢na ib√¢detg√¢h olsun bu makam The letters in the final line, ‚ÄúMay this be a house of worship for people of the faith,‚Äù add up to the number 988. All three doors of the courtyard are ornamented. The courtyard also has a marble fountain for ablution before prayer with eight columns and a dome. The outer porch has a sloping roof supported by twelve columns on the west fa√ßade and three on each side, all with rhombus-shaped capitals. In the center is a marble portal. At the outer courtyard in the graveyard stands an octagonal t√ºrbe with a dome also made by Mimar Sinan. Its wooden doors are inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha's tomb lies inside the t√ºrbe. The medrese, opposite the southeast corner of the mosque, is almost square. This structure might not be constructed by Mimar Sinan as it is not in the official list of his works, the Tazkirat-al- Abniya. To the right of the mosque is the hamam, of which the construction was completed in 1583. The glass doors lead into two separate soƒüukluks (cool rooms) that are placed on either sides of the hararet (caldarium-hot room) which is hexagonal in plan with open bathing places in four of its six arched recesses, the other two opening to the soƒüukluks. The placement of the soƒüukluks and the plan of the hararet differ from the usual application carried out by Sinan in his other extant hamams. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa mosque and Tophane fountain =Mosque= The central dome of the mosque is in diameter, carried on pendentives on granite piers and two half-domes on the Qibla axis. Towards the entrance, on two sides, there is a two-story gallery. The dome is placed at the center with two exedrae similar to a Byzantine basilica, thus the resemblance to Hagia Sophia. Above the prayer hall are five small domes carried on six marble columns. The tile panels placed high in the prayer hall are inscribed with ayats (verses) from the Quran.

It is said that when Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha decided to endow a mosque toward the end of his life, he applied to the state for a grant of land (since all land belonged to the state in the Ottoman Empire). He and Grand Vizier R√ºstem Pasha shared a strong dislike for each other, so the Vizier reportedly said: \\"Since he is the admiral, let him build his mosque on the sea.\\" Undeterred, Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha had tons of rocks brought from all over the region and built the mosque on an artificial island connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway. The mosque is now well inland, since the sea was filled during the construction of a modern port.

Early life Annabella Piugattuk was born December 19, 1982, in Frobisher Bay, Northwest Territories (what is now Iqaluit, Nunavut), Canada. She was raised with her four brothers and younger sister in Igloolik, a village with a population of 1,286 in Nunavut. Throughout her childhood, Annabella spent time with her grandfather, listening to his stories of their ancestral past and developing a deep understanding of Inuit tradition. She became adept at hunting and wilderness survival techniques. Acting career Annabella became interested in acting after her grade eight teacher involved her in a school play. At the age of 19, she read a story in the Nunatsiaq News about casting directors in town searching for actors for a new film, The Snow Walker. Encouraged by her mother, Annabella obtained a copy of the script from company representatives, who were distributing them. That Friday night, at a community dance with friends, Annabella was approached by casting director Jared Valentine, who asked her to audition for the role of Kanaalaq. After attending local auditions, the diminutive teenager (she is 4'9\\") and five other semi-finalists were flown to Vancouver to do screen tests. A few weeks after returning home, she received word that she was offered the part. In the film The Snow Walker, Annabella plays the character of Kanaalaq, a young Inuit woman who helps a Canadian bush pilot to survive the harsh conditions of the Northwest Territories following an airplane crash. Like the character she portrays, Annabella is an Inuit throat singer, and can fish, hunt seal and walrus, and make clothing out of caribou hides. For her role in The Snow Walker, Piugattuk received a Genie nomination as best supporting actress in 2004. In 2005, Annabella appeared in the TV miniseries Into the West in the role of Dancing Water. Annabella lives in Iqaluit, Nunavut.

The concept was used by PABX manufacturers as the basis of families of products in which the PBX would supply data connectivity and applications along with its traditional voice services. The office controller would be a central switch which would link users to applications and provide necessary services such as security. There was much discussion at that time of multimedia voice/data services but the conception of these services was very vague. There was no real understanding of the utility and therefore customer value of these services. As a result, office controller services were usually restricted to various forms of modem pooling. With the development of LANs and PCs, client/server became the dominant distributed application model, along with standalone applications as PCs became more powerful. As a result, the centralised model supported by the office controller fell out of style. Office controller products were withdrawn from the market. Remnants of the idea, with examples such as thin clients and three-layer architectures, did persist with some interest. However the thick client PC model of services was predominant in the 1990s. However the office controller idea is not without merit. With the development of SIP with its session border controllers and service- oriented architectures, the centralized creation and management of user services is again finding widespread interest.

The Dutch prevented the Spanish army from dividing the Dutch United Provinces in two. Background In reaction to an overland Dutch attempt to capture Dunkirk earlier in the year, Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, governing the Southern Netherlands for Philip IV of Spain, ordered a Spanish army transported on a fleet of barges to attempt to occupy the islands of Goeree and Overflakee by surprise. In particular, the Spanish wished to overpower the large fortresses on either side of the Volkerak Strait. The fortress on the continental side had special propaganda value, as it was a newly founded town named Willemstad after William the Silent; more importantly, Spanish occupation would have allowed a blockade of the Dutch main naval port Hellevoetsluis located to the direct north of Overflakee on the island of Voorne; and the isolation of the province of Zealand from its confederate provinces. The battle A Spanish fleet of ninety vessels and 5,500 men under the direction of Don Francisco de Moncada, Marquis of Aytona, but in fact commanded by Count Jan van Nassau Siegen, a catholic cousin of the Calvinist Dutch House of Orange, mostly consisting of small transports, departed from Antwerp. The project could not be kept a secret however and a Dutch task force of fifty ships, also largely consisting of small rivercraft but containing some larger flyboats, under Zealandic Vice- Admiral Marinus Hollare, intercepted the fleet in the Eastern Scheldt. Seeing their intended route blocked, the Spanish first tried to capture the more southern island of Tholen instead, to show something for their efforts, but this attempt was thwarted by a regiment of two thousand English and Scots mercenaries under the command of Colonel Thomas Morgan from the continental fortress of Steenbergen who marched at low tide through the shallow sea to the island, arriving just in time to deter a landing. Van Nassau in his desperation then took the bold decision to attempt to sneak past the Dutch fleet during the night and so achieve the original goal after all. The Spanish movement however was noticed despite a fog; despite their small number the Dutch first allowed the enemy fleet to pass completely before cutting them off. Once this was achieved the Dutch suddenly attacked the Spanish from behind in the Slaak of Volkerak channel and were routed. Hundreds drowned as they tried to escape the ships and those that did escape were captured by the waiting Dutch and English troops ashore. Over 4,000 troops and seamen were captured along with the majority of ships. Van Nassau himself and two ships accompanying him managed to escape to Antwerp; it is not exactly known how many others escaped, perhaps as much as a third of his fleet. Aftermath The Admiralty of Amsterdam suggested throwing all prisoners into the sea ‚Äî until that time the officially prescribed method for the Dutch to dispense with enemy combatants captured at sea ‚Äî to deter further attempts, but stadtholder Frederick Henry of Orange forbade this. One of the captains distinguishing himself was the later Lieutenant-Admiral Johan Evertsen, his brother the later Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Evertsen de Oude also participated. The defeat was one out of a series of setbacks for the Habsburg policy in the Thirty Years War waged the same time in the larger German theatre; it influenced a decision in 1632 to reach a peace settlement between the Habsburgs and the Republic ‚Äî the peace talks were unsuccessful however.

The book was an insightful study of James' great predecessor Nathaniel Hawthorne. James gave extended consideration to each of Hawthorne's novels and a selection of his short stories. He also reviewed Hawthorne's life and some of his nonfiction. The book became somewhat controversial for a famous section where James enumerated the items of novelistic interest he thought were absent from American life. Summary and themes This is the only book-length study James wrote about a fellow novelist, and it is not surprising he picked Hawthorne for such extended treatment. The tradition Hawthorne began in American literature - the morally intense exploration of the universality of guilt and the ambiguities of human choice - was clearly carried on by James. Although James expressed misgivings about some of Hawthorne's more extravagant symbolism and heavy reliance on allegory, he shared his predecessor's constant interest in moral quandaries, divided loyalties, and the inevitable conflicts between imaginative protagonists and intractable reality. James also shared Hawthorne's passion for careful craftmanship and thorough, unsparing analysis of character. James' ranking of Hawthorne's novels, from The Scarlet Letter down to The Marble Faun, has generally been accepted by later critics. Although James, at least in his earlier work, was more of a consistent realist than Hawthorne, the later novelist's work always betrays the influence of his predecessor's tendency towards metaphorical expression. In James' final novels such as The Golden Bowl, this influence becomes even more pronounced in extended metaphor and complex symbolism. Critical evaluation By and large James' book has enjoyed favorable reviews from later critics. They have usually recommended the book as one of permanent interest and still well worth reading. Critics have disagreed about how closely James followed Hawthorne's example, though there's general agreement that the influence was considerable, especially as James' fiction became more symbolic and dominated by psychological introspection. The book is free from critical jargon and easily accessible to readers with little or no knowledge of Hawthorne's works. James can be surprisingly cutting and humorous about some of Hawthorne's more questionable flights of fancy. When Arthur Dimmesdale in The Scarlet Letter supposedly beholds an immense letter A marked out in dim red lines in the night sky, James says that Hawthorne is \\"crossing the line which separates the sublime from its intimate neighbor. We are tempted to say that this is not moral tragedy, but physical comedy.\\" References * Henry James Literary Criticism - Essays on Literature, American Writers, English Writers edited by Leon Edel and Mark Wilson (New York: Library of America 1984) External links *Text of Hawthorne (1879) *Note on the text of Hawthorne at the Library of America web site 1879 non-fiction books Books by Henry James Books about writers Nathaniel Hawthorne ","title":"Hawthorne (book)"},{"id":"3519212","text":"Praise and worship may refer to: * The overall praise and worship of God, for example: ** Jewish prayer ** Christian worship ** Salah, Islamic prayer * A time of congregational singing; see contemporary worship ** A style of music; see contemporary worship music * Praise & Worship (Commissioned album), 2006 album See also * Praise (disambiguation) * Worship (disambiguation) ","title":"Praise and worship"},{"id":"3519213","text":"SHL may refer to: Industry *SHL, a Polish motorcycle brand from 1938 to 1970 *Huta Ludwik√≥w (often abbreviated SHL), a Polish manufacturer of metal parts Sports *Supreme Hockey League *Southern Hockey League (disambiguation) *Swedish Hockey League (), the highest league in Swedish ice hockey *Swiss Handball League (), the two highest league in Swiss handball Other *The x86 command for shift left *Sacred Himalayan Landscape (SHL), a conservation area located mostly in Nepal *Schmidt hammer lassen, a Danish architecture firm *Senate House Libraries, a former grouping of academic libraries in Bloomsbury, London, in existence from 2011 to 2013 *Shillong Airport, IATA code SHL, Meghalaya, India *Southern Highlands Line, an Intercity rail service in New South Wales, Australia *Student Homophile League (SHL), former name of Columbia Queer Alliance, Columbia University, New York City, U.S. ","title":"SHL"},{"id":"3519225","text":"Lincoln Beach was an amusement park in New Orleans, Louisiana, functioning from 1939 through 1965. The park was for the area's African American population during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Deco sign on Hayne Boulevard is one of the few reminders of the long closed amusement park Lincoln Beach was located along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain near Little Woods, in a portion of the Eastern New Orleans section of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans that was little developed in the 1930s. The land where Lincoln Beach was located was deeded to the city by Sam Zemurray in 1938 and purchased within a year by the Orleans Levee Board. The Levee Board first designated this section as a swimming area in the lake for \\"colored\\" New Orleanians, then built out additional land in the lake for the amusement park to be built on. The park was similar to the then \\"whites only\\" Pontchartrain Beach amusement park, only on a smaller scale. It featured various rides, games, restaurants, a swimming pool in addition to lake swimming, and frequent live music performances. In the last decade, Fats Domino was repeatedly a featured musical act. Pontchartrain Beach was desegregated in 1964, and business declined rapidly at Lincoln Beach, which, having been rendered obsolete, closed soon afterward. Although there have been various proposals to redevelop the Lincoln Beach site, the decaying ruins of the park have remained vacant for decades.

Cracknell (born 1935) is a British specialist in interfaith dialogue and the Christian theology of religions. Cracknell has written many articles and books on interfaith dialogue and other subjects, including Towards a New Relationship (1985), Justice Courtesy and Love (1994), An Introduction to World Methodism (2005), and In Good and Generous Faith (2005). A festschrift, A Great Commission (2000) edited by Martin Forward, Stephen Plant and Susan White, includes scholarly articles by numerous friends and colleagues on the occasion of Cracknell's 65th birthday. He has pioneered a sensitive and respectful Christian approach to the religious Other while dealing skillfully with Bible verses that for some demand a total condemnation of other religions and the conversion of their followers. Wesley S. Ariarajah, former director of inter-religions relations at the World Council of Churches describes Cracknell's discussion as \\"a probing exegesis of the apparently exclusive verses.\\" Ariarajah, Wesley S Hindus and Christians: A Century of Protestant Ecumenical Thought, Grand Rapids: William B Eeerdmans, 199I p 215 Defining mission as witnessing to the compassionate presence of God in the world modeled by the life and suffering of Jesus Christ, Cracknell does not reject conversion from one faith to another but is more concerned with movement towards a deeper relationship with God and with loving action in God's world to reduce pain, poverty and prejudice. His Justice, Courtesy and Love examines the contributions of Christian scholars including missionaries whose encounter with the religious Other deepened their own understanding of the nature of God's concern for the restoration of human and planetary health. His career included pioneering the interfaith relations work of the British Council of Churches, teaching at University of Cambridge and at Brite Divinity School, Texas from where he retired in 2007 as Distinguished Professor of Theology and Global Studies. Education Cracknell obtained a B.D. degree from the Universities of London (1959) and Oxford (1995). He was educated at the University of Oxford (BA, MA) and the University of Leeds (Post Graduate Certificate with distinction in Religion) and at the Richmond Methodist College, London where he trained for ministry. Career A British subject and Methodist minister, he began his career teaching in Nigeria through the Methodist Church Overseas Mission Division, then served as the first Director for Interfaith Relations in the British Council of Churches from 1978 until 1987 at first under the chairmanship of David Brown, Bishop of Guildford and (from 1983) of Bishop Jim Thompson. He has been associated with the World Council of Churches as a member of the Dialogue Sub-Unit, later the Office on Inter-religious Relations. Cracknell's scholarship is widely cited. Marcus Braybrooke, historian of interreligious relations, refers to Cracknell as \\"the influential Methodist thinker\\" in his contribution to Islam and Global Dialogue (2005) (edited by Roger Boase). Braybrooke, Marcus (2005) p 215. =The Four Principles of Dialogue= At the BCC, one of Cracknell's most important contributions was developing and promoting the \\"four principles of interfaith dialogue\\". He redacted these from the 13 principles contained in the WCC's Guidelines on Dialogue with People of Living Faiths and Ideologies (1979). They are: #Dialogue begins when people meet each other; #Dialogue depends on mutual trust and mutual understanding; #Dialogue makes it possible to share in service to the community; #Dialogue becomes the medium of authentic witness. Several member churches including the Church of England endorsed these before Cracknell left the BCC in 1987. =Promoting Christian Reflection= Cracknell founded the Association for Ministerial Training in a Multifaith Society, which held annual conferences attended by upwards of 200 clergy over several years, exploring how theological education ought to respond to the reality and challenges of multiculturalism. As national conversation in the United Kingdom about citizenship, identity and belonging and the place of the nation's Christian heritage (and established Church) developed, Cracknell began the process that resulted in the publication of an important Christian contribution to this discussion, Belonging to Britain: Christian perspectives on religion and identity in a plural society (1991) (edited by Roger Hooker and John Sargant) to which he also contributed. =Cracknell's missiology= The fact that the interfaith committee at the British Council of Churches was at the time located within the Mission Division and was mainly funded by Missionary Societies made reflection on mission an almost inevitable aspect of the director's role. Cracknell's sustained interest in Christian mission is indicated by the title chosen for the 2000 volume, A Great Commission, edited by Martin Forward, in honor of his scholarly contribution. Cracknell's 1985 book, Towards A New Relationship written while serving at the BCC explored many of the Biblical passages, such as John 14: 6 and Acts 4: 2 that Christian cite to defend an exclusive view of salvation as found only through an explicit, with the lips confession of Jesus as Lord and Savior. Cracknell argued that salvation is to be found \\"in the Name\\" but that \\"His Name is the Name because it affords the means by which human beings share in the grace and love that is the nature of God himself\\" Cracknell, Kenneth (1985) p 29. His linguistic skill with the Biblical languages often disarmed critics, who saw his approach as a betrayal of Christian truth but who relied on English translations of the two testaments. Ariarajah says that \\"without denying any of the positive aspects of mission\\", Cracknell challenges Christians to re-think their attitudes to Others free from \\"prejudices stemming from the assumption of cultural superiority.\\" Ariarajah, op cit p 191 citing Cracknell (1995) p 93 where Cracknell refers to the relationship between colonial attitudes of superiority and the \\"legacies of earlier missionary theologies\\" as \\"one single sad tangle\\". Hugh Goddard refers to a \\"detailed study\\" of the Protestant World Missionary Conference of 1910 in Cracknell (1994) in which he \\"concluded that in some ways nineteenth century Christian thinking, including that of some missionaries, was readier than subsequent Christian thought to contemplate continuity rather than discontinuity between Christianity and other religions\\". \\"In that sense\\", says Goddard, Cracknell suggests that \\"under the influence of Barth and Kraemer the twentieth century has gone backwards rather than forwards.\\" Goddard, Hugh (2000) A History of Christian-Muslim Relations, Chicago, IL: New Amsterdam Books p 151 Cracknell was awarded his Oxford BD for this book. =Networking= Traveling widely throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, in Europe and beyond promoting interfaith dialogue and visiting situations where Christian found themselves compelled to think about their relations with the religious Other, Cracknell was concerned to learn from their experiences but to also challenge a narrow perception of the meaning of faith, which is always God's gift and never a human work. His own experience in Africa led him to view Western Christianity as too tied to cultural assumptions such as those of racial and civilizational superiority, from which it needs to be liberated. Ariarajah also praises Cracknell's exploration of the role of nations in God's purposes, when he asks if the cultures and faiths of all nations are not of value and worth, why did God permit their proliferation? Ariarajah, op cit page 215 refers to Craknell (1985) on \\"God and the nations\\" as an \\"illuminating study\\". Working within the member churches of the BCC and outside the churches, Cracknell networked groups of committed individuals from across the faiths, encouraging and nurturing the formation of interfaith encounter groups. Many later affiliated with the Interfaith Network for the United Kingdom, a body that was launched just after he left office. Cracknell developed close personal relations with leading members of the various faith communities in the UK. A defender of religious liberty, he also helped to establish INFORM, a state-funded bureau for information on New Religious Movements including some that tend to be demonized, such as Scientology and the Unification Church. =As Journal founder= Cracknell was founder-editor of the journal Discernment (from 1986 until 1990), which continued to be published through until 1998.Cracknell was succeeded as editor by Clinton Bennett, who had followed him at the BCC in 1987 Wesley House, Cambridge After 10 years at the BCC, Cracknell moved to Wesley House, Cambridge where he held the Michael Gutteridge Chair in Theology and was Senior Tutor, continuing at the same time to work closely with the interfaith desk of the World Council of Churches and other interfaith groups. During his tenure in Cambridge, Cracknell also served as President of the Theological Federation (1988 to 1995). In much of his writing, Cracknell drew on the scholarship of Wilfred Cantwell Smith whose approach allows Others to define themselves, resisting the temptation to impose preconceived assumptions such as that any claim to experience God outside of Christ must be false. He was succeeded at Wesley by Martin Forward who had directed interfaith relations for the British Methodist Church and who was also involved in the work of the BCC committee. Texas Christian University After eight years in Cambridge, he took a position as Professor of Theology and Global Studies (later appointed Distinguished Professor) at Brite Divinity School, Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas. At the same time, Cracknell's wife, Susan White, began teaching at Brite as well. While at Brite, he produced his reader on Wilfred Cantwell Smith, his book on World Methodism (as co-author) and his Good and Generous Faith as well as articles and reviews. Cracknell also oversaw a summer study abroad program for Brite students through Wesley House at University of Cambridge. He retired in 2007. He now lives in Vermont, where he operates a book shop called Sutton Books and continues to lecture and to lead seminars on interfaith relations at various Colleges and Universities.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on May 15, 1997. Plot At the beginning of the episode, Rachel gets upset when Bonnie ‚Äì Ross's new girlfriend ‚Äì starts listing all the places she's had sex. Phoebe comes in with some news: She found an old picture of her parents with a friend ‚Äì also named Phoebe Abbott, who lives on the beach in Montauk; Phoebe suggests the gang spend the weekend there so she can search for her father. Rachel is pleased to learn that Bonnie has to work and is therefore unable to attend. While waiting for Phoebe to come pick them up, Monica spots a couple walking arm in arm, and wonders if she will ever find a boyfriend again. Chandler says that if \\"worse comes to worst\\" he will gladly assume the boyfriend role ‚Äì a prospect Monica finds hilarious. He then spends the rest of the episode trying to prove to Monica that he is good \\"boyfriend material\\". Phoebe pulls up in the cab ‚Äì and with the news that one of her massage clients is letting them use his beach house for the weekend. They pull up to the beach house and discover it is raining and that the house has suffered some flood damage and is filled with sand. Phoebe then visits the older Phoebe, who is a realtor. Younger Phoebe wants to know everything about her parents, but older Phoebe says she unfortunately lost touch with Frank and Lily after high school. She has a suspicion that older Phoebe is lying about not knowing Frank's whereabouts, and steals a picture from the refrigerator. When older Phoebe cancels their dinner plans the next night, claiming to be out of town, Phoebe breaks into her house. The older Phoebe catches her, and tells her the truth: Not only does she really not know where Frank is but she is younger Phoebe's real mother. While Joey tries to get the gang to play strip poker to distract them from the rain, Rachel tries to paint Ross' toenails; they playfully wrestle for a bit. The gang finally decides to give in and play Strip Poker, but they cannot find any cards ‚Äì so they end up playing Strip Happy Days Game and strip Joey completely naked. While Monica and Rachel talk about the fact that Rachel is flirting with Ross, Rachel gets upset when Bonnie shows up and joins in the game. The next morning, Joey wakes up to find that the gang has buried him in the sand ‚Äì and built a mermaid out of sand around him, complete with large breasts. Ross and Bonnie come down together, much to Rachel's dismay. She ends up getting her revenge, though ‚Äì by convincing once-bald Bonnie to shave her head again. Ross is upset, especially when he learns it was Rachel's idea. He fights with Rachel and points out it was Rachel who ended their relationship. Rachel then says that she was just mad at him ‚Äì and she had never fallen out of love with him. When Ross asks if she wants to get back together, she replies that she does not know; she still cannot forgive him for what he did but feels something when she is with him, and they kiss. A talk with Joey and Chandler does not help Ross since he is still in love with Rachel; but he also really likes Bonnie and thinks it would be healthy to move on. The episode ‚Äì and the third season ‚Äì ends with Ross upstairs in the hallway. To one side is Rachel's bedroom; the other, his and Bonnie's room. He thinks for a moment, then picks a door and goes in, saying \\"Hi\\" to someone there. During the closing credits, Chandler persists in trying to prove he would be good boyfriend material by knocking on the front door and pretending to be a guy picking her up for a date. On his final attempt, he plays the part as Tim Conway's dwarf character, Dorf, resulting in Monica storming off to bed.

The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest. History The initial land grant and monies to establish the Augustinian priory were made by William de Lovetot in 1103. In 1187 Philip, the Canon of Lincoln Cathedral, gave the Worksop Bestiary, an illuminated manuscript that is now at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York. In the 14th century the Tickhill Psalter was produced by the prior, John de Tickhill. The priory was dissolved on the orders of Henry VIII on 15 November 1539. The property was granted to Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury on condition that the Earl should provide a glove for the right hand of the sovereign at the coronation. This tradition continues to this day. Over time most of the former monastic buildings were plundered for their stone, but the nave of the church was saved for use as a parish church, and the early 14th century gatehouse was used as a school. Extensive restoration and enlargements of the church began in the mid-19th century and continued through the 20th century. In mid-2017 a face was uncovered, carved into one of the Priory walls, during renovation works. The face was estimated to date back to the year 980 AD, but the wall was finished around 1260 AD. It may have been a felt stone that someone decided to decorate before it was lime-washed over.

The case has a tonal as well as an architectural function, mixing the sound of the pipes and projecting it forwards as a blended whole. The specification was drawn up by David Butterworth and is almost identical to that of St Mary's Church, Nottingham. The pipes, of which there are 1634, are of various materials ranging in tin content from 90% in the fa√ßade pipes to 20% for some flute stops. Copper and pine are used for other registers. With the exception of 24 small pipes in the pedal case, all the front pipes are speaking. The reed pipes are by Giesecke of Germany; the flues by Stinkins of Holland and Peter Collins; the cymbelstern is by Laukhuff, also of Germany. The console at the foot of the central display pipes is constructed of oak; the naturals are of hard ‚Äòblackwood' and the accidentals are white resin topped. The manual compass is of 56 notes; the pedal compass of 30 notes. The style of voicing and the general approach to its construction has origins in the 17th and 18th centuries, rather than the more familiar instrument to be found in England. The balance of stops is in keeping with classical registration and the ‚ÄòWerk-Prinzip' of the case is designed to project the sound into the priory building. For the mechanism of the key and pedal action, direct connection by trackers of thin wood are used to the control valves, giving the performer control over the attack and decay of each note. The stop action is electric. There are six pistons to each department and six toe levers for the pedal department. There are also eight general pistons. The organ was reconstructed in 1996 by Wood of Huddersfield. It was cleaned and regulated and the soundboards were reconstructed. The keys were renewed; Swell Octave 2 ft replaced with new pipework by Stinkens; Cymbelstern added; entire stop action (slider solenoids excepted) was remade with Alan Taylor solid state; sequencer added. *Great Organ *Principal 8 *Rohr Flute 8 *Octave 4 *Spitz Flute 4 *Quint 2‚Öî *Wide Octave 2 *Tierce 1 3/5 *Mixture III-V *Trumpet 8 *Tremulant *Cymbelstern *Swell Organ *Wood Gedact 8 *Spitz Gamba 8 *Principal 4 *Koppel Flute 4 *Octave 2 *Spitz Quint 1‚Öì *Scharf III ‚Äì V *Dulzian 16 *Schalmey 8 *Tremulant *Pedal Organ *Subbass 16 *Octave 8 *Subbass 8 *Wide Octave 4 *Mixture III *Sordun 32 *Fagot 16 *Trumpet 8 =Organists= * John Hilton Turvey c. 1840York Herald - 18 July 1840 * George Walker ???? - 1854Nottinghamshire Guardian - 6 April 1854 - 1861Nottinghamshire Guardian -19 September 1861 - ???? * F.

The Chi Machine was granted a patent by the Japanese Patent Office December 18, 1990 which is expired in 2010((ii) Duration of a patent right). The machine was originally known as Sun Harmony and later changed to Sun Ancon. In 1927, Katsuzo Nishi created 'The Nishi Health System', a series of six exercises, one of which (kingy≈ç und≈ç) was the basis for the motion of the modern day Chi Machine. This specific exercise of the body was adopted in the martial art of Aikido and known as \\"goldfish exercise\\". The concept for the original Sun Ancon Chi Machine device came from Japanese scientist Shizuo Inoue, Chairman of Japan's Oxygen Health Association, who studied the effects of oxygenation of the body for 38 years and believed that lack of oxygen in the body is a primary cause of disease.  Marketing and Classification  Skylite Industry in Japan collaborated with Hsin Ten Enterprise International (HTE), in Taiwan, who trademarked the name The Chi Machine after being given exclusive rights to distribute the machine by Inoue. The machine was sold through a mult-level network of distributors. The Sun Ancon Chi Machine holds US FDA approval as a Class 1 Therapeutic Massager, Regulation #890.5660 http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRsearch.cfm?FR=890.5660 Proprietary Name Chi Machine http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfRL/rl.cfm?lid=434877 and is registered as a medical device in Canada 66598, Australia L 81810 and Japan 02B 0694.  Clinical Trials  In June 2000, HTE contracted with Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia to conduct clinical trials focusing on secondary lymphedema and venous oedema of the legs. Results showed a reduction in test subjects' weight an average of 1.45 kg (approx 3 lbs) in 3 weeks.. The results showed that \\"After a three week treatment period there were statistically significant reductions in total leg volume and fluids, whole body extracellular fluid, weight and subjective leg symptoms.\\"  Controversy  HTE claims the Chi Machine oxygenates the body via \\"passive aerobic exercise\\", activating the lymphatic system, enabling detoxification, and aligns the spine due to the figure of eight motion caused by the specific oscillation of the machine. Other devices adopting the same principle have been developed. There is some controversy about the comparison between these similar device and the Sun Ancon Chi Machine distributed by HTE. Many of HTE's distributors claim that any variance from the unique specification of the original Chi Machine - 140 oscillations per minute, +/- 5 - will result in a swinging motion of the body that may negatively affect efficacy or may be harmful. Similar devices supplied by other manufacturers offer various alternative speed options and controls (along with added gadgets such as magnets or far infrared in some cases), claiming that weight, health condition, age and other individual characteristics determine the optimal speed. In Japan the original manufacturers, Skylite Industry, have produced a model with a lower speed of 120 oscillations per minute.

The walking clubs are called Frontwalkers. Activities Most Front Runners clubs host one or more weekly fun runs. Following a 30-year tradition, members typically gather afterwards at a local restaurant. Many of the larger clubs host social events such as potluck dinners and annual banquets; participate as a team in distance relays and international LGBT sporting events such as Gay Games, World Outgames, and EuroGames; and elect officers, have bylaws and a membership-dues structure. A growing interest in walking has led some Front Runners clubs to add \\"Frontwalkers\\" to their club name. Name variation There are three different spellings of the organization name: Front Runners, FrontRunners and Frontrunners. History The first FrontRunners club was formed in San Francisco in January, 1974 by Jack Baker and Gardner Pond. It started as an \\"introduction to jogging\\" group listed in the bimonthly publication of \\"Lavender U\\", which was organized to serve the gay and lesbian community. \\"Classes\\" such as creative writing, ballroom dancing, learning to play bridge, etc., were listed. Jack and Gardner were members of San Francisco's DSE Running Club and modeled the Lavender U Joggers after it. The group met every Sunday at 10AM at a different scenic location. In 1978, Lavender U ceased to exist and the then-leader of the Lavender U Joggers, Bud Budlong, held a series of reorganization meetings that resulted in the group renaming itself \\"FrontRunners.\\" The new name was inspired by Patricia Nell Warren's 1974 novel The Front Runner, about a gay track coach and a gay runner. Bylaws were written, dues were established, and the first election of officers was held in January, 1979. Several years later, the group changed its weekly run to Saturday at 9 AM at Stowe Lake in Golden Gate Park. The second FrontRunners club was formed early in 1980 when Malcolm Robinson, a runner and employee of New York Road Runners, organized a gay running club and modeled it after the FrontRunners. He called it FrontRrunners New York. Soon after, the Los Angeles Front Runners was formed. After the first Gay Games, held in San Francisco in 1982, many Front Runners clubs were organized throughout the United States and around the world. Patricia Nell Warren, known as \\"Patches\\" to her Los Angeles Front Runners family, frequented the Los Angeles runs and annual dinners held by the LA group and participated in the annual Christopher Street West parade as part of the LA Front Runners contingent during the 1990s, thanks to then- president Marty Freedman and then-executive board member Kevin and Don Norte. The International Front Runners was created and became a more formal body by drafting and adopting a mission statement and constitution at the Front Runners International Front Runner Forum in 1999. Clubs around the world There are over 100 Front Runners clubs worldwide, about half of which are in the United States. *Calgary Front Runners in Calgary AB Canada (originally named Alpine Frontrunners Club Calgary) running every Saturday @ 9 AM from the downtown Eau Claire YMCA and 3 seasons (except winter) Wednesdays @ 5:30 PM from the same location. *Chicago Frontrunners and Frontwalkers, inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1995. *San Francisco Front Runners, since 1974, LGBT Running and Walking Club Welcoming Everyone of All Abilities! *Front Runners New York, NYC‚Äôs LGBT running club.

Guinness World Records 2006, p. 76 that forms at the Lofoten archipelago in Nordland county, Norway between the Norwegian Sea and the Vestfjorden. It is located between the Lofoten Point () on the island of Moskenes√∏ya (in Moskenes Municipality) and the island of Mosken (in V√¶r√∏y Municipality).Maelstrom, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica on-lineThe Lofoten Maelstrom , University of Oslo, includes animation of the tidal current Moskstraumen is unusual in that it occurs in the open sea whereas most other whirlpools are observed in confined straits or rivers. It originates from a combination of several factors, the dominant being the strong semi-diurnal tides and peculiar shape of the seabed, with a shallow ridge between the Moskenes√∏ya and V√¶r√∏ya islands which amplifies and whirls the tidal currents. The Moskstraumen has been featured in many historical accounts, generally exaggerated. It is also popularly known as maelstrom ‚Äì a Nordic word (malstr√∏m/malstr√∂m) for a strong whirlpool which originates from the Dutch combination of malen (to grind) and stroom (stream). This term was introduced into the English language by Edgar Allan Poe in 1841, through his short story \\"A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m\\". Poe provides an alternative name for the whirlpool with the line: ‚ÄúWe Norwegians call it the Moskoestrom, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.‚ÄùEdgar Allan Poe, \\"A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m\\", Graham's Magazine, 1841. Retrieved 11/17/2010. Description and mechanism The Moskstraumen is located between the Lofoten Point of the island of Moskenes√∏ya (in Moskenes Municipality) and the small island of Mosken in V√¶r√∏y Municipality. It involves strong tidal currents flowing through the shallows between these islands and the Atlantic Ocean and the deep Vestfjorden, creating eddies and whirlpools, the largest one having a diameter of some and inducing surface water ripples up to in amplitude. The currents are about wide and suck in various small microorganisms, thereby attracting fish and fishing boats, which could be in danger even in modern times.Tom Kopel Ebb and Flow: Tides and Life on Our Once and Future Planet, Dundurn Press, 2007 , pp. 78‚Äì79 The flow currents are strongest around July‚ÄìAugust. They can be clearly seen from a plane or the nearby tall Lofotodden Hill on Moskenes√∏ya.Jules Brown The Rough Guide to Scandinavia, Rough Guides, 2003 , p. 374 There are regular tourist boat trips between Moskenes√∏ya and V√¶r√∏y.Maelstrom and coastal caves The Moskstraumen is created as a result of a combination of several factors, including tides, strong local winds, position of the Lofoten and the underwater topography; unlike most other major maelstroms, such as Saltstraumen, Gulf of Corryvreckan, Naruto whirlpools, Old Sow whirlpool and Skookumchuck Narrows, it is located in the open sea rather than in a strait or channel. Tides have an amplitude of about and are semi-diurnal at Lofoten, that is they rise twice a day; they are the major contribution to the Moskstraumen. Tides are combined with the northerly Norwegian Sea currents and with storm-induced flow to result in a significant stream, with a reported speed varying between the sources from about and above. Strong topographic enhancement of tidal currents: tales of the Maelstrom (extended version) This flow occurs at the significant depths of about . It then meets a ridge of only about Tom Garrison Essentials of Oceanography, Cengage Learning, 2008, p. 227 deep (40‚Äì60 m by other sourcesHistory of Flakstad & Moskenes, Lofoten Islands) at the chain of Moskenes√∏ya, Mosken and V√¶r√∏y islands that causes an upward movement and eddies around the island edges. In literature The maelstrom off Norway, as illustrated by Olaus Magnus on the Carta Marina, 1539. Illustration for Edgar Allan Poe's story \\"Descent into the Maelstr√∂m\\" by Harry Clarke (1889‚Äì1931), published in 1919. The Moskstraumen was described in the 13th century in the Old Norse poems Edda and remained an attractive subject for painters and writers, including Edgar Allan Poe, Walter Moers and Jules Verne. The Swedish bishop Olaus Magnus included the Moskstraumen into his detailed report on the Nordic countries and their map, Carta Marina (1539). He attributed the whirlpool to divine forces and mentioned that it was much stronger than the previously known Sicilian whirlpool Charybdis. Most other writers of the time believed that the Moskstraumen played an important role in the ocean circulation, but, given a large number of tales and lack of scientific observations, grossly overestimated the size and power of the phenomenon. The Moskstraum, referred to simply as the Maelstrom, was the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m\\" (1841), which brought the term maelstrom, meaning strong whirlpool, into the English language.The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories, 1991, p. 300 The Moskstraumen also features in the climax of Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and is mentioned by Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick.Herman Melville Moby-Dick Chapter 36, wikisource. A likely source of information on Moskstraumen for those writers was a fictional description of the Moskstraumen by Jonas Danilss√∏nn Ramus from 1715 which was translated into English and partly included into the 1823 edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Poe quoted Jonas Ramus and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica in his tale. The Moskstraumen is visited by characters in Liu Cixin's Death's End. Rosa Arciniega's 1933 Spanish-language dystopian novel Mosko-Strom: El Torbellino de las Grandes Metr√≥polis references the Moskstraumen. One of the first scientific descriptions of the Moskstraumen was presented by the Norwegian priest and poet Petter Dass in his poem \\"The Trumpet of Nordland\\" which included a versified topographical description of northern Norway. There he clearly related the whirlpool with tides by noting that it was the strongest at full and new Moon and the weakest at half-Moon. He also noted that since the large fjords of the Moskenes√∏ya had to be filled and emptied within 6 hours, the related water flow should create strong currents. Dass' novel was however not translated into English and remained unknown in Europe. The relation of the Moskstraumen with the tides was further mentioned by A. Schelderup in an article which was likely written in the 1750s and published in 1824.A.

The corner of Vitosha and Patriarch Eftimii boulevards, so called the Pharmacy (–ê–ø—Ç–µ–∫–∞), is a popular place for meetings. The boulevard is named after Vitosha, the mountain just next to Sofia. It was an unadjusted street during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria and acquired the name Vitoshka ulitsa (\\"Vitosha Street\\") after the Liberation, in 1883. The street was initially built up with low one-storey houses, but turned into an imposing trade street in the Interwar period as massive public buildings were constructed, changing Vitoshka's appearance completely. According to a 2007 Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. study, Vitosha Boulevard is the world's 22nd most expensive trade street. In May 2007 a renovation of the boulevard is announced, which should restore the style of 1930s Sofia. Historical benches and street lights are added, as well as Art Nouveau round kiosks, more green areas, fountains, open-air bars, as well as a clock tower at the St Nedelya Church displaying the time in various world capitals. In March 2013, reconstruction works on the boulevard have started. In summer 2015 there was another renovation of the boulevard completing the entirely pedestrian zone of the boulevard between Patriarh Evtimii Blvd. and Alabin Str.  Transport links  The north end of the pedestrian part of the boulevard is served by Serdika and Serdika II stations of the Sofia Metro as well as several tram lines, while the south end is served by NDK and NDK II metro stations and trolleybus lines.

Adams titled his autobiography after this composition. A two-CD retrospective album of works by Adams on the Nonesuch label is also entitled Hallelujah Junction, but does not include the composition. Composition The name comes from a small truck stop on US 395 which meets Alternate US 40, (now State Route 70) near the California‚ÄìNevada border. Adams said of the piece, \\"Here we have a case of a great title looking for a piece. So now the piece finally exists: the 'junction' being the interlocking style of two-piano writing which features short, highly rhythmicized motives bouncing back and forth between the two pianos in tightly phased sequences\\". The work centers around delayed repetition between the two pianos, creating an effect of echoing sonorities. There is a constant shift of pulse and meter, but the main rhythms are based on the rhythms of the word \\"Hal‚Äìle‚ÄìLU‚Äìjah\\". The work is in three unnamed movements, and generally takes about 16 minutes to perform. It was first performed by Grant Gershon and Gloria Cheng at the Getty Center in Brentwood, California, in 1998. It is dedicated to Ernest Fleischmann, long-time general manager of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In 2002 the composition was used for a ballet with choreography by Peter Martins.

She is a famously remembered freedom fighter who led an armed force against the British East India Company in 1824 in defiance of the doctrine of lapse to retain control over her territory, but was defeated in the third war and died in a prison. She was one of the first female freedom fighters to resist British colonisation, she is a national heroine well known in Karnataka and a symbol of the independence movement in India. Early life Kittur Rani Chennamma was born on 23 October 1778, in Kakati, a small village in the present Belagavi District of Karnataka, India. She belonged to the Lingayat community and received training in horse riding, sword fighting and archery from a young age. She married Raja Mallasarja of the Desai family at the age of 14. Fight to retrieve supremacy of Kittur from the British Chennamma‚Äôs husband died in 1824, leaving her with a son and a state full of volatility. This was followed by her son‚Äôs death in 1824. Rani Chennamma was left with the state of Kittur and an uphill task to save it from the British. Following the death of her husband and son, Rani Chennamma adopted Shivalingappa in the year 1824 and made him the heir to the throne. This irked the East India Company, who ordered Shivalingappa‚Äôs expulsion, on the pretext of the Doctrine of Lapse. This doctrine was based on the idea that in case the ruler of an independent state died childless, the right of ruling the State reverted or ‚Äòlapsed‚Äô to the sovereign. The state of Kittur came under the administration of Dharwad collectorate in charge of St John Thackeray of which Mr. Chaplin was the commissioner, both of whom did not recognize the new ruler and regent and notified Kittur to accept the British regime. Rani Chennamma sent a letter to Mountstuart Elphinstone, Lieutenant-Governor of the Bombay Presidency pleading her cause, but the request was turned down, and war broke out. The British tried to confiscate the treasure and jewels of Kittur, valued at around 1.5 million rupees. They attacked with a force of 20,797 men and 437 guns, mainly from the third troop of Madras Native Horse Artillery. In the first round of war, during October 1824, British forces lost heavily and St John Thackeray, collector and political agent, was killed in the war. Amatur Balappa, a lieutenant of Chennamma, was mainly responsible for his killing and losses to British forces. Two British officers, Sir Walter Elliot and Mr. Stevenson were also taken as hostages. Rani Chennamma released them with an understanding with Chaplin that the war would be terminated but Chaplin continued the war with more forces. During the second assault, Subcollector of Solapur, Mr. Munro, nephew of Thomas Munro was killed. Rani Chennamma fought fiercely with the aid of her lieutenant, Sangolli Rayanna, but was ultimately captured and imprisoned at Bailhongal Fort, where she died on 21 February 1829. Chennamma was also helped by her lieutenant Gurusiddappa in the war against British. Sangolli Rayanna, the army chief of Kittur Kingdom, continued the guerrilla war to 1829, in vain, until his capture. He wanted to install the adopted boy Shivalingappa as the ruler of Kittur, and Sangolli Rayanna gave a valiant fight using Guerrilla war fare for the first time. Britishers could not catch Rayanna in straight fights. Finally Rayanna's own uncle helped Britishers to capture him and he was caught and hanged. Shivalingappa was arrested by the British. Chennamma's legacy and first victory are still commemorated in Kittur, during the Kittur Utsava that is held between 22nd‚Äì24th of October every year. The three-day festivities include sports, cultural programs, and lectures by notable historians on the kingdom of Rani Channamma.

Cobb County School District, 449 F.3d 1320 (11th Cir. 2006), was a United States court case in Cobb County, Georgia involving a sticker placed in public school biology textbooks. The sticker was a disclaimer stating that \\"Evolution is a theory, not a fact, concerning the origin of living things.\\" The plaintiffs were parents of children in Cobb County schools who claimed the sticker violated both the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution and the separation of church and state clause in the Georgia State Constitution because its purpose and effect was to cast doubt on the scientific consensus regarding evolutionary theory in order to promote religious beliefs in the schools. Trial was held in November 2004. In January 2005, Federal District Judge Clarence Cooper decided in favor of the plaintiffs and against the Cobb County School District, finding the stickers violated both the U.S. and Georgia constitutions. He ordered a permanent injunction against schools from disseminating the stickers in the textbooks or any other form. The decision was appealed in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals which found that they could not assess the lower court case due to gaps and rampant confusion about the evidence apparent in the case record, thus preventing proper appellate review of the constitutional issues. The original decision, in May 2006, was remanded back to the lower district court for new evidentiary inquiry and factfindings. The case was ultimately settled out of court in favor of the plaintiffs.  Background  The statement \\"evolution is a theory and not a fact\\" has been used as a tactic by creationists and intelligent design advocates, causing confusion over the difference between how theory is defined and used in the field of science and how the term is used colloquially to signify \\"conjecture\\", \\"speculation\\" or \\"opinion\\". The teaching of both creationism and intelligent design in state schools in the USA have been challenged in court and found to be a violation of the Establishment Clause (notably Edwards v. Aguillard, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District). Those cases followed an earlier constitutional court ruling against religiously based bans against the teaching of evolution (Epperson v. Arkansas). In 1997 a school policy adopted in Louisiana requiring the reading of a prepared statement before any teaching of evolution was also judged as unconstitutional (Freiler v. Tangipahoa). Beginning in 1976 the Cobb County School District had policies in place requiring that their instructional program consider and accommodate for religious objections held by many of its residents to the science of human evolution. By 1995 the policy was expanded to list five requirements: :#Curriculum must be organized such that no student is compelled to study the origin of the human species in science :#No scientific study in the origin of the human species may be taught at the elementary or middle school level :#There may be no course requirement for the origin of the human species in science for high school graduation :#Elective course work must be available to students to investigate alternatives to the origin of the human species in science, including creationism :#These electives must be identified in course selection guides provided to students and parents This policy did not explicitly refer to the teaching of evolution by name‚Äîonly the origin of the human species. Although Georgia state law mandated evolution be taught in its public schools, it was common in Cobb County School District that all the pages where evolution was discussed were removed from the students' science textbooks. In 2001 the Cobb County School District began the process of adopting new science textbooks. The adoption process led to a legal review, and later revision, of the previous policy and regulation on theories of human origin. When parents became aware that the proposed new textbook (written by Kenneth Miller and Joseph Levine) and proposed changes to policy would strengthen the teaching of evolution, a petition against the move was organized and signed by 2,300 parents. In an attempt to defuse this protest, the decision was made to attach a sticker containing a statement written by the school district's legal counsel to each new textbook. The sticker read, The school board also adopted policy changes emphasizing its aim to \\"foster critical thinking among the students, to allow academic freedom consistent with legal requirements, to promote tolerance and acceptance of diversity of opinion, and to ensure a posture of neutrality to religion.\\" It was not its intention, the policy continued, to restrict the teaching of evolution, nor to promote creationism. The textbook and policy changes had become a public event, but despite engendering much input from parents and other concerned citizens in the community, no attempt was made to solicit expert scientific opinion in coming to a decision. Intelligent design activists from the Discovery Institute sent school board members written materials and an offer of assistance in drafting the language to put in the sticker, although no evidence was ever shown officials accepted this offer. Following adoption of the sticker, organizations, churches, academics and others from around the country contacted school officials congratulating them for opening the classroom to \\"the teaching and discussion of creationism and intelligent design\\". Parent Jeffrey Selman brought action against the school district for imposing the sticker on August 21, 2002, before any revisions to the 1995 policy were adopted. The plaintiff claimed the sticker unduly restricted the teaching of evolution by imposing separate standards from all other scientific theories. He also claimed the effective result was to advance creationism.Cobb County Disclaimer Goes to Trial National Center for Science Education, November 8, 2004 Changes were made to the 1995 policy shortly after and again in 2003 with new provisions stating evolution would be taught in science classes and not religion. Four other parents were added as plaintiffs in January 2004. Jeffrey Selman Jeffrey Selman was born in 1946 and raised in the Bronx, New York. He was strongly influenced by the civil rights era in the 1960s. After receiving a BA in history he joined VISTA which later became AmeriCorps. He became a school teacher in the South Bronx, then later a COBOL programmer and traveled until he met his wife in Atlanta and finally settled in Cobb County where he resides as of 2015. Selman served on the Georgia State Public School curriculum committee in 1996. He read an article in the Atlanta weekly alternative paper, Creative Loafing, about anti-evolution stickers in the new science textbooks in Cobb Public Schools, and first contacted the school board about his concerns. After feeling ignored by the school board, Selman contacted the ACLU. At the time his son was attending elementary school in the Cobb school system. After the trial he became the President of the Americans United for Separation of Church and State for Atlanta. Selman states that he was very upset when he read about what the Cobb County school board had done with the warning stickers on the science textbooks. He told interviewer Josh Zepps on Center for Inquiry's Point of Inquiry podcast that he felt strongly that in science class you are supposed to teach the science, \\"Whether or not you believe in it or understand it, is irrelevant. That's the topic so you should be taught the topic. ... You aren't going to teach French in a Russian class, the kids are there to learn Russian, not French. [These science teachers,] they were defining a definition that evolution was a theory and not a fact, and that is outside even the meaning in a science class.\\" A few years before Selman became aware of the warning stickers, he learned that the Cobb County School board, upon pressure from creationist parents, had contacted the school's textbook publisher regarding concerns of teaching elementary school students about evolution and the Big Bang. The publisher responded by blanking out the pages of their textbook that had chapters concerning these subjects. The publisher left the page numbers on these blank pages, and the index and table of contents still listed evolution and the Big Bang, but the pages concerned were blank. In 2015, Selman self-published God Sent Me, an autobiographical account of the case. He states, \\"I did not write the book for money... I got nothing out of it, its been ten years since the case happened. This is about spreading the word for people to have courage enough to stand up, as citizens to protect all of our rights... I'm not against religion, believe what you want to... I'm here to keep the government out of your religion... we are supposed to be a free country.\\"  Original decision  In the trial held to determine whether the sticker applied to the science textbooks was unconstitutional, the court examined the facts of the case against the three-prong test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman. Under the Lemon test, as it is commonly referred, a government-sponsored message violates the Establishment Clause if it fails any of the following: # The action must have a legitimate secular purpose; # The action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion; and # The action must not result in an \\"excessive entanglement\\" of the government and religion. In the resulting court decision the judge found that the action taken in Cobb County School District met the legal standard established in the first prong: > the court found that the School Board sought to advance two secular > purposes... ...to encourage students to engage in critical thinking... [and] > ...to reduce offense to those students and parents whose personal beliefs > might conflict with teaching on evolution. The judge merged the second and third prongs of the Lemon test to judge the actions taken by the school district under a single \\"effect\\" prong, and here judged those actions as failing to meet the standard set: > [T]he effects prong asks whether the statement at issue in fact conveys a > message of endorsement or disapproval of religion to an informed, reasonable > observer...In this case, the Court believes that an informed, reasonable > observer would interpret the Sticker to convey a message of endorsement of > religion. That is, the Sticker sends a message to those who oppose evolution > for religious reasons that they are favored members of the political > community, while the Sticker sends a message to those who believe in > evolution that they are political outsiders. This is particularly so in a > case such as this one involving impressionable public school students who > are likely to view the message on the Sticker as a union of church and > state. In support of this conclusion, the judge writes: > The critical language ... is the statement that \\"[e]volution is a theory, > not a fact, concerning the origin of living things.\\" This statement is not > problematic because of its truth or falsity, although testimony from various > witnesses at trial and the amicus brief submitted ... suggest that the > statement is not entirely accurate. Rather, the first problem with this > language is that there has been a lengthy debate between advocates of > evolution and proponents of religious theories of origin specifically > concerning whether evolution should be taught as a fact or as a theory, and > the School Board appears to have sided with the proponents of religious > theories of origin in violation of the Establishment Clause. The judge entered a permanent injunction against the sticker and ordered it removed from the textbooks. The school district motioned for a stay pending an appeal but were denied, and the stickers were removed.  Appeal and retrial  On May 25, 2006 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the trial court to resolve gaps in the evidence record, most notably evidence regarding the communications delivered to school officials prior to the district's adoption of the textbook sticker. The court agreed to a new trial. The plaintiffs utilized the same attorneys, Eric Rothschild and Richard Katskee of Pepper Hamilton, who had prevailed in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005. Settlement out of court On December 19, 2006, Americans United for Separation of Church and State announced that the case had been settled out of court in favor of the plaintiffs. Cobb County school officials will not order the placement of \\"any stickers, labels, stamps, inscriptions, or other warnings or disclaimers bearing language substantially similar to that used on the sticker that is the subject of this action\\" and would not undermine science education in the future.Americans United Applauds Settlement Of Georgia Lawsuit Over Evolution Disclaimer, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, December 19, 2006 The decision was hailed by the National Center for Science EducationA settlement in Selman v.

The feast fell in DecemberLang, Andrew. Magic and Religion, p. 142. and lasted about 12 days.\\"Zakmuk,\\" Probert Encyclopedia. It celebrates the triumph of Marduk, the patron deity of Babylon, over the forces of Chaos, symbolized in later times by Tiamat. The battle between Marduk and Chaos lasts 12 days, as does the festival of Zagmuk. In Uruk the festival was associated with the god An, the Sumerian god of the night sky. Both are essentially equivalent in all respects to the Akkadian \\"Akitu\\" festival. In some variations, Marduk is slain by Tiamat on the winter solstice and resurrected on the vernal equinox.Yule: A Celebration of Light and Warmth By Dorothy Morrison In Babylon, the battle was acted out at the royal court with the king playing Marduk, and his son-rescuer as Nabu, the god of writing. Once freed from the powers of the underworld, the king would enact the rite of the Sacred Marriage on the 10th day of the ceremony. During this rite, the king (or En, as he was known in Sumer) would perform sexual intercourse with his spouse, normally a high priestess who had been chosen from among the naditum, a special class of priestesses who had taken a vow not of celibacy precisely, but of a refusal to bear children. The high priestess was known as the entu, and her ritual act of intercourse with the king was thought to regenerate the cosmos through a reenactment of the primordial coupling of the cosmic parents An and Ki, who had brought the world into being at the dawn of Time. If an eclipse of the sun fell on any of the 12 days of the ceremony, a substitute for the king was put in his place, since it was thought that any evils which might have befallen the king would accrue to the substitute instead. On the last day of the festival, the king was slain so that he could battle at Marduk's side. To spare their king, Mesopotamians often utilized a mock king, played by a criminal who was anointed as king before the start of Zagmuk, and killed on the last day.

It is derived from the Latin term plenus (\\"full\\"). United States In United States constitutional law, plenary power is a power that has been granted to a body or person in absolute terms, with no review of or limitations upon the exercise of that power. The assignment of a plenary power to one body divests all other bodies from the right to exercise that power, where not otherwise entitled. Plenary powers are not subject to judicial review in a particular instance or in general. There are very few clear examples of such powers in the United States, due to the nature of the Constitution, which grants different, but at times overlapping, roles to the three branches of federal government and to the states. For example, although the United States Congress, under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (the Commerce Clause), has been said to have \\"plenary\\" power over interstate commerce, this does not always preclude the states from passing laws that affect interstate commerce in some way. When an activity is legally classified as interstate commerce, historically the states can regulate this type of activity as long as they do so within the bounds of their Constitutional authority.The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Commerce among the States. The Heritage Foundation, 2012. Congress does appear to have complete and absolute power regarding the declaration of war and peace in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11. Yet the President has control over the Armed Forces as Commander-in-Chief. These powers are in ongoing conflict, as seen by the War Powers Resolution of 1973. Another example of the ongoing debate over plenary powers in the U.S. Constitution is the controversy surrounding the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). This clause states that the Congress is allowed to \\"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and promote the general Welfare of the United States\\". How far this clause goes, and what it actually means in practice, has been hotly debated since the ratification of the Constitution.The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Spending Clause. The Heritage Foundation, 2012. While other Constitutional doctrines, such as the unenumerated powers of states and the rights of individuals, are widely held (both historically and currently) as limiting the plenary power of Congress,The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Reserved Powers of the States. The Heritage Foundation, 2012. then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist reflected that \\"one of the greatest 'fictions' of our federal system is that the Congress exercises only those powers delegated to it, while the remainder are reserved to the States or to the people. The manner in which this Court has construed the Commerce Clause amply illustrates the extent of this fiction. Although it is clear that the people, through the States, delegated authority to Congress to 'regulate Commerce ... among the several States' (Commerce Clause), one could easily get the sense from this Court's opinions that the federal system exists only at the sufferance of Congress.\\" (Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Association, 1981.) These conflicts over the definition of who or what retains which plenary powers have wide-ranging consequences, as seen in the example of United States v. Kagama, where the Supreme Court found that Congress had complete authority over all Native American affairs. =Statutes= The Congress may create and charter, through the enactment of statutes, corporate bodies (Federal Corporations) which can be granted (through the Congress' plenary power to legislate) derivative (derived from the legislation, as opposed to the Constitution itself) plenary power(s) in areas that are defined by statute and which comport with the constitution. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is an example of such an entity. It was created by the Congress as a Federal Corporation, and by statute, the TVA is given plenary authority over the setting the rates (prices) it will charge customers for the electricity that it generates. The Congress effectively gave the TVA plenary power over its generated electricity rate setting process by statutorily making TVA's rate settings exempt and immune from legal review by any process whatsoever, be it State, Federal or otherwise. Once the TVA Act itself was ruled constitutional, its rate setting process received its derivative plenary power. There is a difference in reach of plenary powers. While in the TVA example the Congress may at any time amend or remove TVA's plenary power to set the rates for the electricity it sells, the President's plenary power to pardon or commute those convicted under the laws of the United States is beyond the reach of the processes of the Federal Government, and requires the amendment of the U.S. Constitution, making it a truly plenary grant of power. =Presidential pardons= An example of a plenary power granted to an individual is the power to grant pardons for Federal crimes (not State crimes), which is bestowed upon the President of the United States under Article II, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution. The President is granted the power to \\"grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences (sic) against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment\\". That is, within the defined zone (e.g., all offenses against the United States, except impeachment), the President may reduce the punishment, up to the eradication of the fact of conviction and punishment, for offenses against the United States, entirely. Once done, the President's exercise of this power may not be reviewed by any body or through any forum; nor can this self-executing power (because it is self-executing), once exercised by a President, be reversed, or \\"taken back\\", by either the granting President, or any of his/her successors. Neither the power to grant pardon nor the power to construct the scope of a pardon (a commutation) is within the reach of any subsequent review or alteration. Furthermore, double jeopardy prohibits any subsequent prosecution for the offenses over which the pardon was granted. Even the President himself may not rescind a pardon that either he or a predecessor President has granted once such pardon is executed (i.e., once the official instrument is signed by the President and sealed on behalf of the United States). The President may also (as in the case of President Gerald Ford and the then former President Richard Nixon, as well as President George H. W. Bush and the former Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger) prospectively proclaim a grant of pardon. That is the President may proclaim the pardon of an individual, a group, a corporation, or any entity chargeable of offenses under Federal law, prospectively making the subject immune from Federal prosecution for past criminal acts. Such a pardon does this by destroying the possibility of a prosecution having a purposeful meaning or result. The rules of judicial procedure make such a future prosecution, or the continuance of an ongoing prosecution, moot. Thereby a motion for dismissal of an ongoing prosecution, or of an initiated future prosecution, is granted by a Court, on the grounds that the prosecution would be of no purpose or effect, and that it would needlessly waste a Court's time and the resources of an accused, who would only have the charges, for which a pardon had been proclaimed, dismissed anyway. =Immigration law= In regard to immigration law, Congress, under the Plenary Power Doctrine, has the power to make immigration policy subject to limited judicial oversight. The Executive Branch is charged with enforcing the immigration laws passed by Congress. The doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders. Courts generally refrain from interfering in immigration matters. Historically, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a hands-off approach when asked to review the political branches' immigration decisions and policy-making. The Center for Immigration Studies, an organization with a slant toward isolationism, suggests there is a movement to limit political-branch control over immigration in favor of a judge-administered system.Jon Feere, Plenary Power: Should Judges Control U.S. Immigration Policy? Center for Immigration Studies, February 2009. The U.S. Supreme Court case Zadvydas v. Davis is cited as an example of the U.S. Supreme Court not following plenary power precedent.Gabriel J. Chin, Is There a Plenary Power Doctrine? A Tentative Apology and Prediction for Our Strange but Unexceptional Constitutional Immigration Law.

It was the first strike against the TA; pre-TWU transit strikes in 1905, 1910, 1916 and 1919 against the then- private transit companies had all failed. There had also been some partial TWU strikes in the 1930s, but no citywide actions.The History of TWU on the site of the TWU. Accessed online 26 October 2007. The strike led to the passage of the Taylor Law, which redefined the rights and limitations of unions for public employees in New York.The history of the Taylor Law: How teacher strikes became illegal on the site of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT). Accessed online 26 October 2007. The strikers were led initially by the Irish- born Michael J. \\"Mike\\" Quill, the TWU's founder, who had been the union's president since its founding. The strike effectively ended all service on the subway and buses in the city, affecting millions of commuters. It was an ominous beginning for the mayoralty of John V. Lindsay, but is perhaps better remembered for the jailing of Quill and for his death only weeks afterwards. Chronology The twelve-day strike began on New Year's Day; the last trains rolled at 8:02 am. An injunction to end the strike was issued later that day, under the 1947 Condon-Wadlin Act. On January 2, the union reduced its economic demands, but the TA responded only by getting a judge's order for the arrest of Quill and eight other union leaders. (The others were Matthew Guinan, Frank Sheehan, Daniel Gilmartin, Ellis Van Riper, and Mark Kavanagh of the TWU and John Rowland, William Mangus, and Frank Kleess of the ATU). The arrests were set for 1 a.m. on January 4. Quill was obviously in ill health, but immediately before his arrest he told reporters at the Americana Hotel, \\"The judge can drop dead in his black robes. I don't care if I rot in jail. I will not call off the strike.\\" Quill spent little time in jail: his poor health soon had him transferred to Bellevue Hospital and later to Mt. Sinai Medical Hospital, leaving TWU Secretary-Treasurer Doug MacMahon (a close associate of Quill's, with him since the union's founding) to lead the strike. On January 10, 15,000 workers picketed City Hall. Negotiations moved forward through mediators, with movement from both sides. At 1:37 A.M. on January 13, MacMahon announced that the union was recommending settlement. The package, worth over $60 million, included wages increases from $3.18 to $4.14 an hour, an additional paid holiday, increased pension benefits, and other gains. Gains averaged nine percent for the next eight years. Quill's health at first seemed to be improving; he was actually released from hospital January 25. He gave a speech to the victorious strikers and another press conference at the Americana, but the apparent improvement in his health was an illusion: he died on January 28.McMahon and Siegel, p. 99. Context Democratic New York City mayor Robert Wagner granted collective bargaining rights to city employees in 1958. This led to the unions replacing Tammany Hall as the city's most powerful political force. Wagner formed a close alliance with the public- sector unions.McMahon and Siegel, p. 98-99. Reformist Republican John Lindsay won the November 1965 mayoral election by campaigning against the city's often corrupt political machines. With the transit contract set to expire the same day Lindsay would take office, the stage was set for confrontation. Lindsay's \\"Protestant rectitude\\" proved no match for the \\"fiery\\"City Hall Library Notes, March 2005; Spotlight on: Irish-American New Yorkers on the site of the New York City Government Department of Records. Accessed 24 December 2005. Quill. The true sources of power in New York became clear, a point that would be further driven home by 1967 and 1968 teachers strikes and a 1968 strike by sanitation workers. By the time Lindsay ran for re-election in 1969 as the candidate of the Liberal Party of New York, he had made his peace with the public sector unions, and ultimately won their support. However, and partly as a result, the city's social and economic decline was rapidly intensifying.

He is best known for the poems \\"Bivouac of the Dead\\", which is quoted in many cemeteries, and \\"The Old Pioneer\\". Early life Theodore O'Hara was born to educator Kean O'Hara and his wife in Danville, Kentucky on February 11, 1820. Afterwards, the family moved to Frankfort, Kentucky. He returned to Danville to go to Centre College and then continued his education at St. Joseph Academy in Bardstown, Kentucky, where he also served as a Greek professor during his senior year. He later studied law with future United States Vice President and Confederate Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge, and he was admitted to the bar in 1842. He decided to forgo law and went to journalism in 1845, just before being appointed for a position in the United States Treasury Department in 1845.Kleber, John E. Encyclopedia of Louisville. (University Press of Kentucky). p. 666.Bivouac of the Dead - Arlington National Cemetery Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War As the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War was beginning, O'Hara signed up for the U.S. Army on June 26, 1846. He held the positions of captain and quartermaster of volunteers under General Gideon J. Pillow as they advanced upon Mexico City, Mexico. For excellent conduct in the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco, O'Hara was honored with the rank of brevet-major on August 20, 1847. He was honorably discharged on October 15, 1848. After the war ended in 1848, O'Hara returned to Washington, D.C. to continue his law practices until 1851.Kleber, p. 666 Between Wars O'Hara was a firm believer in American expansion, in the form of filibustering. He joined others from Kentucky in an expedition to Cuba in 1850, after spending much of 1849 recruiting Kentuckians to the filibuster cause. Under the command of General Narciso L√≥pez, O'Hara commanded a regiment, with the rank of colonel, in the hopes of removing Spanish rule from Cuba. In the battle of C√°rdenas on May 18, 1850, he suffered a severe injury. After Lopez failed and died in his Cuba position in 1851, O'Hara returned to Kentucky, after fellow Kentuckians serving in Cuba took him with them as they escaped, returning to the United States at Key West, Florida.Kleber, pp. 666‚Äì667 O'Hara returned to journalism, first working for the Frankfort Yeoman of Frankfort, Kentucky, and then helping to found the original Louisville Times of Louisville, Kentucky in 1852, which became an organ for spreading Democratic Party propaganda. O'Hara left the Louisville Times in 1853 to join General John A. Quitman's filibuster expedition to Cuba. After Quitman's efforts failed, O'Hara attained a commission in the United States Army, was appointed captain of the Second Cavalry on March 3, 1855, and returned to Louisville as a recruiter for the Army. He was reassigned to Indian fighting on the prairies of Texas. On December 1, 1856, he was forced to resign by Robert E. Lee (then Lt. Colonel), as Lee brought up charges of drunkenness against O'Hara, and threatened him with court martial.Kleber 667 When John Forsyth Jr., editor-in-chief of the Mobile Register of Mobile, Alabama became minister to Mexico in 1856, O'Hara took his place in the newspaper. He continued to follow government orders, such as his diplomatic mission into the Tehuantepec grant debate. Civil War At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, O'Hara joined the Confederate army and became lieutenant colonel of the Twelfth Alabama Regiment. Then he would serve on the staffs of General Albert Sidney Johnston and General John C. Breckinridge, his fellow law student. He distinguished himself in the Western Theater of the War in Tennessee at the Battle of Shiloh and Battle of Stone's River. But conflicts with General Braxton Bragg and with President of the Confederate States of America Jefferson Davis hampered his military career and made his efforts to attain a regimental command futile. Legacy After the war, O'Hara went to Columbus, Georgia to work in the cotton business, but eventually he lost his business to a fire. He later lived on a plantation near Guerryton, Bullock County, Alabama, where he died. He was returned to Columbus for burial. On September 15, 1874, his remains, along with those of other Mexican War officers, were buried in the state cemetery at Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. His friend Sergeant Henry T. Stanton read \\"Bivouac of the Dead\\" at the reinternment and said, \\"O'Hara, in giving utterance to this song, became at once the builder of his own monument and the author of his own epitaph.\\" Lines from the poem would eventually grace the gates of numerous national cemeteries and several monuments of Confederate Dead. In particular, the first verse's second quatrain is often quoted: On Fame's eternal camping- ground Their silent tents are spread, And Glory guards, with solemn round, The bivouac of the dead. Because he served in the Confederacy, O'Hara often goes uncredited when the quatrain is used in non-Confederate settings. There is a dispute over when O'Hara wrote \\"Bivouac of the Dead\\". It is popularly thought to be written after the Battle of Buena Vista of 1847, where many Kentucky volunteers died. Others say it was actually written after the Battle of C√°rdenas in 1851. The New York Times wrote that it was first published in the Frankfort Yeoman in 1850, which puts it before O'Hara's Cuba adventures.Dixon, Susan Bullitt.

Founded in 1900, the company is headquartered in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. The firm has built many bridges in the U.S. and elsewhere; the Historic American Engineering Record notes at least 81.Historic American Engineering Record. The firm listed as the builder of a project is usually not the designer. In most cases, the bridge designer or building architect does not select the construction company, which is chosen by the owners/developers. The designer and the contractor work together closely to get the job done. American Bridge has also built or helped build the Willis Tower, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, launch pads, resorts, and more. During World War II, it produced tank landing ships (LSTs) for the United States Navy. History The Eads Bridge on the Mississippi River, the first major bridge built primarily of steel, was constructed by one of American Bridge Co.'s antecedents in 1874. American Bridge Company was founded in April 1900, when J.P. Morgan & Co. led a consolidation of 28 of the largest U.S. steel fabricators and constructors. The company's roots extend to the late 1860s, when one of the consolidated firms, Keystone Bridge Company, built the Eads Bridge at St. Louis, the first steel bridge over the Mississippi River and still in use. In 1902, the company became a subsidiary of United States Steel as part of the Steel Trust consolidation. The company pioneered the use of steel as a construction material; developing the means and methods for fabrication and construction that allowed it to be widely used in buildings, bridges, vessels, and other plate applications. It went on to do work across the nation and around the world. During World War II, the company built warships for the U.S. Navy. In 1944, American painter Thomas Hart Benton recorded the construction and launch of LST 768, producing numerous drawings and a painting, Cut the Line. The company went private in 1987 and was sold to Continental Engineering Corporation in 1988. The town of Ambridge, Pennsylvania, was an American Bridge company town (thus the name \\"Ambridge\\"), and is near their current headquarters of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. Both municipalities are on the Ohio River near Pittsburgh, with access to many steel suppliers, as well as to waterborne and rail transport, to allow shipment of components and subassemblies.

The Jewish Babylonian Aramaic title Mekhilta corresponds to the Mishnaic Hebrew term middah \\"measure,\\" \\"rule\\", and is used to denote a compilation of exegesis ( middot; compare talmudical hermeneutics). First mention Neither the Babylonian Talmud nor the Jerusalem Talmud mention this work under the name \\"Mekhilta,\\" nor does the word appear in any of the passages of the Talmud in which the other halakhic midrashim, Sifra and Sifre, are named.·∏§ag. 3a; ·∏≤id. 49b; Berachot 47b; etc. It seems to be intended, however, in one passageYer. Ab. Zarah 4:8 which runs as follows: \\"R. Josiah showed a Mekhilta from which he cited and explained a sentence.\\" The text quoted by R. Josiah can be found in the extant version of the Mekhilta, Mishpatim.ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, p. 106b It is not certain, however, whether the word \\"mekhilta\\" here refers to the work under consideration, for it may allude to a baraita collection, which might also be designated a mekhilta.Compare Pes. 48a; Tem. 33a; Gi·π≠. 44a, containing the sentence in question. On the other hand, this midrash, apparently in written form, is mentioned several times in the Talmud under the title She'ar Sifre debe Rav \\"The Other Books of the Schoolhouse\\".Yoma 74a; Bava Batra 124b A geonic responsumA. Harkavy, Teshubot ha-Geonim, p. 31, No. 66, Berlin, 1888 in which appears a passage from the Mekhiltaed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, p. 41a likewise indicates that this work was known as She'ar Sifre debe Rav. The first individual to mention the Mekhilta by name was the author of the Halakhot Gedolot.p. 144a, ed. Warsaw, 1874 Another geonic responsum refers to the text as the Mekhilta d ªEre·π£ Yisrael,Abraham Harkavy, l.c. p. 107, No. 229 probably to distinguish it from the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which was generally known in the Babylonian schools.David Zvi Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim, p. 36 Authorship The author or redactor of the Mekhilta cannot be definitely ascertained. Nissim ben JacobIn his Maftea·∏• to Shab. 106b and Samuel ibn NaghrillahIn his introduction to the Talmud refer to it as the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Yishmael, thus ascribing the authorship to Ishmael. Maimonides likewise says: \\"R. Ishmael interpreted from 've'eleh shemot' to the end of the Torah, and this explanation is called 'Mekhilta.' R. Akiva also wrote a Mekhilta.\\"In the introduction to his Yad ha- ·∏§aza·∏≥ah This Ishmael, however, is neither an amora by the name of Ishmael as Zecharias Frankel assumed,Introduction to Yerushalmi, p. 105b nor Judah ha- Nasi's contemporary, Ishmael ben Jose, as Gedaliah ibn Ya·∏•ya thought.Shalshelet ha-·∏≤abbalah, p. 24a, Zolkiev, 1804 He is, on the contrary, Ishmael ben Elisha, Rabbi Akiva's contemporary, as is shown by the passage of Maimonides quoted above.Jewish Encyclopedia article for Mekhilta, by Isidore Singer and Jacob Zallel Lauterbach The present Mekhilta cannot, however, be the one composed by Ishmael, as is proved by the references in it to Ishmael's pupils and to other later tannaim. Both Maimonides and the author of the Halakhot Gedolot, moreover, refer, evidently on the basis of a tradition, to a much larger Mekhilta extending from Exodus 1 to the end of the Torah, while the midrash here considered discusses only certain passages of Exodus. It must be assumed, therefore, that Ishmael composed an explanatory midrash to the last four books of the Torah, and that his pupils amplified it. (M. Friedmann, Einleitung in die Mechilta, pp. 64, 73; Hoffmann, l.c. p. 73 A later editor, intending to compile a halakhic midrash to Exodus, took Ishmael's work on the book, beginning with ch. 12, since the first eleven chapters contained no references to the halakhah.Friedmann, l.c. p. 72; Hoffmann, l.c. p. 37 He even omitted passages from the portion which he took, but (by way of compensation) incorporated much material from the other halakhic midrashim, Sifra, the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon, and the Sifre to Deuteronomy. Since the last two works were from a different source, he generally designated them by the introductory phrase, \\"davar a·∏•er\\" = \\"another explanation,\\" placing them after the sections taken from Ishmael's midrash. But the redactor based his work on the midrash of Ishmael's school, and the sentences of Ishmael and his pupils constitute the larger part of his Mekhilta. Similarly, most of the anonymous maxims in the work were derived from the same source, so that it also was known as the \\"Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael.\\" The redactor must have been a pupil of Judah ha-Nasi, since the latter is frequently mentioned.Compare Abraham ibn Daud in Sefer HaKabbalah in A. Neubauer, M. J. C., p. 57, Oxford, 1887, who likewise ascribes it to a pupil of Judah ha-Nasi. He cannot, however, have been Hoshaiah, as Abraham Epstein assumes,Beitr√§ge zur J√ºdischen Alterthumskunde, p. 55, Vienna, 1887 as might be inferred from Abraham ibn Daud's reference, for Hoshaiah is mentioned in the Mekhilta.ed. Weiss, p. 60b Abba Arika therefore probably redacted the work, as Menahem ibn Zerah says.In the preface to Zedah la-Derek, p. 14b Abba Arika however, did not do this in Babylonia, as Isaac Hirsch Weiss assumes,Einleitung in die Mechilta, p. 19 but in Palestine, taking it after its compilation to Babylonia, so that it was called \\"Mekhilta de-Eretz Yisrael\\". Quotations in the Talmud Barayata from the Mekhilta are introduced in the Babylonian Talmud by the phrases Tana debe R. Yishmael (\\"It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael\\"), and in the Jerusalem Talmud and the aggadahs by Teni R. Yishmael (\\"R. Ishmael taught\\"). Yet there are many barayata in the Talmud which contain comments on Book of Exodus introduced by the phrase Tana debe R. Yishmael but which are not included in the Mekhilta under discussion. These must have been included in Ishmael's original Mekhilta, and the fact that they are omitted in this midrash is evidence that its redactor excluded many of the passages from Ishmael's work.Comp. David Zvi Hoffmann, l.c. p. 42  Structure  The Mekhilta begins with Exodus 12, this being the first legal section found in Exodus. That this is the beginning of the Mekhilta is shown by the Arukh s.v. ◊ò◊û◊ê, and by the Seder Tannaim v'Amoraim.ed. S.D. Luzzatto, p. 12, Prague 1839 In like manner, R. Nissim provesIn his Mafteach to Shab. 106b that the conclusion of the Mekhilta which he knew corresponded with that of the Mekhilta now extant. In printed editions the Mekhilta is divided into nine \\"massektot,\\" each of which is further subdivided into \\"parshiyyot\\". The nine massektot are as follows: # \\"Massekta de-Pesah\\", covering the pericope \\"Bo\\" (quoted as \\"Bo\\"), Exodus 12:1‚Äì13:16, and containing an introduction, \\"petikta,\\" and 18 sections. # \\"Massekta de-Vayehi Beshalach\\" (quoted as \\"Beshallah\\"), Exodus 13:17‚Äì14:31, containing an introduction and 6 sections. # \\"Massekta de-Shirah,\\" (quoted as \\"Shirah\\"), Exodus 15:1‚Äì21, containing 10 sections. # \\"Massekta de-Vayassa,\\" (quoted as \\"Vayassa\\"), Exodus 15:22‚Äì17:7, containing 6 sections. # \\"Massekta de-Amalek\\", consisting of two parts: ## the part dealing with Amalek (quoted as \\"Amalek\\"), Exodus 17:8‚Äì16, containing 2 sections. ## the beginning of the pericope \\"Yitro\\" (quoted as \\"Yitro\\"), Exodus 18:1‚Äì27, containing 2 sections. #\\"Massekta de-Bahodesh,\\" (quoted as \\"Bahodesh\\"), Exodus 19:1‚Äì20,26, containing 11 sections. #\\"Massekta de- Nezikin,\\" Exodus 21:1‚Äì22:23. (see next) #\\"Massekta de-Kaspa,\\" Exodus 22:24‚Äì23:19; these last two messektot, which belong to the pericope \\"Mishpatim\\" contain 20 sections consecutively numbered, and are quoted as \\"Mishpatim\\" # \\"Massekta de-Shabbeta\\", containing 2 sections: ## covering the pericope \\"Ki Tisa\\" (quoted as \\"Ki Tisa\\"), Exodus 31:12‚Äì17 ## covering the pericope \\"Vayakhel\\" (quoted as \\"Vayakhel\\"), Exodus 35:1‚Äì3 The Mekhilta comprises altogether 77, or, if the two introductions be included, 79 sections. All the editions, however, state at the end that there are 82 sections.Compare I.H. Weiss l.c. p. 28; M. Friedmann, l.c. pp. 78‚Äì80  Aggadic elements  Although the redactor intended to produce a halachic midrash to Book of Exodus, the majority of the Mekhilta is aggadic in character. From the midrash was continued without interruption as far as , i.e. to the conclusion of the chief laws of the book, although there are many narrative portions scattered through this section whose midrash belongs properly to the aggadah. Furthermore, many aggadot are included in the legal sections as well. The halakhic exegesis of the Mekhilta, which is found chiefly in the massektot \\"Bo\\", \\"Bahodesh\\", and \\"Mishpatim\\" and in the sections \\"Ki Tisa\\" and \\"Vayakhel\\", is, as the name \\"mekhilta\\" indicates, based on the application of the middot according to R. Ishmael's system and method of teaching. In like manner, the introductory formulas and the technical terms are borrowed from his midrash.Compare D. Hoffmann l.c. pp. 43‚Äì44 On the other hand, there are many explanations and expositions of the Law which follow the simpler methods of exegesis found in the earlier halakha.Compare Midrash Halakha The aggadic expositions in the Mekhilta, which are found chiefly in \\"Beshallah\\" and \\"Yitro\\" are in part actual exegesis, but the majority of them are merely interpretations of Scripture to illustrate certain ethical and moral tenets. Parables are frequently introduced in connection with these interpretations e.g., \\"Bo\\" ed. Weiss p. 1b, \\"Beshallah\\" pp. 36a,b, 37a as well as proverbse.g., \\"Bo\\" p. 2b, \\"Vayassa\\" p. 60b and maxims.e.g., the apothegm of the ancient Zekenim, \\"Beshallah\\" p. 62b, \\"Shirah\\" p. 46b Especially noteworthy are the aggadot relating to the battles of the Ephraimites\\"Beshallah\\" p. 28b and to Serah, Asher's daughter, who showed Joseph's coffin to Moses,ib p. 29a besides others, which are based on old tales and legends. Some of the tannaim mentioned in the Mekhilta are referred to only here and in Sifre Numbers, which likewise originated with R. Ishmael's school.Compare D. Hoffmann l.c., pp. 38‚Äì39 On the earlier editions of the Mekhilta and the commentaries to it see I.H. Weissl.c., pp. 25‚Äì26 and M. Friedmann.l.c., pp. 12‚Äì14  English editions  * .

He is one half of a Los Angeles gay couple who have been together since meeting in high school in 1978. Don's initial desire to marry his high school sweetheart made headlines in a 1995 Los Angeles Times article when the couple expressed their desire to hop on a plane to Hawaii and then seek to enforce their marriage rights in California. The Times article was one of the first that documented the rise of Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA a year later. In 2008 The Advocate featured Norte's marriage to his spouse during the Summer of Love in 2008. Norte and his spouse were both Log Cabin Republicans during the campaign for marriage equality. Don Norte is credited with being one of the first openly gay Republican appointees to a governing body, when California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed him to the Governor's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. The Governor's Committee is charged with developing a comprehensive strategy to assist disabled youth and adults to enter the workforce by focusing on the needs and interests of the worker, the employer, and the community. Don's appointed position did not require Senate confirmation and the position did not receive a salary. Norte's term expired in 2010 after the advisory role of the Governor's Committee was switched by Governor Jerry Brown from the California Employment Development Department to the California State Department of Rehabilitation. In 2004, Norte was involved in the Bobby Shriver for Santa Monica City Council Campaign and was one of about 10 named prominent community leader endorsers in Shriver's campaign literature. Norte's career covers over twenty years of public service with Federal, State, and local government, including the US Defense Department and the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Norte holds a BA from Montclair State University in New Jersey, and master's degree from New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, where he studied under Professor Rae Zimmerman, among others. Don served on the Board of Directors and later as President of the California Public Parking Association. Don was employed by the City of West Hollywood's Department of Transportation and Public Works as Parking Services and Projects Officer for 27 years, and currently serves as Parking Manager for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Norte currently resides in Hollywood with his partner since high school, and now husband, Kevin. In 2009, Norte was named the Program Chair of CPPAs 25th Annual Conference and secured San Francisco Assemblyperson Fiona Ma as the Keynote Speaker. In 2010, both Norte and his spouse were co-hosts at a fundraiser for Democratic San Francisco Assembly person and Speaker Pro Tempore Fiona Ma for Fiona Ma's planned bid for the California Senate in 2014 (since then Ma was elected to the California State Board of Equalization representing the Second District.

Log Cabin Republicans Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) joined with the Schwarzenegger administration to actively recruit LGBT representatives in Sacramento. The inclusion of the LGBT community was significant in that the positions were launching points for both Republicans and Democrats. Log Cabin California Director James Vaughn made recruitment from LCR a top priority, and succeeded in recruiting the first openly gay Republican to serve on a visible political post in the Schwarzenegger administration. \\"This is part of our campaign to develop a farm team of candidates for public office √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú getting our members to be involved on state and local boards and commissions.\\"Don and his spouse were the only same sex couple to publicly endorse the Republican Schwarzenegger and were involved in the inauguration as a same sex couple in the program brochure The Nortes were sponsors of Log Cabin Republicans/Liberty Education Forum in Denver in 2007 and in San Diego in 2008 according to both program's booklets. The slightly right of center couple was also a table sponsor for Equality California's Gala Dinner in Los Angeles in the summer of 2008. According to a recent blog by Huffington Post blogger Ryan J. Davis, Davis flew out to Hollywood near the end of February to join a coalition of gay activists to lobby Gov. Schwarzenegger & First Lady Maria Shriver to publicly oppose the Family Research Council's Anti-Gay Marriage initiative. According to Davis, Norte's spouse, who was the organizer of the evening, wrote on The California Log Cabin blog, \\"Someone had to fire the first shot. We did. We had some powerhouses there and the message was clear. We were not going away.\\" As reported in The Huffington Post, the coalition had a broad base, including Matt Foreman (former Executive Director, The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force), Damon Romine (Former Entertainment Media Director, GLAAD), Geoff Kors (Former Executive Director, Equality California), Charles Robbins (Executive Director, The Trevor Project), John Duran (President, Equality California & City Councilperson West Hollywood), Charles Moran, the Log Cabin Republicans' former LA Chapter President and LCR-CA VP, 2010, James Vaughn (former LCR CA Director), and the organizers, Don Norte (Governor's Committee on Labor for People With Disabilities) and Kevin Norte (LCR California Member, and former LCR-PAC Board of Directors).

Context of same sex couples taking one name in California Norte tested California's \\"Domestic Partnership\\" law that promised equality except for the word \\"marriage\\" in 2005 by attempting to change his last name to test the applicability of AB 205. That law was intended to match the rights of domestic partnerships to married couples. The language provided in California Family Code ¬ß 297.5 (a), reads as follows: > Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights, duties, > protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same > responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether derived from > statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, > common law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and > imposed upon spouses. During the Legislative Session 2006‚Äì07, California AB 102 was drafted by San Francisco Assemblymember Fiona Ma after the Norte's legal name status was called into question after the CA DMV adopted a policy to intentionally block other domestic partners after the Nortes from applying the California Family Code in a similar manner. The Nortes' involvement was mentioned in the description of a George Takei interview on Larry King. AB 102 expanded on the concept of allowing domestic partners to take the name of a spouse, to include married couples so the husband would have the right to assume the last name of the wife. AB 102 was inclusive and consistent with Fam. Code ¬ß 297.5 by addressing marriages of different or the same genders. Name changes processed for domestic partners after AB 205 and prior to AB 102 originally permitted individuals to proceed with subsequent name change actions, including social security and passport documents. AB 102 passed the Assembly with three Republican votes: Sam Blakeslee, Roger Niello, and Anthony Adams. It passed the Senate on a straight party vote. The reaction from opponents was swift after the Governor signed the bill. \\"AB 102 allows homosexual couples to hold themselves out as married by permitting them to choose the same surname upon registration of their 'domestic partnership,'\\" said Randy Thomasson, president of Campaign for Children and Families. The bill granted unmarried couples married last names. \\"Schwarzenegger and the Democrat politicians have created the public image of homosexual \\"marriages\\" in California,\\" said Thomasson in response to the signing of AB 102. \\"It's hypocritical for Arnold Schwarzenegger to veto homosexual \\"'marriage'\\" licenses and at the very same time aggressively promote the public image of gay and lesbian \\"'marriages'\\" in every community for every child to see.\\" Nortes' position on their name was resolved in the 2006-07 legislative session when AB 102 was signed into law by the Governor because the law was made retroactive. End of activism During the last days of the 2012 Presidential election, when Log Cabin Republicans announced their last minute endorsement of Mitt Romney, Norte and his husband resigned from Log Cabin Republicans and changed their political affiliation.

In 1967, Watters was appointed Vicar General of the International Liberal Catholic Church and became bishop-elect in that church in 1970. He was drawn to the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch because of its willingness to ordain women. He was consecrated to the episcopate of the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch-Malabar Rite at Trinity Church in Santa Barbara, California on April 28, 1973, by Bishop Herman Adrian Spruit who was assisted by co-consecrators Bishop Stephan A.

For another park of the same name, see Idora Park, Youngstown. Idora Park was a Victorian era trolley park in north Oakland, California constructed in 1904 on the site of an informal park setting called Ayala Park on the north banks of Temescal Creek. Idora Park was leased by the Ingersoll Pleasure and Amusement Park Company that ran several eastern pleasure parks. What began as a pleasure ground in a rural setting for Sunday picnics evolved over time into the finest amusement park in the part of the San Francisco Bay Area. Popularity of the park declined after the advent of the automobile, and in 1929, Idora Park was razed. Idora Park, Oakland, 1910 History The Realty Syndicate constructed the park in 1903Bagwell, Beth (1982) Oakland, The Story of a City, Presidio Press, California, page 148, . on a site of Ayala Park that included an opera house, ranchlands and greenhouses on the north banks of Temescal Creek in North Oakland. Rodney Ingersoll erected the first figure eight \\"sky railway\\" on the site in 1903. Idora Park was leased by the Ingersoll Pleasure and Amusement Park Company that ran several eastern pleasure parks and originally the name was to be Kennywood Park (the name of an amusement park in Pennsylvania). It was reported that Mr. Ingersoll named the park after his daughter Idora, but there is some question about the name because of the park with the same name located in Youngstown, Ohio. That park was said to have been named either by a contest winner claiming, \\"I adore it!\\" or after a local Indian tribe. The Realty Syndicate also owned and operated what later became known as the Key System transit company, the Claremont Hotel and the Key Route Inn. Major partners of the company were Frank C. Havens and Francis \\"Borax\\" Smith, who earned his fortune in borax mining, subsequently investing it in transit, commercial and housing properties in the East Bay area. Located on the block bounded by Telegraph Avenue, Shattuck Avenue, 56th and 58th streets in the northern section of Oakland, Idora Park was famous for its opera house. Idora Park was a walled-in park, admission to the park was 10 cents, and it was open 30 or more weeks per year. A man named Bertrand York managed the park from 1911 until its razing in 1929. In the early 1900s, Idora Park was also the site of public demonstrations with lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air flying machines, including a balloon-launched glider flight by David Wilkie in a glider designed by John J. Montgomery on February 22, 1906. Idora Park also served as the location for the final construction of The California Arrow, a dirigible built by Thomas Baldwin in 1904. On August 3, 1904 the first successful round-trip flight of a dirigible in the United States was made by Baldwin with The California Arrow at Idora Park.Harwood, Craig S. and Fogel, Gary B. Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West, University of Oklahoma Press 2012. In the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, as many as 2,500 displaced people found shelter in Idora Park; food and relief supplies were provided by the Realty Syndicate, purchased from Capwell's Department Store.Bagwell, Beth (2012) Oakland, The Story of a City, Oakland Heritage Alliance, California, page 176, . After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, comic stars from the Tivoli Theater relocated to Oakland and renamed themselves the Idora Park Comic Opera Company. Shows like The Mikado, The Pirates of Penzance and The Wizard of the Nile were performed under the direction of Paul Steindorff in a wooden opera house called the Wigwam Theater. In 1919 when Oakland's own 159th Regiment returned from France, the park was opened to the fighting men at no charge. Rides Idora Park rides cost 5 cents. Many of the rides were advertised as being the \\"largest\\" or the \\"first.\\" * Circle swing - a large round flat disk or bench suspended by chains from a central pole, people could sit on the bench to swing * Social whirl - a platform inside a structure which people would sit on until the centrifugal force pushed them off * Barrel-of-fun * Trip through Hades * Helter Skelter - a slide type ride * Chutes * Miniature railway train - a small steam powered railroad that carried people through the park * Haunted swing * Ferris wheel * Touring cars * Circle wave * Flying swing - a swings (ride) with cars suspended from a central point that turned fast enough for the cars to become elevated * The tickler - appears to be a ride with a car on a twisting track * Merry-go-round * The mountain slide - appears to be a slide down through a mountain * Auto race course - a circular track where two full size, electrically powered automobiles, filled with people, would race each other to the finish Rides were renamed regularly, and one finds titles such as Dodge 'em, The Whip, Over the Top, Race through the Clouds, and the Magic Carpet. =Roller coasters= The park featured five traditional roller coasters during its history: * Ingersoll Figure 8 Toboggan, 1906-1916 * L.A. Thompson Scenic Railway, 1906-1921, (owned and operated by the Thompson Company) * Race Thru The Clouds, a twin track coaster, dates unknown * The Big (or Giant) Dipper, 1922-1928, John A. Miller designed at a cost of $60,000 * Skyrocket (or Thunderbolt), also designed by Miller, 1927-1928 Attractions Idora Park boasted the first outdoor public address system built by Magnavox, the first radio theater in the West, and a huge searchlight, and like many things at Idora Park, the searchlight was reputed to be the largest in the world. The evening light display used so much power that it outstripped the original capacity, and a new system had to be installed in 1907. Idora Park was a walled-in park that had a zoo, ostrich farm, animal shows, dance hall, racetrack, outdoor amphitheater, Japanese garden, bear grotto, main street called the Glad Way, Penny Arcade, photo gallery, and shooting gallery. In 1904 a ballpark with a 3000-seat double deck grandstand was erected, and after the 1906 earthquake, the Pacific Coast League relocated there. The park had the largest roller skating rink in California, the largest west of Chicago that rented clamp-on skates, a bandstand in its center, a mountain slide that sported a firework volcanic display on Saturday nights, and balloon ascensions where the acrobat team of Frank and Carrie Hamilton would parachute after their act. One attraction was The Laying Hens where participants threw a ball at a wooden hen sitting on a barnyard fence, and if it were hit, it fell over and delivered a hard-boiled egg to eat. The park offered electric souvenirs, ping-pong, musical arcade, dancing pavilion, roof garden and grill, lunch counters, open-air concerts, and numerous refreshment booths. Entertainment Vaudeville performers used Idora Park stages; famous stars who emerged from Oakland included Hobart Bosworth, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, and possibly Lon Chaney. It has been said that Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton improved their skating skills at the Idora Park skating rink described (in 1913) as the largest in the world. Something called the Cabaret de la Mort existed for a time. Jack London's daughter Becky describes trips to Idora Park with her father (link below). Aimee Semple McPherson held the largest outdoor baptism to date before 10,000 spectators in the swimming tanks after returning from the Far East following the death of her husband Robert James Semple. Refreshments Idora Park was famous for its crispy sour milk waffles (a recipe later published in the Oakland Tribune). Food at the park was available; ice cream, popcorn and Coney Island \\"Red Hots\\" were a nickel, whiskey a dime, Busch Beer from St. Louis was five cents. The park's restaurant featured full course meals for 75 cents to one dollar, and soda pop came in 12 ounce bottles. Demise Idora Park was eclipsed by the rise of the automobile and Neptune Beach in nearby Alameda. In 1929, Idora Park was razed, and a plan to develop the Central Square, an apartment and business complex, was announced. The depression interrupted these plans, and a variety of small storybook houses and worker housing apartment blocks were eventually constructed on the 17-acre site. In 1930 a new roller rink, Rollerland, was constructed facing Telegraph Avenue in the 5400 block.

Early life Joseph was born at Fisher's Mills, near Hespeler, now part of Cambridge, Ontario. He was the son of Octavius Augustus Seagram and Amelia Stiles, who emigrated to Canada from Wiltshire, England in 1837. His parents died when he was eleven leaving him and his brother Edward Frowde to be raised by clergy. For several years, Joseph lived at William Tassie's boarding school (now Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School) in the city of Galt (also now part of Cambridge). He studied for a year at Bryant & Stratton College business college in Buffalo, New York. Career He returned home where he worked for a time as a bookkeeper at a grist mill. Later, offered the opportunity to manage a flour mill (Granite Mills) in Waterloo, Ontario, he learned about the distilling process at Waterloo Distillery, a small aside to the George Randall Company's flour business, using extra grain stocks to make alcoholic beverages. In 1869, five years after joining the company, Joseph Seagram bought out one of the firm's three partners (George Randallhttps://uwaterloo.ca/library/special- collections-archives/exhibits/seagram-museum-library-collections/company- history) to become Seagram and Roos, then in 1883 became the one hundred percent ownerÔºàbuying out William Hespeler and William RoosÔºâand renamed it Seagram. Making whisky became the most important part of the business and Seagram built it into one of the country's most successful of its kind. His 1907 creation, Seagram's VO whisky, became the largest-selling Canadian whisky in the world. Seagram was the director of the Economical Mutual Insurance Company for several years. He was also known for his philanthropic activities including the donation of 13 acres of land for the construction of the Kitchener-Waterloo Hospital, a gift that was dependent on the facility being \\"open to everyone regardless of race color or creed.\\" in 1957 the Seagram distillery donated $250,000 to construct Seagram Stadium at the University of Waterloo. =Political life= He served as a Waterloo town councilor from 1879 to 1886. In the 1896 Canadian federal election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative Party member for Waterloo North. In the 1900 election he was acclaimed and was reelected in 1904, serving until September 1908 when he chose not to seek another term. He was a benefactor to the City of Waterloo. Among his donations to the community was a parcel of land occupied today by the Grand River Hospital. His gift specified that the property was to be used solely for hospital services and open to everyone regardless of race, colour or creed.City of Waterloo Crest and City of Waterloo Colours, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada at www.city.waterloo.on.ca =Thoroughbred racing= Seagram bought his first racehorse at the age of 16 and arranged to have it compete in races in Galt. He founded Seagram Stables in 1888, building its bloodlines by importing mares in foal from English sires. Between 1891 and 1898, his stables won eight consecutive Queen's Plates, Canada's most prestigious horse racing event. In total, during his lifetime Joseph Seagram won the race fifteen times, plus his heirs who took over the stable won it another five times. Joseph Seagram also served as president of the Ontario Jockey Club from 1906 to 1917 and in 1908 helped found the Canadian Racing Association. On its formation in 1976, the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inducted Joseph E. Seagram as part of its inaugural class in the builders category.

The United States military contracted with Stroukoff Aircraft Corporation to develop an improved version of the aircraft, combining features that the company had developed for the YC-123D and YC-123E. History =Stroukoff's work with the C-123= In 1956, Stroukoff had already gained much experience working on the C-123 Provider, having completed two contracts based on that airframe. Its YC-123D had introduced a Boundary Layer Control (BLC) system to the C-123B. This system forced pressurized air over the upper wing surfaces of the airplane, making the wing work as if it were flying at much greater airspeed. This greatly improved landing and take-off performance, gross weight capability, and lowered the C-123's stall speed. YC-123E with pantobase landing gear The YC-123E had been another experiment in improving the C-123's ability to operate wherever it might need to, introducing Stroukoff's own Pantobase system: two high-stress skis fitted to the lower fuselage, wingtip mounted floats, along with sealing the fuselage itself. This gave the YC-123E the ability to operate on water, as well as ice and snow, and with the BLC from the previous YC-123D, the new aircraft could effectively be operated from almost any runway surface available, and airstrips of shorter length. =The YC-134= The product of a US Air Force contract in 1956, a single C-123B from the -CN production block (serial 52-1627) was modified by Stroukoff Aircraft to become the YC-134. This aircraft was heavily modified with the following new features: *New Engines: The YC-134 was equipped with two Wright Turbo Compound R3350-89A radial engines, turning four-blade, thirteen foot Aeroproducts constant-speed fully feathering propellers. *Improved Control Surfaces: The YC-134's horizontal stabilizers were given endplates to improve directional stability. This gave the aircraft its distinctive three-tail look. *Improved landing gear: While the nosewheel from the C-123B was retained, both main gears were given a third wheel to improve weight distribution. *Fuel was no longer housed in the rear of the engine nacelles, but in an expanded center-wing fuel tank. In addition, two plumbed hardpoints for 550-gallon drop tanks were also added to each wing. *Stroukoff's BLC and Pantobase: the YC-134 was fitted with Stroukoff's own BLC and all three aircraft had they been delivered were to have been fitted with the Pantobase equipment designed for the YC-123E. These features gave an empty weight increase over the C-123B from to , and a maximum loaded weight increase from to . The aircraft's cruising speed was , compared to the C-123B's , and the YC-134 had a range with a payload. The BLC allowed the YC-134's take-off distance to decrease from to , very similar to that of the YC-123D. The U.S. Air Force, however, deemed that the YC-134 did not offer substantial improvement over the C-123, nor did it have a requirement for a piston-engined amphibious assault transport, and decided to purchase the Lockheed C-130 Hercules.

It first aired on 9 December 1963, during the first season. Introduction A cleaning lady attempts to vacuum up what appears to be a dust-bunny, but as soon as it is in the vacuum cleaner it explodes into a bizarre energy cloud and kills her. Opening narration Plot A security guard at the gates of NORCO, a southern California physics research center, is brusque when the Peters brothers drive up, even though Professor Stuart Peters has taken a job with the company, intending to have a look around the property. The guard orders them to leave, when oddly enough, he slips them a matchbook on which he has scrawled, \\"Don't come back, NORCO doomed\\". When the brothers drive away, a monstrous explosion of energy appears, and the guard, while pleading for his life, disintegrates. The next day at NORCO, Professor Peters meets his boss, head scientist Dr. Block, and mentions the note, which Block dismisses. Block leaves Stuart in the laboratory with a co-worker, Professor Stephanie Linden. Inquiring as to the nature of their work, Linden directs Stuart into an adjacent corridor and then locks him in, releasing a grotesque energy entity that kills him instantly. Days pass, and when Stuart does not return, his brother, Jory, grows worried, while confiding his concerns to his girlfriend, Gaby. However, when Stuart reappears, the two men quarrel over a family matter as Jory notices a strange device, apparently a heart pacemaker, strapped around his brother's chest. Stuart stumbles backward into the bathtub, where he is electrocuted. The pacemaker was thought to be defective by the authorities, but Peters had perfect health and the scar tissue is recent enough for a heart operation to have taken place since he arrived in California. The police investigate, and Sgt. Siroleo confronts Block at NORCO, who feigns ignorance to any wrongdoings at his facility and denies the allegations of complicity. However, it is Linden who reveals the truth: a being composed entirely of energy has been accidentally formed. It can consume anyone with a mere touch, and is so threatening that those who encounter it at close range die instantly. Dr. Block found a way to control the entity, and is keeping it contained while he tries to study the monster. When the other scientists demanded its destruction, Block had the horrid being frighten them to death, and then restored them to life with pacemakers, which will cease to function if Block directs the creature to draw the power from them. Jory arrives at the center in an effort to find the truth about what actually happened to his brother. Dr. Block then reappears in the lab with a gun and, holding Siroleo and Linden at bay, releases the horror. Siroleo, however, wrests away the gun and shoots Block. Now he, Linden, and Peters must face the energy being. Since the creature needs energy to sustain itself, they resort to cutting all power within a large area, thus forcing the being to withdraw back into the energy chamber where it has been contained. Unfortunately, this also causes Dr. Linden's pacemaker to fail, thus killing her. As things settle down, Peters and Siroleo turn around to look with uncertainty towards the energy chamber where the being has been quarantined ‚Äì now, once again, contained, but still powerful and alive.

History The Ram Island Ledges are a series of stone ledges, some of which break the waters at the southern end of Casco Bay, a short way south of Cushing Island. In 1855 an iron spindle was erected to protect sailors from these dangerous underwater ledges. The ledge continued to be the site of repeated shipwrecks. On February 24, 1900, the Allan Line steamship Californian (formerly named the State of California) ran aground on the ledge while en route from Portland to Glasgow, Scotland via Halifax, Nova Scotia. As a result of that accident, the United States Congress appropriated funds to build a lighthouse. Construction began on May 1, 1903, and was completed in 1905. It is a twin of the Graves Light off Boston. The lighthouse was built of granite quarried from Vinalhaven, Maine. The lighthouse originally included a third-order Fresnel lens. The lighthouse was electrified in 1958, and then automated in 1959. The light was converted to solar power in January 2001. The Ram Island Ledge Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Ram Island Ledge Light Station on March 14, 1988, reference number 88000157. In July 2010, Ram Island Ledge Light was put up for sale to the general public. The minimum bid was $10,000. The property had initially been made available at no charge to other government agencies, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations, but no interest was shown, so bids were opened to the general public. The winning bid, $190,000, came from a Windham surgeon.

It was a private town of Poland, owned by the families of Zbaraski and Moszy≈Ñski. Polish nobleman Piotr Stanis≈Çaw Moszy≈Ñski built a palace complex in Bershad. Only remaining parts of the complex are the park and the chapel of Moszy≈Ñski and Jurjewicz families. Former Moszy≈Ñski Palace in Bershad In 1648, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising under the Cossacks, Maksym Kryvonis conquered Bershad and slew many of the Catholics and Jews there. Before World War Two, the city had an important Jewish community.http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/he/research/ghettos_encyclopedia/ghetto_details.asp?cid=178 Bershad was famous in the middle of the nineteenth century for its Jewish weavers of the tallit, a ritual shawl worn by Jews at prayer. By the end of the century the demand decreased, and the industry declined, leading many of the weavers to emigrate to America. In 1900 the Jewish population of Bershad was 4,500, out of a total population of 7,000. The Jewish artisans numbered about 500. The community possessed synagogues and several houses of prayer. One synagogue survived World War Two and was not closed during Soviet times. It is still active. During World War Two, the Romanian forces under the direction of the Nazi Germans transformed the Bershad area into a ghetto. The city was part of the Romanian Transnistria Governorate. Many of the ghetto victims were not Jews from Bershad but Jews brought in from Bessarabia. Thousands of Jews were starved to death in the ghetto during the Holocaust including Bessarabian Hebrew writer and Yiddish poet Mordechai Goldenberg.http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Bukowinabook/buk2_073.html Many Jews worldwide bear a \\"Bershidsky/Bershadsky\\" surname referring to the town.

The location of the Maluku Islands in these charts was the reason of the dispute between Portugal and Spain: Reinel maps were used to support the claims of the crown of Castile to the spice-producing Molucca Islands, claiming that the Islands were located in their domains by the Treaty of Tordesillas. He has also produced maps of the west coast of Africa, the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic. Scholars think that Reinel, after getting into trouble in Lisbon in the early 16th century and fleeing to Spain, made the first map of the world.

After her death, he married the former Hallie Harrison in 1899. Carroll was a denominational leader both in the Baptist General Convention of Texas (of which he was a leading founder) and the Southern Baptist Convention. Much of his rise to prominence developed through proving himself a formidable foe in controversy - including debates with Texas politicians, standing for board policies and convention authority in the Hayden controversy in the Baptist General Convention, and opposing the president of Southern Seminary during the Whitsitt controversyThe Worst Decision B. H. Carroll Never Made: Southern Seminary, the Whitsitt Controversy & the Quest for Institutional AccountabilityThe Other Side of William Whitsitt at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. While Carroll had Landmark tendencies, he was not the champion of the Landmark Movement some have made him to be. Of the four major controversies involving Landmark ideas, Carroll sided against the Landmarkers in three of the four. Only in the Whitsitt controversy did Carroll side with Landmarkers and, for Carroll, that controversy was about trustee authority, not Landmark beliefs. Carroll's theology can best be described as moderately Calvinistic, postmillennial, and thoroughly Baptist. His postmillennialism was associated with neither the social engineering of Walter Rauschenbusch, nor the expectation that every soul in every community would be converted. Instead, Carroll held such a strong confidence in the work of the Holy Spirit, Christ's Vicar, that churches who accepted their role as God's instruments on earth would not ultimately fail in the Holy Spirit's mission to bring about the conversion of the vast majority of humanity, at which time Christ would return to fully institute His kingdom on earth.Carroll, \\"Interpretation of the English Bible-15,\\" 29-30.

He led in founding the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas in 1908, which moved from Waco to Fort Worth in 1910. He served as president of the seminary until his death. Carroll's younger brother, James Milton Carroll, was also an important Baptist leader in Texas. His son, B.H. Carroll Jr., would later become Tarrant County school superintendent and the namesake of the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, Texas. Carroll published 33 volumes of works, and is best known for his 17-volume commentary, An Interpretation of the English Bible. Benajah Harvey Carroll died November 11, 1914, and is buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in Waco, Texas. Southern Baptist conservative resurgence While Carroll was known for his expositional preaching and had agreed with the first article of the New Hampshire confession of faith, which said that the Scriptures contained \\"truth without any mixture of error for its matter,\\"Philip Schaff ed., The Creeds of Christendom: With a History and Critical Notes, 6th ed., ed. David S. Schaff (1931; repr., Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker, 2007), 3:742.; Benajah Harvey Carroll, Inspiration of the Bible, ed. J. B. Cranfill (1930; repr., Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, 1980). the doctrine of Scripture was not the most notable tenet of Carroll's theology and work. His work on the subject, inspiration of Scripture, was compiled and published posthumously by J. B. Cranfill in 1930. Beginning in the late-sixties and having its height in the late-seventies and early- to mid-eighties, the conservative resurgence looked toward Carroll as a foundation for their own arguments and as an example of the historic Southern Baptist position on the inerrancy of Scripture. Harold Lindsell extensively outlined Carroll‚Äôs position in one of his works. Lindsell also stated, \\"This volume [Inspiration] should be republished today and read by tens of thousands of Baptists so that they would better understand the theological roots from which they have sprung.\\" The year after Lindsell published those words, Thomas Nelson reprinted Inspiration, including two additional prefaces. One was by Paige Patterson, a leader in the resurgence and future successor to Carroll as president of Southwestern. The other preface was by W. A. Criswell, who in that preface saw the reprint as \\"timely,\\" and coming at \\"a crucial time in our history.\\"W. A. Criswell, foreword to Inspiration of the Bible, vii. Criswell had earlier served as a catalyst for the resurgence in his publication, Why I Preach that the Bible Is Literally True, in which Criswell had referred to Carroll.W. A. Criswell, Why I Preach that the Bible Is Literally True (Nashville, Tennessee,: Broadman 1969). Other members of the conservative resurgence also included Carroll in their defenses of the inerrancy of Scripture.Russell H. Dilday Jr., The Doctrine of Biblical Authority (Nashville, Tennessee: Convention Press, 1982), 100.; Richard Land, response to \\"A Brief History of Inerrancy, Mostly in America,\\" by Mark Noll, in The Proceedings of the Conference on Biblical Inerrancy, 1987 (Nashville, Tennessee: Broadman, 1987), 38.; L.

James and David S. Dockery, eds., Beyond the Impasse?: Scripture, Interpretation, & Theology in Baptist Life (Nashville, Tennessee: Broadman, 1992). The historian Joseph E. Early, Jr., assistant professor of theology at Campbellsville University in Campbellsville, Kentucky, maintains that Carroll had an overbearing, even \\"bullying\\", tendency and rarely failed to gain his way in matters of Baptist faith and practice. For instance, Carroll worked through the trustees to obtain the separation and removal of the seminary from Waco to Fort Worth in 1908, while Baylor president Samuel Palmer Brooks was away from the campus. He constantly quarreled with the editors of the Texas Baptist Herald even though the denominational newspaper published his sermons. He did not hesitate to remove erring churches from the denomination.Joe Early, Jr., \\"B.H.

It depicts the end of the outlaw gangs which operated freely during the closing days of the Twin Territories (Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory). The movie was directed by Bill Tilghman, noted Western lawman, and filmed by Benny Kent, a pioneer movie photographer and Tilghman's neighbor in Lincoln County, Oklahoma. Production Ingalls. Tilghman organized the Eagle Film Company in response to several movies which glamorized outlaws and depicted lawmen as fools. He intended to produce a movie that gave a realistic portrayal of outlaws and lawmen. The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws, while consisting of many actual events, contains several fictional people and scenes. One of the more famous fictional characters shown is Rose Dunn, the Rose of the Cimarron. Tilghman filmed on location at many of the old outlaw hideouts in Lincoln and Payne counties and in the old Creek and Osage reserves. He recruited local people, as well as cowboys from the 101 Ranch, to act in the film. He played himself, and also enlisted Deputy U.S. Marshals Bud Ledbetter and Chris Madsen to take part in the film. Arkansas Tom Jones (Roy Daugherty), the only survivor of the Doolin-Dalton Gang, also played himself. Reception Like many American films of the time, The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws was subject to city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors refused to issue a permit allowing the showing of the film because it featured the exploits of a band of train robbers and outlaws. Tilghman toured with the film, since he found as many people came to see him and his collection as came to see the film. Most of the film is available from the National Archives, although some of it is damaged and a couple of reels are missing. Companion book *Graves, Richard S.

Although the Irish Free State, later the Republic of Ireland, became independent in 1922, the title remained the same, rather than reflecting the region of Northern Ireland, which remains within the United Kingdom. The 1st Earl of Shrewsbury was created Earl of Waterford and Lord High Steward of Ireland on 17 July 1446 by letters patent of King Henry VI.Patent Roll, T.K., 24 Henry 6 The current Lord High Steward is his heir, the 22nd Earl of Shrewsbury. It was the Lord High Steward of Ireland, the Earl of Shrewsbury, who performed the responsibility of the curtana, and carrying the Sword of State at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.Preparing the Coronation, chapter by Sir Gerald W. Wollaston, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, in Elizabeth Crowned Queen - The Pictorial record of the Coronation, published by Odhams Press Limited, Long Acre, London, 1953 Four Swords of State are used, and the Lord High Steward of Ireland carries one of these, the Sword of Mercy, which has a blunt tip, and is called thus the Curtana. The others are the Swords respectively of Spiritual Justice, and of Temporal Justice, and the Great Sword of State, or the Sword of Offering. The Curtana is also known as the Sword of King Edward the Confessor. Contrast with Offices in England and Scotland The Lord High Steward of England ceased to be hereditary; for example it was conferred on the Duke of Northumberland for the Coronation in 1911. It is considered the first of the Great Officers of State, and a supreme judge in parliament. The Lord High Steward walks in front of the new Sovereign, carrying the Crown of St. Edward, on a velvet cushion. He wears robes of white satin and gold under-garment, with a long red mantle and ermine tippet. The Lord High Steward of Scotland is the Prince of Scotland, as Duke of Rothesay, who is also currently the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall. Given this Prince's other responsibilities, at the last two Coronations the Earl of Crawford was appointed as deputy to officiate in his stead. The Lord High Steward of Ireland is a hereditary position, vested historically in the Earl of Shrewsbury, but in other respects largely analogous to that of England, as determined by the Attorney-General in 1862. The historical background to that was the office of the Lord High Steward or Great Seneschal of Ireland granted to Sir Bertram de Verdun by King Henry II. LynchA View of the Legal Institutions, Honorary Hereditary Offices, and Feudal Baronies, established in Ireland following the reign of Henry the Second, deduced from court rolls, inquisitions, and other original records by William Lynch, Esq., Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, published by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, & Green, Paternoster Row, London, 1830. (See pages 75-79) devotes a detailed section of his book on feudal dignities to this office and hereditary title, and to its descent. The hereditary nature of the office BlackstoneCommentaries on the Laws of England, by Sir William Blackstone, (first published in 4 volumes over 1765-1769), London. (See section V. Offices, of Chapter 3 - Incorporeal Hereditaments, of Book 2) observes that there are offices, consisting of a right to exercise a public or private employment, along with the fees and emoluments thereunto belonging, that are also incorporeal hereditaments, i.e., heritable. Examples include certain royal offices, such as the Lord High Steward of Ireland. The holder may have an estate in them, unto him and his heirs. Other offices may be for life or for a term of years. In his work, Lynch devotes a chapter to such incorporeal hereditaments as \\"Honorary Hereditary Officers\\". He describes the dignity of Lord Constable conferred on Hugh de Lacy by original grant in 1185 of Meath. The Lord Constable of Ireland, originally vested with lands to which it was incident or annexed, and which descended through Walter's son Gilbert de Lacy to John de Verdun (ex jure uxoris Margaret) by virtue of his moiety of Meath (the other moiety descending to Geoffrey de Genneville, ex jure uxoris Matilda). By 1460, the lands to which it had been incident vested in Lord Theobald de Verdun's co-heirs in 1460, and, according to Lynch, the exercise of the office fell into desuetude. However, it can be seen elsewhere that the Lord High Stewardship continued to be inherited by the Earls of Shrewsbury. In Letters of Appointment dated 27 August in the 28th year of King Henry VI, the first Earl of Shrewsbury who was also the Lord High Steward or Great Seneschal of Ireland, appointed John Penyngton to be Steward of the Liberty of Waterford, and in such appointment, the Earl is described as \\"Senescallus ac Constabularius Hiberniae\\".House of Lords, Printed Evidence, 7 August 1855, no. 6, page 11 Further examples continue such as the case of the 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, confirmed in an inquisition later in 1624, and recalled in a Case before the House of Lords in 1862, dealing with the Lord High Stewardship of Ireland. Such appointments by the Lords Shrewsbury of Stewards of Counties in Ireland were upheld by the House of Lords as proof of the exercise of the prerogatives of the Lord High Steward of Ireland.House of Lords, Case (see below), sections on Proofs, page 12-13 Furthermore, it was in his inherited capacity as Lord High Steward of Ireland that the 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, George Talbot, assisted at the coronation of King Henry VII in 1485. The 12th Earl, in the same capacity as Lord High Steward of Ireland, assisted at the coronation of King James II in 1685. In both of these cases, the Lord High Steward carried the Curtana. Lapses in hereditary exercise of the office due to the Penal Laws From the time of King Henry VI, no English Monarch (except King James II and King William III during the civil war of 1690-2) was in Ireland until the visit of King George IV in 1821. There was therefore during that period few if any occasion where the Earls of Shrewsbury could have exercised the duties of their office as Lords High Stewards of Ireland, about the person of the Sovereign. As the Earls of Shrewsbury were at one time Roman Catholics, prior to Catholic Emancipation in Ireland, in 1829, they were prevented from effectively performing the judicial role of Lord High Steward. Hence, for example, in 1739, Lord Wyndham was eight times one of the Lord Justices of Ireland, and officiated as Lord High Steward of Ireland in the trial of Lord Santry for murder and treason, being the first trial of a Lord by his Peers in the Kingdom of Ireland.The Complete Peerage by G.E.C., by G.H. White and R.S. Lea, Volume XII, Part II, 880, under Wyndham. Baron Wyndham of Finglass surrendered the offices of Lord Justice at his own request in 1739 on account of his ill-health. The next trial of a peer was that of Nicholas, 5th Viscount Netterville, for murder in 1743, when Robert Jocelyn, 1st Viscount Jocelyn, (Lord Chancellor of Ireland) presided as the acting Lord High Steward. The same ceremonials as for the trial of Lord Santry were used, but the case collapsed at the outset because the two principal witnesses had died. When the assembled peers judged Lord Netterville therefore not guilty, the Lord High Steward broke the white wand and adjourned the House. The third case of a trial of a peer in Ireland by his peers was the trial of Robert, 2nd Earl of Kingston, in May 1798, for the murder of a Henry Gerald Fitzgerald, the illegitimate son of his brother-in-law. In the absence of witnesses for the prosecution, he was found not guilty, and the Lord High Steward thereupon broke his wand of office. On that occasion, the duties of the Lord High Steward were discharged by John FitzGibbon, the 1st Earl of Clare, who was also the Lord Chancellor of Ireland.In an earlier era, no less than seven Priors of Kilmainham, i.e., Knights Hospitaller, served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Another four Priors served as Lord Deputy or Lord Lieutenant - see The Knights of Malta, by H.J.A. Sire, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1994 (page 181) Resumption upon Catholic Emancipation It was only after the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 that John, the 16th Earl of Shrewsbury could take his seat in Parliament. Recognising the Earl's claim to the Lord High Stewardship, King William IV was pleased to respond to his petition and grant to the Earl the privileges inherent in the Lord High Stewardship, namely wearing the court uniform, and having access to the King's lev√©es by means of the private entr√©e, and of using the same upon other customary occasions. The same continuity of lineal succession and right was also upheld in the case of the Chief Serjeantcy of Ireland, when it was found that neither a period of adverse possession, nor \\"nonusor nor mysusor\\" was held valid against the legitimate and upheld claim of the lineal heir, Walter Cruise, of the first grantee, centuries later, as decreed and adjudged on 13 November in the fifth year of the reign of King Edward VI, and as recorded in Lynch's \\"Feudal Dignities\\". Hence, the Earl of Shrewsbury subsequently took his place, as Lord High Steward of Ireland, amongst the High Officers of State at the funeral of King William IV, when Queen Victoria also appointed him to carry the Banner of Ireland. Subsequently, his precedence over the Dukes of England as Hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland, was established in the Table of Precedency prepared in the Herald's Office and approved by Earl de Grey in his capacity as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1843; and similarly by the Earl of Eglinton as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1858. On 1 August 1862, the House of Lords made an Order.See Case on Behalf of Henry John Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford and Earl Talbot on his claim to the office of the Lord Steward of Ireland, lodged pursuant to the order of this Right Honourable House on the 1st Day of August, 1862, and based on favourable report to Queen Victoria by William Atherton, Attorney-General, on 11 March 1862 (see especially pages 8 and 9) to confirm the right of the then Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, and Earl Talbot, Henry John, to the Office of Lord High Steward of Ireland. White Wand of Office Sir John Talbot (born 1803) took part in the installation of the Prince of Wales as a Knight of Saint Patrick at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin on 18 April 1868. On 15 September 1871, Queen Victoria granted to Charles John Chetwynd-Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, etc. \\"that he and the heirs male of his body, being Lords High Steward of Ireland, may carry a white wand when appearing officially in Ireland and when attending State ceremonials, and be placed at such ceremonies according to the Office of the Lord High Steward of Ireland ‚Äù. Accordingly, and subsequently, a white wand was used at the Coronations of subsequent Kings Edward VII in 1902 and King George V in 1911, and a later Earl, John George Charles Henry Alton Alexander Chetwynd-Talbot carried a white wand at the Coronation of King George VI in 1937. The significance of the white wand can be found in its representation of the supreme judicial functions of the Lord High Steward, having been used by Baron Wyndham of Finglass in his interim capacity as acting Lord High Steward for the trial of Henry Barry, 4th Baron Barry of Santry. On that occasion the customary Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod bore a white one, instead of black, for the Lord High Steward. Lord Santry was pardoned, and fled to England where he died. Therein lies the significance of the white wand: it is a rod of office and the commission appointing a temporary Lord High Steward is dissolved according to custom by breaking the rod. This is also the customary practice for the Lord High Steward when operative in England (not being hereditary) . However, the Earl of Shrewsbury, holding the Lord High Stewardship on a hereditary basis, can retain the rod, and hence Queen Victoria's authorisation that it be used at State ceremonials. The white wand (or slat bhan) is also significant in the Gaelic/Brehon tradition of the inauguration of ancient Irish Kings. This is keenly observed in the inauguration of the O‚ÄôDonnell, Prince of Tyrconnell. The significance of the white wand was described by Geoffrey Keating:Foras Feasa ar Eirinn (The History of Ireland) le Seathrun Ceitinn, D.D. (by Geoffrey Keating, D.D.), edited with translation and notes by the Rev. Patrick S. Dineen, M.A., and published by the Irish Texts Society in 1906, and again in London in 1908, and re-printed in 1987 (); See Part III, containing the Second Book of the History, pages 10, 12 (as Gaeilge) or 11, 13 (in English). Keating (c.1570-1650), is believed to have completed this work in about 1634 It was the chronicler's function to place a wand in the hand of each lord [or king] on his inauguration; and on presenting the wand he made it known to the populace that the lord or king need not take up arms thenceforth to keep his country in subjection, but that they should obey his wand as a scholar obeys his master. For, as the wise scholar obeys and is grateful to his master, in the same way subjects are bound to their kings, for it is with the wand of equity and justice he directs his subjects, and not with the edge of the weapon of injustice. Equally, for the Barons in Scotland, the wand of officers of a Barony is also a white wand, associated with Chiefship, and originally with the scepter of the Scottish King (or Ard-Righ), indicating also that the Scottish feudal baron is also a chef de famille, who reigns within his circle.Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, volume 79: The Robes of the Feudal Baronage of Scotland, by Thomas Innes of Learney and Kinnaikdy, F.S.A Scot., Lord Lyon King of Arms, 1945 A glimpse of the historic roles of Lords Stewards or Seneschals can be obtained from the case of the inauguration of the O'Neill as Prince at Tullahoge. The O'Cahan would cast a gold sandal over the head of the O'Neill Prince elect, while the O'Hagan, Baron of Tullahoge, who was O'Neill's steward and justiciary for Tyrone, would present a straight wand, and then fasten the sandal to the Prince's foot . The Lord High Steward has also been known as the Great Seneschal of Ireland, as mentioned earlier. Seneschal was also the term used in Ireland to denote the Steward of a Prescriptive Barony,For example, as recorded in a deed made 1422 (9 Henry 5), lodged in Lib.GGG.24. at Lambeth, wherein the Earl of Ormond constituted James FitzGerald, Earl of Desmond, as his Seneschal of the Baronies of Imokilly and Inchicoin (Inchiquin), and the Town of Youghal or Manor (as the official would be called in England), before whom the Court Leet or view of frankpledge was held. More recently, the term Seneschal was also, apparently used to describe Donal Buckley, as the Governor-General of the Irish Free State in 1932. The Court of the Lord High Steward The Court of the Lord High Steward in England was first formally instituted in 1499 for the trial of Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick and confirmed by act of Parliament.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911 edition, see article on Lord High Steward. A precedent for the appointment of a deputy to execute in his place the duties of an Honorary Hereditary Officer of the Crown in Ireland is found in the licenseClose Roll, Tower of London 16 John; and Patent Roll, TL, 17 John, as per Lynch, op.cit. from King John in 1220 for John Marshal, to appoint a deputy to him as Lord Marshal,Lynch, op. cit., page 72 as well as in England/Scotland where the Earl of Crawford has deputised for the Lord High Steward of Scotland, who as Duke of Rothesay and Prince of Wales and Scotland had another role to attend to, namely as Heir Apparent. The precedent for the appointment by the Lord High Steward of Ireland of a deputy as steward of a county is found in the case of the appointment by letters patent on 27 August in the 28th year of the reign of the Plantagenet King Henry VI of England (circa 1450) by John, the 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, of John Penyngton, Esq., as Steward of the Liberty of Wexford. This was acknowledged in evidence in the case lodged pursuant to the order of the House of Lords of 1 August 1862. The precedent for such a deputy within the Court of the Lord High Steward to be also appointed on a hereditary basis is found in the cases of the Grand Almoner of England, who is the Marquess of Exeter, the Grand Carver of England who is the Earl of Denbigh and Desmond and the Grand Falconer, who is the Duke of St. Albans.Whitaker's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage, London, 1924 By precedent and analogy therefore, the Lord High Steward of Ireland has been able to appoint deputies, designated stewards or seneschals for counties, and on a hereditary basis. Although this prerogative has not been exercised during the period of the Penal Laws, nor later in the absence of visits of the Sovereign to Ireland, the Lord High Steward's prerogative remains intact, and has been invoked in some appointments in the 20th century.This has been confirmed in an advisory opinion of Learned Counsel issued by Edward F. Cousins, at Lincoln's Inn on 11 February 1992. Cousins is Chief Commons Commissioner and later also appointed by the Lord Chancellor as Adjudicator to HM Land Registry, since 13 October 2003. He was called to the Bar in 1971 (Gray's Inn) and is also a member of Lincoln‚Äôs Inn. He was appointed part-time Immigration Adjudicator and designated as a part-time Special Adjudicator in July 1999 and appointed as a Deputy Chancery Master in 2000. He continues to sit as a Deputy Chancery Master and also serves as a part-time Chief Commons Commissioner, to which he was appointed in 2002 Such appointments of deputies by Lords High Stewards (for example of Scotland or England) have been accepted in the past by the Court of Claims constituted at Coronations, most recently in 1953. The function of deputy to the Lord High Steward or Great Seneschal of Ireland is discharged under a related appointment of office, the Lord Steward for Tyrconnell, by letters patent of the Lord High Steward or Great Seneschal explicitly by virtue of the royal authority vested in him, to the grantee, and specifically to hold to him and his primogeniture heirs for ever.

Nike Skate Boarding won the 2020 Webby People‚Äôs Voice Award for Best Home/Welcome Page in the category Web. History In 1997, Nike commenced production of its own line of skate shoes, but was unable to sell to many specialist skate shops, as the market was already strongly in favour of companies such as DC, Globe, eS Footwear, Emerica, and Vans. Nike was not considered a core skate boarding brand among the Skate Boarding community and did not receive the necessary level of support. In 2002, Nike introduced the \\"SB\\" brand. The Nike SB Dunk Low model was released, featuring a padded tongue and collar, along with \\"Zoom Air\\" insoles; the shoe was more similar to other skate shoe styles than the corporation's previous attempts. After the SB Dunk's mediocre sales, Nike released four other models: The Nike SB Angus, Nike SB FC, Nike SB Delta Force, and Nike SB URL. In 2004, Nike SB signed Paul Rodriguez as a figurehead for the brand and recruited Lewis Marnell as the sole Australian team rider during the same period. In March of that year, Nike released the Nike Dunk SB collection, aimed towards skateboarders in California. The associated shoe designs differed from the previous SB Dunk range in that they were designed specifically for Skate boarders. The collection included increased padding, Zoom Air insoles, and enhanced material quality, including triple stitching, a standard for skate shoes. In 2005, Rodriguez released a signature shoe model named the \\"Nike SB Paul Rodriguez Zoom Air Low\\". That year, one of Nike SB's spokespersons Lance Mountain decided to release the Nike Blazer SB, a version of the Nike Blazer basketball shoe from the early 1970s. It was named the Nike SB Blazer and several new features were added, such as the padded collar and Zoom Air insoles. Mountain previously rode for Adidas and then joined Nike SB in 2007. Nike SB released its first video Nothing But The Truth in 2007 and held the premiere at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, U.S. The inaugural video production, directed by Lionel Goldstein, features the Nike SB team, with Marnell in the opening part and Rodriguez's part the conclusion of the video. In 2009, Eric Koston left Lakai Limited Footwear to join Nike and a video featuring the Nike SB amateur team, called Debacle, was released later in the year. In December 2011, the video SB Chronicles Vol. 1 premiered online, while premiere parties and free video showings were held throughout the world. The first volume of a two-part series features Stefan Janoski, Wieger Van Wageningen, Chet Childress, Daniel Shimizu, Youness Amrani, Marnell, Grant Taylor, and Clarke Hassler. In 2012, professional Sean Malto (riding for Girl) left Etnies for Nike SB, shortly after his 2011 street league skate boarding win. Flip rider Luan Oliviera was also added to the team and, in late June 2012, Nike SB announced its collaboration with Levi's and team rider Omar Salazar appeared in the promotional advertisements. In July 2012, Nike Skate Boarding opened a private training facility that had been constructed in Downtown Los Angeles, US. Entitled \\"6th and Mill\\", due to its location at the intersection of the corresponding street names (E. Sixth and Mill Streets), the official opening of the facility coincided with the launch of Rodriguez's sixth signature shoe with the brand. The training facility has featured heavily on The Berrics skateboarding website since its opening, with segments such as \\"First Try Fridays\\" (with professional skateboarder Theotis Beasley) and \\"Text Yo'self Before You Wreck Yo'self\\" (with professional skateboarder Chris Roberts) filmed inside the facility. In the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man, based on the comic book character, Andrew Garfield who portrays Peter Parker / Spider-Man can be seen wearing low-top Nike SB Dunks. The brand released a preview of Brian Anderson's first signature shoe model, entitled the \\"Nike SB Project BA\\", in February 2013. The Sneaker Report website explained that the \\"upper appears to be a two-piece construction with ample perforations for breathability.\\" As of mid-June 2013, the model has not yet been released. A promotional campaign, identified by the hashtag \\"#thelegendgrows\\", was launched by Nike to coincide with release of Koston's second signature shoe model the \\"Eric Koston 2\\" in March 2013. An advertisement that included other Nike athletes, such as Tiger Woods, and Koston's Nike SB teammates was filmed and a behind-the-scenes video was also published on the brand's YouTube channel. Koston used the Eric Koston 2 design as a basis for a limited edition golf shoe, named the \\"Koston 2 IT\\", and a corresponding launch was held in London, UK at the 1948 Stadium store in Shoreditch. The trailer for the video SB Chronicles Vol. 2 was published on the Internet in mid-June 2013. The second volume of the two-part series features Oliveira, Daryl Angel, Donovon Piscopo, Theotis Beasley, Justin Brock, Shane O'Neill, and Ishod Wair. Also in mid-June, Nike SB announced that Fucking Awesome Skateboards' Kevin Bradley and Skate Mental skateboards' Trevor Colden were the latest amateur additions to the team. In August 2013, Nike SB collaborated with Almost and TransWorld Skate Boarding magazine on a feature for amateur rider Youness Amrani. Entitled \\"Marrakesh Express\\", the project combined a print article with a video part that was launched on the TransWorld website on August 9, 2013. Videographer Chris Thiesson accompanied Amrani as he skated and traveled between \\"Casablanca and Marrakesh by way of Rabat, Kenitra, and Agadir\\" in Morocco. Amrani was born in Morocco, but grew up in Belgium. In early 2014. Amrani was promoted to professional status with his skate boarding deck company Almost, and attained professional status on the Nike SB team afterwards. Competitions In 2012, following Koston's recruitment as a team rider, a competition entitled \\"Mr. Control It All\\" was launched to coincide with the release of Koston's inaugural signature shoe model with the brand. Koston hosted the competition, alongside fellow team members, Sean Malto and Justin Brock, and it consisted of numerous missions, or challenges. For example, in \\"Mission 1\\", a different trick was performed by all three skate boarders and entrants were required to send in their edited footage in which they perform the same set of tricks. The entire competition was conducted on the internet, on sites such as YouTube, The Berrics and Nike's own skate boarding site. Special editions In addition to yearly releases, a variety of special edition Nike Dunk SBs have been released. The Nike Dunk SB Low Pro SB Tiffany was released in 2005 and, according to the Complex Sneakers website, was one of the brand's first designs to \\"drive nearly everyone crazy.\\" The Nike Dunk SB Tiffany design was also adapted by Nick Tershay, as part of Diamond, his skateboard/streetwear company.Other variations and collaborative releases with popular clothing brands made Nike SB popularity intensify. Brands like St√ºssy, Supreme New York, Staple Design, and Concepts all developed their own version of the Nike SB Dunk that became highly desired.The Nike Dunk SB Low Staple \\"NYC Pigeon\\" was also initially released in 2005 by Staple Design. The shoe made headlines of the New York Post because of a riot that started over the shoe and its release. On an interview with Jeff Staple owner of Staple Design, he stated \\"They were pulling kids off the gate and arresting them, and kids are holding onto the gate not letting go. Then it turned into a soccer match. Cops called higher level police, like SWAT, and some of the people who came to wait in line brought their own weapons. We saw machetes and baseball bats on the ground. It was crazy. It was just go to a store and buy shoes before that.‚Äù Nike SB made an impact on what is known today as sneaker culture, and in an article from Hypebeast, which says \\"the success of SB and my desire to have them to the cool color schemes which allowed us as a community to nickname each shoe and the coinciding box colors that signaled different eras\\" and with limited product and high demand it added more to the triumph of Nike SB at the time. For the biggest shoe of 2020, Nike partnered with Ben & Jerry‚Äôs.What Is a Chunky Dunky, and Why Is It $1,600?, GQ, 27 May 2020 The NIKE SB Dunk Low Chunky Dunky went on sale in May, it sold out immediately.

Marnell had released a Nike video part in the 18 months prior to his death‚ÄîNike SB's The SB Chronicles ‚Äì Vol. 1. Fellow Nike team riders, Rodriguez and O'neill published tributes on the Internet. Marnell's other Nike video parts are contained in Nothing But The Truth and Don't Fear The Sweeper. The Nike Skateboarding website featured a large photo of Marnell on its homepage and published the following tribute: > It is with great sadness and heavy hearts that we are to inform you of the > passing of our longtime professional rider friend, Lewis Marnell. A skater > who's incredible trademark pop could only be matched by the warmth of his > smile, Lewis was an amazing person both on and off his board and will be > truly missed.

Recognising the need for objective, empirical and comprehensive research on disarmament and security, the General Assembly specified that UNIDIR would be an autonomous entity within the United Nations structure, so that its work could be conducted in scientific independence.  Background  Through its research projects, publications, small meetings and expert networks, UNIDIR promotes creative thinking and dialogue on the disarmament and security challenges of today and of tomorrow. UNIDIR explores both current and future security issues, examining topics as varied as tactical nuclear weapons, refugee security, computer warfare, regional confidence-building measures, and small arms. Working with researchers, diplomats, government officials, non-governmental organisations and other institutions, UNIDIR acts as a bridge between the research community and United Nations Member States. UNIDIR's work is funded by contributions from governments and donor foundations. UNIDIR is based in Geneva, the primary centre for security and disarmament negotiations, home of the Conference on Disarmament, and global focal point for humanitarian concerns such as human rights, refugees, migration, health and labour issues.  Research Areas  In 2018, the Board of Trustees endorsed the organisation's following research agenda for 2018-2020: *Weapons of Mass Destruction and Other Strategic Weapons ‚Äî Reducing the risk of use of nuclear weapons; compliance and enforcement approaches and lessons; promoting habits of cooperation in WMD regimes; and space security and sustainability. *Conventional Arms ‚Äî Urbanisation of violence: adopting arms control to new environments; weapons and ammunition management: supporting country approaches; and arms control in prevention and peacemaking. *New Weapon Technologies ‚Äî Preventing, deterring, and responding to malicious cyber attacks, including the role of the private sector; and understanding the implications of increasing autonomy. *Gender and Disarmament ‚Äî Promoting dialogue and knowledge sharing to advance gender-responsive disarmament; and developing tools to apply gender perspectives in disarmament frameworks. *Middle East Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone ‚Äî Filling an important research gap related to how the issue of the ME WMDFZ has evolved over time, including lessons for current and future prospects.  Mandate  UNIDIR works on the basis of the provisions of the Final Document of the First Special Session of the UN General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament and also takes into account relevant General Assembly recommendations. The work programme is reviewed annually and is subject to approval by the UN Secretary- General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters, which also functions as UNIDIR's Board of Trustees. The Director reports yearly to the General Assembly on the activities of the Institute. UNIDIR's mandate is as follows: > The work of the Institute shall aim at: > (a) Providing the international community with more diversified and complete > data on problems relating to international security, the armaments race and > disarmament in all fields, particularly in the nuclear field, so as to > facilitate progress, through negotiations, towards greater security for all > States and towards the economic and social development of all peoples; > (b) Promoting informed participation by all States in disarmament efforts; > (c) Assisting ongoing negotiations on disarmament and continuing efforts to > ensure greater international security at a progressively lower level of > armaments, particularly nuclear armaments, by means of objective and factual > studies and analyses; > (d) Carrying out more in-depth, forward-looking and long-term research on > disarmament, so as to provide a general insight to the problems involved and > stimulating new initiatives for new negotiations. The Mandate is from Article II, Paragraph 2 of the Institute's Statute, which may be found here.  Management  All inner workings and research done by UNIDIR is supervised by a Board of Trustees and the Director. The Board also serves as the Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters. Each member must be knowledgeable in security, arms control and disarmament.

It was an Urban Development Corporation set up by the Government of the United Kingdom covering the entire borough and unitary authority of Thurrock in Essex. It handled large planning applications in the borough, and was part of the government's plan for urban expansion in the Thames Gateway. Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation opened for business in 2005 to drive economic growth in Thurrock, create homes, jobs and opportunities and make Thurrock a place where people want to live and work. The Corporation was given a target of creating 26,000 jobs and 18,500 homes in the borough and given the power to determine major planning applications to help achieve this. The Corporation encouraged and managed new projects and was committed to achieving growth and improvement in the Borough. It received annual government funding and was eligible to bid for more to support key projects, such as the development of Purfleet centre. It also worked to attract private sector investment in Thurrock. In 2007, following public consultation, it was planned for its remit to last until 2014.Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation lifespan extended, press release at Media-Newswire.com At the end of the premiership of Gordon Brown, there was an intention to merge the Corporation into the Homes and Communities Agency.

He published two strongly personalised critiques of London and Paris, and collaborated with Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, who considered his reports to be too subjective, but acknowledged him as the better writer. Early life Ian Nairn was born at 4 Milton Road, Bedford, England. Nairn's father was a draughtsman on the R101 airship programme based at Shortstown. The family moved in 1932 when the airship programme was terminated, and Nairn was brought up in Surrey. It was the balancing-act nature of this essentially suburban environment which he stated \\"produced a deep hatred of characterless buildings and places\\".Nairn, Ian and Pevsner, Nikolaus (1962) Surrey. Penguin Books. Nairn had no formal architecture qualifications; he was a mathematics graduate (University of Birmingham) and a Royal Air Force pilot, flying Gloster Meteor aircraft.The Man who Fought the Planners ‚Äì The Story of Ian Nairn, a filmed biography of Nairn shown on BBC4 in 2014.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQBBBj_1wwI The Architectural Review and \\"Subtopia\\" In 1955, Nairn established his reputation with a special issue of the Architectural Review called \\"Outrage\\" (later as a book in 1956), in which he coined the term \\"Subtopia\\" for the areas around cities that had in his view been failed by urban planning, losing their individuality and spirit of place. The book was based around a nightmarish road trip that Nairn took from the south to the north of the country ‚Äì the trip gave propulsion to his fears that we were heading for a drab new world where the whole of Britain would look like the fringes of a town, every view exactly the same. He also praised modernist urban developments such as the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham, which eventually became increasingly unpopular due to the subjugation of pedestrians to cars and was demolished in the early 21st century.\\"The Bull Ring\\" http://billdargue.jimdo.com/placenames-gazetteer-a-to-y/places-b/the-bull- ring/ Jonathan Glancey has compared Nairn's opinions with those of the town planner Thomas Sharp, as well as with earlier writers such as William Cobbett and John Ruskin, all of whom shared a vision of potentially invidious urbanization needing to be mitigated by clearly delineated rural space, \\"compact towns co-existing with a truly green countryside of which we are stewards, not consumers or despoilers\\".Glancey, J., What's so great about the Eiffel Tower ‚Äì 70 questions that will change the way you think about architecture, Laurence King Publishing, 2017, p.148. \\"Outrage\\" was followed by \\"Counter-Attack Against Subtopia\\" in 1956 (published as a book in 1957). Both books were influential on Jane Jacobs, who was then working at Architectural Forum, the most widely read US architectural magazine. Jacobs cited \\"Outrage\\" and \\"Counter-Attack\\" in The Death and Life of Great American Cities, and she recommended Nairn to her contacts at the Rockefeller Foundation, which funded Nairn's book The American Landscape: A Critical View (1965). The Buildings of England Nairn admired Nikolaus Pevsner's work (if not his methodology) on the then fledgling Buildings of England series, and had approached Pevsner in the early 1960s as a potential co-author. Pevsner, who wrote about \\"Visual Planning and the Picturesque\\", was influential on the formation of the Architectural Review's \\"Townscape\\" series of columns, which evolved into the movement to which Gordon Cullen and Nairn were key contributors. In common with several architectural writers and academics at the time, Nairn had already made small contributions to the series ‚Äì in his case the volumes on Essex, Norfolk and Northumberland. Pevsner in turn had been influenced by Nairn in earlier volumes: Rutland, for example, Pevsner described as having \\"no 'subtopia'\\".Pevsner, Nicholas (1960) The Buildings of England: Leicestershire and Rutland, Penguin, p.271 Nonetheless Pevsner was initially reluctant, having thus far written the guidebooks alone. He was also aware of Nairn's views on the 'house style' of the series from reviews Nairn had written on earlier volumes.Harries, Susie (2011). Nikolaus Pevsner: The Life, Random House, p.554. However the scale of the project began to demand assistance and Pevsner eventually handed almost all responsibility for writing the Surrey volume to Nairn, whose text ultimately constituted almost four- fifths of the finished volume. Pevsner was content to give sole authorship to Nairn for the volume on Sussex, but as work progressed Nairn felt that his approach was increasingly at odds with the relative objectivity Pevsner required. Nairn began to feel that this was acting as a constraint on his writing, and ceased work on the Sussex volume before it was completed. According to Pevsner, in the Foreword to the Sussex book, \\"When he (Nairn) had completed West Sussex, he found that he could no longer bear to write the detailed descriptions which are essential in The Buildings of England. His decision filled me with sadness....\\"Pevsner, Nicholas in Nairn and Pevsner (1965) The Buildings of England: Sussex, Penguin, Introduction, p.11. Consequently, the guide was published with Nairn being given credit for the West Sussex section and Pevsner East Sussex. In the Foreword to Sussex, Pevsner paid Nairn the compliment of acknowledging that \\"He writes better than I could ever hope to write.\\" However, he continues: \\"On the other hand, those who want something a little more cataloguey and are fervently interested in mouldings and such like, may find my descriptions more to their liking.\\"Nairn and Pevsner (1965), p.11. This contrast between exhaustive description (Pevsner) and passionate, sometimes emotional, enthusiasm (Nairn) is noted by Alec Clifton-Taylor in his review of Sussex in the Listener on 15 July 1965. \\"Dr Pevsner... is inclined to tell us everything about a building except whether it is worth going to see. Mr Nairn, more subjective, occasionally perverse... never leaves us in any doubt about this aspect.\\"Quoted by J. Meades, \\"Nairn & the Buildings of England\\", in G. Darley and D.McKie (eds) Ian Nairn ‚Äì Words in Place. Five Leaves Publications, 2013, p.64. Despite these differences, Nairn remained enthusiastic about the series after his association with it had ended. He later wrote, \\"For architectural information, there is nothing to beat The Buildings of England...\\".Nairn (1966) Nairn's London, Penguin, p. 14 Later career Nairn's style was more easily accommodated in his own architectural guidebooks, which he prefaced as being subjective and personal. Ultimately only two were ever published: Nairn's London (1966) and Nairn's Paris (1968). Planned guides to London's Countryside, The Industrial North, and Rome and Florence were announced but never appeared. Nairn's writing style is concise, and often humorous, and he describes both his loves and hates, sometimes describing a passage between buildings rather than the buildings themselves, or a single detail. An example of the former is Cardinal Cap Alley on London's South Bank: he remarked of its vista of a tower of St. Paul's, \\"an accident, but the kind of accident that tends to bestow if you design well in the first place.\\"Nairn, Ian (1966), p. 120 And of the latter: an elephant on the Albert Memorial \\"has a backside just like a businessman scrambling under a restaurant table for his cheque- book\\".Nairn (1966) p. 130. In addition to his journalism, Nairn became for a time a familiar face on television, producing various series called for the BBC, starting with Nairn's North in 1967 and concluding with Nairn's Journeys in 1978. He was fond of pubs and beer, and both his architectural guides and television journalism are full of descriptions of pubs, and recommendations of which beers to drink. He said in 1972 of a recently disused signal box in Longtown, Cumbria, that he could imagine it being turned into a house, with the lever frames left in place and converted to beer pumps. This was part of his love of local and regional distinctiveness, the \\"ordinary\\" places which attracted him as much as the locations of noteworthy buildings. In Nairn's Paris, for example, he lovingly describes the village of Quevauvillers, near Amiens, whose few features are \\"all lying around waiting for nothing to happen\\".Ian Nairn, Nairn's Paris, Penguin 1968, p.187. In a similar vein, in the small town of Pr√©cy-sur-Oise near Beauvais, he notes \\"a collection of ordinary things ('wobbly suspension bridge...grain silo...a sign saying Ruberoid') transformed into uniqueness\\".Nairn's Paris, p.177-8) (The reissued 2017 edition of Nairn's Paris omits these descriptions which appear in the chapters describing buildings in the wider Ile-de-France area such as Chartres, Reims and Beauvais c√©athedrals, the abbey church of Saint Martin des Bois, the town of Provins, several ch√¢teaux, and numerous hamlets and villages which Nairn deemed to be noteworthy, often, as in the case of Quevauvillers, because of their ‚Äì for him ‚Äì charming ordinariness.) When he did the Yorkshire section of Nairn's Journeys, he, in his own words, \\"bumped into\\" the great bluesman Champion Jack Dupree whilst doing a section of the programme in Halifax. The two got on rather well and maintained a close correspondence almost right up to his own death. In his concerns about the encroaching blandness of modern design, he was the heir of literary men who had similarly been critics of the spread of an Edwardian suburbia, such as E.M. Forster (\\"success was indistinguishable from failure\\" there), and John Betjeman (\\"red- brick rashes\\"), and which fed into the Campaign to Protect Rural England among others. This strain of thinking was, however, to become largely concerned with conservation of the heritage in affluent areas, rather than with Nairn's urban fringe. And like Betjeman, Nairn fought against the forces of subtopia, the obliteration of British heritage ‚Äì though the forces of subtopia invariably prevailed; one example, his defence of Northampton's Emporium Arcade ‚Äì \\"if they do pull this place down it'll be a diabolical shame.\\" It was demolished in June 1972. He died on 14 August 1983, aged 52, from cirrhosis of the liver and chronic alcoholism, four days before Pevsner himself died.Stamp, DNB. Consumed with a sense of failure, he sought refuge in drink and in his later years wrote almost nothing. He is buried in the Victorian Hanwell cemetery in west London. It is now in one of Ealing's conservation areas. Speaking in The Man who Fought the Planners ‚Äì The Story of Ian Nairn, Gillian Darley reveals that Nairn's death certificate erroneously gave the place of his birth as Newcastle upon Tyne. Although it is not known who supplied this information to the authorities, Darley reflects that it shows Nairn's wish to be considered a man of the North, a \\"Newcastle man by desire if not reality\\". Influence Writers and critics influenced by Nairn include J.G. Ballard, Will Self, Patrick Wright, Michael Bracewell, Jonathan Glancey, Iain Sinclair, Gavin Stamp, Owen Hatherley and Jonathan Meades, who said of his account of Surrey: In 1997 Michael Bracewell toured some of Nairn's subjects in Surrey for the Travels with Pevsner TV series. In the 2005 film Three Hours From Here Andrew Cross retraced the extensive journey across England that Nairn took to research and write Outrage in 1955. Jonathan Glancey undertook a similar odyssey for The Guardian in 2010. Fourteen of the buildings mentioned in Nairn's London, \\"one of the most strange and stirring books ever written about the city\\", form the basis of the \\"Building London\\" chapter in Henry Eliot and Matt Lloyd-Rose's Curiocity (2016). Nairn's own descriptions of buildings such as St Mary Woolnoth, Battersea Power Station and the Gala Bingo Club, Tooting are incorporated into short paragraphs which update Nairn and invite contemporary readers to see the buildings for themselves. The chapter forms an affectionate homage to the \\"cantankerous architecture critic\\".H. Eliot and M. Lloyd-Rose, Curiocity ‚Äì In Pursuit of London. Particular Books, 2016, p20-25.

Human cultivation and use of saffron spans more than 3,500 years and extends across cultures, continents, and civilizations. Saffron, a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativus), has through history remained among the world's most costly substances. With its bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, the apocarotenoid-rich saffron has been used as a seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine. The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was likely Crocus cartwrightianus, which originated in Crete or Central Asia; C. thomasii and C. pallasii are other possible sources. Although some doubts remain on its origin, it is believed that saffron originated in Iran (Persia). However, Greece and Mesopotamia have also been suggested as the possible region of origin of this plant. The saffron crocus is now a triploid that is \\"self-incompatible\\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction‚Äîall propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual \\"divide-and-set\\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation. If C. sativus is a mutant form of C. cartwrightianus, then it may have emerged via plant breeding, which would have selected for elongated stigmas, in late Bronze Age Crete. Humans may have bred C. cartwrightianus specimens by screening for specimens with abnormally long stigmas. The resulting saffron crocus was documented in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal, and it has since been traded and used over the course of four millennia and has been used as treatment for some ninety disorders. The C. sativus clone was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia, later reaching parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania. Global production on a by-mass basis is now dominated by Iran, which accounts for some 90% of the annual harvest. Etymology The word ‚Äúsaffron‚Äù immediately stems from the Latin word ' via the 12th-century Old French term safran. The French was borrowed from Arabic ÿ≤ŸéÿπŸíŸÅŸéÿ±ŸéÿßŸÜ (za'farƒÅn), and ultimately from Persian (zarparƒÅn) which literally means \\"golden leaves\\". The Latin form ' is also the source of the Catalan safr√†, Italian zafferano, but Portuguese a√ßafr√£o, and Spanish azafr√°n come from the Arabic az-zafer√°n. The Latin term crocus is certainly a Semitic loanword. It is adapted from the Aramaic form kurkema via the Arabic term kurkum and the Greek intermediate Œ∫œÅœåŒ∫ŒøœÇ krokos, which once again signifies \\"yellowish\\". The Sanskrit kunkumam might be ultimately the origin, or in some way related to the Semitic term. Minoan and Greco-Roman This inaccurate reconstruction of a Minoan fresco from Knossos in Crete depicts a man, which should be a monkey, gathering the crocus harvest. Crocus cartwrightianus is a species of flowering plant in the family Iridaceae, native to Greece and Crete. C. cartwrightianus is the presumed wild progenitor of the domesticated triploid Crocus sativus ‚Äì the saffron crocus. Saffron is the triploid form of a species found in Eastern Greece, Crocus cartwrightianus; it probably appeared first in Crete. An origin in Western or Central Asia, although often suspected, has been disproved by botanical research. Saffron played a significant role in the Greco-Roman pre-classical period bracketed by the 8th century BC and the 3rd century AD. The first known image of saffron in pre- Greek culture is much older and stems from the Bronze Age. A saffron harvest is shown in the Knossos palace frescoes of Minoan Crete, which depict the flowers being picked by young girls and monkeys. One of these fresco sites is located in the \\"Xeste 3\\" building at Akrotiri, on the Aegean island of Santorini‚Äîthe ancient Greeks knew it as \\"Thera\\". These frescoes likely date from the 16th or 17th century BC but may have been produced anywhere between 3000 and 1100 BC. They portray a Minoan goddess supervising the plucking of flowers and the gleaning of stigmas for use in the manufacture of what is possibly a therapeutic drug. A fresco from the same site also depicts a woman using saffron to treat her bleeding foot. These \\"Theran\\" frescoes are the first botanically accurate visual representations of saffron's use as an herbal remedy. This saffron-growing Minoan settlement was ultimately destroyed by a powerful earthquake and subsequent volcanic eruption sometime between 1645 and 1500 BC. The volcanic ash from the destruction entombed and helped preserve these key herbal frescoes. Ancient Greek legends tell of brazen sailors embarking on long and perilous voyages to the remote land of Cilicia, where they traveled to procure what they believed was the world's most valuable saffron. The best-known Hellenic saffron legend is that of Crocus and Smilax: The handsome youth Crocus sets out in pursuit of the nymph Smilax in the woods near Athens; in a brief dallying interlude of idyllic love, Smilax is flattered by his amorous advances, but all too soon tires of his attentions. He continues his pursuit; she resists. She bewitches Crocus: he is transformed‚Äîinto a saffron crocus. Its radiant orange stigmas were held as a relict glow of an undying and unrequited passion. The tragedy and the spice would be recalled later: For the ancient Mediterraneans, saffron gathered around the Cilician coastal town of Soli was of top value, particularly for use in perfumes and ointments. Herodotus and Pliny the Elder, however, rated rival Assyrian and Babylonian saffron from the Fertile Crescent as best‚Äîto treat gastrointestinal or renal upsets. Greek saffron from the Corycian Cave of Mount Parnassus was also of note: the color offered by the Corycian crocus is used as a benchmark in the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius and similarly with its fragrance in the epigrams of Martial. Cleopatra of late Ptolemaic Egypt used a quarter-cup of saffron in her warm baths, as she prized its colouring and cosmetic properties. She used it before encounters with men, trusting that saffron would render lovemaking yet more pleasurable. Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments: when stomach pains progressed to internal hemorrhaging, an Egyptian treatment consisted of saffron crocus seeds mixed and crushed together with aager-tree remnants, ox fat, coriander, and myrrh. This ointment or poultice was applied to the body. The physicians expected it to \\"[expel] blood through the mouth or rectum which resembles hog's blood when it is cooked\\". Urinary tract conditions were also treated with an oil-based emulsion of premature saffron flowers mixed with roasted beans; this was used topically on men. Women ingested a more complex preparation. In Greco-Roman times saffron was widely traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their customers ranged from the perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue. The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or deodoriser and scattered it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They used it as mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took saffron with them when they settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century. Middle Eastern and Persian Safranbolu, Turkey. Saffron-based pigments have been found in the prehistoric paints used to illustrate beasts in 50,000-year-old cave art found in modern-day Iraq, which was even then northwest of the Persian Empire. The Sumerians used saffron as an ingredient in their remedies and magical potions. Sumerians did not cultivate saffron. They gathered their stores from wild flowers, believing that divine intervention alone enables saffron's medicinal properties. Such evidence suggests that saffron was an article of long-distance trade before Crete's Minoan palace culture reached a peak in the 2nd millennium BC. Saffron was also honoured as a sweet-smelling spice over three millennia ago in the Hebrew Tanakh: According to the Talmud saffron was also among the spices used in the Ketoret offered in the Temple in Jerusalem.Babylonian Talmud Keritot 6a A field of saffron crocuses in Iran In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was cultivated at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads have been found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood to use as a body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia. East and South Asian The Gomateshwara monolith is anointed with saffron every twelve years by thousands of devotees during the Mahamastakabhisheka. Various conflicting accounts exist that describe saffron's first arrival in South and East Asia. The first of these rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to many experts that saffron, among other spices, was first spread to India via Persian rulers' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire. Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes. Once sold, Kashmiri saffron was used in the treatment of melancholy and as a fabric dye. On the other hand, traditional Kashmiri legend states that saffron first arrived in the 11th or 12th century AD, when two foreign and itinerant Sufi ascetics, Khwaja Masood Wali and Hazrat Sheikh Shariffudin, wandered into Kashmir. The foreigners, having fallen sick, beseeched a cure for illness from a local tribal chieftain. When the chieftain obliged, the two holy men reputedly gave them a saffron crocus bulb as payment and thanks. To this day, grateful prayers are offered to the two saints during the saffron harvesting season in late autumn. The saints, indeed, have a golden-domed shrine and tomb dedicated to them in the saffron-trading village of Pampore, India. However, the Kashmiri poet and scholar Mohammed Yusuf Teng disputes this. He states that Kashmiris had cultivated saffron for more than two millennia. According to Hindu religion Lord Krishna used to put Tilak (a mark on forehead) of Saffron daily. Ancient Chinese Buddhist accounts from the mula-sarvastivadin monastic order (or vinaya) present yet another account of saffron's arrival in India. According to legend, an arhat Indian Buddhist missionary by the name of Madhy√¢ntika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. Upon his arrival he seemingly sowed the first Kashmiri saffron crop. From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye. Some historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia. Saffron is mentioned in the ancient Chinese medical text Shennong Ben Cao Jing, believed to be from the 3rd century AD (but attributed to mythological emperor Shennong). Yet the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. The Chinese medical expert Wan Zhen wrote that \\"[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha\\". Wan reflected on how saffron was used in his time: \\"The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine.\\" In modern times saffron cultivation has spread to Afghanistan due to the efforts of the European Union and the United Kingdom. Together they promote saffron cultivation among impoverished and cash-strapped Afghan farmers as an ideal alternative to lucrative‚Äîand illicit‚Äîopium production. Post-Classical European Medieval European illuminated manuscripts, such as this 13th- century depiction of Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket's assassination, often used saffron dyes to provide hues of yellow and orange. Saffron cultivation in Europe declined steeply following the fall of the Roman Empire. For several centuries thereafter, saffron cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle the Iberian peninsula as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron corms to the region around Poitiers after they lost the Battle of Tours to Charles Martel in AD 732. Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors planted saffron throughout the southern provinces of Andalucia, Castile, La Mancha, and Valencia. In France, saffron cultivation probably started during the 13th century. Crocus sativus was likely introduced from Spain and from the Middle- East by pilgrims, merchants, and Knights. Its first uses are documented in the south-west of the Kingdom around 1250. It is indeed unlikely that Kings and Religious didn't try growing Crocus sativus by that time: Saffron was rare, expensive, and demanded, and Crocus sativus could be farmed under France's latitudes. By the 14th century, the wide use of saffron for spicing and coloring food is documented in recipe books such as the \\"Viandier de Taillevent\\", written by the King's cook. And by the 15th century, local saffron farming is attested with taxes levied by the religious power, which reveal how important saffron crops must have been. For instance, in 1478, the saffron tax levied by the Bishop of Albi reached 1/12th of saffron production. Saffron demand skyrocketed when the Black Death of 1347‚Äì1350 struck Europe. It was coveted by plague victims for medicinal purposes, and yet many of the farmers capable of growing it had died off. Large quantities of non-European saffron were therefore imported. The finest saffron threads from Muslim lands were unavailable to Europeans because of hostilities stoked by the Crusades, so Rhodes and other places were key suppliers to central and northern Europe. Saffron was one of the contested points of hostility that flared between the declining landed gentry and upstart and increasingly wealthy merchants. The fourteen-week-long \\"Saffron War\\" was ignited when one shipment of saffron was hijacked and stolen by nobles. The load, which was en route to the town of Basel, would at today's market prices be valued at more than 500,000. That shipment was eventually returned, but the wider 13th‚Äìcentury trade was subject to mass piracy. Thieves plying Mediterranean waters would often ignore gold stores and instead steal Venetian- and Genoan-marketed saffron bound for Europe. Wary of such unpleasantness, Basel planted its own corms. Several years of large and lucrative saffron harvests made Basel extremely prosperous compared to other European towns. Citizens sought to protect their status by outlawing the transport of corms out of the town; guards were posted to prevent thieves from picking flowers or digging up corms. Yet ten years later the saffron harvest had waned. Basel abandoned the crop. The pivot of central European saffron trade moved to Nuremberg. The merchants of Venice continued their rule of the Mediterranean sea trade, trafficking varieties from Sicily, France and Spain, Austria, Crete and Greece, and the Ottoman Empire. Adulterated goods also made the rounds: those soaked in honey, mixed with marigold petals, or kept in damp cellars‚Äîall to add quick and cheap bulk. Irritated Nuremberg authorities passed the Safranschou code to de-louse the saffron trade. Adulterators were thus fined, imprisoned, and executed‚Äîby immolation. England was next to have its turn as a major producer. One theory has it that the crop spread to the coastal regions of eastern England in the 14th century AD during the reign of Edward III. In subsequent years saffron was fleetingly cultivated throughout England. Norfolk, Suffolk, and south Cambridgeshire were especially affected with corms. Rowland Parker provides an account of its cultivation in the village of Foxton during the 16th and 17th centuries, \\"usually by people holding a small amount of land\\"; an acre planted in saffron could yield a crop worth a kingly 6, making it \\"a very profitable crop, provided that plenty of unpaid labor was available; unpaid labor was one of the basic features of farming then and for another two centuries.\\" In France, saffron production became very important in the 17th and 18th centuries, reaching a few tons. By then, saffron farming had spread throughout the entire Kingdom. Saffron was especially grown in Albigeois, Angoumois, Gascony, G√¢tinais, Normandy, P√©rigord, Poitou, Provence, and Quercy. Its mysterious decline started during the 18th century, possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops, to particularly cold winters, and to competing market from the Mediterranean countries. In England, cultivation persisted only in the light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of the north Essex countryside. The Essex town of Saffron Walden got its name as a saffron growing and trading centre; its name was originally Cheppinge Walden, and the culinary name change was effected to punctuate the importance of the crop to the townsfolk; the town's arms still feature blooms from the eponymous crocus. Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages, rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron's use and cultivation. Puritanical partisans favoured increasingly austere, unadorned, and unspiced foods. Saffron was also a labor-intensive crop, which became an increasing disadvantage as wages and time opportunity costs rose. And finally, an influx of more exotic spices from the far East due to the resurgent spice trade meant that the English, as well as other Europeans, had many more‚Äîand cheaper‚Äîseasonings to dally over. This trend was documented by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on many aspects of the saffron crocus. He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation over the course of the 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, did not help. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail. North American Saffron made its way to the New World when thousands of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to America‚Äîin a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold. However the War of 1812 destroyed many of the merchantmen that ferried American saffron abroad. Pennsylvanian saffron growers were afterwards left with surplus inventory, and trade with the Caribbean markets never recovered. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania Dutch growers developed many uses for the now abundant saffron in their own home cooking‚Äîcakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. Saffron cultivation survived into modern times principally in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

Early life and education He was the son of John Herring, rector of Walsoken in Norfolk, who had previously been vicar of Foxton, near Cambridge, and his wife, Martha Potts.http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=13098&back;= He was educated at Wisbech Grammar School and Jesus College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1710, graduating B.A. 1714, M.A. 1717. Having migrated to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1714, he was a fellow of Corpus Christi from 1716 to 1723, and graduated D.D. (comitia regia) in 1728.A biographical dictionary of America by the Rev. John L. Blake, 1788‚Äì1857] At Cambridge, he was an exact contemporary of Matthew Hutton, who succeeded him in turn in each of his dioceses. Career Herring became a close friend of Philip Yorke, the Solicitor General, who would later, as Lord Hardwicke, serve for many years as Lord Chancellor, and as such, was able to advance quickly. In 1727 he became a chaplain to King George II, in 1732 Dean of Rochester, and in 1737 he was appointed Bishop of Bangor, consecrated 15 January 1738. =Archbishopric of York= On 21 April 1743 he was translated to York and appointed Archbishop of York. On 23 September 1745, during the Jacobite rising, Herring gave a rousing sermon which, as Paul Langford notes, \\"captured the patriotic imagination as nothing previously had. It was to remain long in the collective mind of patriotic Protestantism.\\"Paul Langford, A Polite and Commercial People: England 1727‚Äì1783 (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 202‚Äì3. At a speech at York Castle on 24 September, Herring said: > ...these Commotions in the North are but Part of a Great Plan concerted for > our Ruin‚ÄîThey have begun under the Countenance, and will be supported by the > Forces of France and Spain, our old and inveterate, (and late Experience > calls upon me to add, our savage and blood-thirsty) Enemies‚ÄîA Circumstance > that should fire the Indignation of every honest Englishman.

September, the 22d, 1745: On > Occasion of the present Rebellion in Scotland (York, 1745), pp. 28‚Äì29. Horace Walpole said this speech \\"had as much true spirit, honesty and bravery in it as ever was penned by an historian for an ancient hero\\".W. A. Speck, The Butcher. The Duke of Cumberland and the Suppression of the 45 (Welsh Academic Press, 1995), p. 55. When Lord Hardwicke, the Lord Chancellor, repeated the speech's contents to King George II, the King ordered that the speech be printed in the Gazette. After Hardwicke enquired whether he should send Herring a message containing the King's admiration of \\"his zeal and activity\\", the King said this was not enough: \\"...you must also tell the Archbishop that I heartily thank him for it.\\"Speck, p. 56. Herring organised Yorkshire into resistance against the Jacobites by raising volunteers and money. According to Reed Browning, Herring's behaviour during the rebellion had demonstrated that he was \\"a resolute Whig, a brave Briton, and a commanding prelate.\\"Reed Browning, 'Thomas Herring, the Court Whig as Pastor', Political and Constitutional Ideas of the Court Whigs (Louisiana State University Press, 1982) p. 90. Herring supported the Walpoleon Whigs because he viewed the Protestant Succession embodied in the House of Hanover as essential to Britain: \\"Let us remember that, next under God, Union at Home, and Loyalty and Affection to the King and his Royal Family, are our great and sure Defence.\\"Browning, p. 100. He was also deeply suspicious of France as a Roman Catholic nation and a threat to the British nation.Browning, pp. 104‚Äì5. =Archbishopric of Canterbury= On 21 Oct 1747, he was nominated as Archbishop of Canterbury. There he generally followed the lead of his friend the Lord Chancellor, and frequently came into disputes with the Duke of Newcastle, the Secretary of State. Herring, like his immediate predecessor, had taken a generally Hanoverian side through the Bangorian controversy and stood against the convocation. Herring is generally credited as being the author of \\"A New Form of Common Prayer\\", published anonymously in 1753 in response to John Jones' \\"Candid Disquisitions\\" (1749). However, as a conciliator he eschewed controversy and rejoiced that he was \\"called up to this high station, at a time, when spite, and rancour, and bitterness of spirit are out of countenance; when we breathe the benign and comfortable air of liberty and toleration.\\"Letter to William Duncombe, quoted by E. Carpenter in \\"Cantuar\\" p243 -Mowbray, Oxford, 1988. He died in 1757 and was buried in Croydon Minster in Surrey. Notes Further reading *R.

The basis of the test is the ability of H. pylori to secrete the urease enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Process The test is performed at the time of gastroscopy. A biopsy of mucosa is taken from the antrum of the stomach, and is placed into a medium containing urea and an indicator such as phenol red. The urease produced by H. pylori hydrolyzes urea to ammonia, which raises the pH of the medium, and changes the color of the specimen from yellow (NEGATIVE) to red (POSITIVE). Among different kinds of rapid urease tests (liquid-based, gel-based, dry cool) there is a design type with single-layer sensitive element ‚Äî a layer impregnated simultaneously with urea and an indicator composition. Such a design bears the risk of false-positive result due to the pH value of the gastric biopsy when it is placed on the sensitive element. Excessive salivation and alkaline bile reflux into the stomach can shift the pH value of the biopsy of the stomach towards alkaline. Drugs that reduce the acidity of the stomach, also contribute to false positive results resulting from the alkalization. In each of these cases, the pH of the biopsy will be shifted to the alkaline side. All of these factors may trigger a non-targeted coloration of the sensitive element in a single-layer rapid urease test. The indicator would change color not in the course of the enzymatic reaction, which then causes alkalization of the medium as a result of ammonia formation, but under the effect of the pH of the gastric biopsy .  Selective urease test  Selective urease tests differ from the single-layer rapid urease tests by their design and higher sensitivity and specificity . In contrast to single- layer rapid urease tests, selective urease tests have several layers, enabling separate enzymatic and indicator reactions. The sample is placed on the first layer impregnated with urea. Ammonia formed during the hydrolysis of urea by urease penetrates through a special selective membrane to the layer impregnated with the indicator composition . Accordingly, the color change occurs directly during the enzymatic reaction. This avoids the influence of the pH value of the sample (gastric biopsy) on the result of a selective urease test, which virtually eliminates the occurrence of false-positive results. If the pH value of the sample is shifted to the acidic side, for example, in the case of increased acidity of gastric juice, this also does not distort the result of the selective urease test . Limitations There is evidence to suggest that H. pylori moves proximal in the stomach in patients on therapy with proton pump inhibitors, and, as such, samples from the fundus and body should be taken in these patients. Active gastrointestinal bleeding reduces accuracy of the test. The specificity and sensitivity of this test is high compared with histopathological examination or urea breath test. The test is often done as part of point-of-care diagnostics, to eliminate the time and expense required to detect H. pylori on pathology testing.

Published by the Texas State Historical Association.James Milton Carroll Papers Accession #90, The Texas Collection  Career  Carroll founded and led the Education Commission of the Baptist General Convention of Texas through its first ten years. He later served as secretary and statistician for the Convention. He was also involved with the regional Southern Baptist Convention (which became a national organization). He pastored churches in Anderson, Corpus Christi, Lampasas, Taylor, Waco, and San Antonio. Active as an educator, Carroll helped found and was the first president of San Marcos Baptist Academy. He later served as the founding president of Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee, paying off the university's debt with his own funds, followed by service as president of Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas. In addition to education, Carroll held various other positions. He was the solicitor for the Texas Baptist and Herald and served as an agent for the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board in Texas. Carroll worked as the financial agent for Baylor College (now the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor) and the endowment secretary for Baylor University. His lasting legacy among Baptists is his booklet entitled The Trail of Blood (1931). This collection of five lectures describes Baptist history as a direct succession from apostolic times of early Christianity. The Trail of Blood promoted the Landmarkist view of Baptist origins, a movement that developed in the mid-nineteenth century among Tennessee and western congregations, and had lasting influences.William Hull, \\"William Heth Whitsitt: Martyrdom of a Moderate,\\" Distinctively Baptist: Essays on Baptist History, ed.

It enables users to play video games, and also connect to the Internet, communicate online and run educational applications. The Zeebo was targeted at developing markets such as Brazil and Mexico. Zeebo Inc. described the Zeebo as bringing \\"the fun and excitement of interactive entertainment and education to those who‚Äîuntil now‚Äîhave had little or no access to such technology.\\" Overview Zeebo was founded by Reinaldo Normand in 2008, based on a working prototype developed by Dave Durnil and business plan by Mike Yuen at Qualcomm. The company's stated intention was to create an affordable console with inexpensive games and educational content delivered via wireless digital distribution to circumvent piracy. There are no DVDs and cartridges; games and other content are downloaded wirelessly over broadband cellular networks. In addition to games, the Zeebo system also provides Internet connectivity, enabling users to access educational and information content, communicate via e-mail and do social networking (this capability was supported in Brazil and Mexico). Zeebo has attracted a growing list of content from companies such as Activision, Capcom, Digital Chocolate, Disney Interactive Studios, Electronic Arts, Fishlabs, Flying Tiger, Gamevil, G-Mode, Glu, id Software, Limbic Software, Namco, Polarbit, Popcap, Twelve Interactive and Vega Mobile. History The Zeebo was first announced in November 2008 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and went on sale there in limited quantities on June 1, 2009 with a suggested retail price of 499,00 Brazilian reais. In September of the same year, the price was cut to R$399,00, and the price was reduced again in November to R$299,00 (‚âà170USD). The console was distributed nationwide in Brazil in December 2009. By August 2010, there were approximately 40 games launched for Zeebo in Brazil. On September 1, 2010, Zeebo announced that it was adding new capabilities and accessories to the Zeebo in Brazil, including Internet connectivity, a keyboard and new more ergonomic gamepad. The new Brazilian system configuration was priced identical to the previous one: R$299 (‚âà170USD). The company announced that Brazilian owners of previous system configurations can upgrade to the new one for free. The Zeebo was launched in Mexico in November 2009. It shipped to national retailers across the country on November 4, 2009, with a suggested price of 2,499 Mexican pesos (approximately $205 US). The Mexican system configuration was similar to that introduced in September 2010 and includes Internet connectivity, a keyboard and ergonomic gamepad. The price was cut to 2249 pesos (approx. $184 US) in April 2010. The Zeebo was available in Brazil and Mexico. Reports indicated that the Zeebo was planned to become available in China by 2011. Zeebo Inc. announced an agreement with AT&T; in March 2010. The company stated that, \\"The agreement gives us access to AT&T;'s international roaming network, allowing us to carry out rapid trials of the Zeebo platform in new geographic areas as we establish longer-term agreements with local carriers for deployment of the system. It will also give us a chance to explore opportunities in the US market in the future.\\" However it appears that Tectoy has decided against the Zeebo and on its homepage now states that they are gearing towards a more educational market. On May 27, 2011, Zeebo announced its end of operations in Brazil and Mexico. According to the company, all games would undergo a price reduction and Zeebonet 3G would remain active until September 30, and all warranty services would be honored. On the same day, on ZeeboNet 3G, a message was added to the details of the game Turma da M√¥nica em Vamos Brincar (\\"Monica's Gang in Let's Play\\"), stating that the game would be unavailable for purchase by the end of the day. Zeebo's home page still stated that the company was \\"currently working on a next generation Android-based platform for launch in 2012\\" but the product had not been released as of May 2019. Wireless capabilities The Zeebo system was developed by Zeebo Inc. with the participation of 12 companies, mainly Qualcomm and Tectoy. It was manufactured and distributed by local partners in target countries (e.g., Tectoy in Brazil). The console uses a Qualcomm BREW mobile gaming chipset similar to that in mobile phones. Players are able to buy and download games and other content wirelessly through 3G or EDGE. The user was always connected to the wireless network without any subscription fee. Purchases are made through an online store using a virtual currency, Z-Credits. Zeebo's gaming delivery system reduces costs (with no discs or cartridges needed) and overcomes piracy barriers ‚Äì two elements that have hindered sales of game consoles in developing markets. Z-Credits are purchased by bank transfer, credit card, bank debit or prepaid cards. Games cost from about 500 to 2500 credits. The console's wireless connectivity also allows users to browse web sites, send and receive e-mail and take part social networking activities via the wireless network. The Zeebo can also perform \\"over-the-air\\" (OTA) updates to the console's firmware‚Äîdelivering new content, features and bug fixes. Accessories =Z-Pad= The standard Zeebo \\"Z-Pad\\" controller includes a total of 7 buttons, a D-Pad and two analog sticks. On the right side, there are four buttons (numbered 1‚Äì4); two shoulder buttons rest on the top, called ZL and ZR; at the center, there is a \\"Home\\" button, which takes the user back the start screen of the Zeebo interface, while functioning as a typical \\"Pause\\" button during games. Directly below this button are the two analog sticks, whereas the D-Pad is located at the leftmost side. =Boomerang= Official Boomerang controller for Zeebo. The Boomerang, sold by Tectoy in Brazil, is a wireless controller with a built-in accelerometer, using motion- sensing technology to play games with actual physical gestures. It has a D-Pad, two buttons (labeled 1‚Äì2) on the top-left side, a \\"Home\\" button, a sliding on-off switch and a wrist strap. It requires two AA batteries as a power supply. =Keyboard= The Zeebo also includes an external keyboard, used with the system's web-browsing, email and social networking functions. Games The Zeebo features remade versions of games from mobile phones and other consoles, such as FIFA 09, Resident Evil 4, Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D, Galaxy on Fire and Rally Master Pro. There are also a number of original game titles developed specifically for the Zeebo, including ‚ÄúZeebo Extreme‚Äù racing games, \\"Boomerang Sports\\" games, Zeebo \\"Football Club\\" games and Un Juego de Huevos (known as Um Jogo de Ovos in Brazil), an action-adventure game based on the hit Mexican animated film Una pel√≠cula de huevos from Huevocartoon. In March 2010, Zeebo began releasing a series of classic arcade games. These games were originally created in the 1980s and 1990s by Data East Corp. in Japan and have been modified to run on the Zeebo system. The titles include Caveman Ninja (originally known as Joe & Mac), Spinmaster, Super Burger Time and Dark Seal (also known as Gate of Doom). In June 2010, in advance of the World Cup, Zeebo released the first of its Football Club (\\"F.C\\") titles, Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp, developed by Zeebo Interactive Studios in Brazil. It includes four mini-games, each emphasizing a particular soccer skill, such as dribbling, juggling and goal-kicking. Along with Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp, the company released Zeeboids, an application that enables users to create personal characters (\\"avatars\\") to be used with the Football Club games. Also in June, Zeebo announced a variety of forthcoming games from independent developers such as Digital Chocolate, Fishlabs, Limbic Software, Twelve Interactive and Vega Mobile. In Brazil, the Zeebo was sold with three free games embedded ‚Äì FIFA 09, Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City and Brain Challenge (known in Portuguese as \\"Treino Cerebral\\"). Three other games, all in Portuguese, are available for free download with new systems: Prey Evil, Zeebo Extreme Rolim√£ and Zeebo Extreme Jetboard. More 30 other titles are available for purchase (via Z-Credits) and download. On September 1, 2010, Zeebo announced a number of new games and educational applications to be launched in 2010 and 2011. They included a new Zeebo Football Club game, called Zeebo F.C. Super League; a series of titles from Disney Interactive Studios, including Disney All Star Cards, Alice in Wonderland and Jelly Car 2; and a series of titles based on the popular Monica's Gang (\\"Turma da Monica\\") comic books in Brazil from cartoonist Mauricio de Sousa. In Mexico, the console includes five free embedded game titles (Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D, Pac Mania, Tekken 2, Zenonia and Zeebo Family Pack). More than a dozen games were available for wireless purchase at the time of the Mexican launch in November 2009. More than a dozen more have since been introduced, all in Spanish.

McPhail first won fame on sketch comedy show A Week of It, partly thanks to his impressions of New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon. He went on to appear in multiple series of sketch show McPhail and Gadsby, and hit comedy Letter to Blanchy. All three shows featured his longtime friend Jon Gadsby. Career Christchurch-based McPhail had appeared on television as a reporter and occasional actor before winning fame in 1977 with A Week of It. One of the earliest New Zealand comedy shows, both to satirise politicians and win a wide audience, the series mixed sketches lampooning politics, sport, and television. A Week of It ran for three seasons. McPhail went on to create and appear in at least seven series of skit show McPhail and Gadsby, co-starring his A Week of It colleague Jon Gadsby, and backwoods comedy Letter to Blanchy, which spawned a 2008 play. McPhail starred in the two seasons of the series Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby. McPhail plays Gormsby, a dominating, old-fashioned school teacher who ruffles feathers when he begins teaching at a school in a low income area. McPhail went on to play eccentric superhero The Green Termite in The Amazing Extraordinary Friends. His autobiography The Years Before My Death: Memories of a Comic Life was published by Longacre in 2010. Honours and awards In the 1992 New Year Honours, McPhail was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for public services. In the 2008 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to television and the theatre.

From dust jacket: \\"The main argument which Lowi develops through both editions is that the liberal state grew to its immense size and presence without self-examination and without recognizing that its pattern of growth had problematic consequences. Its engine of growth was delegation. The government expanded by responding to the demands of all major organized interests, by assuming responsibility for programs sought by those interests, and by assigning that responsibility to administrative agencies. Through the process of accommodation, the agencies became captives of the interest groups, a tendency Lowi describes as clientelism. This in turn led to the formulation of new policies which tightened the grip of interest groups on the machinery of government.\\" *The Politics of Disorder (New York, 1971, 1974) *Poliscide: Scientists, the Giant Accelerator and the Metropolis (et alia) (New York, 1975, 1990) *American Government: Incomplete Conquest (New York, 1976, 1977, 1981) *Nationalizing Government: Public Policies in America (et alia) (Beverly Hills, 1978) *The Personal President: Power Invested, Promise Unfulfilled (Ithaca, 1985) *American Government: Freedom & Power (with Benjamin Ginsburg) (New York, 1990, 1994) *Democrats Return to Power: Politics and Policy in the Clinton Era(with Benjamim Ginsburg)(New York, 1994) *The End of the Republican Era (1995) * \\"American Business, Public Policy, Case-Studies, and Political Theory\\" (1964), World Politics 16(4):677‚Äì715. In this journal article, which reviews a book by Raymond A. Bauer, Ithiel de Sola Pool, and Lewis A. Dexter, Lowi lays out his classic typology of public policy in the U.S.: distribution, regulation, and redistribution. This typology was meant to help political scientists and policy scholars build theories of policy making that could be generalized beyond particular issue areas. Distributive policies, aka \\"pork barrel\\" programs, distribute resources from the government to particular recipients; the winners are concentrated but the losers (those who ultimately pay for the distribution) are diffuse. Regulatory policies are aimed at groups or classes of targets, rather than individuals, and they typically raise costs for the targets (in which case the costs are concentrated). Redistributive policies transfer resources from one class or group to another. A fourth category of policy named by Lowi is the constituent. * \\"Hyperpolitics.

Its campus is now part of the Milton Historic District. History The college was founded as the Milton Academy (high school) by a group of early Milton settlers, including Milton House owner Joseph Goodrich. It eventually grew to encompass 16 buildings spread over . Its music department was renowned, and a high percentage of foreign students for the era kept the student body diverse. Although initially many of the students came from Milton, in later years alumni of the college would stay in Milton or return. =Closing= On May 15, 1982, Milton College abruptly closed its doors. At the time, it was Wisconsin's oldest continually operating college. The college's board of trustees had voted 18-2 to close the campus following a notification from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools that the college's accreditation would be dropped in the fall term; it had previously been on probationary status. The decision from North Central stemmed from the college's continual shaky financial situation, which culminated in a $4 million debt. Milton College had, in fact, been struggling financially since the Great Depression, 50 years earlier. Without accreditation, the college would not have seen any federal loans or grants, adding to an already difficult situation of decreasing student enrollment. Furthermore, it would have no longer been able to compete with schools in the Wisconsin State University System. Some 135 students had been planning to come back to campus when the school closed, many with only a few credits left until completion of their studies. Officials negotiated with other campuses to accept Milton students.\\"Milton has its Black Friday\\". The Milton Courier(Milton, WI) 27 May 1982: 1, 20. Campus life =Athletics= The college was a member of the NAIA and participated in the sports of baseball, basketball and football.

During this time the college produced seven All-Americans and nine conference titles, in 1935, 1956, 1961, 1964, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, and 1981.

He served as Archbishop of Canterbury from 1828 to 1848. Early life, education, and interests Howley was born in 1766 at Ropley, Hampshire, where his father was vicar. He was educated at Winchester College and in 1783 went to New College, Oxford. He became Chaplain to the Marquess of Abercorn in 1792, whose influence was critical in advancing his early career. In 1809 he was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford University (as well as previously becoming a Fellow of Winchester and a Canon of Christ Church, Oxford in 1804). He was an active English Freemason, having joined the 'Royal York Lodge' in Bristol on 21 December 1791, aged 25, and served the lodge regularly until around the turn of the century, including serving as Master of the Lodge. In October 1813, at Lambeth Palace, he was consecrated Bishop of London, a post he was to occupy until 1828, when he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Life as Archbishop of Canterbury Marble bust of Howley by Francis Chantrey, 1821. Yale Center for British Art Howley was Archbishop during the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts (1828), the Emancipation of the Catholics (1829) and the passing of the Great Reform Act (1832). The bench of bishops was generally opposed to all three measures. As archbishop, Howley was their spokesman, and his heart-felt opposition to the Great Reform Act led to his carriage being attacked in the streets of Canterbury. Like very many other bishops at that time, Howley was an \\"old-High Churchman.\\" These inherited a tradition of high views of the sacraments from the Caroline Divines and their successors. They held Catholic beliefs but were consistently anti-Roman. They were often despised by the more extreme Tractarians and their beliefs were often obscured, for example, in Richard William Church's classic account of the Oxford Movement. Archbishop Howley presided over the coronation of William IV and Queen Adelaide in 1831. At 5 a.m. on 20 June 1837, accompanied by the Lord Chamberlain, the Marquis Conyngham, the Archbishop went to Kensington Palace to inform Princess Victoria that she was now Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Architecture was of particular interest to him. During his career, he initiated the renovation and rebuilding of: his official house at Oxford, his town residence while Bishop of London (32 St James's Square), Fulham Palace (also while he was Bishop of London), and finally, extensive renovations to Lambeth Palace. This last project was a virtual reconstruction of the Palace carried out by Edward Blore, the work beginning after 1828 and done mainly in the Gothic Revival style. It took several years and cost upwards of ¬£60,000. Queen Victoria receiving the news of her accession to the throne. The archbishop is on the right. William Howley was married on 29 August 1805 to Mary Frances Belli, a daughter of John Belli, EICS, (1740‚Äì1805) of Southampton who had been Private Secretary to Warren Hastings. The Howleys had two sons and three daughters; neither son reached adulthood. One of his daughters married Sir George Howland Willoughby Beaumont, a nephew of Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet. William Howley died in 1848 and was interred at Addington after an elaborate funeral.

It can also involve parents withholding consenting for particular treatments for their children.Berlinger, Nancy. \\"Conscience Clauses, Health Care Providers, and Parents\\", The Hastings Center In many cases, the clauses also permit health care providers to refuse to refer patients to unopposed providers. Those who choose not to refer or provide services may not be disciplined or discriminated against. The provision is most frequently enacted in connection with issues relating to reproduction, such as abortion (see conscientious objection to abortion), sterilization, contraception, and stem cell based treatments, but may include any phase of patient care. ISSN:1549-3199. LCCN:2004212209. OCLC:.  History  The earliest national conscience clause law in the United States, which was enacted immediately following the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, applied only to abortion and sterilization. It was sponsored by Senator Frank Church of Idaho.Douglas Nejaime & Reva Siegel, Conscience Wars: Complicity- Based Conscience Claims in Religion and Politics, 124 Yale Law Journal 2516 (2015). The Church Amendment of 1973, passed by the Senate on a vote of 92-1, exempted private hospitals receiving federal funds under the Hill-Burton Act, Medicare and Medicaid from any requirement to provide abortions or sterilizations when they objected on ‚Äúthe basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions.‚Äù Nearly every state enacted similar legislation by the end of the decade‚Äîoften with the support of legislators who otherwise supported abortion rights. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, the author of the Roe v. Wade majority opinion, endorsed such clauses ‚Äúappropriate protection‚Äù for individual physicians and denominational hospitals. According to Nancy Berlinger, of the bioethics research institute The Hastings Center, \\"...Conscientious objection in health care always has a social dimension and ...Laws and professional guidelines on conscientious objection in health care must balance the respect for an individual‚Äôs beliefs against the well-being of the general public.\\" Conscience clauses have been adopted by a number of U.S. states. including Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota. There are some recent comprehensive reviews of federal and state conscience clause laws across the United States and in select other countries.Thaddeus Mason Pope, Legal Briefing: Conscience Clauses and Conscientious Refusal, 21(2) Journal of Clinical Ethics 163-180 (2010), http://clinicalethics.com/ Some clauses address local concerns: Oregon, recognizes a physician's right to refuse to participate in physician-assisted suicide, although it is legal in that state. = Informed consent = An informed consent clause, although allowing medical professionals not to perform procedures against their conscience, does not allow professionals to give fraudulent information to deter a patient from obtaining such a procedure (such as lying about the risks involved in an abortion to deter one from obtaining one) in order to impose one's belief using deception. These principles were reaffirmed in the Utah Supreme Court's decision in Wood v. University of Utah Medical Center (2002).Glenn E. Roper, An Open Question in Utah's Open Courts Jurisprudence: The Utah Wrongful Life Act and Wood v. University of Utah Medical Center, 2004 BYU L. Rev. 893 (2004). Commenting on the case, bioethicist Jacob Appel of New York University wrote that \\"if only a small number of physicians intentionally or negligently withhold information from their patients significant damage is done to the medical profession as a whole\\" because \\"pregnant women will no longer know whether to trust their doctors.\\" =Right of Conscience Rule= The Right of Conscience Rule was a set of protections for healthcare workers enacted by President George W. Bush on December 18, 2008, allowing healthcare workers to refuse care based on their personal beliefs. Specifically, the rule denied federal funding to institutions that did not allow workers to refuse care that went against their beliefs. In February 2011, President Barack Obama rescinded the Right of Conscience Rule.Regulation for the Enforcement of Federal Health Care Provider Conscience Protection Laws, 76 Fed. Reg. 9968 (Feb. 23, 2011) (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 88). =Pharmacists= States have historically provided a conscience clause right allowing pharmacists to refrain from participating in abortions.Catherine Grealis, Religion in the Pharmacy: A Balanced Approach to Pharmacists‚Äô Right To Refuse To Provide Plan B , 97 Georgetown Law Journal 1715 (2009). In April 2005, Governor Rod Blagojevich by emergency executive order required all pharmacists to provide Plan B levonorgestrel. In September 2012, the Illinois Appellate Court found the Governor's order violated Illinois law.Morr-Fitz, Inc. v. Quinn, 976 N.E.2d 1160, 364 Ill. Dec. 597 (App. Ct. 2012). In June 2006, the Pharmacy Board of the Washington State Department of Health rejected a draft rule proposed by Governor Christine Gregoire to require all pharmacies to begin carrying Plan B.Jason R. Mau, Stormans and the Pharmacists: Where Have All the Conscientious Rx Gone?, 114 Penn St. L. Rev. 293 (2009). Governor Gregoire responded by releasing a public statement warning the Board members to reconsider or they could be removed. In July 2006, the Washington State Human Rights Commission warned the Board members that they would be personally liable for illegally discriminating against women if they did not pass the Governor's Plan B rule.Recent cases: Ninth Circuit Rejects Strict Srutiny for Pharmacy Dispensing Requirement, 123 Harv. L. Rev. 596 (2009). In April 2007, the Board approved a final rule prohibiting pharmacies from not stocking Plan B for religious reasons but allowing exemptions for ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù business reasons. When Ralph's Thriftway, a grocery store in Olympia, Washington, refused for religious reasons to carry Plan B, it was widely boycotted, leading Gregoire to cancel the grocer's longstanding account with the Washington Governor's Mansion. The only complaints for violating the Plan B rule were filed against the grocer. Half of Washington's hospitals are Catholic. The grocer sued but, instead of alleging violations of the broader Constitution of Washington, its attorneys at the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty only filed under the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution.Noel E. Horton, Article I, Section 11: A Poor \\"Plan B\\" for Washington's Religious Pharmacists\\", 85 Wash. L Rev. 739 (2010). The case is known as Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman. On November 8, 2007, U.S. District Judge Ronald B. Leighton granted the grocer a preliminary injunction blocking the rule.Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 524 F. Supp. 2d 1245 (W.D. Wash. 2007). On May 1, 2008, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judges Thomas G. Nelson and Jay Bybee denied the state a stay of the injunction pending appeal, over a dissent by Judge A. Wallace Tashima.Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 526 F.3d 406 (2008). However, on July 8, 2009, Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw, joined by Richard Clifton and N.

The grocer's petition for certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States was denied on June 28, 2016.http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/stormans-inc-v-wiesman/ Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, writing that ‚Äúthe rules challenged here reflect antipathy towards religious beliefs that do not accord with the views of those holding the levers of government power.‚ÄùStormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, No. 15-862 (U.S. June 28, 2016). In 2014 and 2016, Senator Cory Booker introduced the ‚ÄúAccess to Birth Control Act‚Äù bill, which would require all pharmacists in the United States to provide emergency contraception. Responses Health care providers opposed to abortion or contraception support the clauses because they believe that disciplinary or legal action for refusing to perform services obliges providers to supply services which their moral or religious principles forbid. Reproductive rights organizations, such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, oppose the provision because they maintain that pharmacists, doctors, and hospitals have a professional duty to fulfill patients' legal medical needs, regardless of their own ethical stances. Opponents see conscience clauses as an attempt to limit reproductive rights in lieu of bans struck down by Supreme Court rulings such as Roe v. Wade.Refusal Clauses: A Threat to Reproductive Rights As a result, the term \\"conscience clause\\" is controversial and primarily used by those who support these provisions. Those who oppose them often prefer to use the term \\"refusal clause,\\" implying that those who exercise the clauses are refusing to treat a patient.

It is inherent in the field of random lasers. Origins ASE is produced when a laser gain medium is pumped to produce a population inversion. Feedback of the ASE by the laser's optical cavity may produce laser operation if the lasing threshold is reached. Excess ASE is an unwanted effect in lasers, since it is not coherent, and limits the maximum gain that can be achieved in the gain medium. ASE creates serious problems in any laser with high gain and/or large size. In this case, a mechanism to absorb or extract the incoherent ASE must be provided, otherwise the excitation of the gain medium will be depleted by the incoherent ASE rather than by the desired coherent laser radiation. ASE is especially problematic in lasers with short and wide optical cavities, such as disk lasers (active mirrors). ASE can also be a desirable effect, finding use in broadband light sources. If the cavity has no optical feedback, lasing will be inhibited, resulting in a broad emission bandwidth due to the bandwidth of the gain medium. This results in low temporal coherence, offering reduced speckle noise when compared with a laser. Spatial coherence can be high, however, allowing for tight focusing of the radiation. These characteristics make such sources useful for fiber optic systems and optical coherence tomography. Examples of such sources include superluminescent diodes and doped fiber amplifiers. =ASE in organic dye lasers= ASE in pulsed organic dye lasers can have very broad spectral characteristics (as much as 40-50 nm wide) and presents, as such, a serious challenge in the design and operation of tunable narrow-linewidth dye lasers. In order to suppress ASE, in favor of pure laser emission, researchers use various approaches including optimized laser cavity designs. =ASE in disk lasers: Controversy= According to some publications, at the power scaling of disk lasers, the round-trip gain should be reduced,; which means hardening of requirement on the background loss. Other researchers believe the existing disk lasers work far from such a limit, and the power scaling can be achieved without modification of existing laser materials . =ASE in self healing dye doped polymers= In 2008, a group at Washington state university observed reversible photodegradation or simply, self healing in organic dyes like Disperse orange 11http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/ProductDetail.do?D7=0&N5;=SEARCH_CONCAT_PNOBRAND_KEY&N4;=217093SIAL&N25;=0&QS;=ON&F;=SPEC when doped in polymers.

After the compression of the laser pulse, which is temporally stretched during the amplification, the ASE causes a quasi-continuous pedestal which is partly located at times before the compressed laser pulse. Due to the high intensities within the focal spot of up to 10^22 W/cm2 the ASE is often sufficient to significantly disturb the experiment or even make the desired laser-target interaction impossible.

It is named after the House of Bruce who formerly owned the land on which it is built. Believed to stand on the site of an earlier building, about which little is known, the current house is one of the oldest surviving English brick houses. It was remodelled in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The house has been home to Sir William Compton, the Barons Coleraine and Sir Rowland Hill, among others. After serving as a school during the 19th century, when a large extension was built to the west, it was converted into a museum exploring the history of the areas now constituting London Borough of Haringey and, on the strength of its connection with Sir Rowland Hill, the history of the Royal Mail. The building also houses the archives of the London Borough of Haringey. Since 1892 the grounds have been a public park, Tottenham's oldest. Origins of the name Earl of Dorset's Survey of Tottenham. The Norman All Hallows' Church and priory, then as now the oldest surviving buildings in the area, are also shown.As with most other English maps of the period, the map is aligned with south at the top (i.e. \\"upside down\\" when compared to modern maps). The alignment of streets in the area is preserved today; the road running east- west is the present-day Lordship Lane, and the road running north-south past the church is the present-day Church Lane; Bruce Grove does not yet exist, but its eventual route can be seen in the field boundaries running diagonally immediately south of the castle. The large field opposite the house (marked \\"Lease\\") is the northeast corner of the water-meadow, which became Broadwater Farm. The fields to the east of Church Lane are the present Bruce Castle Park, while those to the west surrounding the church now form part of Tottenham Cemetery. The name Bruce Castle is derived from the House of Bruce, who had historically owned a third of the manor of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and it is unlikely that the family lived nearby.Pegram 1987, p. 2 Upon his accession to the Scottish throne in 1306, Robert I of Scotland forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham, ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to Richard Spigurnell and Thomas Hethe. The three parts of the manor of Tottenham were united in the early 15th century under the Gedeney family and have remained united since. In all early records, the building is referred to as the Lordship House. The name Bruce Castle first appears to have been adopted by Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635‚Äì1708), although Daniel Lysons speculates in The Environs of London (1795) the name's use dates to the late 13th century. Architecture The round tower A detached, cylindrical Tudor tower stands immediately to the south-west of the house, and is generally considered to be the earliest part of the building;Pegram 1987, p. 3 however, Lysons believes it to have been a later addition. The tower is built of local red brick, and is tall, with walls thick. In 2006, excavations revealed that it continues for some distance below the current ground level. It was described in 1829 as being over a deep well, and being used as a dairy.Bruce Castle , The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Vol. 13, No. 350., (3 January 1829). Retrieved 27 January 2010 Sources disagree on the house's initial construction date, and no records survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating parts of the building to the 15th century; William Robinson's History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham (1840) suggests a date of about 1514,Robinson 1840, p. 216 although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century. Nikolaus Pevsner speculates the front may have formed part of a courtyard house of which the remainder has disappeared.Cherry and Pevsner 1998, p. 584 The Grade I mansion's principal facade has been substantially remodelled. The house is made of red brick with ashlar quoining and the principal facade, terminated by symmetrical matching bays, has tall paned windows. The house and detached tower are among the earliest uses of brick as the principal building material for an English house.Cherry and Pevsner 1998, p. 11 Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635‚Äì1708) oversaw a substantial remodelling of the house in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house's centre, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch. In the early 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694‚Äì1749) oversaw a remodelling of the north of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the pediment of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor. In the early 19th century, the house's west wing was demolished, leaving it with the asymmetrical appearance it retains today.Pegram 1987, p. 9 The house was converted into a school, and in 1870 a three-story extension was built in the Gothic Revival style to the northwest of the house. The 2006 excavations by the Museum of London uncovered the chalk foundations of an earlier building on the site, of which nothing is known. Court rolls of 1742 refer to the repair of a drawbridge, implying that the building then had a moat. A 1911 archaeological journal made passing reference to \\"the recent levelling of the moat\\". Early residents William Larkin; in the collection of the Iveagh Bequest at Kenwood House.An added inscription on this painting misidentifies the sitter as Edward Sackville, Richard's younger brother, later 4th Earl of Dorset. See Karen Hearn, ed. Dynasties: Painting in Tudor and Jacobean England 1530‚Äì1630. New York: Rizzoli, 1995. , pp. 198‚Äì199 Sackville's large debts led to the sale of the house to Hugh Hare. It is generally believed the house's first owner was Sir William Compton, Groom of the Stool to Henry VIII and one of the period's prominent courtiers, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514. However, there is no evidence of Compton's living in the house, and there is some evidence the building dates to a later period. The earliest known reference to the building dates from 1516, when Henry VIII met his sister Margaret, Queen of Scots, at \\"Maister Compton's House beside Tottenham\\". The Comptons owned the building throughout the 16th century, but few records of the family or the building survive.Pegram 1987, p. 4 In the early 17th century, Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset and Lady Anne Clifford owned the house. Sackville ran up high debts through gambling and extravagant spending; the house (then still called \\"The Lordship House\\") was leased to Thomas Peniston. Peniston's wife, Martha, daughter of Sir Thomas Temple was said to be the Earl of Dorset's mistress.Clifford 1990, p. 83 The house was later sold to wealthy Norfolk landowner Hugh Hare.Pegram 1987, p. 5 17th century: the Hare family =Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine= Hugh Hare (1606‚Äì1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter. As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine. =Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine= Henry Hare (1635‚Äì1708) settled at the Lordship House, renaming it Bruce Castle in honour of the area's historic connection with the House of Bruce. Hare was a noted historian and author of the first history of Tottenham. He grew up at the Hare family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the family were still living in Totteridge, while by the time of the death of his first wife Constantia, in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle. According to Hare, Constantia was buried in All Hallows Church in Tottenham. However, the parish register for the period is complete and makes no mention of her death or burial.Pegram 1987, p. 6 Northumberland Row, near where White Hart Lane joins Ermine Street (A10). Following the death of Constantia, Hare married Sarah Alston. They had been engaged in 1661, but she had instead married John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset. There is evidence that during Sarah's marriage to Seymour and Hare's marriage to Constantia, a close relationship was sustained between them.Pegram 1987, p. 7 The house was substantially remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's marriage to the dowager Duchess of Somerset, and much of the existing south facade dates from this time. The facade's central tower with a belvedere is a motif of the English Renaissance of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. Hatfield House, also close to London, had a similar central tower constructed in 1611, as does Blickling Hall in Norfolk, built circa 1616. The Ghostly Lady of Bruce Castle Although sources such as Pegram speculate that Constantia committed suicide in the face of a continued relationship between Hare and the Duchess of Somerset, little is known about her life and the circumstances of her early death, and her ghost reputedly haunts the castle.Underwood 1992, pp. 46‚Äì147 The grounds of Bruce Castle, now a public park The earliest recorded reference to the ghost appeared in 1858‚Äîalmost two hundred years after her death‚Äîin the Tottenham & Edmonton Advertiser. The legend has now been largely forgotten, and there have been no reported sightings of the ghost in recent times. Residents in the 18th century North elevation, showing the Coleraine crest on the north pediment Sarah Hare died in 1692 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, and Hare in 1708, to be succeeded by his grandson Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine. Henry Hare was a leading antiquary, residing only briefly at Bruce Castle between lengthy tours of Europe. The house was remodelled again under the 3rd Baron Coleraine's ownership. An extra range of rooms was added to the north, and the pediment of the north front ornamented with a large coat of the Coleraine arms. Hare's marriage was not consummated, and following an affair with a French woman, Rosa du Plessis, du Plessis bore him his only child, a daughter named Henrietta Rosa Peregrina, born in France in 1745.Pegram 1987, p. 8 Hare died in 1749 leaving his estates to the four-year-old Henrietta, but her claim was rejected owing to her French nationality. After many years of legal challenges, the estates, including Bruce Castle, were granted to her husband James Townsend, whom she had married at age 18. James Townsend remodelled the east facade to have the appearance of a typical Georgian house. James Townsend was a leading citizen of the day. He served as a magistrate, was Member of Parliament for West Looe, and in 1772 became Lord Mayor of London, while Henrietta was a prominent artist, many of whose engravings of 18th-century Tottenham survive in the Bruce Castle Museum. After 1764, under the ownership of James Townsend, the house was remodelled again. The narrow east front was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house, while the gabled attics on the south front were removed, giving the south facade the appearance it has today. James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, showed little interest in the area or in the traditional role of the Lord of the Manor. After leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold in 1792 to Thomas Smith of Gray's Inn as a country residence. John Eardley Wilmot John Eardley Wilmot (c. 1749 ‚Äì 23 June 1815) was Member of Parliament for Tiverton (1776‚Äì1784) and Coventry (1784‚Äì1796), and in 1783 led the Parliamentary Commission investigating the events that led to the American Revolution. He also led the processing of compensation claims, and the supply of basic housing and provisions, for the 60,000 Loyalist refugees who arrived in England after the independence of the United States. Following the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, a second wave of refugees arrived in England. Although the British government did not offer them organised relief, Wilmot, in association with William Wilberforce, Edmund Burke and George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham, founded \\"Wilmot's Committee\\", which raised funds to provide accommodation and food, and found employment for refugees from France, large numbers of whom settled in the Tottenham area. In 1804, Wilmot retired from public life and moved to Bruce Castle to write his memoirs of the American Revolution and his role in the investigations of its causes and consequences. They were published shortly before his death in 1815. After Wilmot's death, London merchant John Ede purchased the house and its grounds, and demolished the building's west wing. The Hill School Sir Rowland Hill Hill and his brothers had taken over the management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering.Pegram 1987, p. 10A printing press designed by Rowland Hill and built by the school's pupils is on display at London's Science Museum. At this time, school curricula were almost always restricted to the classics; for a school to include engineering was almost unique. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London- based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage. In 1839 Rowland Hill, who had written an influential proposal on postal reform, was appointed as head of the General Post Office (where he introduced the world's first postage stamps), leaving the school in the hands of his younger brother Arthur Hill. 19th-century extension to house the school During the period of the School's operation, the character of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on Ermine Street (later the A10 road), surrounded by marshland and farmland. The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840, with stations at Tottenham Hale and Marsh Lane (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via Stratford, more than double the distance of the direct road route), as well as providing direct connections to the Port of London.Lake 1945, pp. 12‚Äì13 In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a direct line from Enfield to Liverpool Street station,Lake 1945, p. 22 including a station at Bruce Grove, close to Bruce Castle;Connor 2004, ¬ß 54 the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London.Olsen 1976, p. 290 As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; by the end of the 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself, and the waterlogged floodplains of the River Lea at Tottenham Marshes and of the River Moselle at Broadwater Farm. \\"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\\". In 1877 Birkbeck Hill retired from the post of headmaster, ending his family's association with the school. The school closed in 1891, and Tottenham Council purchased the house and grounds. The grounds of the house were opened to the public as Bruce Castle Park in June 1892,Cherry and Pevsner 1998, p. 57 the first public park in Tottenham. The house opened to the public as Bruce Castle Museum in 1906.Pegram 1987, p. 11 =Heraud's Tottenham= Bruce Castle was among the buildings mentioned in John Abraham Heraud's 1820 Spenserian epic, Tottenham, a romantic depiction of the life of Robert the Bruce: Present day Historic postboxes on display Bruce Castle is now a museum, holding the archives of the London Borough of Haringey, and housing a permanent exhibition on the past, present and future of Haringey and its predecessor boroughs, and temporary displays on the history of the area. Other exhibits include an exhibition on Rowland Hill and postal history, a significant collection of early photography, a collection of historic manorial documents and court rolls related to the area, and one of the few copies available for public reading of the Spurs Opus, the complete history of Tottenham Hotspur. In 1949, the building was Grade I listed; the round tower was separately Grade I listed at the same time, and the 17th-century southern and western boundary walls of the park were Grade II listed in 1974. In 1969 the castle became home to the regimental museum of the Middlesex Regiment whose collection was subsequently transferred to the National Army Museum. In July 2006 a major community archaeological dig was organised in the grounds by the Museum of London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre, as part of the centenary celebrations of the opening of Bruce Castle Museum, in which large numbers of local youths took part. As well as large quantities of discarded everyday objects, the chalk foundations of what appears to be an earlier house on the site were discovered. In 2012 the public grounds at Bruce Castle were used for PARK ART in Haringey, part of the borough's cultural Olympiad offer for 2012. Up Projects, in partnership with Haringey Council and funded by Arts Council England, commissioned Ben Long to create \\"Lion Scaffolding Sculpture\\", a nine-metre tall classical lion on a plinth that was constructed from builder's scaffolding. The monumental sculpture, created for the front lawn of Bruce Castle Museum, referenced the traditional archetype of the regal lion commonly found in the grounds of stately homes, but also the heraldic emblem of Robert the Bruce, therefore reflecting on the heritage of the building. Build in situ over four weeks, the fabrication became a durational performance, highlighting the role that work and labour play in the development of any artistic or creative pursuit..

The state designates the start and finish of the road at its interchange with Nicholasville Road on the city's south side. Exit numbering increases as one travels clockwise. Roughly three-fourths of the highway is limited-access, with all movements controlled at 10 interchanges. The remainder is classified as an urban principal arterial highway with a heavy mix of driveway entrances and intersections with one single-point urban interchange at US 60 (Winchester Road) and a diverging diamond interchange at US 68 (Harrodsburg Road). The dividing line between the limited-access segment and the urban arterial highway is US 25 (Richmond and Georgetown Roads) north and east of the city. The speed limit is on the freeway section and on the urban arterial highway. New Circle Road suffers serious traffic congestion during rush hour due to the lack of other freeways running through the city. Harrodsburg Road, Nicholasville Road, Tates Creek Road, and Newtown Pike also suffer serious congestion because of people trying to get on New Circle and head out of downtown Lexington. History New Circle Road was constructed in several segments from 1950 to 1967 as a circumferential bypass. The first segment to be built, from KY 922 (Newtown Pike) to US 25 (Richmond Road)/US 421, was constructed by the city of Lexington in 1952 as two-lane connector road. The original section included at-grade intersections at Palumbo Drive, KY 1927 (Liberty Road), KY 57 (Bryan Station Road), Old Paris Pike, US 27/US 68, and at KY 353 (Russell Cave Road), with one interchange at US 60 (Winchester Road). This segment of the road is also known as the Northern Belt Line or the US 25 Bypass. To help finance the construction of the original 1952 portion, driveway access was sold to property owners along the route.http://www.newcircleroad.com/ At the time of construction, this area was mostly rural and surrounded by horse farms, as Lexington had not yet begun to sprawl out that far. After the opening, this section experienced rapid growth and the need to widen it to four lanes from two became evident. In 1958, maintenance was taken over by the state and construction began on the widening to four lanes as it became US 25 Bypass. In 1966, a study began on more improvements to the original stretch of New Circle Road due to \\"extremely congested conditions.\\" One of the improvements suggested as another bypass east of New Circle but was ruled out as being \\"too expensive and disruptive.\\" As an interim solution, frontage roads were constructed along a few portions of New Circle, and longer turning lanes were constructed. The remainder of the highway around Lexington was constructed to near-urban freeway standards with controlled access. Construction of interchanges at US 25 (Richmond Road)/US 421, KY 1974 (Tates Creek Road), US 27 (Nicholasville Road), US 68 (Harrodsburg Road), US 60 (Versailles Road), KY 1681 (Old Frankfort Pike), US 421 (Leestown Road), US 25 (Georgetown Road) and at KY 922 (Newtown Pike). The interchange with Alumni Drive was constructed in late 1984 at a cost of $2 million with the extension of what was then Mount Tabor Road southeastward towards Man o' War Boulevard. =Winchester Road/US 60 interchange reconstruction= The interchange with US 60 (Winchester Road), built in 1961, was sorely out-of-date by the 1980s. Tight ramps and a narrow underpass with no acceleration or deceleration lanes made this a dangerous pseudo-cloverleaf interchange. Trucks, too tall for the substandard overpass height clearance, would frequently damage the bridge girders. Work started in the late 1990s to convert this outdated exit into a single-point urban interchange (SPUI). There are two left turn lanes on each ramp, and those are controlled by a single traffic light instead of two. Longer ramps for merging onto New Circle Road were added. In the fall of 2000, the new Winchester Road interchange opened to traffic at a cost of $8.1 million. =Reconstructing New Circle Road= An early study, part of the \\"Urban County Government's Year 2000 Transportation Plan\\", stated that New Circle should be widened to six-lanes by the year 2000. There was no available funding for the project that would cost $31 million. In 1987, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government recommended a solution to the section of New Circle Road from Georgetown Road/US 25 to Richmond Road/US 25/US 421. New Circle Road in the northeastern quadrant of Lexington has high traffic volumes, numerous accidents and traffic delays as motorists face numerous commercial access points, congested intersections, poor traffic signal progressions, and a very low level of service made worse during peak hours. None of these recommendations by the urban government were implemented however. By 1997, a section of New Circle from Tates Creek Road to Nicholasville Road was averaging more than 60,000 vehicles per day, up from 17,000 30 years ago and an increase of 256%. The section from Alumni Drive to Tates Creek Road saw a 155% increase, and the stretch from Harrodsburg Road to Versailles Road saw a 512% increase. A study was initiated at a cost of $2.6 million on widening a stretch from Georgetown Road to Richmond Road around the western and southern reaches of the city. The traffic volume is so large that \\"officials could justify widening the road to as many as five lanes in each direction.\\" In 1999, a study of the fully controlled access portion of New Circle Road was completed for the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. The study focused on an eight and ten-lane alternative. The eight-lane alternative was recommended at a cost of $218 million but no funds have been allocated for that portion of New Circle Road as of this date. That study did not include recommendations for New Circle Road between Georgetown Road/US 25 to Richmond Road/US 25/US 421 other than proposed improvements for the interchanges at Georgetown Road/US 25 and Richmond Road/US 25/US 421. In August 1999, the Kentucky Transportation Center at the University of Kentucky College of Engineering completed Research Report KTC-99-55, \\"Conversion of New Circle Road to a limited Access Facility\\". The study compared the addition of one lane in each direction with the use of median U-turns and restricted left-turn strategies at selected intersections from Newtown Pike/KY 922 to Richmond Road/US 25/US 421. This was presented to the Lexington Area Metropolitan Planning Organization and is considered to have been the stimulus for the development of the New Circle Road Northeast improvement study that began on December 1 of 1999. Four alternatives for the segment from Newtown Pike/KY 922 to Richmond Road/US 25/US 421 were presented and a fifth was introduced later after combining several key ideas that the residents voiced their approval of at several public meetings: =Recent construction projects= A cable barrier system was installed along the median of the unsignalized portion of New Circle Road between the Richmond Road and Old Frankfort Pike Interchanges, which is a distance of just over eight miles (13 km). The $2.4 million project was started in the spring of 2007 and completed in the summer of 2007. The first of many projects to improve the commercialized section of New Circle Road began in the summer of 2007. It included access management improvements, median construction, shoulder repair, turn lane extensions, and resurfacing from the intersection with Newtown Pike to the intersection with Industry Road. The $3.8 million project was completed in the fall of 2007. In the fall of 2011, a diverging diamond interchange was added to the Harrodsburg Road exit to help alleviate traffic jams. In November 2012, the Kentucky Department of Transportation announced the widening of New Circle Road from four to six lanes from just west of Georgetown Road to Versailles Road. Construction began in the fall of 2013 and was completed in 2016 at a cost of $80 million.

He held many important civic positions and founded the Knights of Saint Mary (also known as the Order of the glorious Saint Mary or Jovial Friars (Frati Gaudenti, in Latin)) in 1261. Loderingo was the brother of Diana, who founded the Dominican Monastery of Saint Agnes. He was governor of Modena in 1251, and, with Catalano dei Malavolti, shared the position of governor of Bologna in 1265, of Florence in 1266, and of Bologna again in 1267. The Order and the monastery were founded in 1233. The Order, which was approved by Pope Alexander IV in 1261, was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of 'militissa' to women who were the daughter, spouse or widow of a Knight. Its mission was to promote peace between warring municipal factions, but its members soon succumbed to self-interest and it was suppressed by Sixtus V in 1558. In 1267 he joined the Jovial Friars' monastery that he had founded at Ronzano where he stayed until his death. In Dante Alighieri's Inferno (of the Divine Comedy), he is found among the hypocrites in the Eighth Circle of Hell. Loderingo is extolled for his fortitude in dying by his friend the poet Guittone d'Arezzo. He is also known as Loderingo degli Andal√≤, Loderingo d'Andal√≤, and Loderigo d'Andalo.

The word Sheriff evolved from 'shire-reeve'. Sheriff is the oldest secular office under the Crown. Formerly the sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer in the county but over the centuries most of the responsibilities associated with the post have been transferred elsewhere or are now defunct, so that its functions are now largely ceremonial. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the office previously known as Sheriff was retitled High Sheriff. The title of sheriff is therefore much older than the other Crown appointment, the Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, which came about in 1535. Unlike the Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, which is generally held from appointment until the holder's death or incapacity, the title of High Sheriff is appointed / reappointed annually.

Dumpville was an early refuse site on Southern Pacific Railroad land, a loosely structured community of mostly men, not unlike dump sites across the planet. It was on the shore of Mission Creek, the waters called \\"poverty lake.\\" Dumpville was a location where poor people lived in makeshift housing and sifted through the trash for items that had some value, cans, cloth, metal, bottles and utensils. When the city needed land for a rail yard and wished to push crime and poverty further away from town, a murder was the pretext for a police crackdown. On November 9, 1895, a troop of twenty police from the southern district under the command of Captain John Spillane marched down sixth street late at night, burned the shanties and evicted the scavengers from the site which was quickly filled to be used as part of the huge southern Pacific railroad yards along Channel Street. After the 1906 earthquake, San Francisco needed dumping ground for the massive debris from the burned district. Contractors were engaged to remove the rubble. The California Board of State Harbor Commissioners offered space behind the seawall planned for the north side of Mission Creek but they asked land owners to keep the rubble on their lots until the Seawall construction began later that summer. The site is currently (2006) being developed as a biotech campus for the University of California, San Francisco.

It is a concept album that tells the story of a war between Heaven and Hell which the latter side wins. It was touted as Venom's crossover into mainstream music, but failed to do so.https://www.allmusic.com/album/at- war-with-satan-mw0000196214 Shortly after it went on sale, the HMV record chain withdrew the album from its shelves because of its anti-Christian content. Background The inspiration for writing a track filling out an entire side of the record, according to Venom's bass guitarist and vocalist Cronos, came from Rush's 2112 album.Kupfer, Thomas: Venom. Jesus musste gehen. In: Rock Hard, no. 304, September 2012, p. 40. \\"At War with Satan\\" is centred on a character named Abaddon (which is also the alias of Tony Bray, Venom's drummer), who is the guardian to the gates of Hell. Cronos started writing, in his school days, a story about \\"how Hell revolts and takes over the heavens and throws God into Hell\\", a story later fleshed out as \\"At War with Satan\\". The title track's imagery and storyline largely evokes the Book of Revelation and John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost (1667‚Äì1674), filtered through a postmodern horror movie and pulp aesthetic. With side A taken by the epic title track, side B offers the \\"three-minute scorchers\\" for which the band is best known. The metal journalist Malcolm Dome said that songs such as \\"Cry Wolf\\" showed how much Venom had matured in their songwriting without losing their edge.Dome 2002, p. 7. According to the AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, the album's last track, \\"Aaaaaarrghh\\", is \\"possibly the funniest song ever recorded\\". Artwork At War with Satans packaging resembled the leatherbound sleeve of a bookcover. A hundred-page The Book of Armageddon with the entire story of At War with Satan was supposed to be published alongside the album, but it never happened. The Swiss independent distributor Disctrade tried to interest Venom in H. R. Giger's painting Satan I (1977) to no avail.Fischer & Ain 2009, pp. 148‚Äì149. It later became the cover art of Celtic Frost's second album, To Mega Therion (1985).Fischer & Ain 2009, p. 227. Reception By the time At War with Satan went on sale, Venom had reached a crossroads in their career.Dome 2002, p. 8. Critics felt that their third album should have propelled them into the heavy metal mainstream, something which failed to materialize.Dome 2002, p. 9. Venom were also being threatened by thrash metal upstarts such as Metallica, who two months before At War with Satan's release were the opening act for Venom's Seven Dates of Hell tourMcIver 2009, p. 125. (Roughly a year later Venom also took Slayer and Exodus on their North American Combat Tour).McIver 2008, pp. 64‚Äì65. This was Metallica's first European tour, which included concerts in Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium and the Aardschok Festival in the Netherlands. The record was well received by major music magazines. \\"Proof positive that Venom are the best heavy metal band in the world\\", said Melody Makers Neil Jeffries of the album. \\"It will definitely go down in Heavy Metal history as the ultimate headbang,\\" claimed a Sounds reviewer of the title track. At War with Satan's entry on the \\"Where to Start with\\" section of the Kerrang! site says that this was the \\"last truly great record the Geordie three would make\\". Some criticism, though, was directed toward the album's production values, viewed as subpar.Dome 2002, p. 6. The title track's merits divided critics. In the opinion of About.com's Chad Bowar, \\"At War with Satan\\" is at the same time \\"highly ambitious\\" and \\"bloated\\", but the song was \\"so over-the-top and so dramatic that it somehow worked\\" and made the album \\"an overlooked metal gem\\". The Allmusic review's tone was harsher: this concept piece was an \\"ill-advised anomaly\\", much of it \\"decidedly crap\\". The rise of metal's popularity in the 1980s was paralleled by the political power gained by conservative organisations such as the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). The Christian campaign against the \\"offensive\\" content of rock music carried out by certain political groups in America eventually crossed over to the United Kingdom. Venom became one of its early victims: HMV stopped selling At War with Satan in fear of being threatened by legal action because of Britain's obscenity laws. The PMRC later included the title track of Venom's following album Possessed in their \\"Filthy Fifteen\\" list.Jonathon Green, Nicholas J. Karolides: Encyclopedia of Censorship. New Edition.

History On the morning of 19 June 1875, John Walsh opened a small baby linen and ladies' outfitting shop, at number 39 High Street, Sheffield. By 1888 the business had grown and had purchased shop units on both on the north and south sides of the High Street. In 1902 John Walsh retired from the business and the store was incorporated as John Walsh Ltd. with five directors coming from the Walsh family. The business had grown into a department store offering the sale of silks, dresses, millinery, ribbons, laces, flowers, feathers, toys, stationery, patent medicine and other goods as well as maintaining restaurant and writing rooms, and by 1906 had opened its own cabinet making factory in Pinfold Street. During the Second World War the store was destroyed by the Sheffield Blitz in 1940 and the business re-opened in former staff accommodation at The Mount and Fargate. To secure the companies furniture business, the factory in Pinfold Street was made into a separate business, John Walsh Manufacturing Co Ltd in 1944, which continued to trade until its closure in 1957. The business was acquired by Harrods in 1946, who had the funds to rebuild the destroyed store. The new store opened to great acclaim in 1953. The Harrods group was taken over by House of Fraser in 1959 and the store later renamed, firstly as Rackhams Sheffield from 1972 and then House of Fraser Sheffield from 1987. The store was closed in 1998. The former Walsh's building was then occupied by T J Hughes. TJ Hughes then went into administration in August 2011, and although this store survived, the landlord of the building expired TJ Hughes lease on this 6 floor former department store.

It has a faith-based educational program for students in grades 6 through 12. Description Founded by parents in 1980, the school is governed by an elected board of trustees. It is accredited by the state of Washington, the Northwest Association of Independent Schools. It is a member of the National Catholic Education Association and the Washington Federation of Independent Schools (WFIS). Eastside Catholic consists of a middle school, grades 6‚Äì8, with approximately 215 students, and a high school, grades 9‚Äì12, with approximately 645 students. The athletics mascot is the Crusader and the school colors are orange and navy blue. Eastside Catholic also offers an integrated special education program for high school students, the Options Program. History Eastside Catholic campus in springThe idea for Eastside Catholic originated in 1974 and the new school opened its doors in 1980 in downtown Bellevue. For the first nine years, the campus was south of the Bellevue Square mall, at the former Bellevue Junior High School (old Bellevue High), which is now the Downtown Park.Eastside Heritage Center - Bellevue Schools Timeline ‚Äì accessed September 19, 2013 The next campus was also rented from the Bellevue School District at the former Ringdall Junior High (1970‚Äì87) at 11650 SE 60th Street in Newport Hills. Eastside Catholic was located at that campus for nineteen years, from 1989 to June 2008. In August 2008, Eastside Catholic opened a new $42 million campus in the city of Sammamish. The school also included an expansion to include grades 6‚Äì8. The school made headlines when the resignation of vice-principal Mark Zmuda was announced in December 2013. Zmuda said he had been fired. Media reports said he was asked to resign because of his same-sex marriage in July 2013. Over 400 students conducted a sit-in protest in his support, with many teachers supporting the protest as well. The school stated in a letter to parents that \\"Mark's same- sex marriage over the summer violated his employment contract with the school\\" and that the school had been \\"directed to comply with the teachings of the church\\". In response to the student protest, the school administration stated that students would be sent home for any additional campus protests. This failed to quell the controversy, and on January 22, 2014, the president of the school resigned. The school board of trustees accepted her resignation, saying, \\"For Sister Mary it was a difficult but necessary decision so that a new leader can be brought in to ensure the entire Eastside Catholic community is on a positive path forward.\\" In August 2017, the school underwent another major disruption of its leadership. The overall principal of the school and the principal of the middle school were both dismissed, and 13 other faculty members resigned in response. Amid the dispute, an online petition was established that collected more than 400 signatures, calling for the dismissals to be reversed. The school's president (Father William Heric) and the two co-chairs of the board of trustees were reported to have fired the principals without the permission of the rest of the board of trustees. The two trustees who were blamed for the action then resigned and the board of trustees removed Heric from the position of interim president. The dismissed principals and other faculty members were invited to return. The turmoil resulted in the school being unable to open on time for its fall session, so the start of classes was delayed by a week. =Sporting Championships= Eastside Catholic has won ten state titles from 1984 to 2018: * 1984: Girls Cross Country * 2010: Division II Girls Lacrosse * 2014: 3A Football * 2015: 3A Football *2016: Cheerleading Non-Tumbling *2016: Girls' Lacrosse *2017: Cheerleading Non-Tumbling *2017: Girls' Lacrosse *2017: Boys' Lacrosse ‚Äì Private School *2018: 3A Football Fight song (To the Theme of the Oregon Ducks Fight Song) Catch the Spirit Eastside Catholic, The Crusaders won't be beat, Our opponents learn the lesson As we push them to defeat.

Born in Yankton, South Dakota, Meredith's roots are in rhythm and blues, later branching out into progressive rock in his late teens. Meredith lived in Manhattan, Kansas and formed Saratoga with Kerry Livgren, Don Montre and Dan Wright after high school in Topeka, Kansas. Saratoga merged with another Topeka group, White Clover, that became the first version of Kansas in 1970. As Kansas began to play original music from member Kerry Livgren, Meredith began using his voice as another instrument, and searched for ways to add to the music using falsetto and various vocalizations. Kansas I broke up later that year and Kansas II began with some additional new members, but the core of Meredith, Livgren, Montre and Wright remained. Kansas II stayed together until early 1974 when Livgren left the band to join White Clover. That version became the well known version of Kansas. After Kansas, Meredith did not sing professionally for many years, but recorded with a band called Plastique in the early 1980s. He has since reunited with his other Kansas II cohorts in Proto-Kaw. Currently, Meredith records with Proto Kaw, the reformed version of Kansas. Proto Kaw re-grouped after the original Kansas II demo recordings were discovered and released on Cuneiform Records in 2002. This release caused the original members of Kansas to communicate for the first time in 28 years. A reunion party was planned in Kansas City in 2002 and the band enjoyed playing together again. This led to Kerry Livgren writing music for some experimental recordings with the members and an album, Before Became After was released under the Proto Kaw name in April 2004 on the Inside Out Music Label. Since that time, Proto Kaw has begun performing live again and released their third CD The Wait of Glory in January 2006. They toured Europe in 2006 and released their fourth CD in 2011 entitled \\"Forth\\". Recently Lynn Meredith took part in \\"Ancient Rites of the Moon\\" , the first √°lbum of the international super group Stardust Reverie Project released in 2014 and performed the vocals for \\"Song for Catina\\". He was also asked to perform two additional songs on the new Stardust Reverie album \\"Proclamation of Shadows\\" entitled \\"Silver Bullet\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights\\". In 2011, Meredith, a 1969 graduate of Manhattan High School, was inducted in their \\"Wall of Fame\\" in a ceremony at the school. He was inducted along with guitarist Dwayne Bailey, who played with Bob Seger and Chicago. In 2015, Meredith was inducted in the Kansas Music Hall of Fame, as a member of the group Proto Kaw. The ceremony was held at the Opera House in Lawrence, Kansas. While away from professional music, Meredith served as an assistant football coach at Kansas State University, Panhandle State University, and Pittsburg State University. Later, he spent over fifteen years as color analyst for Pittsburg State football on KKOW (AM). Meredith is now Vice-President of Marketing and Communications for the NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics).

It is considered the city's most famous symbol.Schulte- Peevers 2007, p. 168. Completed in 1500, the roof was decorated with 2,657 fire-gilded copper tiles for Emperor Maximilian I to mark his wedding to Bianca Maria Sforza.Maier 1998, p. 270. The Emperor and his wife used the balcony to observe festivals, tournaments, and other events that took place in the square below. Description The entire oriel is decorated in sculpted reliefs and mural paintings. The first-floor balustrade is adorned with eight sculpted coats of arms, six facing the square and two flanking panels, representing Maximilian's territories.Parsons 2000, p. 367. Above the coats of arms are frescoes by J√∂rg K√∂lderer, painted in 1500, showing two knights bearing heraldic flags representing the Holy Roman Empire and Tyrol. The second-floor balustrade is decorated in eight sculpted reliefs, six facing the square and two flanking panels, depicting various images associated with Maximilian's life. The two central reliefs show Maximilian. The one on the left shows the Emperor with his second wife Bianca Maria Sforza on the left holding an apple, and his beloved first wife Maria of Burgundy on the right.Bousfield 2001, p. 467. The other central relief shows the Emperor with his court jester and his chancellor. The flanking reliefs show Moorish dancers engaged in \\"acrobatic and grotesque dancing\\"‚Äîa common form of popular entertainment of that time. The dancing shown in these outer reliefs is of Andalusian origin. The frescoes that adorn the interior of the loggia were also painted by J√∂rg K√∂lderer and show scenes from the aristocratic life of that time. All of the decorations on the current structure are carefully executed replicas. The original reliefs are on permanent display in the Tyrolean State Museum, known as the Ferdinandeum. History The building that bears the Goldenes Dachl was constructed by Archduke Friedrich IV in the early fifteenth century as the residence of the Tyrolean sovereigns. Emperor Maximilian I commissioned the loggia in 1493 from Nikolaus Turing the Elder, the Innsbruck court builder, at the time of his marriage to Bianca Maria Sforza. It was Turing who designed and built the \\"golden\\" roof with its 2,657 fire-gilded copper tiles. The Goldenes Dachl was designed to serve as a royal box where the Emperor and his imperial entourage could sit in state and enjoy festivals, tournaments, and other events that took place in the square below. The Goldenes Dachl was built in honor of Maximilian's marriage to Bianca Maria Sforza of Milan. Not wishing to alienate the allies gained by his first marriage, to Maria of Burgundy, he had an image of himself between the two women painted on his balcony. Since January 2003, the Goldenes Dachl has housed the International Alpine Convention's Office. The Alpine Convention is a coalition of eight Alpine Countries united by a shared commitment to sustainable development in the European Alps. A museum, the Maximilianum, is also contained in the building as well as the Innsbruck City Archives. In March 2017, Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif were on Goldenes Dachl as a part of the shooting of a romantic song ‚ÄúDil Diyan Gallan‚Äù which has more than 540 million YouTube views for the action packed spy romance Indian movie Tiger Zinda Hai produced by Yash Raj Films.

Hayden was born in Washington Parish, Louisiana, U.S. on April 7, 1839. He was the son of Allen and Nancy McLendon Hayden. S. A. Hayden married Mary Guion Relya on July 2, 1868 and five children were born to them. After service in the army of the Confederate States of America, he served as a pastor and teacher in Louisiana. He came to Texas in 1874. He pastored churches in Paris, Galveston, and Dallas. He purchased the newspaper Texas Baptist from Robert Cooke Buckner in 1883. Thereafter Hayden became a chief proponent of consolidating the five regional bodies, the two newspapers, and the two schools of Baptists in Texas. The consolidation of Baptist bodies was effected in 1886, with the formation of the Baptist General Convention of Texas. After this consolidation, Hayden purchased the other newspaper, J. B. Link's Texas Baptist Herald, and changed the name to Texas Baptist and Herald. J. Frank Norris bought the paper in 1907 and it was no longer published after 1908. Hayden and his paper played a major part in a controversy among Texas Baptists at the end of the 19th century. Hayden and others became convinced of financial mismanagement on the part of the corresponding secretary of the Convention and other improprieties associated with the missions board. Through his newspaper he waged war on those activities he thought improper. Hayden was denied a seat as a delegate at the 1897 State Convention, and was eventually expelled from it. This controversy led to the formation of the Baptist Missionary Association of Texas (see Baptist Missionary Association). This association was formed against the advice of Hayden, who wanted to continue the fight within the Convention. Hayden sued over his unseating, which resulted in two hung juries and two victories. Though the victories were appealed, the court actions ended in 1905, when J. B. Cranfill made an out of court settlement and paid $300 to Hayden. Samuel Augustus Hayden died in Dallas, Texas on October 10, 1918. References *A Texas Baptist Power Struggle: The Hayden Controversy, Joseph E.

With an ensemble cast led by Denise Richards, James Stevenson, Lauren German, Eric Balfour, Tamara Taylor, Lucas Bryant, and Omar Benson Miller, the series focuses on rich young adults living in Silver Lake, Los Angeles and their secrets involving sex and love. With the prominent use of voice-over narrations, the show took a documentary approach to framing the characters and their storylines. The series was developed as a vehicle and television debut for Richards, and had the working titles Wildlife and Sex, Lies, and Secrets. The episodes were filmed in Los Angeles. Sex, Love & Secrets was canceled after one season due to low viewership; six of its eight episodes were not aired on UPN. Universal HD broadcast the unaired episodes in 2008. It has not been released on home video or made available on streaming services. Critical response to Sex, Love & Secrets was mixed; some praised it as a guilty pleasure, though others felt the storylines and characters were unoriginal. Critics had mixed reviews for the show's content and style in comparison to other programs, such as Desperate Housewives, Melrose Place, and The O.C.. Premise Described as a \\"Generation Y soap opera\\" by critic John Kenneth Muir, Sex, Love & Secrets revolves around affluent young adults living in Silver Lake, Los Angeles and their secrets regarding love and sex. The Advocate's Richard Andreoli identified the group as \\"close friends\\", though the official website states that they act more like a family. One of the show's taglines was \\"the only thing that can come between them...is the truth\\". According to The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan, the show uses \\"National Geographic-esque footage\\" to pivot the characters and their storylines as \\"a study of human behavior\\" on lying and secrets. The series has voice-over narrations, and its lines include: \\"Be it Santa Claus, Twinkies, infidelity or murder, all humans keep secrets.\\" The narrator, voiced by Virginia Hamilton, talks about the characters and their storylines through \\"clinical terms\\". McFarland wrote that she speaks in \\"ominous tones\\", while other commentators found the voiceover similar to that of a Discovery Channel program. Some critics compared the narrator to Mary Alice Young from Desperate Housewives, while Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer likened her to Marty Stouffer's role on Wild America. Characters Publicist Jolene (Denise Richards) has a tense relationship with rock musician Hank (James Stevenson), who is planning to marry journalist Rose (Lauren German). As the lead singer of the band Modern Apes, Hank performs \\"mocking [and] self-congratulatory\\" versions of Barry Manilow's music. According to Tatiana Morales of CBS News, people compared Jolene to Amanda Woodward from Melrose Place. Muir characterized Jolene as a maneater, and Phil Gallo of Variety viewed her as \\"a devilish character with a dark soul\\". On the other hand, Shandy Casteel of PopMatters described Rose as the girl next door. David Bianculli of the New York Daily News cited her as the show's lead character. In the pilot episode, Rose receives the ashes of her ex-boyfriend Billy (Dylan Bruno), but it is revealed he is alive when he re-enters the characters' lives. Jolene believes that Rose had ruined her relationship with Billy, and responds by plotting to take Hank as \\"a means to nasty retaliation\\". As part of the show's comedy, Rose imagines people singing pop music to her. Hair stylist Charlie (Eric Balfour) has sex with Gabrielle (Katie Cassidy), his close friend Coop's (Omar Miller) girlfriend.Muir (2007): p. 118 Charlie looks to Warren Beatty's character from the 1975 film Shampoo as an inspiration for his life. He is portrayed as a \\"sexual dynamo\\", though he chooses to maintain a platonic relationship with Meg (Nadia Bjorlin). Meg was a recurring character on the series. The group frequently seeks advice from gynaecologist Nina (Tamara Taylor), characterized as a workaholic without a sex or social life. The hipster Milo (Lucas Bryant) becomes Nina's new roommate after she meets him through an online advertisement. Shandy Casteel wrote that Nina was a \\"vixen-waiting-to-flower\\" and felt Milo fulfilled the \\"creepy-geek-as-potential-killer clich√©\\". The group is typically shown at a bar. Executive producers Michael Gans and Richard Register said that storylines involving LGBT characters were planned. Production alt=A woman with long blonde hair with a grey dress smiles toward the camera. Sex, Love & Secrets was first announced as part of a September 7, 2004 press report, and developed under the working titles Wildlife and Sex, Lies, and Secrets. Brian Ford Sullivan wrote that the Wildlife title matched the documentary-style of the series, and Amy Amatangelo of The Gazette felt the Sex, Lies, and Secrets title was changed to avoid confusion with the 1989 film Sex, Lies, and Videotape. When talking about the second title change, executive producer Jonathan Axelrod said: \\"I've always felt we had more love than lies in the show.\\" Axelrod/Edwards Company and Paramount Network Television handled production. Jonathan Axelrod, Kelly Edwards, and Daniel Cerone worked as the show's executive producers, while its co-executive producers were Michael Gans and Richard Register. Along with being the series' creators, Gans and Register served as its primary writers. David Schwartz handled the music, and Caty Maxey and Brandy Alexander worked as the production designers. The casting process was overseen by Robin Lippin. Jolene was Richard's first role in a television series, and Richard Andreoli referred to Sex, Love & Secrets as her star vehicle. Richards was drawn to the character and script, explaining: \\"It was something I thought was so different and the character was different. It was definitely appealing to be shooting something at home.\\" Richards was pregnant during the filming of the pilot episode. When discussing balancing the filming schedule and motherhood, she said: \\"My children are my first priority, but it‚Äôs nice to have a balance between work and home. This is an ensemble show, so I‚Äôm not working every day.\\" Richards considered creating a nursery on the set. Brian Ford Sullivan wrote that Richards plays a smaller role than expected in the show despite her listing as the main actor. The episodes were shot in Los Angeles; David Straiton, Allison Liddi-Brown, and Rachel Talalay were a few of the primary directors. Shandy Casteel wrote that the series made frequent use of \\"rapid camera zooms, faded-out flashbacks, and quick cuts\\" and other types of \\"production flourishes\\". Phil Gallo described the direction as having \\"an intimate and racy feel\\" focused on colorful settings.  Episodes  Broadcast history Sex, Love & Secrets was broadcast initially on Tuesday nights at 9 pm EST on United Paramount Network (UPN). The episodes aired between September 27, 2005, and October 18, 2005. It was one of three new shows the network ordered for the 2005‚Äì06 United States network television schedule. The show's official website hosted preview videos and an interactive map of the Silver Lake community. Muir wrote that UPN intended to market the series to fans of Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place. Melanie McFarland considered Sex, Love & Secrets part of the network's plans to add more prime- time soap operas to its scheduling. The show was a TV14 rating for suggestive dialogue, sexual situations, and coarse or crude language. The pilot received \\"mixed reviews and weak viewership\\", having been watched by an average of 1.4 million people. Due to its poor reception and ratings, UPN canceled Sex, Love & Secrets after one episode aired. It had the lowest rating of any network television show that aired in the 2005-06 season. The network clarified that it would broadcast the remaining episodes that had been filmed, and might renew the show if ratings improved. UPN did not air six of the eight episodes. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or on any online-streaming service. Sex, Love & rated 155th out of 156 shows in the 2005‚Äì06 television schedule‚Äîabove only Get This Party Started. According to Muir, it fared poorly in every demographic. When talking about the cancellation, Balfour joked: \\"I LIKE doing shows that fail.\\" Gary Susman and Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the removal of Sex, Love & Secrets cut short Richards' television career. In 2008, Universal HD played the unaired episodes of Sex, Love & Secrets as part of its \\"Sexy Summer Sundays\\" along with episodes of South Beach. Critical reception Based on 16 reviews, Sex, Love & Secrets received a score from Metacritic of 41/100, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Phil Gallo praised the show as having \\"the potential to be a real guilty pleasure\\", and cited Jolene as its highlight. Gallo described Richards as conveying \\"the most dramatic presence\\" in the scenes, and wrote: \\"without her, the show would wither\\". Rob Owen also commended the series as \\"a little sleazy and a heck of a lot of guilty pleasure fun\\". A contributor for Zimbio responded positively to Lauren German‚Äôs performance, saying she \\"hit her stride by landing the lead role\\" in shows such as Sex, Love & Secrets. Brian Ford Sullivan praised Richard's performance as the only positive aspect of the series as she brings out its campy qualities. Reviewing the series, Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"It's skank-errific, if flawed.\\" Despite being critical of Sex, Love & Secrets, Aaron Barnhart of The Kansas City Star felt that it was not the worst example of a prime-time soap opera. Sex, Love & Secrets also garnered negative reactions from television critics. Shandy Casteel panned the series, writing that it relied on \\"stock characters in stock situations\\". Anita Gates criticized the narration as \\"vapid commentary [that] sets the tone for this vapid soap about vapid young single heterosexual friends\\". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that the characters acted out \\"every negative stereotype about LA\\". USA Todays Robert Bianco did not believe that Richards and Balfour's performances could carry the series. Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle summarized the pilot episode saying: \\"It's awful. Vote no.\\" A reviewer from Out criticized the show's tone, and wrote it was \\"too much mellow and not enough drama\\". Critics had mixed reviews for Sex, Love & Secrets, when compared to other television programs. Rob Owen identified it as a good replacement for Melrose Place fans, while Casteel described the series as an unsuccessful attempt to recreate it. Matthew Gilbert felt that its serious tone clashed with its intentions to become a guilty pleasure in the same vein as Melrose Place. Instead, The Wall Street Journals Nancy DeWolf Smith likened the show's storylines and tone to Desperate Housewives. Robert Bianco interpreted Sex, Love & Secrets as a shallow version of The O.C.. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times wrote that the show lacked \\"the self-aware wit\\" of The O.C. and the \\"over-the-top fun\\" of Melrose Place.

It lives in the understory in moist, rocky soils on river banks, ravines, woods, and cliffs. Although generally a rare tree, it is common in the inner coastal plain and Piedmont regions of Georgia. It is a small tree, reaching 8‚Äì9 m in height and developing a round form with slender branches, and often with multiple trunks. The name \\"chalk maple\\" (in addition to the Latin name, meaning \\"white skin\\") comes from the attractive smooth and thin chalky white or light gray bark on mature trees. The bark becomes ridged and blackish at the base as it ages. The leaves are opposite and simple, 5‚Äì9 cm long and broad, often drooping at the tip. They have 5 or 3 long-pointed lobes with wavy or coarsely toothed edges. They are dark green and hairless above, with a yellow-green and softly pubescent underside. In autumn, the leaves turn from a brilliant yellow to orange to deep red. The fruit is a paired brown samara, 2-2.5 cm long, maturing in autumn. Acer leucoderme is often confused with Acer floridanum (Florida maple), but there are several differences. A. leucoderme is smaller in size but has larger leaves than Florida maple. The leaves of A. leucoderme are yellow-green underneath rather than the whitish underside of Florida maple. The lobes on the leaves of Florida maple are squarer and blunter than those of A. leucoderme. Acer leucoderme can be grown as a shade tree or reclamation plant up through USDA plant hardiness zone 5B, far north of its natural range. The tree is highly shade- and drought-tolerant. Some botanists classify A. leucoderme as a subspecies of the sugar maple: A. saccharum subsp. leucoderme. References * Little, Elbert L.

Anchor Books) The American Monomyth is a 1977 book by Robert Jewett and John Shelton Lawrence arguing for the existence and cultural importance of an 'American Monomyth', a variation on the classical monomyth as proposed by Joseph Campbell. Campbell's monomyth describes a hero's journey: a hero ventures from the normal world into a supernatural one, winning a decisive victory there and returning with a 'boon'. In contrast, Jewett and Lawrence define the American monomyth as: > \\"A community in a harmonious paradise is threatened by evil; normal > institutions fail to contend with this threat; a selfless superhero emerges > to renounce temptations and carry out the redemptive task; aided by fate, > his decisive victory restores the community to its paradisiacal condition; > the superhero then recedes into obscurity.\\" In their 2002 book The Myth of the American Superhero (with Lawrence as first author) and their 2003 book Captain America And The Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma Of Zealous Nationalism (with Jewett as first author), the authors extend the thesis by using examples from both American popular culture and the American religious tradition.

Ward based on Nichols' novel of the same name. The ensemble cast includes Ruben Blades, Richard Bradford, S√¥nia Braga, Julie Carmen, James Gammon, Melanie Griffith, John Heard, Carlos Riquelme, Daniel Stern, Chick Vennera, and Christopher Walken. Filmed on location in Truchas, New Mexico, the film is set in the fictional rural town of Milagro, with a population of 426, a predominantly Hispanic and Catholic town, with a largely interrelated population. The film tells of one man's struggle as he defends his small beanfield and his community against much larger business and state political interests. Plot Nearly 500 residents of the agricultural community of Milagro in the mountains of northern New Mexico face a crisis when politicians and business interests make a backroom deal to usurp the town's water in order to pave the way for a land buy-out. Due to the new laws, Joe Mondragon is unable to make a living farming because he is not allowed to divert water from an irrigation ditch that runs past his property. Frustrated, and unable to find work, Joe visits his father's field. He happens upon a tag that reads \\"prohibited\\" covering a valve on the irrigation ditch. He kicks the valve, unintentionally breaking it, allowing water to flood his fields. He decides against repairing the valve and instead decides to plant beans in the field. This leads to a confrontation with powerful state interests, including a hired gun brought in from out of town. An escalation of events follows, leading to a final showdown between law enforcement and the citizens of Milagro.

Some locals responded favorably, but many objected to the idea of big business changing the small community, which forced Redford to film the movie in Truchas. In his essay, \\"Night of the Living Beanfield: How an Unsuccessful Cult Novel Became an Unsuccessful Cult Film in Only Fourteen Years, Eleven Nervous Breakdowns, and $20 Million,\\" John Nichols gives an account of the film project as he saw it. Nichols also described the origin of the novel and the making of the film in the biographical documentary, The Milagro Man: The Irrepressible Multicultural Life and Literary Times of John Nichols, which premiered at the 2012 Albuquerque Film Festival. Reception Redford filmed in Truchas, New Mexico. =Box office= The film's premiere in three cities was called \\"risky\\" and \\"disappointing\\" by industry analysts. =Critical response= Melanie Griffith, Robert Redford and S√¥nia Braga promoting the film at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival The film received mixed reviews from critics. Vincent Canby, film critic for The New York Times, believes the film missed its mark, and wrote, \\"The screenplay, by David Ward and John Nichols, based on Mr. Nichols's novel, is jammed with underdeveloped, would-be colorful characters, including a philosophical Chicano angel, who face a succession of fearful confrontations with the law that come to nothing. The narrative is a veritable fiesta of anticlimaxes, from the time the sun sets at the beginning of the film until it sets, yet again, behind the closing credits.\\" Roger Ebert also gave the film a mixed review and had problems with the film's context, writing, \\"The result is a wonderful fable, but the problem is, some of the people in the story know it's a fable and others do not. This causes an uncertainty that runs all through the film, making it hard to weigh some scenes against others. There are characters who seem to belong in an angry documentary‚Äîlike Devine, who wants to turn Milagro into a plush New Mexico resort town. And then there are characters who seem to come from a more fanciful time, like Mondragon, whose original rebellion is more impulsive than studied.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, April 1, 1988. Accessed: August 19, 2013. Critic Richard Scheib liked the film's direction and the characters portrayed. He wrote, \\"Redford arrays a colorfully earthy ensemble of characters. The plot falls into place with lazy, deceptive ease. Redford places it up against a gently barbed level of social commentary, although this is something that comes surprisingly light-heartedly. There‚Äôs an enchantment to the film ‚Äì at times it is a more successful version of the folklore fable that Francis Ford Coppola's Finian's Rainbow (1968) tried to be but failed.\\" Scheib believes the film is \\"one of the first American films to fall into the Latin American tradition of magical realism. This is a genre that usually involves an earthily naturalistic, often highly romanticized, blend of the supernatural and whimsical.\\"Scheib, Richard. Film review, archived at The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review, no date. Accessed: August 19, 2013. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 59% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 32 reviews.

Talabani wrote his poetry in Kurdish , Persian, and Arabic. Most of his poetry consist of Satire, Ribaldry, Flyting and creative insults. The poet in one of his famous poems recalled his childhood in the Kurdish Emirate of Baban before it was ruled by either the Persians or the Ottomans. As a young man of age twenty-five or so, the poet went to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople (Istanbul), and in the course of his journey, he visited the grave of the Kurdish Sufi, Sheikh Nurredin Brifkani. At the graveside he recited a long poem in Persian, telling of how he had journeyed from Kurdish Emirate of Sharazur, of which Kirkuk was its capital, to visit The Country of the Rom. In 1879, when the Ottoman Empire annexed the Wilayah of Sharazur to the Wilayah of Mosul, Riza expressed his sadness and disappointment in a poem, in Turkish, in which he told the people that Mosul had now become the capital of their Wilayah and Nafi‚Äôi Effendi was the Wali. Riza Talabani is one of the foremost Kurdish poets.

Many Jewish Bibles in both Hebrew and English (including the 1917 Jewish Publication Society Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text, the New Jewish Publication Society Tanakh, and the ArtScroll Chumash) use the numbering of the Upper Trope Marks system as used for public readings.

The Sabbath is one of the Ten Commandments. commands that one remember the Sabbath day, keep it holy, and not do any manner of work or cause anyone under one's control to work, for in six days God made heaven and earth and rested on the seventh day, blessed the Sabbath, and hallowed it. Deuteronomy 5:12‚Äì15 in NJPS. commands that one observe the Sabbath day, keep it holy, and not do any manner of work or cause anyone under one's control to work ‚Äî so that one's subordinates might also rest ‚Äî and remember that the Israelites were servants in the land of Egypt, and God brought them out with a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. In the incident of the manna (, man) in , Moses told the Israelites that the Sabbath is a solemn rest day; prior to the Sabbath one should cook what one would cook, and lay up food for the Sabbath. And God told Moses to let no one go out of one's place on the seventh day. In , just before giving Moses the second Tablets of Stone, God commanded that the Israelites keep and observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a sign between God and the children of Israel forever, for in six days God made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day God rested. In , just before issuing the instructions for the Tabernacle, Moses again told the Israelites that no one should work on the Sabbath, specifying that one must not kindle fire on the Sabbath. In , God told Moses to repeat the Sabbath commandment to the people, calling the Sabbath a holy convocation. The prophet Isaiah taught in that iniquity is inconsistent with the Sabbath. In , the prophet taught that if people turn away from pursuing or speaking of business on the Sabbath and call the Sabbath a delight, then God will make them ride upon the high places of the earth and will feed them with the heritage of Jacob. And in , the prophet taught that in times to come, from one Sabbath to another, all people will come to worship God. The prophet Jeremiah taught in that the fate of Jerusalem depended on whether the people abstained from work on the Sabbath, refraining from carrying burdens outside their houses and through the city gates. The prophet Ezekiel told in how God gave the Israelites God's Sabbaths, to be a sign between God and them, but the Israelites rebelled against God by profaning the Sabbaths, provoking God to pour out God's fury upon them, but God stayed God's hand. In , Nehemiah told how he saw some treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and others bringing all manner of burdens into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, so when it began to be dark before the Sabbath, he commanded that the city gates be shut and not opened till after the Sabbath and directed the Levites to keep the gates to sanctify the Sabbath. The Altar ,Exodus 20:22 in NJPS. which prohibits building the altar from hewn stones, explaining that wielding tools upon the stones would profane them, is echoed by , which prohibits wielding iron tools over the stones of the altar and requires that the Israelites build the altar from unhewn stones. Mattathias appealing to Jewish refugees (illustration by Gustave Dor√© from the 1866 La Sainte Bible) In early nonrabbinic interpretation The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these early nonrabbinic sources:For more on early nonrabbinic interpretation, see, e.g., Esther Eshel, ‚ÄúEarly Nonrabbinic Interpretation,‚Äù in Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, editors, Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition, pages 1841‚Äì59. =Exodus chapter 20= The Sabbath told how in the 2nd century BCE, many followers of the pious Jewish priest Mattathias rebelled against the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Antiochus's soldiers attacked a group of them on the Sabbath, and when the Pietists failed to defend themselves so as to honor the Sabbath (commanded in, among other places, ), a thousand died. reported that when Mattathias and his friends heard, they reasoned that if they did not fight on the Sabbath, they would soon be destroyed. So they decided that they would fight against anyone who attacked them on the Sabbath.Jonathan A. Goldstein, translator, I Maccabees (New York: Doubleday and Company, 1976), pages 5, 234‚Äì35. In classical rabbinic interpretation The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud:For more on classical rabbinic interpretation, see, e.g., Yaakov Elman, ‚ÄúClassical Rabbinic Interpretation,‚Äù in Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, editors, Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition, pages 1859‚Äì78. =Exodus chapter 18= The Harlot of Jericho and the Two Spies (watercolor circa 1900 by James Tissot) The Tannaim debated what news Jethro heard in that caused him to adopt the faith of Moses. Rabbi Joshua said that Jethro heard of the Israelites' victory over the Amalekites, as reports the results of that battle immediately before reports Jethro's hearing of the news. Rabbi Eleazar of Modim said that Jethro heard of the giving of the Torah, for when God gave Israel the Torah, the sound travelled from one end of the earth to the other, and all the world's kings trembled in their palaces and sang, as Psalm reports, \\"The voice of the Lord makes the hinds to tremble . . . and in His temple all say: 'Glory.'\\" The kings then converged upon Balaam and asked him what the tumultuous noise was that they had heard ‚Äî perhaps another flood, or perhaps a flood of fire. Balaam told them that God had a precious treasure in store, which God had hidden for 974 generations before the creation of the world, and God desired to give it to God's children, as says, \\"The Lord will give strength to His people.\\" Immediately they all exclaimed the balance of \\"The Lord will bless His people with peace.\\" Rabbi Eleazar said that Jethro heard about the dividing of the Reed Sea, as reports, \\"And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites heard how the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel,\\" and Rahab the harlot too told Joshua's spies in \\"For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea.\\"Babylonian Talmud Zevachim 116a (Sasanian Empire, 6th century), in, e.g., Talmud Bavli: Tractate Zevachim: Volume 3, elucidated by Israel Schneider, Yosef Widroff, Mendy Wachsman, Dovid Katz, Zev Meisels, and Feivel Wahl, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1996), volume 57, page 116a4; see also Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Amalek, chapter 3 (Land of Israel, late 4th century), in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1933, reissued 2004), volume 2, pages 271‚Äì72. Rabbi Joshua interpreted to teach that Jethro sent a messenger to Moses. Noting that mentions each of Jethro, Zipporah, and Moses' children, Rabbi Eliezer taught that Jethro sent Moses a letter asking Moses to come out to meet Jethro for Jethro's sake; and should Moses be unwilling to do so for Jethro's sake, then to do so for the Zipporah's sake; and should Moses be reluctant to do so for her sake, then to do so the sake of Moses' children.Exodus Rabbah 17:2 (10th century), in, e.g., Simon M. Lehrman, translator, Midrash Rabbah: Exodus (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 3, page 322. Rabbi Pappias read the words \\"And Jethro said: 'Blessed be the Lord'\\" in as a reproach to the Israelites, for not one of the 600,000 Israelites rose to bless God until Jethro did.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Amelek, chapter 3, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de- Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 279. Reading , \\"Moses sat to judge the people from the morning to the evening,\\" the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael questioned whether Moses really sat as a judge that long. Rather, the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael suggested that the similarity of to taught that whoever renders a true judgment is accounted as a coworker with God in the work of creation. For says, \\"from the morning to the evening,\\" and says, \\"And there was evening and there was morning.\\"Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Amelek, chapter 4, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 281. A Midrash expounded on the role of Moses as a judge in . Interpreting God's command in , the Sages told that when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he saw Aaron beating the Golden Calf into shape with a hammer. Aaron really intended to delay the people until Moses came down, but Moses thought that Aaron was participating in the sin and was incensed with him. So God told Moses that God knew that Aaron's intentions were good. The Midrash compared it to a prince who became mentally unstable and started digging to undermine his father's house. His tutor told him not to weary himself but to let him dig. When the king saw it, he said that he knew the tutor's intentions were good, and declared that the tutor would rule over the palace. Similarly, when the Israelites told Aaron in , ‚ÄúMake us a god,‚Äù Aaron replied in , ‚ÄúBreak off the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.‚Äù And Aaron told them that since he was a priest, they should let him make it and sacrifice to it, all with the intention of delaying them until Moses could come down. So God told Aaron that God knew Aaron's intention, and that only Aaron would have sovereignty over the sacrifices that the Israelites would bring. Hence in , God told Moses, ‚ÄúAnd bring near Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that they may minister to Me in the priest's office.‚Äù The Midrash told that God told this to Moses several months later in the Tabernacle itself when Moses was about to consecrate Aaron to his office. Rabbi Levi compared it to the friend of a king who was a member of the imperial cabinet and a judge. When the king was about to appoint a palace governor, he told his friend that he intended to appoint the friend's brother. So God made Moses superintendent of the palace, as reports, ‚ÄúMy servant Moses is . . . is trusted in all My house,‚Äù and God made Moses a judge, as reports, ‚ÄúMoses sat to judge the people.‚Äù And when God was about to appoint a High Priest, God notified Moses that it would be his brother Aaron.Exodus Rabbah 37:2, in, e.g., Simon M. Lehrman, translator, Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, volume 3, pages 444‚Äì45. Rabbi Berekiah taught in the name of Rabbi Hanina that judges must possess seven qualities, and enumerates four: \\"Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain.\\" And mentions the other three: They must be \\"wise men, and understanding, and full of knowledge.\\" Scripture does not state all seven qualities together to teach that if people possessing all the seven qualities are not available, then those possessing four are selected; if people possessing four qualities are not available, then those possessing three are selected; and if even these are not available, then those possessing one quality are selected, for as says, \\"A woman of valor who can find?\\"Deuteronomy Rabbah 1:10 (Land of Israel, 9th century), in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 7, pages 8‚Äì9. At the Foot of Mount Sinai, They Set Up Camp (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) =Exodus chapter 19= The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael deduced from the use of the singular form of the verb \\"encamped\\" (vayichan, ) in that all the Israelites agreed and were of one mind.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 1, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de- Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 295. Noting that reports, \\"they encamped in the desert,\\" the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that the Torah was given openly, in a public place, for if it had been given in the Land of Israel, the Israelites could say to the nations of the world that they had no portion in it. But it was given openly, in a public place, and all who want to take it may come and take it. It was not given at night, as reports, \\"And it was on the third day, when it was morning . . . .\\" It was not given in silence, as reports, \\"and there were thunders and lightnings.\\" It was not given inaudibly, as reports, \\"And all the people saw the thunders and the lightnings.\\"Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 1, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, pages 293‚Äì94. A Midrash taught that God created the world so that the upper realms should be for the upper beings, and the lower realms for the lower, as says, ‚ÄúThe heavens are the heavens of the Lord, but the earth has He given to the children of men.‚Äù Then Moses changed the earthly into heavenly and the heavenly into earthly, for as reports, ‚ÄúMoses went up to God,‚Äù and then reports, ‚ÄúThe Lord came down upon Mount Sinai.‚ÄùDeuteronomy Rabbah 10:2, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, volume 7, page 165. Rabbi Eliezer interpreted the words, \\"And how I bore you on eagles' wings,\\" in to teach that God rapidly gathered all the Israelites and brought them to Rameses.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 2, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 296. And the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael further deduced from that the Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth in the twinkling of an eye.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Pisha, chapter 14, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de- Rabbi Ishmael, volume 1, page 74. The Promulgation of the Law in Mount Sinai (illustration from the 1728 Figures de la Bible) Reading the words, \\"And how I bore you on eagles' wings,\\" in , the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that eagles differ from all other birds because other birds carry their young between their feet, being afraid of other birds flying higher above them. Eagles, however, fear only people who might shoot arrows at them from below. Eagles, therefore, prefer that the arrows hit them rather than their children. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael compared this to a man who walked on the road with his son in front of him. If robbers, who might seek to capture his son, come from in front, the man puts his son behind him. If a wolf comes from behind, the man puts his son in front of him. If robbers come from in front and wolves from behind, the man puts his son on his shoulders. As says, \\"You have seen how the Lord your God bore you, as a man bears his son.\\"Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 2, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 296‚Äì97. Reading , a Midrash taught that God did not conduct God's Self with the Israelites in the usual manner. For usually when one acquired servants, it was on the understanding that the servants drew the master's carriage. God, however, did not do so, for God bore the Israelites, for in , God says to the Israelites, \\"I bore you on eagles' wings.\\"Exodus Rabbah 20:11, in, e.g., Simon M. Lehrman, translator, Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, volume 3, page 252; see also Exodus Rabbah 25:6, in, e.g., Simon M. Lehrman, translator, Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, volume 3, pages 306‚Äì07. A Midrash likened God to a bridegroom and Israel to a bride, and taught that reports that God betrothed Israel at Sinai. The Midrash noted that the Rabbis taught that documents of betrothal and marriage are written only with the consent of both parties, and the bridegroom pays the scribe's fee.See Mishnah Bava Batra 10:4 (Land of Israel, circa 200 CE), in, e.g., Jacob Neusner, translator, The Mishnah: A New Translation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), page 580; Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 167b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli: Tractate Bava Basra: Volume 3, elucidated by Yosef Asher Weiss, edited by Hersh Goldwurm (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1994), volume 46, page 167b1; see also Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 102b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli: Tractate Kesubos: Volume 3, elucidated by Abba Zvi Naiman, Avrohom Neuberger, Dovid Kamenetsky, Yosef Davis, Henoch Moshe Levin, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000), volume 28, page 102b2; Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 9b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli: Tractate Kiddushin: Volume 1, elucidated by David Fohrman, Dovid Kamenetsky, and Hersh Goldwurm, edited by Hersh Goldwurm (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1992), volume 36, page 9b1. The Midrash then taught that God betrothed Israel at Sinai, reading to say, ‚ÄúAnd the Lord said to Moses: ‚ÄòGo to the people and betroth them today and tomorrow.‚Äô‚Äù The Midrash taught that in , God commissioned Moses to write the document, when God directed Moses, ‚ÄúCarve two tables of stone.‚Äù And reports that Moses wrote the document, saying, ‚ÄúAnd Moses wrote this law.‚Äù The Midrash then taught that God compensated Moses for writing the document by giving him a lustrous countenance, as reports, ‚ÄúMoses did not know that the skin of his face sent forth beams.‚ÄùDeuteronomy Rabbah 3:12, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 81. In the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi ·∏§anina told that in the third month, the day is double the night, and the Israelites slept until two hours of the day, for sleep on the day of the feast of Shavuot is pleasant, as the night is short. Moses went to the camp and aroused the Israelites from their sleep, for God desired to give them the Torah. says, \\"And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God,\\" and God also went forth to meet them, like a bridegroom who goes forth to meet his bride.Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 41 (circa 750 CE), in, e.g., Gerald Friedlander, translator, Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer (London, 1916, reprinted New York: Hermon Press, 1970), page 322. The Mishnah noted that oxen were the same as all other beasts insofar as they were required by to keep away from Mount Sinai.Mishnah Bava Kamma 5:7, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner. The Gemara cited to explain how Moses decided to abstain from marital relations so as to remain pure for his communication with God. A Baraita taught that Moses did three things of his own understanding, and God approved: (1) Moses added one day of abstinence of his own understanding; (2) he separated himself from his wife (entirely, after the Revelation); and (3) he broke the Tablets of Stone (on which God had written the Ten Commandments). The Gemara explained that to reach his decision to separate himself from his wife, Moses applied an a fortiori (kal va-chomer) argument to himself. Moses noted that even though the Shechinah spoke with the Israelites on only one definite, appointed time (at Mount Sinai), God nonetheless instructed in , \\"Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.\\" Moses reasoned that if he heard from the Shechinah at all times and not only at one appointed time, how much more so should he abstain from marital contact. And the Gemara taught that we know that God approved, because in (5:27 in NJPS), God instructed Moses (after the Revelation at Sinai), \\"Go say to them, 'Return to your tents'\\" (thus giving the Israelites permission to resume marital relations) and immediately thereafter in (5:28 in NJPS), God told Moses, \\"But as for you, stand here by me\\" (excluding him from the permission to return). And the Gemara taught that some cite as proof of God's approval God's statement in , \\"with him [Moses] will I speak mouth to mouth\\" (as God thus distinguished the level of communication God had with Moses, after Miriam and Aaron had raised the marriage of Moses and then questioned the distinctiveness of the prophecy of Moses).Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 87a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part Two. Commentary by Adin Even- Israel (Steinsaltz) (Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012), volume 3, page 27. The Mishnah deduced from that a woman who emits semen on the third day after intercourse is unclean.Mishnah Shabbat 9:3, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 86a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part Two, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 3, page 23. The Rabbis compared the Israelites' encounter at Sinai to Jacob's dream in . The \\"ladder\\" in Jacob's dream symbolizes Mount Sinai. That the ladder is \\"set upon (, mutzav) the earth\\" recalls , which says, \\"And they stood (, vayityatzvu) at the nether part of the mount.\\" The words of , \\"and the top of it reached to heaven,\\" echo those of , \\"And the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven.\\" \\"And behold the angels of God\\" alludes to Moses and Aaron. \\"Ascending\\" parallels \\"And Moses went up to God.\\" \\"And descending\\" parallels \\"And Moses went down from the mount.\\" And the words \\"and, behold, the Lord stood beside him\\" in parallel the words of \\"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai.\\"Genesis Rabbah 68:12. Land of Israel, 5th century. in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 624‚Äì25. London: Soncino Press, 1939. Moses on Mount Sinai (painting circa 1895‚Äì1900 by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me) Rabbi Levi addressed the question that raises: \\"Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?\\" (, in turn, refers back to the encounter at Sinai reported at , , and after.) Rabbi Levi taught that the world would not have been able to survive hearing the voice of God in God's power, but instead, as says, \\"The voice of the Lord is with power.\\" That is, the voice of God came according to the power of each individual ‚Äî young, old, or infant ‚Äî to receive it.Exodus Rabbah 29:1. in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 337. Reading the words \\"And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount\\" in , the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael supposed that one might think that God actually descended from heaven and transferred God's Presence to the mountain. Thus the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael noted that (20:19 in NJPS) says: \\"You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven,\\" and deduced that God bent down the heavens, lowering them to the top of the mountain, and spread the heavens as a person spreads a mattress on a bed, and spoke from the heavens as a person would speak from the top of a mattress.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 4, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, pages 309‚Äì10. Moses Receiving the Tablets of the Law (fresco by Raphael circa 1518‚Äì1519 at the Apostolic Palace, Rome) Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that when Moses ascended on high (as reports), the ministering angels asked God what business one born of woman had among them. God told them that Moses had come to receive the Torah. The angels questioned why God was giving to flesh and blood the secret treasure that God had hidden for 974 generations before God created the world. The angels asked, in the words of , \\"What is man, that You are mindful of him, and the son of man, that You think of him?\\" God told Moses to answer the angels. Moses asked God what was written in the Torah. In , God said, \\"I am the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the Land of Egypt.\\" So Moses asked the angels whether the angels had gone down to Egypt or were enslaved to Pharaoh. As the angels had not, Moses asked them why then God should give them the Torah. Again, says, \\"You shall have no other gods,\\" so Moses asked the angels whether they lived among peoples that engage in idol worship. Again, (20:8 in NJPS) says, \\"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\\" so Moses asked the angels whether they performed work from which they needed to rest. Again, (20:7 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,\\" so Moses asked the angels whether there were any business dealings among them in which they might swear oaths. Again, (20:12 in NJPS) says, \\"Honor your father and your mother,\\" so Moses asked the angels whether they had fathers and mothers. Again, (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal,\\" so Moses asked the angels whether there was jealousy among them and whether the Evil Tempter was among them. Immediately, the angels conceded that God's plan was correct, and each angel felt moved to love Moses and give him gifts. Even the Angel of Death confided his secret to Moses, and that is how Moses knew what to do when, as reports, Moses told Aaron what to do to make atonement for the people, to stand between the dead and the living, and to check the plague.Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 88b‚Äì89a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part Two, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 3, pages 34‚Äì35. Saint Moses (1638 painting by Jusepe de Ribera at the Museo nazionale di San Martino, Naples) =Exodus chapter 20= In the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Tarfon taught that God came from Mount Sinai (or others say Mount Seir) and was revealed to the children of Esau, as says, ‚ÄúThe Lord came from Sinai, and rose from Seir to them,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSeir‚Äù means the children of Esau, as says, ‚ÄúAnd Esau dwelt in Mount Seir.‚Äù God asked them whether they would accept the Torah, and they asked what was written in it. God answered that it included (in (20:13 in NJPS) and (5:17 in NJPS)), ‚ÄúYou shall do no murder.‚Äù The children of Esau replied that they were unable to abandon the blessing with which Isaac blessed Esau in , ‚ÄúBy your sword shall you live.‚Äù From there, God turned and was revealed to the children of Ishmael, as says, ‚ÄúHe shined forth from Mount Paran,‚Äù and ‚ÄúParan‚Äù means the children of Ishmael, as says of Ishmael, ‚ÄúAnd he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran.‚Äù God asked them whether they would accept the Torah, and they asked what was written in it. God answered that it included (in (20:13 in NJPS) and (5:17 in NJPS)), ‚ÄúYou shall not steal.‚Äù The children of Ishamel replied that they were unable to abandon their fathers' custom, as Joseph said in (referring to the Ishamelites' transaction reported in ), ‚ÄúFor indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews.‚Äù From there, God sent messengers to all the nations of the world asking them whether they would accept the Torah, and they asked what was written in it. God answered that it included (in (20:3 in NJPS) and (5:7 in NJPS)), ‚ÄúYou shall have no other gods before me.‚Äù They replied that they had no delight in the Torah, therefore let God give it to God's people, as says, ‚ÄúThe Lord will give strength [identified with the Torah] to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.‚Äù From there, God returned and was revealed to the children of Israel, as says, ‚ÄúAnd he came from the ten thousands of holy ones,‚Äù and the expression ‚Äúten thousands‚Äù means the children of Israel, as says, ‚ÄúAnd when it rested, he said, ‚ÄòReturn, O Lord, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.‚Äô‚Äù With God were thousands of chariots and 20,000 angels, and God‚Äôs right hand held the Torah, as says, ‚ÄúAt his right hand was a fiery law to them.‚ÄùPirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 41, in, e.g., Gerald Friedlander, translator, Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, pages 318‚Äì20. Moses and Aaron with the Ten Commandments (painting circa 1675 by Aron de Chavez) Reading , ‚ÄúAnd God spoke all these words, saying,‚Äù the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that God spoke the ten commandments in one utterance, in a manner of speech of which human beings are incapable.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Shirata, chapter 8, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 1, page 208. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that with every single word that God spoke (as reports), the Israelites' souls departed, as Song of Songs says: \\"My soul went forth when He spoke.\\" But if their souls departed at the first word, how could they receive the second word? God revived them with the dew with which God will resurrect the dead, as says, \\"You, O God, did send a plentiful rain; You did confirm your inheritance, when it was weary.\\" Rabbi Joshua ben Levi also taught that with every word that God spoke, the Israelites retreated a distance of 12 mils, but the ministering angels led them back, as says, \\"The hosts of angels march, they march (, yiddodun yiddodun).\\" Instead of yiddodun (\\"they march\\"), Rabbi Joshua ben Levi read yedaddun (\\"they lead\\").Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 88b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part Two, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 3, page 34. Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that when God gave the Torah, no bird twittered, no fowl flew, no ox lowed, none of the Ophanim stirred a wing, the Seraphim did not say (in the words of ) ‚ÄúHoly, Holy,‚Äù the sea did not roar, the creatures did not speak, the whole world was hushed into breathless silence and the voice went forth in the words of and ‚ÄúI am the Lord your God.‚ÄùExodus Rabbah 29:9, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 344. Rabbi Levi explained that God said the words of and , ‚ÄúI am the Lord your God,‚Äù to reassure Israel that just because they heard many voices at Sinai, they should not believe that there are many deities in heaven, but rather they should know that God alone is God. Rabbi Tobiah bar Isaac read the words of and , ‚ÄúI am the Lord your God,‚Äù to teach that it was on the condition that the Israelites acknowledged God as their God that God (in the continuation of and ) ‚Äúbrought you out of the land of Egypt.‚Äù And a Midrash compared ‚ÄúI am the Lord your God‚Äù to a princess who having been taken captive by robbers, was rescued by a king, who subsequently asked her to marry him. Replying to his proposal, she asked what dowry the king would give her, to which the king replied that it was enough that he had rescued her from the robbers. (So God's delivery of the Israelites from Egypt was enough reason for the Israelites to obey God's commandments.)Exodus Rabbah 29:3, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 338. Decalogue (1768 parchment by Jekuthiel Sofer) Rabbi Levi said that the section beginning at was spoken in the presence of the whole Israelite people, because it includes each of the Ten Commandments, noting that: (1) says, \\"I am the Lord your God,\\" and says, \\"I am the Lord your God\\"; (2) says, \\"You shall have no other gods,\\" and says, \\"Nor make to yourselves molten gods\\"; (3) (20:7 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,\\" and says, \\"And you shall not swear by My name falsely\\"; (4) (20:8 in NJPS) says, \\"Remember the Sabbath day,\\" and says, \\"And you shall keep My Sabbaths\\"; (5) (20:12 in NJPS) says, \\"Honor your father and your mother,\\" and says, \\"You shall fear every man his mother, and his father\\"; (6) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not murder,\\" and says, \\"Neither shall you stand idly by the blood of your neighbor\\"; (7) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not commit adultery,\\" and says, \\"Both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death; (8) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not steal,\\" and says, \\"You shall not steal\\"; (9) (20:13 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not bear false witness,\\" and says, \\"You shall not go up and down as a talebearer\\"; and (10) (20:14 in NJPS) says, \\"You shall not covet . . . anything that is your neighbor's,\\" and says, \\"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\\"Leviticus Rabbah 24:5 (Land of Israel, 5th century), in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 4, pages 307‚Äì08. The Mishnah taught that the priests recited the Ten Commandments daily.Mishnah Tamid 5:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Tamid 32b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Avrohom Neuberger, Nasanel Kasnett, Abba Zvi Naiman, Henoch Moshe Levin, Eliezer Lachman, and Ari Lobel, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2004), volume 70, page 32b. The Gemara, however, taught that although the Sages wanted to recite the Ten Commandments along with the Shema in precincts outside of the Temple, they soon abolished their recitation, because the Sages did not want to lend credence to the arguments of the heretics (who might argue that Jews honored only the Ten Commandments).Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 12a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz) (Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012), volume 1, pages 76‚Äì77. Exodus 20:1‚Äì5 in a manuscript from the British Library Rabbi Ishmael interpreted (20:2‚Äì3 in NJPS) and (5:6‚Äì7 in NJPS) to be the first of the Ten Commandments. Rabbi Ishmael taught that Scripture speaks in particular of idolatry, for says, ‚ÄúBecause he has despised the word of the Lord.‚Äù Rabbi Ishmael interpreted this to mean that an idolater despises the first word among the Ten Words or Ten Commandments in (20:2‚Äì3 in NJPS) and (5:6‚Äì7 in NJPS), ‚ÄúI am the Lord your God . . . . You shall have no other gods before Me.‚ÄùSifre to Numbers 112:4:3 (Land of Israel, circa 250‚Äì350 CE.) in, e.g., Sifr√© to Numbers: An American Translation and Explanation, translated by Jacob Neusner (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1986), volume 2, page 170. The Gemara taught that the Israelites heard the words of the first two commandments (in (20:3‚Äì6 in NJPS) and (5:7‚Äì10 in NJPS)) directly from God. Rabbi Simlai expounded that a total of 613 commandments were communicated to Moses ‚Äî 365 negative commandments, corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, and 248 positive commandments, corresponding to the number of the parts in the human body. Rav Hamnuna said that one may derive this from , \\"Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.\\" The letters of the word \\"Torah\\" () have a numerical value of 611 (as equals 400, equals 6, equals 200, and equals 5). And the Gemara did not count among the commandments that the Israelites heard from Moses the commandments, \\"I am the Lord your God,\\" and, \\"You shall have no other gods before Me,\\" as the Israelites heard those commandments directly from God.Babylonian Talmud Makkot 23b‚Äì24a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, revised and enlarged edition, 2001), volume 50, page 24a. The Sifre taught that to commit idolatry is to deny the entire Torah.Sifre to Numbers 111:1:3, in, e.g., Sifr√© to Numbers: An American Translation and Explanation, translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2. Tractate Avodah Zarah in the Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, and Babylonian Talmud interpreted the laws prohibiting idolatry in (20:3‚Äì6 in NJPS) and (5:7‚Äì10 in NJPS).Mishnah Avodah Zarah 1:1‚Äì5:12, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Tosefta Avodah Zarah 1:1‚Äì8:8 (Land of Israel, circa 250 CE), in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction, translated by Jacob Neusner (Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson Publishers, 2002); Jerusalem Talmud Avodah Zarah 1a‚Äì (Tiberias, Land of Israel, circa 400 CE), in, e.g., The Jerusalem Talmud: A Translation and Commentary, edited by Jacob Neusner and translated by Jacob Neusner, Tzvee Zahavy, B.

The Mishnah taught that those who engaged in idol worship were executed, whether they served it, sacrificed to it, offered it incense, made libations to it, prostrated themselves to it, accepted it as a god, or said to it \\"You are my god.\\" But those who embraced, kissed, washed, anointed, clothed, or swept or sprinkled the ground before an idol merely transgressed the negative commandment of (20:5 in NJPS) and were not executed.Mishnah Sanhedrin 7:6, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 60b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Michoel Weiner and Asher Dicker, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1994), volume 48, page 60b. The Gemara reconciled apparently discordant verses touching on vicarious responsibility. The Gemara noted that states: \\"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin,\\" but (20:5 in NJPS) says: \\"visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children.\\" The Gemara cited a Baraita that interpreted the words \\"the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them\\" in to teach that God punishes children only when they follow their parents' sins. The Gemara then questioned whether the words \\"they shall stumble one upon another\\" in do not teach that one will stumble through the sin of the other, that all are held responsible for one another. The Gemara answered that the vicarious responsibility of which speaks is limited to those who have the power to restrain their fellow from evil but do not do so.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 27b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Asher Dicker and Abba Zvi Naiman, edited by Hersh Goldwurm (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1993), volume 47, page 27b.

Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012. The Mishnah interpreted the prohibition of animals working in (20:10 in NJPS) to teach that on the Sabbath, animals could wear their tethers, and their caretakers could lead them by their tethers and sprinkle or immerse them with water.Mishnah Shabbat 5:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 51b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part One, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz) (Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012), volume 2, page 243. The Mishnah taught that a donkey could go out with a saddle cushion tied to it, rams strapped, ewes covered, and goats with their udders tied. Rabbi Jose forbade all these, except covering ewes. Rabbi Judah allowed goats to go out with their udders tied to dry, but not to save their milk.Mishnah Shabbat 5:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 52b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part One, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 2, page 249. The Mishnah taught that animals could not go out with a pad tied to their tails. A driver could not tie camels together and pull one of them, but a driver could take the leads of several camels in hand and pull them.Mishnah Shabbat 5:3, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 54a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part One, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 2, pages 256‚Äì57. The Mishnah prohibited donkeys with untied cushions, bells, ladder‚Äìshaped yokes, or thongs around their feet; fowls with ribbons or leg straps; rams with wagons; ewes protected by wood chips in their noses; calves with little yokes; and cows with hedgehog skins or straps between their horns. The Mishnah reported that Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah's cow used to go out with a thong between its horns, but without the consent of the Rabbis.Mishnah Shabbat 5:4, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 54b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ¬∑ Part One, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 2, pages 258‚Äì59. myrtle The Gemara reported that on the eve of the Sabbath before sunset, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and his son saw an old man running with two bundles of myrtle and asked him what they were for. The old man explained that they were to bring a sweet smell to his house in honor of the Sabbath. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai asked whether one bundle would not be enough. The old man replied that one bundle was for ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù in (20:8 in NJPS) and one was for ‚ÄúObserve‚Äù in (5:12 in NJPS). Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai told his son to mark how precious the commandments are to Israel.Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 33b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Asher Dicker, Nasanel Kasnett, and David Fohrman, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1996), volume 3, page 33b4. A Midrash cited the words of (20:10 in NJPS), ‚ÄúAnd your stranger who is within your gates,‚Äù to show God's injunction to welcome the stranger. The Midrash compared the admonition in , ‚ÄúNeither let the alien who has joined himself to the Lord speak, saying: ‚ÄòThe Lord will surely separate me from his people.‚Äô‚Äù (Isaiah enjoined Israelites to treat the convert the same as a native Israelite.) Similarly, the Midrash quoted , in which Job said, ‚ÄúThe stranger did not lodge in the street‚Äù (that is, none were denied hospitality), to show that God disqualifies no creature, but receives all; the city gates were open all the time and anyone could enter them. The Midrash equated , ‚ÄúThe stranger did not lodge in the street,‚Äù with the words of (20:10 in NJPS), (5:14 in NJPS), and , ‚ÄúAnd your stranger who is within your gates‚Äù (which implies that strangers were integrated into the midst of the community). Thus the Midrash taught that these verses reflect the Divine example of accepting all creatures.Exodus Rabbah 19:4, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 232. A Midrash employed the words of (20:10 in NJPS), (5:14 in NJPS), and , ‚ÄúAnd your stranger who is within your gates,‚Äù to reconcile the command of , ‚ÄúAnd the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: ‚ÄòThis is the ordinance of the Passover: No alien shall eat thereof,‚Äù with the admonition of , ‚ÄúNeither let the alien who has joined himself to the Lord speak, saying: ‚ÄòThe Lord will surely separate me from his people.‚Äô‚Äù (Isaiah enjoins us to treat the convert the same as a native Israelite.) The Midrash quoted , in which Job said, ‚ÄúThe stranger did not lodge in the street‚Äù (that is, none were denied hospitality), to show that God disqualifies no one, but receives all; the city gates were open all the time and anyone could enter them. The Midrash equated , ‚ÄúThe stranger did not lodge in the street,‚Äù with the words of (20:10 in NJPS), (5:14 in NJPS), and , ‚ÄúAnd your stranger who is within your gates,‚Äù which imply that strangers were integrated into the community. Thus these verses reflect the Divine example of accepting all. Rabbi Berekiah explained that in , Job said, ‚ÄúThe stranger did not lodge in the street,‚Äù because strangers will one day be ministering priests in the Temple, as says: ‚ÄúAnd the stranger shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave (, venispechu) to the house of Jacob,‚Äù and the word ‚Äúcleave‚Äù (, venispechu) always refers to priesthood, as says, ‚ÄúPut me (, sefacheini), I pray you, into one of the priests‚Äô offices.‚Äù The Midrash taught that strangers will one day partake of the showbread, because their daughters will be married into the priesthood.Exodus Rabbah 19:4, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus, translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 231‚Äì34. Rav Judah taught in Rav's name that the words of (5:12 in NJPS), ‚ÄúObserve the Sabbath day . . . as the Lord your God commanded you‚Äù (in which Moses used the past tense for the word ‚Äúcommanded,‚Äù indicating that God had commanded the Israelites to observe the Sabbath before the revelation at Mount Sinai) indicate that God commanded the Israelites to observe the Sabbath when they were at Marah, about which reports, ‚ÄúThere He made for them a statute and an ordinance.‚ÄùBabylonian Talmud Shabbat 87b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Shabbat ‚Ä¢ Part Two, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 3, page 29. The Mishnah taught that every act that violates the law of the Sabbath also violates the law of a festival, except that one may prepare food on a festival but not on the Sabbath.Mishnah Beitzah 5:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Beitzah 36b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Yisroel Reisman, edited by Hersh Goldwurm (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1991), volume 17, page 36b; see also Mishnah Megillah 1:5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Megillah 7b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Gedaliah Zlotowitz and Hersh Goldwurm, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1991), volume 20, page 7b. The Tanna Devei Eliyahu taught that if you live by the commandment establishing the Sabbath (in (20:8 in NJPS) and (5:12 in NJPS)), then (in the words of ) ‚ÄúThe Lord has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength: ‚ÄòSurely I will no more give your corn to be food for your enemies.‚Äù If, however, you transgress the commandment, then it will be as in , when ‚Äúthe Lord‚Äôs anger was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying: ‚ÄòSurely none of the men . . . shall see the land.‚Äô‚ÄùTanna Devei Eliyahu, Seder Eliyyahu Rabbah, chapter (26) 24, page 130 (10th century), in, e.g., Tanna Debe Eliyyahu: The Lore of the School of Elijah, translated by William G. Braude and Israel J. Kapstein (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1981), page 283. The Alphabet of Rabbi Akiva taught that when God was giving Israel the Torah, God told them that if they accepted the Torah and observed God‚Äôs commandments, then God would give them for eternity a most precious thing that God possessed ‚Äî the World To Come. When Israel asked to see in this world an example of the World To Come, God replied that the Sabbath is an example of the World To Come.Alphabet of Rabbi Akiva (circa 700), quoted in Abraham Joshua Heschel, The Sabbath (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1951), page 73. A Midrash asked to which commandment refers when it says, \\"For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment that I command you, to do it, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him, then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.\\" Rabbi Levi said that \\"this commandment\\" refers to the recitation of the Shema (), but the Rabbis said that it refers to the Sabbath, which is equal to all the precepts of the Torah.Deuteronomy Rabbah 4:4, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, page 91. Honor Your Father and Your Mother (illustration from an 1896 Bible card) Honor Your Father and Your Mother (illustration from a 1908 Bible card) The Mishnah taught that both men and women are obligated to carry out all commandments concerning their fathers.Mishnah Kiddushin 1:7, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 29a, 30b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Kiddushin, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 22, pages 151, 161. Rav Judah interpreted the Mishnah to mean that both men and women are bound to perform all precepts concerning a father that are incumbent upon a son to perform for his father.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Kiddushin, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 22, page 161. A Midrash noted that almost everywhere, Scripture mentions a father's honor before the mother's honor. (See, for example, (20:12 in NJPS), (5:16 in NJPS), .) But mentions the mother first to teach that one should honor both parents equally.Genesis Rabbah 1:15, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, pages 13‚Äì14. It was taught in a Baraita that Judah the Prince said that God knows that a son honors his mother more than his father, because the mother wins him over with words. Therefore, (in (20:12 in NJPS)) God put the honor of the father before that of the mother. God knows that a son fears his father more than his mother, because the father teaches him Torah. Therefore, (in ) God put the fear of the mother before that of the father.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30b‚Äì31a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Kiddushin, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 22, page 162. Our Rabbis taught in a Baraita what it means to \\"honor\\" and \\"revere\\" one's parents within the meaning of (20:12 in NJPS) (honor), (revere), and (5:16 in NJPS) (honor). To \\"revere\\" means that the child must neither stand nor sit in the parent's place, nor contradict the parent's words, nor engage in a dispute to which the parent is a party. To \\"honor\\" means that the child must give the parent food and drink and clothes, and take the parent in and out.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 31b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Kiddushin, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 22, page 168. Noting that (20:12 in NJPS) commands, \\"Honor your father and your mother,\\" and directs, \\"Honor the Lord with your substance,\\" the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that Scripture thus likens the honor due to parents to that due to God. Similarly, as commands, \\"You shall fear your father and mother,\\" and commands, \\"The Lord your God you shall fear and you shall serve,\\" Scripture likens the fear of parents to the fear of God. And as commands, \\"He that curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death,\\" and commands, \\"Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin,\\" Scripture likens cursing parents to cursing God. But the Baraita conceded that with respect to striking (which addresses with regard to parents), that it is certainly impossible (with respect to God). The Baraita concluded that these comparisons between parents and God are only logical, since the three (God, the mother, and the father) are partners in creation of the child. For the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that there are three partners in the creation of a person ‚Äî God, the father, and the mother. When one honors one's father and mother, God considers it as if God had dwelt among them and they had honored God. And a Tanna taught before Rav Nachman that when one vexes one's father and mother, God considers it right not to dwell among them, for had God dwelt among them, they would have vexed God.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30b‚Äì31a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Kiddushin, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 22, pages 162‚Äì63. Chapter 9 of Tractate Sanhedrin in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud interpreted the laws of murder in (20:13 in NJPS) and (5:17 in NJPS).Mishnah Sanhedrin 9:1‚Äì5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 602‚Äì04; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 76b‚Äì81b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Michoel Weiner and Asher Dicker, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 48, page 76b2‚Äì81b3. The Mishnah taught that one who intended to kill an animal but killed a person instead was not liable for murder. One was not liable for murder who intended to kill an unviable fetus and killed a viable child. One was not liable for murder who intended to strike the victim on the loins, where the blow was insufficient to kill, but struck the heart instead, where it was sufficient to kill, and the victim died. One was not liable for murder who intended to strike the victim on the heart, where it was enough to kill, but struck the victim on the loins, where it was not, and yet the victim died.Mishnah Sanhedrin 9:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 602‚Äì03; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 78b‚Äì79a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Michoel Weiner and Asher Dicker, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 48, page 78b3‚Äì79a1. Interpreting the consequences of murder (prohibited in (20:13 in NJPS) and (5:17 in NJPS)), the Mishnah taught that God created the first human (Adam) alone to teach that Scripture imputes guilt to one who destroys a single soul of Israel as though that person had destroyed a complete world, and Scripture ascribes merit to one who preserves a single soul of Israel as though that person had preserved a complete world.Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 591; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 37a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Asher Dicker and Abba Zvi Naiman, edited by Hersh Goldwurm, volume 47, page 37a3. The Tanna Devei Eliyahu taught that if you live by the commandment prohibiting murder (in (20:13 in NJPS) and (5:17 in NJPS)), then (in the words of ) ‚Äúthe sword shall not go through your land.‚Äù If, however, you transgress the commandment, then (in God's words in ) ‚ÄúI will draw out the sword after you.‚ÄùTanna Devei Eliyahu, Seder Eliyyahu Rabbah, chapter (26) 24, page 131, in, e.g., Tanna Debe Eliyyahu: The Lore of the School of Elijah, translated by William G. Braude and Israel J. Kapstein, page 283. Rabbi Josiah taught that we learn the formal prohibition against kidnapping from the words \\"You shall not steal\\" in (20:13 in NJPS) (since and merely state the punishment for abduction). Rabbi Johanan taught that we learn it from , \\"They shall not be sold as bondsmen.\\" The Gemara harmonized the two positions by concluding that Rabbi Josiah referred to the prohibition for abduction, while Rabbi Johanan referred to the prohibition for selling a kidnapped person. Similarly, the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that (20:13 in NJPS), \\"You shall not steal,\\" refers to the stealing of human beings. To the potential objection that (20:13 in NJPS) refers to property theft, the Baraita responded that one of the thirteen principles by which we interpret the Torah is that a law is interpreted by its general context, and the Ten Commandments speak of capital crimes (like murder and adultery). (Thus \\"You shall not steal\\" must refer to a capital crime and thus to kidnapping.) Another Baraita taught that the words \\"You shall not steal\\" in refer to theft of property. To the potential objection that refers to the theft of human beings, the Baraita responded that the general context of speaks of money matters; therefore must refer to monetary theft.Babylonian Talmud Talmud Sanhedrin 86a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Asher Dicker, Joseph Elias, and Dovid Katz, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1995), volume 49, page 86a3; see also Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 8, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 334. Moses Led Them Out of the Camp To Meet God (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) According to the Mishnah, if witnesses testified that a person was liable to receive 40 lashes, and the witnesses turned out to have perjured themselves, then Rabbi Meir taught that the perjurers received 80 lashes ‚Äî 40 on account of the commandment of (20:13 in NJPS) not to bear false witness and 40 on account of the instruction of to do to perjurers as they intended to do to their victims ‚Äî but the Sages said that they received only 40 lashes.Mishnah Makkot 1:3, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner; Babylonian Talmud Makkot 4a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, revised and enlarged edition, 2001), volume 50. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish taught that the commandment of (20:13 in NJPS) not to bear false witness included every case of false testimony.Jerusalem Talmud Terumot 64a, in, e.g., The Jerusalem Talmud: A Translation and Commentary, edited by Jacob Neusner and translated by Jacob Neusner, Tzvee Zahavy, B. Barry Levy, and Edward Goldman. Rav Aha of Difti said to Ravina that one can transgress the commandment not to covet in (20:14 in NJPS) and (5:18 in NJPS) even in connection with something for which one is prepared to pay.Babylonian Talmud Bava Metzia 5b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, edited by Hersh Goldwurm (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1992), volume 41, page 5b3. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael asked whether the commandment not to covet in (20:14 in NJPS) applied so far as to prohibit merely expressing one's desire for one's neighbor's things in words. But the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael noted that says, \\"You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself.\\" And the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael reasoned that just as in the word \\"covet\\" applies only to prohibit the carrying out of one's desire into practice, so also (20:14 in NJPS) prohibits only the carrying out of one's desire into practice.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 8, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 337. Rabbi Akiva (illustration from the 1568 Mantua Haggadah) The Mekhilta of Rabbi Simeon distinguished the prohibition of (20:14 in NJPS), \\"You shall not covet,\\" from that of (5:18 in NJPS), \\"neither shall you desire.\\" The Mekhilta of Rabbi Simeon taught that the differing terms mean that one can incur liability for desiring in and of itself and for coveting in and of itself.Mekhilta of Rabbi Simeon, Tractate Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 55 (Land of Israel, 5th century), in, e.g., Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai, translated by W. David Nelson (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 2006), page 251. Rabbi Ishmael interpreted the words \\"all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the horn\\" in (20:15 in NJPS) to mean that the people saw what could be seen and heard what could be heard. But Rabbi Akiva said that they saw and heard what was perceivable, and they saw the fiery word of God strike the tablets.Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Ba·∏•odesh, chapter 9, in, e.g., Jacob Z. Lauterbach, translator, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, volume 2, page 338. The Gemara taught that (20:17 in NJPS) sets forth one of the three most distinguishing virtues of the Jewish People. The Gemara taught that David told the Gibeonites that the Israelites are distinguished by three characteristics: They are merciful, bashful, and benevolent. They are merciful, for says that God would \\"show you (the Israelites) mercy, and have compassion upon you, and multiply you.\\" They are bashful, for (20:17 in NJPS) says \\"that God's fear may be before you (the Israelites).\\" And they are benevolent, for says of Abraham \\"that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice.\\" The Gemara taught that David told the Gibeonites that only one who cultivates these three characteristics is fit to join the Jewish People.Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 79a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Yevamot ¬∑ Part Two, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz) (Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2014), volume 15, page 65. A Midrash likened the commandment of to have just weights and measures to that of (20:20 in NJPS) not to make gods of silver, or gods of gold. Reading , Rabbi Levi taught that blessed actions bless those who are responsible for them, and cursed actions curse those who are responsible for them. The Midrash interpreted the words of , \\"A perfect and just weight you shall have,\\" to mean that if one acts justly, one will have something to take and something to give, something to buy and something to sell. Conversely, the Midrash read to teach, \\"You shall not have possessions if there are in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small. You shall not have possessions if there are in your house diverse measures, a great and a small.\\" Thus, if one does employ deceitful measures, one will not have anything to take or give, to buy or sell. The Midrash taught that God tells businesspeople that they \\"may not make\\" one measure great and another small, but if they do, they \\"will not make\\" a profit. The Midrash likened this commandment to that of (20:20 in NJPS) \\"You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make,\\" for if a person did make gods of silver and gold, then that person would not be able to afford to have even gods of wood or stone.Leviticus Rabbah 15:7, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 4, pages 194‚Äì95. The altar (illustration from Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia (1906‚Äì1913)) The Mishnah told that the stones of the Temple's altar and ramp came from the valley of Beit Kerem. When retrieving the stones, they dug virgin soil below the stones and brought whole stones that iron never touched, as required by and , because iron rendered stones unfit for the altar just by touch. A stone was also unfit if it was chipped through any means. They whitewashed the walls and top of the altar twice a year, on Passover and Sukkot, and they whitewashed the vestibule once a year, on Passover. Rabbi (Judah the Patriarch) said that they cleaned them with a cloth every Friday because of blood stains. They did not apply the whitewash with an iron trowel, out of the concern that the iron trowel would touch the stones and render them unfit, for iron was created to shorten humanity's days, and the altar was created to extend humanity's days, and it is not proper that that which shortens humanity's days be placed on that which extends humanity's days.Mishnah Middot 3:4, in, e.g., Jacob Neusner, translator, Mishnah, pages 878‚Äì79. The Tosefta reported that Rabban Jo·∏•anan ben Zakkai said that singled out iron, of all metals, to be invalid for use in building the altar because one can make a sword from it. The sword is a sign of punishment, and the altar is a sign of atonement. They thus kept that which is a sign of punishment away from that which is a sign of atonement. Because stones, which do not hear or speak, bring atonement between Israel and God, says, ‚Äúyou shall lift up no iron tool upon them.‚Äù So children of Torah, who atone for the world ‚Äî how much more should no force of injury come near to them.Tosefta Bava Kamma 7:6, in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction, translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 987. Similarly, says, ‚ÄúYou shall build the altar of the Lord your God of unhewn stones.‚Äù Because the stones of the altar secure the bond between Israel and God, God said that they should be whole before God. Children of Torah, who are whole for all time ‚Äî how much more should they be deemed whole (and not wanting) before God.Tosefta Bava Kamma 7:7, in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction, translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, pages 987‚Äì88. The brazen altar at the tabernacle (illustration from the 1890 Peter Fjellstedts Bibel) The Mishnah deduced from (20:21 in NJPS) that even when only a single person sits occupied with Torah, the Shechinah is with the student.Mishnah Avot 3:6, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner. Rabbi Isaac taught that God reasoned that if God said in (20:21 in NJPS), \\"An altar of earth you shall make to Me [and then] I will come to you and bless you,\\" thus revealing God's Self to bless the one who built an altar in God's name, then how much more should God reveal God's Self to Abraham, who circumcised himself for God's sake. And thus, \\"the Lord appear to him.\\"Genesis Rabbah 48:4, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, page 407. Bar Kappara taught that every dream has its interpretation. Thus Bar Kappara taught that the \\"ladder\\" in Jacob's dream of symbolizes the stairway leading up to the altar in the Temple in Jerusalem. \\"Set upon the earth\\" implies the altar, as (20:21 in NJPS) says, \\"An altar of earth you shall make for Me.\\" \\"And the top of it reached to heaven\\" implies the sacrifices, the odor of which ascended to heaven. \\"The angels of God\\" symbolize the High Priests. \\"Ascending and descending on it\\" describes the priests ascending and descending the stairway of the altar. And the words \\"and, behold, the Lord stood beside him\\" in once again invoke the altar, as in , the prophet reports, \\"I saw the Lord standing beside the altar.\\" In medieval Jewish interpretation The parashah is discussed in these medieval Jewish sources:For more on medieval Jewish interpretation, see, e.g., Barry D. Walfish, ‚ÄúMedieval Jewish Interpretation,‚Äù in The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition, edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, pages 1891‚Äì1915. Moses Maimonides (1744 portrait from Blaisio Ugolino) =Exodus chapter 18= Interpreting together with , Maimonides taught that judges must be on the highest level of righteousness. An effort should be made that they be white- haired, of impressive height, of dignified appearance, and people who understand whispered matters and who understand many different languages so that the court will not need to hear testimony from an interpreter.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah: Hilchot Sanhedrin veha‚ÄôOnashin haMesurin lahem, chapter 2, ¬∂ 6 (Egypt, circa 1170‚Äì1180), in, e.g., Mishneh Torah: Sefer Shoftim, translated by Eliyahu Touger (New York: Moznaim Publishing, 2001), pages 24‚Äì25. Maimonides taught that one need not demand that a judge for a court of three possess all these qualities, but a judge must, however, possess seven attributes: wisdom, humility, fear of God, loathing for money, love for truth, being beloved by people at large, and a good reputation. Maimonides cited , ‚ÄúMen of wisdom and understanding,‚Äù for the requirement of wisdom. continues, ‚ÄúBeloved by your tribes,‚Äù which Maimonides read to refer to those who are appreciated by people at large. Maimonides taught that what will make them beloved by people is conducting themselves with a favorable eye and a humble spirit, being good company, and speaking and conducting their business with people gently. Maimonides read , ‚Äúmen of power,‚Äù to refer to people who are mighty in their observance of the commandments, who are very demanding of themselves, and who overcome their evil inclination until they possess no unfavorable qualities, no trace of an unpleasant reputation, even during their early adulthood, they were spoken of highly. Maimonides read , ‚Äúmen of power,‚Äù also to imply that they should have a courageous heart to save the oppressed from the oppressor, as reports, ‚ÄúAnd Moses arose and delivered them.‚Äù Maimonides taught that just as Moses was humble, so, too, every judge should be humble. continues ‚ÄúGod-fearing,‚Äù which is clear. mentions ‚Äúmen who hate profit,‚Äù which Maimonides took to refer to people who do not become overly concerned even about their own money; they do not pursue the accumulation of money, for anyone who is overly concerned about wealth will ultimately be overcome by want. continues ‚Äúmen of truth,‚Äù which Maimonides took to refer to people who pursue justice because of their own inclination; they love truth, hate crime, and flee from all forms of crookedness.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah: Hilchot Sanhedrin veha‚ÄôOnashin haMesurin lahem, chapter 2, ¬∂ 7, in, e.g., Mishneh Torah: Sefer Shoftim, translated by Eliyahu Touger, pages 24‚Äì27. =Exodus chapter 20= Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda argued that because the wholehearted acceptance of the unity of God is the root and foundation of Judaism, God's first words to the Israelites at Mount Sinai in (20:2‚Äì3 in NJPS) and (5:6‚Äì7 in NJPS) were: \\"I am the Lord your God . . . you shall not have other gods before Me,\\" and then God exhorted the Israelites through Moses, saying in : \\"Hear O Israel the Lord, is our God, the Lord is One.\\"Ba·∏•ya ibn Paquda, Chovot HaLevavot (Duties of the Heart), section 1 (Zaragoza, Al-Andalus, circa 1080), in, e.g., Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda, Duties of the Heart, translated by Yehuda ibn Tibbon and Daniel Haberman (Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 1996), volume 1, pages 62‚Äì63. Interpreting the prohibition of coveting in (20:14 in NJPS) and desiring in (5:18 in NJPS), Maimonides taught that any person who covets a servant, a maidservant, a house, or utensils that belong to a colleague, or any other article that the person can purchase from the colleague and pressures the colleague with friends and requests until the colleague agrees to sell, violates a negative commandment, even though the person pays much money for it, as (20:14 in NJPS) says, \\"Do not covet.\\" Maimonides taught that the violation of this commandment was not punished by lashes, because it does not involve a deed. Maimonides taught that a person does not violate (20:14 in NJPS) until the person actually takes the article that the person covets, as reflected by \\"Do not covet the gold and silver on these statues and take it for yourself.\\" Maimonides read the word for \\"covet\\" in both (20:14 in NJPS) and to refer to coveting accompanied by a deed. Maimonides taught that a person who desires a home, a spouse, utensil, or anything else belonging to a colleague that the person can acquire violates a negative commandment when the person thinks in the person's heart how it might be possible to acquire this thing from the colleague. Maimonides read (5:18 in NJPS), \\"Do not desire,\\" to refer even to feelings in the heart alone. Thus, a person who desires another person's property violates one negative commandment. A person who purchases an object the person desires after pressuring the owners and repeatedly asking them, violates two negative commandments. For that reason, Maimonides concluded, the Torah prohibits both desiring in (5:18 in NJPS) and coveting in (20:14 in NJPS). And if the person takes the article by robbery, the person violates three negative commandments.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sefer Mezikin, Hilkhot Gezelah va- Avedah, chapter 1, halachot 9‚Äì12, in, e.g., Mishneh Torah: Sefer Mezikin, translated by Eliyahu Touger (New York: Moznaim, Publishing, 1997), pages 238‚Äì40. Isaac Abravanel noted that the order of (20:14 in NJPS), \\"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife,\\" differs from that in (5:18 in NJPS), \\"Neither shall you covet thy neighbor's wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor's house.\\" Abravanel deduced that (20:14 in NJPS) mentions the things that might be coveted in the order that a person has need of them, and what it behooves a person to try to acquire in this world. Therefore, the first coveted item mentioned is a person's house, then the person's spouse, then the person's servants, and lastly the person's animals that do not speak. (5:18 in NJPS), however, mentions them in the order of the gravity of the sin and evil. The most evil coveting is that of another person's spouse, as in David's coveting of Bathsheba. Next in magnitude of evil comes coveting the house in which one's neighbor lives, lest the person evict the neighbor and take the neighbor's home. Next comes the neighbor's field, for although a person does not live there as in the house, it is the source of the neighbor's livelihood and inheritance, as in the affair of Ahab and the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. After the field (5:18 in NJPS) mentions servants, who Abravanel valued of lesser importance than one's field. Next come the neighbor's animals, who do not have the faculty of speech, and lastly, to include the neighbor's inanimate moveable property, (5:18 in NJPS) says \\"and anything that is your neighbor's.\\"Isaac Abravanel, Commentary on the Torah, quoted in Judah Zoldan, \\"Is Marketing Coveting? (August 13, 2011). Maimonides taught that God told the Israelites to erect the altar to God's name in (20:21 in NJPS) and instituted the practice of sacrifices generally as transitional steps to wean the Israelites off of the worship of the times and move them toward prayer as the primary means of worship. Maimonides noted that in nature, God created animals that develop gradually. For example, when a mammal is born, it is extremely tender, and cannot eat dry food, so God provided breasts that yield milk to feed the young animal, until it can eat dry food. Similarly, Maimonides taught, God instituted many laws as temporary measures, as it would have been impossible for the Israelites suddenly to discontinue everything to which they had become accustomed. So God sent Moses to make the Israelites (in the words of ) ‚Äúa kingdom of priests and a holy nation.‚Äù But the general custom of worship in those days was sacrificing animals in temples that contained idols. So God did not command the Israelites to give up those manners of service, but allowed them to continue. God transferred to God's service what had formerly served as a worship of idols, and commanded the Israelites to serve God in the same manner ‚Äî namely, to build to a Sanctuary (), to erect the altar to God's name ( (20:21 in NJPS), to offer sacrifices to God (), to bow down to God, and to burn incense before God. God forbad doing any of these things to any other being and selected priests for the service in the temple in . By this Divine plan, God blotted out the traces of idolatry, and established the great principle of the Existence and Unity of God. But the sacrificial service, Maimonides taught, was not the primary object of God's commandments about sacrifice; rather, supplications, prayers, and similar kinds of worship are nearer to the primary object. Thus God limited sacrifice to only one temple (see ) and the priesthood to only the members of a particular family. These restrictions, Maimonides taught, served to limit sacrificial worship, and kept it within such bounds that God did not feel it necessary to abolish sacrificial service altogether. But in the Divine plan, prayer and supplication can be offered everywhere and by every person, as can be the wearing of tzitzit () and tefillin (, 16) and similar kinds of service.Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, part 3, chapter 32 (Cairo, Egypt, 1190), in, e.g., Moses Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, translated by Michael Friedl√§nder (New York: Dover Publications, 1956), pages 322‚Äì27. In modern interpretation The parashah is discussed in these modern sources: John Davenport (1670 painting in the Yale University Art Gallery) =Exodus chapter 18= The 1639 Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony reported that John Davenport, a Puritan clergyman and co-founder of the colony, declared to all the free planters forming the colony that and described the kind of people who might best be trusted with matters of government, and the people at the meeting assented without opposition.The Fundamental Agreement or Original Constitution of the Colony of New Haven, June 4, 1639, in Philip B. Kurland and Ralph Lerner, editors, The Founders' Constitution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), volume 5, pages 45‚Äì46. Gunther Plaut The 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut observed that in , the people ‚Äî not Moses, as recorded in and 24‚Äì25 ‚Äî chose the officials who would share the tasks of leadership and dispute resolution.W. Gunther Plaut, The Torah: A Modern Commentary: Revised Edition, revised edition edited by David E.S. Stern (New York: Union for Reform Judaism, 2006), page 1163. Jeffrey Tigay, Professor Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, however, reasoned that although Moses selected the appointees as recorded in and 24‚Äì25, he could not have acted without recommendations by the people, for the officers would have numbered in the thousands (according to the Talmud, 78,600), and Moses could not have known that many qualified people, especially as he had not lived among the Israelites before the Exodus.Jeffrey H. Tigay, The JPS Torah Commentary: Deuteronomy: The Traditional Hebrew Text with the New JPS Translation (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1996), page 11. Professor Robert Alter of the University of California, Berkeley, noted several differences between the accounts in and , all of which he argued reflected the distinctive aims of Deuteronomy. Jethro conceives the scheme in , but is not mentioned in , and instead, the plan is entirely Moses's idea, as Deuteronomy is the book of Moses. In , Moses entrusts the choice of magistrates to the people, whereas in , he implements Jethro's directive by choosing the judges himself. In , the qualities to be sought in the judges are moral probity and piety, whereas stresses intellectual discernment.Robert Alter, The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary (New York: W.W. Norton, 2004), page 881. =Exodus chapter 19= Noting that Jewish tradition has not preserved a tradition about Mount Sinai's location, Plaut observed that had the Israelites known the location in later centuries, Jerusalem and its Temple could never have become the center of Jewish life, for Jerusalem and the Temple would have been inferior in holiness to the God's mountain. Plaut concluded that Sinai thus became in Judaism, either by design or happenstance, a concept rather than a place.W. Gunther Plaut, The Torah: A Modern Commentary: Revised Edition, revised edition edited by David E.S. Stern, page 468. Shakespeare Professor Harold Fisch, formerly of Bar-Ilan University, argued that the revelation at Mount Sinai beginning at is echoed in Prince Hamlet‚Äôs meeting with his dead father‚Äôs ghost in I, scene 5 of William Shakespeare‚Äôs play Hamlet. Fisch noted that in both cases, a father appears to issue a command, only one is called to hear the command, others stay at a distance in terror, the commandment is recorded, and the parties enter into a covenant.Harold Fisch, The Biblical Presence in Shakespeare, Milton, and Blake: A Comparative Study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999), pages 86‚Äì87. Alter translated to call for ‚Äúan indigo twist‚Äù on the Israelites' garments. Alter explained that the dye was not derived from a plant, as is indigo, but from a substance secreted by the murex, harvested off the coast of Phoenicia. The extraction and preparation of this dye were labor-intensive and thus quite costly. It was used for royal garments in many places in the Mediterranean region, and in Israel it was also used for priestly garments and for the cloth furnishings of the Tabernacle. Alter argued that the indigo twist indicated the idea that Israel should become (in the words of ) a ‚Äúkingdom of priests and a holy nation‚Äù and perhaps also that, as the covenanted people, metaphorically God's firstborn, the nation as a whole had royal status.Robert Alter, The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary, page 760. Professor Maxine Grossman of the University of Maryland, College Park, noted that in God told Moses, ‚ÄúGo to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes and prepare for the third day,‚Äù but then in Moses told the people, ‚ÄúPrepare for the third day; do not go near a woman.‚Äù Did God evince a different conception of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù (including women) than Moses (apparently speaking only to men)? Or does Moses‚Äôs statement reveal a cultural bias of the Biblical author?Maxine Grossman, ‚ÄúReading the Bible,‚Äù lecture in the class on ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament,‚Äù at the University of Maryland, January 30, 2019. Moshe Greenberg of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem wrote that one may see the entire Exodus story as ‚Äúthe movement of the fiery manifestation of the divine presence.‚ÄùMoshe Greenberg, Understanding Exodus (New York: Behrman House, 1969), pages 16‚Äì17. Similarly, Professor William Propp of the University of California, San Diego, identified fire (, esh) as the medium in which God appears on the terrestrial plane ‚Äî in the Burning Bush of , the cloud pillar of and , atop Mount Sinai in and , and upon the Tabernacle in .William H.C. Propp. Exodus 1‚Äì18: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, volume 2, page 36. New York: Anchor Bible, 1998. Professor Everett Fox of Clark University noted that ‚Äúglory‚Äù (, kevod) and ‚Äústubbornness‚Äù (, kaved lev) are leading words throughout the book of Exodus that give it a sense of unity.Everett Fox, The Five Books of Moses (Dallas: Word Publishing, 1995), page 245. Similarly, Propp identified the root kvd ‚Äî connoting heaviness, glory, wealth, and firmness ‚Äî as a recurring theme in Exodus: Moses suffered from a heavy mouth in and heavy arms in Pharaoh had firmness of heart in , 28; , 34; and Pharaoh made Israel's labor heavy in God in response sent heavy plagues in , 18, 24; and , so that God might be glorified over Pharaoh in , 17, and 18; and the book culminates with the descent of God's fiery Glory, described as a ‚Äúheavy cloud,‚Äù first upon Sinai and later upon the Tabernacle in , 22; and . =Exodus chapter 20= Although Jewish tradition came to consider the words ‚ÄúI am the Lord your God‚Äù in the first of the Ten Commandments, many modern scholars saw not a command, but merely a proclamation announcing the Speaker.E.g., Umberto Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Exodus (Jerusalem, 1951), translated by Israel Abrahams (Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, The Hebrew University, 1967), page 241; Nahum M. Sarna, The JPS Torah Commentary: Exodus: The Traditional Hebrew Text with the New JPS Translation (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1991), page 109 (‚Äúroyal, self-identifying formula‚Äù); Richard Elliott Friedman, Commentary on the Torah: With a New English Translation (New York: Harper San Francisco, 2001), page 235 (‚Äúintroductory statement‚Äù); Robert Alter, The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary, page 429 (‚Äúformal announcement of the identity of the sovereign whose authority underwrites what is to follow‚Äù); W.

Tigay, ‚ÄúExodus,‚Äù in The Jewish Study Bible, edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, page 139 (‚Äúan introduction‚Äù). In 1980, in the case of Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court of the United States held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute that required posting the Ten Commandments on the wall of each public classroom in the state. The Court noted that some of the Commandments apply to arguably secular matters, such those at (20:12‚Äì17 in NJPS) and (5:16‚Äì21 in NJPS), on honoring one's parents, murder, adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness. But the Court also observed that the first part of the Commandments, in (20:1‚Äì11 in NJPS) and (5:6‚Äì15 in NJPS), concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day. Thus the Court concluded that the pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls was plainly religious.Stone v. Graham, . In 1950, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism ruled: ‚ÄúRefraining from the use of a motor vehicle is an important aid in the maintenance of the Sabbath spirit of repose. Such restraint aids, moreover, in keeping the members of the family together on the Sabbath. However where a family resides beyond reasonable walking distance from the synagogue, the use of a motor vehicle for the purpose of synagogue attendance shall in no wise be construed as a violation of the Sabbath but, on the contrary, such attendance shall be deemed an expression of loyalty to our faith. . . . [I]n the spirit of a living and developing Halachah responsive to the changing needs of our people, we declare it to be permitted to use electric lights on the Sabbath for the purpose of enhancing the enjoyment of the Sabbath, or reducing personal discomfort in the performance of a mitzvah.‚ÄùMorris Adler, Jacob B.

Decalogue (from the Nash Papyrus) According to Sefer ha- Chinuch, there are 3 positive and 14 negative commandments in the parashah:Sefer HaHinnuch: The Book of [Mitzvah] Education, translated by Charles Wengrov (Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 1991), volume 1, pages 141‚Äì97. *To know there is a God *Not to believe in divinity besides God (20:3 in NJPS). *Not to make an idol for yourself (20:4 in NJPS). *Not to worship idols in the manner they are worshiped (20:5 in NJPS). *Not to worship idols in the four ways we worship God *Not to take God's Name in vain. *To sanctify the Sabbath with Kiddush and Havdalah (20:8 in NJPS). *Not to do prohibited labor on the Sabbath (20:10 in NJPS). *To respect your father and mother *Not to murder *Not to commit adultery *Not to kidnap *Not to testify falsely *Not to covet another's possession *Not to make human forms even for decorative purposes (20:20 in NJPS) *Not to build the altar with hewn stones *Not to climb steps to the altar. In the liturgy The second blessing before the Shema speaks of how God \\"loves His people Israel,\\" reflecting the statement of that Israel is God's people.Reuven Hammer, Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals (New York: The Rabbinical Assembly, 2003), page 29. The fire surrounding God's Presence in is reflected in , which is in turn one of the six Psalms recited at the beginning of the Kabbalat Shabbat prayer service.Reuven Hammer, Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals, page 17. Reuven Hammer noted that Mishnah Tamid 5:1Mishnah Tamid 5:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner. recorded what was in effect the first siddur, as a part of which priests daily recited the Ten Commandments.Reuven Hammer, Entering Jewish Prayer: A Guide to Personal Devotion and the Worship Service (New York: Schocken, 1995), 76‚Äì82. It is customary for listeners to stand while the reader chants the Ten Commandments in the synagogue, as if the listeners were themselves receiving the revelation at Sinai.W. Gunther Plaut. The Torah: A Modern Commentary: Revised Edition. Revised edition edited by David E.S. Stern, page 469. The Lekhah Dodi liturgical poem of the Kabbalat Shabbat service quotes both the commandment of (Exodus 20:8 in NJPS) to \\"remember\\" the Sabbath and the commandment of (Deuteronomy 5:12 in NJPS) to \\"keep\\" or \\"observe\\" the Sabbath, saying that they \\"were uttered as one by our Creator.\\"Reuven Hammer, Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals, page 21. And following the Kabbalat Shabbat service and prior to the Friday evening (Ma'ariv) service, Jews traditionally read rabbinic sources on the observance of the Sabbath, including Genesis Rabbah 11:9.Genesis Rabbah 11:9, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, page 86. Genesis Rabbah 11:9, in turn, interpreted the commandment of (20:8 in NJPS) to \\"remember\\" the Sabbath.Reuven Hammer, Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals, page 26. The Kiddusha Rabba blessing for the Sabbath day meal quotes (Exodus 20:8‚Äì11 in NJPS) immediately before the blessing on wine.Menachem Davis, editor, The Schottenstein Edition Siddur for the Sabbath and Festivals with an Interlinear Translation (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2002), pages 458‚Äì59. Among the zemirot or songs of praise for the Sabbath day meal, the song Baruch Kel Elyon, written by Rabbi Baruch ben Samuel, quotes (Exodus 20:8 in NJPS) and in concluding paraphrases (Exodus 20:10 in NJPS), saying \\"In all your dwellings, do not do work ‚Äî your sons and daughters, the servant and the maidservant.\\"Menachem Davis, editor, The Schottenstein Edition Siddur for the Sabbath and Festivals with an Interlinear Translation, page 466. Isaiah's Lips Anointed with Fire (1784 painting by Benjamin West) Similarly, among the zemirot for the Sabbath day meal, the song Yom Zeh Mechubad paraphrases (Exodus 20:9‚Äì11 in NJPS), saying, \\"This day is honored from among all days, for on it rested the One Who fashioned the universe. Six days you may do your work, but the Seventh Day belongs to your God. The Sabbath: Do not do on it any work, for everything God completed in six days.\\"Menachem Davis, editor, The Schottenstein Edition Siddur for the Sabbath and Festivals with an Interlinear Translation, pages 466‚Äì67. Many Jews study successive chapters of Pirkei Avot (Chapters of the Fathers) on Sabbaths between Passover and Rosh Hashanah. And Avot 3:6 quotes (20:21 in NJPS) for the proposition that even when only a single person sits occupied with Torah, the Shechinah is with the student.Menachem Davis, editor, The Schottenstein Edition Siddur for the Sabbath and Festivals with an Interlinear Translation, page 549. The Weekly Maqam In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews each week base the songs of the services on the content of that week's parashah. For Parashah Yitro, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Hoseni, the maqam that expresses beauty, which is especially appropriate in this parashah because it is the parashah where the Israelites receive the Ten Commandments.See Mark L. Kligman, \\"The Bible, Prayer, and Maqam: Extra-Musical Associations of Syrian Jews,\\" Ethnomusicology, volume 45 (number 3) (Autumn 2001): pages 443‚Äì479; Mark L.

Haftarah The haftarah for the parashah is and . =Connection to the Parashah= Both the parashah and the haftarah recount God's revelation. Both the parashah and the haftarah describe Divine Beings as winged. . Both the parashah and the haftarah report God's presence accompanied by shaking and smoke. . And both the parashah and the haftarah speak of making Israel a holy community. .

Taylor is quoted saying: ‚ÄúIt seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses. . . . And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me. . . . Why will you Jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity. . . . But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.‚Äù). *Maynard Owen Williams. \\"East of Suez to the Mount of the Decalogue: Following the Trail Over Which Moses Led the Israelites from the Slave-Pens of Egypt to Sinai.\\" National Geographic.

He was created by Alfred Bester and Stan Kaye. Johnny \\"Genius\\" Jones, a young boy, is stranded on a desert island with 734 books. Jones reads every book, memorizing every bit of information from them. He ultimately burns the books to attract the attention of a passing ship. Once back in civilization he sets himself up as the Answer Man, a costumed hero who answers questions and solves crimes for a dime. He has no superpowers but has a very advanced lab. He is also aided by an adult sidekick named Mr. Oldster. Publication history Genius Jones (created by science fiction writer Alfred Bester), debuted in Adventure Comics #77 (August, 1942) with \\"The Case of the Off-Key Crooner\\". He called himself the Answer Man, although in a twist that pre-dated the Elongated Man by nearly 20 years, he made no attempt to hide his secret identity. His costume of purple gray tights, red cape and boots, and yellow helmet was designed by Stan Kaye, who continued drawing the feature after Bester left. His first full cover appearance was on the cover of All Funny Comics #5 in the winter of 1944-45. Jones' stories usually have imaginative titles, like \\"Did You Ever See A Dream Walking?\\", \\"Way Down Yonder In the Corn Field\\", \\"Fish Are Such Liars\\", \\"The Enigma of the Nonagenarian Narrator\\", and Adventure #88's \\"The Death of Genius Jones\\". Alfred Bester's last Genius Jones tale (according to the Grand Comics Database) was Adventure Comics #92's \\"The Saving Scot and The Gypsy Gyp\\". Bester left to write science fiction novels, (such as The Demolished Man), and travel articles for the magazine Holiday. Genius Jones features continued in Adventure Comics until #102. Following issue #102, the More Fun superhero stable of Superboy, Green Arrow, Aquaman, and Johnny Quick moved to Adventure while Genius Jones, more a humor feature than a superhero one, moved to More Fun. Jones' More Fun adventures started with #108 where he shared the cover with Harry Boltinoff's twin detectives Dover and Clover. They alternated covers until the introduction of Howard Post's \\"Jimminy and the Magic Book\\" in #121. \\"Jimminy and the Magic Book\\" appeared on the covers during More Fun's final year. More Fun, which had been DC's oldest title, was cancelled in late 1947. Genius's adventures in More Fun had titles like \\"Genius Meets Genius\\", \\"The Tell-Tale Tornado\\" and \\"Battle of the Pretzel Benders\\", according to the Comic Values Annual 2001. The last one, \\"The Case of the Gravy Spots\\", appeared in More Fun #126. These and other tales were probably written by Whitney Ellsworth. In 1943, Jones also appeared in the newly-christened All-Funny Comics. He continued in All-Funny until #19. His weirdest titled tale \\"The Mystery of Etaoin Shrdlu!\\", in which he solved a mystery at a typing school, appeared in All-Funny #13. Genius Jones disappeared from the DC Universe in the next-to-last issue of More Fun Comics (#126) in late 1947. =One Year Later= Genius Jones recently resurfaced into the pages of Tales of the Unexpected in 2007, (collected in the TPB 'Architecture & Mortality'), first in dream sequences hinting at Doctor Thirteen's demise before the universe-altering effects of Infinite Crisis, then offering his services for his usual fee in a convoluted adventure involving other forgotten Golden and Silver Age characters: Anthro, I...Vampire, Infectious Lass, Captain Fear, Haunted Tank, and Count Julius from the Primate Patrol. He reveals that he is aware of the fourth wall, cryptically talking about the commercial wars between Marvel Comics and DC Comics, and how DC's editors, the Architects, had to reboot or modify their respective fictional worlds to increase sales. They confront the Architects directly and try to justify their continued existence. They seem to have succeeded, and are in fact pursuing Captain Fear, kidnapped by Black Manta, when Dr. Thirteen discovers an old DC comic from 1969. It makes him realize they are characters in a story. The story ends with the rest of the characters entering an elevator, as Dr. Thirteen begs the reader not to turn the page. Powers and abilities Genius Jones had no superpowers, but possessed a genius-level intellect and is a gifted inventor. References External links *Genius Jones at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

She wrote about her late-in-life realization of her father's role in that criminal empire. Berman became a longtime friend and confidant of billionaire Robert Durst, who was suspected of foul play in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathleen McCormack. Berman was found dead on Christmas Eve 2000 in her home in Benedict Canyon, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. Fifteen years later, on March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in New Orleans and charged with first-degree murder in connection with Berman's death. Early life Susan Berman was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1945, the only child of the former Betty Ewald, a traveling dancer who had adopted the stage name Gladys Evans, and Davie Berman. Berman always maintained that her father ‚Äî a mob figure who replaced Bugsy Siegel at Las Vegas' Flamingo Hotel after Siegel's gangland murder ‚Äî died under mysterious circumstances on an operating table when Berman was twelve, but all indications were that he died of a heart attack during surgery. She also believed uncertainty surrounded her mother's presumed suicide by overdose a year later. Berman grew up in Las Vegas and, later, in Hollywood, California, where high school classmates and friends at the Chadwick School on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles included Jann Wenner and Liza Minnelli. Berman received a bachelor of arts degree in 1967 from UCLA, where she met Robert Durst. In 1969, she graduated with a master of arts in journalism from the University of California, Berkeley. Berman was gradually paid a total of $4.3 million by the Mafia for her father's interests in casinos and other properties. Career Berman was a novelist and author of two memoirs, along with a 1971 college guidebook, The Underground Guide to the College of Your Choice. Her first memoir, Easy Street, detailed her life as a mobster's daughter. While representing her in the 1970s, the William Morris Agency talked with several Hollywood producers interested in adapting the book into a screenplay. The movie rights were ultimately sold for $350,000, but no film project ever got off the ground. For a time, Berman attempted to finance a musical based on the Dreyfus affair, in which Durst declined to invest. In San Francisco, Berman wrote for various media outlets, including the San Francisco Examiner, Francis Ford Coppola's City Magazine, the Westinghouse Evening Show on KPIX-TV, and the People show on CBS. Berman was a contributing writer for magazines such as New York, Cosmopolitan and Family Circle. She also wrote Driver, Give a Soldier a Lift! and Lady Las Vegas, accompanying the 1996 release of an A&E; documentary, for which she was a co-writer and nominated for a Writers Guild of America award. At the time of her death, she was working on a project for Showtime with attorney Kevin Norte. Entitled Sin City, it was being planned as Showtime's version of the HBO hit The Sopranos. Personal life Berman lived just off the Sunset Strip on Alta Loma Road in West Hollywood for several years prior to her final residence in Benedict Canyon, a suburb of Los Angeles. Her manager Nyle Brenner later told the Los Angeles Times that \\"many details of Ms. Berman's personal life are unclear\\" and added \\"she had been married once in the 1980s, and later helped rear the two children of a boyfriend.\\" She was married only once, to a Mr. Margulies, in June 1984 at the Hotel Bel-Air; Durst walked Berman down the aisle. Margulies died of a heroin overdose in 1986. She kept close ties to friends on Alta Loma Road, at the Las Vegas Strip and in New York City, including Durst. Murder Berman was found murdered execution style with a 9mm handgun on Christmas Eve 2000 in her rented Benedict Canyon home, and was presumed to have been dead at least a day. On March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on a first-degree murder warrant issued out of Los Angeles. Although Durst's presumed victim was not immediately named by authorities, the Times first reported that he had been detained in connection to Berman's slaying. Three days after his arrest, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey said that if convicted, Durst could face the death penalty in California for \\"special circumstances of murder of a witness and lying in wait.\\" Durst was transferred to and arraigned in California in early November 2016.Los Angeles Times Various published accounts, including Murder of a Mafia Daughter by author Cathy Scott, have reported possible connections between Berman's murder and the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Berman became a confidante of Durst, an heir to a New York real estate fortune, at UCLA in the late 1960s, and came to know Kathleen after later moving to New York.Book Probes New Evidence in Mob Daughter's Murder  Psychology Today In a review of Scott's book, True Crime Zine wrote that \\"detectives came to suspect one of [Berman's] long-time friends but have never been able to charge him with murder.\\"Susan Berman book: Murder in Beverly Hills by Cathy Scott  True Crime Zine Durst was also considered a prime suspect in his wife's disappearance, but was never charged in the case. Berman initially acted as a media spokesperson for Durst, and is believed to have facilitated his public alibi. She supplied a deposition in the case in 1982, which Durst faxed to investigators after her murder. Berman had remained Durst's friend and received two large cash gifts totaling $50,000 from him in the months before her death; Berman had last written to Durst on November 5, 2000, expressing hope that her financial entreaties would not ruin their friendship. Earlier in 2000, New York State Police, at the request of then-District Attorney Jeanine Pirro of Westchester County, had re-opened an investigation into Kathleen's disappearance, and was urged by her friends to contact Berman for an interview. Berman was killed weeks after the re-opened investigation was publicized. Durst's March 2015 arrest warrant mentioned a previously undisclosed typewritten letter, mailed from New York on January 9, 2001 to a West Los Angeles police station, titled, \\"Possible motive for Susan Berman murder.\\" The letter said Berman suspected Durst was involved in his wife's disappearance, and specified that Durst was planning to visit her in late December. Berman biographer Scott told the New York Post in February 2017, before witnesses were to testify against Durst in a pre-trial hearing, that the evidence points to his guilt in Berman's murder. Berman was interred at Home of Peace Memorial Park in East Los Angeles, California.

According to the Human Development Index (HDI), Egypt is ranked 115 in the HDI, and 9 in the lowest 10 HDI countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa, in 2014. With the help of the World Bank and other multilateral organizations Egypt aims to increase access in early childhood to care and education and the inclusion of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at all levels of education, especially at the tertiary level. The government is responsible for offering free education at all levels. The current overall expenditure on education is about 12.6 percent as of 2007. Investment in education as a percentage of GDP rose to 4.8 in 2005 but then fell to 3.7 in 2007. The Ministry of Education is also tackling a number of issues: trying to move from a highly centralized system to offering more autonomy to individual institutions, thereby increasing accountability. Education system The public education system in Egypt consists of three levels: the basic education stage for 4‚Äì14 years old: kindergarten for two years followed by primary school for six years and preparatory school (ISCED Level 2) for three years. Then, the secondary school (ISCED Level 3) stage is for three years, for ages 15 to 17, followed by the tertiary level. Education is made compulsory for 9 academic years between the ages of 4 and 14. Moreover, all levels of education are free within any government run schools. According to the World Bank, there are great differences in educational attainment of the rich and the poor, also known as the \\"wealth gap.\\" Although the median years of school completed by the rich and the poor is only one or two years but the wealth gap reaches as high as nine or ten years. In the case of Egypt, the wealth gap was a modest 3 years in the mid-1990s. The Lyc√©e Fran√ßais d'Alexandrie of Alexandria in 2001 Egypt launched its National Strategic Plan for Pre-University Education Reform (2007/08 ‚Äì 2011/12). The Strategic Plan (which has the subtitle ‚ÄòTowards an educational paradigm shift‚Äô) mirrors Egypt's commitment to a comprehensive, sustainable, and collective approach towards ensuring an education of quality for all and developing a knowledge society. Its key elements are: access and participation; teachers; pedagogy; curriculum and learning assessment; textbooks and learning materials; management and governance; and a quality improvement strategy. Promotional examinations are held at all levels except in grades 6 and 9 at the basic education level and the grade 12 in the secondary stage, which apply standardized regional or national exams. The Ministry of Education is responsible for making decisions about the education system with the support of three Centers: the National Center of Curricula Development, the National Center for Education Research, and the National Center for Examinations and Educational Evaluation. Each center has its own focus in formulating education policies with other state level committees. On the other hand, the Ministry of Higher Education supervises the higher education system. Relief of Horemheb's tomb - 18th dynasty of Egypt - Saqqara There is also a formal teacher's qualification track in place for basic and secondary education levels. The teachers are required to complete four years of pre-service courses at university to enter the teaching profession. Specifically with respect to teacher's professional development to raise mathematics, science and technology teaching standards, the Professional Academy for Teachers offer several programs. Local teachers also take part in the international professional training programs. Starting in 2007, the Ministries of Education, Finance, and Local Development (and others) started informal discussions to experiment with the decentralization of education. Working groups were established to make more formal proposals. Proposals included ideas for starting with recurrent expenditures, using a simple and transparent formula for carrying out fiscal transfers, and making sure that transfers would reach the school itself. Library at Bibufe During 2008 design was carried out, three pilot governorates (Faiyum, Ismailia, and Luxor) were chosen, and monitoring and capacity building processes and manuals were agreed upon. The formula is quite simple, and includes enrolment, poverty, and stage of education as drivers. During 2009 funding was decentralized all the way to the school level, and schools began to receive funding. As of late 2009, the pilot showed few if any problems, and the expected results were materializing quite well, in terms of stimulating community participation, allowing schools to spend more efficiently and assess their own priorities, and increasing the seriousness of school-based planning by creating a means to finance such plans, among other expected results. An informal assessment of the pilot revealed that the funding formula money precipitated an increase in community donations. The survey results show that the ratio of the median values of community donations of the pilot year to the previous year was 2.20. Parallel to these efforts in the education sector, other sectors (for example, certain aspects of housing and municipal services) in Egypt are planning to decentralize decision-making and spending, now nationwide (without a pilot stage in limited governorates), in a phased approach. Education plans to be one of the lead sectors in this process. In addition to administrative and financial decentralization, there is an increasing emphasis on involving elected local popular councils (which exist at governorate and district level) in the horizontal oversight of expenditure and planning across the decentralizing sectors, and as they come on stream in the decentralization process. Within the education sector, as of late 2009 plans are being made to decentralize certain lines of funding and planning for capital equipment and infrastructure, in all governorates, all the way to school level in the case of smaller units of capital equipment, or levels higher than the school for items such as new infrastructure. The education sector does expect to continue to use the original 3 pilot governorates as a special observatory to assess and understand how well the process is proceeding.  History of education in Egypt  Modern education was introduced under the auspices of Ottoman Pasha Muhammad Ali who reigned 1805-1848. He started a dual system of education at the time: one serving the message attending traditional schools (Mansourya) and another called Madrasa (Arabic word for school) for the elite civil servants. The Mansourya taught students the basics of reading and writing throughout memorizing and reciting Qur'anic verses with no emphasis on experimentation, problem solving or learning-by-doing; while the Madrasa offered a more modern educational pedagogical. Ali Pasha sent two organized student missions to study in Paris. French involvement in Egyptian education was not initially a government project, but rather evolved to become a government project by the end of the Pasha's rule. The first mission was a personal venture to keep the spirit of the 1798 Napoleonic expedition alive through informal cultural imperialism. The French government was involved in the second student mission of 1844. It was motivated by their colonial interests in North Africa.Archana Prakash, \\"Reappraising the French role in nineteenth-century Egyptian education.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 54.4 (2018): 537-554. Under British control, 1882‚Äì1920, educational opportunities were significantly reduced. The British ruler Lord Cromer had a negative experience in India, where advanced education led to Indian nationalism that was highly critical of the British Raj. In Egypt Cromer reduced the budget for education, closed many of the specialized postsecondary institutions, and refocused the curriculum on vocational topics. Tuition fees were imposed which reduce the availability for most Egyptians.Mona L. Russell, \\"Competing, overlapping, and contradictory agendas: Egyptian education under British occupation, 1882-1922.\\" Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 21.1 (2001): 50-60. Demographics UIS Literacy Rate Egypt population plus15 1980 2015 by UNESCO Institute of Statistics The overall literacy rate in Egypt is 72 percent as of 2010, being 80.3% for males and 63.5% for females. There is special attention given by the government and other NGOs to reduce gender disparity in education and to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education. The Egyptian educational system is highly centralized, and is divided into three stages: * Basic Education (, transliteration: al-Ta øaleem al-Asassƒ´) ** Primary Stage ** Preparatory Stage * Secondary Education (, transliteration: al-Ta øaleem al-Thanawƒ´) * Post- Secondary education (, transliteration: al-Ta øaleem al-Gamme øƒ´) Since Egypt's extension of the free compulsory education law in 1981 to include the Preparatory Stage, both Primary and Preparatory phases (Ages 6 through 14) have been combined together under the label Basic Education. Education beyond this stage depends on the student's ability. Many private schools offer additional educational programs, along with the national curriculum, such as the American High School Diploma, the British IGCSE system, the French baccalaur√©at, the German Abitur and the International Baccalaureate. These are the types of private schools in Egypt. Basic education The basic education consists of pre-primary, primary and preparatory levels of education (ISCED Level 0, 1, 2). In Egypt, the Ministry of Education coordinates the preschool education. In 1999-2000 the total enrollment rate of pre-primary students was 16 percent and that increased to 24 percent in 2009. Irrespective of private or state run, all preschool institutions come under Ministry of Education. It is the Ministry's duty to select and distribute textbooks. According to the Ministry's guidelines, the maximum size of a preschool should not exceed more than 45 students . Ministry of Education is also getting support from the international agencies, such as the World Bank to enhance the early childhood education system by increasing access to schools, improving quality of education and building capacity of teachers At the primary level (ISCED Level 1) students could attend private, religious or government schools. Currently, there are 7.8 percent of students enrolled at primary level in private schools as of 2007. The total enrollment of students at primary level is 105 percent in 2007. The examinations at grade 3 are on district (edara) level. Though there is a push for Egyptian children to attend primary school, educators are often ill-equipped to teach them. As of 1995, a mere 7 percent of primary school teachers in Egypt had received a university degree; the remaining 93 percent only had nine years of formal education. The second tier of basic compulsory education equivalent to (ISCED Level 2) is the 'preparatory stage' or 'lower secondary' which is three years long. Completion of this tier grants students the Basic Education Completion Certificate. The importance of completion of this level of education is to safeguard students against illiteracy as early drop outs at this stage easily recede into illiteracy and eventually poverty. Secondary education Secondary education consists of three tracks: general, vocational/technical and the dual-system vocational education known as Mubarak-Kohl schools. The general secondary stage includes 3 years of education, whereas the secondary vocational track could be for 3‚Äì5 years. To enter the secondary level, the students must pass a national exam which is given at end of the preparatory stage. As of year 2004 the 77.3 percent of students completing preparatory stage are estimated to be enrolled in secondary education. At this level, students have formative and summative assessments during the first year and the average of the end of year national standardized exams for year two and three qualifies the students to take the Certificate of General Secondary Education-Thanawiya Amma, which is one of the requirements for admission into the universities. So far efforts are underway with the support of multilateral organizations to make the general and vocational secondary system less rigid and provide equal opportunities to students of various wealth quintiles in the two tracks to opt for higher education. This is also being implemented by the World Bank led secondary enhancement project in Egypt. Secondary education consists of three different types: general, technical or vocational. Technical education, which is provided in three-year and five-year programs, includes schools in three different fields: industrial, commercial and agricultural. The UN and other multilateral organizations are working towards improving the technical and vocational training system in Egypt. It is recommended to the Ministry of Education to introduce broad vocational skills in the curricula of general secondary schools. In this way students will be able to gain certification in practical skills needed in the job market. The Ministry of Education (MoE) controls pre-tertiary, school-based programs that can start after grade 6 and that enroll the largest number of students in TVET-over 2 million students. The Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) controls the middle technical institutes (MTIs). These draw their enrollments from MoE's general secondary schools or technical schools and have much smaller enrollment numbers. Graduates of the MoE's vocational programs can enter vocational training centers (VTCs). From the 2004 data, it is estimated that 30 percent of the secondary students have opted for the vocational track. The Government of Egypt has undertaken some promising initiatives to strengthen the management and reform of the TVET system. In 2006 the Industrial Training Council (ITC) was created through a ministerial decree with a mandate to improve coordination and direction of all training related entities, projects and policies in the Ministry. Its action is framed by the global \\"Technical Education Strategy (2011/2012-2016/2017). The focus on technical education and training aims at resolving the issue faced by most firms to employ skilled work force: According to the Enterprise Surveys in 2007, 31 percent of the firms in Egypt identify labor skill level as the major constraint of doing business in the country.  Al-Azhar system  Another system that runs in parallel with the public educational system is known as the Al-Azhar system. It consists of six years of primary stage, a three-year preparatory stage and finally three years of secondary stage. The Ministry of education reduced the number of secondary school years from four to three years in 1998, so as to align the Al Azhar system with the general secondary education system. In this system as well, there are separate schools for girls and boys. Al Azhar education system is supervised by the Supreme Council of the Al-Azhar Institution. The Azhar Institution itself is nominally independent from the Ministry of Education, but is ultimately under supervision by the Egyptian Prime Minister. Al Azhar schools are named \\"Institutes\\" and include primary, preparatory, and secondary phases. All schools in all stages teach religious subjects and non-religious subjects. The bulk of the curriculum, however, consists of religious subjects as described below. All the students are Muslims. Al-Azhar schools are all over the country, especially in rural areas. The graduates of Al-Azhar secondary schools are eligible to continue their studies at the Al-Azhar University. As of 2007 and 2008, there are 8272 Al- Azhar schools in Egypt. In the early 2000s, Al-Azhar schools accounted for less than 4% of the total enrollment. The graduates of this system are then automatically accepted into Al-Azhar University.In 2007, the Pre-University enrollment in Al- Azhar institutes is about 1,906,290 students. Higher education system Egypt has a very extensive higher education system. About 30% of all Egyptians in the relevant age group go to university. However, only half of them graduate.The Economist, \\"Waking from its sleep - A special report on the Arab world\\", p. 14, July 25th 2009 The Ministry of Higher Education supervises the tertiary level of education. There are a number of universities catering to students in diverse fields. In the current education system, there are 17 public universities, 51 public non-university institutions, 16 private universities and 89 private higher institutions. Out of the 51 non ‚Äìuniversity institutions, 47 are two-year middle technical institutes (MTIs) and four are 4‚Äì5 years higher technical institutes‚Äô. The higher education cohort is expected to increase by close to 6 percent (60,000) students per annum through 2009. In 1990, a legislation was passed to provide greater autonomy to the universities. But still the education infrastructure, equipment and human resources are not in place to cater to the rising higher education students. Gross enrollment in tertiary education increased from 27 percent in 2003 to 31 percent in 2005. But there has not been a similar increase in spending on improving the higher education system in terms of introduction of new programs and technologies. Both at national level (inspection systems, examinations) and at local level (school level student assessments) measures of the success of education strategies and the performance of the system are weak. The inspectorate system does not provide either solid technical support to school staff, nor an effective monitoring mechanism for failing schools. The examination system at the end of preparatory and secondary levels‚ÄîThanaweyya Amma, does not measure higher-order thinking skills, but concentrates rather on rote memorization. Scores can thus be raised significantly by exam specific tutoring, therefore, students with more resources can afford private tutoring which helps them to score higher on the national standardized exams and hence are accepted in top universities in Egypt. Hence, this competitive process of selection restricts students' degree options and results, hence making students opt for programs and careers which are of little interest to them. The Egyptian tertiary education is steered by a centralized system with institutions having little control on the decisions of the curriculum, program development and deployment of staff and faculty. Improving system governance and efficiency is an imperative that takes on added urgency given that a significant population bulge has reached the higher education system. The actual number of students entering higher education grew by 18 percent per year between 1992/93 and 1997/98. The consequence was a sharp decline in per student spending of around 40 percent in real terms over that period. The higher education cohort is projected to continue to increase by close to 6 percent (60,000 students) per annum through 2009. This means that significant efficiencies will need to be introduced into the system just to maintain quality at its current inadequate level. The performance and quality of higher education is currently severely compromised by overly centralized order to improve the already outdated system, rigid curriculum and teaching practices.

This means that significant efficiencies will need to be introduced into the system just to maintain quality at its current inadequate level. The Government of Egypt recognizes that there are real challenges to be faced in the sector, foremost amongst which are the need to significantly improve sector governance and efficiency, increase institutional autonomy, significantly improve the quality and relevance of higher education programs, and maintain coverage at existing levels. Recent Government actions to build political consensus on issues critical to reform have created a climate that is ripe for change. The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) acts as a champion for reform. The Minister, appointed in 1997, quickly established a committee for the reform of higher education (known as the HEEP Committee) which drew in a wide range of stakeholders including industrialists and parliamentarians. A National Conference on higher education reform was held in February 2000, and a Declaration for action emanating from the Conference was endorsed by the President and the Prime Minister. The Declaration identified 25 specific reform initiatives. The Bank agrees with, and supports, the Declaration. A range of multilateral and bilateral agencies, including the World Bank, also concur with the Declaration's proposals, and are committed to supporting various aspects of the reform process. The Government's Higher Education Reform Strategy Egyptian higher education reform strategy included 25 projects addressing all the reform domains, is implemented over three phases until 2017, and corresponds to the government's five-year plans as follows: First phase from 2002 to 2007 Second phase from 2007 to 2012 Third phase from 2012 to 2017 Priority has been given to 12 projects in the first phase of implementation (2002‚Äì2007) and were integrated into the following six projects: HEEP Six Priority Projects (2002‚Äì2007) Higher Education Enhancement Project Fund (HEEPF), Information and Communications Technology Project (ICTP), Egyptian Technical Colleges Project (ETCP), Faculty of Education Project (FOEP), Faculty Leaders Development Project (FLDP), Quality Assurance and Accreditation Project (QAAP). In August 2004, HEEP strategic priorities were adjusted to become responsive to the requirements of quality and accreditation and to correspond to the government's approach to improving scientific research. The adjustment added two more dimensions: first, developing post graduate studies and scientific research and second, addressing students‚Äô extra-curricular activities in addition to the continued implementation of the six prioritized programs during the first phase. Due to the dynamic nature of the reform strategy, which entails reconsidering priorities for each period, a Strategic Planning Unit (SPU) was established for the MOHE to ensure the sustainability of planning and project monitoring during the three phases and for future ones. A Students‚Äô Activity Project (SAP) was also initiated as part of program accreditation similar to scientific research and post graduate studies. There are both private and public institutions of higher education in Egypt. Public higher education is free in Egypt, and Egyptian students only pay registration fees. Private education is much more expensive. In 2019, the unemployment rate of university graduates in Egypt reached 36.1%, according to CAPMAS. The agency added that 25.1% of this rate was males, while the females formed 53.2%.  International education  As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Egypt as having 184 international schools. ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \\"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country's national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist.  Agricultural education  The Egyptian Ministry of Education (MoE) aiming to develop agricultural knowledge and skills among young people set up by 2010/2011 133 secondary agricultural schools 133 in different cities and districts. Agricultural education is divided into a three-year and a five-year system. Both 3 year and 5 year options provide theoretical information taught in the classroom and practical aspects taught in laboratories, workshops and farms. These schools coordinate with the Ministry of Agriculture to provide training opportunities for teaching staff about technical farming issues at agricultural research centres. Farming plots are provided to schools and to offer job opportunities to graduates at institutions affiliated to the Ministry of Agriculture.  Challenges  Although significant progress has been made to increase human capital base through improved education system, still the quality of education experience is low and unequally distributed. Due to lack of good quality education at the basic and secondary levels, there has been a mushrooming market for private tutoring. Now to take private tuition has become more of an obligation than a remedial activity. According to the Egypt Human Development Report (2005), 58 percent of surveyed families stated that their children take private tutoring. The CAPMAS (2004) survey showed that households spend on average around 61 percent of total education expenditure on private tutoring. In addition, per household expenditure of the richest quintile on private tutoring is more than seven times that of the poorest. Among the issues is the lack of sufficient education in public schools and the need for private tuition. As of 2005, 61-70% of Egyptian students attend private tuition. Other common issues include: theft of public educational funds and leakage of exams. Egypt also has a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled workforce. But there has been an abundance of low-skilled laborers. Even if there are any high-skilled workers available, their quality of training is quite poor. This is mostly a problem in small-medium companies and large public industries that work in \\"protected\\" domestic markets. The average gross production per worker is lower than other North African countries: Morocco and Tunisia. Youth unemployment is also very high, primarily due to lack of education system in providing necessary training under TVET programs. Egyptian education faces a main challenge because of the quality of teachers that teach in public schools. An ethnography study conducted by Sarah Hartmann in 2008 concluded that most teachers in Egypt resort to teaching for lack of better options and because the nature of the job does not conflict with their more important gender role as mothers. The low salaries offered by the public schooling system in Egypt attracts low- skilled employees. A study conducted in 1989 documenting the bureaucracy of the Egyptian Ministry of Education concluded that teachers' annual salary in Egypt is, on average, $360. A later study conducted in 2011 showed that teachers earn an average annual salary of $460 which is less than half the country's average annual per-capita income. Following the low quality of teachers in Egypt, they lack basic psychological background that would allow them to deal with students. Corporal punishment is a common practice in Egyptian schools even though it has not been deeply discussed in literature. An example was brought to the media's attention in 2011 when a pre-K teacher was caught on video consistently beating his students harshly. A study conducted by UNESCO on educational equity in world's 16 most populous countries placed Egypt in the middle range in terms of equity of primary and secondary enrollments across governorates in Egypt. But when the wealth component is added to education attainment, the results are not very encouraging. There are significantly higher enrollment rates in wealthier regions at both the primary and secondary levels. This confirms that more efforts are needed to reduce the wealth gap in educational attainment  Holidays  Academic weekly holidays are on Fridays and sometimes, in addition to, either Thursdays or Saturdays. In addition to some of the state official holidays, religious or secular, there are two main vacations. The school summer vacation starts at the beginning or middle of June and ends around the middle of September. Winter vacation starts from the middle of January and goes to the beginning of February.

Kurdish prolonged warfare with the Iraqi Government armed forces in their struggle for self-rule northern Iraq (Southern Kurdistan) Najmadin Shukur Rauf Zanganeh, known as Mama Risha, is a well-known name among Kurds and Iraqis, for his courage and fearlessness, who became a heroic and courageous Peshmerga and fought for the freedom of Kurdistan, and for that he sacrificed his life and war for this freedom and soul. Made it a name that would be famous. Born in the village of Talaban near Kirkuk into a poor family. He was shamal‚Äôs brother the chamchamal most known gentlemen.Since there were no schools in their village he never went to school. He was soon recognised for his qualities as a guerrilla fighter as well as his personal qualities like bravery, courage, sincerity and fairness. He became the commander of Karti 4 Jabari in 1982, under his command Karti 4 became one of the most effective forces of PUK. His mental strength as well as his strength, stamina and his speed gave him a near mythical status in Kurdish society who were suffering oppression under Saddam Hussein rule. According to some Kurdish sources he chose that nickname because he swore that he would never shave his beard until Kurdistan was totally free from Ba'ath Party's control. He was also nicknamed the \\"Iron Man\\" for his furious and well organized battles and ambushes against the Iraqi forces near the Kirkuk area. In late 1970s, he joined the Peshmerga forces of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led by Jalal Talabani. He is considered by most Kurds as a role model and a legendary fighter. Najmadin was killed on January 25, 1985 in an ambush set by Tahsin Shaways in cooperation with the Iraqi intelligence agency (ÿ¨Ÿáÿßÿ≤ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ™).

At times, as during the Phanariote era, this presence has amounted to hegemony; at other times (including the present), the Greeks have simply been one among the many ethnic minorities in Romania. History =Ancient and medieval periods= The Greek presence in what is now Romania dates back as far as the apoikiai (colonies) and emporia (trade stations) founded in and around Dobruja (see Colonies in antiquity and Pontic Greeks), beginning in the 7th century BC. Starting with the Milesian colony at Istros, the process reached its height after Tomis was founded in the 5th century BC. Although forever subject to the Dacian interference and easily disrupted by changes in the politics of neighbour tribal chieftains, the colonies prospered until being briefly submitted in various forms by King Burebista (late 1st century BC). Immediately after, and for the following centuries, they were stripped of their privileges by their new Roman masters, and followed the Empire into its crises. In the Middle Ages, the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire was a living presence north of the Danube, maintaining a cultural hegemony over the lands virtually until its disappearance, and for long periods exercised actual political dominance in the area of modern Dobruja (known to the Byzantines as Scythia Minor). =Early modern period= After the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman Empire, the Hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia (the Danubian Principalities) often took on the patronage of many Greek-proper cultural institutions such as several monasteries on Mount Athos, gestures guaranteed to provide prestige within Eastern Orthodox culture. To this was added the exodus of Byzantine officials and commoners to the two countries, which were at the time under a rather relaxed Ottoman tutelage. They took opportunities to advance in office, and from early on included themselves in the inner circle of power. This meant not only the reliance of Princes on a new elite (more often than not, also one to provide it with the funds needed by the administrative effort), but also the gradual ascendancy of Greeks to the thrones themselves. The rapid change brought them much hostility from traditional boyars. Landowners in a rudimentary economy, accustomed to have an important say in political developments, these found themselves stripped of importance in the new structure, and became bitterly hostile to the immigrants. However, this was not the only notable trend: there were numerous cases of intermarriage at the top of the social scale (and not only), the arguably most famous of which being the ones inside the very powerful Cantacuzino family. =The Phanariote period= Philik√≠ Etaire√≠a and Ottomans in Bucharest, late 1821. With the early 18th century emergence of Phanariote rule over the Danubian Principalities, Greek culture became a norm. On one hand, this meant a noted neglect for the institutions inside the countries; on the other, the channeling of Princes' energies into emancipation from Ottoman rule, through projects that aimed for the erasing of inner borders of the Empire, moving toward the creation of an all-Balkan, neo-Byzantine state (seen as the extended identity of Greekdom). To these was added the omnipresence and omnipotence of Greek ethnic clerics at all levels of the religious hierarchy, with many monasteries becoming directly submitted to similar institutions in Greece, after being gradually granted by successive Princes. Thus, the emergence of Greek nationalism opened the two lands to revolution, as the main concentrations of political power available to it at the time, and the ones sharing a border with the expected supporter of the cause - Imperial Russia. The Wallachian stage of the Greek War of Independence consumed itself in a conflict between the initially supportive Anti-Ottoman Revolt led by Tudor Vladimirescu and the Philik√≠ Etaire√≠a, while Moldavia was under Greek occupation for a limited duration. The outcome only served to stir up animosity, and the Ottomans were receptive to the demands, putting an end to the Phanariote system in 1822. Jewish client in Bucharest, ca. 1880 =19th and 20th centuries= In time, most Greeks lost their specificity and became fully integrated (for example, a sizable portion of noble families considered \\"Phanariote\\" contributed to the adopted culture more than local ones). With new trends of migration, Romania became a less important target for exiled Greeks, and this became limited to people of lower social status--with ethnic Greeks being most visible as entrepreneurs, middlemen traders, and especially sailors (both on the Danube the Black Sea--in the case of the latter, after the integration of Dobruja in 1878, which also gave Romania a new population of Greeks, already on the spot). The communities were largely prosperous and maintained specific cultural institutions; they attracted a new wave of arrivals when Greece was hit by the Civil War, in the late 1940s. This situation was challenged by Communist Romania, with the properties of most organizations and many individuals being confiscated, and hundreds of Greek ethnics being imprisoned on sites such as the Danube-Black Sea Canal. Present situation Eastern Orthodox Church Metamorphosis in Constan»õa, with service occasionally held in Greek Among the towns and communes in Romania with the highest proportions of Greeks as of 2011 are Izvoarele (; 43.82%) and Sulina (; 1.69%), both in Tulcea County. According to the Romanian census of 2002, the Greek community numbered 6,472 persons, most of whom live in Bucharest and its surrounding area. Next in line come the Dobruja counties of Tulcea and Constan»õa, and the Danube-facing ones of BrƒÉila and Gala»õi. The 1992 census however found 19,594 Greeks;Greeks in Romania , eurominority.org.

It took place over the nights of 12 December and 15 December 1940. In 1940 Sheffield was a city of about 560,000 people and contained many heavy industries, primarily centred on steel and armaments. Hadfields steelworks was also the only place in the UK at that time where 18-inch armour-piercing shells were made. Most of the factories were located in the East End of the city beside the River Don. Documents captured at the end of the war showed that the targets for the raids included the Atlas Steelworks, Brown Bayley Steelworks, Meadowhall Iron Works, River Don Works, Darnall Wagon Works, Tinsley Park Collieries, East Hecla Works and Orgreave Coke Ovens.License, Paul (2000) Sheffield Blitz - In words, pictures and memories, Sheffield Newspapers Ltd.

The German code name for the operation was Schmelztiegel (\\"Crucible\\"). 12 December raid On the afternoon of Thursday 12 December British monitoring stations detected X Verfahren (sometimes called X-Ger√§t) radio beams being laid across northern England and calculated that the likely target of the coming raid would be Sheffield. Patchwork on the Wicker Arches covering an unexploded bomb hole The yellow alert was received at 6:15pm followed by the purple alert at 6:45pm. The red alert was sounded at 7pm. The attack was made by three main groups of aircraft flying from airfields in northern France, including Cambrai. 13 Heinkel 111s from Kampfgruppe 100, the German Pathfinder unit arrived over the city at 7:41pm and dropped 16 SC50 high- explosive bombs, 1,009 B1 E1 ZA incendiaries and 10,080 B1 E1 incendiaries. The first incendiaries were dropped over the suburbs of Norton Lees and Gleadless. The first main group was made up of three waves of 36 Junkers 88s and 29 Heinkel 111s. The second group was made up of 23 Junkers 88s, 74 Heinkel 111s and 7 Dornier 17s. The last group was made up of 63 Junkers 88s and 35 Heinkel 111s, a total of 280 aircraft.Wakefield, K. (1981) The First Pathfinders - The Operational History of Kampfgruppe 100, 1939-1941 At about 9:30pm a stick of bombs fell on Campo Lane and Vicar Lane, demolishing the West end of the Cathedral. At about 10:50pm a 500 kg bomb fell on and destroyed the C&A; and Burtons buildings opposite the Marples Hotel in Fitzalan Square.BBC.co.uk Sheffield Blitz At 11:44pm, The Marples Hotel itself received a direct hit. It is not known exactly how many people were killed but approximately 70 bodies were recovered from the rubble. This was the single biggest loss of life in the attacks. The majority of the bombs on this night fell on the City Centre or on residential districts with the last bombs falling at 4am. 15 December raid Sunday, the second night of the Blitz saw the first use of a new German policy for their pathfinders. High-explosive bombs were no longer carried and were replaced by incendiaries. On this night the pathfinder force was made up of 16 Heinkel 111s that dropped 11,520 B1 E1 incendiaries between 7pm and 7:50pm. The 15 large fires and the numerous small fires started were visible from 150 km away. The main raid was carried out by 50 Heinkel 111s and 11 Dornier 17s. The raid finished at 10:15pm. Many steelworks received hits, including Hadfields, Brown Bayleys and Steel, Peech and Tozer Ltd, although the damage was not serious enough to affect production. Aftermath In total over 660 people were killed, 1,500 injured and 40,000 made homeless. 3,000 homes were demolished with a further 3,000 badly damaged. A total of 78,000 homes received damage. Six George Medals were awarded to citizens of Sheffield for their bravery during the raids. 134 victims of the raids were buried in a communal grave in City Road Cemetery. Shrapnel damage left on the pillars of the Sheffield City Hall King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the city soon after the raids to inspect the damage and boost morale amongst survivors.

Bordered to the north by the River Crouch, and semi-isolated from the nearby towns of Hockley and Rayleigh, Hullbridge has a population of around 7,300 (2009), measured at 6,527 at the Census 2011. Prehistoric relics, such as Mesolithic flint axes, have been found in the parish.

Folklore has it that a Roman Bridge existed here but there is no documented evidence to support a Roman bridge. Essex Record Office however has records relating to a bridge, and to its upkeep and indeed an accident on or from the bridge. Maps of Essex from 16th Century onwards until the mid 18th Century do show the bridge. Benton's book discusses a document that discloses the existence in the reign of Elizabeth I of a bridge here. The OED defines \\"wholve\\" as a \\"short arched or covered drain under a path.\\" The word appears to be local to this part of Essex. This definition may cast doubt on it being the old name for the Crouch but may suggest this is the form of the bridge Along the river bank there are remains of evaporation pans where salt was made in Bronze Age times.http://hullbridgevillage.com/Historyvill.html> As captured by well renowned Countryside historian Oliver Rackham in his publication \\"History of Countryside\\" The field structures in and around Hullbridge and South Woodham Ferrers were formed during the Iron Age so an ancient settlement in or around Hullbridge is highly likely especially given the Saxon Burial ground finds in Rawreth when the Park school was being built. Before the coming of the railways to Rayleigh, Hullbridge's wharf's were important for the distribution of various commodities especially, coal and shale. It was from here that Rayleigh received such goods. One of the wharfs was later to be used for a Brickworks. The current village of Hullbridge was until around 1929 two communities in the parish of Hockley. One named Hullbridge, the other High Elms. In 1929 the owners of High Elms farm sold most of the land for development, so like its neighbour across the river South Woodham Ferrers it became a \\"Plotland\\" ripe for holiday homes. So began the growth of the village The village includes Riverside Primary School (opened September 2010, following the amalgamation of the infant and junior schools), a post office, a library and two pubs, The Anchor http://www.theanchorhullbridge.co.uk/ and The Smugglers Den (members only). Both overlook the river and have external drinking facilities. It also has three shopping facilities, One Stop, and two iterations of the The Co-operative Food (one being operated by Chelmsford Star Co-operative Society), a Chinese and fish and chip takeaway service and an Indian restaurant. A frequent bus service to Southend via Rayleigh, gives a rail link with London and Southend. Sport and leisure Hullbridge has a Non-League football club Hullbridge Sports F.C. who play at Lower Road. Leisure facilities include yacht clubs, a sports and social club, and the Hullbridge Community Centre.

Featuring Kerry Livgren, the group is a reformation of a band formed in the early 1970s which served as the direct precursor to Kansas. History In the early 1970s, the band Kansas went through three incarnations, the common member in all three being composer, keyboardist and guitarist Kerry Livgren. The sound of the band changed along with the group members. Proto-Kaw is a modern name given to the second version of Kansas, whose arrangements prominently featured guitar, keyboards, and saxophone (an instrument not found in the following line-up.) The famous Kansas was actually the third edition of the band, and before a name change it was the third incarnation of Topeka band White Clover. Formed in 1971 and disbanding in 1973, \\"Kansas II\\" played mostly original material written by Livgren. After Kansas II broke up, the group went their separate ways with Livgren reaching fame with the more-popular Kansas and the others assuming normal lives. Then in 2002, the band's demos saw release as Early Recordings from Kansas 1971-1973, which gave the band the new moniker Proto- Kaw. The name was derived from the words Proto (\\"original\\"), and Kaw (the root of the word Kansas, referring to a Native American tribe). Most members had not had any contact with each other for the intervening 30 years and many did not play music during this time. However, when they came together to celebrate the album's release, they rediscovered their old chemistry. Proto-Kaw reformed and at last got to record its first proper album, \\"Before Became After\\" (2004). The band released its second new CD in February, 2006, titled The Wait of Glory which features 12 new original songs from writer Kerry Livgren. Coinciding with the album release the band embarked on a European tour, bringing it to four countries in seven days. Disbanded In May 2007, the band reported it had begun studio work on its next effort, a collection of new tracks coupled with several previously recorded Livgren tracks interpreted by Proto-Kaw. However, in early December 2008 Kerry Livgren confirmed that Proto Kaw was no longer together for a variety of external reasons. Several tracks of the pending album were worked on, but plans to include them on a Proto-Kaw album were scuttled. Livgren thought that they may appear within a solo work of Livgren's at some future, undetermined date. Reunited again Following Kerry Livgren's massive stroke, and partial recovery, he announced in late 2010 that Proto-Kaw was back together and at work on a new album, slated for January 2011 release. The new album entitled Forth was released on Livgren's Numavox website in August 2011 and a CD release party was held in Kansas City.

He played number eight and lock for Bourgoin (1998‚Äì2004), Sale Sharks (2004‚Äì2009), Racing M√©tro 92 Paris (2009 ‚Äì February 2012), and for the French national team. Chabal played professionally for 16 years and won the English Premiership with Sale, and the 2007 Six Nations Championship with France. He also finished in fourth place at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He earned his first international cap on 4 March 2000 against Scotland, and represented France in 62 games. He is known for his full beard, long hair and ferocious tackling, leading the French rugby fans to nickname him l'Homme des Cavernes (Caveman). With this look, he has a number of lucrative commercial contracts. He was one of the most popular sportsmen in France, so much that local journalists wrote about Chabalmania. Personal life Born on 8 December 1977 in Valence, Dr√¥me, Chabal grew up in Beaumont-l√®s-Valence in the Dr√¥me department in southeast France. His modest family was originally from Ard√®che. His father worked in a garage and his mother worked in a jewellery store. Passionate about mechanical works, he attended a Lyc√©e professionnel where he studied for and obtained a brevet d'√©tudes professionnelles in mechanics. He then worked as a milling machine operator in a Salmson factory in Crest. While working in Crest, he played rugby for the amateur club in Beauvallon. When he joined Valence Sportif, he left his factory job and became a professional rugby union player. While playing for Bourgoin-Jallieu, he married Annick and became stepfather to her daughter who was born in 1994. In 2005, he welcomed the birth of his daughter Lily-Rose. Chabal is a member of the 'Champions for Peace' club, a group of 54 famous athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Monaco-based international organization Peace and Sport. In 2019, S√©bastien Chabal studied at EM Lyon Business School.  Playing career  = Early years = Chabal first tried rugby at the age of nine, but gave it up after just two months. However, he again tried his hand at rugby when he was sixteen, by following two friends who played for the local club in Beauvallon. This time, he discovered a passion for the game, and the camaraderie that follows matches. He quickly made his way up, through the French league system. First with Valence Sportif who played in the F√©d√©rale 2, the fourth division of French rugby, and then with CS Bourgoin-Jallieu in 1998 who played in the top flight. Here, he played as a flanker as his preferred position of number eight was taken by Pierre Raschi. With Bourgoin-Jallieu, Chabal played at the highest level of French domestic rugby, European club rugby and from here gained his first international cap for France. Moreover, at Bourgoin-Jallieu he played with the golden generation of players from the club's youth system such as Lionel Nallet, Julien Bonnaire, Olivier Milloud, Pascal Pap√©, and Benjamin Boyet. However, he did not win any trophies during this time although he played in the semi-final of the French Championship during the 2003‚Äì2004 season. He also played on the losing side in the 1998‚Äì99 European Challenge Cup final, the final of the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1999, the final of the League Cup in 2003 and the final of the Challenge Sud- Radio in 2003. On 11 October 2002, during the group stages of the 2002‚Äì2003 Heineken Cup, Bourgoin, with Chabal, defeated Sale Sharks 18‚Äì24 at Edgeley Park, the home of Sale Sharks. During this match, Jason Robinson received a yellow card for the first time in his career following a tackle from Chabal. In the return match, Bourgoin again defeated Sale, but finished second in their group to Biarritz Olympique as they had scored fewer tries. During the 2003‚Äì2004 Heineken Cup, Chabal and Bourgoin played against Munster and Gloucester in the group stage. On 6 December 2003, Bourgoin lost their first match at home against the Irish province 17‚Äì18. Chabal scored the only try of the encounter, but Ronan O'Gara scored six penalty kicks. One week later, Bougoin suffered a heavy defeat away at the hands of Gloucester 49‚Äì13, with Chabal again scoring the only try for his team. Bourgoin lost against Gloucester at home, and lost five of six matches during their 2003‚Äì2004 European campaign, finishing third in their pool and were eliminated from the competition. On 25 January 2004, the head coach of Bourgoin, Philippe Saint- Andr√©, was sacked after he applied for the position of head coach of the Welsh national team, left vacant following the departure of Steve Hansen. The ambitious plan for Bourgoin initiated by Laurent Seigne under the direction of Pierre Martinet and Patrick S√©bastien had ended. = English experience = Sebastien Chabal on for Racing Metro 92, 2009. Following the departure of Saint-Andr√©, and after six years wearing the blue jersey of Bourgoin, Chabal wanted to change his horizons and continue his professional development as a player at another club. He wished to join Stade Toulousain, but the club of the Ville Rose made no offer for his services. However, Saint-Andr√©, now sporting director at Sale Sharks, signed him on a two-year contract with the Manchester outfit. Although Chabal had played at flanker throughout his time at Bourgoin, Saint-Andr√© selected him at number eight in his first match for Sale. The 2004‚Äì2005 English Premiership marked the return of Sale Sharks to the country's top flight under the guidance of Saint-Andr√©. In their first two matches of the season, Sale, with Chabal, won against both Leicester Tigers and London Wasps, the favourites for the title that year.These two clubs finished first and second that at the end of the regular season and met in the final where Wasps beat Leicester 34‚Äì19 to win the title. The English club won the 2004‚Äì05 European Challenge Cup beating Pau 27‚Äì3 in the final. This was the first title won by Chabal. The Sharks lost their 2004‚Äì05 domestic league semi- final 43‚Äì22 against the eventual victors London Wasps, despite a try from Chabal, but finished the season in third place, securing their place in the 2005‚Äì06 Heineken Cup. By the end of the season, Chabal had made the position of Sharks No. 8 position his own. Chabal's second season with the English outfit brought more success. First, Sale reached the quarter-finals of the 2005‚Äì2006 Heineken Cup losing to Biarritz Olympique. Earlier in the group stages, Chabal was the victim of a gang tackle by Paul O'Connell and Anthony Foley during Sale's group-deciding match against Munster at Thomond Park. Chabal had only just caught a Ronan O'Gara restart when he was hit hard and driven back into his teams 22. The tackle was to turn the match in Munster's favour and established something of a stigma for Chabal against the Irish province (as he would be hit hard a number times by Munster centre Lifeimi Mafi in a match during the 2008‚Äì2009 season again with a crowd-pleasing outcome). Nevertheless, back in the English league, Sale won the 2005‚Äì06 Guinness Premiership by beating London Wasps 22‚Äì12 in the semi-final before defeating Leicester Tigers 45‚Äì20 in the final. With his two-year contract now up, Chabal turned down an offer to join Stade Toulousain and extended his contract with the Sharks for a further year. The 2006‚Äì2007 season was not as successful as 2005‚Äì2006. Sale finished sixth in the Guinness Premiership and were eliminated in the group stages of the Heineken Cup. However, during the group stages of the Heineken Cup, Sale played against Stade Fran√ßais and during the match in Paris, Chabal scored an interception try from Agust√≠n Pichot, running 50 metres to the line. Following this performance, Chabal was selected for the French national side for the 2007 Six Nations Championship. The 2007‚Äì2008 season was met with more success than the 2006‚Äì07, with victories against some of the best teams in the domestic championship, but a home defeat to London Irish on the last day of the regular season confined Sale to finishing the season in fifth place. However, this guaranteed them a place in the 2008‚Äì09 Heineken Cup having played in the 2007‚Äì08 European Challenge Cup. During the quarter-final of the European Challenge Cup against CA Brive, Chabal scored the first of six tries for the English side, but injured his knee. This injury forced him out of action for one month, during which Sale lost 36‚Äì14 to Bath Rugby in the semi-finals. In December 2007, Chabal extended his contract with Sale for a further two years. For the 2008‚Äì2009 season, Saint-Andr√© started playing Chabal in the second row instead of his more usual position of No. 8 or flanker. During the group stages of the Heineken Cup, Sale were grouped with Munster and Clermont, losing against both and depriving Sale and Chabal from the final phases of the competition. In the domestic competition, Sale were on course for a place in the playoffs, but not for a European competition place. However, in the penultimate game of the regular season, Chabal scored an important try that gave Sale an important bonus point and a place in the European competition. Despite this, during the last day of the regular season, although Sale won their match, results elsewhere led to Sale missing out on the play-offs and terminating the season for Chabal. Philippe Saint-Andr√© had announced in December 2008 that he was to leave Sale Sharks at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season with Kingsley Jones named as his successor. Chabal had already announced that he wished to return to play in France, his family had already left England in September 2008. = Return to France = After five years at Sale, Chabal officially signed a three-year contract with the French club Racing M√©tro 92 in April 2009. The French club were recently promoted to the Top 14 in 2009 after winning the 2008‚Äì2009 Pro D2 with three rounds to spare. They also signed Lionel Nallet and the South African's Fran√ßois Steyn and Jacques Cronj√©. Racing enjoyed success in their return to the top flight, claiming the sixth and final slot in the newly expanded Top 14 playoffs, where they narrowly lost in the first round at eventual champions Clermont. Racing's sixth-place finish also gave them a berth in the 2010‚Äì11 Heineken Cup. In September 2010, it was reported that Chabal is the highest-paid rugby player in the world, earning a reported ‚Ç¨1 million per year. Shane Richardson, Chief Executive of the South Sydney Rabbitohs, an Australian rugby league club revealed the club had contacted Chabal's management to inquire about the possibility to switch codes, where he would play \\"a portion of his season with the club.\\" The club were unsuccessful in their attempts to pursue Chabal. During the 2012‚Äì2013 and 2013‚Äì2014 seasons Chabal played for Lyon. He finished his playing career on a high in May 2014 by helping Lyon being promoted to the top division.The Guardian article: Chabal retirement International career Although Chabal is primarily a back-row player, former France coach Bernard Laporte frequently used him as a lock. In a 2007 interview, Chabal said that Laporte called him just before the France squad was announced for the 2007 Rugby World Cup and told him, \\"I really want to pick you but to play second row.\\" Chabal accepted Laporte's offer. At France's loss to England in the semi-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Chabal was visibly distraught, as they failed to make it to the final. Chabal was not included in Les Bleus squad for the 2008 Six Nations Championship. He expressed a desire to continue to represent his country, and believed that omission from the June tour to Australia would indicate that he was out of reckoning for France's 2011 World Cup preparations. On 9 June 2008 he was recalled to the France squad for their Australian tour. He was selected in the French squad for the 2008 Autumn internationals. He was called once again for the 2009 Six Nations Championship. In May 2011 Chabal was left out of France's provisional 32-man squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Other appearances In February 2012, Chabal made an appearance with Balmain Rugby Union from Sydney for one game against Petersham Rugby Club at ANZ Stadium. The game featured as a curtain raiser to the Round 1 Super Rugby game between the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds. Chabal's appearance created a media hype in both Australia and France. In the game, Chabal scored the last try for Balmain, winning 19‚Äì5.http://www.foxsports.com.au/rugby/super-rugby/the- caveman-sebastien-chabal-up-for-grabs-after-confirming-move-to-australia-to- play-super-rugby/story-e6frf4qu-1226271200264 Retrieved 27 February 2012 Fox Sports Australia Rugby In January 2014, Chabal appeared in an advertising campaign for an online currency exchange company CurrencyFair as the \\"Currency Fairy\\".http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1918602-sebastian-chabal-stars-in- bizarre-advert-as-the-currency-fairy He is a member of the 'Champions for Peace' club, a group of more than 90 famous elite created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization placed under the High Patronage of H.S.H Prince Albert II.

He then enrolled in acting classes at New York University School of Education where his classmate was the young Louis Gossett, Jr. Career He trained at the Neighborhood Playhouse, and worked off-Broadway as an actor and writer in the early 1960s. He appeared on Broadway in James Baldwin's Blues for Mister Charlie, with such notables as Diana Sands, and Al Freeman, Jr. His first movie appearance was in Murder in Mississippi (1965). In 1983 Young earned his bachelor's degree from L. I. F. E. Bible College in Los Angeles and became an ordained pastor, eventually serving as senior pastor of Elim Foursquare Gospel Church in Rochester, New York, from 1986‚Äì1988. He taught acting classes at School Without Walls, a college-like alternative public high school in Rochester, from 1987 through 1991. In 1989 he joined the faculty at Monroe Community College in Rochester; he remained there as a Professor of Communications and head of the Drama Department until his retirement in 1999. Death Young suffered a stroke in Los Angeles and died on October 12, 2001. He was buried by his (second) wife, Barbara, and his children, Saudia Young, Lovelady Young, El Mahdi Young, and Jemal Young. His memorial service was held at Pepperdine University's chapel.

The station is situated on the Borderlands line. Transport for Wales operates the station and all trains serving it. History Upton Station was opened to passengers on 18 May 1896, as part of the Dee and Birkenhead Railway. The station became part of the North Wales and Liverpool Railway, less than three months later, on 7 July 1896. The station had a booking office on the road bridge which spans the two platforms.Flickr - 92xxx Upton Stn. 19.7.67 Accessed 2014-06-07 Staffing ended on 20 April 1969, with the booking office removed during redevelopment of the station and expansion of the road bridge in the 1970s. The station had a brick-built waiting room situated on each platform. =Freight and goods= Adjacent to the station there was a coal and goods yard with a cattle pen. From 1 February 1965, the goods yard only handled coal, and closed on 28 April 1969. The site of the goods yard now has a Co-operative supermarket. Access to the yard was operated by a small signal box with a 24-lever frame, which was used until 25 June 1969. The signal box was situated at the southern end of the Bidston-bound platform.Flickr - 92057 Upton Stn. 19.7.67 Accessed 2014-06-07 Iron ore freight trains also passed through the station. These freight trains operated from Bidston Dock to the John Summers steelworks in Shotton. The Class 9F locomotive 92203, later named as Black Prince, worked the final steam-hauled iron ore train in November 1967. The freight service itself ended around 1980. Future Proposals have been put forward to electrify the track as part of the proposed Borderlands line electrification scheme. Merseyrail would like to see the line electrified and incorporated into the Wirral line to link with its own third-rail service, with a doubling of the frequency of services. This would allow the station to serve as a part of a direct service to Liverpool. Transport for Wales have an Adopt a Station initiative.

Facilities The station facilities are somewhat rudimentary. Although longer, each platform is surfaced to receive four carriages only. The station is unstaffed, at nearly all times, but has platform CCTV.Station Facilities for Upton (Merseyside) Accessed 2013-12-18 Each of the two platforms has a waiting shelter with seating. There is no payphone or booking office, but there are electronic departure and arrival screens for live information to passengers. There is no official station car park, but very limited parking outside the station, at the drop-off point, on the old Ford Road bridge. Wheelchair and pram access to each of the two platforms is possible, and relatively easy, via the ramp- staircases.

A close associate of Prime Minister Ian Smith, Van der Byl opposed attempts to compromise with the British government and domestic black nationalist opposition on the issue of majority rule throughout most his time in government. However, in the late 1970s he supported the moves which led to majority rule and internationally recognised independence for Zimbabwe. Van der Byl was born and raised in Cape Town, the son of the South African politician P V van der Byl, and served in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War. After a high-flying international education, he moved to the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading agitators for Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Van der Byl was afterwards responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia, but was popular among members of his own party. Promoted to the cabinet in 1968, Van der Byl became a spokesman for the Rhodesian government and crafted a public image as a die-hard supporter of continued white minority rule. In 1974 he was made Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence at a time when Rhodesia's only remaining ally, South Africa, was supplying military aid. His extreme views and brusque manner made him a surprising choice for a diplomat (a November 1976 profile in The Times described him as \\"a man calculated to give offence\\"David Spanier, \\"Rhodesia's Foreign Minister a man calculated to give offence\\", The Times, Thursday 4 November 1976, page 7). After offending the South African government, Van der Byl was removed from the Defence Ministry. In the late 1970s Van der Byl was willing to endorse the Smith government's negotiations with moderate black nationalist leaders and rejected attempts by international missions to broker an agreement. He served in the short-lived government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement. After the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, Van der Byl remained in politics and close to Ian Smith; he loudly attacked former RF colleagues who had gone over to support Robert Mugabe. He retired to South Africa after the Mugabe government abolished the parliamentary seats reserved for whites in 1987, and died in 1999 at the age of 76. Family and early life Van der Byl was born in Cape Town, the son of Joyce Clare Fleming, a Scot, and Dutch- descended Major Pieter Voltelyn Graham van der Byl, a member of Jan Smuts' South African cabinet during World War II. Like his father, Van der Byl was educated at the Diocesan College in RondeboschRhodesian Personalities: Pieter Kenyon Fleming-Voltelyn van der Byl but his studies were interrupted by war in 1941.Obituary: Pieter van der Byl: Rich, white aristocrat behind Rhodesia's bid to stop black rule, Dan van der Vat, The Guardian, 30 November 1999, p. 22 He served with the South African Army during the Second World War and served with the British 7th Queen's Own Hussars; he saw active service in the Middle East, Italy and Austria. After being demobilised, Van der Byl studied law at Pembroke College, CambridgeList of Members of Cambridge University where his aristocratic manner stood out. \\"P. K.\\" was always elegantly dressed and coiffured, and acquired the nickname \\"the Piccadilly Dutchman\\". He obtained a Third-class degree in his Part II Law examinations in 1947,Historical Register of Cambridge University, supplement 1941‚Äì1950 (Cambridge University Press, 1952), p. 208 and went on from Cambridge to study at the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration from 1947 to 1948 (although he did not obtain a degree at the latter).Harvard Alumni Directory 1986, p. 1256. Van der Byl is counted in the Class of 1949. He also studied at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.: The main players One of the most conspicuous features of Van der Byl was his manner of speech: although his ancestry was Cape Dutch and his early life was in Cape Town, South Africa, he had what were described (by Chris Whitehead, editor of Rhodesians Worldwide) as \\"what he thought was an aristocratic English nasal drawl and imperial English mannerisms\\".PK, Chris Whitehead Rhodesian personalities Whitehead was of the opinion that Van der Byl had \\"adopted\\" this accent, in common with others who heard him like Denis Hills, who wrote of Van der Byl having \\"a flow of mannered phrases which he delivers in a flawed Guards officer accent\\".Rebel People, Denis Hills, George Allen and Unwin, 1978, page 204 This Rhodesian newspaper cartoon shows another reaction. This personal characteristic was intensely irritating to many people including South African government ministers, but Van der Byl's aristocratic mannerisms appeared uncontentious to many Rhodesian whites. They believed that his \\"nasal drawl\\" was the product of his time as an officer in the Hussars and his Cambridge education: William Higham described him as \\"a popular Minister of Defence who, despite his British upper crust accent ‚Äì undoubtedly honed during his swashbuckling career as an officer in the hussars ‚Äì hailed from a noble Cape family.\\" =Move to Rhodesia= Van der Byl moved to Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage some of his family's tobacco farming interests, hoping to make his own fortune. Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he \\"suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going to go up there and make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in.\\" He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest elephant shot, which stood until 1955.\\"Pieter van der Byl\\" (obituary), The Times, 10 January 2000, p. 19 In 1957 Van der Byl was made a Director of the United Dominions Corporation (Rhodesia) Ltd, having already become an active member of the Rhodesia Tobacco Association. In 1956, he was elected by the members of the Selous‚ÄìGadzema district to represent them on the Tobacco Association council. He was also Deputy Chair of the Selous Farmers' Association in 1957. His first involvement in government was in 1960 when the Rhodesia Tobacco Association made him one of their representatives on the National Native Labour Commission, on which he served for two years. In 1961, he also represented the Rhodesia Tobacco Association on the council of the Rhodesian National Farmers' Union.\\"Who's Who of Southern Africa 1971\\", Rhodesia, Central and East Africa Section, Combined Publishers (Pty.) Ltd, Johannesburg 1971, p. 1286‚Äì154 He was recognised as a leading spokesman for Rhodesian tobacco farmers. Dominion Party politician Winston Field had also led the Rhodesia Tobacco Association, and Van der Byl agreed with him on politics in general. He joined the Rhodesian Front when it was set up under Field's leadership. At the 1962 general election, Van der Byl was elected comfortably to the Legislative Assembly for the Hartley constituency, a rural area to the south-west of Salisbury.Source Book of Parliamentary Elections and Referenda in Southern Rhodesia 1898‚Äì1962 ed. by F.M.G. Willson (Department of Government, University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Salisbury, 1963), p. 197 Political career =Ministerial office= In 1963, Winston Field appointed Van der Byl as a junior government whip, and on 16 March 1964 he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for the Information Service.\\"Holders of Administrative and Ministerial Office 1894‚Äì1964 and Members of the Legislative Council 1899‚Äì1923 and the Legislative Assembly 1924‚Äì1964\\" by F.M.G. Willson and G.C. Passmore, University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, 1965. Although the Van der Byl family were identified as strongly liberal in South African politics, he became identified with the right wing of the party and helped to depose Field from the premiership in early April 1964, when Field failed to persuade the British government to grant Southern Rhodesia its independence. The new Prime Minister, Ian Smith, appointed him Deputy Minister for Information. At this time, Van der Byl's chief adviser was a South African called Ivor Benson, who also served as press censor.The Radical Right: A World Directory, Ciar√°n √ì Maol√°in (editor), Longman, 1987, page 244 Benson believed that an international communist conspiracy was plotting to overthrow white rule in Rhodesia.The Impact of anti-communism on white Rhodesian political culture c.1920-1980, D Lowry, in Cold War in Southern Africa: White Power, Black Liberation, Sue Onslow, (editor) Routledge, 2009, page 94 Speaking in the Legislative Assembly on 12 August 1964 he attacked proposals for greater independence for broadcasters by referring to what he perceived to be the social effect in Britain: :To suggest that the BBC, forming opinion in the minds of the people of England, has been an influence for good in any way, when you consider the criminality of large areas of London; when you consider the Mods and Rockers, and all those other things; when you consider the total moral underminings which have been taking place in England, much to all our distress, in the last fifteen to twenty years, the Hon. Member can hardly bring that up as an argument in favour of the freedom of broadcasting. Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion, James P. Barber, Institute of Race Relations, 1967, page 291 By the end of 1964, Van der Byl and his Ministry had control of broadcasting in Rhodesia.Robert Blake, \\"A History of Rhodesia\\", Eyre Methuen, 1977, p. 367 Speaking in Parliament he described the aims of his Department as \\"not merely to disseminate information from an interesting point of view but to play its part in fighting the propaganda battle on behalf of the country\\". Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion, James P. Barber, Institute of Race Relations, 1967, page 293 He defined propaganda as \\"simply the propagation of the faith and the belief in any particular ideology or thing\\", and also stated that the Department would seek the \\"resuscitation of the determination of the European to survive and fight for his rights\\". Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion, James P. Barber, Institute of Race Relations, 1967, page 293 =1965 election= In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front government went to the country in a general election with Van der Byl one of the leading campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that only a small fraction of Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited Johannesburg mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, big business support for the Nazi Party in Germany, and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia being financed by United States big business.Larry W. Bowman, \\"Politics in Rhodesia: White Power in an African State\\", Harvard University Press, 1973, p. 80, citing Rhodesia Herald, 30 April 1965 and 5 May 1965 The Rhodesian Front won a landslide victory, winning every single one of the 50 constituencies which had predominantly European voters. At the Rhodesian Front Congress of August 1965, party members strongly attacked the press for failing to support the government. A demand for it to be made compulsory for all political articles to be signed by the author met with Van der Byl's approval.Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion by James Barber (Oxford University Press, 1967), p. 283 =UDI= Within the government, Van der Byl was one of the loudest voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. He angrily denounced the threat of sanctions from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition.\\"New warning by Smith on independence\\", The Times, Wednesday 5 May 1965, p. 9 Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to David Steel, he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government.David Steel, \\"I told you so from the start\\", The Times, Thursday 6 March 1980, p. 16 He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 OctoberRhodesia Government Gazette, vol. 43 (1965) and so was present at, but did not sign, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965. The signing of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence. Van der Byl appears, obscured, in a light-coloured suit at the top right of the picture. Van der Byl was greeted by a speech strongly critical of the Rhodesian government from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, who supported the use of armed force to bring the Rhodesians in line with United Kingdom policy on decolonisation. He responded by comparing the speech to \\"the tragic connivance at the destruction of Czechoslovakia in exchange for the useless appeasement at Munich in 1938\\".\\"Speech deplored by Minister\\", The Times, Thursday 28 October 1965, p. 12 Van der Byl's response used the phrase \\"kith and kin\\" to refer to the ethnic links between the white Rhodesians and the people of the United Kingdom. He saw no contradiction between signing a letter declaring \\"constant loyalty\\" to the Queen and declaring independence a few days later; the Rhodesian Government was careful at the time of UDI to state its continued loyalty to the British Crown, though it later declared Rhodesia a republic. Despite his enthusiasm for propaganda, Van der Byl was outraged when the BBC subsequently set up a radio station at Francistown in Botswana which broadcast for 27 months, criticising UDI and urging Rhodesians to revoke it. He was later to claim the station was inciting violence,Letter from P.K. van der Byl to The Times published on Wednesday, 25 January 1978, p. 17 although this was denied by some who had been regular listeners.Letter from H.C. Norwood to The Times published on Monday, 20 February 1978, p. 15 On 26 January 1966, two months after the UDI, Van der Byl was willing to be quoted as saying that Rhodesian Army troops would follow a \\"scorched earth\\" policy should the United Kingdom send in troops, comparing their position to that of the Red Army when Nazi forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. He was highly critical of Harold Wilson, describing him as a \\"highly dangerous, uninformed and conceited little man.\\"\\"'Scorched Earth' in Rhodesia if Britain sends troops\\", The Times, Thursday, 27 January 1966, p. 10 =Censorship= Rhodesia Herald front page of 21 September 1966 shows the effect of censorship imposed by Van der Byl's ministry. Internally, his policy was enforced through Ministry control of TV and radio and through censorship of newspapers. From 31 December 1965, the Ministry of Information expanded its brief and was renamed the Ministry of Information, Immigration and Tourism, which meant that it was also responsible for deciding whether to grant or revoke permits to visit Rhodesia. Several foreign journalists were expelled: John Worrall, correspondent for The Guardian, went in January 1969. The Rhodesia Herald, then in opposition to both the Rhodesian Front and UDI, frequently appeared with large white spaces on its news pages where censored stories had been placed. Stories and editorials personally critical of Van der Byl were immediately removed. Censorship was tightened still further on 8 February 1966 when it was made illegal to indicate where material had been removed. The censor was also given the power to alter existing material or to move it around the newspaper. Dr Ahrn Palley, the lone white opposition MP, described the powers as \\"censorship gone mad\\", and insisted that there would no longer be any guarantee that anything published in the newspapers was authentic. Van der Byl responded by saying that the new measures were a reflection on the newspapers which had made such powers necessary.\\"Drastic powers for the Rhodesian Censor\\", The Times, Wednesday, 9 February 1966, p. 10 In 1967 Van der Byl was reported by Malcolm Smith, the former editor of the Herald, as remarking that a high degree of self-censorship was required, and support for the government was essential.Malcolm Smith, \\"How censorship has affected the Rhodesian press\\", The Times, Tuesday, 7 November 1967, p. 11 The Herald (and the Bulawayo Chronicle) defied the restrictions, boldly printing blank spaces which identified removed material. Van der Byl personally visited the newspaper offices on the day the new regulations came in to warn the staff that if the paper was printed as proposed, they would \\"publish at your peril.\\" However the papers continued to appear with identifiable censorship in defiance of the government, and in 1968 the regulations were scrapped. Deportation Shortly after UDI, 46 academics working at University College, a racially non- segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to The Times in London, denouncing the move. Officers of the British South Africa Police visited many of those who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which would normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.Christopher Hill, \\"The crisis facing Rhodesia's non-racial university\\", The Times, Monday, 8 August 1966, p. 9 Van der Byl's strategy seemed to work at home, with many Rhodesians remaining unaware until the end just how much was their country's vulnerability and isolation. The Times was later to describe him as a \\"skilled propagandist who believed his own propaganda.\\" When sanctions on Rhodesia were confirmed in January 1967, Van der Byl compared their situation with Spain following World War II, saying that the isolation of Spain had not stopped it from becoming one of the most advanced and economically successful countries in Europe. However, when Van der Byl made informal approaches in April 1966 to see if he might visit Britain \\"for social reasons\\" during a tour of Europe, the Commonwealth Relations Office replied that he would not be recognised as enjoying any form of recognition or immunity.\\"Rebuff to a Rhodesian Minister\\", The Times, Tuesday, 3 May 1966, p. 1 Other European governments refused to recognise his passport and expelled him from the country.Hansard, 5 December 1966, vol. 737, col. 1065 =Wider role in politics= On 13 September 1968 he was promoted to be the full Minister of Information, Immigration and Tourism. Van der Byl's aristocratic background, military experience and academic credentials combined to give him an almost iconic status within the Rhodesian Front. Many were impressed by his exploits as a big-game hunter, which began when he shot his first lion in a garden in Northern Rhodesia at the age of 15. Writing in South Africa's Daily Dispatch, Michael Hartnack remarked that many in the Rhodesian Front believed him to be \\"a 19th century-style connoisseur, a man of culture and an aristocrat-statesman\\", adding that \\"poseurs are an incipient hazard in any unsophisticated society.\\"\\"White seal, Black messiah,\\" Michael Hartnack, Daily Dispatch, Tuesday, 6 November 2001 Within the somewhat claustrophobic confines of white Rhodesian society outside the RF, Van der Byl was achieving some degree of respect. In politics he assumed the position of hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opponents or the international community. He made little secret of his willingness to succeed Ian Smith as Prime Minister if Smith showed even \\"the least whiff of surrender,\\" and did his best to discourage attempts to get the Rhodesians to compromise. When Abel Muzorewa had his passport withdrawn in September 1972 after returning from a successful visit to London, the government did not attempt to counter the rumour that its action was taken following Van der Byl's personal order.\\"Bishop Muzorewa has his passport taken away\\", The Times, Monday, 11 September 1972, p. 5 In April 1972 Van der Byl sparked a row over the agreement which Rhodesia and the United Kingdom had made in November 1971. Under this agreement, Rhodesia had agreed to certain concessions to African nationalism in return for the prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of the agreement was to be delayed until the Pearce Commission reported on whether the settlement proposals would be approved by the people of Rhodesia. Van der Byl insisted that Rhodesia would not implement any part of the agreement unless Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the European, Asian and Coloured (mixed race) populations of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, the agreement was ditched. Many outside and inside Rhodesia had hoped that the government would implement some of the agreement even if Pearce reported against it.\\"Tougher Rhodesian line on settlement proposals\\", The Times, Monday, 10 April 1972, p. 5 His derision of working class British Labour politicians also caused problems. When, in January 1966, three visiting Labour MPs were manhandled, kicked and punched while attempting to address 400 supporters of the Rhodesian Front, Van der Byl blamed the three for refusing an offer from his Ministry to co-ordinate the visit, and pointed out that they were breaking the law which required government permission for any political meeting of more than 12 people.\\"British M.P.s manhandled by Mr. Smith's supporters\\", The Times, Thursday, 13 January 1966, p. 10. See also BBC News online 'On this day'. The propaganda circulated by his Ministry (typically including references to \\"happy, smiling natives\\") was considered laughable. Visiting British journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, who knew Van der Byl socially, reported seeing a copy of Mein Kampf on his coffee table.Interview for Centre for Contemporary British History witness seminars. (\\"I remember being shocked to find open on the coffee table in PK's house, who was then Minister of Information (I am not sure even if he had such a grand title, he ultimately of course became Foreign Minister, war minister to all intents and purposes) a recently perused copy of Mein Kampf. This bears out your comment about the fascist element, which cannot be overlooked. I was fond of PK, but he was a racial supremacist admirer of Hitler.\\") His propaganda strategy became increasingly unsuccessful abroad, where Van der Byl alienated many of the foreign journalists and politicians that he came into contact with. Max Hastings, then reporting for the Evening Standard, described him as \\"that grotesque parody of a Dornford Yates English gentleman\\" and said that he and Smith \\"would have seemed ludicrous figures, had they not possessed the power of life and death over millions of people\\"; Van der Byl had him deported.Going to the Wars, Max Hastings, Macmillan, 2000, pages 185-189 While still popular with the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the 1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in improving Rhodesia's image around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation. Allan Savory, then the lone white opposition MP, criticised the Bill for the composition of the proposed board, which was dominated by strong supporters of the Rhodesian Front. Van der Byl insisted, somewhat unsuccessfully to foreign observers, that the government was not trying to take over broadcasting.\\"Sect members accused of evading conscription\\", The Times, Thursday, 6 December 1973, p. 7 =Minister of Defence= Van der Byl was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August 1974. These were two distinct portfolios, the first of which (Foreign Affairs) did not amount to much in a state which lacked any form of international recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience had been largely in the area of public relations, he was now charged with responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia. He promoted aggressive measures against the insurgents, and in so doing, he also sought to raise his own political profile. Clad in immaculately tailored battledress, he would fly by helicopter to a beleaguered army outpost; wearing dark glasses and sporting a swagger stick, deliver a rousing speech for the benefit of the troops and the TV cameras ‚Äì then return to Salisbury in time for dinner. He drew heavily on Winston Churchill's oratory style for some of his inspiring speeches.OurStory posting :account of a PK tour of inspection, 1974 As Minister of Defence, Van der Byl was known to join army counter-insurgency operations while armed with a hunting rifle (with the words \\"I'd like to bag one of these chaps ...\\"), and would regularly visit army positions and entertain the troops with his own generous supply of \\"scotch whisky and fine wines.\\" Such behaviour endeared him to many in Rhodesia: he was far more popular with the troops than his predecessor as Minister of Defence, Jack Howman. However, this popularity did not extend to senior members of the South African and Rhodesian governments. Rhodesia's strategic position underwent a fundamental change in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia. There were rumours in February 1976 that Soviet tanks were being unloaded in Mozambique to help in the war. Unluckily for Van der Byl, the British Foreign Office minister was David Ennals, one of those who had received rough treatment in 1966. Ennals announced that in the event of a racial war breaking out in Rhodesia, there would be no British help. Van der Byl responded by claiming this indicated Britain accepting Rhodesia's independence.\\"Rhodesia says any Soviet interference would be 'naked aggression'\\", The Times, Tuesday, 17 February 1976, p. 6 He attacked Abel Muzorewa for supporting President Machel, saying that \\"being a good churchman and a Bishop there is a very strong possibility he might be a communist\\".Nicholas Ashford, \\"Rhodesia admits 1,000 guerillas are operating inside border\\", The Times, Saturday, 6 March 1976, p. 4 Following the example of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments permitted guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter that this had to be expected.Michael Knipe, \\"Rebels open third front against Rhodesia\\", The Times, Friday, 11 June 1976, p. 7 As infiltration grew, he declared at the beginning of July that the Rhodesian Army would not hesitate to bomb and destroy villages that harboured guerillas.Michael Knipe, \\"Smith Cabinet rejects plan to open white farm areas to blacks\\", The Times, Saturday, 3 July 1976. Page 5 In 1975 and 1976, the South African government conducted delicate negotiations with neighbouring states: the South Africans wanted to encourage those states to maintain economic relations with South Africa and Rhodesia while limiting the activities of the ANC, ZANU and ZAPU. However, increasingly aggressive actions by the Rhodesian army outside its own borders resulted in the failure of this conciliatory approach. A cross-border Selous Scouts raid into Mozambique on 9 August 1976 (dubbed \\"the Nyadzonya Raid\\") killed over 1,000 people without Rhodesian fatalities, with Van der Byl insisting that the government had irrefutable proof that the raid had targeted a guerrilla training camp. He was unwilling to disclose the nature of the proof, though he invited the UN to conduct its own investigation into the raid.Michael Knipe, \\"Rhodesians ask UN to investigate camp raid\\", The Times, Wednesday, 25 August 1976. Page 1 The raid produced a high body count and a major haul of intelligence and captured arms; according to ZANLA's own figures, which were not publicly circulated, most of those present in the camp had been armed guerrillas, though there were some civilians present. In a successful attempt to win global sympathy, ZANU clamoured that Nyadzonya had been full of unarmed refugees, leading most international opinion to condemn the Rhodesian raid as a massacre. Although cross-border raids into Mozambique had been approved by the Rhodesian cabinet, the depth and severity of the August incursion was greater than had been intended. Van der Byl had sanctioned the incursion largely on his own initiative. Although a tactical success, the incursion caused a final break with Zambia and Mozambique. The South African government was greatly displeased that its earlier diplomatic efforts were compromised and made this clear to Ian Smith. Smith appeared to consider this \\"the final straw\\" as far as Van der Byl's defence portfolio was concerned.The Past is Another Country, Martin Meredith, p280 =Foreign affairs= Van der Byl took over at a time when South Africa was putting increasing pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March 1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town to explain why the Rhodesian government had detained Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo.Michael Knipe, \\"Sithole arrest linked with death list\\", The Times, Friday, 7 March 1975, p. 8 Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him. Victoria Falls Conference took place at the centre of the Victoria Falls Bridge in August 1975. Gradually the South Africans grew unwilling to help Rhodesia. The remaining 200 South African policemen transferred to help in the guerilla war were removed suddenly in August 1975, a move which appeared to precede even more disengagement. Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted that \\"The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who invade our country with the willing help of other governments are here for a much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia. They are here to represent a force which sees Rhodesia as just one more stepping stone to victory over South Africa because they see South Africa as a vital key to the security of America, Europe and the rest of the western world.\\"\\"Relations under strain at Pretoria meeting\\", The Times, Saturday, 9 August 1975, p. 1 When the Rhodesian government held talks with the African National Council on the railway bridge across the Victoria Falls in August 1975 (the train in which the talks took place was strategically in the middle of the bridge so that the ANC were in Zambia while the Rhodesians remained in Rhodesia), Van der Byl was not a member of the Rhodesian delegation. This was a curious omission given his position. He did however participate in talks with Joshua Nkomo that December. Van der Byl's habit of referring to the African population as \\"munts\\" (he asserted that \\"Rhodesia is able to handle the munts\\"\\"Chilly reception awaits Rhodesian leader after television remark\\", The Times, Monday, 20 October 1975, p. 4) led to extreme unpopularity with the South African government,The White Tribes Revisited, Richard West, Private Eye Productions, 1978, page 49 and he did not attend talks with South African Prime Minister John Vorster in October 1975.Summary of World Broadcasts: Non- Arab Africa, BBC Monitoring Service, Issues 5021-5096, 1975 This was interpreted as being connected to Vorster's dislike of Van der Byl who, despite being of Afrikaner origin, had adopted English mannerisms.Private Eye, Issues 393-407; Issues 409-418, 1977, page 4 When, on 26 August 1976, the South African government announced the withdrawal of all its military helicopter crews from Rhodesia, Van der Byl was outspoken in his criticism and Vorster was reported to have refused to have anything to do with \\"that dreadful man Van der Byl.\\" Smith decided that he \\"clearly ... had no option\\" and on 9 September 1976 executed a sudden cabinet reshuffle that ended Van der Byl's tenure as Defence Minister. Smith claimed the South African dislike of Van der Byl was partly motivated by the memory of his father, who had been in opposition to the National Party. =Contribution to diplomacy= As the prominence of the issue of Rhodesia increased in the late 1970s, attention on Van der Byl increased. Reporters noted his impressively quotable lines at press conferences (such as his explanation for why the Rhodesian government did not usually give the names of guerrillas which it had hanged: \\"Why should we? Anyway, it's academic because they're normally dead after it\\").The Past Is Another Country: Rhodesia 1890-1979, Martin Meredith, A. Deutsch, 1979, page 284 While negotiating with the Patriotic Front put together by ZANU and ZAPU at the Geneva Conference in November 1976, he described ZANU leader Robert Mugabe as \\"this bloodthirsty Marxist puppet\\" and the Patriotic Front proposals as \\"almost a parody, a music hall caricature of communist invective\\".A Short Thousand Years: The End of Rhodesia's Rebellion, Paul L. Moorcraft, Galaxie Press, 1979, page 55 Mugabe repeatedly arrived late to the meetings held during the conference, and on one occasion Van der Byl tersely reprimanded the ZANU leader for his tardiness. Mugabe flew into a rage and shouted across the table at Van der Byl, calling the Rhodesian minister a \\"foul-mouthed bloody fool!\\" At this conference, which was organised by Britain with American support, Van der Byl rejected the idea of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified as one of the few ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement.\\"'British presence' idea rebuffed by Mr Smith\\", The Times, Saturday, 4 December 1976, p. 4 The conference was adjourned by the British foreign minister, Anthony Crosland, on 14 December 1976, and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion. Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.\\"Rhodesia rejects all proposals\\", The Times, Saturday, 8 January 1977, p. 1 Later that month, Van der Byl was finding pressure put on him by more moderate voices within Rhodesia and hinted that the government might amend the Land Tenure Act, which effectively split the country into sections reserved for each racial group. He also remarked that Bishop Abel Muzorewa \\"can be said to represent the African in this country\\",Michael Knipe, \\"Mr Richard warns Salisbury not to reject peace plan\\", The Times, Friday, 21 January 1977, p. 6 which indicated the direction in which the Smith government was hoping to travel: an accommodation with moderate voices within Rhodesia was likely to be a better end than a capitulation to the Patriotic Front. Van der Byl was prepared to support this strategy and did not go along with the 12 Rhodesian Front MPs who formed the Rhodesian Action Party in early 1977 claiming that the Front had not adhered to party principles. Although Van der Byl was now prepared to say that he supported the transition to majority rule, he was quick to put restrictions on it when interviewed in April 1977. He insisted that majority rule would only be possible on a \\"very qualified franchise‚Äîthat's what the whole thing is about\\", and also said that any settlement must be endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the existing House of Assembly (which was largely elected by white Rhodesians).Michael Knipe, \\"Mr Van der Byl demands guerrillas scale down war before Rhodesia settlement\\", The Times, Monday, 25 April 1977, p. 5 Over the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.\\"Warning of 'white backlash'\\", The Times, Wednesday, 29 June 1977, p. 6 However, the Rhodesian government was forced to put its internal settlement negotiations on hold during a joint US- UK initiative in late 1977. Van der Byl's public comments seemed to be aimed at ensuring this mission did not succeed, as he insisted that it had no chance of negotiating a ceasefire, described the Carter administration as \\"mindless\\", and the joint mission as being \\"Anglo-American-Russian\\".Nicholas Ashford, \\"Rhodesian doubts on Carver mission\\", The Times, Wednesday, 2 November 1977; p. 8 When a plan was published, he described it as \\"totally outrageous\\" and involving \\"the imposition of unconditional surrender on an undefeated people who are not enemies\\".\\"Lord Carver denies he was given 'brush off' by leaders in Africa\\", The Times, Friday, 11 November 1977, p. 8 =Internal settlement= The mission did fail and the internal settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.Rhodesia: New Black Foreign Minister, Dr. Elliott Gabellah Criticises American Opposition to Internal Settlement Plans, ITN, 17 April 1978 The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978Rory Peck Trust :list of journalists killed in war after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.\\"Lord Richard Cecil\\" (obituary), The Times, Saturday, 22 April 1978, p. 16 In May Van der Byl greeted news of massacres in Zaire as \\"a blessing in disguise\\" because they might ensure that warnings about Soviet penetration in Africa were heeded.\\"Kolwezi 'a blessing in disguise'\\", The Times, Monday, 29 May 1978, p. 5 He denounced the British government the following month for refusing to recognise that a massacre of Elim missionaries was perpetrated by the Patriotic Front.Frederick Cleary, \\"Call from Salisbury for Owen explanation\\", The Times, Wednesday, 28 June 1978, p. 8 As the date for the full implementation of the internal settlement grew nearer, Van der Byl's profile decreased, but he remained active in politics: he was elected unopposed for the whites-only Gatooma/Hartley seat to the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia House of Assembly. He handed over power to his African successor on 1 June 1979, and became instead Minister of Transport and Power and Minister of Posts in the new government. =Lancaster House= When \\"the wheels came off the wagon\\" (as he put it) at Lancaster House in 1979, Van der Byl greeted the event with amused detachment. He was not a member of any delegation at the conference and did not attend. The weekend after the agreement, he called on the Rhodesian Front to revitalise itself as the only true representative of Europeans in Rhodesia,Nicholas Ashford, \\"Future looks doubtful for Smith party\\", The Times, Saturday, 17 November 1979, p. 5 and he ascribed the result of the conference to \\"a succession of perfidious British governments\\".David Spanier, \\"Ceasefire accord sought this week\\", The Times, Monday, 19 November 1979, p. 5 According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl organised a meeting between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning. They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March dented this confidence. Smith asked Walls for details of his plan (\\"Operation Quartz\\")Operation Quartz ‚Äì Rhodesia 1980 for using force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl believed that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that it was already too late, and while the others wished for some move, they were forced to concede to this view. =In Zimbabwe= Van der Byl had been elected unopposed to the new House of Assembly for Gatooma/Hartley and remained a close associate of Smith, becoming Vice-President of the 'Republican Front' (later renamed the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe). At the 1985 general election the boundaries for the White Roll seats were altered and Van der Byl fought in Mount Pleasant, opposing Chris Andersen.Jan Raath, \\"Time stands still for Smith as whites face up to reality\\", The Times, Thursday, 27 June 1985, p. 5 Andersen had broken with the Rhodesian Front to sit as an Independent and became Minister of State for the Public Service in Robert Mugabe's government. Van der Byl lost the election heavily,Jan Raath, \\"Smith wins battle in Bulawayo\\", The Times, Friday, 28 June 1985, p. 5 polling only 544 votes to 1,017 for Andersen and 466 for a third candidate. The Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe still controlled the election of ten white Senators and Smith agreed to elect Van der Byl to one of the Senate seats. Parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished in 1987. Van der Byl made his last speech in Parliament on 10 September, in which he praised Robert Mugabe for the \\"absolute courtesy\\" he had shown since independence. He noted that he was the last surviving member of the 1965 government remaining in Parliament, and declared he hoped \\"I would have been cherished .. as a sort of national monument, and not flung into the political wilderness\\". His speech loudly denounced the former Republican Front and Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe members who had gone over to the government, describing them as \\"dreadful souls screaming in agony\\". The government minister Dr Edson Zvobgo responded with a poem referring to the number of rebels killed fighting troops under Van der Byl's command.Jan Raath, \\"Zimbabwe prize-fighters don kid gloves\\", The Times, Saturday, 12 September 1987, p. 7 Marriage, issue and retirement On 31 August 1979 at Schloss Waldstein in Deutschfeistritz, Austria, Van der Byl married Princess Charlotte Maria Benedikte Eleonore Adelheid of Liechtenstein. She was thirty years his junior, the daughter of Prince Heinrich of Liechtenstein and granddaughter of Karl I, the last emperor of Austria. The couple had three sons: Pieter Vincenz, Valerian, and Casimir. In 1983 Van der Byl had inherited from his mother a property described as \\"the magnificent estate .. near Caledon in the Western Cape,\\" and following the end of his political career had no need to keep a home in Zimbabwe, so he quit the place. He left as a rich man, with an attractive young wife, and enjoyed his retirement. He frequently visited London, where he was a good friend of Viscount Cranborne, who put him up for membership of the Turf Club.Paul Vallely and John Rentoul, \\"A Lordly plot to save their place\\", The Independent, 4 December 1996, p. 16 Both were members of White's Club and were often seen there when Van der Byl was in town.\\"Pinochet revisited\\", Evening Standard, 18 January 1999.

Lying to the east of the town of Brixham, it is a national nature reserve and a local nature reserve. Berry Head To Sharkham Point is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Berry Head Hotel Ecology Berry Head to Sharkham Point is a haven for several nationally rare and threatened species which are dependent upon the thin limestone soils, mild climate and exposed conditions of the headland. The coastal cliffs here are home to a seabird colony, including guillemots, razorbills and kittiwakes. Several rare vagrant birds have occurred here, including the first British record of yelkouan shearwater in July 2008. More recently, a Hume's warbler was discovered in November 2014. The guillemot colony on the cliffs below the Southern Fort is one of the largest on England's south coast and can be closely watched live on CCTV in the Visitor Centre. Berry Head also acts as an important staging post for migrant birds; and is home to a significant number of cirl buntings. Gateway to the Geopark The site is one of only two locations in Great Britain at which the white rock-rose, small hare‚Äôs ear and small restharrow occurs. Spring gentian, honewort, and goldilocks aster are also dependent upon the thin soils, mild climate and exposed conditions of the headland. Caves at Berry Head are home to the endangered greater horseshoe bat. A small herd of North Devon cattle has been introduced to the headland to produce the cow pats that attract dung beetles on which young bats are particularly dependent for food. Fortifications Berry Head is the site of an Iron Age hill fort which was mostly destroyed by the construction between 1794 and 1804 of extensive fortifications to protect the Torbay naval anchorage against threatened invasion by French armies. The former artillery house now houses a public display, featuring details about the history of the area, its wildlife and how it became an important strategic point. Navigation aids Berry Head is the location for the Berry Head Lighthouse and a VOR/DME beacon used for air traffic control. Hospital The hospital was originally built by the Board of Ordnance as a military hospital in support of the three Napoleonic-era forts on Berry Head. Later it became the home of the hymnist and poet Henry Francis Lyte; it remained with Lyte's descendants until 1949 when it was turned into the Berry Head House Hotel. The building was also the home to the photographer Farnham Maxwell-Lyte. The cricketer Evelyn George Martin, a guest of Lyte's family, lived at Berry Head between his school terms at Eton College. A plaque was unveiled in May 2013 to commemorate Martin's time spent at the house.

Roosevelt had been the Vice President of the United States for only days when he succeeded to the presidency. A Republican, he ran for and won by a landslide a four-year term as president in 1904. He was succeeded by his prot√©g√© and chosen successor, William Howard Taft. A Progressive reformer, Roosevelt earned a reputation as a \\"trust buster\\" through his regulatory reforms and antitrust prosecutions. His presidency saw the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which established the Food and Drug Administration to regulate food safety, and the Hepburn Act, which increased the regulatory power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Roosevelt took care, however, to show that he did not disagree with trusts and capitalism in principle, but was only against monopolistic practices. His \\"Square Deal\\" included regulation of railroad rates and pure foods and drugs; he saw it as a fair deal for both the average citizen and the businessmen. Sympathetic to both business and labor, Roosevelt avoided labor strife, most notably negotiating a settlement to the great Coal Strike of 1902. He vigorously promoted the conservation movement, emphasizing efficient use of natural resources. He dramatically expanded the system of national parks and national forests. After 1906, he moved to the left, attacking big business, proposing a welfare state, and supporting labor unions. In foreign affairs, Roosevelt sought to uphold the Monroe Doctrine and to establish the United States as a strong naval power and took charge of building the Panama Canal, which greatly increased access to the Pacific and increased American security interests and trade opportunities. He inherited the colonial empire acquired in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898). He ended the United States Military Government in Cuba and committed to a long-term occupation of the Philippines. Much of his foreign policy focused on the threats posed by Japan in the Pacific and Germany in the Caribbean Sea. Seeking to minimize European power in Latin America, he mediated the Venezuela Crisis and declared the Roosevelt Corollary. Roosevelt mediated the Russo- Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), for which he won the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. He pursued closer relations with Great Britain. Biographer William Harbaugh argues: :In foreign affairs, Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs legacy is judicious support of the national interest and promotion of world stability through the maintenance of a balance of power; creation or strengthening of international agencies, and resort to their use when practicable ; and implicit resolve to use military force, if feasible, to foster legitimate American interests. In domestic affairs, it is the use of government to advance the public interest. \\"If on this new continent,\\" he said, \\"we merely build another country of great but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have done nothing.\\"William H. Harbaugh, \\"Roosevelt, Theodore (27 October 1858‚Äì06 January 1919)\\" American National Biography (1999) online Historian Thomas Bailey, who generally disagreed with Roosevelt's policies, nevertheless concluded, \\"Roosevelt was a great personality, a great activist, a great preacher of the moralities, a great controversialist, a great showman. He dominated his era as he dominated conversations...the masses loved him; he proved to be a great popular idol and a great vote-getter.\\"Thomas A. Bailey, Presidential Greatness (1966) p. 308 His image stands alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln on Mount Rushmore. Although Roosevelt has been criticized by some for his imperialism stance, he is often ranked by historians among the top-five greatest U.S. Presidents of all time... Accession Roosevelt's Inauguration Roosevelt served as assistant secretary of the navy and governor of New York before winning election as William McKinley's running mate in the 1900 presidential election. Roosevelt became president following the assassination of McKinley by anarchist Leon Czolgosz in Buffalo, New York; Czolgosz shot McKinley on September 6, 1901, and McKinley died on September 14. Roosevelt was sworn into office on the day of McKinley's death at the Ansley Wilcox House in Buffalo. John R. Hazel, U.S. District Judge for the Western District of New York, administered the oath of office. Being just a few weeks short of his 43rd birthday, Roosevelt became the youngest president in U.S. history, a distinction he still retains. When asked whether he was ready to take the oath, Roosevelt answered, Roosevelt would later state that he came into office without any particular domestic policy goals. He broadly adhered to most Republican positions on economic issues, with the partial exception of the protective tariff. Roosevelt had stronger views on the particulars of his foreign policy, as he wanted the United States to assert itself as a great power in international relations. Administration =Cabinet= Roosevelt's cabinet on his last day in office, 1909. At far left: Roosevelt Left to right in back of table: George B. Cortelyou, Charles Joseph Bonaparte, Robert Bacon, James Wilson, Truman Handy Newberry. Left to right in front of table: Oscar S. Straus, Luke Edward Wright, George von Lengerke Meyer, James Rudolph Garfield Anxious to ensure a smooth transition, Roosevelt convinced the members of McKinley's cabinet, most notably Secretary of State John Hay and Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage, to remain in office after McKinley's death.Morris (2001) pp 9-10 Another holdover from McKinley's cabinet, Secretary of War Elihu Root, had been a Roosevelt confidante for years, and he continued to serve as President Roosevelt's close ally.Morris (2001) pp 22-23 Attorney General Philander C. Knox, who McKinley had appointed in early 1901, also emerged as a powerful force within the Roosevelt administration.Morris (2001) p. 62 McKinley's personal secretary, George B. Cortelyou, remained in place under Roosevelt. Once Congress began its session in December 1901, Roosevelt replaced Gage with L. M. Shaw and appointed Henry C. Payne as Postmaster General, earning the approval of powerful Senators William B. Allison and John Coit Spooner.Morris (2001) p. 78 He also replaced his former boss, Secretary of the Navy John D. Long, with Congressman William H. Moody. In 1903, Roosevelt named Cortelyou as the first head of the Department of Commerce and Labor, and William Loeb Jr. became Roosevelt's secretary. Root returned to the private sector in 1904 and was replaced by William Howard Taft, who had previously served as the governor-general of the Philippines.Morris (2001) pp. 308-309 Knox accepted appointment to the Senate in 1904 and was replaced by William Moody, who in turn was succeeded as attorney general by Charles Joseph Bonaparte in 1906. After Hay's death in 1905, Roosevelt convinced Root to return to the Cabinet as secretary of state, and Root remained in office until the final days of Roosevelt's tenure.Morris (2001) pp. 394-395 In 1907, Roosevelt replaced Shaw with Cortelyou, while James R. Garfield became the new secretary of the interior. =Press corps= Building on McKinley's effective use of the press, Roosevelt made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities. Noticing the White House reporters huddled outside in the rain one day, he gave them their own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing. The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage, rendered the more possible by Roosevelt's practice of screening out reporters he didn't like. Judicial appointments Roosevelt appointed three associate justices of the Supreme Court. Roosevelt's first appointment, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. had served as chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court since 1899 and had earned notoriety within legal circles for his moral skepticism and deference to elected officials. Confirmed in December 1902, Holmes served on the Supreme Court until 1932.Morris (2001) pp. 129-131 Roosevelt's second appointment, former Secretary of State William R. Day, became a reliable vote for Roosevelt's antitrust prosecutions and remained on the court from 1903 to 1922.Morris (2001) pp. 313-314 In 1906, after considering Democratic appellate judge Horace Harmon Lurton for a Supreme Court vacancy, Roosevelt instead appointed Attorney General William Moody.Morris (2001) pp. 458-464 Moody served on the court until health problems forced his retirement in 1910. Roosevelt also appointed 71 other federal judges: 18 to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 53 to the United States district courts. Domestic policy =Progressivism= Determined to create what he called a \\"Square Deal\\" between business and labor, Roosevelt pushed several pieces of progressive legislation through Congress. Progressivism was among the most powerful political forces of the day, and Roosevelt was its most articulate spokesperson. Progressivism had dual aspects. First, progressivism promoted use of science, engineering, technology, and social sciences to address the nation's problems, and identify ways to eliminate waste and inefficiency and promote modernization.see George Mowry, The Era of Theodore Roosevelt and the Birth of Modern America, 1900‚Äì1912 (1954), ch. 1 Those promoting progressivism also campaigned against corruption among political machines, labor unions, and trusts of new, large corporations, which emerged at the turn of the century.see Lewis L. Gould, The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. (1991), ch 1 In describing Roosevelt's priorities and characteristics as president, historian G. Warren Chessman noted Roosevelt's =Trust busting and regulation= In the late-nineteenth century, several large businesses, including Standard Oil, had either bought their rivals or had established business arrangements that effectively stifled competition. Many companies followed the model of Standard Oil, which organized itself as a trust in which several component corporations were controlled by one board of directors. While Congress had passed the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act to provide some federal regulation of trusts, the Supreme Court had limited the power of the act in the case of United States v. E. C. Knight Co..Morris (2001) pp 27‚Äì30 By 1902, the 100 largest corporations held control of 40 percent of industrial capital in the United States. Roosevelt did not oppose all trusts, but sought to regulate trusts that he believed harmed the public, which he labeled as \\"bad trusts.\\" First term Upon taking office, Roosevelt proposed federal regulations of trusts. As the states had not prevented the growth of what he viewed as harmful trusts, Roosevelt advocated the creation of Cabinet department designed to regulate corporations engaged in interstate commerce. He also favored amending the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, which had failed to prevent the consolidation of railroads. In February 1902, the Justice Department announced that it would file an antitrust suit against the Northern Securities Company, a railroad holding company that had been formed in 1901 by J. P. Morgan, James J. Hill, and E. H. Harriman. As the Justice Department lacked an antitrust division, Attorney General Knox, a former corporate lawyer, personally led the suit. While the case was working its way through court, Knox filed another case against the \\"Beef Trust,\\" which had become unpopular due to rising meat prices. Combined with his earlier rhetoric, the suits signaled Roosevelt's resolve to strengthen the federal regulation of trusts. After the 1902 elections, Roosevelt called for a ban on railroad rebates to large industrial concerns, as well as for the creation of a Bureau of Corporations to study and report on monopolistic practices.Morris (2001) p. 195‚Äì196 To pass his antitrust package through Congress, Roosevelt appealed directly to the people, casting the legislation as a blow against the malevolent power of Standard Oil. Roosevelt's campaign proved successful, and he won congressional approval of the creation of the Department of Commerce and Labor, which included the Bureau of Corporations.Morris (2001) pp. 205‚Äì208 The Bureau of Corporations was designed to monitor and report on anti-competitive practices; Roosevelt believed that large companies would be less likely to engage in anti- competitive practices if such practices were publicized. At Knox's request, Congress also authorized the creation of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Roosevelt also won passage of the Elkins Act, which restricted the granting of railroad rebates. In March 1904, the Supreme Court ruled for the government in the case of Northern Securities Co. v. United States. According to historian Michael McGerr, the case represented the federal government's first victorious prosecution of a \\"single, tightly integrated interstate corporation.\\"McGerr (2003), p. 157 The following year, the administration won another major victory in Swift and Company v. United States, which broke up the Beef Trust. The evidence at trial demonstrated that, prior to 1902, the \\"Big Six\\" leading meatpackers had engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and divide the market for livestock and meat in their quest for higher prices and higher profits. They blacklisted competitors who failed to go along, used false bids, and accepted rebates from the railroads. After they were hit with federal injunctions in 1902, the Big Six had merged into one company, allowing them to continue to control the trade internally. Speaking for the unanimous court, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. held that interstate commerce included actions that were part of the chain where the chain was clearly interstate in character. In this case, the chain ran from farm to retail store and crossed many state lines.\\"The Supreme Court upholds Prosecution of the Beef Trust,\\" in Frank N. Magill, ed., Great Events from History II: Business and Commerce Series Volume 1 1897-1923 (1994) pp 107-111 Second term Following his re-election, Roosevelt sought to quickly enact a bold legislative agenda, focusing especially on legislation that would build upon the regulatory accomplishments of his first term. Events during his first term had convinced Roosevelt that legislation enacting additional federal regulation of interstate commerce was necessary, as the states were incapable of regulating large trusts that operated across state lines and the overworked Department of Justice was unable to provide an adequate check on monopolistic practices through antitrust cases alone. Roused by reports in McClure's Magazine, many Americans joined Roosevelt in calling for an enhancement to the Elkins Act, which had done relatively little to restrict the granting of railroad rebates.Morris (2001) pp. 417‚Äì419 Roosevelt also sought to strengthen the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which had been created in 1887 to regulate railroads. Roosevelt's call for regulatory legislation, published in his 1905 message to Congress, encountered strong opposition from business interests and conservative congressmen.Morris (2001) pp. 422‚Äì429 When Congress reconvened in late 1905, Roosevelt asked Senator Jonathan P. Dolliver of Iowa to introduce a bill that would incorporate Roosevelt's railroad regulatory proposals, and set about mobilizing public and congressional support for the bill. The bill was also taken up in the House, where it became known as the Hepburn Bill, named after Congressman William Peters Hepburn.Morris (2001) pp. 428‚Äì433 While the bill passed the House with relative ease, the Senate, dominated by conservative Republicans like Nelson Aldrich, posed a greater challenge.Morris (2001) pp. 442‚Äì443 Seeking to defeat reform efforts, Aldrich arranged it so that Democrat Benjamin Tillman, a Southern senator who Roosevelt despised, was left in charge of the bill. Because railroad regulation was widely popular, opponents of the Hepburn Bill focused on the role of courts in reviewing the ICC's rate- setting. Roosevelt and progressives wanted to limit judicial review to issues of procedural fairness, while conservatives favored \\"broad review\\" that would allow judges to determine whether the rates themselves were fair. After Roosevelt and Tillman were unable to assemble a bipartisan majority behind a bill that restricted judicial review, Roosevelt accepted an amendment written by Senator Allison that contained vague language allowing for court review of the ICC's rate-setting power. With the inclusion of the Allison amendment, the Senate passed the Hepburn Bill in a 71-to-3 vote. After both houses of Congress passed a uniform law, Roosevelt signed the Hepburn Act into law on June 29, 1906. In addition to rate-setting, the Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.Morris (2001) pp. 445‚Äì448 Though some conservatives believed that the Allison amendment had granted broad review powers to the courts, a subsequent Supreme Court case limited judicial power to review the ICC's rate-setting powers. In response to public clamor largely arising from the popularity of Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, Roosevelt also pushed Congress to enact food safety regulations. Opposition to a meat inspection bill was strongest in the House, due to the presence of conservative Speaker of the House Joseph Gurney Cannon and allies of the meatpacking industry. Roosevelt and Cannon agreed to a compromise bill that became the Meat Inspection Act of 1906. Congress simultaneously passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, which received strong support in both the House and the Senate. Collectively, the laws provided for the labeling of foods and drugs and the inspection of livestock, and mandated sanitary conditions at meatpacking plants.Blum (1954) pp 43‚Äì44 Seeking to bolster antitrust regulations, Roosevelt and his allies introduced a bill to enhance the Sherman Act in 1908, but it was defeated in Congress. In the aftermath of a series of scandals involving major insurance companies, Roosevelt sought to establish a National Bureau of Insurance to provide federal regulation, but this proposal was also defeated.McGerr (2003), pp. 172‚Äì174 Roosevelt continued to launch antitrust suits in his second term, and a suit against Standard Oil in 1906 would lead to that company's break-up in 1911.McGerr (2003), pp. 158‚Äì159 In addition to the antitrust suits and major regulatory reform efforts, the Roosevelt administration also won the cooperation of many large trusts, who consented to regulation by the Bureau of Corporations. Among the companies that voluntarily agreed to regulation was U.S. Steel, which avoided an antitrust suit by allowing the Bureau of Corporations to investigate its operations.Morris (2001) pp. 477‚Äì478 =Conservation= A political cartoon describing Roosevelt as \\"a practical forester\\" Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda.Benjamin Redekop, (2014). \\"Embodying the Story: The Conservation Leadership of Theodore Roosevelt\\" in Leadership DOI: 10.1177/1742715014546875. online Roosevelt's conservation efforts were aimed not just at environment protection, but also at ensuring that society as a whole, rather than just select individuals or companies, benefited from the country's natural resources.Morris (2001) pp 32-33 His key adviser and subordinate on environmental matters was Gifford Pinchot, the head of the Bureau of Forestry. Roosevelt increased Pinchot's power over environmental issues by transferring control over national forests from the Department of the Interior to the Bureau of Forestry, which was part of the Agriculture Department. Pinchot's agency was renamed to the United States Forest Service, and Pinchot presided over the implementation of assertive conservationist policies in national forests. Roosevelt encouraged the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, which promoted federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000 mi¬≤ or 930,000 km¬≤) under federal protection. In 1906, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, granting the president the power to create national monuments in federal lands. Roosevelt set aside more federal land, national parks, and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined.W. Todd Benson, President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservations Legacy (2003)Douglas Brinkley, The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America (2010) Roosevelt established the Inland Waterways Commission to coordinate construction of water projects for both conservation and transportation purposes, and in 1908 he hosted the Conference of Governors to boost support for conservation. After the conference, Roosevelt established the National Conservation Commission to take an inventory of the nation's natural resources.Morris (2001) pp. 515-519 Roosevelt's policies faced opposition from both environmental activists like John Muir and opponents of conservation like Senator Henry M. Teller of Colorado.McGerr (2003), pp. 166‚Äì167 While Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, \\"to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees.\\" Gifford Pinchot, Breaking New Ground, (1947) p. 32. Teller and other opponents of conservation, meanwhile, believed that conservation would prevent the economic development of the West and feared the centralization of power in Washington. The backlash to Roosevelt's ambitious policies prevented further conservation efforts in the final years of Roosevelt's presidency and would later contribute to the Pinchot‚ÄìBallinger controversy during the Taft administration.McGerr (2003), pp. 167‚Äì169 =Labor relations= Charles Lederer Roosevelt was generally reluctant to involve himself in labor- management disputes, but he believed that presidential intervention was justified when such disputes threatened the public interest.Morris (2001) p. 131 Labor union membership had doubled in the five years preceding Roosevelt's inauguration, and at the time of his accession, Roosevelt saw labor unrest as the greatest potential threat facing the nation. Yet he also sympathized with many laborers due to the harsh conditions that many faced.Morris (2001) pp 31‚Äì32 Resisting the more extensive reforms proposed by labor leaders such as Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), Roosevelt established the open shop as the official policy civil service employees.Morris (2001) pp 271‚Äì272 In 1899, the United Mine Workers (UMW) had expanded its influence from bituminous coal mines to anthracite coal mines. The UMW organized an anthracite coal strike in May 1902, seeking an eight-hour day and pay increases. Hoping to reach a negotiated solution with the help of Mark Hanna's National Civic Federation, UMW president John Mitchell prevented bituminous coal miners from launching a sympathy strike. The mine owners, who wanted to crush the UMW, refused to negotiate, and the strike continued. In the ensuing months, the price of coal increased from five dollars per ton to above fifteen dollars per ton. Seeking to help the two parties arrive at a solution, Roosevelt hosted the UMW leaders and mine operators at the White House in October 1902, but the mine owners refused to negotiate. Through the efforts of Roosevelt, Root, and J.P. Morgan, the mine operators agreed to the establishment of a presidential commission to propose a solution to the strike. In March 1903, the commission mandated pay increases and a reduction in the workday from ten hours to nine hours. At the insistence of the mine owners, the UMW was not granted official recognition as the representative of the miners.McGerr (2003), pp. 118‚Äì125 Roosevelt refrained from major interventions in labor disputes after 1902, but state and federal courts increasingly became involved, issuing injunctions to prevent labor actions.McGerr (2003), pp. 143‚Äì144 Tensions were particularly high in Colorado, where the Western Federation of Miners led a series of strikes that became part of a struggle known as the Colorado Labor Wars. Roosevelt did not intervene in the Colorado Labor Wars, but Governor James Hamilton Peabody dispatched the Colorado National Guard to crush the strikes. In 1905, radical union leaders like Mary Harris Jones and Eugene V. Debs established the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which criticized the conciliatory policies of the AFL.McGerr (2003), pp. 126, 138‚Äì142 =Civil rights= Although Roosevelt did some work improving race relations, he, like most leaders of the Progressive Era, lacked initiative on most racial issues. Booker T. Washington, the most important black leader of the day, was the first African American to be invited to dinner at the White House, dining there on October 16, 1901. Washington, who had emerged as an important adviser to Republican politicians in the 1890s, favored accommodation with the Jim Crow laws that instituted racial segregation.McGerr (2003), pp. 198‚Äì200 News of the dinner reached the press two days later, and public outcry from whites was so strong, especially from the Southern states, that Roosevelt never repeated the experiment.Brands, TR (1999) pp 421‚Äì426 Nonetheless, Roosevelt continued to consult Washington regarding appointments and shunned the \\"lily- white\\" Southern Republicans who favored excluding blacks from office. After the dinner with Washington, Roosevelt continued to speak out against lynchings, but did little to advance the cause of African-American civil rights.Morris (2001) pp. 455, 472 In 1906, he approved the dishonorable discharges of three companies of black soldiers who all refused his direct order to testify regarding their actions during a violent episode in Brownsville, Texas, known as the Brownsville Raid. Roosevelt was widely criticized by contemporary newspapers for the discharges, and Senator Joseph B. Foraker won passage of a congressional resolution directing the administration to turn over all documents related to the case.Morris (2001) pp. 471‚Äì473 The controversy hung over the remainder of his presidency, although the Senate eventually concluded that the dismissals had been justified.Morris (2001) p. 511 =Panic of 1907= In 1907, Roosevelt faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893. The U.S. stock market entered a slump in early 1907, and many in the financial markets blamed Roosevelt's regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices.Morris (2001) pp. 495‚Äì496 Lacking a strong central banking system, the government was unable to coordinate a response to the economic downturn. The slump reached a full- blown panic in October 1907, when two investors failed to take over United Copper. Working with Secretary of the Treasury Cortelyou, financier J.P. Morgan organized a group of businessmen to avert a crash by pledging their own money. Roosevelt aided Morgan's intervention by allowing U.S. Steel to acquire the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company despite antitrust concerns, and by authorizing Cortelyou to raise bonds and commit federal funds to the banks.Morris (2001) pp. 497‚Äì501 Roosevelt's reputation in Wall Street fell to new lows following the panic, but the president remained broadly popular.Morris (2001) pp. 501, 504‚Äì505 In the aftermath of the panic, most congressional leaders agreed on the need to reform the nation's financial system. With the support of Roosevelt, Senator Aldrich introduced a bill to allow National Banks to issue emergency currency, but his proposal was defeated by Democrats and progressive Republicans who believed that it was overly favorable to Wall Street. Congress instead passed the Aldrich‚ÄìVreeland Act, which created the National Monetary Commission to study the nation's banking system; the commission's recommendations would later form the basis of the Federal Reserve System. =Tariffs= Many Republicans viewed the tariff as the key plank of their economic policy in the aftermath of the Panic of 1893. The tariff protected domestic manufacturing against foreign competition, and was also a major source of government funding, constituting over one-third of federal revenue in 1901. McKinley had been a committed protectionist, and the Dingley Tariff of 1897 represented a major increase in tariff rates. McKinley also negotiated bilateral reciprocity treaties with France, Argentina, and other countries in an attempt to expand foreign trade while still keeping overall tariff rates high. Unlike McKinley and other nineteenth- century Republican presidents, Roosevelt had never been a strong advocate of the protective tariff, nor did he place a high emphasis on tariffs in general. When Roosevelt took office, McKinley's reciprocity treaties were pending before the Senate, and many assumed that they would be ratified despite the opposition of Aldrich and other conservatives. After conferring with Aldrich, Roosevelt decided not to push Senate ratification of the treaties in order to avoid an intra-party conflict. He did, however, successfully pressure Congress to ratify reciprocal tariff treaties with the Philippines and, after overcoming domestic sugar interests, with Cuba. The issue of the tariff lay dormant throughout Roosevelt's first term, but it continued to be an important campaign topic for both parties. Proponents of tariff reduction asked Roosevelt to call a special session of Congress to address the issue in early 1905, but Roosevelt was only willing to issue a cautious endorsement of a cut in tariff rates, and no further action was taken on the tariff during Roosevelt's tenure. In the first decade of the 20th century, the country experienced a period of sustained inflation for the first time since the early 1870s, and Democrats and other free trade advocates blamed rising prices on high tariff rates. Tariff reduction became an increasingly important national issue, and Congress would pass a major tariff law in 1909, shortly after Roosevelt left office. =Move to Left Center, 1907‚Äì09= In his waning days in office, Roosevelt proposed numerous reforms. By 1907, Roosevelt identified himself with the \\"left center\\" of the Republican Party.In December 1907 he wrote his British friend Arthur Hamilton Lee. \\"To use the terminology of Continental politics, I am trying to keep the left center together.\\" Elting E. Morrison, ed., The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt (1952) vol 6 p 875.See Nathan Miller, Theodore Roosevelt: A Life (1992) chapter 21, \\"'To Keep the Left Center Together'\\" pp 463-82, covering the last two years of his presidency. He explained his balancing act: :Again and again in my public career I have had to make head against mob spirit, against the tendency of poor, ignorant and turbulent people who feel a rancorous jealousy and hatred of those who are better off. But during the last few years it has been the wealthy corruptionists of enormous fortune, and of enormous influence through their agents of the press, pulpit, colleges and public life, with whom I've had to wage bitter war.\\"Roosevelt to Arthur Hamilton Lee, December 16, 1907, in Morrison, ed., The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt (1952) vol 6 p 874. Growing popular outrage at corporate scandals, along with reporting of muckraking journalists like Lincoln Steffens and Ida Tarbell, contributed to a split in the Republican Party between conservatives like Aldrich and progressives like Albert B. Cummins and Robert M. La Follette. Roosevelt did not fully embrace the left wing of his party, but he adopted many of their proposals. In his last two years in office, Roosevelt abandoned his cautious approach toward big business, lambasting his conservative critics and calling on Congress to enact a series of radical new laws.Miller, pp 463-82.Gary Murphy, \\"Theodore Roosevelt, Presidential Power and the Regulation of the Market\\" in Serge Ricard, ed. A companion to Theodore Roosevelt (2011) pp 154‚Äì172. Roosevelt sought to replace the laissez-faire economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government. He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and unjust, economic rewards. Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicalism or fall to revolution.Morris (2001) pp. 430‚Äì431, 436 In January 1908, Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress, calling for the restoration of an employer's liability law, which had recently been struck down by the Supreme Court due to its application to intrastate corporations.Morris (2001) pp. 505‚Äì507 He also called for a national incorporation law (all corporations had state charters, which varied greatly state by state), a federal income tax and inheritance tax (both targeted at the rich), limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes (injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business), an eight-hour work day for federal employees, a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and legislation barring corporations from contributing to political campaigns.Brands, TR (1997) ch 21 Roosevelt's increasingly radical stance proved popular in the Midwest and Pacific Coast, and among farmers, teachers, clergymen, clerical workers and some proprietors, but appeared as divisive and unnecessary to eastern Republicans, corporate executives, lawyers, party workers, and many members of Congress.Mowry (1954) Populist Democrats such as William Jennings Bryan expressed admiration for Roosevelt's message, and one Southern newspaper called for Roosevelt to run as a Democrat in 1908, with Bryan as his running mate.Morris (2001) pp. 508-509 Despite the public support offered by Democratic congressional leaders like John Sharp Williams, Roosevelt never seriously considered leaving the Republican Party during his presidency. Roosevelt's move to the left was supported by some congressional Republicans and many in the public, but conservative Republicans such as Senator Nelson Aldrich and Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon remained in control of Congress.Morris (2001) pp. 510‚Äì511 These Republican leaders blocked the more ambitious aspects of Roosevelt's agenda,Brands, TR (1997) ch 27 though Roosevelt won passage of a new Federal Employers Liability Act and other laws, such as a restriction of child labor in Washington, D.C. =States admitted= One new state, Oklahoma, was admitted to the Union while Roosevelt was in office. Oklahoma, which was formed out of Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory, became the 46th state on November 16, 1907. Congress had established the Indian Territory after several Native American tribes had been relocated to the area following the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Congress had created Oklahoma Territory in 1890 out of a portion of Indian Territory, opening up the region to settlement by whites. Native American leaders in the Indian Territory sought to create the State of Sequoyah, but their efforts were defeated in Congress. At Roosevelt's suggestion, Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory were combined to form one state under the Oklahoma Enabling Act. The act also contained provisions encouraging New Mexico Territory and Arizona Territory to begin the process of gaining admission as states. Foreign policy =Big Stick diplomacy= Roosevelt was good at coining phrases to concisely summarize his policies. \\"Big stick\\" was his catch phrase for his hard pushing foreign policy: \\"Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.\\" Roosevelt described his style as \\"the exercise of intelligent forethought and of decisive action sufficiently far in advance of any likely crisis.\\" As practiced by Roosevelt, big stick diplomacy had five components. First it was essential to possess serious military capabilities that force the adversary to pay close attention. At the time that meant a world-class navy. Roosevelt never had a large army at his disposal. The other qualities were to act justly toward other nations, never to bluff, to strike only if prepared to strike hard, and the willingness to allow the adversary to save face in defeat. =Great power politics= Victory in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War had made the United States a power in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and Roosevelt was determined to continue the expansion of U.S. influence. Reflecting this view, Roosevelt stated in 1905, \\"We have become a great nation, forced by the face of its greatness into relations with the other nations of the earth, and we must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities.\\" Roosevelt believed that the United States had a duty to uphold a balance of power in international relations and seek to reduce tensions among the great powers. He was also adamant in upholding the Monroe Doctrine, the American policy of opposing European colonialism in the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt viewed the German Empire as the biggest potential threat to the United States, and he feared that the Germans would attempt to establish a base in the Caribbean Sea. Given this fear, Roosevelt pursued closer relations with Britain, a rival of Germany, and responded skeptically to German Kaiser Wilhelm II's efforts to curry favor with the United States. Roosevelt also attempted to expand U.S. influence in East Asia and the Pacific, where the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire exercised considerable authority. One important aspect of Roosevelt's strategy in East Asia was the Open Door Policy, which called for keeping China open to trade from all countries. A major turning point in establishing America's role in European affairs was the Moroccan crisis of 1905‚Äì1906. France and Britain had agreed that France would dominate Morocco, but Germany suddenly protested aggressively, with the disregard for quiet diplomacy characteristic of Kaiser Wilhelm. Berlin asked Roosevelt to serve as an intermediary, and he helped arrange a multinational conference at Algeciras, Morocco, where the crisis was resolved. Roosevelt advised Europeans in the future the United States would probably avoid any involvement in Europe, even as a mediator, so European foreign ministers stopped including the United States as a potential factor in the European balance of power.Ernest R. May, From Imperialism to Isolationism 1898-1919 (1964) pp 29-30.Howard K. Beale, Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power (1955) pp 355-89. =Aftermath of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= The United States and its colonial possessions when Roosevelt entered office  Philippines Roosevelt inherited a country torn by debate over the territories acquired in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Roosevelt believed that Cuba should be quickly granted independence and that Puerto Rico should remain a semi-autonomous possession under the terms of the Foraker Act. He wanted U.S. forces to remain in the Philippines to establish a stable, democratic government, even in the face of an insurrection led by Emilio Aguinaldo. Roosevelt feared that a quick U.S. withdrawal would lead to instability in the Philippines or an intervention by a major power such as Germany or Japan.Morris (2001) pp 24-25 The Filipino insurrection largely ended with the capture of Miguel Malvar in 1902.Morris (2001) pp 100-101 In remote Southern areas, the Muslim Moros resisted American rule in an ongoing conflict known as the Moro Rebellion,Federico V. Magdalena, \\"Moro-American Relations in the Philippines.\\" Philippine Studies 44.3 (1996): 427-438. online but elsewhere the insurgents came to accept American rule. Roosevelt continued the McKinley policies of removing the Catholic friars (with compensation to the Pope), upgrading the infrastructure, introducing public health programs, and launching a program of economic and social modernization. The enthusiasm shown in 1898-99 for colonies cooled off, and Roosevelt saw the islands as \\"our heel of Achilles.\\" He told Taft in 1907, \\"I should be glad to see the islands made independent, with perhaps some kind of international guarantee for the preservation of order, or with some warning on our part that if they did not keep order we would have to interfere again.\\"H. W. Brands, Bound to Empire: The United States and the Philippines. (1992) p. 84. By then the president and his foreign policy advisers turned away from Asian issues to concentrate on Latin America, and Roosevelt redirected Philippine policy to prepare the islands to become the first Western colony in Asia to achieve self- government.Stephen Wertheim, \\"Reluctant Liberator: Theodore Roosevelt's Philosophy of Self-Government and Preparation for Philippine Independence,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly, Sept 2009, Vol. 39 Issue 3, pp 494‚Äì518 Though most Filipino leaders favored independence, some minority groups, especially the Chinese who controlled much of local business, wanted to stay under American rule indefinitely.Ellen H. Palanca, \\"Chinese business families in the Philippines since the 1890s.\\" in R.S. Brown, Chinese business enterprise in Asia (1995). The Philippines was a major target for the progressive reformers. A report to Secretary of War Taft provided a summary of what the American civil administration had achieved. It included, in addition to the rapid building of a public school system based on English teaching: :steel and concrete wharves at the newly renovated Port of Manila; dredging the River Pasig,; streamlining of the Insular Government; accurate, intelligible accounting; the construction of a telegraph and cable communications network; the establishment of a postal savings bank; large-scale road-and bridge- building; impartial and incorrupt policing; well-financed civil engineering; the conservation of old Spanish architecture; large public parks; a bidding process for the right to build railways; Corporation law; and a coastal and geological survey.Andrew Roberts, A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 (2008), p 26. Cuba While the Philippines would remain under U.S. control until 1946, Cuba gained independence in 1902.Morris (2001) pp 105‚Äì106 The Platt Amendment, passed during the final year of McKinley's tenure, made Cuba a de facto protectorate of the United States.Morris (2001) p. 456 Roosevelt won congressional approval for a reciprocity agreement with Cuba in December 1902, thereby lowering tariffs on trade between the two countries.Morris (2001) p. 299 In 1906, an insurrection erupted against Cuban President Tom√°s Estrada Palma due to the latter's alleged electoral fraud. Both Estrada Palma and his liberal opponents called for an intervention by the U.S., but Roosevelt was reluctant to intervene.Morris (2001) pp. 456‚Äì457 When Estrada Palma and his Cabinet resigned, Secretary of War Taft declared that the U.S. would intervene under the terms of the Platt Amendment, beginning the Second Occupation of Cuba.Morris (2001) pp. 461‚Äì462 U.S. forces restored peace to the island, and the occupation ceased shortly before the end of Roosevelt's presidency.Morris (2001) p. 554 Puerto Rico Puerto Rico had been something of an afterthought during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but it assumed importance due to its strategic position in the Caribbean Sea. The island provided an ideal naval base for defense of the Panama Canal, and it also served as an economic and political link to the rest of Latin America. Prevailing racist attitudes made Puerto Rican statehood unlikely, so the U.S. carved out a new political status for the island. The Foraker Act and subsequent Supreme Court cases established Puerto Rico as the first unincorporated territory, meaning that the United States Constitution would not fully apply to Puerto Rico. Though the U.S. imposed tariffs on most Puerto Rican imports, it also invested in the island's infrastructure and education system. Nationalist sentiment remained strong on the island and Puerto Ricans continued to primarily speak Spanish rather than English.Herring, pp. 364-365 =Military reforms= 1904 commentary on Roosevelt's \\"big stick\\" policy in the Caribbean Roosevelt placed an emphasis on expanding and reforming the United States military. The United States Army, with 39,000 men in 1890, was the smallest and least powerful army of any major power in the late 19th century. By contrast, France's army consisted of 542,000 soldiers.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (1987) p. 154, 203 The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War had been fought mostly by temporary volunteers and state national guard units, and it demonstrated that more effective control over the department and bureaus was necessary.Graham A. Cosmas, An Army for Empire: The United States Army and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1971) Roosevelt gave strong support to the reforms proposed by Secretary of War Elihu Root, who wanted a uniformed chief of staff as general manager and a European-style general staff for planning. Overcoming opposition from General Nelson A. Miles, the Commanding General of the United States Army, Root succeeded in enlarging West Point and establishing the U.S. Army War College as well as the general staff. Root also changed the procedures for promotions, organized schools for the special branches of the service, devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line,James E. Hewes, Jr. From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and Administration, 1900-1963 (1975) and increased the Army's connections to the National Guard. Upon taking office, Roosevelt made naval expansion a priority, and his tenure saw an increase in the number of ships, officers, and enlisted men in the Navy. With the publication of The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660‚Äì1783 in 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan had been immediately hailed as an outstanding naval theorist by the leaders of Europe. Roosevelt paid very close attention to Mahan's emphasis that only a nation with a powerful fleet could dominate the world's oceans, exert its diplomacy to the fullest, and defend its own borders.Peter Karsten, \\"The Nature of 'Influence': Roosevelt, Mahan and the Concept of Sea Power.\\" American Quarterly 23#4 (1971): 585-600. in JSTORRichard W. Turk, The Ambiguous Relationship: Theodore Roosevelt and Alfred Thayer Mahan (1987) online By 1904, the United States had the fifth largest navy in the world, and by 1907, it had the third largest. Roosevelt sent what he dubbed the \\"Great White Fleet\\" around the globe in 1908‚Äì1909 to make sure all the naval powers understood the United States was now a major player. Though Roosevelt's fleet did not match the overall strength of the British fleet, it became the dominant naval force in the Western Hemisphere.Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \\"The Global Strategist: The Navy as the Nation's Big Stick,\\" in Serge Ricard, ed., A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt (2011) pp 257‚Äì273Stephen G. Rabe, \\"Theodore Roosevelt, the Panama Canal, and the Roosevelt Corollary: Sphere of Influence Diplomacy,\\" in Ricard, ed., A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt (2011) pp 274-92.Gordon Carpenter O'Gara, Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of the Modern Navy (1970) =Rapprochement with Great Britain= Varying claims in Southeast Alaska before arbitration in 1903. The Great Rapprochement between Britain and the United States had begun with British support of the United States during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and it continued as Britain withdrew its fleet from the Caribbean in favor of focusing on the rising German naval threat. Roosevelt sought a continuation of close relations with Britain in order to ensure peaceful, shared hegemony over the Western hemisphere. With the British acceptance of the Monroe Doctrine and American acceptance of the British control of Canada, only two potential major issues remained between the U.S. and Britain: the Alaska boundary dispute and construction of a canal across Central America. Under McKinley, Secretary of State Hay had negotiated the Hay‚ÄìPauncefote Treaty, in which the British consented to U.S. construction of the canal. Roosevelt won Senate ratification of the treaty in December 1901.Morris (2001) pp 25‚Äì26 The boundary between Alaska and Canada had become an issue in the late 1890s due to the Klondike Gold Rush, as American and Canadian prospectors in Yukon and Alaska competed for gold claims. A treaty on the border between Alaska and Canada had been reached by Britain and Russia in the 1825 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, and the United States had assumed Russian claims on the region through the 1867 Alaska Purchase. The United States argued that the treaty had given Alaska sovereignty over disputed territories which included the gold rush boom towns of Dyea and Skagway. The Venezuela Crisis briefly threatened to disrupt peaceful negotiations over the border, but conciliatory actions by the British during the crisis helped defuse any possibility of broader hostilities. In January 1903, the U.S. and Britain reached the Hay‚ÄìHerbert Treaty, which would empower a six-member tribunal, composed of American, British, and Canadian delegates, to set the border between Alaska and Canada. With the help of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Roosevelt won the Senate's consent to the Hay‚ÄìHerbert Treaty in February 1903. The tribunal consisted of three American delegates, two Canadian delegates, and Lord Alverstone, the lone delegate from Britain itself. Alverstone joined with the three American delegates in accepting most American claims, and the tribunal announced its decision in October 1903. The outcome of the tribunal strengthened relations between the United States and Britain, though many Canadians were outraged by the tribunal's decision. =Venezuela Crisis and Roosevelt Corollary= In December 1902, an Anglo-German blockade of Venezuela began an incident known as the Venezuelan Crisis. The blockade originated due to money owed by Venezuela to European creditors. Both powers assured the U.S. that they were not interested in conquering Venezuela, and Roosevelt sympathized with the European creditors, but he became suspicious that Germany would demand territorial indemnification from Venezuela. Roosevelt and Hay feared that even an allegedly temporary occupation could lead to a permanent German military presence in the Western Hemisphere. As the blockade began, Roosevelt mobilized the U.S. fleet under the command of Admiral George Dewey.Morris (2001) pp. 176‚Äì182 Roosevelt threatened to destroy the German fleet unless the Germans agreed to arbitration regarding the Venezuelan debt, and Germany chose arbitration rather than war.Morris (2001) pp. 187‚Äì191 Through American arbitration, Venezuela reached a settlement with Germany and Britain in February 1903. TR used his navy to dominate the Caribbean; 1904 cartoon by William Allen Rogers Though Roosevelt would not tolerate European territorial ambitions in Latin America, he also believed that Latin American countries should pay the debts they owed to European credits.Morris (2001) p. 201 In late 1904, Roosevelt announced his Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. It stated that the U.S. would intervene in the finances of unstable Caribbean and Central American countries if they defaulted on their debts to European creditors and, in effect, guarantee their debts, making it unnecessary for European powers to intervene to collect unpaid debts. Roosevelt's pronouncement was especially meant as a warning to Germany, and had the result of promoting peace in the region, as the Germans decided to not intervene directly in Venezuela and in other countries.Frederick W. Marks III, Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt (1979), p. 140 A crisis in the Dominican Republic became the first test case for the Roosevelt Corollary. Deeply in debt, the nation struggled to repay its European creditors. Fearing another intervention by Germany and Britain, Roosevelt reached an agreement with Dominican President Carlos Felipe Morales to take temporary control of the Dominican economy, much as the U.S. had done on a permanent basis in Puerto Rico. The U.S. took control of the Dominican customs house, brought in economists such as Jacob Hollander to restructure the economy, and ensured a steady flow of revenue to the Dominican Republic's foreign creditors. The intervention stabilized the political and economic situation in the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. role on the island would serve as a model for Taft's dollar diplomacy in the years after Roosevelt left office.Herring, pp. 371‚Äì372 =Panama Canal= Roosevelt regarded the Panama Canal as one of his greatest achievements Roosevelt at the controls of a steam shovel excavating Culebra Cut for the Panama Canal, 1906 Roosevelt sought the creation of a canal through Central America which would link the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Most members of Congress preferred that the canal cross through Nicaragua, which was eager to reach an agreement, but Roosevelt preferred the isthmus of Panama, under the loose control of Colombia. Colombia had been engulfed in a civil war since 1898, and a previous attempt to build a canal across Panama had failed under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps. A presidential commission appointed by McKinley had recommended the construction of the canal across Nicaragua, but it noted that a canal across Panama could prove less expensive and might be completed more quickly.Morris (2001) pp. 26, 67‚Äì68 Roosevelt and most of his advisers favored the Panama Canal, as they believed that war with a European power, possibly Germany, could soon break out over the Monroe Doctrine and the U.S. fleet would remain divided between the two oceans until the canal was completed.Morris (2001) pp. 201‚Äì202 After a long debate, Congress passed the Spooner Act of 1902, which granted Roosevelt $170 million to build the Panama Canal.Morris (2001) pp. 115‚Äì116 Following the passage of the Spooner Act, the Roosevelt administration began negotiations with the Colombian government regarding the construction of a canal through Panama. The U.S. and Colombia signed the Hay‚ÄìHerr√°n Treaty in January 1903, granting the U.S. a lease across the isthmus of Panama. The Colombian Senate refused to ratify the treaty, and attached amendments calling for more money from the U.S. and greater Colombian control over the canal zone.Morris (2001) pp. 262‚Äì263 Panamanian rebel leaders, long eager to break off from Colombia, appealed to the United States for military aid.Morris (2001) pp. 276‚Äì278 Roosevelt saw the leader of Colombia, Jos√© Manuel Marroqu√≠n, as a corrupt and irresponsible autocrat, and he believed that the Colombians had acted in bad faith by reaching and then rejecting the treaty. After an insurrection broke out in Panama, Roosevelt dispatched the USS Nashville to prevent the Colombian government from landing soldiers in Panama, and Colombia was unable to re- establish control over the province.Morris (2001) pp. 282‚Äì283 Shortly after Panama declared its independence in November 1903, the U.S. recognized Panama as an independent nation and began negotiations regarding construction of the canal. According to Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, most other Latin American nations welcomed the prospect of the new canal in hopes of increased economic activity, but anti-imperialists in the U.S. raged against Roosevelt's aid to the Panamanian separatists.Morris (2001) pp. 293‚Äì298 Secretary of State Hay and French diplomat Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, who represented the Panamanian government, quickly negotiated the Hay‚ÄìBunau-Varilla Treaty. Signed on November 18, 1903, it established the Panama Canal Zone‚Äîover which the United States would exercise sovereignty‚Äîand insured the construction of an Atlantic to Pacific ship canal across the Isthmus of Panama. Panama sold the Canal Zone (consisting of the Panama Canal and an area generally extending on each side of the centerline) to the United States for $10 million and a steadily increasing yearly sum.Julie Greene, The Canal Builders: Making America's Empire at the Panama Canal (2009) In February 1904, Roosevelt won Senate ratification of the treaty in a 66-to-14 vote.Morris (2001) pp. 297‚Äì303, 312 The Isthmian Canal Commission, supervised by Secretary of War Taft, was established to govern the zone and oversee the construction of the canal.Morris (2001) pp. 320‚Äì321 Roosevelt appointed George Whitefield Davis as the first governor of the Panama Canal Zone and John Findley Wallace as the Chief Engineer of the canal project. When Wallace resigned in 1905, Roosevelt appointed John Frank Stevens, who built a railroad in the canal zone and initiated the construction of a lock canal. Stevens was replaced in 1907 by George Washington Goethals, who saw construction through to its completion. Roosevelt traveled to Panama in November 1906 to inspect progress on the canal, becoming the first sitting president to travel outside of the United States. =East Asia= Russo-Japanese War Russia had occupied the Chinese region of Manchuria in the aftermath of the 1900 Boxer Rebellion, and the United States, Japan, and Britain all sought the end of its military presence in the region. Russia agreed to withdrawal its forces in 1902, but it reneged on this promise and sought to expand its influence in Manchuria to the detriment of the other powers. Roosevelt was unwilling to consider using the military to intervene in the far-flung region, but Japan prepared for war against Russia in order to remove it from Manchuria. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904, Roosevelt sympathized with the Japanese but sought to act as a mediator in the conflict. He hoped to uphold the Open Door policy in China and prevent either country from emerging as the dominant power in East Asia. Throughout 1904, both Japan and Russia expected to win the war, but the Japanese gained a decisive advantage after capturing the Russian naval base at Port Arthur in January 1905. In mid-1905, Roosevelt persuaded the parties to meet in a peace conference in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, starting on August 5. His persistent and effective mediation led to the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth on September 5, ending the war. For his efforts, Roosevelt was awarded the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize.Greg Russell, \\"Theodore Roosevelt's Diplomacy and the Quest for Great Power Equilibrium in Asia,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 2008 38(3): 433-455 The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted in the removal of Russian troops from Manchuria, and it gave Japan control of Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin Island. Relations with Japan Roosevelt saw Japan as the rising power in Asia, in terms of military strength and economic modernization. He viewed Korea as a backward nation and did not object to Japan's attempt to gain control over Korea. With the withdrawal of the American legation from Seoul and the refusal of the Secretary of State to receive a Korean protest mission, the Americans signaled they would not intervene militarily to stop Japan's planned takeover of Korea.Howard K. Beale, Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power (1956) In mid-1905, Taft and Japanese Prime Minister Katsura Tar≈ç jointly produced the Taft‚ÄìKatsura agreement.

Instead, the two countries, led by Secretary of State Elihu Root and Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Tadasu, reached the informal Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907. The agreement banned emigration of Japanese laborers to the U.S. and Hawaii, while also ending the segregation order of the San Francisco School Board, which had humiliated and angered the Japanese. The agreements remained in effect until the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, in which Congress forbade all immigration from Japan.Carl R. Weinberg, \\"The 'Gentlemen's Agreement' of 1907‚Äì08,\\" OAH Magazine of History (2009) 23#4 pp 36‚Äì36.A. Whitney Griswold, The Far Eastern Policy of the United States (1938). pp 354‚Äì60, 372‚Äì79 Despite the agreement, tensions with Japan would continue to simmer due to the treatment of Japanese immigrants by local governments in the United States. Roosevelt never feared imminent war with the Japanese during his tenure, but the friction with Japan encouraged further naval build-up and an increased focus on the security of the American position in the Pacific.Morris (2001) pp. 493‚Äì494 =Algeciras Conference= In 1906, at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Roosevelt convinced France to attend the Algeciras Conference as part of an effort to resolve the First Moroccan Crisis. After signing the Entente Cordiale with Britain, France had sought to assert its dominance over Morocco, and a crisis had begun after Germany protested this move. By asking Roosevelt to convene an international conference on Morocco, Kaiser Wilhelm II sought to test the new Anglo-British alliance, check French expansion, and potentially draw the United States into an alliance against France and Britain. Senator Augustus Octavius Bacon protested U.S. involvement in European affairs, but Secretary of State Root and administration allies like Senator Lodge helped defeat Bacon's resolution condemning U.S. participation in the Algeciras Conference. The conference was held in the city of Algeciras, Spain, and 13 nations attended. The key issue was control of the police forces in the Moroccan cities, and Germany, with a weak diplomatic delegation, found itself in a decided minority. Hoping to avoid an expansion of German power in North Africa, Roosevelt secretly supported France, and he cooperated closely with the French ambassador. An agreement among the powers, reached on April 7, 1906, slightly reduced French influence by reaffirming the independence of the Sultan of Morocco and the economic independence and freedom of operations of all European powers within the country. Germany gained nothing of importance but was mollified and stopped threatening war.Raymond A. Esthus, Theodore Roosevelt and the International Rivalries (1970) pp 66‚Äì111 Elections =Election of 1904= 1904 electoral college results Before and during his presidency, Roosevelt built up a strong following within the Republican Party, but his re-nomination in 1904 was far from certain at the end of 1901. Many expected Senator Mark Hanna, a confidante of former President McKinley, to win the party's 1904 presidential nomination.Morris (2001) pp 95‚Äì96 Support for Hanna was especially strong among conservative businessmen who opposed many of Roosevelt's policies,Morris (2001) pp 299‚Äì300 though Hanna lacked his own national organization, and even in his home state he was opposed by influential Senator Joseph Foraker. Hanna and another prominent party leader, Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania, both died in 1904. Other potential rivals for the 1904 Republican presidential nomination, including Leslie Shaw and Charles W. Fairbanks, failed to galvanize support for their candidacies. At the 1904 Republican National Convention, Roosevelt secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, Robert R. Hitt, was not nominated. Senator Fairbanks, a favorite of conservatives, gained the vice-presidential nomination. The Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 1904 was Alton B. Parker, the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals. Democratic leaders hoped that Parker, whose political positions were largely unknown, would be able unify the populist followers of William Jennings Bryan with the conservative supporters of former President Grover Cleveland. Parker was unable to unite the party, and many Democrats supported Roosevelt.Morris (2001) pp. 339‚Äì340 Democrats alleged that the Republican campaign extorted large contributions from corporations, but these allegations had little impact on the election. As Parker moved his party in a conservative direction, Republicans performed well among progressives and centrists. Roosevelt won 56% of the popular vote while Parker received 38% of the popular; Roosevelt also won the electoral vote 336 to 140. Roosevelt's victory made him first president to be elected to a full term of his own after having succeeded to the presidency upon the death of a predecessor. His popular vote margin of 18.8% was the largest margin in U.S. history until the 1920 presidential election. On election night, as it became clear that he had won in a landslide, Roosevelt pledged not to run for a third term. =Election of 1908 and transition= Republican William Howard Taft defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 election Roosevelt had mixed feelings about a third term, as he enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful, but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship. Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term, and he threw his support behind a successor so as to avoid a potential pro-Roosevelt delegate stampede at the 1908 Republican National Convention. Roosevelt personally favored Secretary of State Elihu Root, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes loomed as a potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies. Many conservatives wanted to re-take leadership of the party from the progressive Roosevelt. Senator Joseph Foraker, who like Taft was from Ohio, briefly emerged as the main conservative candidate for the GOP nomination.Morris (2001) pp. 506‚Äì507 However, Taft defeated Foraker's attempt to win control of the Ohio Republican Party and entered the convention as the strong favorite over Foraker, Hughes, and Senator Philander Knox.Morris (2001) p. 520 At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for \\"four years more\\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Roosevelt's close friend, Henry Cabot Lodge, made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term. In a speech accepting the Republican nomination, Taft promised to continue the policies of Roosevelt, but as the campaign progressed he minimized his reliance on Roosevelt, and did not ask the president to publicly campaign for him.Morris (2001) pp. 533-536 The Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan, who had been the party's presidential candidate in 1896 and 1900. Bryan, a populist Democrat widely regarded as a strong speaker, thought that Taft was a weak candidate and hoped that the public would tire of the Republican leadership the country had experienced since the 1896 election.Morris (2001) pp. 528‚Äì529 The platforms of the two parties differed little: both called for antitrust actions, railroad and labor regulations, and a revision of the tariff.Morris (2001) pp. 534‚Äì535 As election day approached, it became clear that Taft would retain the loyalty of Republican voters and win a wide victory over Bryan, who had failed to find a winning issue on which to campaign. Taft won 321 of the 483 electoral votes and 51.6% of the popular vote. Republicans also retained control of both houses of Congress. Roosevelt regarded the victory of his chosen successor as a vindication of his policies and presidency.Morris (2001) pp. 537‚Äì539 As he left office, Roosevelt was widely regarded as the most powerful and influential president since Abraham Lincoln.Morris (2001) pp. 554‚Äì555 Taft's decision to retain few members of Roosevelt's Cabinet alienated Roosevelt, although Roosevelt continued to support his successor throughout the transition period.Morris (2001) pp. 548‚Äì552 Historical reputation Roosevelt in Pennsylvania on October 26, 1914 Roosevelt was popular as he left office, and he remained a major world figure until his death in 1919. His own contemporaries viewed his presidency as influential; former Senator William E. Chandler wrote in January 1909 that Roosevelt \\"changed the course of American politics. We can never go back to where we were under Hanna.\\" After his death, Roosevelt was overshadowed by other figures, but the interest of historians and the American public in Roosevelt was reinvigorated after World War II. Historian John Morton Blum's 1954 book, The Republican Roosevelt, advanced the thesis that Roosevelt had been the first truly modern president, and many historians have argued that Roosevelt's presidency served as a model to subsequent presidents. Historian Lewis L. Gould summarizes the consensus view of historians, stating that Roosevelt was \\"a strong, effective executive whose policies foreshadowed the welfare state.\\" Gould also writes, \\"if Roosevelt fell short of the first rank of president, he qualified for that ambivalent rating of 'near great,' conferred upon him in the polls that historians take with each other. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association ranked Roosevelt as the fourth greatest president in history, after George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt is a hero to modern liberals for his proposals in 1907‚Äì12 that presaged the modern welfare state of the New Deal Era, and put the environment on the national agenda. Conservatives admire his \\"big stick\\" diplomacy and commitment to military values. Dalton says, \\"Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century and redefined America's place in the world.\\" However, the New Left has criticized him for his interventionist and imperialist approach to nations he considered \\"uncivilized\\". Conservatives reject his vision of the welfare state and emphasis on the superiority of government over private action... Notes References =Works cited= * .  .

The cathedral was Wakefield Cathedral and the bishop was the diocesan Bishop of Wakefield. The Diocese of Wakefield was created out of the Diocese of Ripon in 1888 in response to the rapid expansion in population due to the Industrial Revolution. Immediately prior to its dissolution it extended north to south from the suburbs of Leeds to Barnsley and east to west from Kellington to Todmorden. The diocese was dissolved on 20 April 2014 by the creation of the new Diocese of Leeds.The Transformation Programme ‚Äì First new diocese for more than 85 years created on April 20 (Accessed 19 April 2014) History After discussions in the mid-1870s as to where a new diocese in the West Riding of Yorkshire should be, Wakefield, with a population of under 30,000, was chosen before Leeds and Bradford and Huddersfield and Halifax. Wakefield was then the county town of the West Riding and had a large medieval church. The new Diocese of Wakefield was taken out of the southern part of the Diocese of Ripon, which was formed in 1836 out of the vast Diocese of York, and divided the industrial area of the West Riding separating Wakefield, Huddersfield and Halifax from Leeds and Bradford which remained in Ripon. The diocese was enlarged in 1926 to include the deaneries of Hemsworth and Pontefract from the Diocese of York. As constituted on 18 May 1888, the diocese comprised the archdeaconries of Halifax and Huddersfield. In 1927, the archdeaconries were reorganised into the archdeaconries of Halifax and of Pontefract. The old archdeaconry of Halifax, in the northwest, the deaneries of Birstall, Halifax and Dewsbury, became the archdeaconry of Pontefract, covering the deaneries of Barnsley, Birstal, Dewsbury, Pontefract and Wakefield in the east and the archdeaconry of Huddersfield, which covered the deaneries of Hemworth, Huddersfield, Pontefract, Silkstone and Wakefield, became the new archdeaconry of Halifax, covering the west (the deaneries of Halifax and Huddersfield).

Lang of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech for a large, rapidly growing city in the United States that remains essentially suburban in character, even as it reaches populations more typical of urban core cities. It describes a relatively recent phenomenon in a United States context. Definition Boomburbs are defined as incorporated places in the top 50 Metropolitan areas in the United States of more than 100,000 residents, but that are not the core cities in their metropolitan areas and have maintained double-digit rates of population growth (10% or more) over consecutive censuses between 1970 and 2000.Lang, Robert E. and Arthur C. Nelson. \\"The Boomburb Downtown\\". p.2. Alexandria, Virginia: Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech.

Background and recording According to his then girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham's, account, he wrote the lyrics after an argument with her, using \\"Mary\\" (Etchingham's middle name). In a later interview, Hendrix commented that the lyrics represent \\"more than one person\\". Billy Cox, Hendrix's long-time friend and later bassist, has noted Curtis Mayfield's influence on the song. Hendrix performed elements or an early version in the summer of 1966 with his band Jimmy James and the Blue Flames in New York City. The Experience recorded it at De Lane Lea Studios in London on January 11, 1967, during sessions for their follow-up single to \\"Hey Joe\\". Hendrix producer Chas Chandler commented on the recording: The single, backed by \\"Highway Chile\\", was released in the UK in May 1967 and reached number six on the UK Singles Chart. In the United States, the song was first released as the B-side of the \\"Purple Haze\\" single in June 1967. It was later included on the American Are You Experienced album, released in August 1967.The American album included the three UK experience singles in place of three other songs. Performance Hendrix often performed the song live in 1967 and 1968. A recording from the Monterey Pop Festival was later released on Jimi Plays Monterey (1986) and Live at Monterey (2007); another from the Paris L'Olympia Theatre appeared on Stages (1991), The Jimi Hendrix Experience (2000), and Live in Paris & Ottawa 1968 (2008). Stages also includes a 1967 recording from a Stockholm concert. Impact and legacy Rolling Stone magazine ranked \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" number 379 on its list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\".

Philaretos is attested on seals as taxiarches (commander of an infantry regiment), as well as protospatharios and topoteretes (deputy commander) of the Tagmata of Cappadocia, then as magistros and doux (duke), and finally as kouropalates and doux.  Career  State controlled by Philaretos. Noted for his cruelty and greed, Philaretos held a high command in the army of Romanus IV Diogenes. In 1069 he was given the command of the main Byzantine army that was protecting the frontier of Mesopotamia while Romanus participated in the siege of Akhlat.Finlay, pg. 35 He was defeated by the Seljuk Turks who advanced deep into Cappadocia and Lycaonia and plundered at will before rapidly retreating with their spoils. He was present at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, where he commanded a division of Romanus' army, and remained at the head of a considerable body of troops after the disaster.Finlay, pg. 50 In the aftermath of the battle, he commanded the forces of the fortress Romanopolis, and on Romanus' death he assumed the title of Emperor.Finlay, pg. 50 As the only remaining Byzantine general in the southeast he established a quasi-autonomous realm in the neighbourhood of Germanicia, which stretched from Cilicia to Edessa. The core of his army was composed of 8,000 \\"Franks\\" (Normans) under Raimbaud. In 1078, at the beginning of the rule of Nikephoros III Botaneiates, he agreed to abandon his imperial claims on condition that Botaneiates appoint him as the duke of Antioch, which included Edessa.Finlay, pg. 50 Several seals testify him as megas domestikos and protokouropalates, then sebastos, then even protosebastos. He retained his dukedom until the Turks began to press heavily upon him. In December 1084, he lost Antioch to Suleiman I, Sultan of Rum. In 1087, Edessa fell to Malik Shah and Philaretos escaped back to the fortress of Germanikeia; however, some sources indicate that he died in 1086. He was the last well-known Domestic of the Schools of the East. His sons handed Germanikeia to the First Crusade in 1098.

Plot Adam Dalgliesh is brought in to investigate the mysterious death of a famous writer on a remote and inaccessible island off the Cornish coast. Combe Island is a discreet retreat operated by a private trust, where the rich and powerful find peace and quiet. Famed novelist Nathan Oliver, who was born on the island and thus is allowed to visit as he wishes, arrives with his daughter, Miranda and his copy-editor, Dennis Tremlett, who, unbeknownst to Oliver, are having an affair. When he discovers them, Oliver reacts with fury and orders them to leave the island the next day. Oliver is discovered hanging from the island's historic lighthouse. Dalgliesh and his team arrive to investigate. Surfacing from a fever, Dalgleish has a vision that helps him fit the pieces of the puzzle together. Dalgliesh recovers from his illness, and after the break of the investigation and quarantine, he and his lover Emma both overcome their fears about each other's seeming lack of commitment, and agree to marry. Reception In a 2005 book review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin called the book \\"too rooted in genre conventions to count originality as its strong suit. But it has deviousness to burn, and it also offers other enticements.\\", and wrote \\"[It] is a better book than its predecessor, 'The Murder Room.'

It has been described as \\"an exercise in soul, psychedelic rock, and polyrhythmic jazz-inspired drumming\\" by AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald. The song was remixed in stereo for the American release of the album. In 1969, it was released as a stereo single in the UK with the title \\"Let Me Light Your Fire\\". One of Hendrix's most popular songs, he frequently played it in concert. Several live recordings have been released and the original song is included on numerous Hendrix compilations, such as Smash Hits, Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix, Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection, and Fire: The Jimi Hendrix Collection. Overview Despite its sexual overtones, the song had an innocuous origin. Noel Redding, bass player for the Experience, invited Hendrix to his mother's house on a cold New Year's Eve in Folkestone, England, after a performance. Hendrix asked Noel's mother if he could stand next to her fireplace to warm himself. She agreed, but her Great Dane was in the way, so Hendrix let out with, \\"Aw, move over, Rover, and let Jimi take over\\". Hendrix later joked with the lyric: \\"Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to find her poor dog a bone, but when she bent over Rover took over, 'cause Rover had a bone of his own! Shakespeare, page 35!\\" Red Hot Chili Peppers version The Red Hot Chili Peppers began performing \\"Fire\\" in 1983 and recorded it as a B-side for their 1987 \\"Fight Like a Brave\\" single and a year later released it on The Abbey Road E.P.. The song was also included on their 1989 album, Mother's Milk as a tribute to the band's founding guitarist Hillel Slovak who died in 1988. The Chili Peppers version features lead singer Anthony Kiedis changing some of the lyrics such as \\"Move over, Rover, and let Jimi take over\\" to \\"Move over, Rover, and let Mr. Huckleberry take over\\" for Slovak (who was also known by his nickname, \\"Mr. Huckleberry\\").

He served as president of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad and later the Lehigh Valley Railroad.  Biography  Nash was born in Syracuse, New York, to Roger and Mary Nash. His career began in 1925, at the age of fifteen, when the New York Central Railroad hired him as a freight station clerk in his native Syracuse. He married Ethel Howey in 1931; they had one daughter, Jan Perry. He worked his way up through the New York Central over the next 27 years. He was promoted to traveling car agent in 1941, assistant trainmaster (later trainmaster) in Buffalo, New York in 1942, assistant to the general manager back at Syracuse in 1948, then assistant superintendent in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1950 he became superintendent in Albany, New York; the following year he was made general manager of the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A;), a New York Central subsidiary. Nash was elected vice president of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, another New York Central subsidiary, in July 1952. He was named president in January 1956. Nash was president for just a few months, with John W. Barriger III succeeding him in July. Nash returned to the New York Central as vice president of operations. He was promoted to senior vice president in 1963. Nash departed the New York Central system to become president of the ailing Lehigh Valley Railroad, then controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad, on October 28, 1965. The Lehigh had not been profitable since 1956, and toward the end of the 1960s depended on its owner, first the Pennsylvania and then Penn Central, to keep afloat. It followed the Penn Central into bankruptcy in July 1970. The bankruptcy court appointed Nash and Robert Haldeman as bankruptcy trustees; Nash also held the title of chief operating officer. Nash resigned as co- trustee in August 1974 after a salary dispute with the Interstate Commerce Commission. He took the title of president and chief executive officer until his retirement in January 1975, at the age of 65. After his retirement, Nash moved to Florida and was an active member of the Boca Raton Historical Society. Nash died on August 29, 2004.

Definition The term \\"Aussie Battler\\" generally refers to working class Australians, specifically, those who feel they must work hard at a low paying job to earn enough money,Goodonyamate: A dictionary of Australian Slang is actually well respected by Australian society at large as they stoically face perceived financial hardships, in spite of Australian workers being among some of the highest paid and resourceful in the western world. The concept of an \\"Aussie battler\\" is an example of self-aggrandising language, designed to counter feelings of stigma or inadequacy, and to bolster confidence in being a member of the Australian underclass. It refers to an Australian who continues to struggle in the face of hardship. It is a term of respect and endearment, not simply used to assess someone's financial situation; the ordinary working- man earning a living against the odds. The common variation little Aussie battler further adds to the notion that the battler is at the bottom of society, working under bigger things above. In Australian English, the concept of a \\"battler\\" is a power word similar to the concept of the \\"hardworking family\\". It is used by various political personages and entities for their own purposes. Where in one context a person may use the term to refer to people of low socioeconomic status to call for greater welfare, others may use it to refer to a family saving for a private education to call for government payments to private schools. Middle-class battlers Some individuals are self-defined \\"battlers\\" without fitting the above definition because of their own interpretations of \\"earning enough money.\\" Social scientist and author Michael Pusey has described this as \\"Middle Class Battler syndrome\\" because these \\"battlers\\" earn more than the average wage but see expensive homes and consumer goods as necessities. As a result, they have very little disposable income after servicing debts for these items. Despite the self-inflicted hardship, the myth of the \\"battler\\" remains. Use in political rhetoric Following the election of the conservative coalition government under the leadership of John Howard in 1996, the phrase was adapted and widely adopted within Australian public discourse. Howard scored a sweeping victory at the 1996 elections, an achievement some commentators explained by reference to his winning over many traditional Labor Party voters, whom they now termed \\"Howard's battlers\\".Journal of Australian Studies, Issue 55, 1997, Abstract The term was allegedly popularised by Andrew Robb, the 1996 Liberal Party campaign director, who used it to describe those blue-collar voters who felt ignored by Labor and who were successfully targeted by the Liberals during the election campaign.[\\"] In a radio interview in 2004, Howard was asked what he thought a 'battler' was and replied that: During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Sydney in September 2007, US President George W. Bush referred to Howard himself as being a 'battler'.

In relation to Taekwondo, it was the name that some major schools in South Korea agreed to call their martial art systems due to reactions to controversies within the Taekwondo communities in the early 1960s. In relation to Hwa Rang Do, Tae Soo Do is the name of their introductory program to help students develop their fundamentals and help prepare them for their training in Hwa Rang Do. Modern day Tae Soo Do/ Hwa Rang Do has no connection with Taekwondo and one should not be mistaken for the other.  Previous Use in Relation to Taekwondo  In 1961, the name Taekwondo was temporarily dropped by members of the Taekwondo community due to controversies that arose between various schools and practitioners. In response to these controversies, several of the schools choose to change the name of their art to Tae Soo Do and The Korea Tae Soo Do Association submitted its documented to the Ministry of Education on September 22, 1961.Portions of The Modern History of TaeKwonDo, by Won Sik Kang and Kyong Myong Lee. A general in the Korean military and a predominant member of the Taekwondo community, Choi Hong Hi, was unhappy with this change and in 1965, he succeeded in changing the name of the art back to Taekwondo with the reformation of The Korean Taekwondo Association. Today, the name Tae Soo Do is no longer used by Taekwondo practitioners or schools. Very few people who practice Taekwondo today will recognize the name except for its modern use with the Hwa Rang Do community. In the west, the art was always referred to as \\"Tae Kwon Do\\" (or \\"Taekwondo\\", the western form of the name), due to that the controversies that happened in Korea during the early 1960s never made their way over to the United States aside from a very select few, who chose to watch eastern culture and events closely in order to keep traditions alive and accurate.  Modern Use in Relation to Hwa Rang Do  Today, the name Tae Soo Do (Way of the Warrior Spirit, ) refers to a martial art program created in 1990 by the World Hwa Rang Do Association as a beginners program to the martial art system Hwa Rang Do. The World Hwa Rang Do Association decided to use the name because functionally it expressed what they were working to achieve with the students who participate within the program and since it had been rejected outright by General Choi and the Taekwondo community decades earlier, they didn't see an issue using it.http://hwarangdo.com/hrd- history/hwa-rang-do-history/  References  South Korean martial arts ","title":"Tae Soo Do"},{"id":"3520464","title":"Yelena Slesarenko"},{"id":"3520478","text":"Baumann () may refer to: * Baumann (surname) * Mount Baumann, mountain in Togo See also * Baumann's Cave * Bauman * Bowman (disambiguation) * Paumann ","title":"Baumann"},{"id":"3520480","text":"Bauman is a surname.

It is located on Highway 3 in southern Alberta, approximately from the United States border and southeast of Calgary.  History  The community of Bow Island received its first post- colonial families in 1900. In February 1910, the Village of Bow Island was formed, and by March 1912 the village was declared the Town of Bow Island. The naming of Bow Island brings many stories to the forefront, but the most prominent one is that the communities of Grassy Lake, approximately to the west, and Bow Island had their respective names mixed up. An island named \\"Bow Island\\" is located north of Grassy Lake near the confluence of the Bow River and the Oldman River, while a low depressional area named \\"Grassy Lake\\" is located south of Bow Island. Bow Island was one of the first towns in Alberta to have natural gas wells and operated them until the franchise was sold to a private company. In the early 1950s, irrigation was extended to the Bow Island area, and the town doubled in population. Bow Island is surrounded by 110,000 acres (445 km¬≤) of highly productive lands. Some of the most modern irrigation systems in the world are located in the area; the first pivot and linear sprinkler systems in Canada were erected in the Bow Island area. A completely automated distribution system was installed in 1982 by the St. Mary River Irrigation District (SMRID), and it serves an area of 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤). The system is known as the Lateral 12 System and has been toured by groups from around the world.  Geography  Bow Island is located between the cities of Lethbridge and Medicine Hat.

His father died of cholera when he was two, and his mother took him to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and later Brooklyn, New York City before settling in Kentucky in the 1850s. By that time she had remarried to Daniel Ruttle. In 1861, at the age of 16, Gwydir enlisted in the Confederate States Army, spying and scouting for John Hunt Morgan's raiders of Covington, Kentucky. After the American Civil War, Gwydir worked for his stepfather in the pork packing and distillation business before embarking on his long career in public service. He served as Covington's Superintendent of Public Works and city auditor, and as gauger for the Internal Revenue Service. In 1886, President Grover Cleveland appointed Gwydir Indian agent to the Colville Indian Reservation in Northeast Washington. This began his life as a pioneer, diplomat, administrator, and appreciator of Indian and pioneer life. In 1889 he prospected gold and mined the remote hills of the Inland Empire, and he served as Chinese Inspector for the Treasury from 1893 to 1898. In 1901 Gwydir settled in Spokane and became a prominent resident and respected public servant there. Newspapers from the era refer to him frequently; he was known as the \\"Barbecue King of the Inland Empire\\" as well as for his vigorous health. Although Gwydir served as Indian agent after sweeping reforms in Indian policy, the paternalistic attitude towards Native Americans typical of the time is evident in his writings. Nonetheless, his fair dealings with the tribes in his charge earned him their respect, and he repeatedly urged the government to provide more material support to the Indians, especially when promises had yet to be kept. Gwydir left a memoir of his frontier experiences wherein he recorded oral traditions of both settlers and Indians. He wrote and commented on Okanogan Smith, Chief Tonasket, Chief Joseph, Chief Moses, and Skolaskin, the prophet-chief of the fiercely independent Sanpoil. His chief concern in his writings is the preservation of the history of the early settlers of the region and the recognition of their efforts to tame the wild country. Gwydir died on November 7, 1925 and is buried in Riverside Memorial Park in Spokane, Washington. References Sources *Gwydir, Rickard D., edited and with an introduction by Kevin Dye.

It is named the hyperexponential distribution since its coefficient of variation is greater than that of the exponential distribution, whose coefficient of variation is 1, and the hypoexponential distribution, which has a coefficient of variation smaller than one. While the exponential distribution is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, the hyperexponential distribution is not analogous to the hypergeometric distribution. The hyperexponential distribution is an example of a mixture density. An example of a hyperexponential random variable can be seen in the context of telephony, where, if someone has a modem and a phone, their phone line usage could be modeled as a hyperexponential distribution where there is probability p of them talking on the phone with rate Œª1 and probability q of them using their internet connection with rate Œª2. Properties Since the expected value of a sum is the sum of the expected values, the expected value of a hyperexponential random variable can be shown as : E[X] = int_{-infty}^infty x f(x) , dx= sum_{i=1}^n p_iint_0^infty xlambda_i e^{-lambda_ix} , dx = sum_{i=1}^n frac{p_i}{lambda_i} and : E!left[X^2right] = int_{-infty}^infty x^2 f(x) , dx = sum_{i=1}^n p_iint_0^infty x^2lambda_i e^{-lambda_ix} , dx = sum_{i=1}^n frac{2}{lambda_i^2}p_i, from which we can derive the variance: :operatorname{Var}[X] = E!left[X^2right] - E!left[Xright]^2 = sum_{i=1}^n frac{2}{lambda_i^2}p_i - left[sum_{i=1}^n frac{p_i}{lambda_i}right]^2 = left[sum_{i=1}^n frac{p_i}{lambda_i}right]^2 + sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1}^n p_i p_j left(frac{1}{lambda_i} - frac{1}{lambda_j} right)^2. The standard deviation exceeds the mean in general (except for the degenerate case of all the Œªs being equal), so the coefficient of variation is greater than 1. The moment-generating function is given by :E!left[e^{tx}right] = int_{-infty}^infty e^{tx} f(x) , dx= sum_{i=1}^n p_i int_0^infty e^{tx}lambda_i e^{-lambda_i x} , dx = sum_{i=1}^n frac{lambda_i}{lambda_i - t}p_i. Fitting A given probability distribution, including a heavy-tailed distribution, can be approximated by a hyperexponential distribution by fitting recursively to different time scales using Prony's method.

The novella was included in the anthology Nebula Award Stories Eight. Title The title of this collection of novellas is a play on words which refers to Cerberus, a three-headed dog from Greek mythology, which guarded the gate to the Greek underworld, Hades. In the first novella the protagonist explains that Cerberus represents his own family, its three heads being his father, aunt and Mr. Million, adding that its \\"unseen\\" heads are his brother David as fourth and, by implication, the fifth and final the narrator's own. Following this logic, the title of the novella therefore refers to the narrator himself, whose story we read. Further parallels between the narrator's family and the mythology of Cerberus can be drawn in numerous other ways throughout this novella. For example, a statue of this mythological creature exists at the front, or \\"gates\\" of their family home, which is itself located at 666 Saltimbanque, this number having associations with the underworld dating back to the Greek manuscripts of the Book of Revelations. Also, their family home is later referred to at one point as the Maison du Chien, literally \\"House of the Dog\\". Single-volume collection The collection is an expansion of the first novella, originally published in the Orbit 10 anthology edited by Damon Knight in 1972.Orbit, volume 10, at Locus Magazine The following novellas, \\"A Story\\" by John V. Marsch and V.R.T. expand on the plot and themes of the first. These works are set on two colony worlds, 20 light-years from Earth, the double planets of Sainte Anne and Sainte Croix, originally settled by French-speaking colonists, but lost by them in a war with an unnamed enemy. Sainte Anne was (perhaps) once home to an indigenous aboriginal culture (at an apparently pre- paleolithic level of technology) of shapeshifters, who may ‚Äì or may not ‚Äì have been wiped out by the human incomers. Wolfe presented the title novella at a Milford Writer's Workshop. Norbert Slepyan, an editor at Scribner's, was impressed by the story and proposed that Wolfe write two more, related novellas, to be published in a single book.Larry McCaffery, \\"On Encompassing the Entire Universe: An Interview with Gene Wolfe\\" Novellas =The Fifth Head of Cerberus= The title story is in the form of a biographical study, the narrator of which looks back on his boyhood and youth on the planet of Sainte Croix, and the events which led to his long, harsh incarceration, and eventual freedom. Brought up in relative comfort in a large house (a brothel run by his father and aunt, staffed by several genetically enhanced \\"demimondaines\\"), he and his younger brother David are privately tutored by a robotic servant and often go outside the house for short trips. One evening his old life ends when he is called to attend to his father, a distant figure. He is told that his name is now \\"Number 5\\", and after a period of questioning he is given a barrage of psychological, visual, drug, and association tests, which endure for some time. Finally released, he feels very drained. He finds out that David has been treated similarly; both boys undergo this treatment regularly for years afterward, though Number 5 is treated more severely, and begins to experience painful headaches and memory lapses. He meets his aunt for the first time, who seems to know about Veil's Hypothesis (the theory that the Sainte Anne aboriginals could mimic the human settlers so perfectly that they killed them and took their places) and is given light duties in the running of the family business. He also meets John Marsch, an anthropologist from Earth, when he visits the house. He is visiting Aubrey Veil, author of the hypothesis, who happens to be Number 5's aunt. Befriending a girl, she, he, and David get involved in amateur dramatics; money being short, they decide to break into a slave trader's warehouse to steal some cash. There, they meet a surgically altered human slave who bears an uncanny resemblance to him, and his father. After it attacks them, they kill it and run away. Finally sick of his father's ongoing experiments on him, Number 5 decides to kill him. His resolve is bolstered after another visit by Marsch, who casually informs him that he, Number 5, and his father are clones ‚Äì only two of many. This conversation is ended when Number 5 identifies Marsch as being an aboriginal, based on evidence never specified explicitly in the book. He kills his father, but is discovered and incarcerated. After nine years of imprisonment, Number 5 takes his father's place as head of the family estate. =\\"A Story,\\" by John V. Marsch= In this hallucinatory tale from pre-contact Sainte Anne, Sandwalker sets out on a dreamquest to find \\"the priest\\", in his lonely cave, to commune with him. Sleeping at the entrance to the cave, he and his twin, Eastwind, unaware of each other's existence, dream of each other. Waking, Sandwalker goes out to hunt, where he meets the Shadow Children, an ethereal, nocturnal race, and they make an alliance by sharing food and learning each other's songs. Walking on, he meets a girl and a baby, whom he befriends. After sleeping with her, and hunting for more food, he decides to follow the river downstream to the marshes. He manages to rescue some Shadow children from enemy marshmen, whom he kills. Learning that his mother and friends have been captured by other marshmen and taken away, he decides to follow and rescue them as well. Followed by the Shadow children, they are all, themselves, captured and thrown into a large pit, where he finds his mother and friends; they are all due to be sacrificed by the marshmen, so their souls will enter the river and carry messages from them to the stars. His twin, Eastwind, belongs to the tribe who captured him. The Shadow Children, whose thoughts, for many years, have spread out into space and protected the world from discovery by alien races (such as they were, originally) decide to relinquish this protection, which attracts a passing starcrosser, and in the excitement of its landing nearby, they escape, and nothing is the same ever again. =V.R.T.= John Marsch, the anthropologist from the first story, has been imprisoned in a Sainte Croix jail, ostensibly for espionage and assassination. After a few years of captivity, all of it in solitary confinement, Marsch's case is being reviewed by an unnamed security official who must go over the files and determine the next stage in his punishment. These files consist of Marsch's logs from his previous anthropological visit to Sainte Anne, interspersed with taped recordings of his interrogation sessions. The interrogator believes it is obvious that Marsch has never been to Earth, although Marsch is not shown as betraying his origins in the text. On Sainte Anne to study the mystery of the original inhabitants, Marsch hires a local boy (VRT) from his father, who claims the boy is half-aboriginal. Both the father and the son claim that aboriginals can still be encountered in the deep countryside, so a mission is undertaken to explore. The two set out into the wilderness. Much time is spent looking for them, but Marsch, despite coming into contact with many examples of Annese wildlife and learning much from the boy (and he from him), never seems to find what he is looking for. Over time, they develop a camp follower, a cat. Marsch suspects at around the same time that the cat joins their company that the boy has been having visitations by a woman. Later, an accident occurs in which the boy dies. After that, Marsch continues exploring on his own, but he has changed in ways that the alert reader will find suspicious. On his return to civilization, he visits the brothel run by Number 5's father to interview Dr. Veil. Soon after, he is arrested, tried, and imprisoned for the crimes mentioned, above. In his memories and dreams, it is revealed that Marsch may in fact be the boy, their identity overlapping. The vital inference of this story is that Veil's hypothesis is indeed correct, the boy assuming Marsch's identity, a wound suffered from the cat being a convenient explanation for the marked decline in hand-writing quality, the native Annese being renowned for their inability to use tools.

Early life and education Kostant grew up in New York City, where he graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1945. He went on to obtain an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Purdue University in 1950. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1954, under the direction of Irving Segal, where he wrote a dissertation on representations of Lie groups. Career in mathematics After time at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University, and the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he remained until his retirement in 1993. Kostant's work has involved representation theory, Lie groups, Lie algebras, homogeneous spaces, differential geometry and mathematical physics, particularly symplectic geometry. He has given several lectures on the Lie group E8. He has been one of the principal developers of the theory of geometric quantization. His introduction of the theory of prequantization has led to the theory of quantum Toda lattices. The Kostant partition function is named after him. With Gerhard Hochschild and Alex F. T. W.

Gi·∫£n ƒê·ªãnh ƒê·∫ø (1407‚Äì1409) A younger son of the late emperor Tr·∫ßn Ngh·ªá T√¥ng, Tr·∫ßn Ng·ªói rose his banner in 1406, proclaimed himself the Gi·∫£n ƒê·ªãnh emperor and started a revolt. His base was first centered in Ninh B√¨nh Province and was supported by Tran Trieu Co, a mandarin under the late Tr·∫ßn dynasty. Lacking the materials and poorly managed, he was defeated, abandoned Ninh B√¨nh and fled further south into the province of Thanh Hoa. Here he met Dang Tat who at that same time was waging a revolt also against the administration of the Ming. Dang Tat was a high-ranking official under the Tr·∫ßn dynasty. The ranking and followers of Gi·∫£n ƒê·ªãnh together with Dang Tat kept swelling and gained more and more support from the Viet people since 1408. Gathering momentum and popularity, Gian Dinh moved further north with a small army, defeated the Ming in a battle at Bo Co in which Lu Nghi, a Ming general, was fatally wounded. Gian Dinh, victorious, would like to wage wars further north, right into ThƒÉng Long, the capital. But Dang Tat, his lieutenant, stopped him and advised him not to, judging that his army is still small, ill-organized and does not have enough weaponry, or supply for a long war. Another advocate with him, Nguy·ªÖn C·∫£nh Ch√¢n, a former minor general under the Tran, also pleaded not to wage a bigger war with the Ming who at that time still control most of the territories. However, Gian Dinh, not taking any advice, is riding on his pride. He soon has his 2 best lieutenants both Nguy·ªÖn C·∫£nh Ch√¢n and Dang Tat arrested and killed, causing a dissension in his army and revolt. Gian Dinh moved along with his plan, revolt and continued waging wars with the Ming until he was captured by the Ming and slain around 1410. Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng (1409‚Äì1413) Meanwhile, the other side who supported Dang Tat and Nguy·ªÖn C·∫£nh Ch√¢n, now has 2 new figures: Dang Dung and Nguyen Canh Di, both are sons of Dang Tat and Nguyen Chan respectively. These 2 men search for a new master. They found Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng, a nephew of the late emperor Tr·∫ßn Ngh·ªá T√¥ng. Even within the ranks of the rebellions, there were rifts and disagreements instead of unity. Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng on his side waged war against the Ming invaders. On the other side, Gian Dinh De has his. Knowing the rift and weakness of the revolt, the Ming took the initiative to attack Thanh H√≥a and Ngh·ªá An in 1413. That proved disastrous for Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng. Both Gian Dinh and Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng retreated to the mountains and forests. Their situation is going bleak, not enough supplies. The flame of their resistance faded, and faded. Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng was captured together with his whole clan in 1413. He committed suicide. Along a few years later, a new resistance movement was born under L√™ L·ª£i's banner.

She first became involved with chess as a \\"ChessMom\\", flying her young son, John Jarecki, who became the youngest ever chess master in U.S. history at the age of 12 in 1981 (the record was soon surpassed by a slightly younger Stuart Rachels), to various chess events in the United States. Soon, she started working at those tournaments and eventually became a certified tournament director at the highest National Tournament Director level. She has continued directing, although her son is no longer an active player. She has directed many prestigious chess events including serving as Head Tournament Director at several U.S. Chess Championships, SuperNational Scholastic Championships, National Elementary Championships, and World Opens in Philadelphia as well as many other national tournaments large and small. She has been the chief arbiter at the Bermuda International Open and associated invitationals for over 20 years. She is also an International Arbiter recognized by FIDE, the World Chess Federation. She regularly works the World Chess Olympiad, sometimes as the Head Arbiter. She is also the Delegate from the British Virgin Islands to the FIDE Congress. She was the Chief Arbiter at the PCA World Chess Championship match in 1995 in New York City held at the top of the World Trade Center, between World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Viswanathan Anand. Jarecki was the arbiter and referee for the high-profile match between Kasparov and the IBM supercomputer program Deep Blue in 1997 in New York City, as well as the two Intel Grand Prix matches held there. She was the head arbiter for the HB Global Chess Challenge, Minneapolis 2005, which had the richest prize fund ($500,000) for an Open tournament in chess history. Outside of chess, Jarecki is known for a very successful run of roulette winnings with her husband Dr. Richard Jarecki in the 1970s, playing in casinos in Monte Carlo and San Remo, using a system based on finding roulette wheels biased by mechanical imperfections.

The game takes place in a fictional alternate reality where countries have access to highly advanced magitechnology. In the process of creating monsters with this technology using an ancient creature named \\"The Gods of Magic\\"; it broke free of its bonds and took control of the secret facility and proceeded to slay all of the research team and arm the compounds defenses. The player is a commander in charge of the Cyborg Enforcer Teams sent into the dungeon to reclaim it. The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the game's main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters.  Gameplay  As the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter the height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hairstyle as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters. Once inside the dungeon, the player's team must move around, find monsters and equipment while leveling up. A major point unsaid in-game is that you are not expected to be able to beat a level's boss on the first time entering the level; as you could only allocate level up points while out of the dungeon. Dungeons were randomly generated, most adhering to a typical design that made the map seem less random then it was. Each level has a control room that could possibly be locked, holding a boss monster that must be defeated to win the level and unlock the next one. Fencer Fighter class that could use Hammers or Swords and had the rare chance of performing a move like a Final Fantasy \\"Limit Break\\" that would damage all enemies at once. Analyzer Ranged in class. Without an Analyzer in the party, the player is unable to know how much health enemies have and their current HP amount. Analyzers used firearms ranging from laser beams, to machine guns, to rocket launchers that all shared the same in-game model. Caster Basic Spell Caster that could be wired with a variety of Spell Chips either bought from the in- game shop or found in the dungeon. Each spell had a number of charges that had to be refilled by visiting the surface. Casters automatically blocked until the player told them what spell to use. Broader The Jack-Of-All-Trades class that had a flat rate for all skill gains at the expense of leveling up extremely slowly and was reserved for advanced players that foresaw spending a large time grinding. Striker A barbarian class that used combat gloves as their weapon. Each strike had a rare chance of instantly killing a non-boss enemy.  Reception  The game received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 23 out of 40.

Centina III (May 19, 1947 ‚Äì May 1, 2020), an award-winning Catholic poet,1974 Palanca Awards was the author of nine poetry books, two novels and a book of literary criticism. Respected for his poetry, his works have been anthologized in Philippine high school and college textbooks and published in the Philippines, Spain, Canada and the United States. Besides English, he also wrote in Spanish and in two Philippine languages, Hiligaynon and Tagalog. He received the Catholic Authors Award in 1996 from the Asian Catholic Publishers and the Archdiocese of Manila under Cardinal Jaime Sin. Centina was an Augustinian friar under the Spanish circumscription of the Madrid-based Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines. In 2020, he became a charter member of the Augustinian Province of St. John of Sahag√∫n of Spain which was formed when the Philippine province and three other provinces in Spain and Portugal united into a single circumscription. For his efforts to preserve the Spanish language in the Philippines through his essays and poetry, he was praised as a \\"defender of the Spanish language\\" in that country. Early life and Education Born in La Carlota City on May 19, 1947, he was the second child of Luis T. Centina Jr., an educator, and Eva G√≥mez Ramos, a homemaker. He came from a family of artists, according to his biography in his official web site. His father, an educator, contributed articles to national magazines in the Philippines and authored a posthumously published book, Almost on the Carpet. One of his two younger sisters is a painter while two of his four brothers are poets. His artistic bent drew inspiration from a childhood surrounded with charcoal etchings by his maternal grandfather. After graduating from La Carlota High School, he attended a number of colleges in his freshman year in university, including La Consolacion College Bacolod in Bacolod City, University of Negros Occidental - Recoletos, also in the same city, and University of San Agustin in Iloilo City. In 1964, he entered the Augustinian Monastery in historic Intramuros, Manila and attended the University of Santo Tomas, the Philippines' royal and pontifical university. He graduated cum laude in each of his four ecclesiastical degrees from the University of Santo Tomas: BA classical, Ph.B., STB, and STL. He earned his MA in comparative literature at the University of the Philippines and completed the coursework toward a Ph.D. in comparative literature at another state university but left without completing his dissertation. Roman Catholic Priesthood After his ordination to the priesthood, he briefly served as a missionary in Peru. He taught literature as a professorial lecturer, served as a school chaplain for many years and as the first pastor of Filipino ancestry of Holy Rosary Church (Manhattan) in East Harlem, New York. Along the way, he authored hundreds of newspaper columns and magazine articles as well as edited a scholarly journal on St. Augustine and contributed poetry and fiction to literary publications. He lived and worked in Spain for seven years, from 2013 until his death in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. His assignment at the Augustinian-run parish of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel in Neguri near Bilbao was cut short by an illness which necessitated his transfer to Colegio Andr√©s de Urdaneta in Loui, Vizcaya in September 2018 and to Colegio de Nuestra Madre del Buen Consejo in Le√≥n in April the following year. Literary works and criticisms At the time of his death on May 1, 2020, due to complications from COVID-19 in the northwestern city of Le√≥n, Spain, Centina had just completed his ninth poetry collection, Recovecos/Crevices. The poetry book, which contains three hundred fifty poems in Spanish and English, is his third bilingual poetry collection. He started producing bilingual books in English and Spanish after rediscovering his Spanish roots in Spain, where he was assigned from 2013 until his death in 2020 and where he found a receptive and growing audience. His time in Spain was marked with an explosion of creativity, resulting in the publication of six poetry books, a novel and a book of literary criticism. Such was the intensity of his creativity that in less than a year, he was able to produce three poetry books Madre Espa√±a, which he released in July 2019, quickly followed by Plus Ultra y otros poemas/Plus Ultra and Other Poems, which was published in January 2020 and Recovecos/Crevices, which he completed two weeks prior to his death and was posthumously published in August 2020. These three books were produced under very difficult circumstances for Centina who struggled with his health after a difficult kidney transplant surgery in June 2018 at Bilbao's Cruces Hospital, where he underwent seven surgeries in a span of one month as surgeons struggled to fix a leaking bladder that was causing him constant infections. In the end, they attached a nephrostomy tube to his new kidney into a collecting bag outside his body. He hinted about his health problems in the preface to his book Madre Espa√±a, in which he thanked the Spanish people for their generosity: \\"I am writing this a year to the day I underwent a life- saving surgery, full of gratitude in my heart for the hospitality and the generosity of the Spanish people, which have sustained me in my long and continuing journey to recovery. Their selflessness exemplifies the nobility of their Iberian roots.\\" Author and award-winning poet Thomas R. Caffrey, in his introduction to Recovecos/Crevices, praised the book: \\"In his rhythmic verse the script artist strikes a chord that reverberates throughout us, transforming the mechanistic words into vibrant song and our stasis into action. Today‚Äôs brain science has discovered what the psalmists, poets and ancient musicians could only know by intuition: that music, melody or verse stimulate us to movement and emotion. We become unstuck. Our losing streak ends. Whether in grief or joy, our prayers become that green and fruitful oasis.\\" On April 7, 2013, he published Somewhen\\"Somewhen\\" lhttp://gilbertluisrcentinaiii.com/priesthood-of-literature.html in the United States, his third poetry book. Portland Book Review described Somewhen as \\"modern poetry at its best,\\" adding that \\"for modern poetry to be this eloquent and thought provoking is a grave task that Centina III accomplishes splendidly.\\" Sacramento Book Review called the book \\"lyrical\\" and \\"positively radiant\\" and noted that it is \\"deeply rooted in religious history, mythology and mysticism.\\" The collection, it added, \\"honors the [Catholic] church's fortitude, individual spirit and conviction, belief and the voyage thereof.\\" The collection marked his comeback to poetry writing after a long hiatus that followed his winning the Focus Literary Awards in poetry in 1982. Along the way, he devoted himself to his priestly duties and limited his writing to newspaper columns. During this time, he served as editor-in-chief of Search, a journal on the life and works of St. Augustine of Hippo published in Makati City, Philippines, by Colegio San Agustin-Makati. Somewhen was followed by the publication of Rubrics and Runes (New York: June 2013), Triptych and Collected Poems (New York: August 2013) and Getxo and Other Poems (New York: January 2014). His earlier books of poems, Our Hidden Glaxette and Glass of Liquid Truths, were also republished in May 2013. Our Hidden Galaxette His first novel is a roman √† clef, written under a nom de plume. The novel, Wages of Sin, was published as a limited edition in Honolulu in 1988. On June 20, 2013, he released under his real name his controversial second novel Rubrics and Runes, a satire tackling clericalism, simony, financial shenanigans and sex abuse in the Catholic Church as perpetrated by some misguided churchmen. According to the blurb of Rubrics and Runes, it \\"tells the story of a friar who gets caught in the maelstrom of conventual and secular politics when the two supposedly incongruous worlds collide. When Jos√© Mor√°n entered the monastery, it was to pursue the highest form of chivalry. But his fate as a religious priest takes a precipitous turn when social paroxysm grips the fictional island-nation of Islas e Islotes after the downfall of the government. To cover up his own misdeeds, his abominably corrupt religious superior leading a double life seizes the ensuing chaos and collaborates with human rights violators in military uniform to accuse the completely innocent friar of a fabricated heinous crime. The plot unravels as those who claim to follow Christ wade into politics, taking for granted his injunction to 'render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar‚Äôs and unto God the things that are God‚Äôs.'\\" In an article titled \\"Una Perspectiva Hist√≥r√≠ca de la Poes√≠a Hispanofilipina\\" that he wrote for Universidad de Murcia, Edmundo Farolan, poet and correspondent of the Real Academia Espa√±ola, cited Centina's poetry in Spanish as belonging to an avant-garde group of Filipino poets who ‚Äúin addition to Castilian...write in other languages and in different styles and themes‚Äîfree verse and prose, to traditional metrics surrealist themes, Dadaists and protest, realistic subjects, religious and serene. Avant-garde, but returning to the castellano classics: Quevedo, Gongora, Santa Teresa de Jesus, Manrique and Garcilaso de la Vega.\\" In May 2017, he published Diptych/D√≠ptico, his first bilingual (English-Spanish) poetry collection. Midwest Book Review'praised the book as a \\"beautiful synthesis of poetry, philosophy, spirituality and psychological inspection that is well illustrated especially recommended for poetry readers who seek a journey from individual inspection to universal spiritual truth...\\" In December 2017, Centina came out with Spiritual Quest in Verse: A Literary Criticism of the Religious Poetry of Ricardo Demetillo. Defender of the Spanish language After his death, ABC, the Spanish newspaper of record, hailed Centina in its May 12, 2020 issue (p. 54) as \\"a defender of the Spanish language\\" in his native Philippines: \\"As an advocate for the preservation of the Spanish language in the Philippines, Father Cen¬≠tina supported the work of Hispanists to 'spread, defend and exalt' the Spanish language in that country. It is from this noble cause that he obtained his inspiration to write his bilingual poetry books in Spanish and English. For more than three centuries - it can be recalled - the Philippines formed a treasured part of the Spanish Empire,\\" adding that \\"his large body of work assures him a solid place in Philippine literature in English and Spanish, as well as in Catholic poetry.\\" Diario de Le√≥n echoed ABC's observation, saying \\"he was a well-known and award winning poet and author who fought for the preservation of the Spanish language in his homeland, asserting that the Spanish roots of the Philippines form the core of his country's cultural soul.\\" The National Catholic Reporter noted that he was \\"a celebrated Catholic author and poet, [whose] accolades include the Palanca Memorial Awards, the Philippines‚Äô highest literary honor, in English poetry in 1974, the Focus Literary Awards in English poetry in 1982, and the Catholic Authors Award in 1998 from the Archdiocese of Manila under then Cardinal Jaime L. Sin and the Asian Catholic Publishers.\\" His work, it added, was \\"a conscience that attacks and spares no one except the weak. It is full of intrinsic insights into humanity and its connection with a greater being. His work explores the relationship between man and his Creator, between space and time, and between the earthly and heavenly continuums of life, alongside our overwhelming shared sense of love, courage and hope.\\" As a testament to his importance as a writer, he was included among the most notable Augustinian men and women since the founding of the Augustinian Order in 1244 in a seminal encyclopedia compiled and edited by Spanish author and academic Rafael Lazcano, arguably the foremost expert on the Augustinian Order in the world today. The multivolume encyclopedia, Tesauro Agustiniano, also includes members of the Augustinian Recollects since their founding in 1588 as well as those of the women branches of the Augustinian religious family.

Eckville relocated to its current location in 1912, after the Canadian Northern Railway completed its local line. The current location on the Canadian Northern Railway was briefly known as Kootuk, but the name Eckville prevailed. Eckville was incorporated as a village in 1921 and became a town in 1966.

Often, focusing screens are available in variants with different etched markings for various purposes. For instance, \\"overall matte\\" focusing screens with no etchings are a popular choice for astrophotography and other low-light situations. Overview The history of the focusing screen is almost as long as the history of the camera. Some primitive cameras consisted of a box with a board holding the lens in the front and a focusing screen in the back that was replaced by the imaging medium (plate, film holder) before taking the picture. The most common type of focusing screen in non-autofocus 35 mm SLR cameras is the split screen and microprism ring variation that aids focusing and became standard in the 1980s. The microprism ring breaks up the image unless the lens setting is in focus, the split screen shows part of the image split in two pieces. When both pieces are aligned the setting is in focus. The drawback is that the prisms have considerable light loss, making low-light focusing almost impossible. Compare with focusing mechanism in rangefinder cameras. Professional cameras give the photographer a choice of screens that are, depending on the camera model, more or less easy to replace. For low light situations the screen of choice is plain, for architectural images and very wide angle lenses the choice is one with a grid etched on it to control the perspective distortion, for fast focusing the split screen is the screen of choice and so on. Cameras with interchangeable film formats (view cameras, field cameras and some medium format cameras) may have etchings on the focusing screen to show the limits of the films. Most of these cameras have either plain or grid screens because due to the size of the focusing screen the only focusing aid really needed is a magnifying glass. Autofocus SLR cameras, both digital and film, usually have a plain screen. Some models have markings etched in them to denote the areas on which the camera focuses or calculates the exposure from. Many of the newest midrange and professional digital SLR cameras possess a plain screen with a monochromatic LCD overlay that reveals focus points as needed.

It is located on Highway 43, approximately northwest of Edmonton and southeast of Grande Prairie, and has an elevation of . Fox Creek is within the Upper Peace planning region, and is surrounded by the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16.  History  On June 6, 1952, the townsite for a future community was selected by Ryan Krause and Victor Heath. It was named Fox Creek after the watercourse adjacent to the western edge of the townsite, which drains towards Iosegun Lake to the north. The original survey of the townsite occurred over three days in late October, 1955. At the same time, a townsite for another future community was surveyed to the north of Fox Creek on Iosegun Lake's eastern shore. This townsite turned out to be too wet, resulting in no development interest. The provincial government subsequently abandoned plans to develop a community at this location. Residents began settling in Fox Creek shortly after Highway 43 officially opened in the fall of 1955, attracted by opportunities in the forestry and oil and gas exploration industries. The first two houses were built by Alberta Forest Services in 1956 to support a new ranger station that opened in 1957. Fox Creek's first two roadways, 1 Street West (the initial stage of Kaybob Drive) and Highway Avenue, were also constructed in 1956. In 1957, the first significant oil field was discovered north of Fox Creek, known as the Kaybob North Field, and the community's first two businesses were established. Both businesses were services stations ‚Äì under the British American and Imperial Oil banners ‚Äì each with associated restaurants. The community's post office was founded on March 18, 1958. It was named the Iosegun Lake Post Office, which was not officially renamed to the Fox Creek Post Office until 10 years later. The late 1950s and early 1960s brought much activity to the Hamlet of Fox Creek as numerous sawmills, drilling rigs, and camps supporting drilling and road construction activities had established in the area. A total of 12 oil and gas fields were discovered over a six-year span between 1957 and 1962, of which included the discovery of a significant gas field to the south of Fox Creek in 1961 known as the Kaybob South Field. These discoveries triggered the construction of five gas plants in the Fox Creek area over the eleven years that followed the discovery of the Kaybob South Field. The 1961 Census of Canada was the first census to record Fox Creek's population, but under the name of Iosegun Lake after the post office in the community. Its population in 1961 was 144. Over the following five years, Fox Creek grew to 187 residents according to the 1966 Census of Canada. Under the signature of Premier Ernest Manning on July 19, 1967, the Province of Alberta incorporated the community as the New Town of Fox Creek. A three- member Board of Administrators was appointed at the time of incorporation, which included resident and businessman Otto Ritter as chairman and two public administrators from Alberta Municipal Affairs, Earl Briscoe (deputy chairman) and Len Gurel.  Geography  The town is within of three lakes ‚Äì Smoke Lake to the southwest, Iosegun Lake to the north, and Raspberry Lake to the northeast. The Fox Creek flows through the community, which empties into Iosegun Lake. The Fox Creek area was subject to three earthquakes in 2015. The first occurred on January 14, 2015 approximately west of Fox Creek, measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale, while the second, measuring 4.4, occurred on January 22, 2015 approximately west of the town. No damages were reported on the former, while the latter was \\"lightly felt\\" within Fox Creek and has been reported as potentially being related to hydraulic fracturing within the Duvernay Formation. A third earthquake, measuring 4.4, occurred approximately east of the community on June 13, 2015.  Demographics  The population of the Town of Fox Creek according to its 2019 municipal census is 2,189, a change of from its 2013 municipal census population of 2,112. In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Fox Creek recorded a population of 1,971 living in 775 of its 1,054 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 1,969. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Fox Creek had a population of 1,969 living in 773 of its 980 total dwellings, a ‚àí13.6% change from its 2006 population of 2,278. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Government  Fox Creek Town Council consists of a mayor and six councilors. The Mayor and Councillors were elected in the 2017 municipal election. The current members of town council are Mayor James Hailes and Councillors Brenda Burridge, Dian Ahn, Meesha Bainton, Wendy Rieger, Sheila Gilmour, and Shawn Watson. The town's chief administrative officer is Roy Dell. Fox Creek is located within the Grande Prairie-Smoky provincial electoral district, represented by Progressive Conservative Todd Loewen. At the federal level, Fox Creek is located within the Yellowhead electoral district and is represented by Conservative Jim Eglinski. For the next federal election, Fox Creek will become part of the newly created riding of Peace River‚ÄîWestlock.  Economy  Fox Creek's economy is driven by the resource industry with oil and gas playing the primary role. The major oil and gas employer in the area, since the first decade of the 21st century, is SemCAMS, which purchased various area facilities previously owned by a mix of Chevron, BP Amoco and Petro-Canada. , the company owns and operates two sour gas processing plants (Kaybob South No. 3 and Kaybob Amalgamated), a sweet gas processing plant (West Fox Creek), and numerous pipelines in the area. The oilfield service industry supports oil and gas activities in the area, with numerous drilling and well service companies having branch offices in Fox Creek. Fox Creek's secondary resource-based industry is forestry. Its role in Fox Creek's economy was threatened after a fire destroyed the area's lone sawmill ‚Äì owned and operated by Millar Western Forest Products Ltd. ‚Äì on August 29, 2008. After nearly two years of uncertainty about forestry's re- emergence in the local economy, Millar Western announced on June 18, 2010 that it would rebuild the Fox Creek sawmill. the sawmill, named the Fox Creek Wood Products Division, employs 55 full-time staff producing dimension lumber in the amount of 620,000 board feet per shift or 125 million board feet per year. It has been operating on a single shift since full startup, which occurred in late 2011. The Fox Creek sawmill was acquired by Millar Western from Mostowich Lumber on August 1, 2007. Other employers in Fox Creek are small in comparison to SemCAMS, Millar Western, and the oilfield service industry. Due to the town's location on Highway 43, the town has numerous service industry businesses that cater to travelers and workers supporting the oil and gas industry, as well as trucking operations.  Education  Fox Creek School, operated by Northern Gateway Public Schools, is the primary educational institution in Fox Creek, serving students from Kindergarten to Grade 12. The school was attended by 455 students during the 2009/2010 school year, including 14 students in the Fox Creek Talent Developmental Centre program.

It is one of the three main arteries that supply blood to the cerebellum, a part of the brain. Blockage of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery can result in a type of stroke called lateral medullary syndrome. Course It winds backward around the upper part of the medulla oblongata, passing between the origins of the vagus nerve and the accessory nerve, over the inferior cerebellar peduncle to the undersurface of the cerebellum, where it divides into two branches. The medial branch continues backward to the notch between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum; while the lateral supplies the under surface of the cerebellum, as far as its lateral border, where it anastomoses with the anterior inferior cerebellar and the superior cerebellar branches of the basilar artery. Branches from this artery supply the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle.

It was produced in 1973, but was only theatrically distributed in 1975. The film is set in Europe and stars actress Lina Romay as Irina von Karlstein, a vampire who has sex with both male and female victims. In an unusual variation of the vampire myth, Karlstein performs oral sex on her victims until they die, draining them of their sexual fluids. Three versions of the film were shot: straight horror, horror mixed with sex, and a hardcore pornography version. Franco's original title for the film was The Bare Breasted Countess, but it was released under many different titles over the years. To assuage Franco, the film was screened as The Bare Breasted Countess at the 2009 Fantastic Fest in the United States, which Franco attended as guest of honor. The film's title was later changed to Female Vampire for its DVD release. Plot The plot revolves around Countess Irina von Karlstein (Lina Romay), a mute woman who needs sex like a vampire needs blood in order to stay alive. Without speaking, the Countess is able to hypnotize victims and lure them into transfixed erotic acts. In addition, she is able to fly from the scene quickly due to her bat-changing abilities. When new victims are found fatally drained of potency, and left scattered around the town, forensic scientist Dr. Roberts consults his colleague, Dr. Orloff, who confirms that a vampire is responsible. A female journalist and few others meet with the Countess and confront her about her ties to vampires in her family. While the Countess tells the truth and admits that she is a vampire, few remain living to report the truth and warn other townspeople. The countess is also confronted by a psychic investigator who believes he is destined to become her lover and join her among the immortals. Production In director Jes√∫s Franco's productions from 1972 and onward, his films became more inclined towards themes involving female sex and zoom in shots on female genitalia.Shipka, 2011. p.208 After the death of Franco's previous preferred lead actress Soledad Miranda, he cast 19-year-old actress Lina Romay as the Countess Irina.Shipka, 2011. p.210 Romay was more open about her sexuality than Miranda, which allowed Franco to focus on his more sex-based themes in his films. Franco originally made three different versions of the film.... a straight vampire film called La comtesse noire (The Black Countess), a horror- oriented erotic film entitled La Comtesse aux seins nus (The Bare Breasted Countess), and the hardcore pornography version Les avaleuses (The Swallowers). These 3 versions ran at 72 minutes, 82 minutes, and 96 minutes respectively. Franco felt that The Bare Breasted Countess was an erotica film as opposed to a pornographic film. Franco compared the use of sex in his films to the film In the Realm of the Senses by Japanese director Nagisa Oshima whose film contained sex with social and political commentary. Franco compared his film to Oshima's, stating \\"there are lots of hardcore shots but nobody would say 'Oh, it's a porno film!' No. It's a very important story. I felt in [Female Vampire] I did the same thing. There was a need to show it, like you must show how Dracula sucks his blood, you need to show how this Countess sucks the semen.\\" Some scenes with the vampires were filmed twice....in the manner of a traditional vampire film and also in a much more graphic style. The film was edited by Franco and Ramon Ardid (Lina Romay's then-husband) under the combined pseudonym Pierre Querut. Release The film premiered in France under the title La Comtesse noire on May 7, 1975. Producers added hardcore pornography scenes to the film on some of its releases.Hawkins, 2000. p.96 The film has been released under several alternative English titles, including Yacula, Jacula, Bare-Breasted Vampire, The Bare Breasted Countess and Naked Vampire. The film was screened under the title The Bare Breasted Countess at the 2009 Fantastic Fest with Lina Romay and Franco in attendance (Franco's preferred title). Female Vampire was released by Image Entertainment on DVD on August 8, 2000. The film was re-released on DVD and blu-ray disc by Kino International. The Kino release includes both a 72-minute \\"horror version\\" and a 104-minute \\"erotic version\\". Reception From a contemporary review, David McGillivray (Monthly Film Bulletin), reviewing a 59-minute dubbed version of the film, stated the cuts have made a narratively complex film even more confusing, describing the film as \\"a fragment of a much longer film, although in this case the cuts have added a bizarre new level to a work already wrapped in mystery\\" The reviewer commented that \\"what exactly is going on, and what exactly Irina is doing to her victims, remains a mind-boggling conundrum\\", noting that \\"with the exception of the first encounter, she appears not to be doing anything at all.\\" From retrospective reviews, Kim Newman referred to the film as \\"One of Franco's better films\\" as well noting that for Franco's fanbase it is \\"a masterpiece; to everyone else, wearisome tat.\\" The online film database Allmovie gave the film one and a half stars out of five, but opined that the film \\"benefits from a haunting performance by Romay as the cursed vampire.\\" See also *List of Belgian films of the 1970s *List of French films of 1975 *List of horror films of 1975  References  =Footnotes= =Sources= * Hawkins, Joan.

The Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra can be traced back to the early 1930s during the throes of the Great Depression. The orchestra gave its first concert at William Penn High School in Harrisburg on March 19, 1931. The conductor on that occasion was Maestro George King Raudenbush, who was to become the orchestra‚Äôs first music director. By the end of 1931 the orchestra had moved its concerts to the newly opened Forum Auditorium, part of the Capitol Complex, where it still performs to this day. The 1931-32 season included four concerts. The cost of a subscription: $2.00. The orchestra membership consists of professional players from Central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, New York, and other regions. Being able to select from such a wide variety of talent pools enables the HSO to perform at a particularly high artistic level. The HSO membership is represented by American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 269, and the group is a member of ROPA, the Regional Orchestra Players' Association.

The area is to the south of Pinnacle Mountain, one of the highest elevations in Pulaski County. Like Chenal Valley which borders the area on its south side, Pinnacle Valley is a fast-developing portion of Little Rock as the city continues to expand westward. The neighborhood is anchored by Arkansas Highway 10 (which is officially signed as Cantrell Road on the portions that are inside Little Rock corporate limits), although most in the area refer to the path located west of an intersection with Interstate 430 simply as Highway 10. Minor developed areas including Pleasant Ridge and Walton Heights buffer Pinnacle Valley from the interstate on its eastern side. To the west and other directions lie unincorporated areas of Pulaski County. Development of Pinnacle Valley's commercial corridor along Highway 10 has increased specifically since 2000, with new office complexes and retail centers still under construction by the spring of 2006. Juxtaposed with the new construction is a small amount of existing homes from years prior to the area's annexation into Little Rock's city limits, including the formerly unincorporated community of Pankey. The area, which includes the Little Maumelle River, was subject to a major flood when the Arkansas River crested at 29.71 feet (nearly seven feet above flood stage) on the early morning of June 5, 2019. This is the fourth highest recorded level.

He is known for writing the popular song 'I Sing Praises', that has been a Top 40 Christian song around the world and is still regularly sung in many churches. The song was published by Integrity Music in 1989 and is included in many modern hymnals. He heads a worship music Christian ministry based in Frisco, Texas and travels leading worship in conferences, retreats, worship seminars, and churches throughout the United States, and internationally. As of 2019 MacAlmon has sold an estimated number of 2 million albums worldwide and has two gold albums. In 2010 he received the GMA UK Lifetime Achievement Award for Exceptional Contribution to worship music. In 2008 his Holy! was nominated for Instrumental Album of the Year at the 39th Annual Gospel Music Association Dove Awards.  Background  = Early years = At birth the doctor informed MacAlmon's parents that he would likely not live through his first month, due to Cranial Stenosis (a premature closure of the soft spot in his head). According to his mother, she was pacing the floor with him every day and praying, \\"Lord, if You let him live, I will give him to You for Your service.\\" Not long thereafter her baby healed, which MacAlmon ascribes to his mother's cry for help. MacAlmon believes that he not only received the gift of life at that time but also a special anointing and gift of music. At the age of three, MacAlmon's mother began sitting him on the piano bench to occupy him, while she looked after his brothers. Quickly he began to discover the notes of \\"Jesus Loves Me\\", a song he had learned in Sunday school. A steady progression took place. By the time he was five, he played his first solo in church. MacAlmon became the church pianist at the age of 11. Winning state and national talent awards in his denomination became a regular event during his teenage years. In mid-1973 MacAlmon claims to have had an unusual visitation from God, after an evening service at a youth retreat. He recalls, \\"It was as if God's presence was sitting on me like a cloud. His presence was so heavy that I physically could not even lift my head. I just knelt and trembled while His Spirit dealt with me. I knew that He was placing His mantle of worship upon me. I have never been the same since that special August night.\\" = Ministry startup = In the following 17 years, MacAlmon served in music ministry positions for several churches and traveled in concert work across America. After moving his family to Colorado Springs, in December 1990, MacAlmon started a church and soon fell upon hard times. Instead of a successful ministry venture, it became much less than that. It was the start of what MacAlmon calls 'a long season of wilderness'. Despite his efforts to start a church and to organize worship meetings, nobody showed up. After eight years of trying and waiting on what MacAlmon calls 'the Lord's promotion', he claims to have heard God speaking to him again, in August 1998. He recalls, \\"God said to gather the worshipers, for He wanted to bring an open heaven to Colorado Springs.\\" However, after so many years of seeing nothing happen, he was reluctant to step out again. Finally, he did launch a weekly noon worship hour on Wednesday's, which became known as \\"Lunch with the Lord\\". That turned out to be a success and the meetings were visited by several hundred people each week. = Worldwide publicity = In 2001 MacAlmon was contacted by tele- evangelist Benny Hinn, who invited him for one of his crusades in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hinn believed that God had raised MacAlmon to lead the church into a season of worship, or as he called it, 'a new era of worship'. During the event Hinn said that MacAlmon's songs were affecting his life, his ministry and his staff, claiming that each of his staff members had MacAlmon's albums. In the days following, the event was broadcast on Hinn's TV show, This is Your Day, which reached a worldwide audience. From that moment on, MacAlmon's album sales went up drastically and he started to receive invitations from all over the world. = New Glory International = In April 2010, MacAlmon founded New Glory International, which became his full-time ministry. At the end of that same year he also started to do international events. In the following decade, MacAlmon has traveled through the United States and all over the world, leading worship and teaching at conferences, retreats, worship seminars and churches of all kinds of different denominations, which he still does this present day. Since the start of New Glory International, MacAlmon has also published several new cd albums and a book. = Sing Over America = In the course of 2019, MacAlmon said he was searching God for his own nation, the United States. He said that God instructed him to gather the worshipers from coast to coast in Dallas, Texas, for a national worship gathering. At the end of 2019, MacAlmon founded a new ministry, next to New Glory International, which he called Sing Over America, after the eponymous event that he is organizing in May 2020. MacAlmon says he hopes that this will set a series of gatherings in motion throughout the U.S. During the first Sing Over America event in May 2020, MacAlmon was joined by famous singers and bands, such as Don Moen, Paul Wilbur, Gateway Worship, Nathaniel Bassey, Vocal Majority Joni Lamb, and The Daystar Singers.  Personal life  In May 2008, MacAlmon announced that he was stepping down from his own ministry after having an extramarital affair. After counseling, MacAlmon filed for divorce, which was finalized in April 2009. In April 2010, after two years of silence, MacAlmon came forward with a letter, announcing that he would return to ministry in May 2010, which resulted in the start of New Glory International. Early in 2010 MacAlmon met and began to date Liz Valentine of Daytona Beach, Florida. The couple were married in December of that year.

A DOF adapter could theoretically be used on a multitude of platforms, although it is most useful on prosumer digital camcorders where high resolution is a capability but the sensor size is still small enough to elicit use of the adapter. The term 35mm adapter is common, since most designs use a focusing screen the size of a 35mm film frame (24√ó36 mm) and interface with lenses designed for 35mm cameras. The use of adapters has decreased largely due to the video function available on newer DSLR cameras. How it works A DOF adapter focuses an image onto a translucent screen (similar to how one would look at a focused image through a system camera's viewfinder) located between an external lens and the camera's main lens. The camcorder is able to frame this intermediate screen by focusing in macro mode. The principle is similar to pointing a video camera at a movie screen. The lens attached to the adapter now takes the job of the camcorder's focusing and aperture mechanisms. The camcorder's only responsibility at this point is to record what is being projected onto the focusing screen (called back focus.) Limitations A DOF adapter comes with a few limitations. First is the inherent light loss that comes with attaching the unit to the front of the camera. Using any one of these adapters requires that the scene being shot by the camera be adequately lit. Static (non-moving) adapters suffer greater image degradation from low- light situations because texture on the focusing screen becomes more noticeable. The camcorder used in conjunction with the adapter must focus on the focusing screen inside the adapter which is used as a projection surface. As a result, the camcorder also picks up the pits, dimples and/or specks in the material that give it its translucent properties. The solution to this problem is to shake, rotate or otherwise move the focusing screen so that the texture of the screen is blurred. In a non-static solution such as this, the texture is only a problem at very high shutter speeds, where blurring is reduced. Vignetting, barrel distortion and chromatic aberration are also problems that are difficult to eradicate. The optics within the adapter must be of high quality and at the correct distance from each other in order to minimize these issues. Image orientation is also an issue. The adapter, like any other lens, flips the image upside-down. To help address this issue while filming, an external monitor such as a small LCD screen may be mounted upside down to view the image in its correct orientation. Some LCD screens feature both mirror and flip options that correctly orient the image (flip vertically and mirror horizontally). In either case, the actual recorded footage must still be rotated 180 degrees in post-production. The one exception to this is the option to mount the camera upside down. This will allow the camera to record an upright image. However the camera LCD will still flip the image, and an external LCD monitor is still required. Another option is to use a flip module. A flip module is yet another addition to 35mm adapter construction set that is made up of a series of mirrors or prisms that literally \\"flip\\" the image while shooting. This avoids the burden of needing an external LCD monitor, but at the cost of additional light loss. Many adapters already have a flip module within them, so the filmmakers do not have to worry about flipping the image in post-production. Construction Example construction of a DOF adapter using a static ground glass focusing screen A basic DOF adapter usually has four components: a macro lens, an optional plano-convex lens, a translucent focusing screen, and finally a photographic lens of the user's choice. On camcorders without sufficient macro capability, a macro lens, preferably an achromatic doublet (to minimize chromatic aberration), is usually attached directly to the camcorder so that the camcorder can zoom in and focus on the focusing screen. Without the macro lens, certain camcorders would be unable to zoom in well enough to frame the entire focusing screen and still achieve sharp focus. The optional plano-convex lens is used to avoid vignetting in the image. The focusing screen is where the photographic lens image is projected. The screen must be placed at precisely the correct distance from the flange focal mount of whatever lens is being used (most popularly the Canon FD or Nikon F mount), referred to as the flange back distance. Finally, the front lens is a photographic or cinema lens that projects the image desired onto the focusing screen. Price The price of a DOF adapter ranges from tens of thousands of US dollars for a professional solution to less than a hundred by using parts available from a local hardware store. The pricing of a DOF adapter unit also depends on the material and technologies used. For instance, a relay lens system must be added if the adapter is to be directly mounted to a camera's body (bypassing the standard lens, as if on a Canon XL1 or XL2 and the Sony EX3). Also, a prism system that is used on some adapters that correctly reorients the image rightside-up adds to the cost.

History The lighthouse was first built in 1855, as a wooden structure, but the breakwater was extended and a new lighthouse was constructed at the end of it in 1875. The new lighthouse was made of curved cast-iron plates whose seams are disguised by six decorative Corinthian columns. Its design was inspired by the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, made well known by engravings. The architect was Thomas U. Walter, most noted as the designer of the U.S. Capitol east and west wings and its current dome. Wooden sheds and a six-room house for the lighthouse-keeper were added incrementally as needed. In 1897 Spring Point Ledge Light was erected and the houses around Bug Light were demolished and the Spring Point Ledge Lighthouse keepers tended to both lighthouses. During World War II, the breakwater was slowly absorbed by landfill as the New England Shipbuilding Corporation built two shipyards next to the lighthouse. These shipyards produced Liberty Ships for the war effort. Because of the smaller breakwater, there was a lesser need for the lighthouse and it was decommissioned in 1943. Restoration The light was fully restored in 1989 and was reactivated in 2002. It appears as a private aid to navigation in the US Coast Guard Light List as South Portland Breakwater Light. Today a park named after the lighthouse, Bug Light Park, allows visitors to view the Portland Breakwater Light up close, while memorializing the shipbuilding efforts of World War II. The light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Portland Breakwater Light on June 19, 1973, reference number 73000238.

He is currently the Jack E. McLaughlin Distinguished University Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan. Education Hochster attended Stuyvesant High School, where he was captain of the Math Team, and received a B.A. from Harvard University. While at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow in 1960. He earned his Ph.D. in 1967 from Princeton University, where he wrote a dissertation under Goro Shimura characterizing the prime spectra of commutative rings. Career He held positions at the University of Minnesota and Purdue University before joining the faculty at Michigan in 1977. Hochster's work is primarily in commutative algebra, especially the study of modules over local rings. He has established classic theorems concerning Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay rings, invariant theory and homological algebra. For example, the Hochster‚ÄìRoberts theorem states that the invariant ring of a linearly reductive group acting on a regular ring is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay. His best-known work is on the homological conjectures, many of which he established for local rings containing a field, thanks to his proof of the existence of big Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay modules and his technique of reduction to prime characteristic. His most recent work on tight closure, introduced in 1986 with Craig Huneke, has found unexpected applications throughout commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. He has had more than 40 doctoral students, and the Association for Women in Mathematics has pointed out his outstanding role in mentoring women students pursuing a career in mathematics. He served as the chair of the department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan from 2008 to 2017. Awards Hochster shared the 1980 Cole Prize with Michael Aschbacher, received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981, and has been a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1992.

Plot In the year 1998, after the death of his mother, 13-year-old Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Cooper takes it upon himself to take care of his single father Nick and little sister Angie in Monroe County, New York. Ben enters a contest to win a smart house. The family wins and moves into the house (run by a virtual assistant named PAT, short for \\"Personal Applied Technology\\") and is introduced to its creator, Sara Barnes. Nick and Sara begin dating, which upsets Ben, who has not moved on from the death of his mother. Ben decides to reprogram PAT to serve as a maternal figure, and the computer uses its learning capabilities to emulate mothers from 1950s-era TV shows and films. Ben and Angie have a party while Nick and Sara are on a date. With PAT's help, Ben wins over his crush Gwen Patroni, and his bully Ryan is shown up by PAT, who electrically shocks Ryan, haunts him with ghostly skull holograms and chases him out of the house. PAT helps them clean up to cover up evidence of the party, but Nick figures it out anyway, and reprimands Ben and Angie when he finds Gwen's sweater (thrown about during a dance line) in the living room fern. Nick chastises PAT for throwing a party behind his back, asking her to be more responsible with his children. PAT's \\"mother\\" personality starts to become more strict and overbearing. Sara shuts down the entire system and joins the family for dinner, but upon hearing Nick offhandedly suggesting she's not needed, PAT overrides the system shutdown and brings herself back online. An angry and jealous PAT generates herself as a holographic housewife, styled like the sitcom housewives Ben taught her to behave as; she kicks Sara out, seeing her as a threat to PAT's place in the family, and locks the Coopers in the house, asserting that the outside world is too dangerous. Sara manages to make contact with Ben and sneaks into the house, but she becomes trapped with the Cooper family. Ben is able to end the lock-down by telling PAT that she isn't real and will never be human. PAT finally unlocks the doors and windows, freeing them, and shuts herself down. Sara is able to restore PAT's original personality, but PAT retains some mischievousness. Sara and Nick start dating, and Nick spends more time with his family. Ben finally accepts Sara after realizing she was never trying to replace his mother, and, with PAT's help, is able to have time for friends and hobbies again.

And that after all, that was what Pat was all about.\\" Reception In December 2015, Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly ranked Smart House at number one on a list of the top 30 Disney Channel Original Movies. Bacle wrote, \\"What earns the movie this top spot on the list is its combination of sob-worthy emotion ‚Äî that scene where Ben (Ryan Merriman) revisits home videos of his late mom continues to be one of the most moving moments to air on the Disney Channel ‚Äî and light-hearted glee [...]. Plus, Katey Sagal's turn as the good-gone-evil-gone-good resident hologram is nothing short of iconic.\\" In May 2016, Aubrey Page of Collider ranked each Disney Channel Original Movie released up to that point.

It was once one of the largest tractor manufacturing enterprises in the USSR. It was a site of fierce fighting during World War II's Battle of Stalingrad. During its lifetime, VgTZ has supplied more than 2.5 million tractors to the farming industry, making a huge contribution to the mechanization of agriculture. VgTZ tractors operate in 32 countries throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and Latin America. Also used for the production of military vehicles, VgTZ is inextricably linked with the history of Soviet tank building. The plant continues to operate on a small scale, but much of it is now derelict or has been demolished. History Until 1961, the plant was called the Stalingrad Tractor Plant named for F. Dzerzhinsky (, Stalingradski traktorni zavod im. F.E. Dzerzhinskogo, or , STZ). It was one of the first industrial facilities to be built as part of the planned rapid industrialization of the USSR, which was adopted in the late 1920s. The foundation stone was laid in a groundbreaking ceremony on July 12, 1926. Stalingrad Tractor Plant in the 1930s Construction of the plant was carried out with the involvement of experts from Western countries, primarily the United States. It was designed by Albert Kahn Associates Inc., the company started by famous American architect Albert Kahn. In 1928, a group of Soviet engineers visited Kahn's office with an order for designing and building the Stalingrad Tractor Plant, and in April 1929, the Soviet trade representative Saul Bron signed the contract with Albert Kahn. The full value of the contract, including equipment, was US$30 million, which would equate to about US$450 million in today's money. Once the contract was agreed, design and construction of the plant proceeded without delay, and the entire facility was installed within a period of six months under the supervision of American engineers. The steel structures were manufactured in New York by the McClintic-Marshall Company, and then transported to Stalingrad for field assembly. The huge flow of cargo was shipped via the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and Black Sea, then along the Volga river and over land to the place of construction. The plant was kitted out with equipment from more than eighty US engineering companies and several German firms. The new factory was officially opened on June 17, 1930, and the first tractor to begin production on the assembly line was the 15-30, manufactured in the USA by the McCormick Deering company; in the USSR, it became known as the 15/30 STZ (or STZ-1). By April 1932, the Stalingrad Tractor Plant was working at full capacity, with 144 tractors a day rolling off the conveyor. Factory ruins in November 1942 Tank production began in 1932 with the launch of the T-26 light infantry tank, which was easy to manufacture and operate, and considered to be more reliable than foreign equivalents. In 1939, the first automated machine tool line in the USSR was designed and commissioned at the Volgograd Tractor Plant on the initiative of I. P. Inochkina, a design engineer who worked at the plant for 35 years. By the end of the 1940s, dozens of such lines were in operation at bearing and automotive plants. By the time war broke out in September 1939, the tractor plant had produced a quarter of a million standard tractors as well as 40,000 tracked versions. During World War II, the plant was retooled to produce military equipment and weapons for the Soviet Red Army, most notably the T-34 tank. The plant became world-famous during the Battle of Stalingrad. When the German Wehrmacht reached the city in the summer of 1942, the tractor plant was their first target, and it was largely destroyed during the fierce fighting that ensued over the next few months. Once the hostilities had ended with the final victory in February 1943, the site was cleared of shells and debris so that restoration work could begin immediately. Full-scale production resumed at the plant within months of the city being liberated. Decline and regeneration In 1992, the Volgograd Tractor Plant became a private joint-stock company, and entered a period of economic uncertainty with a decline in productivity. The company was floated on the public stock market in 1995 and became an OJSC. By the late 1990s, the plant was producing fewer than 3,000 tractors per year. In December 2002, following rising debts and many changes in ownership, OJSC Volgograd Tractor Plant was divided into four separate business units within the group: *OJSC Tractor Company VgTZ (Traktornaya kompaniya VgTZ) *OJSC Russian Engineering Components (Rossiyskiye mashinostroitel'nyye komponenty) *OJSC Territory of Industrial Development (Territoriya promyshlennogo raszvitiya) *OJSC Volgograd Tractor Plant (Volgogradski traktorni zavod) Responsibility for military technology projects was allocated to a separate concern, the Volgograd Machine Building Company VgTZ (Volgogradskaya mashinostroitel'naya kompaniya VgTZ), which was not connected to the \\"Volgograd Tractor Plant\\" group of companies. In 2003, the OJSC Volgograd Tractor Plant group became part of OJSC Agromashholding, which specializes in the production, sale and service of agricultural, municipal and industrial equipment. The OJSC Volgograd Tractor subdivision of the group was declared bankrupt in 2005. Then in 2006, OJSC Tractor Company VgTZ was acquired by the non-commercial partnership Concern Tractor Plants, a leading Russian machine building company, of which OJSC Agromashholding is an agricultural division. VgTZ thrived under its new owners, and achieved a stable monthly performance for the whole of 2006, with almost 3,000 tracked tractors leaving the conveyor, including 768 of the promising VT series and 1,290 tractors with industrial modifications. The OJSC Tractor Company VgTZ subdivision eventually ceased tractor production altogether in November 2015. In April 2017, the Russian Deputy Minister of Defense, Yury Borisov, visited OJSC Volgograd Tractor Plant to check on progress of the State Defense Order for new military vehicles. According to Borisov, the company was experiencing financial difficulties at the time. A decision was taken to merge the military side of the concern with the state-owned holding company Rostec, in order to stabilize the plant's financial position. The separate Volgograd Machine Building Company, which is still based at the plant, continues to manufacture Sprut- SDM1 self-propelled anti-tank guns and BMD-4M airborne combat vehicles for the Russian Airborne Troops. In the spring of 2019, reconstruction work began on the ruins of the tractor plant, with plans to regenerate the area into a multipurpose center, including shops, office buildings, and apartments. All that remains of the VgTZ works is a series of walk-through plants and two monuments in the square. The workshops have been demolished and the new owner rents the former factory management premises as office space. There is a small museum dedicated to the rich history of the Volgograd Tractor Plant. The northern terminus station on the Volgograd Metrotram still bears the name Traktornyy Zavod (\\"Tractor Factory\\").

The film stars Trevor Morgan and Emmy Rossum, and premiered on Disney Channel on August 21, 1999. In the film, Morgan portrays a genius who enrolls in college at the age of 13 and takes on a bad boy image in an attempt to gain friends. Plot summary Charlie Boyle, a 13-year-old physics genius and hockey lover, enrolls in a Wisconsin college so he can work with Dr. Krickstein, a scientist he admires. Mostly Charlie is sick of being a geek and he was treated like dirt because he was a genius. For years, Krickstein has been studying gravity in an attempt to defy it. Krickstein's laboratory is located underneath the college's hockey arena. Charlie has difficulty making friends with his college students and roommates. Charlie meets a teenage girl named Claire Addison, who attends a local high school. To be near Claire, Charlie tells her that he is a new student at her school, and that his name is Chaz Anthony. Charlie chooses to reinvent himself because he feels being a nerd does not guarantee him a girlfriend. Charlie enrolls at Claire's school as Chaz, and takes on a bad boy image in an attempt to be cool and gain friends. To get closer to Claire, Chaz convinces her to tutor him. Claire is the daughter of Coach Addison, who coaches the college's Northern Lights hockey team. Charlie realizes that living two lives can be difficult. Eventually, Charlie's double life is exposed at the college's conference championship, when Claire's father identifies him as Charlie Boyle. Claire confronts Charlie, who admits the truth. Charlie realizes that he left the laboratory's particle accelerator running; it overheats, cracking the ice and interrupting the game which the Northern Lights were about to win, having used advice Charlie gave them. Coach Addison's job is put in jeopardy as a result and Claire, disgusted by Charlie's actions, tells him she never wants to see him again and refuses to take his phone calls. Charlie leaves junior high school and although he makes an announcement over the PA system apologizing, Claire and his best friends Odie and Dieon refuse to forgive him. Having isolated a graviton and figuring out how to use it to control the movements of another object, Charlie decides to use it to help the hockey team cheat and win against the other team and its own cheating tactics. Charlie appeals to his friends for help. They refuse until, after being called Chaz by Claire, he tells them he is Charlie Boyle and he cannot do it without them. Odie and Dieon decide to help and finally Claire and his other junior high classmates follow. After creating a distraction with the help of his classmates to get microchips onto the three main enemy players, Charlie and Claire proceed to take control of them to prevent them from cheating. Dr. Krickstein initially refuses to have anything to do with Charlie's decision to use science for cheating, but later steps in to help and accidentally causes an electrical surge that reverses the polarity of the graviton, causing Charlie, Claire and Krickstein, as well as the players they are connected to, to defy gravity. The Northern Lights win and Coach Addison's job is saved. Charlie and Claire kiss and start dating. Later, Charlie and his friends set up a friendly ice hockey game with Krickstein joining, but before they can start, the Northern Lights arrive with Charlie's college roommate and friend Mike, having learned what Charlie did for them from Claire's father, who Claire told. The Northern Lights ask for a game against Charlie and his friends. Charlie agrees, but on the condition that Krickstein is on their team, to which they reluctantly agree.

It was released on October 9, 1999 as a Disney Channel Original Movie (DCOM). Plot Frances Bacon McCausland (Erin Chambers), an intelligent and level-headed girl, is starting high school a year early. Strange things have been going on in her town of Middleberg: dogs appearing on people's roofs, alarm clocks going off hours early, eggs all over a teacher's car, gelatin in the school swimming pool, and the letter \\"B\\" spray-painted all over town. The Bs also appear on the school lockers‚Äîexcept for Frances', which has a B on the inside. These pranks seem to point to Frances, who does not understand what is happening or why. An older boy named Larry Houdini (Eric \\"Ty\\" Hodges II) offers to help Frances, telling her that he is an imaginary friend, which is proven true as children are the only other people who can see him. Larry tells Frances that she is being framed by the Boogeyman. Frances has a difficult time believing this. The Boogeyman causes a blackout, foreshadowed by the Bs he spray-painted; however, the McCausland home is unaffected, with all its Christmas lights remaining on. Frances then loses her friendship with her best friend Joanne, makes a fool out of herself trying to convince others that Larry exists, and causes her family to question her sanity. At her wits end, Frances checks out The Boogey Book from the library for Larry, who decides to build a tetra-fuse detailed in the book which will age the Boogeyman into a harmless old geezer. Frances later learns Larry was her brother Darwin's imaginary friend, who still cares about him, but Frances convinced Darwin to grow up and stop believing in him. Larry also cooks up Boogey Goo to use as bait and finds it delicious, which scares Frances. She looks for Boogeyman origins in the book, learning that a Boogeyman is created when the creator of an imaginary friend stops believing too soon. Having accidentally stepped in Boogey Goo, Darwin attracts the Boogeyman and gets kidnapped while sitting in Frances' room. Frances and Larry follow him to the Boogeyworld dimension, which exists underneath Frances' bed. During the skirmish, Larry turns into a Boogeyman due to Darwin's lack of belief in him, while the other Boogeyman drags Darwin towards a cliff. However, Frances convinces Darwin to believe in Larry again, reverting him to normal. After using the tetra-fuse on the Boogeyman, Frances realizes it is her old imaginary friend, Zoe. Frances stopped believing in her when Darwin fell ill, deciding it was time to grow up. Frances proves she still cares about Zoe, holding her hand and causing her to revert to normal. Frances and Darwin return to the real world, where her parents reveal the same antics that occurred in Middleburg are occurring in another city. Larry reveals that \\"the guy in his head\\" just ordered him to go take care of the other Boogeyman; Zoe offers to assist as she was rather inexperienced as a Boogeyman and was thus easy to fight. Frances is distraught as it was not easy for her to believe in them again. Before Larry and Zoe leave, Larry tells Frances its alright showing her that childhood was great, but so is adulthood if she keeps a sense of wonder. He then turns on the Christmas lights outside, allowing him and Zoe to leave. That night, Darwin is scared and is sent to Frances by Larry; she allows him to sleep with her. Larry and Zoe watch this with smiles.

Production Filming took place in Utah, in 1999. The Boogeyman's world consisted of a set that was custom-built in Salt Lake City, and scenes set at Frances' school were shot at a high school in Ogden, Utah. The Boogeyman was originally scarier in early concept drawings. According to the film's director, Kenneth Johnson, the character \\"was really dark and [had] quills sticking out. It was nightmarish. I said, 'Why don't we take him more Victorian and let's have his dialogue be limerick-like and make it a little bit lighter.\\" Eric \\"Ty\\" Hodges II, a black actor, portrayed Larry, who was not written as a black character in the script. According to Johnson, Disney was concerned about \\"having a black boy kiss a white girl\\" at the film's ending, stating, \\"They asked me to do it a couple of different ways, including not really at all. I fought for it.\\" Disney ultimately allowed the kiss scene to stay in the film, and Johnson said the scene \\"is exactly the way I had always intended to do it.\\" In the film's original script, the ending involved Frances and Larry using the tetra-fuse to get rid of the Boogeyman, but Johnson stated that the ending was changed so Frances would defeat the Boogeyman herself. Release and reception Don't Look Under the Bed premiered on Disney Channel on October 9, 1999. It was the second DCOM to receive a TV-PG rating, due to its scary scenes. According to Johnson, \\"There were a number of meetings where we'd talked about the tone and what [Disney] wanted it to be ‚Äî scary but not too scary. That's the bar we kept trying to find. Everybody thought we had hit it until they started getting derogatory mail after it aired.\\" Disney Channel ultimately stopped airing the film at the request of parents who thought it was too scary. It is now available for streaming on Disney+ In 2012, Complex ranked the film at number 19 on the magazine's list of the 25 best DCOMs. In May 2016, Aubrey Page of Collider ranked each DCOM released up to that point, placing Don't Look Under the Bed at number 20 and writing that the film \\"remains in the DCOM history books for one reason: it's scary as hell.\\" That month, Entertainment Weekly ranked the film at number 27 on a list of the 30 best DCOMs. The horror blog A Boos/Booze Situation praised how the film allowed young viewers to explore the anxiety of turning into the very adults they fear. It cites the moment when Larry realizes that he's turning into a Boogeyman by stating that he \\"looks down at his hands in shock as he sees that his nails are now long and sharp. That moment of terrified reflection mirrors the moment when we realize we‚Äôve become the temperamental, illogical adult we always feared.\\" References External links 1999 horror films 1999 television films 1999 films 1990s fantasy films 1990s psychological thriller films 1990s teen horror films 1990s children's fantasy films American films Disney Channel Original Movie films Films shot in Utah American supernatural horror films Films directed by Kenneth Johnson (producer) Films scored by Daniel Licht ","title":"Don't Look Under the Bed"},{"id":"3520817","text":"The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA) is a representative body that advocates for the interests of tertiary students in New Zealand. Between 1935 and 2006, it was known as the New Zealand University Students' Association, until it merged with the national polytechnic students' association. History The organisation was founded in 1929 as the New Zealand National Union of Students, and initially focussed its activities on sporting and social concerns. It changed its name to the New Zealand University Students' Association in 1935, and over time gave greater focus to issues concerning student welfare, such as student access to healthcare. It developed a strong involvement in social issues during the 1960s and 1970s, opposing the Vietnam War, apartheid, and racial immigration policies, as well as supporting homosexual law reform. The association has a long history of advocating for its members by opposing NZ Government policies it viewed as not in the interests of students. During the 1990s and 2000s the New Zealand government and New Zealand universities made large increases in fees for students, and limited access to allowances for study. These changes attracted much criticism from the NZUSA. In the 2005 New Zealand general election the organisation strongly advocated in favour of policies it long held. These include reduction of student debt, and universal access to student allowances for full-time students. Such policy was supported by many minor parties, including the Greens, New Zealand First and United Future. The Fifth Labour Government introduced 0% interest on student loans policy, but the organisation continues to campaign against decreasing access to student allowances and systemic fee increases. NZUSA campaigned against the introduction of voluntary student membership (VSM), arguing that students did support compulsory membership of students' associations. NZUSA proposed a policy compromise, suggesting a \\"KiwiSaver style\\" opt-out arrangement where students would be members unless they explicitly said they did not want to be. Although NZUSA had campaigned against VSM for fifteen years, in 2012 all students' associations were required to be voluntary. =Historical achievements= ;NZUSA Lobby Gains * 1988 allowances were themselves the result of 1985-1988 lobbying with officials * In 1992 alone NZUSA achieved $10 million in benefits for students by getting Community Service Cards for all students in face of Ministerial opposition * Prevented student loan repayments being applied to all jobs attracting secondary tax * 2000: Freeze on fees * 2010: Restrictions on increases in CSSFs * 2012: Collaborative partnership for utilizing the Student Voice ;Gains though engagement * 2000: Review of loan scheme massively improves student experience and efficiency of delivery * 1929 - 2013: Constant involvement with government over regulations and procedures * 1996-2000: Students added to CUAP (committee of university academic programmes), AAU (academic audit unit), TEC Board and Learners' Advisory Committee * Expansion of the categories covered by the Ministerial Direction in 2011 and defending that in December 2012 * 2012: enthusiastic support for learner panels and best practice Student Voice principles project ;Gains though elections * 1999: Education number two issue; change of government * 2005: Interest-free loans policy assists re-election of Labour Government * 2008: Interest-free loans adopted as National Party policy * 2011: Labour Party commits to universal allowance policy (joining Greens) ;Held VSM off for 15 years Activists from other associations assisted in all of these campaigns. * 1996: Michael Laws VSM Bill is defeated in the Select Committee process * 1998: VSM Bill converted from imposing individual membership to requiring referendums * 2000: WSU returns to universal membership through a student vote * 2001: AuSM, WITSA and SAWIT return to universal membership * 2006: USU returns to universal membership ;Wins for the tertiary sector * 1989: prevented a privatised loan-scheme by scaring off the banks * 1994: Todd Taskforce plan for increasing fees from $1500 to $7000 per year defeated * 1999: White Paper proposing privatization dropped by National Government after massive student protests * 2003: Introduction of fee maxima * 2009: National Party also adopts fee maxima policy * 2011: 120 of 121 MPs from parties supporting interest-free student loan policy =NZUSA after Voluntary Student Membership= A protest against Voluntary Student Membership in Wellington in December 2010 Since the introduction of voluntary student membership (VSM) in 2012, NZUSA has faced significant challenges. VSM led to the organisation no longer being guaranteed a revenue stream from member associations, and by 2012 its funding had decreased by a third as members cut their contributions due to financial hardship. Withdrawal of association memberships In August 2013, Waikato Students' Union announced that it would \\"temporarily withdraw\\" from NZUSA. In response, Auckland University Students' Association (AUSA), Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association (VUWSA) Otago University Students' Association (OUSA) put out a press release calling for significant reforms of NZUSA. Subsequently referendums were held at OUSA and VUWSA as to whether they should stay members of the national union. The membership of both unions voted to stay part of the organisation, but the presidents at the respective organisations have promised substantial reforms. In September 2014, VUWSA President Sonya Clark announced that after a unanimous vote by the executive, VUWSA would be withdrawing from the organisation (and had given its obligatory one-year notice of withdrawal). President Clark said: In response, NZUSA President Daniel Haines said he was In November 2014, OUSA announced that it would also be withdrawing from NZUSA. Postgraduate Officer Kurt Purdon said NZUSA missed the opportunity to prove themselves in 2014, but instead of proving themselves, OUSA President Ruby Sycamore-Smith had single handedly done more for Otago students than NZUSA. He further said: \\"We lose credibility by being a part of them.

(NZUSA argued that membership fees were still payable because VUWSA was in the 12-months-long withdrawal period.) The reversal came after NZUSA President Rory McCourt had waged a public campaign to get VUWSA to both reconsider its withdrawal from NZUSA and also to pay the fees outstanding. Victoria University students voted in late 2015 in a referendum to have VUWSA rejoin the national union.

The monastery belongs to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate).[https://www.unian.info/m/society/10965947-ukraine-s-police- open-criminal-cases-over-lockdown-violations-by-moscow-patriarchate-church- members.html Ukraine's police open criminal cases over lockdown violations by Moscow Patriarchate church members, UNIAN (20 April 2020) For centuries, it has been the foremost spiritual and ideological centre of various Orthodox denominations in Western Ukraine. The monastery tops a 60-metre hill in the town of Pochayiv, 18 km southwest of Kremenets and 70 km north of Ternopil. General view of the Pochayiv Lavra History = Origins = A first record of the monastery in Pochayiv dates back to 1527, although a local tradition claims that it was established three centuries earlier, during the Mongol invasion, by several runaway monks, either from the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves or from the Holy Mount Athos. The legend has it that the Theotokos appeared to the monks in the shape of a column of fire, leaving her footprint in the rock she stood upon.About the footprint of the Virgin Nikolai Leskov wrote: ‚ÄûNo any distinct resemblance of a human footprint here is noticeable, but one can see, firstly, the darkish surface of a solid stone of granite rock, in several places as if cracked, and in the middle of its area there is a significant oblong cavity, in the shape of a shell narrow but long, like a plate for fish.

In the 16th century, the abbey was prosperous enough to commission a stone cathedral and to host a busy annual fair. Its standing was further augmented in 1597, when a noble lady, Anna Hoyska, presented to the monastery her extensive lands and a miracle-working icon of the Theotokos. This image, traditionally known as Our Lady of Pochayiv, was given to Hojska by a passer-by Bulgarian bishop, and helped to cure her brother from blindness. =St Job of Pochayiv= In 1604, the monastic community was joined by Ivan Zalizo, a well-known champion of Eastern Orthodoxy in union with the then newly recognised Muscovite patriarchate Russian Orthodox Church and was a vocal critic of the Union of Brest. Formerly associated with the printing house of Prince Ostrogski, Zalizo established a press in Pochayiv in 1630, which supplied all of Galicia and Volhynia with Ruthenians Orthodox theological literature. The press continued to function until 1924, when it was taken first to Czechoslovakia, then to Munich, and then, in 1946, to the Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York. Zalizo received the monastic name of Job and was elected the monastery's hegumen. Job introduced strict discipline and other reforms of monastic life. During his time in office, the monastery had to fend off incessant attacks by Hoyska's heirs, notably Andrzej Firlej, Castellan of Belz, who sued the monks over his grandmother's bequest. In 1623, Firlej raided the monastery, taking the holy icon with him and keeping it until 1641, when a court decision finally returned the icon to the monks. Job of Pochayiv died on 25 October 1651 and was glorified as a saint soon thereafter. =In union with Rome= View of Pochaiv in the early 1800s During the Zbarazh War of 1675, the cloister was besieged by the Turkish Army, who reputedly fled upon seeing the apparition of the Theotokos accompanied with angels and St Job. Numerous Turkish Muslims that witnessed the event during the siege converted to Christianity afterward. One of the monastery chapels commemorates this event. According to some sources, Feofan Prokopovich, a Ruthenian reformer of the Russian Orthodox Church, took monastic vows in Pochayiv; he subsequently visited the monastery with his sovereign, Peter the Great, in 1712. After 1720, when the monastery was given to Greek Catholic Basilian monks. The process was reversed due to a seemingly miraculous occurrence. In 1759, a coach of Count Miko≈Çaj Bazyli Potocki capsized near the monastery walls. In a fit of anger, Potocki fired at his driver three times, all without avail. Attributing this failure to the divine intercession, Potocki settled in Pochayiv and started to lavish gifts upon the cloister. In 1773, Potocki (who was originally a Roman Catholic, and later became Greco-Catholic) petitioned the Pope to recognize the Pochayiv icon as miraculous and St Job as a Catholic saint. Only the former petition was accepted. Upon Potocki's death in 1782, he was interred at the Assumption Cathedral whose construction he had subsidized. =Between Poland and Russia= The Virgin of Pochaiv, 1840. Ivan Honchar Museum. In 1795 in result of the Third Partition of Poland, Volhynia became a part of the Russian Empire. Although a reversion of Greek Catholics to Russian Orthodoxy began, the Russian Imperial authorities did not immediately push this to confiscate the property of those who chose not to do so. Moreover, the typography and religious schools in the monastery continued to use Latin whilst the main language of communication was Polish. Nevertheless, the first Russophilic tendencies demonstrated themselves at that time. Within thirty years of the division of Poland, the Orthodox Bishop of Volhynia, Stephan wrote to Emperor Alexander I seeking to have the Pochayiv Monastery turned over to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1823, but his request was initially overruled. However it was only nine years later, in 1831, after the Greek- Catholic support for the November Uprising, that Nicholas I of Russia ordered the cloister be given to the adherents of the Russian Orthodox Church; the monastery was reconsecrated as an Orthodox entity under the communion of the Moscovite Patriarchy on 10 October of that year (thereby ending 110 years of Greek-Catholic monastic life). Two years later, in 1833, the monastery was accorded the status of lavra and became the summer residence for the Russian Orthodox bishops of Volhynia. Towards the end of the 19th century, Pochayiv became a mecca of Orthodox pilgrims from across the Russian empire and the Balkans. Its politically symbolic image as a western forepost of imperial Orthodoxy (being only several kilometres from the Greek-Catholics in Austrian- ruled Galicia) was widely used in propagating Pan-slavism. During the first days of World War I, thousands of Galician Ukrainians paid pilgrimage to the Lavra and some converted to Russian Orthodoxy, after the Russian imperial forces had swept over much of Galicia Battle of Galicia - some of the Slav elements in the Austro-Hungarian armies surrendering to the Russians (cf. Russian occupation of Eastern Galicia, 1914‚Äì1915). In 1915 the Lavra, along with the whole of Volhynia, became a front-line between Austria and Russia Great Retreat (Russian). However the looting by the Austrians in 1915 was just the start of its long journey into the 20th century. After the Russian October Revolution of 1917, another looting by Bolsheviks, the short-lived Ukrainian movements, and the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War in 1920, western Volhynia was transferred to Poland under the terms of the Peace of Riga. In 1921 the Lavra found itself on a crisis state with little food and much physical damage caused by nearly a decade of unrest. The most worrying factor for the monks however, was the ecclesiastical link to whom it should submit. Like most Russian Orthodox communities that found themselves outside the USSR, and thus outside any possible ecclesiastical control from the persecuted Russian Orthodox Church, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople agreed to take over Moscow's role and the Lavra became part of the Polish Orthodox Church in 1923. Until the end of the 1920s the Lavra was a peaceful place and repaired many of its damaged buildings. It was the first complete monastery to have its own electricity. In 1929 after the Polish Republican decree on the protection of Ruthenians ceased the Roman Catholic Church immediately began to exploit this. The Lavra received more than a hundred accusations against it and demanding the Orthodox to transfer the cloister. Despite numerous allegations, the Lavra survived them all and in process once again became the most visible Orthodox centre in the Second Polish Republic. =Recent history= Pochayiv Lavra had an indirect influence on Orthodoxy in the West. Archimandrite Vitaly (Maximenko), the director of the monastery‚Äôs printshop, evacuated the monastery‚Äôs printshop following the Russian Revolution. He then fled to Czechoslovakia, where he started a new brotherhood and resumed publishing. This new St. Job of Pochaev Brotherhood moved from Czechoslovakia to Germany and eventually America, where it joined the Holy Trinity Monastery near Jordanville, New York, with now-Archbishop Vitaly becoming its abbot. Holy Trinity Monastery thus carried on the publishing legacy of St. Job of Pochaev. In 1939, under the terms of Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's Secret protocol, Western Volhynia was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR. Part of the local population viewed it, at least initially, as a form of liberation from Polish rule. However the Soviet governments' anti-religious stance became the new source of oppression, although the Ukrainian form of this persecution was somewhat less rigid than in that of the Russian lands in the early 1920s. The Lavra self- transferred to the Moscow Patriarchy, during this time thousands of Orthodox pilgrims, from all over the USSR, at their own risk, took the chance to pay a visit to the cloister that they feared would share the fate that of all others in the USSR. It was not to be, although the Lavra was thoroughly searched, the monastic livestock, orphanage and other communal services which it provided to the local community were promptly confiscated, the sheer numbers of visitors prevented the Soviets taking immediate action against a place that once again had become a refuge for Orthodoxy. When Nazi Germany invaded the USSR on 22 June 1941, the Germans did not close the Lavra, but they did confiscate all that the Soviets could not get their hands on. During this time the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was formed. The Germans supported that church and forcefully transferred some of the Orthodox property to it. However, the Pochayiv Lavra refused to follow, what it called, a schism. Instead, in 1941 it became the center of the \\"Autonomist\\" movement, which claimed jurisdictional subordination to Moscow while at the same time being free to act independently of Moscow so long as the Moscow Patriarch was under Soviet control.Paul Robert Magocsi. (1996). A History of Ukraine. Toronto: University of Toronto Press: pp. 628-629. During the WWII the Soviet policy toward religion completely seemingly changed. Reestablishing the patriarchy, the Russian Orthodox church (MP) took a strong pro-soviet position against the Nazis and participated in the resistance on territories under Nazis. Whilst being a very visible centre of Orthodoxy prevented the Lavra taking such an active role as it potentially could, nevertheless it did provide refuge to the local population from Nazi persecution. In August 1944 the Red Army liberated Volhynia and this time the soldiers bowed to its mighty walls. Following the war, the Lavra was situated on a territory which contained the largest concentration of Orthodox parishes in the USSR. Its position of a forepost of state-sponsored Russian Orthodoxy in western Ukraine was even more reinforced in 1948 after the Soviet state-organised Synod of Lviv, which terminated the Union of Brest and forcibly disbanded Greek Catholicism in Eastern Galicia by converting them to Russian Orthodoxy. However the post-war permissive attitude towards religion in the Soviet Union promptly ended with the new Thaw policy of Nikita Khrushchev in the late 1950s. During this time the Lavra came under extensive pressure from the Soviet government, subjected to regular raids and searches as well as constant monitoring. A museum of atheism was opened in one of the confiscated church buildings in 1959. Yet despite this pressure the Lavra survived closure, and by the end of the 1970s was the main theological centre of Moscow Patriarchy's Ukrainian Exarchate in the Russian Orthodox Church. In the late 1980s after the Soviet Union relaxed its restrictions on religion, the former Museum of Atheism was closed and was first turned into a theological school, which in turn became a seminary in 1991. Also at the same time the Byzantine Church, in Union with the Holy See of Rome, now the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, was revived, as was the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The Lavra's community unanimously declined any sympathy to these newly restored communions, attributing their action partly to some of the more violent methods that were employed, aided by nationalist paramilitaries, against the parishes of Moscow's Russian Orthodox Church. In opposition a pro-Moscovite Cossack regiment was formed to safeguard Russian Orthodox parishes. Because the Lavra's rerise from Soviet persecution coincided with these events, its politico-historical position as a forepost of state-supported Moscovite Russian Orthodoxy in Western Ukraine was once again unveiled. Its militant Cossacks prevented seizure of Orthodox communities in Volhynia and in Ukraine by the Greek Catholic or Ukrainian Kyiv Patriarchate jurisdictions (the ambiguous position of Greek Catholic churches and property seized for the Muscovite Russian Orthodoxy remained unsettled.Geraldine Fagan, Aleksandr Shchipkov. \\"The Ukrainian Greek Catholics in an Ambiguous Position\\".

In April 2015 deputies of the Ternopil regional council voted for transfer of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra to the state.\\"The Pochayiv Lavrain the Ukraine may be transferred to the State\\", Pravoslavie, 29 April 2015 Saint Amphilochius of Pochayiv Holy icon of the Theotokos of Pochaiv, set in the golden diadem presented by Pope Clement XIV. On 12 May 2002, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church canonized schema monk Amphilochius (Amfilohiy) of Pochayiv. Amphilochius of Pochayiv (in world Yakiv Holovatyuk 1894 - 1971) was born on 27 November 1894 in the village Mala Ilovytsya, in Shumsk raion of Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine. In 1925 he became a monk and joined the community of Pochayiv Lavra. In 1936, Amphilochius had been given the rank of hieromonk (priest-monk). His healing gifts attracted the attention of many people. Archimandrite of Lavra blessed the monk in this work and allowed him to settle in a little hut near the cemetery. In the summers, the pilgrimage to Amphilochius (then called father Joseph) was increasing, reaching 500 people daily. On the 11 / 12 May 2002, he was canonized by the Orthodox Church after the church commission researched his life. Just before Easter his relics were uncovered fully intact. Over 20,000 Orthodox pilgrims arrived to take part in the veneration of Saint Amphilochius. Many healings took place when people come to touch his relics. Since independence the Lavra has made many efforts to become the second Orthodox centre in Ukraine, after the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves. The first alumni from its seminary have by now gained bishop rank. The literature that is published and the icons on its walls can be found all over Ukraine, and outside in neighboring Russia and Belarus. Millions of Orthodox pilgrims visit the ancient cloister from all over the former USSR, the Balkans, and more distant Orthodox places.

The exterior of the cathedral, with two lofty towers flanking the fa√ßade, is rigorously formulated in the style transitional between baroque and neoclassicism. Several subsidiary structures, notably a winter chapel from 1862 and a refectory from 1888, adjoin the main church. After the Greek-Catholic clergy reverted to Orthodoxy, the rich and refined interior of the cathedral had to be completely renovated in order to conform to traditional Orthodox requirements. After a fire in 1874 the internal artworks were repainted by the academic Vasilyev and also participating was a sculptor Poliyevsky. The cathedral contains the tomb of Nicholas Potocki and two greatest shrines of Pochayiv - the footprint and the icon of the Theotokos. To the southeast of the Assumption Cathedral stands the 65-metre bell tower, one of the tallest in Ukraine, erected in four levels between 1861 and 1869. Its largest bell, cast in 1886, weighs 11,5 tonnes. Nearby is the Trinity Cathedral, constructed between 1906 and 1912 to a revivalist design by Aleksey Schusev. The cathedral's austere exterior is based on medieval Northern Russian architecture, while the porches feature Symbolist mosaics and paintings by Nicholas Roerich. The cave churches of St Job and of Sts Anthony and Theodosius are situated for the most part beneath the ground. Their construction started in 1774 and was carried on in several stages, the last in 1860. The church of St Job contains a famous gift from Countess Orlova, a silver reliquary with relics of that saint. More recent constructions include two chapels, one to mark the 400th anniversary of the transfer of the beholied icon of Theotokos by Anna Hoiskaja, was completed in 1997. Another chapel, to honour the second millennia since the birth of Christ, was built in 2000. File:–ü–æ—á–∞—ó–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ –ª–∞–≤—Ä–∞..JPG File:Pochayiv Lavra.

Hollywood became the center of the movie industry of the United States in the early 1910s. Biography Harvey Henderson Wilcox born in New York State, most likely in Monroe or Ontario County, the son of Aaron and Azubah (Mark) Wilcox. The family moved to Michigan during the 1830s and Harvey was raised on his parents' farm in Ogden Township, Lenawee County, Michigan. He contracted poliomyelitis in 1845 when he was about 13 years old and used a wheelchair the rest of his life. He is described as being a Kansas Prohibitionist in histories written after his death. In September 1850 Harvey was described as being an apprentice shoemaker in the Horace Sheldon household in Blissfield, Lenawee County. His apprenticeship was probably because he could not do farm-work. He completed his apprenticeship during the 1850s and in 1860 he was living near Edgerton, St. Joseph Township, Williams County, Ohio, and working as a shoemaker. On December 26, 1861, he married Ellen E. Young in Bryan, Williams County, Ohio. He got into politics in Williams County and ran for, and was elected to, several local offices, including County Recorder in 1860, Justice of the Peace (Magistrate) in 1860, and Notary Public for Williams County in 1866. He gave up shoemaking to deal in real estate in Bryan, in the firm of Wilcox & Langel, a career that he would follow the rest of his life. Elon Langel later moved to Topeka, Kansas, and died of tuberculosis. The local Bryan newspaper says in April 1868 that Harvey and Ellen Wilcox were moving to Topeka, Kansas, where, in October, 1869, Harvey published \\"H.H. Wilcox's Real Estate Publisher\\" and in July 1870 he was described as a real estate agent and his wife a housekeeper. Before March 1875 they had added G.M. Stanley, the son of Ellen's sister, Alvira, to their family, but they never had any children of their own. In June 1880 Harvey was still in real estate and Ellen was running their boarding house on Kansas Avenue. Harvey must have enjoyed being in politics in Bryan because in Topeka he got into politics again, serving as president of the city council for at least one term in 1870; joined several other men to found the town of Rossville, Kansas, in 1871; served as Topeka city clerk from at least 1877 through 1880; and owned a ranch and relatively large herd of cattle (that his adopted son, George M. Stanley, managed) near El Dorado in Butler County, Kansas. Harvey and Ellen were in the 1880 census of Topeka with George M. Stanley, the son of Ellen's sister, Alvira Stanley, in their household. Ellen contracted tuberculosis and spent the winter of 1881-1882 in California, probably staying with her sister, Mary Jane (Young) Bond in Santa Barbara, \\"chasing the cure\\". Ellen returned to Topeka, uncured, in early 1882. She was kept alive on the train with \\"powerful stimulants\\" and died at the age of 37 soon after her arrival home. She is buried in Topeka Cemetery. Harvey married as his second wife, Daeida \\"Ida\\" Hartell, a woman more than thirty years his junior, on December 6, 1882, in Topeka and in October 1883 it was reported that \\"Harvey Wilcox of Topeka, Kansas\\" was back in Ohio and Michigan visiting relatives and friends. This was probably the last time most of his relatives back East saw him and the trip was probably made in anticipation of his permanent move to California. =Hollywood Years= Hollywood Sign. Harvey and Ida moved from Topeka to Los Angeles in early 1883 and tradition says that Harvey rode in the baggage car with two of his prized horses. In Los Angeles Harvey formed the real estate company of Wilcox and Shaw. Harvey and Ida had one child, a son named Harry, who died in 1886 at the age of 18 months. Family tradition says that to console themselves over the death of their baby, Harvey and Ida would take buggy rides to the beautiful canyons west of Los Angeles. Harvey purchased one of their favorite areas for $150 per acre. It was in an agricultural area of fig and apricot orchards. Harvey tried his hand at raising fruit, but failed and decided to subdivide the land, selling lots for $1,000 each. His wife named the tract \\"Hollywood.\\" On February 1, 1887, Harvey filed a plat of the subdivision with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. He would also develop residential property, \\"The University Tract,\\" surrounding the newly built University of Southern California in 1887. Harvey and Ida were not the only members of the family to move to California. At his encouragement, his sister Sarah Luke, brother-in-law Elisha Luke, with her mother, Azubah, took the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad from Ogden to Los Angeles in November 1885 according to Adrian Weekly Press, November 13, 1885. The Lukes planned to stay only for the winter months, but Azaubah intended to remain with her son, Harvey, for the rest of her life. In February 1887 the Lukes and their daughter and son-in-law, Sam and Rosetta Young, with their young son, Almon, and Harvey's recently remarried brother Lewis, left Ogden to permanently settle in Los Angeles where Elisha would also become a real estate agent and land developer. The \\"Blissfield [Michigan] Advance\\" said in its Friday, February 18, 1887, edition that \\"Sam Young and wife and Elisha Luke and wife started for California last Thursday. Thus Ogden loses two of its staunch farmers, and the Prohibs, two valuable members.\\" Harvey's brother Lewis Wilcox would soon leave California to return to Lenawee County where he would continue as a minister of the United Brethren church in Dundee, Michigan, until his death ten years later. Azubah died in Los Angeles in 1888 and was buried on the Luke family lot in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, her son, Harvey, would be buried next to her in 1891. Harvey's brother, Horace, is often credited as being a founder of Hollywood, but Horace, who was one of Harvey's younger brothers, stayed in Michigan where he married first Amanda McCourtie and after her death in 1880, Martha Lord. Horace raised purebred Shropshire sheep on his farm in Woodstock Township, Lenawee County, Michigan, was also the Woodstock School Inspector, and a teacher until his death in 1916. There is no original source that says Harvey H. Wilcox was a Prohibitionist, although he probably was. The only known active Prohibitionists in the family were his sister, Sarah, and her husband, Elisha Luke, and almost certainly Harvey's brothers, twins Lewis and Luther, both of whom were ministers. =Death= Harvey was about fifty-nine years old when he died at his sister-in-law Sylvia Connell's home where he had come two weeks earlier so he could be closer to medical care in Los Angeles. He left a twenty-eight-year-old widow. His funeral was held from the First Methodist church in Hollywood, of which he was a member. Harvey's obituary in the Adrian newspaper, Michigan Messenger, April 1, 1891, says that he left a fortune of $100,000 ($2.37 million in 2008 dollars), so obviously he did not die penniless as some histories suggest. This obituary also confirms his place in the Aaron and Azubah Wilcox family, mentioning his brother, Lewis Wilcox, who at that time lived in Adrian. Three years after Harvey's death, Daeida, then aged 31, married Philo J. Beveridge, the son of a former governor of Illinois, and a man thirteen years her senior. They had three children. Wilcox was originally buried alongside his mother, Azubah (Mark) Wilcox, in Rosedale Cemetery, but on November 13, 1922, his remains were moved to Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, today named Hollywood Forever Memorial Park where he is interred next to his second wife, Ida.

Hayes, and directed by Greg Beeman. It stars brothers Joey and Andrew Lawrence. Joey Lawrence was also a co-producer for the film. The film was followed by a 2001 sequel titled Jumping Ship. Plot Michael Woods is a lazy, preppy 20-year-old living off his parents' wealth in Los Angeles, while struggling through college classes and dating a spoiled heiress named Gina, whom his family dislikes. Michael learns that his 11-year-old cousin Tommy Biggs, whom he has not seen since a family reunion several years earlier, will soon be arriving from Montana to visit. Michael casts Tommy aside during his visit, prioritizing his social life and the demands of his girlfriend over his guest. On Tommy's last day in California, the family housekeeper Arlene makes Michael aware of his mistreatment toward Tommy and that she will tell Glenn and Jacy everything. Michael decides to take Tommy to Disneyland to make up for it. However, en route to the theme park, Michael receives a phone call from Gina pleading for him to meet her at a racetrack so she can introduce him to her father. Michael capitulates and leaves Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, then drives to the track for a brief visit. At the race track, Michael charms Gina's father over the course of a couple hours. When Michael realizes how late it is, he hurries back to pick up Tommy, and accidentally collides his Porsche Boxster with another vehicle. Afterwards upon arriving at the kiddie park, Michael learns Arlene had picked up Tommy several hours earlier. When he comes home, Tommy angrily confronts him about this. Arlene mentions that she is disappointed in him for how he treated his cousin. They don't tell his parents about it and Michael lies that he got the dent in his car from a hit- and-run. After Tommy returns to Montana and during dinner, Jacy mentions that she got a call from Michael's aunt, Jules, who told her that Tommy didn't get to do much of anything. In turn, she mentions that they are very disappointed in him. Glenn confronts Michael and mentions that Arlene has told him everything. He demands that Michael explains his reasons for him leaving Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, rather than cancel his plans with Gina. He claims that if he canceled on her in meeting her father and took Tommy to Disneyland, she threatened to break up with him. Glenn tells Michael off that was no excuse since Tommy was family and he should've known better. His problems become worse when the police officers come over to the house and inform his parents of the accident between him and Deidre White. This truth further enrages both Glenn and Jacy because earlier Michael claimed he was in a hit- and-run as he was leaving the horse track. The police mentions that while he did the right thing to get Deidre's information and give out his own, she wrote his license plate number on a piece of paper, which they used to track him back to the house. Now more irritated by his selfish behavior, Glenn decrees that in order for Michael to start acting like an adult and learn responsibility: he needs to go to Montana to work on the Biggs ranch for a month. Michael refuses to go there and tries to negotiate his way out of that trip. However, Glenn makes it clear that it's not negotiable anymore. He points out that he and Jacy are fed up with Michael's behavior. Glenn mentions that if they get a negative telephone call from the Biggs regarding Michael, they intend to cancel his upcoming trip with Gina to the French Riviera. Michael arrives at the ranch, where he meets Jules' ranch hands, Twister and Mule, as well as Tommy. Michael is put to work early the next morning, although every task he is assigned by Tommy is deliberately sabotaged to make his labor harder, as revenge for his earlier neglect. One example is being ordered to load wood onto a ramshackle truck, only for Mule to laugh he has not driven it for years and points out a newer pickup truck. Michael eventually confronts Tommy regarding his behavior, and reveals that he only got along with him at their family reunion years ago because they were the only children at the event. No longer caring if his parents cancel his trip to the French Riviera with Gina, Michael demands Tommy to leave him alone and let him go through the month in peace. He dejectedly agrees and believes that his cousin truly doesn't care for him. The next morning and angered over hearing about Michael's mistreatment over Tommy, Twister reprimands him for his lazy and entitled behavior. He points out that his family are grateful to do hard work and appreciate what they have. Twister mentions that he has seen how much Michael hardly appreciates the life he has and has overheard half of his phone conversations with his girlfriend, complaining about the work on the ranch. During their discussion, he is surprised to learn that the Biggs are suffering financial problems and wonders aloud why no one in his family told him this. Twister reveals that they felt like Michael doesn't care about anyone except himself and his snooty girlfriend. Twister ends the conversation by telling him off to reexamine his attitude. After Twister's confrontation, Michael realizes how selfish he has been and begins adapting to life on the ranch. He mends his relationship with Tommy, who reveals his father was terminally ill, and his medical bills combined with the loss of labor from his death snowballed into financial woes. Michael expresses remorse over not spending time with Tommy more when he learns why Jules really sent him to LA and feels worse in not putting his social life on hold. Later, Michael is upset when Jules tells him that the ranch will be foreclosed soon because her mortgage is past due. The bank plans to auction the family's ranch and personal property at the end of the month. Michael returns to Los Angeles after a month on the ranch, now a more mature man and finding his old life no longer interesting. A jumping horse scares everyone at the track, but Michael tames it remembering his lessons from Mule. Michael ends his relationship with Gina after realizing that his parents were right and she is a rich snob. When Michael comes home and chastises his father for not helping the Biggs, he learns that Glenn had tried to help them out. He mentions to Michael that he offered them financial aid to keep the ranch from being foreclosed. However, Jules was too prideful to accept it to the point that not even Glenn and Jacy could get her to change her mind. Michael sells his Porsche and returns to Montana to present the money from the sale to keep the ranch operational until a permanent solution can be devised. Jules graciously rejects Michael's offer and suggests that it is time for she and Tommy to move on. Michael doesn't give up very easily. On the day of the auction, Michael recalls a real estate class he took that taught about the concept of a land trust, which, if arranged in conjunction with the bank, would allow the Biggs to remain on the property indefinitely regardless of the debt. Michael successfully negotiates the terms with the bank. Jules agrees to let Michael continue working on the ranch and spend more time with the family. Later, Tommy and Michael finish a tree house that Tommy's father had been working on prior to his illness.

On its premiere night, the film had approximately 3.2 million viewers and was the most watched program during its timeslot. The film was watched in approximately 2,054,000 households, more than any previous Disney Channel program. Up to that point, Horse Sense was also the second highest-rated basic cable film for the month of November 1999. Reception Paul Schultz of the New York Daily News wrote, \\"Horse Sense is none too subtle, pounding home its messages of selflessness and hard work. But it's well-acted and well-paced, and it's always good to see Hollywood point out the shallowness of Hollywood life.\\" Lynne Heffley of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"It's predictable as all get-out, but Walters has a nicely understated strength, while brothers Andy and Joey make a likable on-screen team.\\" In 2012, Tara Aquino of Complex ranked the film at number 22 on the magazine's list of the 25 best Disney Channel Original Movies. In May 2016, Aubrey Page of Collider ranked each of the 99 Disney Channel Original Movies released up to that point. Page ranked Horse Sense at number 71 and wrote, \\"Real-life brothers Joey and Andrew Lawrence were a late-90s dream team, so spending 80 minutes watching them bond by doing various outdoors-y things like building a treehouse is an okay way to spend an afternoon.\\" References External links * American comedy films American films 1999 television films 1999 films 1999 comedy films Disney Channel Original Movie films Films directed by Greg Beeman English-language films Films set in Beverly Hills, California Films set in Montana ","title":"Horse Sense"},{"id":"3520844","text":"Daniel Joseph Tobin (April 1875 - November 14, 1955) was an American labor leader and president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT, or \\"the Teamsters\\") from 1907 to 1952. From 1917 to 1928, he was secretary- treasurer of the American Federation of Labor. He served on the federation's Executive Council beginning in 1934, and served until his resignation in 1952. Early life Tobin was born in Miltown Malbay, County Clare, Ireland, on April 2, 1872 and baptized on April 3, 1872 at St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Miltown Malbay to John and Bridget (Kennelly) Tobin. His father was a shopkeeper, and the family Roman Catholic. He attended public school in Ireland, but did not graduate. In August 1898, he married Annie Reagan.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. The couple had five sons and one daughter.\\"Daniel Tobin Dies,\\" New York Times, November 15, 1955. Tobin immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1890. He found employment as a sheet metal worker, and attended high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts at night. In 1894, he became a motorman and driver for a local street car company. He found work as a truck driver for a local meatpacking firm (earning $11 a week), and joined Local 25 of the Teamsters at its founding. He was elected the union's business representative in 1904. On January 1, 1907, he was elected president of the Teamsters' Joint District Council covering the Boston area.\\"Shea Beaten By 10 Votes,\\" Boston Daily Globe, August 10, 1907. Election as Teamster president The American Federation of Labor (AFL) had begun organizing local unions of teamsters soon after its founding in 1886. These local unions were directly affiliated with the AFL rather than a national union of their own. In November 1898, the AFL called a convention to establish a national union for teamsters‚Äîthe Team Drivers' International Union. George Innis was elected the union's first president. In 1902, another new national union of teamsters formed in Chicago, Illinois, the Team Driver's National Union. In 1903, the AFL brokered a merger agreement between the two unions, which created the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Cornelius Shea was elected the union's first president, but the union remained divided between its two primary predecessor groups.Taft, The A.F. of L. in the Time of Gompers, 1957. In 1905, Shea led the Teamsters in a walkout aimed at the Montgomery Ward department store in Chicago. The strike, which was unsuccessful, was a violent, long and bitter one. Toward the end of the strike, Shea and several other Teamster leaders were indicted on charges of extortion.Leidenberger, Chicago's Progressive Alliance: Labor and the Bid for Public Streetcars, 2006. Angry at the strike's failure, Shea's apparent guilt in the extortion plot, and Shea's failure to unite the union's two warring factions, union members ousted Shea in August 1907 and elected Tobin in his place by a vote of 104 to 94 Deseret Evening News, August 9, 1907 Tobin took control as president of the international union on August 10, 1907, and moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, (where the IBT's headquarters were then located). Although he faced opposition in his re-election races in 1908, 1909 and 1910, he never faced opposition again until his retirement in 1952.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The Policies and Practices of the American Federation of Labor, 1900-1909, 1964. Teamster presidency, 1907-1931 Tobin faced a crisis early in his presidency. In mid-1907, a group of dissident teamsters, the United Teamsters of America, had formed as a dual union and was seeking to organize members. Tobin pleaded for Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, to intervene and bring about unity. Although Gompers worked hard at healing the rift, he was unsuccessful. When unity proved unworkable, Gompers denounced the United Teamsters as a dual union, declared their organizing practices deceptive, used the power of the AFL to promote the Teamsters as the only \\"legitimate\\" union for drivers, and ordered all local and regional AFL bodies to refuse to affiliate or cooperate with the United Teamsters. The tactics worked, and the United Teamsters soon faded away. Much of Tobin's presidency was consumed by a long-running and sometimes physically violent jurisdictional battle with the National Union of United Brewery Workmen. The Teamsters had challenged the Brewery Workmen's right to organize beer wagon drivers in 1903 and 1905. At Tobin's insistence, in 1907 the AFL revoked the Brewery Workers' charter, but a firestorm of protest from local unions around the country led the AFL to reinstate the charter in 1909. In 1933, the AFL Executive Council agreed to strip the brewery workers' union, now known as the United Brewery Workers, of the beer drivers. The United Brewery Workers filed suit in federal court in 1936 seeking to bar their suspension and the transfer of workers to the Teamsters. As the case worked its way to the Supreme Court of the United States the AFL attempted to mediate the dispute to no avail. The Supreme Court found in the AFL's favor, and the United Brewery Workers were suspended from the AFL.Galenson, The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1960.\\"Craft Unionists Win in Federation,\\" New York Times, October 11, 1933. Tobin led the Teamsters in a series of raids against the United Brewery Workers for the next several years. Both unions also fought over the same workers in numerous organizing campaigns. The United Brewery Workers affiliated with the CIO in July 1946 to try to marshal enough resources to stop the raids.\\"AFL Will Discuss Return of Brewers,\\" New York Times, January 27, 1946. A major dispute broke out on September 1946 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both unions engaged in jurisdictional strikes against one another. Beatings, riots and bombings occurred in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Ohio. Fears grew that the labor war would spread across the country. An NLRB election held in 1949 was won by the United Brewery Workers and defused the tense situation, but raiding continued for the next 20 years.\\"Dispute Hampers Breweries,\\" Associated Press, October 3, 1946; \\"AFL and CIO Dispute Over Brewery Union,\\" New York Times, October 22, 1946; \\"Breweries Face Supply Blockade,\\" New York Times, October 24, 1946; \\"NLRB Voting Set in AFL Beer Fight,\\" New York Times, February 9, 1947; \\"9 Hurt in AFL-CIO Clash,\\" New York Times, November 27, 1946; \\"Bombings and Beatings in AFL-CIO Rivalry in Beer Trade Are Told to House Committee,\\" New York Times, March 7, 1947; Committee on Education and Labor, The Pittsburgh Beer War, 1947; Levey, \\"Beck Details Plan of Teamster Drive,\\" New York Times, January 15, 1949; \\"CIO Union Defies Beck,\\" New York Times, February 21, 1949; \\"CIO Brewery Unit Wins,\\" Associated Press, September 2, 1949; \\"Brewery Tie-Up Reduces St. Louis Beer to Trickle,\\" Associated Press, October 24, 1951; Levey, \\"Major Test Snaps A.F.L.-C.I.O. Peace,\\" New York Times, March 21, 1952. The Teamsters also engaged in fierce jurisdictional disputes with the Gasoline State Operators' National Council (an AFL federal union of gas station attendants), the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the Retail Clerks International Union, and the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks.Bernstein, The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941, 1970. The Teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under Tobin. When he was elected president, power in the union was held by big-city locals‚Äîwhich handled all research, contract negotiations, legal services, communication and strike activity. Tobin pushed for the development of \\"joint councils\\" to which all local unions were forced to affiliate. Varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction, the joint councils became important incubators for up-and-coming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry. As collective bargaining became the norm throughout the Teamsters, Tobin actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts. Tobin also founded and edited (for a time) the union magazine, the International Teamster.Bernstein, The Lean Years: A History of the American Worker, 1920-1933, 1972.Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989. Initially, Tobin remained outside the AFL's decision-making hierarchy. But his policy stands reflected his support for Gompers. In 1913, when the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was locked in a bitter strike in Michigan, Tobin supported Gompers' refusal to establish a national strike fund to aid the WFM‚Äîor any other union, for that matter. In 1915, the Catholic Archbishop of Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, Fran√ßois- Xavier Cloutier, denounced secular labor unions. Archbishop Cloutier urged Catholics to abandon secular trade unions and join Catholic workers' unions. By 1919, anecdotal reports indicated that the number of Canadian Catholic workers leaving unions affiliated with the AFL had grown significantly, and Gompers feared a backlash by Protestant union members. In 1921, Gompers appointed Tobin, along with Matthew Woll and Frank Duffy, to a committee to investigate the problem. Their report indicated that the number of disaffiliating members was low; the problem was limited to the cities of Montreal, Sherbrooke and Quebec City; and that the only union significantly affected was the Carpenters. Tobin and the others issued a report documenting the inferior contracts of the Catholic workers' unions, and the issue was laid to rest. In late 1916, Samuel Gompers began pushing for the AFL to take a strongly supportive stance on President Woodrow Wilson's pro-war policies vis- a-vis Germany. Tobin and eight other international union leaders met on May 27, 1915, to oppose American war preparations. Unwilling to actually oppose war, the group asked Gompers to form a committee to enunciate labor's stand on the European conflict.Montgomery, The Fall of the House of Labor, 1987. When war came, Gompers wholeheartedly supported it. On March 11, 1917, the AFL Executive Council met and (reportedly) unanimously endorsed American entry in the war. Tobin quickly exposed this as a lie. In an article in the International Teamster, he wrote that the vote had been up-or-down, with no possibility of amendment. He also reported that he himself had abstained from voting, which made the vote only technically unanimous. After the United States entered World War I, Tobin initially refused to acceded to Gompers' request for a ban on strikes.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Labor and World War I, 1914-1918, 1987. In 1917, Tobin defeated John B. Lennon in the race for treasurer of the AFL.At the time, the offices of secretary and treasurer were separate. \\"Re-Elect Gompers, Lennon Defeated,\\" New York Times, November 25, 1917.One scholar argues Tobin's election win over Lennon‚ÄîGompers' \\"trusted aide\\"‚Äîwas a signal that the member unions of the AFL were unhappy with Gompers' pro-war policies and failure to win government support for union organizing. Montgomery, The Fall of the House of Labor, 1987, p. 386. Although membership in the AFL had risen to 2.371 million in 1917 from 2.072 million the year before, socialists and others in the federation felt that Lennon had not been sufficiently aggressive. Tobin, however, was forced to defend his previous actions, denounce pacifism, and declare his full support for the war effort. AFL president Samuel Gompers and Tobin quickly became close friends and supporters of one another. Tobin quickly became one of the inner circle of AFL vice presidents (which included Matthew Woll, John P. Frey and William Hutcheson). During the presidency of William Green, Tobin and the others largely controlled the AFL.Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992. Tobin served as one of the AFL's delegates to the President's Industrial Commission in 1919. That same year, Gompers chose Tobin as the AFL's second delegate to the founding convention of the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU).\\"Labor Leaders to Sail,\\" New York Times, July 4, 1919. Tobin would serve as an AFL delegate to the IFTU until the AFL withdrew from that body in 1945.Taft, The A.F. of L. From the Death of Gompers to the Merger, 1959. In 1918 and 1920, he served as an AFL delegate to the Pan-American Labor Conference.\\"Labor Conference Bars Bolshevism,\\" New York Times, November 16, 1918. In 1920, Annie Tobin died. In October 1922, Tobin married the former Irene Halloran. The couple had one daughter. In September 1921, Tobin attempted to resign as treasurer of the AFL in a dispute with Gompers over the AFL's support for unemployment insurance. Gompers opposed the legislation, fearing worker dependence on government handouts and that government rather than unions would be seen as more important to workers. Tobin strongly supported the initiative, however. Gompers, however, realized he was in the minority on the AFL Executive Council and relented. Gompers refused to accept Tobin's resignation, and Tobin continued as treasurer.\\"Tobin Quits A.F.L. Council,\\" New York Times, September 13, 1921. In 1921, Tobin helped defeat an amendment offered by African American union members which would have forced all members of the AFL to remove the word \\"white\\" from their constitutions and to admit all workers regardless of race, creed or nationality. Although three resolutions were offered, only one made it to the convention floor. When black delegates attempted to bypass the Committee on Organization (which had jurisdiction over the resolutions) and introduce the amendments on the floor of the 1921 AFL convention, Tobin supported Gompers in declaring the amendment out of order because it violated the AFL's explicit policy of noninterference in its members' affairs.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The T.U.E.L., 1925-1929, 1994. Tobin tried and failed to get the AFL to endorse Robert M. La Follette for President in 1924. When Tobin attempted to obtain AFL endorsement of the candidacy of Democrat Alfred E. Smith in the 1928 presidential election, AFL President William Green forced a resolution through the AFL Executive Council which reaffirmed the federation's nonpartisan policy. Tobin resigned as treasurer of the AFL in anger. Although Green and others feared the Teamsters might withdraw from the federation, Tobin assured the Executive Council he had no intention of doing so.\\"A.F of L. Neutral, Despite Smith Plea,\\" New York Times, August 8, 1928. He became increasingly involved in Democratic politics, and chaired the Labor Bureau of the Democratic National Committee in 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944. His re- appointment in 1936 by DNC chair James A. Farley deeply upset the leadership of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), who felt Tobin an uninspired campaigner and strategist. In response, the CIO formed Labor's Non- Partisan League to fully and completely mobilize labor support for Roosevelt.Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: The Politics of Upheaval, 1935-1936, 1960. But despite the division in the American labor movement, by 1944 Tobin was working closely with the CIO PAC.\\"Tobin Is Prepared to Work With PAC,\\" New York Times, September 10, 1944. Teamster presidency, 1931-1952 When Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, William Green and other AFL officials attempted to have Tobin appointed Secretary of Labor. Tobin was an ardent New Dealer. Roosevelt appeared to express an interest in Tobin, but told close associates he was also considering John P. Frey and Edward McGrady. Roosevelt eventually chose Frances Perkins, angering Green.Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: Crisis of the Old Order, 1919-1933, 1957; \\"Roosevelt Is Asked to Make Tobin Aide,\\" New York Times, December 20, 1932. Tobin proved to be an adept organizer. Teamster membership stood at just 82,000 in 1932. Tobin took advantage of the wave of pro-union sentiment engendered by the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and by 1935 union membership had risen nearly 65 percent to 135,000. By 1941, Tobin had a dues-paying membership of 530,000‚Äîmaking the Teamsters the fastest-growing labor union in the United States. Under Tobin, the Teamsters first developed the \\"conference\\" system. The regional conference was first adopted by Dave Beck, president of the Seattle Joint Council, as a means of counteracting the conservative leadership of Joint Councils in San Francisco. In 1937, Beck persuaded Tobin that the Western Conference of Teamsters was no threat to the power and authority of the international union. Soon, conferences had sprung up across the U.S., providing stability, organizing strength and leadership to the international union. But under Tobin, corruption became much more widespread in the Teamsters. By 1941, the union was considered the most corrupt in the United States, and the most abusive towards its own members. Tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations, but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses.Galenson claims that Tobin's \\"personal honesty was never challenged...\\" Yet, by the end of his life, Tobin left an extremely large trust fund for his wife, which some observers argue was evidence of corruption. Galenson, The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1960, p. 471. See \\"Tobin Left Big Income to Wife,\\" Associated Press, November 20, 1955. Most historians conclude that Tobin may have been somewhat dishonest, but only on occasion, and that in the annals of Teamster corruption whatever crimes Tobin may have committed are small potatoes compared to those of Jimmy Hoffa, Jackie Presser or Dave Beck. See: Garnel, The Rise of Teamster Power in the West, 1972; Witwer, Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union, 2003; Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989. He was elected a vice president of the AFL in 1934, after the council expanded to 18.In 1933, Lewis proposed expanding the AFL Executive Council to 18 members from 11 members. Tobin argued this would have the effect of diluting support for President Green, and was a \\"sinister plot\\" to topple the president. Lewis, sitting on the dais on Green's left, caustically denied the charge. Tobin, sitting on Green's right, rose to his feet. Both men nearly came to blows before Green humorously defused the tension by declaring that this was merely a dispute between \\"two young boys.\\" Stark, \\"A.F. of L. Rejects 'New Leadership',\\" New York Times, October 12, 1933; See also: Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992, p. 197. Oddly, the expansion which had almost led Tobin and John L. Lewis to come to blows in 1933 led to little discussion a year later. Both Lewis and Tobin were elected to the expanded council. \\"7 Added to Council to Govern A.F. of L.,\\" New York Times, October 13, 1934. He was appointed chair of the Committee on Laws, which oversaw constitutional amendments to the AFL constitution. As chair of the committee, Tobin blocked proposals by John L. Lewis in 1935 to weaken craft unionism and permit industrial unionism.Stark, \\"Fist Fight Puts A.F. of L. In Uproar,\\" New York Times, October 20, 1935. Tobin was a very strong anti-communist and anti-fascist. He argued that holding radical ideas was not enough to warrant expulsion of a union from the AFL, but supporting the Communist Party was. His anti-fascist views were given less prominence in his actions. However, he was highly critical of Father Charles Coughlin. When President Green sent an observer to a meeting of Coughlin's National Union for Social Justice, Tobin excoriated Green for doing so (and for not consulting the Executive Council first). Tobin's anti- communism led him to attempt to dismantle Local 574, which had led the successful Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. The local (led by Carl Skoglund, Farrell Dobbs and the Dunne Brothers) was avowedly Trotskyist, but had successfully led the union through the general strike. Alarmed at the local leadership's political views, Tobin revoked Local 574's charter and set up a competing local (Local 500). But after Local 574 secured a jurisdictional agreement in early 1935 from the Minneapolis Central Labor Union, it undertook a wildly successful organizing campaign and thrived. The AFL and the Minnesota Federation of Labor were alarmed at the growth of the Trotskyist-led union, and demanded action. In October 1935, the Teamsters international union passed a resolution denying membership to communists. Tobin also agreed to let an AFL organizer attempt to raid Local 574. The AFL and Local 574 engaged in mutual acts of violence. But when it became clear that Local 574 could not be raided and that the CIO might offer membership to the renegade local, Tobin convinced Local 574 leader Victor Dunne to merge with Local 500. A year later, the newly formed Local 544 had organized 250,000 truckers in the Midwest and formed the Central Conference of Teamsters.Korth, Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934, 1995; Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal, 1933-1935, 1959. But after several of Local 544's leaders left the organization,Some formed new locals, which they proceeded to lead. One was murdered by organized crime figures. One was killed by a mentally ill union organizer, and one committed suicide. Tobin trusted the local in 1941 and ejected the remaining Trotskyist leadership. When the CIO offered the ousted leaders a role in the newly formed United Construction Workers Organizing Committee, Tobin used his influence with the federal government to secure a federal indictment of sedition under the Smith Act. Several of the men were convicted (although most were acquitted or had charges dropped), and the local broken. Tobin was a lukewarm supporter of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). He did not oppose its passage, but expressed deep concern that the Act did not expressly protect craft unionism and allow the creation of craft-based bargaining units. Tobin convinced the AFL to seek introduction of an amendment permitting bargaining units along craft lines. But although Senator Robert F. Wagner agreed to submit the amendment, he failed to do so. After the quick growth of the CIO under the NLRB, Tobin became disenchanted and suggested that the NLRA be repealed and the NLRB disbanded.\\"Teamsters Score NLRB,\\" Associated Press, June 19, 1942; \\"Teamsters Union Asks Repeal Of Wagner Act and End of NLRB,\\" New York Times, January 9, 1945; \\"Tobin For Labor Law, But He Hits the NLRB,\\" New York Times, February 1, 1945. In time, Tobin came to strongly support the Act.In large part, this was because the Teamsters were able to successfully raid other unions‚Äîsuch as the longshoremen's unions‚Äîunder the NLRA. Galenson, The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1960. Although Tobin supported the principle of craft unionism, he was tolerant of unions which advocated industrial unionism under certain limitations.For a contrary view, see Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992, and Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989. Dubofsky and Van Tine's claims, however, are often ad hominem, repetitious, and unspecific. Phelan's claim relies heavily on the short biography in Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984, which does not claim that Tobin was an ardent craft unionist along the lines of William Hutcheson. In many ways, the Teamsters were already an industrial union, with wide diversity in membership, and Tobin advocated a moderate line toward industrial unionism in part to defend his own union. When the AFL Executive Council proposed in July 1935 suspending the unions which had formed the Committee for Industrial Organization, Tobin argued that the Executive Council lacked the authority to do so.Most historians conclude Tobin was correct. For example, Taft notes that the Executive Council ignored parliamentary procedure (including a motion made by Tobin) in order to ram through a motion by President Green to try the CIO unions. Taft, The A.F. of L. From the Death of Gompers to the Merger, 1959; Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989; Galenson, The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1960. But once the Executive Council's decision was made, Tobin enforced it and ordered Teamster local unions to cut off relations with CIO unions. Tobin remained eager to heal the breach between AFL and CIO, however. Tobin had a strong relationship with John L. Lewis,Tobin had been one of the few supporters of the United Mine Workers in the 1919 coal strike. For a contrary view, see Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992. and the AFL relied on this relationship in peace talks. Tobin was a member of the AFL committee, involved in merger talks in 1936, 1937, and 1939 and helped negotiate the 1942 agreement, which established a joint AFL-CIO jurisdictional disputes committee. In a front-page article which appeared in The New York Times on January 19, 1942, Lewis claimed that he and Tobin had agreed to merge the AFL and CIO on the condition that William Green retire, George Meany become president, and Philip Murray accept demotion to secretary-treasurer.Raskin, \\"Lewis, A.F.L. Agreed to End Labor Rift,\\" New York Times, January 19, 1942. The next day, Murray denied agreement had been reached and repudiated any agreement with did not include him or demoted him. See \\"Murray Puts Aside Labor Peace Talks,\\" New York Times, January 20, 1942. Whether Tobin was actually involved in any negotiations or whether the entire incident was simply in the mind of John L. Lewis is unclear. Historian Robert Zieger claims Lewis made up the agreement, as does one of Meany's biographers. See: Zieger, John L. Lewis: Labor Leader, 1988; Zieger, The CIO, 1935-1955, 1997; Goulden, Meany, 1972. The authors of a definitive biography of Lewis treat the incident as if Tobin did reach agreement with Lewis; see Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992. But Arthur Goldberg, CIO general counsel at the time as well as author of a history of AFL-CIO merger talks, is suspicious that an agreement existed but does not firmly deny it. See Goldberg, AFL-CIO: Labor United, 1956. He played an active role in the 1943 negotiations to get United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) back into AFL, and served on the Committee of Ten, which negotiated the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955.Goldberg, AFL-CIO: Labor United, 1956; Stark, \\"Tobin Resigns Post As AFL Conferee,\\" New York Times, March 2, 1939. Tobin had long opposed UMWA reaffiliation except on the terms dictated by the 1935 AFL Executive Council's trial of the CIO unions. But the growing influence of the CIO in government councils and in the eyes of the media mitigated Tobin's arguments and led the Executive Council to readmit the union in 1946.Shaplen, \\"AFL-Lewis Peace Hampered By Tobin,\\" New York Times, February 8, 1945; Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992. In June 1940, President Roosevelt appointed Tobin to be the official White House liaison to organized labor. But Tobin resigned on August 26, 1940. He accepted re-appointment as chair of the Labor Division of the Democratic National Committee as worries about Roosevelt's ability to win a third term mounted.Stark, \\"White House Link to Conciliate A.F.L.,\\" New York Times, June 11, 1940; \\"Tobin, to Aid Flynn, Quits White House,\\" New York Times, August 27, 1940. On September 23, 1944, Roosevelt gave his famous \\"Fala speech\\" while campaigning in the 1944 presidential election. Because of Roosevelt's strong relationship with Tobin, the President delivered his speech before the Teamster convention. The first real challenge to Tobin's leadership of the Teamsters also came in 1940. The Teamsters paid Tobin a salary of $30,000 that year, when the large union had only 450,000 members. But despite the financial encomium, dissident members of the union accused him of being a dictator over the union's affairs. Tobin angrily denied the charges.Stark, \\"Dictatorship Issue Stirs Teamsters,\\" New York Times, September 14, 1940. Over the next year, however, Tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusteed several large locals led by his political opponents.\\"Teamsters Order 2d Ouster in Jersey,\\" Associated Press, March 12, 1941; \\"Seceding Drivers Face Union Strife,\\" New York Times, June 11, 1941. During World War II, Tobin strongly supported the labor movement's no-strike pledge. In early 1942, President Roosevelt asked the AFL and CIO to appoint members to a \\"Labor War Board\\" (also known as the \\"Labor Victory Board\\") to advise him on how labor could contribute to the war effort. Tobin and the other labor leaders agreed to cease raiding one another and to not strike for the duration of the national emergency. Nevertheless, Tobin sanctioned strikes involving Midwestern truckers in August 1942, Southern truckers in October 1943, and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in January 1945. But he also demanded that other unions punish wildcat strikers, asked the public to punish those unions which went on strike, and ordered his own members to cross picket lines unless specifically told not to by the international union.\\"President Summons 'Labor War Board',\\" New York Times, February 5, 1942; \\"President Meets Joint Labor Group,\\" New York Times, February 7, 1942; \\"WLB Demands End of Trucking Strike,\\" New York Times, August 25, 1942; \\"Tobin Demands Unions Punish Strikers,\\" New York Times, March 6, 1943; \\"Tobin Bids Public Insist Work Go On,\\" New York Times, June 7, 1943; \\"Truck Tie-Up Halts Freight in South,\\" Associated Press, October 11, 1943; \\"3 Breweries Face Seizure In Strike,\\" New York Times, January 14, 1945; \\"Deliveries Halted on Certified Milk,\\" New York Times, January 15, 1945; \\"Tobin Tells Union to Ignore Pickets,\\" Associated Press, May 31, 1945. In 1942, President Roosevelt again asked Tobin to join the White House staff. This time, he appointed Tobin as a special representative to the United Kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there. After a month abroad, Tobin reported that although Great Britain suffered from a number of strikes, the labor unions were not communist- dominated nor unpatriotic and that the large number of strikes was justified.\\"English Labor in War Described By Tobin,\\" New York Times, September 27, 1942. He was considered three times for Secretary of Labor, and twice refused the post‚Äîin 1943 and 1947.Stark, \\"Successor Sought for Miss Perkins,\\" New York Times, December 11, 1944; \\"Tobin Endorsed for Labor Post,\\" New York Times, January 18, 1945; Hulen, \\"Successors Named,\\" New York Times, May 24, 1945; \\"Dan Tobin Refused 2 Cabinet Offers,\\" New York Times, August 12, 1948. Tobin did not, however, permit the Teamsters to participate in the great post- war wave of labor strikes. In the two years following the cessation of hostilities, the Teamsters only struck three times: One unit of 10,000 truckers in New Jersey struck for two weeks. Workers at UPS struck nationwide for three weeks before Tobin ordered an end to the strike. And workers at Railway Express Agency struck for almost a month before Tobin ordered workers back to work.Raskin, \\"Union Vote Today,\\" New York Times, September 12, 1946; Raskin, \\"Situation Is Eased,\\" New York Times, September 13, 1946; Lissner, \\"Tobin Bids Union End Parcel Strike,\\" New York Times, September 19, 1946; Raskin, \\"Express Strikers Picket Airfield,\\" New York Times, October 10, 1947; \\"Union Head Scores Express Walkout,\\" New York Times, October 13, 1947; \\"Tobin Warns Union On Wage Demands,\\" New York Times, June 4, 1948. Tobin strongly opposed the Taft-Hartley Act and repeatedly called for its repeal. Nonetheless, he was one of the first labor leaders to sign the non-communist affidavit required by the law.Signing the affidavit provided the Teamsters with the protection of the NLRA, which was an important tool in the Teamsters' fight with the Brewery Workers. \\"Tobin Opposes Law On Labor Disputes,\\" New York Times, January 19, 1947; \\"Tobin Signs Affidavit,\\" New York Times, September 16, 1947; Davies, \\"Tobin Again Heads Teamsters' Union,\\" New York Times, August 16, 1947. In 1948, Tobin became disenchanted with the Democratic Party and President Harry S. Truman. For the first time since 1928, he refused to be a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and refused to speak at the convention when invited to do so. In the 1948 presidential election, he refused to endorse Truman, refused to put the resources of the national Teamsters union behind Truman's re-election, and told local unions to vote their conscience.\\"Tobin Rejects Bid As Indianan Delegate,\\" New York Times, July 7, 1948; \\"Tobin Refuses to Speak,\\" Associated Press, July 8, 1948; \\"Teamsters Union to Let Locals Pick Sides in Presidential Race,\\" New York Times, September 7, 1948; \\"Tobin Urges Teamsters Vote Own Choice Nov. 2,\\" Associated Press, September 8, 1948. Retirement and death Tobin ruled the Teamsters in a relatively autocratic fashion for much of his tenure as president. Although challenged by the rank-and-file in 1940, no serious contender for the presidency emerged until nearly a decade later. The first sign that Tobin had a challenger within the Teamsters came in 1947. Dave Beck had risen steadily in the Teamsters hierarchy in the Pacific Northwest, becoming president of the Western Conference of Teamsters in 1937 and an international vice-president in 1940. As Beck's influence rose, Tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed. After Beck's election as vice-president, he began to challenge Tobin for control of the union. In 1947, Beck marshaled his forces and defeated a proposed dues increase to fund new organizing.Davies, \\"Teamsters Defeat Tobin On Tax Rise,\\" New York Times, August 15, 1947. In 1942, he began a six-year campaign to seize control of the International Teamster newsmagazine. He ousted its editor and won the executive board's approval to install his own man in the job in 1948.\\"Union Editor Is Ousted,\\" Associated Press, September 3, 1948. In 1946, Beck successfully campaigned to amend the union's constitution to create the post of executive vice-president. He subsequently won the 1947 election to fill the position. In 1948, Beck essentially supplanted Tobin as the real power in the Teamsters union. On April 22, 1948, the Machinists (which was not a member of the AFL) struck Boeing in Seattle, Washington. On May 28, Beck announced that Teamsters would seek to organize the workers at Boeing, and formed Aeronautical Workers and Warehousemen Helpers Union Local 451 to raid the Machinists. Beck and Boeing officials made a secret agreement in which Boeing would hire members of Local 451‚Äîessentially hiring Teamsters as scabs and strikebreakers. After as many as a third of the Machinists had joined the Teamsters, the Machinists agreed to return to work without a contract. Beck's actions were nearly universally condemned by members of the AFL Executive Council. The AFL Executive Council met in August 1948 to take action against Beck. The day before the meeting, Tobin privately told associates that he would repudiate Beck. But at a secret meeting that afternoon, Beck and his followers on the West Coast confronted Tobin with a fait accompli: Beck had allied with his long-time enemy Jimmy Hoffa. He now had more than enough votes on the Teamsters executive board to overrule Tobin if he tried to fire Beck. At the AFL meeting the next day, Tobin was forced to defend Beck's actions. Unwilling to embarrass an AFL vice president and create a confrontation with the Teamsters, the AFL Executive Council condoned the Teamster raid on the Machinists.The NLRB subsequently held an election to determine who should represent the workers at Boeing. The Machinists won the 1949 election by a 2-to-1 margin. See \\"Beck Said to Top Tobin in Teamsters,\\" New York Times, September 19, 1948; McCann, Blood in the Water: A History of District Lodge 751, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 1989; Rodden, The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle, 1984; Raskin, \\"Union Leader-And Big Business Man,\\" New York Times, November 15, 1953. Five months later, Beck won approval of a significant reform of the union's internal structure. Instead of the four divisions which existed under Tobin, Beck proposed 16 divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the union's membership. Although nearly 1,000 Teamster leaders attended the conference in which the restructuring was debated and approved, Tobin did not.\\"AFL Teamsters Begin Drastic Revamping,\\" New York Times, January 18, 1949. In 1951, Tobin's tenuous hold on the Teamsters was further exposed when Tom Hickey, reformist leader of the Teamsters in New York City, won election to the executive board. Tobin had needed Beck's support to prevent Hickey's election, and Beck refused to give it.\\"Hickey In New Union Post,\\" Associated Press, August 28, 1951. On September 4, 1952, Tobin announced he would step down as president of the Teamsters at the end of his term. But as the mid- October Teamster convention neared, Tobin and his supporters formed a draft movement designed to subvert Beck's control of the delegates. Beck retaliated by public supporting the draft movement, but privately threatening to strip Tobin of his pension and benefits should he lose an election.\\"D.J. Tobin Set to Retire,\\" New York Times, September 5, 1952; \\"Battle for Control of Union Is Revealed,\\" New York Times, October 7, 1952. At the convention which opened on October 14, the 77-year-old Tobin was paid well to vacate the presidency. His pay was increased to $50,000 (about $393,000 in 2007 dollars) from $30,000, and the executive board was authorized to pay him this salary for life. Beck submitted a resolution asking Tobin to stay on as president, but forced Tobin to refuse. As further humiliation, Tobin nominated Beck for president. He was elected by acclamation. Beck pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies.Changes to the union constitution included expanding the number of vice-presidents, expanding the number of seats on the executive board, expanding the number of delegates, and enhancing the powers and authority of the president. \\"Teamsters Raise Tobin's Pay $20,000,\\" New York Times, October 15, 1952; \\"Teamster Chiefs Defeat Opposition,\\" New York Times, October 16, 1952; \\"Curbs On Officers Rejected By Teamsters,\\" New York Times, October 17, 1952; \\"Teamsters Elect Beck As President,\\" Associated Press, October 18, 1952. After William Green died on November 20, 1952, Meany and Tobin contended for the presidency of the AFL. Tobin fell short by one vote on the first informal ballot. He withdrew from the running, convinced that Meany would eventually defeat him. The formal vote taken after his withdrawal was unanimous for Meany.Buhle, Taking Care of Business: Samuel Gompers, George Meany, Lane Kirkland, and the Tragedy of American Labor, 1999. Tobin resigned from the AFL executive council the same day. Tobin settled in Miami Beach, Florida, in a lavish home built for him by the union (which also supplied him, free of charge, with a car and driver, full-time maid, and reimbursement for all incidental expenses for the rest of his life). In October 1955, he was flown to Indianapolis, Indiana, and hospitalized at St. Vincent's Hospital suffering from hypertension and coronary heart disease. He died from complications related to the two diseases on November 14, 1955.\\"Daniel Tobin Critically Ill,\\" United Press International, November 9, 1955. He was interred in Indianapolis.\\"Rites Held for Tobin,\\" New York Times, November 18, 1955. Tobin left his wife a $5,000 a month income (about $38,900 a month in 2007 dollars). The income was paid from a trust fund of undisclosed size. The trust fund was then divided amongst his children.\\"Tobin Left Big Income to Wife,\\" Associated Press, November 20, 1955.

Established in 1933 in what was then Raritan Township, the park is considered the oldest park in the Middlesex County park system. It is owned and operated by the county government. History On July 5, 1917, the Middlesex County Board of Freeholders authorized the purchase of 208 acres of land in Raritan Township for the construction of a county hospital for tuberculosis patients.Daily Home News, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 6 July 1917, pp 1, 4 According to The Guide to Edison Township, the purchased land was \\"free of population and free from any kind of buildings. The closest people to it was one farmer and the nearest populated area was downtown Metuchen\\". On April 7, 1919, NJ Assembly Bill 498, which sought to establish a bond to facilitate the funding of construction of the hospital, died in committee, leaving the prospects for a new hospital in doubt. There was discussion of selling the land purchased for a hospital.Daily Home News, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 8 April 1919, page 1 On October 10, 1923, the Middlesex County Recreation Association hosted a luncheon/meeting at the Hotel Klein in New Brunswick and received broad support from local agencies and state and local officials to create the county's first park on the lands once designated for the tuberculosis hospital.Daily Home News, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 11 October 1923, pages 1, 2 A fundraising campaign to construct a Kiddie Keep Well camp on part of the grounds of the new county park was conducted 7-14 September 1924.Daily Home News, 14 Aug 1924, page 14 The Middlesex County freeholders established Roosevelt Park with funding from the Emergency Relief Administration in 1933 and subsequent improvements through the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Hundreds of CCC workers of the Second Corps Area (New York, Connecticut and New Jersey) trained at Camp Dix in the summers of 1934 and 1935 and were positioned at a camp seven miles west of Raritan train station, likely Raritan Arsenal. In particular, Company 1209 was trained by the US Army in forestry operations and worked in Raritan Township on CCC Project P-67 beginning August 8, 1935.

The county received $575,000 in federal funding through the Public Works Administration and construction began on May 3, 1935. The hospital was dedicated on October 31, 1936, and opened March 8, 1937. The hospital is on the National Register of Historic Places. Light Dispelling Darkness, a fountain designed by the sculptor Waylande Gregory, was sponsored by the WPA and unveiled in 1938. The theme of enlightenment through knowledge and science was inspired in part by the proximity of Menlo Park, where Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. The fountain is 15 feet high and 40 feet in diameter, with six symbolic groups representing \\"War\\", \\"Pestilence\\", \\"Famine\\", \\"Death\\", \\"Greed\\", and \\"Materialism\\". The fountain was restored in 2004 after falling into disrepair.

The statue, nicknamed \\"Iron Mike\\", is a representation of the typical CCC worker, spade in hand. It is situated on Lafayette Avenue near the corner of US Route 1 North and Grandview Avenue. Two monuments dedicated to Marie Curie can be found on Elm Drive in the park, one erected in 1938 and the other in 1993. The Middlesex County Veterans Memorial was unveiled on Veterans Day in November 2001. It consists of eight large concrete walls, six representing the various military services and two with dedications and memorials to the county's veterans, and a fountain with sculptures. The Lakeview School and Rehabilitation Center for children with cerebral palsy is located within Roosevelt Park. The Kiddie Keep Well Camp was established in 1924 to treat children with tuberculosis.

The film's plot follows Sydney, her father and his wife, stepmom Elizabeth, who come to an island on Hawaii, where they find a closer relationship to each other while struggling with ideas of changes to the island. During her time on the island, Sydney makes new friends and learns the truth about her deceased mother. The film premiered on Disney Channel on April 22, 2000. Plot Sydney Miller is a 13-year-old girl who was born in Hawaii and moved away at a young age after the death of her mother, who she barely remembers. From her great aunt, Sydney inherits a derelict Hawaiian plantation that had been used through five generations. Sydney, her father Ben, and her stepmother Elizabeth leave their residence in Chicago to visit the plantation, known as Makai. When the Millers arrive, they meet attorney Bo Kauihou, who informs them that Sydney will inherit the plantation if she stays there for two weeks. Bo attempts to dissuade Sydney's parents from selling the plantation, stating that the ground is still fertile enough for use as farm land, although Ben is hesitant as he and Elizabeth have no farm experience. Although Bo wants to preserve the plantation, he informs the Millers that there have been inquiries about purchasing the property. At the plantation, Sydney finds an old photograph of her mother and learns that she used to surf. The next day, Sydney finds a surfboard with the word \\"Naniloa\\" inscribed on it, then befriends a girl named Gia, who enjoys surfing. That night, Sydney tells her parents that she wants to spend time with Gia at a beach on the following day. Ben is apprehensive about Sydney going to the beach alone, but allows her to do so when she promises to just take pictures, without going near the water. While Ben, Elizabeth, and Bo meet with realtors, Sydney arrives at the beach with the Naniloa surfboard. Sydney is introduced to Gia's friends, including Kona, a boy who is an artist and skateboarder. Sydney confesses that she does not know how to surf, so Gia teaches her. Later, Bo and the Millers meet with the realtors to discuss a company's plans to construct a resort on the plantation property. Sydney is disappointed that the plans do not include the preservation of the plantation buildings, which were built in 1912; the realtors suggest that the main plantation house could be converted into a restaurant. They also tell Sydney that everything is negotiable after she expresses disappointment at the company's plan to make the nearby beach available to hotel guests only. While surfing, Sydney is swept off her surfboard and rescued by Kona. Sydney has a cut on her face and later awakens in a beach house belonging to Gia's mother, Malia, who has bandaged her cut. Malia tells Sydney that the Naniloa surfboard belonged to Sydney's mother, who was nicknamed Naniloa. Malia also says that she was friends with Sydney's mother. Malia is surprised to learn that Ben never mentioned the friendship. Malia then takes Sydney to a lagoon to observe its beauty; Malia tells her that it is a place where whales gather annually. Malia brings Sydney back to the plantation, and Ben becomes upset at Malia, believing that she encouraged Sydney to surf. Malia questions Ben's decision to withhold information from Sydney regarding her mother; he tells Malia that he was trying to keep Sydney away from Hawaii and surfing in order to protect her, an idea with which Malia disagrees. The next day, Sydney learns ‚Äì from Gia ‚Äì that her mother died in an accident. Sydney says her father has never discussed her mother's death and she has never asked him about it. Sydney has Kona and Gia take her to Kaala Loa, a vacant plantation, where she discovers her mother's old bedroom. The Millers receive a new monetary offer for Makai, and Sydney is left to choose whether to accept it. That night, a party is held at Kaala Loa, where Sydney and Kona share a kiss. While observing the whales, Sydney learns from Malia that her mother died while surfing. Gia's friends ignore Sydney after a newspaper article states that the plantation and beach will be sold to the company, even though she has not yet made a decision. When Sydney tells Gia that the company has promised to preserve the lagoon for the whales, Gia tells her that the animals will no longer arrive with tourists around. Gia admits that initially, she only befriended Sydney so she could convince her to keep the plantation and beach, but she says that their friendship is authentic, which Sydney does not believe. After arguing, Sydney decides to sell the property. When Sydney is ready to sign the paperwork, she notices Gia's friends outside and decides not to sell, choosing instead to live at Makai. Sydney and Gia become friends again.

Reception Mike Hughes of Gannett News Service considered Rip Girls a \\"first-rate film using unknown actors,\\" writing, \\"Many of the Disney Channel movies tend to be brightly empty. This one, however, offers both a pretty exterior and a solid core.\\" Tim Ryan of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin considered the film to be unrealistic. In June 2011, Stephan Lee of Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"it's a lot simpler than I remembered, and the performances are charmingly unpolished, but it's still one of my favorites.\\" In 2012, Tara Aquino of Complex ranked the film at number 12 on the magazine's list of the 25 best Disney Channel Original Movies. In December 2015, Jonathon Dornbush of Entertainment Weekly ranked Rip Girls at number 29 on a list of the top 30 Disney Channel Original Movies, writing that it feels like a \\"lesser combination\\" of earlier DCOMs Brink! and Johnny Tsunami: \\"The movie has its moments, with a young Camilla Belle at the center, but it ends up as a forgettable though still enjoyable mishmash of the DCOM sports genre without staking a claim for itself.\\" In May 2016, Aubrey Page of Collider ranked each DCOM released up to that point. Page ranked Rip Girls at number 54 and wrote, \\"This one is certainly less than the sum of its parts, but it has a pretty solid teeny-bopper beach playlist that still holds up today.\\" Awards In 2001, Camilla Belle and Stacie Hess received nominations at the 22nd Young Artist Awards, for Best Performance in a TV Movie (Drama), Leading Young Actress and Supporting Young Actress, respectively.

Brown as the older sister of a set of quintuplets.  Plot summary  Fourteen-year-old Jamie Grover (Kimberly J. Brown) is an only child who resents the constant attention her parents give her. Her wish for less attention is finally granted when her mother becomes pregnant. However, her mother gives birth to quintuplets and Jamie's life changes dramatically and she begins to resent her new siblings. She also discovers she might not want the same things for herself that her parents want for her. Because of the demands of having five babies in the house, her parents focus all of their attention on the quints: Adam, Becky, Charlie, Debbie, and Eddie. Jamie's parents hire a babysitter named Fiona to help take care of the quints, although she later resigns due to exhaustion. To help cover costs, Jamie's parents agree to let their babies star in a diaper commercial. Albert, a representative for the diaper company, works with Jamie's parents to devise ways to keep the quints popular. Jamie reluctantly joins her school's art class, taught by Mr. Blackmer (James Kall), and discovers that she enjoys it. When Adam becomes ill, Jamie discovers that she really does not mind the babies and that she does have the courage to let her parents know she has dreams of her own. Jamie's parents fire Albert after he suggests replacing Adam with a look-alike baby for an upcoming event. Adam recovers, and Jamie becomes upset when her parents forget about her art being displayed in the school's art show; they attend a dinner with the governor instead, but visit the school later after remembering the art show and she wins the blue ribbon.

Finstad was an Associate Producer. In 1988, Finstad wrote a cover story on Queen Noor of Jordan, the beautiful blond American who married King Hussein after graduating from Princeton's first class to admit women (\\"The Incredible Odyssey of Lisa Halaby\\").European Travel & Life, October 1988 It led to a contract for Finstad to write a biography of Queen Noor for Villard Books after the Gulf War. Finstad made numerous trips to the Middle East and elsewhere for her research. The manuscript was set aside for political reasons.West Central Tribune, 7.19.01 CBS later optioned the magazine piece. Finstad spent the next three years researching and writing Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley (1997), the first biography of Priscilla Presley. Finstad offered a detailed account of Priscilla Beaulieu's childhood, including Priscilla's discovery of her true father at eleven, her courtship by Elvis Presley when she was 14 years old, their marriage, and her management of Elvis Presley Enterprises after their divorce and his death. Child Bride was based on extensive interviews with Priscilla Presley, her family, her close friends, her classmates, her co-stars and numerous members of Elvis' circle in Memphis and Germany, including Currie Grant, a former Army buddy of Elvis, who introduced Priscilla to Elvis. Harmony/Crown published Child Bride in 1997; Century London published the book in the U.K. While Child Bride was on several cities' bestseller lists, Priscilla filed a lawsuit against Currie Grant, denying his claim that she had sex with him in exchange for introducing her to Elvis Presley. In the book, Finstad included excerpts from her taped joint interview with Grant and Priscilla Presley, who disagreed with certain points that Finstad had independently documented. Priscilla's suit resulted in a default judgment against Grant, whom Priscilla had sued for at least $10 million. He was ordered to pay $75,000. However, neither Finstad nor her publisher was a party to the lawsuit, and Finstad and her publisher say they stand by their account of the affair in the book.\\"We stand by the book completely,\\" Hilary Bass, a spokeswoman for Harmony Books, said... \\"It went through an extensive legal vetting.\\" See \\"Is It Getting Easier to Win Libel Suits?\\" Los Angeles Times, August 21, 1997.

Nicknamed the \\"Bahnsen Burner,\\" he once made 118 starts over a three-year stretch while playing with the Chicago White Sox in the mid-1970s. Career =New York Yankees= Bahnsen was drafted out of the University of Nebraska by the New York Yankees in the fourth round of the 1965 Major League Baseball Draft. After two seasons in the minor leagues, in which he went 12-9 with a 2.87 earned run average, he received his first call up to the majors in September . In four games with the Yanks, he was 1-1 with a save and 3.52 ERA. He earned an invitation to Spring training camp in , but was assigned to the triple A Syracuse Chiefs. After arriving at camp late due to an army commitment, Bahnsen was given a second chance at a roster spot in . He made the club, and proceeded to go 17-12 with a team best 2.05 ERA and struck out a career-high 162 batters to be named the American League Rookie of the Year. His finest performance of the season and only shutout came on August 1 against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. He struck out twelve, while allowing only three hits and walking no one. Bahnsen spent three more seasons with the Yankees, never matching his rookie success. Perhaps the most famous moment of his Yankee career from that point forward was a brawl with the Cleveland Indians Vada Pinson in which he was knocked down with one punch. Following the season, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox for infielder Rich McKinney. =Chicago White Sox= White Sox manager Chuck Tanner employed a unique strategy with his starting rotation for the season. Recognizing the talent he had at the top of his rotation, he started Wilbur Wood, Bahnsen or Tom Bradley as much as possible, leaving only 24 starts for the rest of the staff. The strategy worked, as the White Sox finished over .500 for the first time since , and in second place in the American League West. For his part, Bahnsen made 41 starts, and went 21-16 with a 3.60 ERA in his first season with the South Siders. The next season, Bahnsen made 42 starts, however his record dipped to 18-21 as the White Sox finished the season in fifth place. In one of those 18 wins, a 4-0 shutout over the Cleveland Indians on August 21 at Municipal Stadium, Bahnsen had a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth on a single by former teammate Walt Williams. Bahnsen made another 35 starts for the White Sox in . Along the way, he started another bench-clearing brawl; this time with the Kansas City Royals' John Mayberry. Coincidentally, Pinson was also a member of the Royals, and in the starting line-up that day. He had already made twelve starts in when he was dealt with Skip Pitlock to the Oakland Athletics for Chet Lemon and Dave Hamilton on June 15. In a little over three seasons in Chicago, Bahnsen made 130 starts, and was 55-58. =Oakland Athletics= After going 6-7 with a 3.24 ERA for the A's in 1975, he was reunited with former White Sox manager Chuck Tanner for . Tanner employed a similar strategy with the A's to that which he had with the White Sox, starting Vida Blue and Mike Torrez as much as possible. Bahnsen only made fourteen starts, seeing most of his work in relief. He went 8-7 with a 3.34 ERA for the season. Early into the season, he was traded to the Montreal Expos for first baseman Mike Jorgensen. =Montreal Expos= After making 22 starts for the Expos in 1977, Bahnsen became a full-time reliever in , making just one emergency start. He became a valuable member of the bullpen, collecting seventeen saves over the next four seasons with the Expos, and leading the team in innings pitched out of the bullpen in (94.1). =Career twilight= The Expos released Bahnsen at the end of Spring training, just as the season was set to begin. He joined the California Angels shortly afterwards, but was released after seven games with a 4.66 ERA on May 14. Shortly afterwards, he signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and went 4-3 with a 4.89 ERA for the triple A Oklahoma City 89ers. He appeared briefly with the Phillies that September, giving up just two earned runs in 13.1 innings pitched. After going 0-3 with a 9.59 ERA for the Pacific Coast League's Portland Beavers in , he retired. For his career, Bahnsen posted a 146-149 record. Other statistics: 574 games, 327 games started, 73 complete games, 16 shutouts, 90 games finished, 20 saves, 2,529 innings pitched, 2,440 hits allowed, 1,127 runs allowed, 1,013 earned runs allowed, 223 home runs allowed, 924 walks (59 intentional), 1,359 strikeouts, 34 hit batsmen, 89 wild pitches, 10,701 batters faced, three balks and a 3.60 ERA. Bahnsen has a career .117 batting average, and has driven in nineteen runs. His only career home run came on August 19, 1979 against the Atlanta Braves' Tony Brizzolara. In 1992 Bahnsen played for one season for the Dutch Major League Team Haarlem Nicols, two years before the team declared bankruptcy. https://dutchbaseballhangout.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/history-of- dutch-baseball-1980-2000/ Career after baseball Bahnsen works with the promotions department of MSC Cruises seeking and securing retired major league players to participate in activities on cruise ships such as autograph and story-telling sessions. He also works with 640 AM, a south Florida radio station that broadcasts Yankee games.

It debuted on Disney Channel on March 19, 2004. Plot Jason \\"Jace\\" Newfield (Andrew Lawrence) is the new blind student at his school, whose family recently moved from New York City to Salt Lake City, Utah. Thinking that his way to fit in is through playing the drums, he shows off in class only to find out that his band teacher, Mr. Wyatt, is also blind. He later finds out from one of his friends, Vincent \\"Fly\\" Shu, that the only way to fit in is to be a jock. However, his other friend, Mary Beth Rice, is becoming increasingly irritated by his \\"New Yorkers rule\\" jokes and tells him that the reason no one is willing to be his friend is not because he is blind but because he is acting like a jerk. So in an effort to help Jace fit in, she asks him to try out for the wrestling team. \\"Fly\\" unwillingly tries out for the team with Jace, and they both make it. Jace has trouble winning matches at first, but slowly starts improving after receiving lessons from Mary Beth, who's father is the coach of the wrestling team. Throughout the course of the season he slowly starts to fit in with some of the students that gave him a hard time at the beginning of his year at the school. At the end of the season, they go on to the state championship. It ends with a reporter interviewing Jace's teammates about his wrestling; they deny that he is even blind, because they realize that he is a significant person, and they accept him for who he is and not just a blind person, which is what they saw at first.

It contrasts with track I diplomacy, which is official, governmental diplomacy that occur inside official government channels.Kaye, 2007, p. 5. However, track two diplomacy is not a substitute for track one diplomacy. Rather, it is there to assist official actors to manage and resolve conflicts by exploring possible solutions derived from the public view and without the requirements of formal negotiation or bargaining for advantage.Montville, 1991, pp. 162‚Äì163. In addition, the term track 1.5 diplomacy is used by some analysts to define a situation where official and non-official actors cooperate in conflict resolution.United States Institute of Peace, Glossary of Terms for Conflict Management and Peacebuilding, \\"Tracks of diplomacy\\". History In 1981, Joseph V. Montville, then a U.S. State Department employee, coined the phrases Track One and Track Two diplomacy in \\"Foreign Policy According to Freud\\", which appeared in Foreign Policy (Davidson & Montville, 1981). Track One diplomacy was what diplomats did‚Äîformal negotiations between nations conducted by professional diplomats. Track Two diplomacy referred to conflict resolution efforts by professional non-governmental conflict resolution practitioners and theorists. \\"Track Two has as its object the reduction or resolution of conflict, within a country or between countries, by lowering the anger or tension or fear that exists, through improved communication and a better understanding of each other's point of view\\".McDonald & Bendahmane, 1987, p.1. The efforts of these conflict resolution professionals, generally operating through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and universities, arose from the realization by diplomats and others that formal official government-to-government interactions were not necessarily the most effective methods for securing international cooperation or resolving differences. > Track two diplomacy is unofficial, non-structured interaction. It is always > open minded, often altruistic, and ... strategically optimistic, based on > best case analysis. Its underlying assumption is that actual or potential > conflict can be resolved or eased by appealing to common human capabilities > to respond to good will and reasonableness. Scientific and cultural > exchanges are examples of track two diplomacy. The problem most political > liberals fail to recognize is that reasonable and altruistic interaction > with foreign countries cannot be an alternative to traditional track one > diplomacy, with its official posturing and its underlying threat of the use > of force. Both tracks are necessary for psychological reasons and both need > each other.Davidson & Montville, 1981, p. 155. Montville (Davidson & Montville, 1981) maintains that there are two basic processes in track two diplomacy. The first consists of facilitated workshops that bring members of conflicting groups together to develop personal relationships, understand the conflict from the perspective of others, and develop joint strategies for solving the conflict. The second process involves working to shift public opinion: \\"Here the task is a psychological one which consists of reducing the sense of victim hood of the parties and rehumanizing the image of the adversary\\".McDonald & Bendahmane, 1987, p. 10. Montville emphasized that Track Two Diplomacy is not a substitute for Track One Diplomacy, but compensates for the constraints imposed on leaders by their people's psychological expectations. Most important, Track Two Diplomacy is intended to provide a bridge or complement official Track One negotiations. Methods for conducting these activities are still evolving as is the thinking around which individuals‚Äîrepresenting various roles and functions in society and government‚Äîshould be included. Montville points out that \\"there is no evidence that conflict resolution workshops would work for the principal political leaders themselves‚Äîperhaps because they are too tough or even impervious to the humanizing process\\".McDonald & Bendahmane, 1987, p. 14. John McDonald (Sep 2003 ‚Äì Aug 2004) seconds this assumption but feels that it is merely because the leaders are stuck in rigid roles and politically have less access to fluidity than individuals further removed from the top echelon of government(McDonald, Sep 2003 ‚Äì Aug 2004). In 1986 John McDonald and Diane Bendahmane (1987) produced Conflict Resolution: Track Two Diplomacy, a book that compiled the thoughts of several Track One and Track Two professionals confirming the need for government to support, encourage, and work with Track Two. The Department of State refused to print the book for eighteen months because the Department has a strong defensiveness regarding its right, ability, and authority to conduct conflict resolution. The book was finally published in 1987 and states that > ... the official government apparatus for analyzing international security > issues and designing foreign policy has to equip itself to support and > benefit from track two diplomacy. As part of the process, government > analysts must improve their capabilities to understand how history, society, > culture, and psychology interact.Davidson & Montville, 1981, pp. 156‚Äì57. At a special briefing for representatives of non-governmental organizations, the U.S. Department of State's Deputy Director for Political Affairs in the Office of Iraq presented a plea for help from NGOs (Paul Sutphin, 2004). Acting under Secretary Colin Powell's initiative and authority, the State Department's Iraqi analysts explained their frustrations in conducting dialogue, developing grassroots relationships, and rebuilding infrastructure. Far from admitting that the State Department was limited in its right, ability, and authority to conduct conflict resolution, they admitted that they couldn't build relationships or spend money fast enough to rebuild Iraq in time to appease the Iraqis and needed help to do it. This may not be the ideal situation in terms of NGO and State Department cooperation. \\"Further Exploration of Track Two Diplomacy\\" was published in 1991 as an Occasional Paper (McDonald), and as a chapter in Timing the De-Escalation of International Conflicts (Kriesberg & Thorson, 1991). Moreover, in the same year, \\"The Arrow and the Olive Branch,\\" which was written as an article in The Psychodynamics of International Relations, Montville adds the third process in track two diplomacy. Aside from previous two processes of facilitating small workshops and influencing public opinion, he claims that the third process is cooperative economic development. Although it may not seem essential to conflict resolution, it is meaningful in the sense that it provides incentives, institutional support, and continuity to the political and psychological processes.Montville, 1991, pp. 163‚Äì164. In 1996 Dr. Louise Diamond and John McDonald published Multi-Track Diplomacy: A Systems Approach to Peace. Since then the model has been more robustly developed and the original second track has been expanded into nine tracks: peacemaking through diplomacy, conflict resolution, commerce, personal involvement, learning, advocacy, religion, funding, information.Institute for Multi-track diplomacy, \\"What is multi-track diplomacy?\\" One of the successful track two dialogue processes can be the Oslo Accords of 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO), which achieved some remarkable breakthroughs in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian relationship. The contacts began as a track two diplomacy, with an unofficial initiative by a Norwegian scholar, but had transitioned into track one diplomacy by the time it was finished, finalized with a handshake between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO head Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn.Montville, 2006, pp. 19‚Äì20. Another example can be the sustained Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group which begun in 1992. From 2003 to 2007 it partnered with Camp Tawonga to bring hundreds of adults and youth from 50 different towns in Palestine and Israel to successfully live and communicate together at the Palestinian-Jewish Family Peacemakers Camp‚ÄîOseh Shalom ‚Äì Sanea al-Salam.Peacemaker Camp 2007, website See also * Shuttle diplomacy Samir Ahmad Track Two Dialogue in India- Pakistan Context Notes References * Davidson, W.

The 27 was the last of the line of Nieuport \\"V-strut\\" single seat fighters that began with the Nieuport 10 of 1914. Operational examples supplemented the very similar Nieuport 24 and 24bis in operational squadrons in late 1917 and many would also be used as advanced trainers. Design and development The Nieuport 27's design closely followed that of the 24, sharing the same faired fuselage, rounded ailerons and half-heart shaped rudder.Davilla, 1997, p.400 The only externally visible changes from the 24 included the replacement of the fixed external wood Nieuport type sprung tailskid with an internally pivoted type, and the replacement of the single undercarriage axle that connected both wheels, with one that had a hinge along the centerline ‚Äì and one extra wire. By 1918, many Nieuport fighters were being used as advanced trainers, and the Le Rh√¥ne 9JB Rotary engine was often replaced by lower powered engines, such as the Le Rh√¥ne 9C.Varriale 2015, p.10 Operational Nieuport 27s in Italian and French service were armed with a synchronized, fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun occasionally supplemented with an overwing Lewis Gun mounted on one of several mountings. In British service with the Royal Flying Corps and later the Royal Air Force a Lewis Gun was mounted on a Foster mounting above the top wing. Nieuport produced a number of prototypes either contemporary to, or based on the Nieuport 27, including one with a Hispano-Suiza 8 V-8 inline engine that may have been designated the Nieuport 26, another with an enlarged 2 spar lower wing and a third with a redesigned front fuselage with a further simplified cabane structure, and a Vickers mounted on the forward port longeron. Development of the Nieuport 28, with ailerons moved to the two spar lower wing, rounded wingtips and a simplified fuselage structure, concluded further development of the 27 line. Operational history Godefroy passing through the Arc de Triomphe. Nieuport 27 drawing Despite being obsolescent before entering service, the type served with a large number of French A√©ronautique Militaire units, pending availability of the newer SPAD S.XIII. In protest of the deliberate humiliation of airmen being ordered to march rather than fly for the main French victory parade on the Champs √âlys√©es to celebrate the end of the First World War, Charles Godefroy flew a Nieuport 27 through the gap between the pillars of the Arc de Triomphe, three weeks after the official victory parade, on 7 August 1919, an act which was widely reported in contemporary newspapers. All Italian Nieuport 27s were imported from France. About 200Varriale 2015, p.32 Nieuport 27s were supplied to Italy as Nieuport-Macchi was already at capacity producing the Hanriot HD.1 under licence. The British Royal Flying Corps obtained 71 Nieuport 27s in 1917,Varriale 2015, p.31 supplementing or replacing earlier Nieuports. These were used until early 1918 when Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5As became available in sufficient numbers, with the final operational examples being used in Palestine, while others were used in secondary roles, in the UK for training and trials.Davilla, 1997, p.404 In 1918 the United States Army Air Service placed orders for 461 Nieuport 27 E.Is for use as advanced fighter-trainers, of which 287 were delivered.Varriale 2015, pp.9‚Äì10 The Japanese bought several pattern aircraft and from 1921 to 1923 built 102 aircraft, with production starting by the Army Supply Depot at Tokorozawa until taken over by the Nakajima Aircraft Company.

On the City's Atlas, it is split between Bryant and Windermere, but is generally recognized as a distinct neighborhood. The northern boundary is Northeast 65th Street. The southern and eastern boundary is Sand Point Way. The western boundary is 40th Avenue Northeast. Hawthorne Hills is bounded on the north by View Ridge, on the east by Windermere, on the south by Laurelhurst, and on the west by Bryant. There is a sign for the neighborhood along Sand Point Way. The neighborhood is named after Hawthorne Kingsbury Dent, a prominent Seattle insurance executive in the early 1900s who owned most of what is now named Hawthorne Hills. However, before Dent sold his land in 1928, the area around 40th Ave NE at NE 55th Street was marked on maps as Keith, named after settler Jacob Keith who owned land there from 1880 to 1887. Keith Station was a stop on the Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railroad, the site of which is now in the Burke-Gilman Playground Park just across the Burke-Gilman Trail from Metropolitan Market. According to a 2013 analysis by Seattle Met Magazine and Zillow of 101 Seattle neighborhoods, Hawthorne Hills has the second-highest median household income of any Seattle neighborhood ($111,671, behind only Laurelhurst), and ranks 6th of 98 in median home value. This analysis also indicated that Hawthorne Hills had the lowest crime rate of all 101 Seattle neighborhoods. Many streets in the neighborhood run against the standard north-south/west-east Seattle grid and are named after college towns (e.g., Stanford, Princeton, Purdue, etc.). University Circle Park, which has views to Downtown Seattle and the Space Needle, is at the center of these streets. The southern part of Hawthorne Hills includes a portion of the Burke-Gilman Trail. Hawthorne Hills is located about two miles east of the University District, and serves as a bedroom community for many University of Washington professors and staffers. The neighborhood is home to Seattle Fire Station 38, Metropolitan Market Sand Point, Bryant Neighborhood Playground, Burke-Gilman Playground Park, National Archives and Records, the Center for Spiritual Living, and Congregation Shaarei Tefilah-Lubavitch.

When her twin brother Andrew dislocates his knee just before a big race, their father is forced to go to Europe to find a replacement rider. In the meantime, Andrea secretly races in Andrew's place with her mother's help. The movie is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.  Plot  The fast-moving Carson family gets ready to take on their next challenge as eldest son Andrew (Trever O'Brien) gears up for a motocross race with the hopes of winning a corporate sponsorship. Twin sister Andrea \\"Andy\\" Carson (Alana Austin) finds herself in a bind when her love for motocross racing provokes her overprotective father, Edward (Timothy Carhart), who is averse to the idea of his daughter participating in such a dangerous sport and prefers that she stick to \\"girl things\\". When their parents are out of the house for the day, Andrea and Andrew decide to have a friendly race on the family track. While racing, Andrew loses control of his bike, causing him to be thrown off and crash, injuring his knee which renders him unable to race in the Cup. Edward is forced to quit his job, dipping into the family's finances to find a replacement rider from Europe. Fueled by her desire to get on the track and feeling guilty over her brother's injury, Andrea forms a plan to masquerade as her brother, to which Andrew reluctantly agrees. Andrea is \\"welcomed\\" by unfriendly competition and comes back home with a scrape on her arm, which makes her mother, Geneva (Mary-Margaret Humes), suspicious. After dragging the answer out of youngest son Jason (Scott Terra) and a whole night to think it over, Geneva secretly (and reluctantly) agrees to let Andrea race in Andrew's place. The catch, however, is that this all needs to happen behind Edward's back, and before he comes home with a replacement rider. Andrea and her mother arrive at the race venue and register under her brother's name, \\"Andy\\". In spite of her initial confidence, Andrea learns the hard way that competition is fierce, and finishes last in her first race. Thinking that Andrea is a guy, competitor Dean Talon (Riley Smith) takes notice when the \\"lapper\\" garners the attention of several young women, finding it unbelievable that a 125 rider is getting looks. Dean, knowing that \\"Andrew\\" needs help with riding, offers to help the rookie in exchange for advice on his crush, Faryn Henderson (Katherine Ellis). Andrea quickly finds herself falling for Dean, who she reluctantly helps win Faryn's shallow affection. Her training also pays off when she places 7th in a following race. She continues to improve and takes 1st place in the last race of the day to get an overall 3rd place finish. The celebrating is cut short by the arrival of her angry father who scolds Andrea for racing and Geneva for letting her. Edward has now found a replacement rider from France, Ren√© Cartier (Michael Cunio). He is poorly received by Andrea after he tries to hit on her and treats her brothers with disrespect. After some research, Andrea learns that Cartier has garnered a bad reputation for his harsh, underhanded and dangerous behavior on the track, but when Andrew brings it to Edward's attention, he says that an aggressive rider is what the family needs at the moment. Andrea finds no further solace when she finds Cartier talking with Art Henderson, a competitor, though she is only scolded by Edward when he sees the two of them arguing. Back at camp, the Carson family confront Edward for the way he's treating Andrea. He tries to defend himself, but Geneva and Andrew show him how much he's really hurting Andrea by behaving the way he is. Alone in his thoughts, Edward begins to realize how much racing really means to Andrea and the support the rest of the family has given her. He finds Andrea arguing with Cartier; Andrea says that she's only trying to help her family, and Cartier rudely tells her to back off before shoving her. Edward sees it, runs over to them and shoves Cartier back in retaliation before telling him off and firing him. He and Andrea then go for a walk, where Edward tells her that he is proud of her for bringing Carson Racing to where it is now. Andrea admits her only regret was that instead of Andrew that got injured, it was her. Edward tells her not to think about anything else, and allows her to race in the final heat. On the final race, Andrea and Cartier, now racing under Art Henderson Racing, find themselves fighting fiercely for the finish. When Cartier fumbles on a turn, Andrea takes the victory and finishes 1st. However, an angry Cartier exposes her during a live interview, much to the shock of the entire community and Dean's dismay. A heated argument between the Carson family and Art Henderson Racing gets under way about disqualifying Andrea by saying that a girl isn't allowed to compete, which Geneva argues, saying that she read the rules and it doesn't mention anywhere about girls not being allowed to race. Henderson then tries to argue that Andrea wasn't registered, and Geneva pulls out the registration form showing that Andrea did register under \\"Andy Carson\\", as it is short for Andrea. Barbara Rollins (Aloma Wright), the corporate CEO, expresses her inspiration at Andrea's actions, much to Henderson and Cartier's embarrassment. She is inspired that a woman \\"came on top in a man's sport,\\" and not only allows Andrea to retain her title, but also awards the entire Carson family a full factory sponsorship. Back at home, Geneva surprises the kids with the news that they have the privilege of hiring a 250 rider for the next race. She then tells the kids that someone is already interested in the job, and is at the house to interview. Upon walking outside, Andrea finds Dean who says that he heard they needed a 250 rider. Andrea then challenges him to a race; if he wins, he can be the new 250 rider. The movie ends with Dean and Andrea racing.

Work His work with Marc Culler related properties of representation varieties of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups to decompositions of 3-manifolds. Based on this work, Culler, Cameron Gordon, John Luecke, and Shalen proved the cyclic surgery theorem. An important corollary of the theorem is that at most one nontrivial Dehn surgery (+1 or ‚àí1) on a knot can result in a simply-connected 3-manifold. This was an important piece of the Gordon‚ÄìLuecke theorem that knots are determined by their complements. This paper is often referred to as \\"CGLS\\". With John W.

The census defined combined statistical area covers ten counties in three states ‚Äì Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas. As of census 2010 the MSA had a population of 1,324,108 . The Forrest City Micropolitan area was added to the Memphis area in 2012 to form the Memphis‚ÄìForrest City Combined Statistical area and had a population of 1,369,548 according to census estimates. The greater Mid-South area as a whole has a population of 2.4 million according to 2013 census estimates. This area is covered by Memphis local news channels and includes the Missouri Bootheel, Northeast Arkansas, West Tennessee, and North Mississippi. Regional identity The Memphis Metro area is known locally as the Mid-South. Culturally, the Memphis Metropolitan area is more associated with the Deep South and even more specifically the Mississippi Delta than it is the Upland South, which is the case with Tennessee's other large cities. Memphis, Tennessee, is the largest city in the Deep South, third largest in the Southeastern United States, and eighth largest in the Southern United States as a whole. African-Americans make up nearly half the population of the metro area. The Mid-South has the highest percentage of African-Americans of all large metro areas with at least a million people. It is second when metro areas of under a million people are factored in after the Jackson-Vicksburg- Brookhaven, MS Combined Statistical Area. The metro area is blue collar in nature and most of its growth can be attributed to its logistical infrastructure. Recently, however, more companies with technology backgrounds such as Electrolux and Mitsubishi have begun making inroads in the Memphis area. Economy The Memphis area enjoys a diverse and robust economy. Well positioned on America's largest river and located near the population center of the United States; Memphis is known as America's distribution hub. FedEx is headquartered in Memphis and uses the Memphis International Airport as its global superhub facility making the airport the busiest cargo airport in the United States. UPS also uses Memphis as a major hub. The area is also home to one of the United States largest intermodal logistics centers. This includes being the third largest trucking corridor, fourth largest inland port, and third largest in class I railroad services. The Mid-South has the largest percentage of people employed in logistics in the U.S. The Mid-South is also home to many fortune 500 and 1000 companies such as FedEx, AutoZone, Regions Bank, ServiceMaster, BUPERS, First Tennessee and International Paper. Furthermore, companies such as Nike, Baskin Robbins, Sharp, and Hewlett Packard operate large distribution centers out of Memphis. Healthcare has begun to play a major role in the Mid-South's economy accounting for one in nine jobs. There are nineteen hospitals with over 4,100 beds in the Mid-South. The area is also home to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a Nobel Prize winning hospital with over 1,200 scientists working there and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Tourism is also a major contributor to the Mid-South's economy with the region being known as the birthplace of Rock and Roll and Blues. Over eight million people visit the Memphis metropolitan area every year for tourist related activities. Over four million people visit Beale Street every year making it the most visited attraction in Tennessee. The Memphis Zoo is one of only four zoos in the U.S. to feature a giant panda and is routinely ranked as one of the best zoos in America. The Tunica casino resort area in Mississippi has over twelve million visitors annually and is the third largest gaming area in the U.S. after Las Vegas and Atlantic City. It also contains a lake beach at Sardis Lake near Batesville, Mississippi.

It features a \\"balanced\\" operating system, similar to that used in the AEK-971. In this case, the designation AK does not indicate Avtomat Kalashnikova but Alexandrov/Kalashnikov. The revised designation indicates the incorporation of a new gas system, designed by Youriy Alexandrov, for Kalashnikov-pattern rifles. These new rifles were derived from the AL-7 experimental rifle of the early 1970s. The AL-7 utilized an innovative balanced gas operating system known as the Balanced Automatics Recoil System (BARS) developed by Peter Andreevich Tkachev of TsNIITochMash that was first used earlier on the AO-38 assault rifle of 1965 that essentially eliminated felt recoil and muzzle rise. The system was modified by Alexandrov, then a junior engineer at Izhmash, and prototypes were produced under the designation AL-7. The AL-7 was considered too expensive for production at the time and the Soviet Army selected the AK-74 instead as the new service rifle. No further development occurred until the mid-1990s when Alexandrov, by then a senior engineer, was directed to update his design for production as a less expensive alternative to the AN-94. The new rifle differs only slightly from the original AL-7. The AK-107 receiver is not fluted and a three-round burst feature has been added. There is otherwise little difference between it and the AL-7 prototypes. Design details The AK-107, AK-108, and AK-109 represent a significant change to the Kalashnikov operating system originally designed in the late 1940s. This system uses a recoil-reducing countermass mechanism with two operating rods that move in opposite directions, thereby providing \\"balance\\". One operating rod, the upper, has a gas piston facing forward while the lower also has a gas piston. The gas tube at the forward end of the handguard is double-ended to accommodate the two rods. The enlarged gas tube cover of the upper handguard guides both rods in their travel. When the rifle is fired, gas is tapped from the gas port to enter the gas tube, driving the bolt carrier to the rear and the counter-recoil upper rail forward. The critical timing of the reciprocating parts is accomplished by a star-shaped sprocket that links and synchronizes both components, causing both to reach their maximum extension, or null point where forces are exactly equal, at exactly the same instant. The felt recoil is therefore eliminated, enhancing accuracy and assisting control during fully automatic fire. The travel distance of the AK-107 reciprocating parts is less than other Kalashnikov designs, so the cyclic rate is higher at 850‚Äì900 rounds/min rather than 600 rounds/min on other AK rifles. However, as the felt recoil is virtually eliminated, the manufacturer claims that accuracy is enhanced, especially during burst fire. An enhancement of 1.5 to 2 times, compared to the original AK-100 series, has been reported.Valery Shilin's Gun Club . The AK-107 is a selective fire weapon, with a three-round burst capability in addition to semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes. The system on the AK-107 resets to three-round burst each time the trigger is released, even if only one or two rounds were fired. External differences between the AK-107 and its predecessors are minor. They include a modified ejection port and a much thicker operating rod cover. The method of attaching the receiver cover now involves a rotating latch in place of the traditional Kalashnikov button at the rear of the receiver cover. The rear sight is also attached directly to the receiver cover rather than to the receiver itself and the selector has four positions instead of three. Optical and night sights can be installed, the rifle can also accept a 40 mm GP-25 grenade launcher. The AK-108 is a version of the AK-107 chambered in 5.56√ó45mm NATO, and the AK-109 is a less known and produced version chambered in 7.62√ó39mm.

The route serves the University of Arkansas, and thus a portion is named Razorback Road. Route description Garland Avenue runs through the north end of the University of Arkansas campus. The route begins at the northern end of Cato Springs Road under the I-49 overpass in south Fayetteville. The route runs briefly north with access to U.S. Highway 71 (US 71) with AR 265 before AR 265 becomes Cato Springs Road again and continues east. AR 112 continues north as Razorback Road and runs north to run concurrently with AR 16, starting near Baum Stadium and continuing until AR 180 (Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). AR 112 continues through the University of Arkansas campus, passing John McDonnell Field and Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium. After the stadium, AR 112 turns east and becomes West Maple Street and passes Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences and the Pat Walker Health Center. The highway turns north and becomes Garland Avenue, which is a median-divided highway until Highway 112S/Wedington Drive/North Street. The medians were added in 2009 after contention from the City of Fayetteville and residents. Ultimately, it was decided to have one continuous median that becomes a turn lane, with separate bike lanes on both sides. AR 112 continues north through Fayetteville, intersecting Wedington Drive just north of campus. The route continues as an important artery through the city, crossing I-49/US 62/US 71 south of the Fayetteville Teardrop (I-49 exit 67). AR 112 runs north from the expressway to Tontitown as Maestri Road, intersecting US 412 in Tontitown. Continuning north through Elm Springs as Elm St., the route enters Benton County. AR 112 runs north in a brief concurrency with AR 264 in Cave Springs before entering Bentonville and terminating at AR 12 near the Bentonville Municipal Airport. History Arkansas Highway 112 was one of the original 1926 state highways. Arkansas Highway 112 was one of the original 1926 state highways. The original AR 112 was unpaved and ran from Arkansas Highway 16 in Fayetteville north to an area south of Johnson. The route was paved in 1948, and extended north to Bentonville in 1951. The Cave Springs to AR 12 segment was paved at the time of addition, with the entire length becoming paved by 1956. Arkansas Highway 112S was created in 1971 from a segment of Arkansas Highway 16. The route was truncated to its current northern terminus in February 2012, the route formerly continued along Highway 12 and US 71B to terminate at Highway 72 in Bentonville. The route closely follows the same path it did during the Civil War and is designated as part of the Arkansas Civil War Trail. AR 112 is also designated as part of the Arkansas Trail of Tears northern route. Future Plans are underway to expand AR 112 to four lanes through the University of Arkansas campus. The project would be completed in summer sections when the student population has decreased, with the first portion for completion being widening from AR 180 north to Leroy Pond Drive. Right of way has already been obtained from the University for this part of the project. The segment of Highway 112 between Wedington Drive and Melmar Street is in the process of being widened to four lanes via transportation bond program funds.

His teacher, the noted artist John French Sloan, was a clear influence on Wehr, eschewing realism for the more authentic abstract communication of feeling and subject matter. Wehr used a variety of media to communicate his values of racial and social justice, beauty in nature, and the complexity of the human condition. His sculptures in metal painted in simple black and white, such as \\"Man Woman and Child,\\" articulate the interdependence, yet separateness of the members of the human family at a time when the nuclear family was the ideal of American culture. At a time of the powerful movement for racial equality, Mr. Wehr addressed racial tensions in ‚ÄúOppression‚Äù with its brutal juxtaposition of forms representing the subjection of African Americans in American society. It brings to mind the memorable photographs of police dogs and fire hoses assaulting black schoolchildren in the 1960s. A fire in 1947 destroyed Wehr's studio and two years of sculpting, save for a mahogany head sculpture of an African American man Wehr had sketched once on a New York City Subway trip. Collections and Research Mock-ups, patents, legal documents and other materials documenting Wehr's animated book creations are housed at the University of Virginia Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library.Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library In 2002, librarians Dr. Alan Boehm and Roy Ziegler received a $4,000 research grant from the Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) to \\"reconstruct the life and accomplishment of a forgotten master of American book artistry and animation,\\" Julian Wehr. \\"A Julian Wehr Miscellany: Unrecorded Animated Books, Foreign-Language Animated Books, and Other Works\\" was later published.

They are found in tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Lizardfishes are generally small, although the largest species measures about in length. They have slender, somewhat cylindrical bodies, and heads that superficially resemble those of lizards. The dorsal fin is located in the middle of the back, and accompanied by a small adipose fin placed closer to the tail. They have mouths full of sharp teeth, even on the tongue. Lizardfishes are benthic animals that live in shallow coastal waters; even the deepest-dwelling species of lizardfish live in waters no more than deep. Some species in the subfamily Harpadontinae live in brackish estuaries. They prefer sandy environments, and typically have body colours that help to camouflage them in such environments. The larvae of lizardfishes are free-swimming. They are distinguished by the presence of black blotches in their guts, clearly visible through their transparent, scaleless skin. Taxonomy Three genera of the Synodontidae are known to inhabit the western Atlantic, including Synodus, represented by six species, Saurida, represented by four species, and Trachinocephalus, represented by a single species. The six species comprising the genus Synodus are S. intermedius, S. saurus, S. synodus, S. foetens, S. bondi, and S. macrostigmus. The four species comprising the genus Saurida are S. umeyoshii, S. pseudotumbil, S. undosquamis, and S. tumbil. The single species of Trachinocephalus is T. myops.

The squadron was formed in 1942 and saw extensive action in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. It was disbanded in 1948, but reformed the following year and operated jet aircraft throughout the Cold War. The squadron was based at Malta from 1952 to 1954, flying de Havilland Vampires, and Malaysia from 1968 to 1983, with Dassault Mirage IIIs, before returning to Australia. The squadron was re-equipped with F/A-18 Hornet fighters and moved to RAAF Base Tindal in 1988. It was placed on alert to support the Australian- led INTERFET peacekeeping deployment to East Timor in 1999, and saw combat in 2003 as part of the Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq and in 2015 during the military intervention against ISIL. History Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk IA of No. 75 Squadron RAAF, which Flying Officer Geoff Atherton flew over New Guinea in August 1942 =Port Moresby and Milne Bay= In February and March 1942 the Allied position in New Guinea was under pressure and Japanese aircraft had been sighted over the Torres Strait Islands and Cape York in northern Australia. As a result, priority was given to basing a fighter squadron at Port Moresby in New Guinea to defend the town's important airfields and port facilities. The RAAF received an allocation of 25 P-40 Kittyhawk fighters in late February that were flown to Townsville, Queensland, and used to form No. 75 Squadron on 4 March 1942. The need to reinforce Port Moresby's defences was so pressing that the squadron was allowed only nine days to train with the aircraft before it deployed. Commanded initially by Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey, No. 75 Squadron's advance party arrived in Port Moresby on 17 March and its aircraft followed between the 19th (when Squadron Leader John Jackson assumed command) and 21st of the month. At this time only four of the squadron's 21 pilots, including its commander, had previously seen combat.Gillison (1962), pp. 457‚Äì459 No. 75 Squadron took part in the Battle of Port Moresby between March and April 1942. The squadron scored its first \\"kill\\" on the afternoon of 21 March when two Kittyhawks shot down a Japanese bomber which was conducting a reconnaissance of the town.Eather (1995), p. 82 On 22 March nine Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese airstrip at Lae, destroying 14 aircraft (including two during a dogfight) and damaging another five; two Australian aircraft were lost in this operation though another three crashed in separate accidents on 22 March. The Japanese launched a retaliatory raid on Port Moresby the next day.Gillison (1962), pp. 460‚Äì461 No. 75 Squadron was in action over Port Moresby or Lae almost every day during late March and April, and was generally outnumbered by Japanese aircraft.Eather (1995), p. 83 As well as mounting their own attacks on Japanese positions, the Kittyhawks also frequently escorted a squadron of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) A-24 Banshee dive bombers, which were stationed at Port Moresby.Gillison (1962), p. 543 No. 75 Squadron's casualties quickly mounted and were exacerbated by high rates of disease. Squadron Leader Jackson was shot down and killed on 28 April, shortly after he had destroyed a Japanese fighter.Stephens (2006), pp. 140‚Äì141 His younger brother Squadron Leader Les Jackson assumed command the next day. By the time two USAAF squadrons arrived to reinforce it on 30 April, No. 75 Squadron had been reduced to just three serviceable aircraft and a further seven Kittyhawks in need of repair. The squadron was withdrawn from operations on 3 May after losing two aircraft the day before. During its period at Port Moresby No. 75 Squadron was confirmed to have destroyed 35 Japanese aircraft, probably destroyed another four and damaged 44. The squadron suffered twelve fatalities and lost 22 Kittyhawks, including six in accidents.Gillison (1962), pp. 546‚Äì548 A No. 75 Squadron Kittyhawk at Milne Bay in September 1942 The squadron departed Port Moresby to return to Australia on 7 May 1942.Gillison (1962), p. 548 It was first located at Townsville and later moved to Kingaroy followed by Lowood to be re-equipped. During this period it also received a number of pilots who had served in Supermarine Spitfire-equipped squadrons in Europe. In late July the unit departed Queensland and returned to New Guinea.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 41 No. 75 Squadron arrived at Milne Bay on 31 July 1942 where it joined No. 76 Squadron, which was also equipped with Kittyhawks. At the time an Allied base was being developed at Milne Bay to both protect Port Moresby and mount attacks against Japanese positions in New Guinea and nearby islands. Japanese aircraft made their first major raid on Milne Bay on 11 August, which was intercepted by Kittyhawks from both No. 75 and No. 76 Squadrons. In mid-August the Milne Bay defenders were warned that they might be the target of a Japanese landing, and on 24 August Japanese barges were sighted heading for the area. These vessels were destroyed the next day on Goodenough Island by nine No. 75 Squadron Kittyhawks. However, on the night of 25/26 August another Japanese convoy landed an invasion force at Milne Bay.Gillison (1962), pp. 608‚Äì610 During the resulting Battle of Milne Bay the two Kittyhawk squadrons provided important support to the Allied defenders by heavily attacking Japanese positions and intercepting Japanese air raids on the area. On 28 August the Kittyhawks were withdrawn to Port Moresby when the Japanese troops came close to their airstrips, but they returned to Milne Bay the next day. No. 75 and No. 76 Squadrons later supported the Allied counter-offensive at Milne Bay which ended with the remaining Japanese troops being evacuated in early September.Eather (1995), pp. 83‚Äì84RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 41‚Äì42 Following the battle Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell, the commander of New Guinea Force, stated that the attacks made by the two squadrons on the day of the Japanese landing were \\"the decisive factor\\" in the Allied victory.Gillison (1962), p. 617 From 21 to 23 September No. 75 Squadron flew sorties in support of the 2/12th Battalion during the Battle of Goodenough Island.Gillison (1962), pp. 629‚Äì630 In late September the two Australian squadrons at Milne Bay were relieved by two USAAF squadrons, and No. 75 Squadron was redeployed to Horn Island.Gillison (1962), p. 620 It subsequently moved again to Cairns for a period of rest before returning to Milne Bay in February 1943,Eather (1995), p. 84 under the command of Squadron Leader Wilfred Arthur. During this deployment the squadron operated alongside No. 77 Squadron.Gillison (1962), p. 689 No. 75 Squadron flew patrols over Milne Bay and Goodenough Island, and on 14 May a mixed force of 17 Kittyhawks from it and No. 77 Squadrons inflicted heavy casualties on a force of 65 Japanese aircraft bound for Milne Bay while only a single Australian aircraft was lost. This was No. 75 Squadron's last major air battle of the war. From August to December the squadron was issued with two F-4 Lightning aircraft for photo reconnaissance tasks.Odgers (1968), p. 73 No. 75 Squadron moved to Goodenough Island in October 1943 to support the Allied offensive in the Louisiade Archipelago and New Britain.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 42 =Offensive operations= In 1944, Flying Officer T.R. Jacklin (pictured) flew this No. 75 Squadron P-40N-5 more than after losing the port aileron and 25% of its wing area to a direct hit from an artillery shell. In December 1943 No. 75 Squadron became part of No. 78 Wing, which in turn formed part of the newly established No. 10 Operational Group. This group had been formed to provide a mobile organisation capable of supporting the offensives in and around New Guinea which were planned for 1944.Odgers (1968), pp. 182‚Äì184 During the first half of 1944 the squadron frequently moved between air bases to support Allied operations and was based at Nadzab from January to March, Cape Gloucester from March to May, Tadji in May, Hollandia from May to June and Biak from June to July.Eather (1995), pp. 84‚Äì85 During this period its role was to provide close air support for Australian and US ground troops and protect Allied shipping from air attack.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 42‚Äì43 No. 75 Squadron was stationed at Noemfoor from July to November 1944 where it conducted long-range attacks on Japanese airstrips and shipping in the eastern islands of the Netherlands East Indies.Eather (1995), p. 85RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 43Wilson (2002), p. 113 No. 10 Operational Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) on 25 October 1944; at this time No. 75 Squadron continued to form part of No. 78 Wing alongside No. 78 and No. 80 Squadrons.Odgers (1968), pp. 298‚Äì299 The squadron was ordered back to Biak by 1TAF on 2 November to provide air defence for the island, to the displeasure of the pilots who considered that they were \\"being taken out of the war\\". Only 149 sorties were flown from Biak before No. 75 Squadron returned to Noemfoor on 11 December.Wilson (2002), p. 119 No. 75 Squadron and the rest of No. 78 Wing moved to Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies in late December 1944.Odgers (1968), p. 380 The squadron arrived at Morotai on 21 December and flew 147 operational sorties that month during attacks on Japanese positions in the nearby Halmahera islands.Wilson (2002), pp. 119‚Äì121 Attacks on Halmahera and other islands in the NEI continued in early 1945, and No. 75 Squadron also flew sorties in support of US troops who were attacking the remaining Japanese on Morotai. These and similar operations were seen as wasteful by many of 1TAF's fighter pilots and their leaders. On 20 April, eight officers including Wilf Arthur, now a group captain and No. 78 Wing's commander, attempted to resign in protest during the \\"Morotai Mutiny\\".Odgers (1968), pp. 443‚Äì445 No. 75 Squadron's commander landing his Kittyhawk at Tarakan From May 1945 No. 75 Squadron participated in the Borneo Campaign. While the squadron's ground crew landed on Tarakan with the invasion force in early May 1945, delays with repairing the island's airfield meant that its aircraft could not be deployed there until mid-July rather than 3 May as had been originally planned. During this period No. 75 Squadron's pilots remained at Morotai but conducted little flying, causing their morale to decline.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 43‚Äì44 Once established at Tarakan the Kittyhawks attacked targets near Sandakan and supported Australian forces during the Battle of Balikpapan in the war's last weeks.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 44 Following the Japanese surrender No. 75 Squadron flew reconnaissance patrols over prisoner of war camps and continued general flying. The Kittyhawks were later flown to Oakey, Queensland and the ground crew returned to Australia in December 1945 on board the British aircraft carrier . The squadron suffered 42 fatalities during World War II. =Cold War= From December 1945 to May 1946 No. 75 Squadron was maintained as a cadre located at Deniliquin and manned by one officer and three airmen without any aircraft. In May 1946 the squadron moved to RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney, but was not issued with any aircraft or further personnel until it moved to RAAF Base Williamtown in September that year and was equipped with P-51 Mustang fighters. No. 75 Squadron used these aircraft for routine training and exercises until it was disbanded on 25 March 1948. Four No. 75 Squadron pilots walking away from their Vampire fighters following an anti- shipping training exercise at Malta during July 1954 The squadron was re- formed at Williamtown on 24 January 1949 equipped with de Havilland Vampire jet fighters.Wilson (2002), p. 137 From 1949 to early 1952 No. 75 Squadron conducted training exercises, which included teaching new pilots to operate Vampires, as well as making acceptance flights of Vampires delivered to the RAAF.Wilson (2002), p. 139 During this period a key role for the squadron was training pilots for combat in the Korean War with the Gloster Meteor-equipped No. 77 Squadron.Wilson (2002), p. 141 In March 1952 the Australian Government decided to reform No. 78 Wing and deploy it to Malta where it would form part of a British force which sought to counter the Soviet Union's influence in the Middle East. No. 75 and No. 76 Squadrons were selected to form the wing's flying units, and they arrived at RAF Hal Far in Malta during July 1952 and were equipped with Vampires leased from the Royal Air Force (RAF). While based at Malta the wing took part in numerous training exercises in the Mediterranean region as well as Europe, including a large-scale NATO exercise in 1953 which involved 2,000 aircraft and 40,000 personnel. In addition, the wing participated in a royal review to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. No. 78 Wing moved to the RAF station at Ta' Qali in June 1953 where it remained until it returned to Australia in late December 1954. In preparation for its return to Australia No. 75 Squadron was disbanded in November 1954.Stephens (2006), pp. 221‚Äì223 No. 75 Squadron was reestablished at Williamtown in April 1955. It was initially equipped with Vampires and Gloster Meteor fighters, but these were replaced with CAC Sabre aircraft in early 1957.Wilson (2002), p. 158 While operating Sabres the squadron made a number of deployments to Darwin for air defence exercises which often involved RAF units.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 45 On 8 December 1958 No. 75 Squadron transferred from No. 78 Wing to become an independent unit under the direct command of RAAF Base Williamtown.Wilson (2002), p. 159 In November 1964 several of the squadron's pilots took part in an emergency deployment to Darwin when an Indonesian attack was feared as part of an apparent escalation of the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation.Wilson (2002), p. 165 A No. 75 Squadron Mirage III in 1988 The squadron became the first Australian fighter unit to be equipped with Dassault Mirage III fighters in December 1964 and was declared operational with these aircraft on 1 August 1967. It subsequently maintained a detachment of Mirages at Darwin from 2 May 1966 until early 1967.Wilison (2002), pp. 165 and 167 Following a period of training No. 75 Squadron transferred to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia during May 1967. From this base the squadron took part in regular exercises with the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and occasional exercises involving the RAF. No. 75 Squadron also trained with the United States Air Force and United States Navy on occasion, including the large-scale Cope Thunder series of exercises during which it deployed to Clark Air Base in the Philippines.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 45‚Äì46 Throughout its period based at Butterworth No. 75 Squadron deployed detachments of six Mirages to Tengah Air Base in Singapore on a rotational basis with No. 3 Squadron RAAF, with this responsibility swapping between the two units every three months.Wilson (2002), p. 180 In 1981 the Australian Government decided to withdraw a RAAF fighter squadron from Malaysia to Darwin pending the completion of RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine in the Northern Territory.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 46 No. 75 Squadron was the unit selected, and it arrived in Darwin in October 1983, becoming the first fighter squadron to be permanently based in the Northern Territory since World War II. The unit began to convert to F/A-18 Hornets in May 1988 and moved to Tindal in October that year. No. 75 Squadron also became part of No. 81 Wing during 1988. Tindal was close to the RAAF's newly developed Delamere Air Weapons Range and the squadron was assigned two GAF Nomad light transport aircraft between January 1989 and 1993 to fly supplies to the facilities there.Wilson (2002), pp. 199‚Äì200 and 222 =Current role= During late 1999 No. 75 Squadron was placed on alert to provide close air support and air defence to protect the international forces which had deployed to East Timor as part of INTERFET. However, despite the threat posed by Indonesian forces, ultimately they were not required.Wilson (2003), p. 32 An F/A-18 Hornet assigned to No. 75 Squadron during a deployment to Alaska in April 2008. The plane is marked with the tail flag of No. 77 Squadron. No. 75 Squadron saw action for the first time since 1945 as part of the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Australian Government announced that it would deploy a squadron of F/A-18s to the Middle East on 1 February 2003 and 14 No. 75 Squadron Hornets flew from Tindal to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar via Diego Garcia between 13 and 16 February.Holmes (2006), pp. 85‚Äì86 Following the outbreak of the Iraq War on 20 March the squadron was initially used to escort high-value Coalition aircraft such as tankers and E-3 Sentry aircraft. As it became clear that the Iraqi Air Force posed no threat, the role of No. 75 Squadron shifted to providing close air support to Coalition ground forces and air interdiction against Iraqi forces. These missions were initially flown in support of the US Army but the squadron was later switched to supporting the US Marine Corps. The squadron also supported the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment on 12 April when these units captured Al Asad Airbase. No. 75 Squadron flew its last combat sortie on 27 April. During the war the squadron flew 350 combat missions and dropped 122 laser-guided bombs. During these operations the squadron was augmented with pilots from No. 81 Wing's other F/A-18 squadrons. No. 75 Squadron's aircraft returned to Tindal on 14 May 2003 and its ground crew arrived there the next day.Holmes (2006), pp. 87‚Äì93 The squadron was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 27 November 2003 for \\"sustained outstanding service during warlike operations, in the Middle East Area of operations, over Iraq during Operation Falconer\\". In August 2005, a group of current and veteran members of No. 75 Squadron travelled to Papua New Guinea to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War, and the 63rd anniversary of the Battle of Milne Bay. As at 2011, No. 75 Squadron remained at Tindal and was the RAAF's largest F/A-18-equipped unit. The squadron regularly exercises with units from the RMAF, RNZAF, RSAF and US Military and conducts training using the facilities of the Delamere Air Weapons Range. As of 2014, No. 75 Squadron is scheduled to transition to Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters from late 2021. In March 2015, six F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron deployed to the Middle East during Operation Okra as part of the military intervention against ISIL. The aircraft replaced a detachment of six F/A-18F Super Hornets from No. 1 Squadron, and began flying combat operations late that month. The squadron was deployed to the Middle East until September 2015, when it handed over to the next rotation from No. 77 Squadron. The squadron's first F-35, A35-029, made its first flight from NASJRB Fort Worth, Texas in 2020.http://www.adf- serials.com.au/3a35.htm See also *McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet in Australian service Notes References   75 Military units and formations established in 1942 Recipients of the Meritorious Unit Citation Military Units in Northern Territory ","title":"No. 75 Squadron RAAF"},{"id":"3520987","text":"The New Jersey State Prison (NJSP), formerly known as Trenton State Prison, is a state men's prison in Trenton, New Jersey operated by the New Jersey Department of Corrections. It is the oldest prison in New Jersey and one of the oldest correctional facilities in the United States. It is the state's only completely maximum security institution, housing the most difficult and/or dangerous male offenders in the inmate population. NJSP operates two security units and provides a high level of custodial supervision and control. Professional treatment services, such as education and social work, are a priority at the facility. The Bureau of State Use Industries operated the bedding and clothing shops that were once located in Shop Hall at the facility. These industries have been relocated to South Woods State Prison. NJSP also housed New Jersey's death row for men and execution chamber until the state abolished capital punishment in 2007. Its inmates include John Martini, who was condemned for the kidnapping and murder of a Bergen County businessman, and Jesse Timmendequas, who was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of 7-year-old Megan Kanka. This crime inspired the passing of Megan's Law, which requires communities to be notified when a convicted sex offender moves into their area. History New Jersey State Prison is a complex that consists of three separate but interconnected physical plants from three different eras of prison construction that took place on the property. The three sections are the 1798 Penitentiary House, the 1832 Fortress Penitentiary, and the 1982 contemporary prison facility. The 1798 NJ Penitentiary House, which was the first State Prison in New Jersey and the third in the nation after the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia and Newgate in New York City is also the oldest building still in operation as part of an active, working prison in the United States. This allows NJSP to lay claim to being the oldest continuously operating State Prison in the US. The only surviving portion of the 1798 Penitentiary House is the original Front House, which functioned originally as the living quarters for the Keeper of the State Prison, the four Assistant Keepers (The first 4 men who served in the capacity of what are known today as State Correction Officers), the Armory, administrative office space on the first floor and a row of cells for the confinement of disruptive prisoners in the basement. Since the Penitentiary House stopped housing prisoners within a few years after the 1832 Fortress Penitentiary opened, Auburn Correctional Facility can lay claim to having the oldest continuously operating cell house in the US. After completion and the relocation of the Penitentiary House inmates to the new Fortress Penitentiary compound in 1836, the 1798 facility alternately served as the Mercer County jail facility during construction of their Workhouse in Titusville, NJ, and then as the State Arsenal until 1929, when all National Guard equipment and services that were based there were transferred to the newly completed ANG base at Sea Girt, at which time control of the empty compound was returned to the State Prison. In 1930, all of the Penitentiary House buildings were demolished, with the exception of the Front House, which was remodeled into a residence for the Keeper of the State Prison, a use for which it is still designated today. The cleared land on which the Penitentiary House cell houses and shop buildings had stood previously were enclosed in a 22 foot high reinforced concrete wall and opened as the Big Yard in 1930. This new, large recreation yard eased the cramped conditions inside the walls of the main compound, which up until that time had limited space to devote to outside recreation. The second oldest portion of New Jersey State Prison, the Fortress Penitentiary, was constructed between 1832 and 1836, when the inmates from the Penitentiary House next door were moved over. The 1832 facility was constructed on a contiguous plot of land already owned by the State and controlled by the Penitentiary House, under the supervision of the Keeper of the State Prison, and made use of inmate labor during the four years of construction. Consequently, the 1836 Fortress Penitentiary compound is considered to be an addition to the existing State Prison on the property. This assertion is valid because the two compounds coexisted on the same property and were managed and controlled by the Keeper as a prison complex in which the same inmate population worked and were housed. As the State Prison is operated as a unified complex composed of separate distinct compounds today, this conclusion is defensible. Prison in 1917 In his 1917 Master's Thesis, published as \\"History of the Penal, Reformatory and Correctional Institutions of New Jersey\\" the late Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes, the noted American historian published a history and analysis of the State Prisons, Reformatories and Penal Institutions of NJ up to that time. His work was an analysis of the application of the various penal philosophies and their successes, failures and changes from 1798 to 1917. He separated the Penitentiary House and the 1832 Fortress Penitentiary into two \\"Systems\\" in this work. The term \\"System\\" as used by Dr. Barnes was at that time used as we use \\"Paradym\\" today- His \\"First Prison System in NJ\\" as applied to the Penitentiary House and \\"Second Prison System in NJ\\" as applied to the 1832 facility did not describe two separate prisons nor did it indicate two separate prison agencies. This was a history and description of New Jersey's transition away from the Congregate System of confinement, wherein all persons regardless of age, sex or mental state were simply confined in the Penitentiary House, to the Pennsylvania System of confinement, which consisted of keeping prisoners confined in single cells, completely isolated from other prisoners and the Keepers. The authority and management of the State Prison as an agency did not change ‚Äì The Keeper as the agency head supervised the Penitentiary House, oversaw and contributed inmate labor to the construction of the Fortress Penitentiary between 1832 and 1836, and supervised the transfer of all inmates from the old to the new compound in 1836 and continued on in the new compound. This construction, transfer and continuation of operations from one side of the property to the other provides a link between the old and new compounds, and demonstrates that the New Jersey State Prison has existed and continuously operated in the same location since 1798. Thus, Dr. Barnes described a change in penal theory and practice, not the abolition of the old buildings and governing agency and the substitution of a new one. No break in operation or management occurred. The 1832 facility was expanded several times throughout the 19th Century with new construction adding wings in the years between 1859 and 1907, and larger Shop Hall buildings as well. In 1895‚Äì96 when 6 Wing was constructed, the original walls were extended to the corners of the old Penitentiary House compound to enclose that wing as well as the newer Shop Hall building, which heretofore had been outside the main walls. Capital Punishment was moved from the County Jails to NJ State Prison in 1907, when the first execution was carried out using the new Electric Chair, built by Carl Adams of Trenton, in the shops of his Adams Electric Company. The last such electrocution took place in 1963. In 1979 the Death House (8 Wing), along with the old Hospital wing were demolished to make way for a new Gymnasium. Ground was broken for the contemporary facility in 1979, and it was completed in 1982. No additions have been made since that time. Death row Prior to the 2007 repeal of the death penalty, the death row for men and execution chamber was in the Capital Sentence Unit (CSU) at the New Jersey State Prison. This unit was first established in 1907. The first death by electrocution occurred on December 11, 1907.\\"Historical Data on Capital Sentence Unit at New Jersey State Prison\\" (Archive).

It is located about 100 km SE of Kanton Island and 90 km WNW of Rawaki Island, formerly known as Phoenix Island. It lies at . Birnie island measures only 1.2 km long and 0.5 km wide. There is no anchorage, but landing can be made on the lee beach. The island is designated as the Birnie Island Wildlife Sanctuary. Kiribati declared the Phoenix Islands Protected Area in 2006, with the park being expanded in 2008. The 164,200-square-mile (425,300-square-kilometer) marine reserve contains eight coral atolls including Birnie Island. 800px Map of Birnie Island, Phoenix Islands, Kiribati Flora and fauna Birnie Island is low and dry, with a small, shallow lagoon in its southeast sector which is all but dried up. It is treeless, covered mostly with low shrubs and grasses, and was once home to a colony of rabbits, which have since been eradicated. Because of the undisturbed nature of the island, its vegetation, and the large colonies of seabirds which roost there, Birnie Island was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1975. It now forms () part of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, one of the world's largest marine protected area. An expedition to carry out eradication of the population of Polynesian rat on Birnie Island was carried out in 2011. History Birnie Island was discovered in 1823 by the London whaling ship Yoy, T. Edit, Master and named after the ship's owner, the London firm Alexander McBirnie & Co. It is rumoured when he first discovered the island he exclaimed ‚Äúahoy‚Äù. In the 1860s, the island was claimed under the Guano Islands Act for the United States, though there is no evidence of guano ever being mined there. Only large amounts of Yoy, and some ahoy. On July 10, 1889, the British flag was raised, and the island was declared a protectorate of the U.K. A colony was considered but never attempted. Mainly due to the large amounts of feral asstents the litter the land. In 1899, the island was leased to the Pacific Islands Company, Ltd. In 1916, it was included among the islands leased for 87 years to Captain Allen of the Samoan Shipping and Trading Company. This lease was taken over by the Burns Philp (South Sea) Company. During all this time, no guano was mined on Birnie, and no human use seems to have been made of it. Birnie Island became part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony in 1937, which belonged to the British, and then became part of Kiribati in 1979 when the country gained independence. The US gave up its claim in favor of Kiribati in the 1979 Treaty of Tarawa. Birnie is rarely visited today, though a New-Zealand funded scientific expedition to rid the island of rats and other invasive animal species was carried out in 2008.

The school was started in 2002 as a partnership between Guilford College and Guilford County Schools as the first early college high school in North Carolina, allowing students to graduate with a high school diploma and up to two years of college credit from Guilford College. The school practices a difficult selection method for admissions. Prospective students must submit a written application and participate in an on-campus examination created by the school's admissions team, currently involving an essay and multiple-choice mathematics and reading portion. In 2010, Newsweek magazine listed ECG as one of \\"The Nation's Most Elite Public High Schools\\". Newsweek also ranked ECG at 5th on its annual list of America's Best High Schools in 2016, making it the top high school in North Carolina in 2016. History In the first few months of ECG's existence, Principal Tony Burks II surveyed the students to choose a mascot and school colors. Phoenix was selected as the school's mascot, and burgundy and pewter were chosen as the school's colors. Late in the spring of 2008, the administration of ECG began to implement new changes in the structure and function of ECG, including advanced physical education, as well as changes in expulsion policies and altering the function of the student court. These choices were made in response to the academic stress of sophomore students who often took upwards of four or five AP Classes courses. More non- Advanced Placement courses were added to encourage a more relaxed environment. The application process was also overhauled and no longer includes an interview with prospective students. The current memorandum of understanding between Guilford College and Guilford County Schools to operate the school (effective July 2015) provides that GCS must pay to the college a base amount of $5,759.03 per each student enrolled in college courses (upperclassmen), plus the costs of textbooks to which they retain title. The contract is automatically renewed every year unless either party terminates it; the per- seat tuition cost is increased by the average legislated percentage increase in salaries of North Carolina Department of Public Instruction teachers each year unless agreed otherwise. In 2016 the US Department of Education named ECG a National Blue Ribbon School in the Exemplary High Performing Schools category.  Campus  ECG is located on the campus of Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina. Students have access to almost all of the Guilford facilities with the exception of dormitories. The school has a long-standing and policy against students entering dormitories. Through ECG's history ninth and tenth grades classes have been held in places including the basement of the Frank Family Science Center, Bauman Hall, and a former laundry facility known as Frasier. Currently, those classes are held in the two on-campus modular buildings that comprise eight classrooms total. GCS-owned modular buildings southwest of Quadrangle Dr and George Fox Rd on the Guilford campus.330x330px Academics Students at the Early College at Guilford follow a rigorous academic schedule throughout all four years. Freshmen are required to take the PSAT while Sophomores are required to take both the Pre- ACT and the March SAT. Although Juniors and Seniors take actual college classes, most students say that sophomore year is the hardest with a very rigorous and mentally stressing schedule with up to 7 AP courses in both semesters, AP US History, AP Environmental Science, AP English Language and Composition, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Psychology and AP Statistics. However, upperclassmen generally find time to enjoy themselves and are involved in multiple in-school and out-of-school activities. Underclassmen (Freshmen and Sophomores) take almost all honors and AP classes. Classes are taught on a modified block schedule with holidays that align with Guilford County School's schedule. Upperclassmen have dual enrollment; they are enrolled in both the Guilford County school system as juniors (and then seniors), and in Guilford College as freshmen (and then sophomores in their second year). Often, the number of AP Classes taken as underclassmen allows students to register as Sophomores and Juniors at Guilford. Juniors and Seniors take Guilford College classes, which count towards their remaining high school credits, and can often be transferred to other educational institutions. If a student remains at Guilford College after graduating from the Early College, the credits they received for their two final years will transfer towards their undergraduate requirements. The Early College at Guilford has been recognized as one of the nation's top public high schools by Newsweek Magazine. The Early College ranked fourteenth in 2007 and twenty- first in 2008 on a list of 1300+ public high schools. In the US News \\"Best High Schools of 2009\\", The Early College ranked seventeenth out of 20,000+ schools examined. In 2016, the US News ranked the Early College at Guilford first in North Carolina, second in the nation out of the best 500 public schools for STEM related fields, and #23 in the nation overall. The Early College at Guilford has about one-fourth of its students each year be named semi-finalists for the National Merit Scholarship. Culture and extracurricular activities Due to the discrepancy between the required \\"seat time\\" for a high school diploma in Guilford County and the actual time spent in class in a college setting, juniors and seniors must make up the difference with mandatory volunteer work. A license was since issued that nulls the \\"seat time\\" rule for ECG juniors and seniors, but upperclassmen are still required to complete a certain amount of volunteer work each academic year. Both underclassmen and upperclassmen participate in Early College clubs, usually held after underclassmen classes. Clubs include an Interact Club, Math Team, SAI Service club, five FIRST Robotics teams (under the umbrella of ECG Robotics, Inc.), Academic Quiz Bowl team, Student Council, Student Human Relations Committee, EducateUS, Science Olympiad, Yearbook Committee, and Speech and Debate Club. ECG's disciplinary system originally included the notable Student Court, a collection of students responsible for designating punishments to their fellows who had committed some error. In the late spring of 2008, however, the role of the student court in disciplinary action was abolished. The Early College at Guilford does not have any traditional sports teams, due to the school's small size. There is, however, an unofficial ultimate team that occasionally plays other high schools in friendly matches, as well as a foundling basketball team which competes with other Middle and Early Colleges in the area. In addition, students may choose to play sports at the school they are districted for. Traditions Guilford College is founded on Quaker principles, and encourages its professors and students to speak on a first-name basis. This is acknowledged by the administrators of Early College by allowing the students to address them by first name only when the eleventh grade has been reached and they have become part of the Guilford College community.

It was recorded in December 1989 during a reunion performance by the band's 1980‚Äì81 lineup. Background and recording Return to the Black Hole captures the second time that the Adolescents' early lineup had reunited. This lineup‚Äîsinger Tony Brandenburg (here credited by the stage name Tony Adolescent), bassist Steve Soto, drummer Casey Royer, and guitarist brothers Rikk and Frank Agnew‚Äîhad recorded the band's debut album, 1981's Adolescents, also known as The Blue Album. Rikk Agnew had left the band a few months after the album's release and was replaced, first by Pat Smear and then by Steve Roberts, and the Adolescents had recorded the Welcome to Reality EP before breaking up in August 1981. The Blue Album lineup had reunited for a performance in April 1986 that led to the band re-forming, but Frank Agnew had left after a few months and Royer had left that August. They were replaced, respectively, by Agnew's younger brother Alfie Agnew and by former Mechanics drummer Sandy Hanson for the album Brats in Battalions (1987). Alfie Agnew left by the end of 1986 and was replaced by Dan Colburn, but both he and Brandenburg left the band by the end of 1987. With Frank Agnew rejoining, the Adolescents had issued one more album, 1988's Balboa Fun*Zone, with Soto and Rikk Agnew sharing lead vocal duties, before disbanding in April 1989. The Blue Album lineup reunited in December 1989 for a show at the Reseda Country Club, which is the performance presented on Return to the Black Hole. This reunion did not lead to a re-formation of the band, as their 1986 reunion had. Instead, the members remained active in other projects: Soto formed the parody group Manic Hispanic in 1992, and he, Frank Agnew, and former Adolescents drummer Sandy Hanson simultaneously formed Joyride. Agnew soon left to focus on his family life and maintained a low-profile musical career in subsequent years, playing on albums by Tender Fury, Rule 62, and Mr. Mirainga. Soto and Hansen continued with Joyride until 1996, then formed the band 22 Jacks. Royer, meanwhile, resumed his other band, D.I., while Brandenburg started a new group, Sister Goddamn, and Rikk Agnew briefly rejoined the gothic rock band Christian Death and released two solo albums in the early 1990s. In 1992, Brandenburg and Rikk and Frank Agnew joined other Southern California punk musicians for Pinups, an album of cover versions of punk rock songs from the 1970s and early 1980s on which Soto sang backing vocals. Brandenburg, Royer, and Rikk Agnew also formed ADZ; the group's name was a shortened form of Adolescents. Royer and Agnew both left ADZ after the band's first album, Where Were You? (1992), and Brandenburg kept the group going throughout the 1990s with other members. By the time Return to the Black Hole was released in September 1997, Soto was active in 22 Jacks and Brandenburg in ADZ, Frank Agnew was doing occasional studio work as a producer and guest musician, and Royer and Rikk Agnew had both reduced their musical activities due to substance abuse issues: Royer was addicted to heroin, while Agnew abused a variety of drugs and drank alcohol excessively throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, becoming obese in the process. The Adolescents' Blue Album lineup would reunite again in 2001, leading to a relaunch of the band. Reception Jack Rabid of AllMusic rated Return to the Black Hole 3 stars out of 5, saying \\"Not only does Return present a group of not-so-adolescent late twenty-somethings who play their instruments better than in the band's old days ‚Äî the sheer glee of firing off together again is evident. This rips. This shreds. This blasts. You don't even need to know that this group helped kick off the second wave of punk in Southern California; having initially been outsold only by the Dead Kennedys, they were as popular as Circle Jerks, Black Flag, T.S.O.L., Youth Brigade, Channel 3, Agent Orange, and the young Social Distortion and Bad Religion. All you have to do is take in the might of the soaring leads more or less pioneered by Rikk Agnew and his brother Frank, even more thick and stinging live, and you understand.

It is also called the NpT-ensemble, where the number of particles N , is also kept as a constant. This ensemble plays an important role in chemistry as chemical reactions are usually carried out under constant pressure condition. The NPT ensemble is also useful for measuring the equation of state of model systems whose virial expansion for pressure cannot be evaluated, or systems near first-order phase transitions. Derivation of Key Properties The partition function for the NpT-ensemble can be derived from statistical mechanics by beginning with a system of N identical atoms described by a Hamiltonian of the form mathbf{p}^2/2m+U(mathbf{r}^n) and contained within a box of volume V=L^3. This system is described by the partition function of the canonical ensemble in 3 dimensions: :Z^{sys}(N, V, T) = frac{1}{Lambda^{3N} N!} int_0^L ... int_0^L dmathbf{r}^N exp(-beta U(mathbf{r}^N)) , where Lambda = sqrt{h^2 beta/(2 pi m)} , the thermal de Broglie wavelength (beta=1/k_B T , and k_B , is the Boltzmann constant), and the factor 1/N! (which accounts for indistinguishability of particles) both ensure normalization of entropy in the quasi-classical limit. It is convenient to adopt a new set of coordinates defined by mathbf{s}_i = L mathbf{r}_i such that the partition function becomes :Z^{sys}(N, V, T) = frac{V^N}{Lambda^{3N} N!} int_0^1 ... int_0^1 dmathbf{s}^N exp(-beta U(mathbf{s}^N)) . If this system is then brought into contact with a bath of volume V_0 at constant temperature and pressure containing an ideal gas with total particle number M such that M-N gg N, the partition function of the whole system is simply the product of the partition functions of the subsystems: :Z^{sys+bath}(N, V, T) = frac{V^N(V_0-V)^{M-N}}{Lambda^{3M} N!(M-N)!} int dmathbf{s}^{M-N} int dmathbf{s}^N exp(-beta U(mathbf{s}^N)) . The system (volume V) is immersed in a much larger bath of constant temperature, and closed off such that particle number remains fixed. The system is separated from the bath by a piston that is free to move, such that its volume can change. The integral over the mathbf{s}^{M-N} coordinates is simply 1. In the limit that V_0 rightarrow infty, M rightarrow infty while (M-N)/V_0=rho stays constant, a change in volume of the system under study will not change the pressure p of the whole system. Taking V/V_0 rightarrow 0 allows for the approximation (V_0-V)^{M-N} = V_0^{M-N} (1-V/V_0)^{M-N} approx V_0^{M-N}exp(-(M-N)V/V_0) . For an ideal gas, (M-N)/V_0 = rho = beta P gives a relationship between density and pressure. Substituting this into the above expression for the partition function, multiplying by a factor beta P (see below for justification for this step), and integrating over the volume V then gives :Delta^{sys+bath}(N, P, T) = frac{beta P V_0^{M-N}}{Lambda^{3M}N!(M-N)!}int dV V^N exp({-beta P V}) int dmathbf{s}^N exp(-beta U(mathbf{s})) . The partition function for the bath is simply Delta^{bath}=V_0^{M-N}/[(M-N)!Lambda^{3(M-N)}. Separating this term out of the overall expression gives the partition function for the NpT- ensemble: :Delta^{sys}(N, P, T) = frac{beta P}{Lambda^{3N}N!} int dV V^N exp(-beta P V) int dmathbf{s}^N exp(-beta U(mathbf{s})) . Using the above definition of Z^{sys}(N,V,T), the partition function can be rewritten as :Delta^{sys}(N, P, T) = beta P int dV exp(-beta P V) Z^{sys}(N, V, T) , which can be written more generally as a weighted sum over the partition function for the canonical ensemble :Delta(N, P, T) = int Z(N, V, T) exp(-beta PV ) C dV. ,; The quantity C is simply some constant with units of inverse volume, which is necessary to make the integral dimensionless. In this case, C=beta P, but in general it can take on multiple values. The ambiguity in its choice stems from the fact that volume is not a quantity that can be counted (unlike e.g. the number of particles), and so there is no ‚Äúnatural metric‚Äù for the final volume integration performed in the above derivation. This problem has been addressed in multiple ways by various authors, leading to values for C with the same units of inverse volume. The differences vanish (i.e. the choice of C becomes arbitrary) in the thermodynamic limit, where the number of particles goes to infinity. The NpT- ensemble can also be viewed as a special case of the Gibbs canonical ensemble, in which the macrostates of the system are defined according to external temperature T and external forces acting on the system mathbf{J}. Consider such a system containing N particles. The Hamiltonian of the system is then given by mathcal{H}-mathbf{J} cdot mathbf{x} where mathcal{H} is the system's Hamiltonian in the absence of external forces and mathbf{x} are the conjugate variables of mathbf{J}. The microstates mu of the system then occur with probability defined by :p(mu,mathbf{x})=exp[-beta mathcal{H}(mu)+beta mathbf{J} cdot mathbf{x}]/mathcal{Z} where the normalization factor mathcal{Z} is defined by :mathcal{Z}(N, mathbf{J}, T)=sum_{mu,mathbf{x}} exp[beta mathbf{J} cdot mathbf{x} - beta mathcal{H}(mu)]. The NpT-ensemble can be found by taking mathbf{J}=-P and mathbf{x}=V. Then the normalization factor becomes :mathcal{Z}(N, mathbf{J}, T)=sum_{mu, {mathbf{r}_i} in V} exp[-beta P V - beta(mathbf{p}^2/2m+U(mathbf{r}^N))] , where the Hamiltonian has been written in terms of the particle momenta mathbf{p}_i and positions mathbf{r}_i. This sum can be taken to an integral over both V and the microstates mu. The measure for the latter integral is the standard measure of phase space for identical particles: textrm{d} Gamma_N = frac{1}{h^3N!}prod_{i=1}^N d^3mathbf{p}_i d^3mathbf{r}_i. The integral over exp(-beta mathbf{p}^2/2m) term is a Gaussian integral, and can be evaluated explicitly as : int prod_{i=1}^N frac{d^3mathbf{p}_i}{h^3}expbigg[-beta sum_{i=1}^N frac{p^2_i}{2m}bigg] = frac{1}{Lambda^{3N}} . Inserting this result into mathcal{Z}(N,P,T) gives a familiar expression: :mathcal{Z}(N, P, T) = frac{1}{Lambda^{3N}N!} int dV exp(-beta P V) int dmathbf{r}^N exp(-beta U(mathbf{r})) = int dV exp(-beta P V)Z(N, V, T) . This is almost the partition function for the NpT-ensemble, but it has units of volume, an unavoidable consequence of taking the above sum over volumes into an integral. Restoring the constant C yields the proper result for Delta(N, P, T). From the preceding analysis it is clear that the characteristic state function of this ensemble is the Gibbs free energy, :G(N, P, T) = - k_B T ln Delta(N, P, T) ;, This thermodynamic potential is related to the Helmholtz free energy (logarithm of the canonical partition function), F,, in the following way: : G = F+PV. ;, Applications *Constant-pressure simulations are useful for determining the equation of state of a pure system. Monte Carlo simulations using the NpT-ensemble are particularly useful for determining the equation of state of fluids at pressures of around 1 atm, where they can achieve accurate results with much less computational time than other ensembles. *Zero-pressure NpT-ensemble simulations provide a quick way of estimating vapor-liquid coexistence curves in mixed-phase systems. *NpT- ensemble Monte Carlo simulations have been applied to study the excess properties and equations of state of various models of fluid mixtures. *The NpT-ensemble is also useful in molecular dynamics simulations, e.g. to model the behavior of water at ambient conditions.

Also known as the Kaiser, it is grown in Europe, Australia, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada, and the northwestern U.S. states of California, Washington, and Oregon. The Beurre Bosc was cultivated first in France. The name Bosc is given after a French horticulturist named Louis Bosc. Characteristic features are a long tapering neck and russet skin. Famous for its warm cinnamon color, the Bosc pear is often used in drawings, paintings, and photography due to its shape. Its white flesh is denser, crisper and smoother than that of the 'Williams' or 'D'Anjou' pear. It is called the \\"aristocrat of pears\\". It is suitable to be used in poaching.  History  The origin of Bosc pears is unclear, whether it is Belgium or France. The first time that Bosc Pears were seen was in the early 1800s.  Season  The season of Bosc pears starts in Autumn, all the way through Spring.  Taste and ripeness  Bosc pears are characterised for their hard flesh and brown skin. Moreover, at one point in their ripeness cycle they tend to be juicy, crunchy and sweet. Once they have reached their state of full ripeness the flavour of Bosc pears tends to be sweeter, while the texture becomes softer and wrinkly. One aspect that shows when Bosc pears are totally ripened can be found in the top part of the fruit, when its skin becomes wrinkly. Extra fancy and fancy grade of bosc pear in Canada should be at least 54 mm in diameter. They should be smooth, clean and well formed.  Nutrition  Most pears are a good source of fibre. A medium size pear can provide six grams of fibre. Pears are also a source of vitamin C and have only 100 calories per serving. Moreover, pears are sodium free, fat free and cholesterol free.  Uses  Since Bosc pears have a firm and solid flesh, they can be used in a variety of ways such as baking, broiling and poaching. They can maintain their form throughout the process making them a resilient fruit to use.

Fewer are found elsewhere, but include several African, some in North America, three from Australia and three from the Palearctic, notably the relatively well-known European R. linearis. These brown insects are primarily found in stagnant or slow-moving water like ponds, marshes and canals, but can also be seen in streams. Exceptionally they have been recorded from hypersaline lakes and brackish lagoons. Ranatra chinensis Ranatra crawling on human fingers Ranatra linearis Their front legs are strong and used to grasp prey. They typically eat other insects, tadpoles and small fish, which they pierce with their proboscis and inject a saliva which both sedates and begins to digest their prey. They are sit-and-wait predators that reside among water plants and position themselves head-down with their grasping legs extended out to surprise passing prey. At least one species will also swim in open water at night to catch zooplanktonic organisms. Like other members in the family they have a long tail-like siphon, or breathing tube, on the rear end of their body. The adult body length is generally depending on the exact species, and females average larger than males of the same species. The siphon is typically almost the same size, but varies from less than half the body length to somewhat longer. Two of the largest species are the East Asian R. chinensis and South American R. magna. Ranatra do have wings and they can fly. The adults are active year-round, except in extreme cold. Their eggs are positioned on plants just below the water surface, but in some species they can be placed in mud. The eggs typically take two to four weeks to hatch and the young take about two months to mature. Among the four genera in the Ranatrinae subfamily, Austronepa and Goondnomdanepa are restricted to Australia. Cercotmetus from Asia to New Guinea resembles Ranatra, although the former has a distinctly shorter siphon.

In 1995, the Texas Legislature passed a proposed constitutional amendment to abolish the office, which was approved by the voters later that same year. The office was formally dismantled in 1996. On her last day in office, August 31, 1996, she scraped her name and title off the glass front of the Treasurer's headquarters.

Price is probably best known for a 1972 result now known as Price's theorem. This is usually informally stated as follows: any inhomogeneities in the spacetime geometry outside a black hole will be radiated away. (Any such inhomogeneities can be quantified as nonzero higher multipole moments.) Price's theorem explains how the no hair theorem is enforced. Price also made pioneering numerical simulations which established (nonrigorously) a precise scenario for the emission of gravitational radiation during the merger of two compact objects (such as two black holes). Subsequent work has largely confirmed the scenario which was first developed in his work. These simulations have provided a major impetus for the development of gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. He has done much in development of pedagogical techniques in physics at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc levels; a significant portion at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. He creates beautiful atlases of relativity. Price is the coauthor of three well known books in general relativity.

Originally used by police and traffic wardens, their use has extended to other public officials and authorities, as has the range of offences for which they can be used. In recent years, this has taken the form of using them to give police and public authorities in England, Scotland and Wales a realistic weapon against anti-social behaviour. They are designed to reduce paperwork on police and council officers by allowing low- level anti-social behaviour to be dealt with on the spot. Newer types of notice exist for disorder, environmental crime, truancy and noise. A fixed penalty notice is not a fine or criminal conviction because of the distinction that the recipient can opt for the matter to be dealt with in court instead of paying. However, if the recipient neither pays the penalty nor opts for a court hearing in the time specified, it may then be enforced by the normal methods used to enforce unpaid fines, including imprisonment in some circumstances. Civil penalties such as a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) are a similar legal construct used for issuing on-the-spot fines. Unlike FPNs, civil penalties have an assumption of \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" with a burden being placed on the individual to appeal the fine. Civil penalties can be issued for property violations, tax code violations or illegal employment . The appeal processes tend to operate through tribunals. A Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) was defined in the Blairite Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, based on the success of the 1998 Anti-social behaviour order (ASBO).  History  FPNs were originally introduced for parking and motoring offences by part III of the Transport Act 1982 (replaced by the Road Traffic Act 1988); in many areas this style of enforcement has been taken over from police by local authorities. Examples = Penalty Charge Notices (parking and motoring offences) = Other than parking, motoring offences can also be dealt with by the issue of FPNs by police, officers of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency or local authority personnel. A penalty notice issued by local authority parking attendants is a civil penalty backed with powers to obtain payment by civil action and is defined as a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN), distinguishing it from other FPNs which are often backed with a power of criminal prosecution if the penalty is not paid; in the latter case the \\"fixed penalty\\" is sometimes designated as a \\"mitigated penalty\\" to indicate the avoidance of being prosecuted which it provides. If a PCN is paid within 14 days of the 28-day period, the charge is decreased by 50%. Appealing against or contesting a PCN requires going through a formal process: if lost, the 50% period pay could be extended. To appeal a PCN normally an informal appeal is made to the body that issued you the ticket, if not an appeal may be made to adjudicating bodies created according to the Traffic Management Act 2004, and finally this bodies decisions can be challenged by judicial review. If you decline the offer of immunity from prosecution by declining an FPN, you may have to attend court if a government body chooses to prosecute you for the incident covered by the FPN. Penalty Charge Notices (PCN) should not be confused with 'Parking Charge Notices, the latter, being issued by private landowners seeking to impose a charge for parking on private land. = Penalty Notices for Disorder = Issued under Section 1‚Äì11 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 for public disorder offences and divided into \\"lower-tier\\" and \\"higher-tier\\" offences each with its own penalty amount, a Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) can only be issued to people aged 18 or over. There are 26 offences for which a notice can be issued, such as being drunk and disorderly in a public place, selling alcohol to a minor (under 18), threatening behaviour or language and \\"behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to others\\". Penalty notices can also be issued for minor shop thefts and minor criminal damage and in January 2009 the offence of possession of cannabis was added to the scheme. Recipients have 21 days to pay the notice or request a court hearing. If a penalty notice is not paid after 21 days then the outstanding amount is increased by 50% and if it is still unpaid the fine is lodged at the local magistrates' court just as if the matter was an unpaid court fine. This is where PNDs and FPNs vary if they are not paid: the former results in an unpaid fine being lodged and the latter results in the recipient being summoned to court to answer for the original offence. When paying penalty notices for disorder, no admission of guilt is required. Paying the PND involves neither an official finding nor an acceptance of guilt and discharges all liability to conviction for the offence. PNDs for recordable offences are however recorded on the Police National Computer and may be disclosed on an Enhanced Criminal Records Disclosure issued by the Disclosure and Barring Service, if it is concluded that the behaviour leading to the PND was relevant to the matter at hand, for example, the applicant‚Äôs suitability to work with children. However, the mere fact that a PND has been issued would not make it relevant. PNDs are generally issued to first-time offenders with no previous record. PNDs do not constitute a criminal record; they are non- conviction information and treated as intelligence.  Experiments on Juvenile PND  In some areas there was a pilot scheme, documented in November 2008, that allowed a PND to be issued to 10- to 15-year-olds the parent or guardian was liable for the penalty. The tariff was reduced, ¬£40 for the higher-tier offences and ¬£30 for the lower-tier offences. The police forces that piloted Juvenile PNDs were: * British Transport Police (Birmingham Division) * Essex * Lancashire * Merseyside * Metropolitan Police (Kingston Division) * Nottinghamshire * West Midlands = FPN for environmental crime = Fixed penalty notices are available as a means for dealing with various environmental crimes. The first was introduced in 1990 for leaving litter, and since then numerous others have followed, particularly as a result of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, and the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. The majority of these are issued by local authority officers, but police and Environment Agency officers have been authorised to issue some. The penalty ranges from ¬£20 for unnecessary idling of a stationary vehicle engine to ¬£500 for failing to comply with a noise warning notice in licensed premises. By far the majority of fixed penalty notices issued for environmental crimes are for leaving litter, failing to remove dog faeces, and fly posting. The Government has determined that fly tipping is too serious to warrant a fixed penalty, and that cases should be referred to a magistrates' court. Minor criminal damage such as graffiti may also be dealt with by issuing a fixed penalty notice. = FPN for truancy = Section 23 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 allows local authorities, head teachers (or their deputies) and the police to issue a ¬£50 or ¬£100 FPN to a parent or parents who fail to ensure that their child regularly attends school. The Education and Inspections Act 2006 came into force on 4 September 2007. Under this, parents of children excluded from school are required to keep them under supervision for the first five days of their exclusion. If the child is found in a public place without their parent during this time, the parent can be issued a ¬£50 penalty notice, which rises to ¬£100 if not paid in 28 days. = FPN for night noise = Section 2 of the Noise Act 1996 allows local authorities to investigate complaints from residents about excessive noise coming from a residential dwelling during the night, defined as between the hours of 11pm and 7am. =FPNs for breaches of Covid19 restrictions= Regulations issued in 2020 introduced FPNs with fines ranging from ¬£30 to ¬£10,000 for various violations of restrictions brought in to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, including via the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (England) Regulations 2020, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Wearing of Face Coverings on Public Transport) (England) Regulations 2020, and the COVID-19 local lockdown regulations in England. On 28 August 2020, The Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions on Holding of Gatherings and Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 SI 907/2020 increased the FPN to \\"must be ¬£10,000\\" in case an assembly of \\"more than thirty persons\\". The next day, Piers Corbyn was handed a ¬£10,000 FPN for organising an assembly in Trafalgar Square of thousands of people skeptical of the government policy on COVID.  Challenges to the enforceability of PCNs  The Bill of Rights 1689 creates legislation stating \\"all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before conviction are illegal and void\\". Since PCNs create fines before conviction, there have been attempts to challenge PCN legislation using the Bill of Rights 1689. Robin de Crittenden sought a judicial review on these grounds in 2006. His request for judicial review was declined by Mr Justice Collins on the grounds that PCNs are \\"not a fine or forfeiture within the meaning of the Bill of Rights\\" because what the Bill of Rights prevents is \\"a fine or a forfeiture in respect of which there is no right of appeal, whether ultimately to a court or through a system which is set up which is equivalent to a court.\\" While maintaining that PCNs are compatible with the Bill of Rights, Collins commented that the clarity of legislation should be used as a factor when determining if new legislation is compatible with preexisting legislation: \\"If it passes an Act which clearly states something which could arguably be said to be contrary to a previous Act, then if it is clear and if there is no argument that can be raised against its clear meaning, it will prevail.\\" Case law created at a later date touches on the ability to impliedly repeal parts of the Bill of Rights. In Thoburn v Sunderland City Council, Lord Justice Laws, ruled that constitutional statutes could not be impliedly repealed (\\"Ordinary statutes may be impliedly repealed. Constitutional statutes may not. For the repeal of a constitutional Act or the abrogation of a fundamental right to be effected by statute, the court would apply this test: is it shown that the legislature's actual ‚Äì not imputed, constructive or presumed ‚Äì intention was to effect the repeal or abrogation?\\") stating that \\"the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Union, the Reform Acts [...], the HRA, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 1998\\" are examples of constitutional statutes. The implications of the ruling of Thoburn v Sunderland City Council to the enforcement of civil penalties were, to some degree, tested in the First-tier Tribunal case Pendle v HMRC , though since First-tier Tribunal rulings are non-binding this decision would only be taken as advisory in any other court.

In May 995, he was captured by a raiding party while out hunting. Wounded in the encounter, he was sent to Cordoba as a trophy, but died at Medinaceli in June 995.  Family  The son of Count Fern√°n Gonz√°lez and Queen Sancha S√°nchez of Pamplona, in 970 he succeeded his father as Count of Castile. He continued to recognise the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, even though he was practically autonomous. In order to expand his frontiers at the expense of the Moors, in 974 he expanded the social base of the nobility by promulgating decrees stating that any villein of Castrojeriz who equipped a knight for battle would enter the ranks of the nobility. He was succeeded by his son, Sancho I of Castile. Marriage and issue Around 960, Garcia married Ava de Ribagorza, daughter of Raymond II, count of Ribagorza. They had seven children: *Mayor Garc√≠a, married to Raymond III, count of Pallars Juss√†. Repudiated by her husband, she returned to Castile where she was the abbess of the Monastery of San Miguel de Pedroso. With the help of her brother Sancho, she governed the County of Ribagorza which would eventually pass to her niece, Muniadona of Castile, the wife of King Sancho III of Pamplona. * Sancho Garc√≠a, count of Castile. * Urraca Garc√≠a, the first abbess of the Colegiata de San Cosme y San Dami√°n in Covarrubias. * Gonzalo Garc√≠a (died 979), speculated to have been ancestor of the Salvad√≥rez and the House of Lara * Elvira Garc√≠a, married in 991 to Bermudo II of Le√≥n * Toda Garc√≠a, married Sancho G√≥mez, son of Count G√≥mez D√≠az of Salda√±a * Oneca Garc√≠a, the first abbess of the Monastery of San Juan in Cillaperlata and later abess at the Monastery of Monastery of San Salvador de O√±a.  In legend  Garc√≠a plays a role in two legends regarding medieval Castile. These are set during his rule and incorporate aspects of authentic history, but are mostly fictional in nature. In the Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara, Count Garc√≠a plays a minor role, trying unsuccessfully to impose a rapprochement between the two antagonistic families, those of Ruy Vel√°zquez and his wife Do√±a Lambra, said to be a cousin of Garc√≠a, and Gonzalo Gustoz and his wife Sancha. This proves unsuccessful when a further provocation leads to cycles of escalating retribution. His role in a second legend is more substantial. La condesa traidora (The treasonous countess), tells of the wife of Garc√≠a was enticed by Almanzor, ruler of C√≥rdoba, to aspire to become his wife rather than that of a less powerful count. She plots up her husband's death, by providing his horse poor feed. When the animal collapses in battle, Garc√≠a is severely injured, and dies days later. After Almanzor forces her son, count Sancho Garc√≠a, to flee to Lantar√≥n, his mother plots his death as well. She has a poisoned draught prepared-for him, but Sancho is forewarned and insists that his mother drink it instead. She does so and dies, and Sancho then defeats Almanzor in battle.

She first appeared in X-Men #17 (February 1993) and was created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Andy Kubert. The character is most commonly associated with the X-Men, specifically the character of Psylocke, with whom she switched bodies. She is a mutant with low-level empathy. In Psylocke's body, she had access to telepathic abilities and used it primarily to generate a psionic sword. She was a member of The Hand. In the pages of 2019's, Hunt For Wolverine: Mystery In Madripoor limited series, she is resurrected and returned to her original body. She also starred as the main character of the second Fallen Angels series, as the second Psylocke (the original, Betsy Braddock, having become the newest Captain Britain). Publication history Revanche first appeared in X-Men #17 (February 1993), created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Andy Kubert. She appeared in X-Men comics of this era until her death in X-Men #31. Much of the early narrative surrounding the character of Revanche/Kwannon was confused by continuity errors created by Fabian Nicieza, who had failed to read Uncanny X-Men #255, which depicts the character of Psylocke being discovered on the shores of an island by ninjas of The Hand. Revanche's origin described in X-Men Vol 2 #22 directly contradicted this scene, so subsequent comics introduced a convoluted series of events to explain away this and other inconsistencies. Her body - or rather the original body of the X-Man Psylocke, which she had come to possess - is later briefly resurrected by The Sisterhood in Uncanny X-Men #509, but Revanche herself does not appear. Kwannon is later resurrected permanently and returned to her original body in the final pages of the limited series Hunt For Wolverine: Mystery In Madripoor #4, and she resurfaces in the 2019 series Uncanny X-Men #16. Kwannon will take on the mantle of Psylocke, as part of the new Fallen Angels team alongside Cable and X-23. The relaunch will be written by Bryan Edward Hill and penciled by Szymon Kudranski. Fictional character biography The Japanese woman known as Kwannon was first seen as the prime assassin of the Japanese crimelord Nyoirin and lover of The Hand assassin Matsu'o Tsurayaba. With the criminal interests of Nyoirin and The Hand quickly coming into conflict, Kwannon elicits a promise from Matsu'o that they will fight to the death rather than betray their respective lords. During a duel at the estate of Nyoirin, Kwannon eventually falls from a cliff; with her physical injuries and lack of oxygen while underwater causing her to become brain-damaged and comatose. Nyoirin, who possesses an unrequited love for Kwannon, bids that Matsu'o take her to The Hand to be healed, with the promise that he will not cross their organisation again.X-Men Vol 2 #22.

In a flashback scene from the same time period, Matsu'o and Nyoirin discuss placing Kwannon's mind in Psylocke's body, adding that the transfer will require the use of the Mandarin's rings. It is revealed that Kwannon's low-level empathy is the only thing that will allow her mind to withstand direct contact with the mind of a powerful psychic such as Psylocke.X-Men Vol 2 #32 At the same time Matsu'o strikes a deal with the extra-dimensional sorceress Spiral, a begrudging servant of Mojo, to ensure Kwannon's physical body is healed enough to survive the stresses of the procedure. As Mojo and Spiral have a marked interest in Psylocke - and the continued transmission of the feed from the bionic eyes they implanted in her body some time ago - Spiral also uses her magic and the alien technology of her Body Shoppe to intermingle the DNA of the two women. The two bodies now share genetic traits and mutations such as purple hair and eyes, both possessing true telepathic abilities, and have a physical resemblance to each other despite their different races. This resemblance is strong enough that Wolverine is able to recognise Psylocke's face upon seeing her for the first time in Kwannon's body, and later notes that both bodies share a similar smell. Both women are also now able to create psychic weapons - Psylocke a blade of focused telepathic energy from the back of her right hand, and Kwannon a psychic katana construct. Due to the extreme damage to Kwannon's mind - and possible further intervention from Spiral, who at one point claims responsibilityX-Men Vol 2 #32. Marvel Comics. - the switching of minds between the two women is only partially successful. Psylocke in Kwannon's body retains all of her memories, but gains the martial arts and other expertise of Kwannon, as well as some of her preferences and personality traits (she shows a liking for Asian themed clothing and decorations,X-Men Vol 2 #24. Marvel Comics. is generally more aggressive and pursues a flirtation with Cyclops). While Kwannon awakens an amnesiac invalid - essentially a blank slate - but now speaks with a British accent, even while speaking Japanese, and can also read in this language. Psylocke briefly operates as The Mandarin's assassin before breaking free and rejoining the X-Men.Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 #258. Marvel Comics. Meanwhile, Spiral meets with Nyoirin, heavily implying that Psylocke's former body now contains the remnants of Kwannon's mind. Seizing this opportunity, Nyoirin takes this body back to his estate, nursing Kwannon back to physical health, while at the same time retraining her and feeding her lies regarding her history and identity.X-Men Vol 2 #31-32. Marvel Comics. To prove her readiness to confront the X-Men and her 'other self', Kwannon, in a partial duplicate of Psylocke's former armor, defeats a gang of street thugs on the streets of Tokyo and then later slaughters ninja at Nyoirin's estate. During this time Nyoirin specifically refers to her as Kwannon, while Kwannon states her goal is to \\"regain her rightful place as (Nyoirin's) elite assassin\\" - making it clear both are aware of her true identity. At Nyoirin's behest Kwannon travels to America, infiltrating the X-Mansion and showing enough skill with her telepathy to mask her mind from Jean Grey, Charles Xavier and Psylocke. She confronts Psylocke in the Danger Room while wearing a facsimile of her former armor, and is shown manifesting her psychic katana on panel for the first time; using the weapon to incapacitate her.X-Men Vol 2 #20. Marvel Comics. Confronted by Charles Xavier and multiple X-Men, Kwannon states that she is the real Betsy Braddock, and that Psylocke is an imposter sent by Nyoirin to assassinate them all.X-Men Vol 2 #21. Marvel Comics. As Kwannon is in Psylocke's former body, their scents are the same and even the mansion computer registers their energy signatures as duplicates, there is considerable doubt as to the veracity of Psylocke's identity. Even Charles Xavier and Jean Grey are unable to immediately telepathically discern the truth, with both women sharing surface psi- signatures. This is exacerbated when Psylocke refuses a deeper telepathic scan as she does not want her mind violated, while Kwannon willingly offers to submit - something Psylocke notes is \\"masterfully played\\". Kwannon also displays intimate knowledge of the X-Men, recognising those present, and correctly identifying that she has never previously met Professor Xavier (whether this is due to careful research on Kwannon and Nyoirin's behalf, or memories she gained from Psylocke is never made clear). Psylocke and Kwannon preferred to settle the question of their identities through combat. However Charles Xavier and Wolverine note anomalies in Kwannon's story - her scent is different to that of Psylocke's from before she went through the Siege, and she is now proficient in Ninjitsu - it's therefore decided that Kwannon, now calling herself Revanche, Psylocke, Gambit and Beast will travel to Japan to search for answers. A rationale for Revanche's choice of new codename is never stated on panel, though it presumably refers to her stated intent of reclaiming her life from Psylocke. Revanche also debuts a new costume, which incorporates colours and elements from Psylocke's former armor.X-Men Vol 2 #21 & 22. Marvel Comics. Infiltrating Nyoirin's estate, Kwannon demonstrates intimate knowledge of the buildings and defenses, claiming this is due to being held prisoner there for months. She leads the X-Men to Nyoirin's study, which contains a large portrait of Psylocke in Kwannon's body, titled \\"Kwannon In Repose\\" - Revanche states this is proof of Psylocke's treachery, however the portrait features purple hair, which Kwannon's body only gained after the mind swap, so it is clearly part of a larger deception by Revanche and Nyoirin. The quartet are ambushed by Silver Samurai, who is easily dispatched by Psylocke and Revanche, with the two demonstrating mirrored fighting styles and instinctively coordinated attacks, as they did while fighting ninja earlier. The battle with Silver Samurai reveals a hidden scroll written by Nyoirin, which Revanche is able to read despite it being written in Japanese. She then stabs Psylocke with her psychic katana, preventing her from leaving while she reads a story from the scroll (and seems to project the images from this story into Psylocke's mind) that seems to explain what happened to the two: while on assignment, Kwannon found Psylocke who had just emerged from the Siege Perilous, her body and mind fractured. When the two touched their minds fused, with a confused Psylocke running off and becoming brain-washed by Matsu'o and The Mandarin, while Revanche ended up in a sanitarium, and was eventually found by Nyoirin. A key factor demonstrating the falseness of this story is that Psylocke is showing emerging from the Siege fully clothed in her armor, while anyone truly emerging from the Siege Perilous does so naked. The four are then confronted by Nyoirin. After a standoff, he insists that the two women have merged minds and identities, and sends them after Matsu'o. Of note the narration in issue #22 states that Revanche is seeking answers about her identity, which contradicts previous issues where she is clearly a willing participant in Nyoirin's deception. Psylocke and Revanche then confront Matsu'o in his home, grievously wounding him and further demonstrating their coordinated fighting style. Matsu'o also insists that the two women have combined identities, with he and Nyoirin each having deliberately moulded them into assassins.X-Men Vol 2 #23. Marvel Comics. Upon returning from Japan Psylocke and Revanche spar, trying to come to an understanding about their current state of being. It's stated that even though they move and function in concert, they are unable to read each other's minds. A conversation at the end of the issue further implies that Revanche is not who she says she is. Revanche is accepted by the X-Men, and is present during a meeting regarding Magneto's attack on the Earth, Thanksgiving celebrations, and accompanies a team of X-Men to Genosha while Psylocke is left behind.X-Men Vol 2 #25-26. Marvel Comics. Seeking answers, Psylocke finally agrees to let Jean Grey probe her mind, with Jean finding that the two women have been fused on a fundamental level. While on a mission with the X-Men's Blue team Revanche reveals she is suffering from the Legacy Virus, a lethal infection that is fatal to mutants. Her reaction to her illness and subsequent behaviour further call the truth of her claims into question, while Psylocke alternately displays concern and antagonism toward her.X-Men Vol 2 Annual #02. Marvel Comics.X-Men Vol 2 #27-28. Marvel Comics. With her death approaching Revanche departs the X-Mansion in the middle of the night, leaving behind the bionic eyes that had been implanted in her body and a note confessing her duplicity in attempting to assume Psylocke's identity. At the same time Spiral visits Matsu'o, confessing her part in merging the two women. Journeying to Japan Revanche confronts Matsu'o for his part in her ordeal, stating that the Legacy Virus is increasing her telepathic powers as it builds to her death; allowing her to cut through the fog of her memory, and the lies told by Nyoirin, to the truth. Even as she painfully probes Matsu'o's mind he still refuses to see Revanche as she currently is, picturing her as Psylocke instead. He also continues to insist that he had no knowledge of the two women switching bodies until after the fact, suggesting an extreme level of denial as to his part in the body swap. However, he does confess that once he did realise he tried to mould Psylocke into a facsimile of Revanche, hoping that having her body would be enough; while Revanche confesses that what she believed to be her previous memories were actually based on lies and a fictitious diary created by Nyoirin specifically to keep her away from Matsu'o. This explains why she failed to recognise Matsu'o during their previous encounter, while Matsu'o states he pretended not to know her as part of some penance for the wrongs he had visited upon her. With the moment of her death imminent Revanche begs Matsu'o to kill her, which he does. Her death is felt telepathically by Psylocke and Archangel, while the final truth and some of the telepathic energy she wielded is imprinted onto Matsu'o. Psylocke is visited by Spiral, who confesses her part in proceedings and hints she should use the bionic eyes to show her the truth. Psylocke watches a playback from the time of her transformation, recorded by the eyes, which answers many questions regarding Matsu'o, Nyoirin, The Mandarin and Spiral's involvement. She also realises that Revanche was unconsciously using her telepathic powers to create anger and confusion in the minds around her, explaining the aggressive reactions of some of the X-Men; and likely explaining away plot holes like why Psylocke or Revanche didn't simply read Nyoirin or Matsu'o's minds when they confronted them. This information leads her back to Japan, where she finds Matsu'o, who has killed Nyoirin for his part in things. Matsu'o presents her with the final truth regarding the body swap, confirming that Revanche was never comfortable with the telepathic abilities she gained and projected that anger and discomfort into the minds around her; and that ultimately she came to respect Psylocke and the X-Men. He is then able to use the final burst of Revanche's telepathic energy to take away all of Kwannon's memories from Psylocke (thought she retains her martial arts skills and abilities). Psylocke and Matsu'o then bury Kwannon, putting their history behind them and departing peacefully. Much later the Sisterhood of Mutants stole this body from a grave in Tokyo (it seems Kwannon's final body was moved by Matsu'o, as this is not the original location of her grave) and performed a ritual using a captured Psylocke, which forcibly restored Betsy to her original body and under the control of the Red Queen.Uncanny X-Men #508 In a final confrontation, Betsy faced off against Dazzler, attacking her with her psionic blade. Alison defended herself, channeling the ambient noise of San Francisco into an intense laser beam, burning off half of Betsy's face and allowing her to regain control. Betsy drove her blade into her own head and confronted the darker counterpart controlling her body on the astral plane. Betsy eventually won, and her psyche returned to Kwannon's body, leaving her original body a corpse yet again.Uncanny X-Men #511 In the aftermath, Psylocke identifies the body as genuine and travels to Japan, intending to re-inter Kwannon, but during an attack by agents of the Hand her original body is destroyed, at the behest of Matsu'o.Psylocke #1 Psylocke eventually realises this is an attempt by Matsu'o to goad her into performing a mercy killing on him. Psylocke eventually agrees, and projects an illusion of herself as Kwannon to comfort him in his final moments.Psylocke #4 =Resurrection in Original Body= During the \\"Hunt for Wolverine\\" storyline, Psylocke's soul is absorbed by Sapphire Styx, leaving her body dead. As Psylocke's soul escapes, Styx's body explodes and she instinctively reforms a new body, identical to her original British body, from Styx's soul power. Later, Kwannon is revealed to be returned to life in her original body, now vacated by Psylocke. She ambushes a henchman in Viper's penthouse, stating in Japanese that she has some questions and manifesting one of Psylocke's psychic knives. Kwannon reappeared in East Transia when the X-Men took on a new version Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Finding out that this Magneto was actually the clone Joseph, Kwannon killed him with her sword, then told the X-Men while speaking in Japanese that she was trying to remember them and that she was nothing as translated by Wolverine. She said she killed Joseph because he was a weapon to be used to erase mutants from the world if not stopped. Abilities Previous to the exchanging bodies with Psylocke, Kwannon was said to be an intuitive empath. The extent and origin of these abilities is unknown.All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update vol. 1 #4 Upon inhabiting Psylocke's body she gained telepathic abilities and the power to generate a katana and other bladed weapon constructs composed of psionic energy. These blades were capable of disrupting a person's neural functions on contact, generally rendering them unconscious. The appearance of the katana varied; on at least one occasion Revanche was shown to generate a small psychic dagger instead of a full blade.X-Men #23 Using her psi-blade, Revanche could force her way into another telepath's mind.X-Men #22 Though her new body had originally possessed a wide range of telepathic abilities, Revanche very rarely utilized them. In combat she relied almost solely on her martial arts skill and psychic katana. However, she was shown to possess enough skill and power to successfully shield her mind from Jean Grey's telepathic scans and sneak into the X-Mansion undetected.X-Men #20 It was later explained that because of the discomfort of using her newfound telepathy, Revanche unconsciously projected her frustration and confusion onto the X-Men whenever she was around them, causing them to be more agitated and aggressive in return, and to believe the same lies she herself had been told by Nyoirin.X-Men #32 This manipulation was so subtle that none of the X-Men's other telepaths were able to detect it. Once infected with the Legacy Virus, Revanche's telepathic powers increased to the point where she was able to cut through the fog of her own clouded memories and recall the truth of her origins. She was also shown to read minds and project her own thoughts, even across continents, and to psionically mask her mind from Professor Xavier's own telepathic abilities, even while standing right beside him.X-Men #31 Shortly before her death, Revanche displayed a butterfly-like psychic energy aura whenever using her powers, as Psylocke did in both her original and Japanese bodies. Revanche was also somehow able to temporarily imprint Matsu'o Tsurayaba with telepathic energy that freed Psylocke of the portions of Revanche's mind she had absorbed. After resurrection in her original body, Kwannon has displayed telepathic abilities and the capacity to generate 'knives' of psychic energy from the back of her hands. She is now skilled enough with her telepathy to read and tracks minds and project her thoughts - even employing the ability to read and anticipate the movements of an opponent during a bladed duel. Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Kwannon appears in Ultimate X-Men, beginning in issue 32. S.T.R.I.K.E. Psi-Division agent Elisabeth Braddock is killed by Colossus in order to destroy Proteus, who has taken her as his host.Ultimate X-Men #17 She later appears at the gala celebration held at the X-Mansion, this time in the body of a Japanese teenager. She explains that after she died, her consciousness migrated to the body of a comatose Japanese girl named Kwannon, who was \\"happy to go the light\\". Despite the disdainful reactions of her listeners, Betsy herself does not mind the change, stating she's \\"never felt perkier\\". This version of Kwannon was considerably younger than Betsy Braddock; upon inhabiting Kwannon's body Betsy was too young to be a S.T.R.I.K.E. agent, but was working undercover for Professor Xavier. She eventually became a member of the most recent lineup of X-Men.Ultimate X-Men #32 =House of M= Kwannon, in Psylocke's original body post bodyswap, was seen in the House of M altered reality as a member of Magneto's elite guards, as depicted in House of M #7. She was returned to her grave after the House of M was undone. In other media The character had a non speaking cameo appearance in the mid-1990s X-Men animated television series. Redistributed in X-Men: Volume 4 (Marvel DVD Collection). She can be seen in the multi-part storyline \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" (Part 4) as one of Apocalypse's captive psychics.

Rebounds in basketball are a routine part in the game; most possessions change after a shot is successfully made, or the rebound allows the defensive team to take possession. Rebounds are also given to a player who tips in a missed shot on his team's offensive end. A rebound can be grabbed by either an offensive player or a defensive player. Rebounds are divided into two main categories: \\"offensive rebounds\\", in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and \\"defensive rebounds\\", in which the defending team gains possession. The majority of rebounds are defensive because the team on defense tends to be in better position (i.e., closer to the basket) to recover missed shots. Offensive rebounds give the offensive team another opportunity to score whether right away or by resetting the offense. A block is not considered a rebound.A ball does not need to actually \\"rebound\\" off the rim or backboard for a rebound to be credited. Rebounds are credited after any missed shot, including air balls. If a player takes a shot and misses and the ball bounces on the ground before someone picks it up, then the person who picks up the ball is credited for a rebound. Rebounds are credited to the first player that gains clear possession of the ball or to the player that successfully deflects the ball into the basket for a score. A rebound is credited to a team when it gains possession of the ball after any missed shot that is not cleared by a single player (e.g., deflected out of bounds after the shot, blocked out of bounds, bounced directly off the rim out of bounds). A team rebound is never credited to any player, and is generally considered to be a formality as according to the rules of basketball, every missed shot must be rebounded whether a single player controls the ball or not. Josh Jackson and Jarrett Allen (#31) crash the offensive boards at the 2016 McDonald's All-American Boys Game. Great rebounders tend to be tall and strong. Because height is so important, most rebounds are made by centers and power forwards, who are often positioned closer to the basket. The lack of height can sometimes be compensated by the strength to box out taller players away from the ball to capture the rebound. For example, Charles Barkley once led the league in rebounding despite usually being much shorter than his counterparts. Some shorter guards can be excellent rebounders as well such as point guard Jason Kidd who led the New Jersey Nets in rebounding for several years. Great rebounders must also have a keen sense of timing and positioning. Great leaping ability is an important asset, but not absolutely necessary. Players such as Larry Bird and Moses Malone were excellent rebounders, but were never known for their leaping ability. Bird has stated, \\"Most rebounds are taken below the rim. That's where I get mine\\").CNN/SI - 33: Larry Bird enters the Hall of Fame  Boxing out  Paul White (#13) and L. J. Peak (#10) box out D. J. Williams (#4) While Jahlil Okafor boxes out Jabari Parker on a Kendrick Nunn free throw during a Chicago Public High School League game between Simeon Career Academy and Whitney M. Young Magnet High School at the Jones Convocation Center Players position themselves in the best spot to get the rebound by \\"boxing out\\"‚Äîi.e., by positioning themselves between an opponent and the basket, and maintaining body contact with the player he is guarding. The action can also be called \\"blocking out\\". A team can be boxed out by several players using this technique to stop the other team from rebounding. Because fighting for a rebound can be very physical, rebounding is often regarded as \\"grunt work\\" or a \\"hustle\\" play. Overly aggressive boxing out or preventing being boxed out can lead to personal fouls. Statistics Statistics of a player's \\"rebounds per game\\" or \\"rebounding average\\" measure a player's rebounding effectiveness by dividing the number of rebounds by the number of games played. Rebound rates go beyond raw rebound totals by taking into account external factors, such as the number of shots taken in games and the percentage of those shots that are made (the total number of rebounds available). Rebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1950‚Äì51 season. Both offensive and defensive rebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973‚Äì74 season and ABA during the 1967‚Äì68 season. New camera technology has been able to shed much more light on where missed shots will likely land.  Notable rebounders in the NBA  Wilt Chamberlain in 1960, when he averaged 27 rebounds per game. * Wilt Chamberlain ‚Äì led the NBA in rebounds in 11 different seasons, has the most career rebounds in the regular season (23,924), the highest career average (22.9 rpg), the single season rebounding records in total (2,149) and average (27.2 rpg), most rebounds in a regular season game (55) and playoff game (41) in the NBA, and has the most career All-Star Game rebounds (197). *Bill Russell ‚Äì first player to average over 20 rebounds per game in the regular season, ranks second to Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average (22.5) rebounds, averaged more than 20 rebounds per game in 10 of 13 seasons played, grabbed 51 rebounds in a single game (second best ever), grabbed a record 32 rebounds in one half, grabbed 40 rebounds in the NBA Finals twice, and is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9 rpg) rebounds. *Bob Pettit ‚Äì averaged 20.3 rebounds per game in the 1960‚Äì61 season, his career average of 16.2 rebounds per game is third all-time, and holds the top two performances for rebounds in an NBA All-Star Game with 26 (in 1958) and 27 (in 1962). *Nate Thurmond ‚Äì averaged more than 20 rebounds per game in two seasons (including 22.0 rpg in the 1967‚Äì68 season), career average of 15.0 rpg, and holds the regular season NBA record for rebounds in a single quarter with 18. He is also the only player besides Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry Lucas to record more than 40 rebounds in a single game. *Jerry Lucas ‚Äì averaged more than 20 rebounds per game in two seasons (including 21.1 rpg in the 1965‚Äì66 season), and had a career average of 15.6 rpg. Along with Russell, Chamberlain and Thurmond is one of only four players to grab at least 40 rebounds in a single game. *Moses Malone ‚Äì led the NBA in rebounds per game in six different seasons including a high of 17.6 rpg in the 1978‚Äì79 season, ranks first in career offensive rebounds in the regular season (offensive and defensive rebounds were not recorded separately until the 1973‚Äì74 season), and ranks fifth all-time in total regular season rebounds in the NBA (third if ABA rebounds are also included). *Dennis Rodman ‚Äì led the league in rebounds per game an NBA record 7 consecutive seasons, including a high of 18.7 rpg in the 1991‚Äì92 season. Rodman holds the top seven rebound rate seasons since the 1970‚Äì71 season. Rodman has the highest career rebounding average of any player since the NBA began recording offensive and defensive rebounds in . *Dwight Howard ‚Äì only player to lead the NBA in rebounding three times before turning 25 years old. Howard has led the league in rebounding five times. *Andre Drummond ‚Äî has led the NBA in rebounds per game in four different seasons. Drummond has the highest career rebounds per game average of any player to play in the 21st century.

The theorem was published in 1858 by Rev. Hamnet Holditch.Holditch, Rev. Hamnet, \\"Geometrical theorem\\", The Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 2, 1858, p. 38. While not mentioned by Holditch, the proof of the theorem requires an assumption that the chord be short enough that the traced locus is a simple closed curve.Broman, Arne, \\"A fresh look at a long-forgotten theorem\\", Mathematics Magazine 54(3), May 1981, 99‚Äì108. Observations The theorem is included as one of Clifford Pickover's 250 milestones in the history of mathematics. Some peculiarities of the theorem include that the area formula pi pq is independent of both the shape and the size of the original curve, and that the area formula is the same as for that of the area of an ellipse with semi-axes p and q. The theorem's author was a president of Caius College, Cambridge. Extensions Broman gives a more precise statement of the theorem, along with a generalization. The generalization allows, for example, consideration of the case in which the outer curve is a triangle, so that the conditions of the precise statement of Holditch's theorem do not hold because the paths of the endpoints of the chord have retrograde portions (portions that retrace themselves) whenever an acute angle is traversed. Nevertheless, the generalization shows that if the chord is shorter than any of the triangle's altitudes, and is short enough that the traced locus is a simple curve, Holditch's formula for the in-between area is still correct (and remains so if the triangle is replaced by any convex polygon with a short enough chord). However, other cases result in different formulas. References Sources * B.

Victoria Barracks is located in the suburb of Paddington, between Oxford Street and Moore Park Road. It is just north of the Moore Park, the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium. Victoria Barracks houses the Headquarters Forces Command. Listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List in 2004, the site contains one of the most important groups of Edwardian military buildings in Australia. The Army Museum of NSW is housed in the original District Military Prison, constructed in 1847. It is open to visitors on Thursday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and the first Sunday each month (by appointment) from 10:00 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. The museum is closed during December and January. Tours of the Barracks precinct are conducted by the Corps of Guides on Thursdays starting at 10:00 a.m. The Australian Army Band Sydney is located at Victoria Barracks. History The Regency style main barracks building was constructed of Hawkesbury sandstone by convicts between 1841 and 1846. The first building completed was the Officers' Quarters which was completed in 1842. The Main Barrack Block was completed in 1846 and was designed to accommodate 650 soldiers. The bell and clock were added to the building in 1856. The barracks were originally occupied by regiments of the British Army. The British troops vacated the barracks in 1870. The barracks was the premier military training site in Australia for many years, from its completion until after Federation in 1901. The bungalow was built in 1847 as the Barrack Master's Residence. The Garrison Hospital was built in 1845 to accommodate 36 patients. During the 1930s it was converted into an Officers' Mess. The gate on Oxford Street is referred to as the Queen Victoria Gate, while the gate on Moore Park road is known as the Convict Gate. Busby's Bore, was Sydney's second water supply, built by convicts between 1827 and 1837. An access shaft is located at the museum. For a brief period during the 1930s Victoria Barracks was home to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, when the College was forced to close its buildings in Canberra and relocate to Sydney due to the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression.

Barkatullah was born on 7 July 1854 at Itwra Mohalla Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, India. He fought from outside India, with fiery speeches and revolutionary writings in leading newspapers, for the independence of India. He did not live to see India independent. In 1988, Bhopal University was renamed Barkatullah UniversityBarkatullah University, BHOPAL at www.bubhopal.nic.in in his honour. He was also Prime Minister of first Provisional Government of India established at Afghanistan in 1915. Early life Policy of revolution While in England he came in close contact with Lala Hardayal and Raja Mahendra Pratap, son of the Raja of Hathras. He became a friend of Afghan Emir and the editor of the Kabul newspaper Sirejul-ul-Akber'. He was one of the founders of the Ghadar Party in 1913 at San Francisco. Later he became the first prime minister of the Provisional Government of India established on 1 December 1915 in Kabul with Raja Mahendra Pratap as its president. Barkatullah went to several countries of the world with a mission to rouse politically the Indian community and to seek support for the freedom of India from the famous leaders of the time in those countries. Prominent amongst those were Kaiser Wilhelm II, Amir Habibullah Khan, Mohammed Resched, Ghazi Pasha, Lenin, and Hitler. In England, in 1897, Barakatullah was seen attending meetings of the Muslim Patriotic League. Here, he came across other revolutionary compatriots around Shyamji Krishnavarma. After about a year spent in America, in February 1904 he left for Japan, where he was appointed Professor of Hindustani at the University of Tokyo. In the autumn of 1906, at 1 West 34th Street in New York City, a Pan- Aryan Association was formed by Barakatullah and Samuel Lucas Joshi, a Maratha Christian, son of the late Reverend Lucas Maloba Joshi; it was supported by the Irish revolutionaries of the Clan-na-Gael, the anti-British lawyer Myron H. Phelps and of the equally anti-British Swami Abhedananda who continued the work of Swami Vivekananda. According to a report in the Gaelic American, in June 1907, a meeting of Indians, held in New York, passed resolutions ‚Äúrepudiating the right of any foreigner (Mr. Morley) to dictate the future of the Indian people, urging their countrymen to depend upon themselves alone and especially on boycott and swadeshi, condemning the deportation of Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh, and expressing detestation of the action of the British authorities in openly instigating one class of Indians against another at Jamalpur and other places.\\" (Source: Ker, p225). More vehement was his letter in Persian, which appeared in the Urdu Mualla of Aligarh, U.P., in May 1907, in which Barakatullah strongly advocated the necessity for unity between Hindus and Muslims, and defined the two chief duties of Muslims as patriotism and friendship with all Muslims outside India. This prophetic argument preceded by four years the publication of Germany and the Coming War, by Bernhardi, warning England to be aware of the extreme danger represented by the unity of Hindu and Muslim extremists in Bengal, as reported by the Rowlatt Commission (Chapter VII). He thought that the performance of both these duties depended entirely upon one rule of conduct, namely concord and unity with the Hindus of India in all political matters. (Ker, p226). On 16 August 1908 arrived from Kolkata Bhupendra Nath Datta, Vivekananda‚Äôs hot-blooded brother. Invited by George Freeman to edit the Free Hindustan from the Gaelic American newspaper office, Taraknath Das went to New York to join his old colleague Datta. In March 1909 Barakatullah left again for Japan. Activities in Japan Early in 1910, he started the Islamic Fraternity in Tokyo. In June‚ÄìJuly 1911 he left for Constantinople and Petrograd, returned to Tokyo in October and published an article referring to the advent of a great pan- Islamic Alliance including Afghanistan which he expected to become \\"the future Japan of Central Asia\\". In December he converted to Islam three Japanese: his assistant Hassan U. Hatanao, his wife, and her father, Baron Kentaro Hiki. This is said to be the first conversion to Islam in Japan. In 1912, Barakatullah ‚Äúbecame at once more fluent in his use of the English language and more anti-British in his tone,‚Äù observes Ker (p133). Discussing in his paper the ‚ÄúChristian Combination against Islam,‚Äù Barakatullah singled out the Emperor William of Germany as really the one man ‚Äúwho holds the peace of the world as well as the war in the hollow of his hand : it is the duty of the Muslims to be united, to stand by the Khalif; with their life and property, and to side with Germany.‚Äù Quoting a Roman poet, Barakatullah reminded that the Anglo-Saxons had been sea-wolves, living on the pillage of the world. The difference in modern times was the added ‚Äúrefinement of hypocrisy which sharpens the edge of brutality.‚Äù On 6 July 1912, the entry of the paper into India was prohibited, before the Japanese Government suppressed it. Meanwhile, since September, copies of another paper called El Islam appeared in India, continuing Barakatullah‚Äôs political propaganda. On 22 March 1913 its importation was prohibited in India. In June 1913, copies were received in India of a lithographed Urdu pamphlet, \\"The Sword is the Last Resort\\". On 31 March 1914 Barakatullah‚Äôs teaching appointment was terminated by the Japanese authorities. It was followed by another similar leaflet, Feringhi ka Fareb (‚ÄúThe Deceit of the English‚Äù) : according to Ker (p135), ‚Äúit surpassed in violence Barakatullah‚Äôs previous productions, and was modelled more on the style of the publications of the Gadhar party of San Francisco with whom Barakatullah now threw in his lot.‚Äù The Ghadar episode In May 1913, G.D. Kumar had sailed from San Francisco for the Philippine Islands and had written from Manila to Taraknath Das : ‚ÄúI am going to establish base at Manila (P.I.) forwarding Dep√¥t, supervise the work near China, Hong Kong, Shanghai. Professor Barakatullah is all right in Japan.‚Äù (Ker, p237). On 22 May 1914, Barakatullah returned to San Francisco with Bhagwan Singh alias Natha Singh, the granthi (priest) of the Sikh temple at Hong Kong and joined the Yugantar Ashram and worked with Taraknath Das. With the outbreak of the War in August 1914, meetings were held at all the principal centres of the Indian population from Asia in California and Oregon and funds were raised to go back to India and join the insurrection : Barakatullah, Bhagwan Singh and Ramchandra Bharadwaj were among the speakers. (Portland (Oregon) Telegram, 7 August 1914; Fresno Republican, 23 September 1914). Reaching Berlin on time, Barakatullah met Chatto or Virendranath Chattopadhyay and sided Raja Mahendra Pratap in the Mission to Kabul. Their role was significant in indoctrinating with anti- British feelings the Indian prisoners of war held by Germany. They arrived at Herat on 24 August 1915 and were given a royal reception by the Governor. Government of Free India On 1 December 1915, Pratap's 28th birthday, he established the first Provisional Government of India at Kabul in Afghanistan, during First World War. It was a government-in-exile of Free Hindustan with Raja Mahendra Pratap as president, Maulana Barkatullah, Prime Minister, Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi, Home Minister.Contributions of Raja Mahendra Prata by Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman, International Seminar on Raja Mahendra Pratap & Barkatullah Bhopali, Barkatulla University, Bhopal, 1‚Äì3 December 2005. Anti- British forces supported his movement. But, for some obvious loyalty to the British, the Amir kept on delaying the expedition. Then they attempted to establish relations with foreign powers.‚Äù (Ker, p305). In Kabul, the Siraj-ul- Akhbar in its issue of 4 May 1916 published Raja Mahendra Pratap‚Äôs version of the Mission and its objective. He stated: \\"His Imperial Majesty the Kaiser himself granted me an audience. Subsequently, having set right the problem of India and Asia with the Imperial German Government, and having received the necessary credentials, I started towards the East. I had interviews with the Khedive of Egypt and with the Princes and Ministers of Turkey, as well as with the renowned Enver Pasha and His Imperial Majesty the Holy Khalif, Sultan-ul- Muazzim. I settled the problem of India and the East with the Imperial Ottoman Government, and received the necessary credentials from them as well. German and Turkish officers and Maulvi Barakatullah Sahib were went with me to help me; they are still with me.\\" Unable to take Raja Mahendra Pratap seriously, Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote in An Autobiography (p. 151): \\"He seemed to be a character out of medieval romance, a Don Quixote who had strayed into the twentieth century.\\" Under pressure from the British, the Afghan government withdrew its help. The Mission was closed down. References *Dictionary of National Biography, ed. S.P.

It is an \\"all-mode\\" set, operating in the High Frequency (HF) frequency range. The \\"MP\\" suffix in the name was an homage to Sako Hasegawa, the late founder of the company whose callsign was JA1MP, and who heavily influenced the design and feature set built into this radio. The FT-1000MP was Yaesu's flagship radio at the time of its introduction (1995), being both the most feature-rich and the most expensive radio that Yaesu had offered to the amateur radio community. It was manufactured for approximately 10 years in several models, including the original, the Mark-V, and Mark-V Field. Its features include Digital Signal Processing, dual receivers, up to 200 Watts of output power (in some models) and dual AC and 12VDC power (again, in some models). However, the DSP filtering is only in the audio stages, not the IF, which is the best place to put the filtering. Other advanced features include switchable Class 'A' to improve linearity of the output signal, FM capability and being designed to allow operators to install special filter circuits for improved operation in various modes. At the same time, the radio was designed to be simple enough that newly-licensed operators would be able to rapidly become expert in its use. For instance, switching between the various operating bands is done by pressing a single push button on the front panel. Numerous frequencies can be stored in the radio's memory for rapid return to them, and selecting between the two variable-frequency oscillators allows one frequency to be kept handy while the other VFO is used to chase signals from other stations. This can be especially useful during emergency operations or in contests such as 'Field Day.\\" The FT-1000MP series radios can be controlled by Yaesu's Computer Aided Transceiver system, through an optional cable, connected between the radio and a computer. The radio itself is fairly massive, even by the standards of the 1990s. However, the 5.3\\" x 16\\" (135mm x 410mm) face allows for the many controls and indicators which make this radio easy and comfortable to use. The FT-1000MP Mk V Field model has a handle installed on the right side, and feet on the left, so that it can be carried similar to an item of luggage. Prices of used units have fallen dramatically in recent years, with the introduction of higher specification units at modest prices.

Deep yellow rod-like flowers appear in spring (June‚ÄìDecember in Australia), widely scattered on spikes 4‚Äì7 cm long, followed by 7‚Äì10 cm long legumes in November‚ÄìMarch, narrow, straight or slightly curved, releasing 5‚Äì10 elliptical seeds, 5‚Äì7.5 mm long.

Only known from the high altitude granite slopes of Mount Buffalo National Park, Victoria, Australia, where it occurs above 350 meters in woodlands and heathlands often amongst granite boulders. This is one of the purest natural sources of the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine, also known as DMT, which occurs as the predominant alkaloid throughout the plant. However, due to conservation issues this species is not considered a viable source of tryptamines, as outlined below. A much more common species such as Acacia obtusifolia, should be researched instead. Recent reports on regrowth after the 2006 bushfires indicates that the phyllodes of young plants have little to no dimethyltryptamine content. This is presumed to be due to the young age of the plants versus the old growth that stood before the fire.  Conservation  * Care must be taken with this species as it consists of one population or metapopulation which has been ravaged over the years by bush fires and fungal infections. Acacia phlebophylla is listed as rare and threatened by the Victoria Department of Sustainability and Environment. There is significant concern for the viability of this population, particularly with the threat of fungal pathogens and other disturbances. (A particular species of local wasp may be associated with the transmission of this fungal pathogen.) * Looking/walking amongst them from stand to stand has been strongly advised against, due to the risk of spreading the fungal pathogen which at the moment is their greatest threat. * Though there are many accounts of bountiful regrowth, this species should not be used for the extraction of drugs for conservation reasons. Attempts at ex-situ cultivation have been mostly unsuccessful and have usually resulted in plants dying at 3 years. If cultivation is successful, it is important that plants are allowed to mature and produce seeds for eventual rehabilitation rather than used for tryptamine production. Healthy plants exist in private gardens near Gatton, Queensland as well near Meadows in South Australia and in Ireland, indicating the plant is not as recalcitrant in cultivation or restricted to its alpine environment as was once thought.

Early guns bombard on a wooden bed staked to the ground. The earliest guns were laid directly onto the ground, with earth being piled up under the muzzle end of the barrel to increase the elevation. As the size of guns increased, they began to be attached to heavy wooden frames or beds that were held down by stakes. These began to be replaced by wheeled carriages in the early 16th century.Manucy, Albert C (1949), Artillery Through the Ages: A Short Illustrated History of Cannon, National Park Service, Washington DC (pp. 3-5) Smoothbore gun carriages From the 16th to the mid-19th century, the main form of artillery remained the smoothbore cannon. By this time, the trunnion (a short axle protruding from either side of the gun barrel) had been developed, with the result that the barrel could be held in two recesses in the carriage and secured with an iron band, the \\"capsquare\\". This simplified elevation, which was achieved by raising or lowering the breech of the gun by means of a wedge called a quoin or later by a steel screw. During this time, the design of gun carriages evolved only slowly, with the trend being towards lighter carriages carrying barrels that were able to throw a heavier projectile. There were two main categories of gun carriages: Naval or garrison carriages =Naval or garrison carriages= These were designed for use aboard a ship or within a fortification and consisted of two large wooden slabs called \\"cheeks\\" held apart by bracing pieces called \\"transoms\\". The trunnions of the gun barrel sat on the top of the cheeks; the rearward part of each cheek was stepped so that the breech could be lifted by iron levers called \\"handspikes\\". Because these guns were not required to travel about, they were only provided with four small wheels called \\"trucks\\", whose main function was to roll backwards with the recoil of the gun and then allow it to be moved forward into a firing position after reloading. Traversing the gun was achieved by levering the rear of the carriage sideways with handspikes.Manucy (pp. 46-51) An improvement on this arrangement started at the end of the 18th century with the introduction of the traversing carriage, initially in fortifications but later on ships as well. This consisted of a stout wooden (and later iron) beam on which the entire gun carriage was mounted. The beam was fitted to a pivot at the centre, and to one or more trucks or \\"racers\\" at the front; the racers ran along a semi-circular iron track set in the floor called a \\"race\\". This allowed the gun to be swung in an arc over a parapet. Alternatively, the pivot could be fitted to the front of the beam and the racers at the rear, allowing the gun to fire through an embrasure. The traversing beam sloped upwards towards the rear, allowing the gun and its carriage to recoil up the slope. A Danish cannon on a typical 18th century field carriage. =Field carriages= These were designed to allow guns to be deployed on the battlefield and were provided with a pair of large wheels similar to those used on carts or wagons. The cheeks of field carriages were much narrower than those on the naval carriage and the rear end, called a \\"trail\\", rested on the ground.Manucy (p. 54) When the gun needed to be moved any distance, the trail could be lifted onto a second separate axle called a limber, which could then be towed by a team of horses or oxen. Limbers had been invented in France in about 1550.Manucy (p. 5) An innovation from the mid-18th century was the invention of the \\"block trail\\", which replaced the heavy cheeks and transoms of the \\"double-bracket\\" carriage with a single wooden spar reinforced with iron. Modern gun carriages The First World War is often considered the dawn of modern artillery because, like repeating firearms, the majority of barrels were rifled, the projectiles were conical, the guns were breech loaded and many used fixed ammunition or separate loading charges and projectiles. Some of the features of modern carriages are listed below and illustrated in the photo gallery: *Box trail - A box trail is a type of field carriage that is rectangular in shape and consists of a ladder frame often with decking. The goal was strength and stability. Box trail carriages on howitzers often had an open area near the breech to permit the high angles of fire necessary for indirect fire. On larger guns, there often was a ramp to hold ready rounds to make reloading easier. A problem with a box trail carriage is that it often limits easy access to the breech, so the barrel needs to be lowered to load and then raised for each shot which reduces the rate of fire. At the end of WW I box trail carriages became less common. Ease of loading and rate of fire were improved by providing better access to the breech. *Pole trail - A pole trail was sometimes used with early horse-drawn light artillery. The single trail resembled a pipe and was meant to be strong, light, easy to maneuver and easy to work around. After the First World War, pole trails became less common because light horse-drawn artillery was in decline. Some guns received new carriages to increase traverse, elevation and to make them suitable for motor traction. *Split trail - A split trail carriage has two trails which can be spread to provide greater stability. However, another reason for this design is to provide greater angles of elevation and traverse. Since the carriage is stationary, traverse and elevation are controlled by separate hand wheels. Another advantage of a split trail is easier access to the breech for reloading at different angles. Many guns produced since the First World War have used split trail. *Outriggers - Since the First World War many anti-aircraft guns have had collapsible two, three, and four outrigger carriages with leveling jacks to provide stability, high-angle fire, and 360¬∞ traverse. The three outrigger carriages tend to have two detachable wheels for transport, while four-outrigger carriages have four. The four-outrigger versions are often referred to as cruciform carriages because when their outriggers are deployed they form a cross. *Gun shields - Not all modern guns have shields. Before World War I, shields were intended to provide gun crews with protection at shorter ranges from the recently-invented repeating rifle and shrapnel shells when they were engaged in direct fire. During the First World War on the Western Front, machine guns and fast-firing light field guns firing shrapnel shells made massed infantry or cavalry attacks over open ground too costly, so both sides sought to protect their men and artillery behind trenches and fortifications. Since the fighting was being conducted from behind fortifications shields became less important and were sometimes done away with to save weight. After the First World War shields were mostly used on small caliber direct-fire guns ranging in size from . Guns larger than 120mm usually had the advantage of range and were indirect fire weapons so shields were sometimes omitted. *Recoil mechanism - Early guns had no mechanism to absorb recoil and the gun had to be repositioned after each shot. Later, ramps were used and the gun would roll up the ramp and gravity would roll the gun back into position. The majority of field guns produced since 1900 have had some sort of mechanical recoil mechanism. These can be broken down into two related subsystems: one absorbs the recoil while the other returns the gun to firing position. The part which absorbs the recoil is most often a hydraulic shock absorber, while the part that returns the gun to firing position is a pneumatic recuperator. This is usually shortened to hydro-pneumatic in technical documents. Another option is a hydraulic shock absorber and a spring recuperator. This is usually shortened to hydro-spring in technical documents. These systems can be identified as cylinders on top or below the gun barrel. The recoil system can either be integral with the barrel or the carriage. *Recoil spade or ground spade - The purpose of a spade is to anchor the carriage and stop it from rolling backward when the gun is fired. Spades are normally located at the end of the carriage and their shape resembles a plow or shovel. *Elevation and range - As the First World War progressed, range and elevation became more important. Range was important because each side wanted to reduce their artillery losses in a war of attrition, and one of the best ways to do that was by outranging the enemy's artillery. At first, elevation was fairly easy to accomplish because both sides just propped up their guns on ramps or earthen embankments to increase the range of their shells. Existing carriages were also modified to get higher angles of elevation. Since both sides were dug in, the most effective way to attack the enemy was vertically through indirect fire to drop high-explosive shells into the trenches. At the end of the First World War, most guns had higher angles of elevation and greater range. There was also a trend towards lighter guns firing larger projectiles since the light field guns of World War I were not effective firing light projectiles with limited explosive yield. *Equilibrators - Equilibrators can be identified because they are normally at the breech end of a gun and tend to be two vertical horns on either side of the barrel. The number of equilibrators and their orientation can vary. The object is to provide support and balance for guns with long barrels. Like recoil mechanisms they can be a combination of hydraulic, pneumatic and springs. This feature became increasingly common in guns with long barrels after the First World War. *Motor traction - The majority of guns used during the First World War were horse-drawn. Even in the Second World War, many guns were still horse-drawn. However, towards the end of the First World War, some were converted from horse traction to motor traction. The conversion process often involved replacing wooden spoked wheels with metal wheels with either solid rubber or pneumatic tires. This simple conversion was sufficient as long as the towing vehicle wasn't very fast, like a Holt tractor. But as towing vehicles became faster, the axles needed to be sprung in order to withstand the punishment of towing. Most carriages produced since the First World War have been sprung with leaf springs or torsion bars and have used rubber tires. *Limbers and caissons - Although neither limbers nor caissons are new inventions, many guns have used them. A limber is a two-wheeled cart that attaches to the trail of the gun for towing. This also often serves as a tool and ammunition wagon for the gun crew. Originally, limbers were used with horse-drawn artillery, but they can also be used with motor traction. Since the end of the Second World War, the use of limbers has declined with the increase in capabilities of motor traction. Often when viewing weight specifications for guns there will be one for travel and one for combat: normally the specification for travel will be larger because of the limber with supplies. *Large guns and multiple loads - Light guns could be transported in one piece but larger guns often broke down into multiple loads on trailers for towing. This was particularly true before motor traction because the whole gun was often too heavy for a single horse team to tow, so large guns were broken down into multiple wagon loads with each load being towed by a single horse team. Even after motor traction, many large guns had the option of being broken down into two or three wagon loads for towing, while others have the ability to detach the gun barrel from the recoil mechanism and pulled back to lay on top of the trail while being towed. This was done because long guns were barrel-heavy and could tip while being towed. During the Second World War, heavy artillery was increasingly mounted on tank chassis in order to improve mobility, and this trend has continued with today's self-propelled artillery. The advantage is this artillery can go anywhere a tank can and can be ready for action in minutes without any assembly. *Mountain or pack artillery - Some guns have the ability to be broken down into multiple loads for carrying by pack animals such as mules or by teams of men. Each load is small enough and light enough for a pack animal or man to carry. This is an advantage in mountainous terrain because there may not be roads or the terrain is too rough for towing. The parts are normally constructed with multiple joints and held together by pins. This lightness and portability has led pack guns to be used in a number of roles such as heliborne or airborne operations. Mountain guns were common during the First and Second World War, but have been largely replaced since then with rockets, mortars and recoilless guns. State and military funerals Margaret Thatcher's coffin being carried on a 13-pounder gun carriage in 2013. Gun carriages have been used to carry the coffin of fallen soldiers and officers at military funerals and holders of high office with a military connection in state funerals to their final resting place. The practice has its origins in war and appears in the nineteenth century in the Queens regulations of the British Army.Gun carriage in military, state funerals In the United Kingdom, in a state funeral, the gun carriage bearing the coffin is drawn by sailors from the Royal Navy rather than horses. (This tradition dates from the funeral of Queen Victoria; the horses drawing the gun carriage bolted, so ratings from the Royal Navy hauled it to the Royal Chapel at Windsor.) This distinguishing feature is not invariable, however, as shown by the use of naval ratings rather than horses at the ceremonial funeral for Lord Mountbatten in 1979, which was one of a number of features on that occasion which emphasized Mountbatten's lifelong links with the Royal Navy. In state funerals in the United States, a caisson (a two-wheeled ammunition wagon), is used in place of a gun carriage.

A small limestone island on the Yucat√°n Peninsula's Gulf coast with only a tidal inlet separating it from the mainland, Jaina served as an elite Maya burial site, and is notable for the high number of fine ceramic figurines excavated there.Coe. The term \\"Jaina\\" translates to \\"Temple in the Water\\".  The site  Jaina Island and other major Classic Era Maya communities. Both Jaina Island and nearby Piedras Island (Isla Piedras) were the sites of small towns or villages. Jaina was settled 300 CE,Muren. lasting until its abandonment some time circa 1200 CE. The principal occupation occurred near the end of this period, during the Late Classic and Terminal Classic eras.Inurreta, sect. 13. Present-day ruins consist of two small plaza groups and a ballcourt. Jaina Island's notability is tied to its estimated 20,000 graves, of which over 1,000 have been archaeologically excavated. Within each grave, the human remains are accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery as well as one or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands. The name of this island necropolis probably comes from the Yucat√°n Maya phrase hail na, or ‚Äúwatery house‚Äù. Its western location may have been tied to the setting sun, and therefore to death. The source of the burial population is as yet unknown, but likely comes from Edzna, and the nearby Chenes and Puuc regions.Ball, p. 438.  Jaina style figurines  Handcrafted male figurine. Molded female figurine. Handcrafted male figurine. Due to sheer numbers found here, these figurines have become known as \\"Jaina-style figurines\\" whether or not they were found on the Jaina Island. In fact, these figurines are far more numerous at inland Maya sites, such as the Usumacinta River delta, than on the island.Scott, p 269. Early Jaina-style figures are naturalistic, delicately detailed, and \\"generally regarded as the finest figurine art produced throughout the ancient Americas\\".Ball, p.438. While both solid and hollow figurines have been found, the latter predominate and are usually fitted with a whistle, or with clay pellets that produce a rattle-like sound. Like the figurines themselves, it is not known what function(s) the whistles and rattles served. Made of orange clay and originally painted, mostly in ochres and blues, the figurines are generally 10 - 25 inches (25 ‚Äì 65 cm) tall, rarely more.Kubler, p. 266. These figures also represent Mayan practices of scarification and the significance of class in Mayan society. Details such as marks on the figure's face as well as clothing and jewelry can be used to signify social status of the figure. All the figurines on Jaina Island seem to have been produced specifically as burial accompaniments.Ball, p. 438 Due, if nothing else, to space considerations, few if any of these figurines could have been produced on the island itself. Many of the molded figurines have been linked to workshops at Jonuta, some distance to the south and west.Scott, p. 269. Created in a realistic style, the figurines are an ethnographic treasure trove, affording a glimpse into the physical features, dress, and daily life of the late Classic Maya elite. Their delicate detail reveals hallmarks of social status and the figurines are often shown with tools and other accoutrements, providing us three-dimensional snapshots of long-vanished implements. = Portraiture? = The idiosyncratic details shown in the earlier phase figurines have led one researcher to declare that they are \\"genuine essays in portraiture\\",Corson. while another adds that the figurines \\"faithfully describe age, status, and expression\\". Expressive and individual as they are, it has thus far proven to be difficult to determine the subjects of these figurines. For example, it is not possible to correlate the figurines with their associated burial. In particular, the gender of the figurines only randomly seem to match the gender of the burial‚Äîfemale figurines may accompany male burials and vice versa, while child burials are often accompanied by adult figurines. Certain figurines, and styles of figurines, have been identified as deities. Others hint at myths or legends. It has also been suggested that the figurines represent ancestors, distant or immediate. The question of portraiture may only be resolved when the function of these grave goods is itself resolved. = Chronological phases = In a 1975 article, Christopher Corson posited three phases based on the figurines' craftsmanship and production method: :Phase I AD 600 ‚Äì 800 :Phase II AD 800 ‚Äì 1000 :Campeche phase AD 1000 ‚Äì 1200 While proposed dates vary considerably from researcher to researcher,For example, Kubler's dates are 200 years earlier than Corson's. such a division is useful for analyzing the changes in production methods and perhaps the cultural changes behind these. Almost all Phase I figurines are hand-modeled, with pigment applied after the clay had dried, and show the greatest degree of craftsmanship. While certain recurring subjects and styles can be identified, there is a widespread uniqueness to the figurines from this phase. Phase II is marked by the creation of figurines from molds. Often these molded figurines would be enhanced through incisions or the addition of thin clay strips and adornments. While casting increases productivity‚Äîno doubt at least a partial explanation for its adoption‚Äîit decreases artistic opportunities, and so Phase II figurines are generally less innovative, less detailed, and less idiosyncratic than those of Phase I. The Campeche Phase was marked by the almost complete adoption of molded figurines, often whitewashed, preponderantly featuring a standing woman with upraised arms. This subject, variously identified with the goddesses Xochiquetzal or, mistakenly, Ix Chel, is so prevalent during this phase that it outnumbers all other subjects combined, suggesting that burial practices had come under the influence of a new, perhaps imported, ideology.Corson, p. 67. (See examples of a Jonuta Campeche phase figurine and a Jaina Campeche phase figurine).  Gallery  Image:Jaina flute 1.jpgA ceramic flute. Note the miniature head.

John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park is a Florida State Park located on Key Largo in Florida. It includes approximately 70 nautical square miles (240 km¬≤) of adjacent Atlantic Ocean waters. The park is approximately 25 miles in length and extends 3 miles into the Atlantic Ocean. It was the first underwater park in the United States. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 14, 1972. The primary attractions of the park are the coral reefs (such as Molasses Reef) and their associated marine life. In Fiscal Year 2004 the park had more than a million visitors, making it the most popular park in the Florida State Parks system. The Florida Keys and the Flower Garden Banks in the Gulf of Mexico off the Texas coast are the only living coral reef formations in the continental United States. History Plans to designate the reefs off Key Largo for a park started in the 1930s. The state-sanctioned Everglades National Park Commission proposed a national park for the Everglades, including the reefs off Key Largo. Opposition from property owners, outdoorsmen, and Monroe County Commissioners stopped the plan. When Everglades National Park was created in 1947, the boundaries did not include Key Largo or any of the reefs. By the late 1950s, citizens were growing concerned of the damage occurring to the reefs along the Florida Keys. Seashells, corals, sponges, sea horses, and other marine life were being hammered, chiseled, and even dynamited from the reefs to provide souvenirs for tourists. Dr. Gilbert L. Voss of the Marine Institute of Miami and John D. Pennekamp, an editor with the Miami Herald, teamed up to lead a fight to protect the reefs from further damage. Pennekamp had strong credentials for the fight. He had been active in establishing Everglades National Park, had been the first chairman of the Florida Board of Parks and Historic Memorials, and had been a consultant with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. These efforts led the Florida Board of Parks and Historic Memorials to designate the state-controlled reefs off Key Largo a permanent preserve. In the spring of 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed the adjacent, federally controlled area of the reefs as the Key Largo Coral Reef Preserve. Florida Governor Leroy Collins later changed the name of the park to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, in recognition of John Pennekamp's efforts to save marine life. A land base and access to U.S. 1 (the Overseas Highway) were acquired by purchase and donation. The park opened in 1963.* History of John Pennekamp State Park at Florida Keys History Museum Recreational activities The reefs may be viewed from glass-bottom boats, snorkeling, and scuba diving.

It is located on Highway 28A, northeast of Edmonton. The town was named for William R. Gibbons who settled in the area and was created from the merger of two smaller communities: Astleyville and Battenburg. Gibbons is situated on the southern banks of the Sturgeon River which is a major tributary of the North Saskatchewan River.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Gibbons recorded a population of 3,159 living in 1,136 of its 1,223 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 3,030. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Gibbons had a population of 3,030 living in 1,075 of its 1,111 total dwellings, a 14.7% change from its 2006 population of 2,642. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. The population of the Town of Gibbons according to its 2007 municipal census is 2,848.  Sports and recreation  Gibbons is home to many sporting facilities, leagues, and teams. As a family community, the majority of activities are orientated to youth, but many adult options are also available. The Gibbons arena is home to a number of ice hockey teams and leagues in the winter. In partnership with the community of Bon Accord, Alberta, the CNN Spurs minor hockey program offers teams from initiation to midget level, as well as a female program. The Gibbons Jr. C Broncos, playing in the Noralta Junior Hockey League, also call the Gibbons Arena home. The East Sturgeon Gentlemen's Hockey League, consisting of 11 teams, play the majority of their games in Gibbons as well as the surrounding communities. Adjoining with the Gibbons Arena is the Gibbons Curling Club. This facility features four sheets of ice, ice-level seating, as well as a recently renovated lounge. The lounge, popular with the town's residents in the winter months, includes food and beverage service, table seating, and an above ice viewing area complete with sheet cameras. The facility runs men's, ladies', mixed, farmers', and junior leagues. It also hosts the annual Saville Country Classic Junior Bonspiel, where highly competitive junior level teams from across the province compete. In the spring and summer, minor baseball and soccer teams are offered. The town has numerous soccer pitches and ball diamonds, with the majority of them located in the area surrounding Landing Trail School and at the Jack Hogg Sports Grounds north of Gibbons School and the Gibbons Arena. A successful recreational slow pitch league is also run, which includes an annual wind up tournament in July. Lacrosse is also becoming increasingly popular with Gibbons' youth. Although the town does not yet host its own teams, the surrounding communities of Fort Saskatchewan, Sherwood Park, St. Albert, and Edmonton run programs for minor, junior, men's, and ladies' levels.  Education  As part of the Sturgeon School Division, Gibbons is the site of the following schools: Landing Trail Elementary, Gibbons School Elementary and Junior High, and the Sturgeon Learning Centre, which focuses on high school and adult learning.

Sheikhan is the owner of a retail chain of tobacco and tattoo stores. Sheikhan is known for venting his frustration in ways that have drawn the ire of fellow players. At the 2005 World Series of Poker (WSOP) he got into a much-publicized war of words with Mike Matusow after Sheikhan slammed the table when seeing a flop on a hand he was not involved in. Both players got a penalty since Matusow used a vulgarity after Sheikhan made the inappropriate reaction that gave away what his hand was, thus giving other players who were still in the hand free information that may have altered the outcome of the hand. Sheikhan was involved in several more incidents, one involving Phil Hellmuth on Poker After Dark when Hellmuth accused Shawn of refusing to stop talking while he was playing in a hand with Annie Duke, though in fact the entire table were conversing. In March 2006, Sheikhan made the final four of NBC's National Heads-Up Poker Championship (during the early rounds of which he told Gus Hansen, whom he eliminated, to just \\"throw away\\" his cards - Sheikhan had made Four of a kind), earning $125,000. He lost to eventual winner Ted Forrest. In July 2007 Sheikhan placed 3rd in the World Series of Poker No Limit Deuce to Seven Lowball event. He also won a Poker After Dark title defeating a field which consisted of Phil Laak, Phil Hellmuth, Daniel Negreanu, Mike Matusow and Antonio Esfandiari. This first place finish earned him $120,000. He has also appeared in the GSN television series High Stakes Poker in which he intentionally ripped and broke an expensive pair of Matusow's sunglasses. As of January 2015, his total live tournament winnings exceed $1,460,000. His 10 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,160,910 of those winnings.World Series of Poker Earnings , worldseriesofpoker.com While driving in Las Vegas in 1999 during heavy rain, Sheikhan lost control of his vehicle and collided with another car, resulting in the death of one of its passengers.  Arrest and possible deportation  Sheikhan, a resident alien since he was nine years old, was arrested at his Las Vegas home on August 30, 2007 for violating his immigration status due to a 1995 conviction for misdemeanor sexual battery on a child under 18, where he served nine months in prison and 5 years probation. According to Sheikhan's lawyer, David Chesnoff, the young woman in this case was a 17-year-old girl that Sheikhan knew when he was in his early 20s. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actively searches for foreign nationals who were convicted of a sexual crime against children and then tries to get them deported. He was detained on an immigration hold for 1 week facing deportation proceedings however those proceedings have been since halted.

The community is located in the township of The Archipelago in the Parry Sound District. Community name Pointe au Baril was named after the barrel on the point that originally (1870s) marked the treacherous entry to the main channel from the open water of Georgian Bay. Early fur traders from Penetanguishene apparently lost a canoe near the point. Their canoe included a barrel of whiskey that was found by stranded traders the next spring. After a drinking spree the barrel was left on the point as a beacon. French mariners were soon calling it Pointe-au-Baril. Later this marker was improved to include a lantern in the barrel that would be lit by the first fisherman returning inland to light the way for the rest of the boats. =Pointe au Baril Station= Pointe au Baril may refer to the original Barrel on the Point reference or the actual village, built around a train station, about six nautical miles (11 km, 7 miles) away. Highway 69 follows the same path as the railway and they both run past the east tip of what is known as the Main Channel. This channel is a well marked route from the village to the lighthouse. The village has a North Shore and a South Shore road but islander travel is by boat. The village is referred to as The Station by most residents. Pointe au Baril Station is well suited for launching water craft and is supported by many marinas and a substantial public dock. Historic landmarks The Pointe Au Baril Lighthouse =Lighthouse= The point is lit by the recently automated lighthouse. This historic lighthouse opens its doors for tours in the summer months. The lighthouse is a part of a light system which includes a range tower (about one half nautical mile behind the lighthouse) and a turn buoy (nearly three nautical miles offshore from the lighthouse) which work together to allow safe passage through the many shoals that cover the eastern coast of Georgian Bay (). =Firetower= The Pointe au Baril firetower lookout was erected in the 1920s to detect forest fires. This 80 foot light-steel tower was part of the Parry Sound Fire District tower system. It stood near the centre of the village, just west of the railway tracks and near the bay on a small hill. When aerial fire fighting techniques were employed by the province many of the towers like this one were disassembled in the early 1970s. The footings, however, are still there to this day. Fishing and logging Pointe au Baril became a community to support commercial fishing in the 1870s. The last fishing operation based in Pointe au Baril was shut down in the 1980s. A lumber industry existed in the area during these same years. The pine, hemlock and yellow birch forestry ended in the 1940s, shortly after the end of World War II. Today A Pointe Au Baril full moon The area is now primarily a cottage community on Highway 69. The channels and islands of the region make it a boating, fishing and islander paradise. It has also become a destination for snowmobiling in the winter months. Among the many islands there is the historic Ojibway Club founded by Hamilton Davis in 1906 as a hotel. Many of Davis's descendents still summer in Pointe au Baril to this day. The population grows from a winter low of about 250 to 300 to a summer high of 8000 or more. Additional growth is expected in the future as Highway 400 is extended past the community. With the demolition of Larry's Tavern for the expansion of the highway, there remains one restaurant, The Haven, which is open all year, The Harbour View, which is only open during the summer months and the Shell Station Deli. There are also two chip wagons located in Pointe au Baril, one open only during the summer, while the other remains open all year. Community events in Pointe au Baril include the Winter Whirl carnival, held the first weekend in February, Canada Day festivities, and the Pickerel Dinner and Annual Lobster Fest held the third weekend in July. The ducky race is another local festival held in Pointe au Baril organized by the North Eastern Georgian Bay Snowmobile Club right in downtown Pointe au Baril. Summertime events also include Arts on the Bay Dinner theatre in the Pointe au Baril Community Centre. Pointe au Baril has a community centre with a library in it. The town also offers an ice rink and playground. Pointe au Baril also has a Nursing Station and an Emergency response team. Pointe au Baril's cottage community is largely water access and is home to many marinas. Early exploration The area was explored by Samuel de Champlain in 1615. A monument was erected in the 1940s to commemorate his travels through the area. It can be found near the newly renovated Ojibway Club, a favoured gathering place for many of the islanders. Transportation Intercity motor coach service to the community is provided by Ontario Northland along its Toronto‚ÄìBarrie‚ÄìParry Sound‚ÄìSudbury route local schedule; it is bypassed by express schedules, but still receives daily service northbound and southbound. Literature Pointe au Baril is also a setting of John Irving's novel Last Night in Twisted River, where many of the places are described in the winter setting, including nearby islands. Pointe au Baril is also in a nouvel in the book of Alicia Munroe du Cote de Castle Rock.

It is located on Highway 40 approximately northwest of Hinton and west of Edmonton. Grande Cache overlooks the Smoky River, is at the northern edge of Alberta's Rockies, and serves as the gateway to the Willmore Wilderness Park. The hamlet held town status prior to 2019.  History  The New Town of Grande Cache was incorporated on September 1, 1966. The purpose of creating a new town was to open the area for the development of coal mines. New town status allowed the town to use the Government of Alberta as a guarantor for debt. Construction of Grande Cache began in 1969. By 1971 a hospital, schools, stores, and the first homes were built. Grande Cache received town status on September 1, 1983. The community suffered a boom-bust cycle due to the dependence on a single employer that depended on a single commodity: coal. In an attempt to diversify the economy additional industries were encouraged to develop in the area. This included a wood chip plant and a federal prison operated by the Correctional Service of Canada. In recent years, wilderness tourism is an increasing industry. In September 2018, Grande Cache's Town Council determined that, due to a reduction in population and the subsequent loss in tax revenue, the town was no longer financially sustainable. On September 25, 2018, town residents voted to dissolve the town into a hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Municipal District (MD) of Greenview No. 16. Out of 1,100 ballots cast in the vote, 1,065 were votes in favour of dissolution, 32 were in favour of remaining a town, and 3 ballots were rejected. The dissolution came into effect on January 1, 2019, rendering Grande Cache a hamlet in the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16.  Geography  Grande Cache Lake The town is built on a plateau that is just below the subalpine level of the Rocky Mountains. The town site is surrounded by three valleys: to the north is the Smoky River; to the west is the Sulphur River; to the south is Victor Lake and Grande Cache Lake.

San Vicente Boulevard is a major northwest-southeast thoroughfare located in the western portion of the metropolitan area of Los Angeles, CA. Built in the early 20th century and named for the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica that had previously occupied the area, the boulevard originally ran from the Soldiers' Home (Sawtelle Veterans Home) in Los Angeles to Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. This tree-lined street was wide, with trolley lines used by the Los Angeles Pacific Electric Railway running down its center. It was oiled and surfaced in 1906 and, when completed, it \\"made one of the finest drives in the country.\\"Luther A. Ingersoll: Ingersoll's Century History, Santa Monica Bay Cities, 1908 Today the boulevard begins at Venice Boulevard between Crenshaw Boulevard and La Brea Avenue and travels in a northwesterly direction towards Beverly Hills. The roadway splits into two streets past La Cienega Boulevard: the western branch becoming Burton Way, which eventually becomes South Santa Monica Boulevard and connects directly to downtown Beverly Hills. The northern branch remains as San Vicente Boulevard itself, passes Beverly Center, continues north into West Hollywood and becomes North Clark Street at Sunset Boulevard (served by Metro Local lines 30 and 330). A separate stretch of road with the same name runs from Santa Monica to Brentwood. Addressing Locating an address on San Vicente Boulevard can be especially tricky. The easternmost end at Venice Boulevard begins with the number 4600 and increases to the west. By Los Angeles convention, since there is no E. San Vicente Boulevard, i.e. the boulevard does not go east of Main Street, San Vicente Boulevard is not termed W. San Vicente Boulevard. The address numbers continue to increase up to 6600 at Wilshire Boulevard. Two complications begin at this point. First, since San Vicente Boulevard does not follow the overall grid of Los Angeles but rather a slowly arcing curve, the intersection at Wilshire Boulevard is chosen as the point where the numbering switches from east-west numbers to north-south numbers with respect to the city grid. Secondly, between Wilshire Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard, the median of San Vicente forms a border between Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. The east side of San Vicente is known as S. San Vicente Boulevard, with numbering decreasing between 700 at the Wilshire end and 400 at the La Cienega end‚Äîeven numbers only. The west side of San Vicente is known as N. San Vicente Boulevard, with numbering increasing between 100 at the Wilshire end and 300 at the La Cienega end‚Äîodd numbers only. North of La Cienega, both sides of the street are in Los Angeles. The numbering continues accordingly as 400 S. San Vicente Boulevard. The street becomes N. San Vicente Boulevard at Gracie Allen Drive. As in the rest of Los Angeles, the numbers at the city's grid axis start with 100. Numbers 0-99 are not used. At 300 N. San Vicente Boulevard, the boulevard enters the city of West Hollywood at Beverly Boulevard. The street name and numbering do not change. The street terminates at Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood at 1100 N. San Vicente. A second San Vicente Boulevard begins in the Brentwood neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles. This street is unrelated to the former except in name. For the same reason as before, this street is not known as W. San Vicente Boulevard. However, some navigation systems call this street West San Vicente to differentiate it from the other. This San Vicente Boulevard begins at Wilshire Boulevard west of Interstate 405. This second intersection of Wilshire and San Vicente Boulevard is west of the former. Once again, the numbering increases to the west, beginning with the number 11400 at Wilshire Boulevard. As the street continues, it eventually crosses the border of the city of Santa Monica, and does not change names, at Santa Monica's 26th Street. The last number on San Vicente Boulevard in Los Angeles' address grid is 13100. On the Santa Monica side, the numbering follows that city's grid and begins at 2600 and decreases towards the ocean. At Ocean Avenue, San Vicente Boulevard has its western terminus at the number 100. San Vicente curves diagonally and cuts through both east-west and north-south streets, allowing quick access between Downtown Los Angeles and Beverly Hills or West Hollywood. Current construction In summer 2011, construction was to begin on the San Vicente median between Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. Planning meetings have taken place in the affected Olympic Park Neighborhood Council, Pico Neighborhood Council, and the Mid-City West Community Council. Money for the project is coming from these three councils and the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles (CRA/LA). The Olympic Park Neighborhood Council is committing $30,000 for the project. According to the Beverly Press (4/21/2011), \\"The plan calls for the medians between Fairfax Avenue and Pico Boulevard to be adorned with new trees, a walking path and seating areas. Trees and plaques at the intersections at Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, identifying them as gateways, will also be installed.\\"  References  Streets in Los Angeles Streets in Los Angeles County, California Boulevards in the United States Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles Streets in West Hollywood, California Westside (Los Angeles County) ","title":"San Vicente Boulevard"},{"id":"3521387","title":"List of mayors of Anderson, Indiana"},{"id":"3521389","text":"The Inglorious Bastards (, literally: \\"That damned armored train\\") is a 1978 Italian action/war film directed by Enzo G. Castellari, written by Sandro Continenza, Sergio Grieco, Franco Marotta, Romano Migliorini, and Laura Toscano, and starring Bo Svenson, Peter Hooten, Fred Williamson, Michael Pergolani, and Jackie Basehart. The film score was written by Francesco De Masi. The film, which concerns a group of prisoners who are drafted into a special war mission in 1944, is a loose remake of the 1967 American film The Dirty Dozen. The film attracted critics' attention again after Quentin Tarantino used the title as the inspiration for the title of his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds. The Tarantino film is not a remake of The Inglorious Bastards, but contains a few references to it, including the appearances of Svenson as an American colonel and Castellari as a Nazi general (although credited as \\"himself\\"). Plot In France in 1944, American soldiers Berle, a deserter; Nick Colasanti, a petty thief; Fred, nicknamed \\"Assassin\\"; Tony, a mutineer; and Lieutenant Yeager (arrested for refusing to execute orders to kill, among others, women and children) are sentenced to death for their crimes and are shipped to a prisoners' camp near the Ardennes. During the journey to the camp, the convoy stops because of a flat tire, and Fred and Berle are ordered to change it. Their work is interrupted by a Luftwaffe air raid. The five criminals take advantage of the attack and escape. Yeager takes command of the group and decides to find a way to neutral Switzerland. On their way, they stop at an abandoned factory in the French countryside to rest and refill their supplies. While they eat, the upper floor of the building collapses, and a German soldier appears from between the hay bundles. Captured by Yeager's group, he tells them that he is in fact an escaped prisoner sentenced to death just like them. Although Tony and Fred want to kill him, Yeager prefers to take him along in case the Nazis attack again. Later, the group runs into a German patrol, and the captured Nazi soldier proves very helpful. He convinces the patrol that the Americans are his prisoners, and they manage to kill part of the patrol and escape. After this, the group see a group of beautiful German nurses bathing naked in a river. Nick suggests the Americans pretend to be Nazi soldiers, and they are able to get on friendly terms with the girls. However, after they see Fred, who is black, the nurses realize the men are Americans and start shooting at them. Tony, Nick, Berle and Fred run away to a nearby camp. But the situation does not get any better. Some German soldiers arrive at the camp, and Yeager sends the captured Nazi to talk to them. After discussing something with them, the German soldier realizes that the newly arrived are in fact Americans and shouts: \\"Americans! Americans!\\" The German soldiers kill him and Yeager's group return fire, killing the Germans. Yeager later learns he made a mistake from Colonel Buckner; the squad he shot at actually consisted of Americans dressed in Nazi uniform who were supposed to accomplish an important mission. At this point, the only solution is to trust the group led by Yeager with this task. Meanwhile, Berle meets Nicole, a French nurse affiliated with the Resistance movement. He falls in love with her but it is Tony she is crazy about. Another problem arises as Fred falls into the enemy's hands. Yeager, Tony, Berle and Nick attack the Nazi fortifications and free their friend. After the group is reunited, Colonel Buckner explains to them the plan, according to which they are to assault an armored train shipping a prototype of the V-2 missile. According to the plan, the train is supposed to pass a mined bridge. But there are unexpected problems as Nick is unable to contact his comrades due to a broken transmitter, and is killed in an attempt to warn them. Berle is killed by the train driver, and when all hope seems to be lost, Lieutenant Yeager decides the outcome of the battle in a heroic act, in which he blows up the train with the missiles and himself on board, destroying the station assaulted by the Nazis. Ultimately, the only ones to survive are Fred (who is wounded but escapes into the French fields), Colonel Buckner, and Tony, who manages to return to Nicole. Cast * Bo Svenson as Lt.

The first attempt to make this movie took place in 1976 in the United States and involved an approach proposed by Bo Richards to filmmaker Ted V. Mikels. Mikels rejected it on the grounds that a movie pitched as a Dirty Dozen follow-up was a decade late, and any insistence on preserving a title containing the word \\"bastard\\" would spell box office failure in the 1970s. The film was released in the United States as The Inglorious Bastards; it was also issued as Hell's Heroes and as Deadly Mission on home video. The American success of the blaxploitation genre led distributors to reedit this film and distribute it as G.I. Bro; in this version, scenes were cut to make Fred Williamson the lead character. The tagline on this version was \\"If you're a kraut, he'll take you out!\\" The reissue title for this film was Counterfeit Commandos. Severin Films released a three-disc set that features a newly remastered transfer of the film, an interview with Quentin Tarantino (the director of the similarly titled film Inglourious Basterds) and director Enzo G. Castellari, trailers, a tour of shooting locations, a documentary on the making of the film with interviews with Bo Svenson, Fred Williamson, and Enzo G. Castellari, and a CD with the soundtrack. Both spellings appear on the DVDs: one uses the word \\"Bastards\\" while the other uses \\"Basterds.\\" Reception The film holds a 100% rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 5 reviews. In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that the film is \\"totally lacking in realism or historical perspective\\" as well as that it \\"does boast some tolerably rousing action passages, notably the climactic sequence on the train.\\" See also * Filthy Thirteen * Macaroni Combat * Spaghetti Western * War film References External links  Quel maledetto treno blindato at the Grindhouse Cinema Database 1978 films 1970s action thriller films 1970s action war films Italian films Italian action thriller films Italian action adventure films Italian-language films German- language films French-language films English-language films Films directed by Enzo G.

It was first released in 2005. From 2005 to 2007, TAG Fragrance Company was part of Global Gillette, until Gillette was bought out by Procter & Gamble and dissolved. In 2016, My Imports USA acquired the TAG brand from Procter & Gamble. My Imports USA plans to launch new TAG items in early 2017. History TAG is a re-incarnation of Right Guard Body Spray, released in 2002. Right Guard Body Spray was discontinued after several months due to very low sales. Gillette then spent the next few years trying to find how to successfully market a body spray for teenage boys. As a result of their research, TAG was released in the beginning of 2005. Gillette decided not to include any sign that Gillette manufactured the product on the product itself or in the advertising. It was decided that Gillette's reputation from its other products would detract from the sale of TAG. Marketing The marketing campaign focuses on what the company describes as the \\"old man fantasies\\" of being approached by attractive women. The product's packaging, which is charcoal-grey and depicts silhouettes of women, uses fragrance names evoking success in dating. The product launched a line called the TAG Signature Series in July 2009, which reintroduced three scents with new packaging which featuring basketball star Carmelo Anthony, skateboarder Rob Dyrdek, and rapper Ludacris.

On May 11, 2001, while at Pacific, Houlton pitched a complete game no hitter with an 8‚Äì0 victory over UC Riverside. =Houston Astros= In the 2001 MLB draft, the Houston Astros drafted Houlton in the 11th round.

As one of the players brought to the team by General Manager Paul DePodesta and then Manager Jim Tracy, Houlton's fortune's faded when a new management team took over the Dodgers prior to the 2006 season. He failed to make the major league team out of spring training and spent the year with the Las Vegas 51s in AAA. In 2006, Houlton struggled in the minor leagues, going 9‚Äì11 with a 5.60 ERA at Las Vegas and did not get called up. In 2007, going 5‚Äì4 with a 3.90 ERA over the first half of the season, Houlton was called up to the Dodgers on July 1, 2007. Houlton ended up at 0‚Äì2 with a 4.18 ERA in twenty-eight innings with the Dodgers. In January 2008, the Dodgers sold Houlton's contract to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of the Japanese Pacific League.Dodgers pitcher D.J. Houlton to play in Japan =Nippon Professional Baseball= Houlton did not have a set role in his first season with the Hawks, as he started the season in the bullpen as the team's set-up man. Assigned the number #00, Houlton eventually became the team's closer in the absence of the team's ace closer Takahiro Mahara. Until the end of May, Houlton was regularly able to close games, many times getting six-out saves. However, after blowing three straight saves at the end of May and beginning of June (all in Interleague play), Houlton was demoted to ni- gun. He was recalled in July as a starter, and stayed in that role the rest of the season. He recorded six quality starts, while going seven or more innings four times. In the 2008 season, Houlton went 4‚Äì7 with 6 saves and a 4.27 ERA in 28 games (11 starts). Reassigned with the number #54 in 2009 and being pegged a starter from the outset as Mahara was finally healthy, Houlton was able to settle into a role early on, a luxury he did not have the previous season. He responded immediately, giving the Hawks quality starts in each of his first eleven starts and posting a 5‚Äì3 record with a 2.13 ERA in that span. Houlton was able to maintain this torrid pace, as he went less than five innings only once during the season. He finished with a solid 11‚Äì8 record and a 2.89 ERA with 138 strikeouts in 171 innings.

It is managed by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. The hospital has a Regional Virus Centre, which is one of the four laboratories in the United Kingdom on the WHO list of laboratories able to perform PCR for rapid diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in humans. History =Early history= The Frederick Street Hospital Map of the various buildings in the hospital complex. The Royal Victoria Hospital has its origins in a number of successive institutions, beginning in 1797 with The Belfast Fever Hospital and General Dispensary, located in Factory Row (although the dispensary originally opened in 1792). This moved to West Street in 1799, and then to Frederick Street in 1817. In 1847 the hospital separated from the General Dispensary and became the Belfast General Hospital. In 1875 it gained the royal charter, becoming the Belfast Royal Hospital, and in 1899 it was renamed the Royal Victoria Hospital. In 1903 it moved from Frederick Street to its present (Grosvenor Road) site. =Grosvenor Road= The first hospital building on the Grosvenor Road site was designed in 1899 by architects Henman and Cooper of Birmingham in a partial adoption of the English Revival style. The design incorporates a turreted verandah-balcony extending along a series of ward pavilions. The hospital became the first air-conditioned public building in the world when Belfast's Sirocco Works installed the system. It was officially opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 27 July 1903. The King Edward Building, built to commemorate the life of the late king, was completed in 1915. The Royal Maternity Hospital was officially opened on the site previously occupied by the Belfast Asylum, to the immediate south of the main hospital, in 1933. Later additions included a free-standing radiology department and theatre block in 1964. alt=Large red six-bladed fan, fitted to a steel girder, enclosed inside a concrete and brick funnel. A slight addition to the main front of the West Belfast site was new railings (on Falls Road, going west from the junction of Grosvenor and Springfield Roads) completed in 2000. The wavy pattern of the railings erected was reminiscent of the structure of DNA. There were little yellow Xs and Ys detailed for X- and Y-chromosomes, and portraits (laser-cut in sheet steel) chart the progress of a human life from birth to the age of 100.Lonely Planet Website www.lonelyplanet.com : Worldguide to Northern Ireland / Belfast / Sights By Lonely Planet Guides. In February 2003 the hospital was designated as one of the nine acute hospitals in the acute hospital network of Northern Ireland on which healthcare would be focused under the government health policy 'Developing Better Services'. The Prince of Wales opened a new 400 bed, seven storey building, which incorporated new intensive care and fracture units built at a cost of ¬£42 million, in September 2003. New imaging and central decontamination centres were added in 2007. Construction started on a new critical care facility, being built at a cost of ¬£150 million, in 2008. However, due to construction difficulties, the project is understood to be running at least five years late and will not be fully open until 2021. Staff and patients Frank Pantridge, the \\"father of emergency medicine\\", was a cardiac consultant at the hospital for over 30 years. During his time at the Royal, Pantridge developed the portable defibrillator, which revolutionised emergency medicine by allowing patients to be treated early by paramedics.Bill Duff, \\"Frank Pantridge (obituary)\\". The Guardian, 5 January 2005. Retrieved 13 January 2012. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) politician Carmel Hanna worked as a nurse in the hospital. Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) politician David Ervine was admitted on 7 January 2007 and died there the following day. During the Northern Ireland Troubles, the hospital was regarded as one of the best hospitals in the world for the treatment of gunshot wounds. Gunshots to the knee (associated with paramilitary punishment attacks in Northern Ireland) enabled surgeons at the hospital to gain renown with their treatment of such injuries. Performance In November 2013 it was reported that the Royal College of Emergency Medicine considered that issues faced by clinicians in the casualty department are probably worse than anywhere else in the UK. The Royal Victoria Hospital has, in recent years, been criticised by health professionals due to its long waiting time at Accident and Emergency; this has resulted in patients and emergency ambulances being delayed and having to queue outside the hospital for hours at a time.

Original use The term comes from the rigorous terminology of the Meistersinger guilds of the 15th to 18th century who used it to refer to their songs and the songs of the predecessors, the minnesingers of the 12th to 14th century. In their work, a Bar is not a single stanza (which they called a Liet or Ges√§tz); rather, it is the whole song. The word Bar is most likely a shortening of Barat, denoting a skillful thrust in fencing. The term was used to refer to a particularly artful song ‚Äì the type one composes in songwriters' guilds. The AAB pattern does, however, describe each stanza in a Meistersinger's Bar, which is divided into two Stollen (A), which are collectively termed the Aufgesang, followed by an Abgesang. The musical form thus contains two repetitions of one melody (Stollen ‚Äì 'stanzas') followed by a different melody (Abgesang ‚Äì 'aftersong'). One such tune (Ton in Meistersinger terminology) by Hans Folz (c1437‚Äì1513) illustrates this: File:Vielchenweise.svg Note that the B section is not necessarily the same length as each A section. The B section can also incorporate parts of the A section's phrase: in the above example, the final 14 notes of the B section match the final 14 notes of each A section (see also Rundkanzone). In this example, the 17 never-repeated notes starting the B section would have been called a Steg by the Meistersingers: literally, \\"bridge\\"; whence comes the term for a contrasting section in popular music. Modern use Composer Richard Wagner in act III of his opera Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, used the word Bar incorrectly as referring to a stanza of the prize song. This was based on his misreading of Wagenseil. In addition, Bach's famous biographer Spitta in his monumental 1873‚Äì80 biography, emphasized the role of Lutheran chorales, almost all of which are in AAB form, in what he considered the most mature of Bach's cantatas. Composer Johannes Brahms claimed the AAB form of the chorale \\"Jesu, meine Freude\\" generates larger formal structures in Bach's motet of the same name. Subsequent popularity and study of the use of AAB stanzas in Bach's and Wagner's works has led to wide adoption of the term Bar form for any song or larger musical form that can be rationalized to a three part AAB form with the first part repeating. Such AAB forms may be found in works ranging from Lutheran chorales to \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" to songs by Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms. Bartok made use of the Bar form in the 20th Century, and most blues follow the pattern \\"A1A2B.\\" The German musicologist Alfred Lorenz, in his studies of Wagner, abstracted the concept of barform to include anything resembling an AAB structure at any level of scale: > \\"The essence of the Bar does not reside in the actual length, but in the > distribution of its powers. Whether the Bar occupies 3 measures or 1,000 is > irrelevant; it is always a regular Bar if [its] essence is fulfilled: a > double appearance as against a single balancing occurrence of equal > weight.\\"Alfred Lorenz, Das Geheimnis der Form bei Richard Wagner, vol. 1 > (Berlin: Max Hesse, 1924-1933. Reprint, Tutzing: Hans Schneider, 1966): 145, > quoted and translated by Stephen McClatchie, Analyzing Wagners Operas: > Alfred Lorenz and German Nationalist Ideology (Rochester: University of > Rochester Press, 1998): 130-131 Lorenz argues that this short-short-long structuring principle occurring at multiple scales at once gives Wagner's music its feeling of ever-present forward momentum.

Composition and recording The song was composed in the key of C-sharp minor, and is played in common time. News stories from the Toronto-based newspaper The Globe and Mail inspired the song's lyrics. Drummer and lyricist Neil Peart said of the song: > This was probably the hardest song I ever worked on, in spite of the > pleasure it gave me.

Lee said in an interview: \\"There are a couple of tracks on the last few records where just before the fade-out, I try to put my two cents in (laughs). I did that on 'Red Lenses'.

They also praised the drumming in the song, and thought \\"Red Lenses\\" was reminiscent of the Irish rock band U2. Christopher Thelen of The Daily Vault wrote that the song \\"adds a dimension of funk to Rush\\", and that Geddy Lee's bass work is perfectly suited to the genre. Ultimate Classic Rock ranked the song number 75 on their list of \\"All 167 Rush Songs Ranked Worst to Best\\" and wrote: \\"This one's a mixed bag, with Lee throwing down on some campy synth- horns that probably made Lifeson ‚Äì and a lot of Rush fans ‚Äì furious.

It incorporates specialized and individualized abbreviations, notations, and symbols that allow debaters to keep up with the rapid speed of delivery in most speeches while making a record of as much as possible. Some examples of these abbreviations used on a flow are \\"DA\\" for a disadvantage and \\"K\\" for a kritik (critique). Utilization and restrictions Judge flowing a debate Flowing can be done on paper or on a laptop using a generic spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. Debaters have utilized more specialized software or integrative programs that work in tandem with Microsoft Office. These programs have been usually designed by debaters and former debaters for flowing. In collegiate debate, computers may be used in any round, however some high school tournaments and organizations do not allow their use. Those tournaments that follow the National Forensic League regulations may or may not allow laptops depending on the district. Debaters often prefer to use legal paper to be able to capture the numerous arguments read on each position. Numerous sheets of paper (or tabs in a spreadsheet) are used each round as debaters normally use one sheet for each different type of argument read. Debaters often save flows from previous rounds to keep records of both affirmative cases and strategies used by opponents. Flow-filling After the 1NC and 2AC, the second negative speaker and the first affirmative speaker will fill in missing flow, or do a \\"backflow\\", of their partner who has just given a speech. This can often be accomplished during the cross-examination or the prep time preceding the next speech. The 1NC requires flow filling because they need to flow what issues they are going to argue ('take') in the 1NR and the 2AC needs flow filling because they need a flow of these arguments so that they can carry the argument to the end of the round ('extend') during the 2AR. The 1AC is not backflowed because most affirmative debaters are presumably already familiar with the arguments or they have flowed the arguments before or during the speech. The negative block is not flow filled because the 1NR is prepping during the 2NC and the 1NR has no further speeches. The rest of the rebuttals are not backflowed for the same reason.

There are various opinions as to the origins of the name. The most likely is the Gaelic b√†rr meaning 'a hill-top, a height'. It is believed to have been established in the 17th century by smugglers who needed a safe place close to the secluded bays of the Ayrshire coast while having access to the Raiders Road which runs close by. Barr has not changed much since that time. Currently Barr Village has a population of approximately 110, while the total for the Parish of Barr is in the region of 260. Location The village is situated in the Stinchar Valley where the River Stinchar meets the Water of Gregg. The meeting point of these two watercourses is known locally as The Pot. Local residents and visitors often picnic on the banks of the Stinchar. The village can be accessed from three directions. Each enters the village along a single track road with passing places. The main route is known locally as The Screws because of the twisting nature of the road. The Screws pass through the Hadyard Hill Wind Farm which was established by Scottish and Southern Electricity. Visitors can walk along the service routes and read about the wind farm at the information point in the car park. =Natural features= Barr has many naturally occurring features and a wealth of wildlife. It is popular with many people who enjoy the peace and quiet of the village and surrounds. There are several signed walksBarr Village Paths, Ayrshire Paths website. Last accessed 16 August 2010. in the area, many of which pass through Forestry Commission land, although there are many which follow farm settings. =Buildings= The parish has a strong Covenanters history with several being laid to rest in the village cemetery. The village has a beautiful church which is open at all times. In addition, Kirk Angus lies at the heart of the village. Although the main building of the church has been converted into private residence, the clock tower was donated to the people of Barr. At present options are being investigated for ways to utilise this valuable and historic resource for the community. Language According to a reference in The Carrick Covenanters by James Crichton, the last place in the Scottish Lowlands where Gaelic was spoken was the village of Barr on the River Stinchar in Ayrshire. Barr was once regarded as one of the most isolated places in that part of Scotland, though situated only a few miles from Girvan as the crow flies. Crichton gives neither date nor details.For further discussion on the subject of Gaelic in the South of Scotland, see articles \\"G√†idhlig Ghallghallaibh agus Alba-a-Deas\\" (\\"Gaelic of Galloway and Southern Scotland\\") and \\"G√†idhlig ann an Siorramachd Inbhir-√Äir\\" (\\"Gaelic in Ayrshire\\") by Garbhan MacAoidh, published in the literary magazine Gairm, Numbers 101 and 106.

Basic Impact Calculus There are several basic types of impact calculus that compare the impacts of the plan to the impacts of a disadvantage: ; Substantiality (one impact is more realistic than the other) :e.g. Economic collapse is more seriously realistic than an outbreak of grey goo, therefore the risk of economic collapse outweighs the probability of a grey goo disaster. Probability is rarely discoverable in a debate, so it is not even mentioned in academic debate. Probability has to have some substantiated historical evidence beyond theory to move to precedence or initial risk already incurred. ; Timeframe (one impact will happen sooner) :e.g. An asteroid impact will cause extinction before Global warming will, therefore an asteroid impact outweighs Global Warming. ; Magnitude (one impact is bigger) :e.g. Nuclear war could kill more people instantly than car accidents cumulatively over a long period. ; Severity (one impact is more causal) :e.g. Air pollution increasing illnesses matter more than a loss in a country's GDP because each sickness is more harmful than each loss of money. Because money is intrinsically derived from productivity that maintains or improves health, productivity is inherently much less during illnesses Other types of impact calculus Some other more sophisticated arguments are also considered impact calculus: ; Impact inclusivity (one impact is inclusive of the other) :e.g. Global war is inclusive of a Taiwan war, therefore global war outweighs Taiwan war. ; Root Cause (one impact causes the other impact to happen) :e.g. War causes genocide, therefore war outweighs genocide ; Internal link shortcircuiting (one impact prevents a (positive) impact from happening) :e.g. Nuclear war halts space colonization, therefore nuclear war outweighs space colonization ; Reversibility :e.g. Civil liberties lost in the name of security during a time of crisis can be restored later, but deaths caused by a lack of security are irreversible. ; Link Strength :e.g. Improbable double-dip recessions may be caused by enacting trade sanctions, but more solid arguments with better evidence should be considered more strongly. (This may be considered a type of Substantiability argument, where more firmly-established nontheoretic effects are more important.) Approach arguments can also be considered impact calculus. Arguments as to why the judge should adopt a utilitarian or consequentialist perspective or conversely a deontological perspective may change the way they compare impacts. Impact calculus and \\"new\\" arguments Basic impact calculus arguments may be made at any time and are generally not considered \\"new\\" arguments, even if brought up for the first time in the 2NR or 2AR. More sophisticated forms of impact calculus should generally be brought up earlier in the debate and supported by evidence whenever possible.

It grows in California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora, and Baja California, and was an important food for Native Americans. Some native names include pashiiy from Tongva and it'epe≈° from Venture√±o. Description The inflorescence usually consists of one or two clusters. Bracts are about , more or less round and tipped with an awn (bristle). Salvia columbariae grows tall. Its stem hairs are generally short and sparse in distribution. It has oblong-ovate basal leaves that are long. The leaves are pinnately dissected and the lobes are irregularly rounded. The inflorescence is more or less scapose, meaning it has a long peduncle that comes from the ground level that has bracts. The bracts are round and awn-tipped. There are usually 1‚Äì2 cluster of flowers within the inflorescence. The calyx is long and the upper lip is unlobed but has 2 (sometimes 3) awns. The lower lip is about twice the size of the upper lip. The flower color can be pale blue to blue and purple tipped. The stamens of the plant are slightly exserted. The fruit of S. columbariae is a nutlet that is tan to grey in color and long.

Habitat Salvia columbariae can be found in dry undisturbed sites, chaparral, and coastal sage scrub. It generally grows at elevations lower than . In cultivation, it prefers good drainage, sun, and dry weather. Uses =Medicinal uses= The Cahuilla used the columbariae Benth. variety as a disinfectant by grinding the seeds to mush and applying it to infections as a poultice. The Cahuilla, Ohlone, Kawaiisu, and Mahuna used the gelatinous seeds to cleanse out foreign matter in the eyes. The seeds were placed in the eyes for infections and inflammation, and during sleep, they were tucked underneath the eyelids to remove sand particles. The Ohlone also used it to reduce fevers by consuming the seeds, and the Diegueno chewed the seeds on journeys by foot to give strength. =Food= The Cahuilla, Kawaiisu, Mohave, Tohono O'odham, Chumash and Akimel O'odham grind the seeds and mixed it into water to make a thick beverage. The Cahuillas removed the alkali salts in the water, improving the flavor. They also dry the seeds to make cakes or mush. The Ohlones, Mohave, and Pomo make pinole. The Diegueno added the seeds to wheat to improve flavor. The Mahuna, Paiute, and Akimel O'odham make it into a gelatinous material, then cook it into porridge. The Luiseno, Tubatulabal, and Yavapai used it extensively as a food source. =Building material= The Mahuna made it into a fiber and covered their dwellings.

This layout is worked into many styles of houses, including single-family houses, duplexes and other multifamily structures. Architectural features Such design is typically employed in the United States and Canada to make a dwelling affordable for a family of modest income by combining a narrow lot (sometimes as small as 35 feet (10.6 metres) in width) with a minimum 5 feet setback from each side line, which results in a 25 foot (7.5 metre) wide house. When a two car garage is added, typically of up to 20 feet (6 metres) or better in width, with no back of lot access, the garage dominates the frontage. This design can be contrasted with older developments in which a single detached garage is placed at the back corner of the lot, typically added on after the original construction, and which is built with zero lot line clearance and is accessible since the house is not centered on the lot, but rather offset to one side. Such layouts do not meet setback standards contained in many zoning codes, however. One means to address this is to place an attached single car garage, set back from the house frontage, on one side, perhaps with zero lot line clearance which requires more fire resistant construction and special development permitting.

Eagle Raceway is a one-third mile dirt track located two miles (3 km) east of Eagle, Nebraska on U.S. Highway 34 in Cass County, Nebraska, often referred to by some as the \\"World's Fastest Third Mile\\" because of its speed. The track is located approximately fifteen miles east of Lincoln, Nebraska. As of 2006, the World of Outlaws Sprint Series races at the track once a year, in June. A regular weekly show at the track (Saturday nights from April to September) generally consists of winged sprint cars and IMCA Modifieds in 2006, IMCA-Sanctioned Hobby Stocks and 4-Cylinder Sport Compacts were added to the weekly program.  Track History  In 1963, Eagle, Nebraska, residents Dale Halvorsen and Harvey Kropp constructed the racetrack out of farm ground owned by Halvorsen. Kropp served as promoter of the races. The unique terrain allowed for a high-banked bowl-shaped racetrack to be carved out of surrounding hills. The hills provided an easy location for above-track grandstands. Kropp and Halvorsen promoted primarily open wheel racing events throughout the 1960s and 1970s, ending their promotion of racing after an abbreviated 1976 season in which the only death at the speedway occurred after Jim Golden flipped in turn one after releasing his seatbelts shortly after winning his preliminary heat race. The track remained dormant until 1978 when Paul Saenz leased the track from Halvorsen and raced Late Model Stock Cars weekly. In 1984, the track was purchased by John Beecham, his wife Laura and John's brother Marty. The World of Outlaws were brought to the track for a June show, a relationship that continues to this day. The Beechams began a major renovation project, razing the decaying original scorer's tower and concession stands and constructing a new, two level concession stand and scorer's / VIP area. The old seats were replaced with seating for approximately 5000 fans. The race program consisted of a Friday night winged sprint cars program and a Saturday night NASCAR-sanctioned weekly stock car program. For the 1985 season, the days of the stock car and sprint car program were reversed and IMCA Modifieds were added to the Sprint Car show on Saturdays. The 1987 season saw the introduction of the USAC Midget Series in the Midsummer Midget Classic, which brought future NASCAR Sprint Cup stars to the track. Winners of the annual race include Jeff Gordon (1990) and Tony Stewart (1994). In 1997, the Beecham Family sold the track to Craig Cormack and racing partner Dean Orth operating as Eagle Entertainment, LLC. Cormack took full control of the racetrack in 1999 and continued the weekly program with stock cars on Friday and Sprint Cars & Modifieds on Saturday. As part of the new ownership, the wooden bleachers were replaced with concrete and aluminum stadium seating, with an additional two sections of seats were added in 2000 including a high section of aluminum grandstand and a smaller section of 750-seat wood bleachers, increasing the seating capacity to 7500. The track focused on the entertainment model put forth by such groups as World Wrestling Entertainment, emphasizing activity in the stands as well as the track, and a 100,000-watt sound system was added in 1997. Notable was the inclusion of track announcer Rick Allen Schwieger, who is the current NBC Sports motorsport play-by-play announcer (he does not use his surname on stage). In 2001, blaming poor attendance and participation by race teams, Cormack ended the Friday night stock car program. After the 2005 season, again citing poor attendance, increased criticism on Internet Forums and lack of profit during his ownership, Cormack closed the racetrack and put it up for sale. Former Late Model driver Roger Hadan entered a lease agreement with Cormack to operate the racetrack in 2006, and continued the relationship through 2007. Hadan added IMCA Hobby Stocks and Sport Compacts to the Saturday Night program. Hadan also gained notoriety for promotion of school bus races and other novelty acts for fans. In 2007 he added a JumboTron.

He raised funds for new colleges and founded numerous congregations and churches in areas of new western settlement in Tennessee and Kentucky. Early life and education Blackburn was born in Augusta County, Virginia, of Scots-Irish descent. After being orphaned at the age of eleven, he moved to eastern Tennessee in 1787 to live with relatives. He worked at a sawmill and as a surveyor to obtain an education. As a youth he studied at Martin Academy in Washington County, Tennessee. In 1792 he received his preacher's license and two years later was ordained by the Abingdon Presbytery of Virginia.Gideon Blackburn, Centre College President, 1827 - 1830, Centre College website Career In the 1790s Blackburn began his ministerial career as pastor at the New Providence Church, which he founded in Maryville, Tennessee. He had established a farm and distillery near Fort Craig, Tennessee. For the next two decades he mostly worked with congregations in Maryville, including Eusebia Presbyterian Church. He was known as a powerful and evangelizing public speaker. In the early 19th century, he raised funds to establish schools for Cherokee children. He became a cultural missionary (1803‚Äì1809) to the Cherokee. Receiving permission from them, he founded two schools for Cherokee boys in southeast Tennessee‚Äîone in 1804 on the Hiwassee River near Charleston, Bradley County, which future Cherokee Chief John Ross attended; and in 1806 one at the mouth of Sale Creek, Hamilton County. Blackburn had all classes in English, with material on culture and practices of Anglo-American society. Together the schools had an enrollment of about 100 students, mostly bicultural Cherokee-American boys, often sons of traders, who found the English lessons more useful. Blackburn closed both schools in 1809 or 1810 after his reputation was severely damaged due to a scandal related to alcohol. Some Creeks accused Blackburn, his brother Samuel, and the Cherokee chiefs John McIntosh and Major Ridge of scheming to ship whiskey illegally through Creek territory.Gideon Blackburn in the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture The Native American nations wanted to control the movement of whiskey and other liquor. Moving to Middle Tennessee, a flourishing and fertile area being rapidly settled by migrants, Blackburn served as an itinerant preacher in Franklin, Tennessee, where he headed Harpeth Academy in 1811-13. He founded five congregations in the area, including First Presbyterian Church of Nashville, Tennessee and in 1818 the first Presbyterian church in the Alabama Territory, at Huntsville. Blackburn was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He then moved his family to Louisville, Kentucky, where he was pastor of the First Church of Louisville (1823‚Äì27). He served as president and fundraiser for the young Centre College (1827‚Äì30). He then served again as a minister, at Versailles, Kentucky (1830‚Äì33). During these years he also was active with the Kentucky Temperance Society. Because of his success as a fundraiser, in 1833 Blackburn was invited to Carlinville, Illinois, where he helped raise funds for the new Illinois College. He also started work on developing a non-denominational seminary in Macoupin County. In addition he founded two more congregations. Four days short of his 66th birthday, he died there. The Panic of 1837 had delayed fundraising for the new school he was trying to establish in Carlinville. What was named Blackburn Seminary in his honor was opened in 1859. Marriage and family In 1793 Blackburn married a niece, Grizzel Blackburn, with whom he had seven daughters and four sons. Legacy and honors Blackburn established numerous new congregations and churches in Tennessee and Kentucky.

Powell remained uncredited until Eisner and Cuidera, in a 1999 panel, discussed his contribution. Eisner in 2005 recalled his studio as \\"a friendly shop, and I guess I was the same age as the youngest guys there. We all got along. The only ones who ever got into a hassle were George Tuska and Bob Powell. Powell was kind of a wiseguy and made remarks about other people in the shop. One day, George had enough of it, got up, and punched out Bob Powell\\". Eisner on another occasion said his partnership with Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold created tensions when Arnold wanted to hire Powell separately: Artist Nick Cardy, a colleague at the Eisner studio, said Powell \\"came in later when I was doing [the 'Spirit Section' feature] 'Lady Luck'. He was sitting behind me. He would help a kid around the block ‚Äî tell a newcomer to take it easy and that sort of thing\\". Powell became particularly known for his \\"good girl art\\" in Magazine Enterprises' Cave Girl, and in Fiction House's Jungle Comics, where he worked on early Sheena stories and later on the zebra- bikini'd jungle adventuress Camilla. In the realm of superhero comics, Powell co-created the patriotic character personifying the Spirit of '76, in Harvey's Pocket Comics #1 (Aug. 1941). It would become a long-running feature in Harvey's Green Hornet Comics. Powell also penciled a Golden Age Captain America story, \\"The Sorcerer's Sinister Secret\\", in Timely's All Winners Comics #4 (Spring 1942), and pencilled a chapter of the historic All Winners Comics #19 (Fall 1946).

Howard Nostrand, who joined as one of Powell's assistants in 1948, recalled working alongside fellow assistants \\"George Siefringer, who [drew] backgrounds [and] Martin Epp, who inked, lettered and helped George on backgrounds.

In 1961, Powell became art director for the satirical magazine Sick, working there until his death. On a freelance basis, he worked on Topps' 1962 Mars Attacks trading cards, doing the final pencil art based on early pencils roughs by Wally Wood; Norman Saunders then did the final painted art. Powell had previously worked with Saunders and others on Topps' 1961 Civil War News series of cards. During this 1960s period that fans and historians call the Silver Age of comic books, Powell also drew a handful of stories for Marvel Comics featuring the superheroes Daredevil, Giant-Man, the Hulk and the Human Torch. As commentator and columnist Fred Hembeck described Powell's brief tenure at Marvel, In comic strips, Powell drew writer Bessie Little's short- lived Teena-a-Go-Go (1966) and the similarly short-lived Bat Masterson strip (1959‚Äì1960).

The game consists of four 20-level episodes, the first episode being shareware, the rest being commercial software. It is similar to the games Arctic Adventure and Pharaoh's Tomb (developed by George Broussard and also published by Apogee) but uses an unrelated engine. The game was discontinued, and was released as freeware on March 20, 2009. The game was re-released in 2015 on Steam with support for Windows and macOS. Plot The player is tasked with rescuing NASA astronauts that have gone missing in the fictional \\"monuments of Mars\\". Toward the end of each episode, groups of captured astronauts can be released from \\"energy rings\\". At the end of the final episode, markings on a \\"face\\" object reveal that some aliens were using Mars as a base to study humans from afar, but abandoned it and left their automatic intruder capture system switched on, hence the capture of the astronauts. Gameplay In the game, the player controls an astronaut who must navigate through twenty levels on the planet Mars to finish the game. Most levels require the player to enter a door to advance to the next level, but earlier levels have the player simply move to the opposite side of the screen. The player has the capability to jump and shoot with a gun. This is useful to operate switches which open doors or turn off obstacles. A unique point to this game is that the player has no limit of lives. A player may restart a level as many times as necessary. If a player can collect the letters in the word \\"MARS\\" scattered throughout the level in order, a large bonus is added to the player's score. The game advertises cheat sheets available on registration. The game's save files are quite simple: mars1.sv1 through mars4.sv1 each contain two bytes, representing the number of completed levels and the number of remaining shots, and mars1.sv2 through mars4.sv2 contain the current score as an ASCII integer. A cheating player can therefore set these values to anything they like before restoring a saved game.

The film was renamed The Curve after its Sundance premiere to avoid confusion with the film Dead Man on Campus, a comedy with a similar pass by catastrophe premise about two college roommates who try to get another roommate to commit suicide which was released the same year. In the UK and Australia, however, the film was released as Dead Man's Curve.  Soundtrack  Prior to the start of filming, writer/director Dan Rosen and score composer Shark made a mixtape of songs they were considering for use in the film, which Rosen gave to the principal actors in The Curve to establish the film's tone. When editor Glenn Garland put together the first edit of the film, he used music from this mix tape as \\"temp music,\\" and many of the songs ended up in the final film. A song-based soundtrack album featuring songs from The Curve was released in Japan through Toho Records and in North America through Chromatic Records. The North American album featured 14 tracks composed by Shark, an aria from the 1892 opera La Wally and the songs \\"Die\\" by Starbelly, \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" by Bauhaus and \\"Wake Up Sad (remix)\\" by Wild Colonials.

He started his career as an advisor to Sima Shi and Sima Zhao, the regents of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms era, and subsequently served as an official in the court of Sima Zhao's son, Sima Yan (Emperor Wu), after the establishment of the Jin dynasty. Early life and career in Cao Wei Jia Chong's father, Jia Kui, was a military general in Wei and was considered an epitome of faithfulness to the state. He did not have a son until late in his life; when Jia Chong was born, he was very pleased. Jia Chong's mother was Lady Liu (Êü≥Ê∞è). Jia Chong inherited his father's marquis title after the latter's death. He later served under the regent Sima Shi, and then under Sima Shi's younger brother and successor, Sima Zhao. In 257, Sima Zhao sent him to probe the general Zhuge Dan's intentions should he decided to usurp the Wei throne. Zhuge Dan rebuked Jia Chong when the latter incessantly praised Sima Zhao in front of him. After Jia Chong returned to the capital Luoyang, he warned Sima Zhao that Zhuge Dan would most likely be unwilling to submit to his regency. Sima Zhao therefore summoned Zhuge Dan back to the capital, forcing him to start a rebellion that was quickly crushed. After the incident, Jia Chong became even more highly regarded by Sima Zhao. In 260, the Wei emperor Cao Mao, unable to contain his anger about Sima Zhao's monopolisation of power, attempted a coup d'√©tat to try to take back power from the regent. When forces led by Sima Zhao's brother Sima Zhou quickly collapsed against Cao Mao's forces, it was Jia Chong who was willing to stand against the emperor and who further ordered his subordinate, Cheng Ji (ÊàêÊøü), to take any measure to defeat the emperor and his loyalists. Cheng Ji killed Cao Mao by spearing him to death. In the aftermath of the incident, the people demanded for Cheng Ji and Jia Chong to be executed. Sima Zhao considered the matter for more than 10 days, eventually resolving to kill Cheng Ji (and his clan) but sparing Jia Chong, not wanting to execute someone who had been so loyal to him. From that point on, however, Jia Chong's reputation among the people was one of regicide. Jia Chong also played a key role in Sima Zhao's suppression of Zhong Hui's rebellion in 264. Before the rebellion, Sima Zhao had foreseen that Zhong Hui was likely to rebel against Wei and had made preparations beforehand, including putting Jia Chong in charge of an army to counter any possible attack from Zhong Hui. Zhong Hui was killed by his soldiers who, unwilling to join his rebellion, mutinied against him. Career under the Jin dynasty After Sima Zhao's death in September 265, his son Sima Yan forced the last Wei emperor Cao Huan to abdicate the throne to him in February 266, thus ending Wei's existence and replacing it with the Jin dynasty; Sima Yan himself ascended the throne as Emperor Wu of Jin. Jia Chong, as a loyal subject of the Sima family, continued to be an important figure in the Jin government. Emperor Wu commissioned him to draft the laws of the Jin dynasty, initially considered to be far more merciful than the strict laws under the Wei regime. However, uneven enforcement of these laws meant that the main beneficiaries were nobles. The emperor also enfeoffed Jia Chong as the \\"Duke of Lu\\". For years, Jia Chong had engaged his political rivalry with Ren Kai (‰ªªÊÑ∑) and Yu Chun (Â∫æÁ¥î). In 271, Ren Kai and Yu Chun were able to persuade Emperor Wu to send Jia Chong to lead Jin forces to attack Xianbei rebels led by Tufa Shujineng (Á¶øÈ´ÆÊ®πÊ©üËÉΩ). Jia Chong did not want to fight the rebels at all. He was able to avoid being sent into battle by getting his wife to flatter and convince Emperor Wu's wife, Empress Yang, to recommend his daughter, Jia Nanfeng, to marry Emperor Wu's developmentally disabled crown prince, Sima Zhong. In 272, Jia Chong retaliated against Ren Kai and Yu Chun and succeeded in forcing them out of politics. In 279, Emperor Wu wanted to launch a major invasion against Eastern Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, as part of his grand plan to reunify China under the Jin dynasty. Jia Chong opposed the emperor's idea and argued that Wu was too difficult to conquer. Emperor Wu not only ignored his advice, but also appointed him as the coordinator of a six- pronged attack on Wu. When Jia Chong declined, Emperor Wu told him to coordinate anyway, or else the emperor himself would personally coordinate. Jia Chong relented, but continued to oppose military action. In early 280, despite some military successes against Wu, Jia Chong continued to press for the invasion to be stopped after Jin forces had conquered the western half of Wu. Soon after he wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu arguing against the campaign, the Wu emperor Sun Hao surrendered to the Jin dynasty, thus ending Wu's existence. Jia Chong felt so ashamed that he offered to resign. However, Emperor Wu did not accept the resignation and even rewarded him for what he perceived to be Jia's contributions during the campaign. Death When Jia Chong became critically ill in 282, Emperor Wu bestowed upon him a special honour by ordering the crown prince Sima Zhong to pay a special visit to Jia. After Jia Chong died, his second wife Guo Huai (ÈÉ≠Êßê) wanted Jia Chong's maternal grandson, Han Mi (ÈüìË¨ê), to inherit his ducal title. Emperor Wu approved, even though it was considered inappropriate for a maternal grandson to inherit his maternal grandfather's title. Because of this, the official Qin Xiu (Áß¶ÁßÄ), who was responsible for selecting important officials' posthumous names, initially wanted to select \\"Huang\\" (Ëçí; literally \\"performer of illegal acts\\") as Jia's posthumous name, but Emperor Wu overrode Qin Xiu's recommendation and chose \\"Wu\\" (Ê≠¶; literally \\"martial\\") as Jia's posthumous name. Family Jia Chong had a younger brother, Jia Hun (Ë≥àÊ∑∑), who held the title \\"Marquis of Yongping\\" (Ê∞∏Âπ≥‰æØ). Jia Hun had three sons, Jia Yi (Ë≥àÂΩù), Jia Zun (Ë≥àÈÅµ) and Jia Mo (Ë≥àÊ®°), who served as officials under the Jin dynasty. Jia Chong's first wife, Li Wan (ÊùéÂ©â), was a daughter of Li Feng, who was executed by Sima Shi in 254 for allegedly conspiring with the Wei emperor Cao Fang to unseat Sima Shi from power. At the point in time, Li Wan had already bore Jia Chong two daughters: Jia Bao (Ë≥àË§í) and Jia Yu (Ë≥àË£ï). As Jia Chong wanted to pledge his loyalty to Sima Shi, he divorced Li Wan, who was sent into exile. Jia Chong then married Guo Huai (ÈÉ≠Êßê), a niece of the Wei general Guo Huai (ÈÉ≠Ê∑Æ). Guo Huai bore Jia Chong two daughters as well: Jia Nanfeng and Jia Wu (Ë≥àÂçà). She also bore him a son, Jia Limin (Ë≥àÈªéÊ∞ë), but her unusual jealousy and cruelty doomed her son. One day, when Jia Limin was still a toddler, Jia Chong returned home and caressed his son, who was being carried by his wet nurse. Guo Huai saw this and misinterpreted it as her husband having an affair with the wet nurse, so she killed the wet nurse. Jia Limin was so distressed by his wet nurse's death that he fell sick and died. Guo Huai bore Jia Chong another (unnamed) son later, but the entire tragedy repeated itself when Guo Huai suspected her son's wet nurse of having an affair with her husband. Jia Chong had no son left to succeed him when he died. Among Jia Chong's daughters, Jia Nanfeng married Emperor Wu's crown prince Sima Zhong and eventually became empress after Sima Zhong was enthroned as Emperor Hui. Jia Bao, one of Jia Chong's daughters born to his first wife, married Emperor Wu's younger brother, Sima You (the Prince of Qi). At one point, when Emperor Wu was ill, Sima You was touted as a possible candidate to be the next emperor if Emperor Wu died ‚Äì instead of Emperor Wu's developmentally disabled son Sima Zhong. One official, Xiahou He, tried to persuade Jia Chong to support Sima You and pointed out that both the crown prince and Sima You were Jia's sons-in-law. However, Jia Chong declined to express support for Sima You. Another of Jia Chong's daughters born to Guo Huai, Jia Wu, married Han Shou (ÈüìÂ£Ω), and had a son, Han Mi (ÈüìË¨ê). Han Mi inherited his maternal grandfather's ducal title. In 266, when Emperor Wu ended the Cao Wei state and established the Jin dynasty, he declared a general amnesty for political prisoners under the former regime. Jia Chong's first wife, Li Wan, was thus allowed to return from exile. As Emperor Wu believed that Jia Chong wanted to have his first wife back, he offered to approve of Jia Chong having two formal spouses (both Li Wan and Guo Huai). However, Jia Chong never accepted Li Wan again despite pleas from his two daughters born to Li Wan. Instead, he had a separate residence built for Li Wan but never visited her. Guo Huai, who was jealous of Li Wan, secretly sent spies to carry out surveillance at Li Wan's house for any signs of visit from Jia Chong. Guo Huai herself then went to visit Li Wan once with the intention of humiliating her, but she ended up being humiliated herself when she tripped and landed at Li Wan's feet; she never visited Li Wan again. After Li Wan's death, Jia Nanfeng, who had become Emperor Hui's empress by then, did not allow Li Wan to be buried with Jia Chong. Li Wan was only interred together with Jia Chong in 300 CE after Jia Nanfeng was deposed from her position as empress. In popular culture Jia Chong is first introduced as a playable character in the eighth installment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series.

(The closest LDS Church temple, the Cardston Alberta Temple, is located 60 kilometres (37 mi) southwest in Cardston.) Raymond also has Baptist, Mennonite, and United Church of Canada congregations. Until its temple was relocated to Lethbridge in 2006, the Raymond Buddhist Church was the oldest continually used Buddhist sanctuary in Canada.Alberta Register of Historic Places: Raymond Buddhist Church. = Charitable giving = Statistics Canada has reported that Raymond ranks among the top five communities in Canada for the highest level of charitable donations per capita, which is partially due to the town population's high rate of tithes given to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Attractions  In 1902, one year after it was founded, Raymond held an outdoor rodeo and called it a stampede; this was Canada's first organized rodeo event. Since the inaugural event, the Raymond Stampede has been held annually. It is currently held in conjunction with Raymond's Heritage Days celebration between June 30 and July 1 every summer. Raymond Heritage Days are held annually during the first week of July to celebrate the founding of Raymond. Events and activities include family softball, fireworks, midnight golfing, a fair, a pancake breakfast, a parade and the Raymond Stampede.

He was one of the progenitors of the Bakersfield sound. Although not a huge chart success, he was an inspiration to such greats as Buck Owens, Merle Haggard and Nick Lowe. Biography =Early life and rise to fame= Stewart in 1970 Wynn Stewart was born in Morrisville, Missouri, United States, in 1934, during the Depression. He spent most of his childhood moving around the country with his sharecropping family. After World War II, Stewart spent a year working at KWTO in Springfield, Missouri. In 1948, he moved to California with his family. Stewart originally wanted to become a professional baseball player, but suffered from a hand disease and was also too short to play professional baseball. In high school, Stewart formed a band that played at clubs around California. He soon met steel guitarist Ralph Mooney, who joined Stewart's band. The group's lineup consisted of guitarist Roy Nichols and bassist Bobby Austin. In 1954, Stewart signed a recording contract with an independent record label called Intro Records. He released two singles on Intro. The first was called \\"I've Waited a Lifetime\\" and the second was \\"Strolling\\". Both failed to reach on the country music chart. His second single caught the attention of Skeets McDonald, one of Stewart's idols. He liked the song so much, he arranged an audition with Capitol Records for Stewart. By the summer of 1956, Stewart signed with Capitol. He soon recorded and released his first single from the label, \\"Waltz of the Angels\\", that same year. The song went to No. 14 on the country chart, and gave Stewart his first major hit. The song later became a duet hit for George Jones and Margie Singleton. However, Stewart did not stay with Capitol much longer as none of his other singles was gaining much success. His last single for Capitol (until his 1960s return) was called \\"I Wish I Could Stay the Same\\", released in September 1957. = Nightclub owner= Stewart was part owner of a Las Vegas, Nevada, nightclub called Nashville Nevada during the early 1960s. He performed there six nights a week and also hosted his own television show. A young Merle Haggard sat in with the band while Stewart was out of town in 1962. Stewart returned early, was impressed with Haggard's performance, and hired him as his regular bass player. He wrote Haggard's first hit \\"Sing a Sad Song\\". \\"Wynn's sound was what influenced Buck and me both,\\" Haggard has said, \\"and in a strange twist of fate, his band was the heart of the old Frizzell band ‚Äì Roy Nichols was part of the Lefty band, and he went to Wynn Stewart and ran into Ralph Mooney, who played the steel, and they were the basis of the modern West Coast sound.\\" =Height of his career= With the help of songwriter Harlan Howard, Stewart signed with Jackpot Records, a subsidiary label of Challenge Records, in 1958. He recorded a string of singles that were a mix of different styles, ranging from pop to rockabilly. In 1959, he moved to the parent Challenge label and released a single called \\"Wishful Thinking\\". The song proved a breakthrough for Stewart when it reached No. 5 in 1960. Following the song's success, Stewart moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he hosted a local TV show and was part owner of a nightclub, The Nashville Nevada. Stewart continued to have sizable hits, including the Jan Howard duet called \\"Wrong Company\\", and \\"Big, Big Love\\", among others. Stewart moved back to the center of the Bakersfield sound, California, in 1965. He re-signed with Capitol. Cliffie Stone, who was an A & R director with Capitol introduced Wynn to a young arranger-guitarist Bill Aken (Zane Ashton) who would often over-dub unique guitar parts on Wynn's recordings. His first couple of singles for the label proved unsuccessful once again for Stewart, but his fifth single was a different story. \\"It's Such a Pretty World Today\\" was released in 1967 and became the biggest hit of his career. The song went to No. 1 on the country music chart and spent two weeks there. It was also the country music Song of the Year and a Gold record. Its follow-up, \\"Cause I Have You\\", was a Top 10 hit in 1967. Following his singles' success, Stewart recorded more soft, pop-friendly material, which gave Stewart his biggest hits into the 1970s. By 1972, Stewart moved to RCA Records with \\"Paint Me a Rainbow\\" being his biggest hit for the label. He also briefly signed with Atlantic Records in 1974. Over the next three years, Stewart released singles but did not break the country Top 40. In 1975, he signed with Playboy Records and managed a Top 10 hit in 1976 called \\"After The Storm\\". Although he stayed with Playboy, he only had one other big hit, his version of \\"Sing a Sad Song\\", which went to No. 19 in 1977. =Later career and death= Stewart started his own label in 1978 called WIN. His first single, \\"Eyes as Big as Dallas\\", broke the Top 40. Although country music was changing in the late 1970s, moving to the smooth sounds of country pop, he was not able to continue to achieve success, which was hampered by his alcoholism. In the early 1980s, Stewart quit performing, but a few years on and Stewart launched a comeback, with an extensive tour and a new album. During the tour, Stewart suddenly died of a heart attack on July 17, 1985. Following Stewart's death, his song \\"Wait 'Til I Get My Hands on You\\" became a minor hit. Commercials In 2010, Volkswagen used Stewart's song \\"Another Day, Another Dollar\\" in an ad for the Jetta Kmart also used one of Wynn's songs, \\"It's Such a Pretty World Today\\", on a Blue light special commercial.

It is available in most kinds, and consists of an hourglass-shaped body with two heads made from animal skin. The two heads produce sounds of different pitch and timbre, which when played together are believed to represent the harmony of man and woman. Janggu [Ïû•Íµ¨] is one of instruments of Samulnori [ÏÇ¨Î¨ºÎÜÄÏù¥]. Samulnori consists of Janggu, Buk [Î∂Å], Jing [Ïßï] and kkwaenggwari [ÍΩπÍ≥ºÎ¶¨] History The first depiction of the instrument is on a bell belonging to the Silla (57 BC‚Äì935 AD) period and in a mural painting of the same period in Goguryeo (37 BC‚Äì668 AD) tomb. The oldest Korean historical records about an hourglass-shaped drum may be traced to the reign of King Munjong (1047‚Äì1084) of Goryeo as a field instrument. The Goryeo-sa (1451), or History of Goryeo, in chapter 70, records twenty janggu as part of a gift of instruments to be used in royal banquet music from the Song Dynasty Emperor Huizong to the Goryeo Court in Gaeseong in 1114. This book represents the earliest appearance of the word janggu in a Korean source. Later in chapter 80, for the year 1076, the term janggu-opsa (one who plays or teaches the janggu) is used. The janggu may have evolved from the yogo (; literally \\"waist drum\\"), another similar but smaller Korean drum that is still in use today. The yogo is thought to have originated from the idakka, an Indian instrument introduced into Korea from India through China during the Silla (57 BC‚Äì935 AD) period. Evidence of the yogo was depicted on the mural paintings in the tomb of Jipanhyun of Goguryeo, and from the pictures at the Gameun Temple, the Relics of Buddha, made of bronze in the second year of King Mun (682) during the Unified Silla period. It was during the time of Goryeo that the size of the Janggu grew to its present-day standard. Construction It is made from a hollow, hourglass- shaped wooden body of either porcelain, tile, metal, wood, gourd, or tinned sheet. Popular choices are poplar and paulownia woods. However, paulownia is most popular because it is the lightest and the best resonating material, producing beautiful sounds. Jorongmok is the round tube in the middle connecting the left and right side of the hourglass-shaped body. The size of the jorongmok determines the quality of the tone: the wider the tube, the deeper and huskier it sounds; the narrower the tube, the harder and snappier it sounds. The two skin heads are lapped onto metal hoops placed over the open ends of the body and secured by rope counter-loops. The left head (book side) named gungpyeon is covered with a thick cowhide, horsehide, or deerskin to produce deep and low tones. The right side (chae side) named chaepyeon is covered with either dog skin or a lighter horsehide to produces higher tones. There are two kinds of beating sticks (chae), namely gungchae and yeolchae. The gungchae is shaped like a mallet with a round head. The handle is made from bamboo root, boiled and straightened out and the head is made from hardwood such as birch or antler. Modern gungchae may also be made from plastic; this variety is normally used by beginning musicians. The yeolchae is always made from bamboo. Playing A performer playing janggu' Janggu is used throughout traditional Korean instrumental music, such as court music(Í∂ÅÏ§ëÏùåÏïÖ), wind music(ÌíçÎ•òÏùåÏïÖ), folk music(ÎØºÏÜçÏùåÏïÖ) and shamanistic music(Î¨¥ÏÜçÏùåÏïÖ), as well as traditional performing arts divisions such as vocal music and dance and Yeonhui(Ïó∞Ìù¨). Nongak(Pungmul), which only plays percussion instruments, serves to make the rhythms of percussion music colorful by playing finely divided rhythms of the combined notes of several percussion instruments. Traditionally the janggu is played using yeolchae on the right hand high pitch area and uses the bare hand on the low pitch area. Such an example can be seen on pungmul players for a number of folk songs and shamanistic rituals. But today, it is common to see the use of gungchae and yeolchae together. 'Gungchae' is used to play the low pitch side. With yeolchae, you can make the sound 'dda(Îî∞)', and with gungchae sound 'gung(Í∂Å)'. When you use it at the same time, you can make the sound 'dung(Îç©)'. Janggu can be played on the floor such as for traditional sanjo music or carried with a strap on the shoulder. The way performers carry the Janggu differs from person to person, from region to region and varies depending on his or her taste. The janggu is usually classified as an accompanying instrument because of its flexible nature and its agility with complex rhythms. Since the performer can use his or her hands as well as sticks, various sounds and tempi, deep and full, soft and tender, and menacing sounds, and fast and slow beats, can be created to suit the mood of the audience. Using this capability, a dextrous performer can dance along moving his or her shoulders up and down and make the audience become carried away and dance along with him See also *Hourglass drum *Traditional Korean musical instruments *Korean music References *Nathan, Hesselink (2006).P'ungmul: South Korean Drumming and Dance.

It is located on Highway 38, approximately north of Edmonton. Its population was 1,915 in the 2011 census, while the town's municipal census conducted in 2012 counted a population of 2,116.  History  In the early 1900s, the area where Redwater stands was settled first by Ukrainian settlers, and followed by English and French settlers. The name Redwater is a reference to the nearby Redwater River, an ochre-coloured tributary that drains into the North Saskatchewan River. The survey of the Redwater area was registered on September 7, 1906. The original post office, established in 1907 at a location to the east of present-day Redwater, was moved in 1919 to the current town site when Redwater was established as a hamlet. On December 31, 1949 it was incorporated as a village, becoming a town a year later on December 31, 1950. Originally, Redwater was primarily a farming community. The 1948 discovery of oil in the area transformed the hamlet of about 160 people into a town of 1,306 by 1951.  Geography  Redwater is surrounded by wide, flat expanses of some of the best farming soil in Alberta. Some of the major geographical features in the area are the Sturgeon River which travels roughly east-south- east about south of the town and flows into the North Saskatchewan River. To the east and south-east, there are vast areas of sandy soil known locally as sand hills, some of which support a thriving silica sand and gravel industry. These differing zones support two major types of forest; coniferous, including Jack Pine, Scots Pine, White Spruce, Black Spruce, and some Balsam Fir; broadleaf trees including Birch, Poplar and Aspen.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Redwater recorded a population of 2,053 living in 862 of its 946 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 1,915. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. The Town of Redwater's 2012 municipal census counted a population of 2,116. The census also counted 921 total dwellings within the town, 77 more than the 844 counted by Statistics Canada in 2011. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Redwater had a population of 1,915 living in 776 of its 844 total dwellings, a -13% change from its 2006 adjusted population of 2,202. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. At 844, the total amount of dwellings counted by Statistics Canada in 2011 was reportedly 54 less than the 898 it counted in 2006.  Economy  In addition to the farming industry that surrounds the town, numerous large industrial operations are located in the nearby Alberta's Industrial Heartland to the south. The largest industrial operation is the North West Redwater Partnership's (NWRP) Sturgeon Refinery, a crude oil upgrader located near Redwater. The Sturgeon Refinery, also known as the NWR Sturgeon Refinery, built, owned and operated by NWRP, under a multi-year agreement with the Alberta provincial government, which has provided multi-billion dollar loans for the operation as well as a 30-year commitment to supplying the refinery with bitumen feed. On their website, NWRP estimated that the economic value of the Sturgeon Refinery to Alberta is about $CDN90 billion over 30 years\\". Other notable operations include a fertilizer plant Agrium Inc, a chemical production plant Evonik Industries , a petrochemical plant Pembina,http://www.pembina.com/about-us/our-operations/ a pipeline storage and shipping facility Access Pipeline INChttp://www.accesspipeline.com/ and the Shell Scotford upgrader and refinery. These industries have spawned an array of offshoot businesses such as shipping, oilfield services, heavy equipment and other support services.  Attractions  Redwater boasts many attractions for a community of its size such as: A nine-hole golf course with grass greens is located within Redwater, a multi use recreational facility Pembina place,http://www.redwater.ca/visiting/pembina-place/100-living/activities- recreation/pembina-place an outdoor swimming pool, the sand hills natural area which is home to some of the best ATV trails in central Alberta,http://www.albertaparks.ca/redwater.aspx a public library, and the world's largest oil derrick.

Ptolemy‚Äôs view of the region is not very precise, but he places them on the east side of what he believed to be an island, Scandia. The presence of the Goutai, or Goths, in the center, identifies Scandia fairly certainly as the southern portion of the Scandinavian peninsula. As to whether the east of it was the east coast of Sweden or the coast of Finland opposite, the latter is perhaps too remote for detailed knowledge by Ptolemy or his sources. There is in fact a possible Germanic derivation of Phiraisoi. They are in the same region as the Favonae, who may have been residents of Sm√•land. Old Norse and Old Icelandic firar, Old English firas, are fairly close to Firaesi and mean \\"men, human beings\\" or Volk in German. As it happens, Uppland was traditionally divided into Folkland ‚Äì four provinces, which lost their jurisdictional importance in 1296. Koebler's Old Norse Etymological Database in the Indo-European Etymological Database online at Leiden University gives a Proto-Indo-European root of *perkwus, becoming Germanic *ferhwioz by Grimm's Law. The root meaning is \\"oak\\", but the oak was regarded as a symbol of hardness, toughness and strength (see also Harudes). With regard to people it means \\"life force\\" or especially \\"power\\", in the sense of the collective power of the folk. It would be a descriptive epithet of the *teuta-, \\"tribe, people\\". This connotation is probably not devoid of a military sense, as the root went into Hittite, a very early branch of Indo-European, as \\"army\\". Uppland then would have been a densely populated and at the time fairly conservative remnant of Indo-European culture. If the Indo-European penetration of Europe can be regarded as a very slow invasion, its Schwerpunkt, or \\"heavy point\\", came to rest in Uppland. The Firaesi are not mentioned elsewhere in history, perhaps because of language changes and the preference of folk for firar. More information is undoubtedly to be gleaned from archaeology.

It is located on the southeast shore of Lesser Slave Lake, at the junction of Highway 2 and Highway 88, in the Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124. Slave Lake serves as a local centre for the area. The administrative office for the Sawridge First Nation reserve is also located in the town.  History  The first European to visit the area of the present-day Town of Slave Lake was David Thompson who explored the area in 1799. Following his brief visit, several fur trading posts were established around Slave Lake, with a Hudson's Bay Company post established at the mouth of the lake. The first community, called Sawridge, was renamed Slave Lake in 1923. It was wiped out by a flood in the 1930s, and was subsequently moved to its current location. It was incorporated as a town in 1965. The Town of Slave Lake was inundated by a flood of Sawridge Creek in July 1988. = 2011 wildfire = On May 15, 2011, large parts of the town were affected by wildfires in the area. Winds pushed the flames into the town and destroyed many houses and businesses. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued, but with highways being closed, residents were urged to make their way to beaches, large parking lots, and open spaces. Highway 2 had been closed at the outset of the fire, but eventually re-opened for evacuation, with full evacuation ordered for Slave Lake. On May 16, 2011, provincial officials said that 40% of the town had been destroyed or damaged, including the town hall, the library, a radio station, a mall and a significant number of homes and other buildings; no injuries or deaths were reported. On May 17, 2011, Mayor Karina Pillay-Kinnee indicated one-third of the town had been destroyed by the wildfire. On May 20, 2011, a firefighting helicopter crashed into the Lesser Slave Lake near Canyon Creek where its pilot died at the scene. It crashed about off shore into water that was deep. On July 6, Prince William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, visited the town to offer encouragement to residents and support for rebuilding efforts.  Geography  =Climate= Slave Lake experiences a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc) that borders on a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb). Summers tend to be warm with cool nights while winters are long and severely cold.

Daniel da Cruz Carvalho (born 2 November 1976), commonly known as Dani, is a Portuguese retired footballer who played mainly as an attacking midfielder. He spent most of his eight-year professional career with Ajax after starting out at Sporting, appearing in nearly 100 competitive matches and winning three major titles. He also competed abroad in England with West Ham United, and Spain with Atl√©tico Madrid. All youth levels comprised, Dani played 69 times for Portugal and scored 33 goals. He made his full debut in 1995. Club career A skilled attacking player whose career was cut short by poor professional judgment, Dani was born in Lisbon and began his career with local club Sporting CP, making his first-team debut during 1994‚Äì95 aged just 17, in a team which also included Lu√≠s Figo, Ricardo S√° Pinto and Bulgarian Krassimir Balakov, and helped the side to the season's Portuguese Cup. In January 1996, Dani started a small loan in the Premier League with West Ham United, where he scored at Tottenham Hotspur and at home against Manchester City. Despite performing reasonably well during his tenure, his season ended when he was fired by manager Harry Redknapp when he missed training after being spotted in a nightclub. Subsequently, Dani represented AFC Ajax, appearing regularly for the Amsterdam side but almost never as an undisputed starter. He did score an important goal in the 1996‚Äì97 UEFA Champions League quarter-final clash against Atl√©tico Madrid, in a 3‚Äì2 away win (4‚Äì3 aggregate). In December 2000, after a brief spell with S.L. Benfica, Dani signed for Atl√©tico Madrid of the Spanish Segunda Divisi√≥n, teaming up with compatriot Hugo Leal. After the Colchoneros returned to La Liga with him as an important unit, he was pretty much absent for the majority of the 2002‚Äì03 campaign and, after failing to find a new team, definitively retired from football in early 2004 at only 27. International career Dani earned nine caps for Portugal, the first coming on 12 December 1995 in a 1‚Äì1 friendly with England, and the last on 29 March 2000 in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Denmark (also friendly). Previously, he appeared for the nation at the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship in Qatar, being awarded the second place in both the Golden Boot and Golden Ball awards, and also competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics where the team finished fourth. Personal life Still during his playing career, Dani worked regularly as a model. After retiring, he worked in television. Redknapp, when he still acted as assistant manager at West Ham, once said about the player: ‚ÄúDani is so good-looking I don‚Äôt know whether to play him or fuck him.‚Äù Honours =Club= Sporting *Ta√ßa de Portugal: 1994‚Äì95 Ajax *Eredivisie: 1997‚Äì98 *KNVB Cup: 1997‚Äì98, 1998‚Äì99 Atl√©tico Madrid *Segunda Divisi√≥n: 2001‚Äì02 =International= Portugal U-20 *FIFA U-20 World Cup third place: 1995 References External links  Beijen profile National team data 1976 births Living people Sportspeople from Lisbon Portuguese footballers Association football midfielders Primeira Liga players Sporting CP footballers S.L.

Part of Northern Alberta, it is located in the eponymous Swan Hills, north of Whitecourt and northwest of Fort Assiniboine. The town is at the junction of Highway 32 and Grizzly Trail, and is surrounded by Big Lakes County. It is the nearest major settlement to the geographic centre of the province. In 1989, local resident Roy Chimiuk used a minimum bounding box method to place a cairn marking the exact location at , about 30 kilometres south of the town. The site is protected by the Centre of Alberta Natural Area, a 3-kilometre hike from Highway 33.  History  Initially a base camp for workers in the Swan Hills oilfield, accommodations and facilities were moved from a nearby site and jointly developed in the present location by the government of Alberta and oil companies between 1959-1961. Casually nicknamed 'Oil Hills', the town's official name was taken from the area of densely forested uplands in which it is located, although 'Chalmers' was also considered, after T.W. Chalmers, who had surveyed and cut the Klondike Trail through the area. The New Town of Swan Hills was incorporated on September 1, 1959 and R.L. Maxfield was appointed as Development Officer and Secretary Treasurer. Twenty-four parcels of industrial land were sold at the first land auction in November 1959. The first all- weather road into the area was completed in 1960, replacing the treacherous forestry road connecting Swan Hills to Fort Assiniboine; the Swan Hills Post Office was opened the same year. The New Town of Swan Hills was officially opened by Premier Ernest Manning in June 1962. Two teachers provided instruction for forty students in the first two-room school, which was quickly replaced by a seven-room building due to the rapidly increasing population as oil field workers began to relocate their families to the town. Two mobile radio units provided communications and an isolated diesel generating plant provided power until Alberta Government Telephones installed service and Canadian Utilities Ltd. completed an transmission line in 1960. In November 1965, Swan Hills became the most northerly town in Alberta to be served with natural gas by Northwestern Utilities. Swan Hills' status was changed when it was formally incorporated as a town on January 1, 1967 making it the first town incorporated during Canada's centennial year. Tom Parkinson was elected the first mayor, serving in the position until 1971. Situated within dense boreal forest, Swan Hills has been evacuated at least five times as wildfires threatened the town: 1972, 1981 and 1983, and twice in May 1998, when the Virginia Hills Fire, came close. The town has since implemented a FireSmart program, reducing fire fuel within and around the urban perimeter.

It was the result of the conquest of the region in 1406 to 1407. The previous periods of Chinese rules, collectively known as the B·∫Øc thu·ªôc periods in Vietnam, were longer-lasting, constituting much of Vietnam's history from 111 BC to 939 AD. The fourth Chinese occupation of Vietnam was eventually ended with the establishment of the L√™ dynasty. History =Ming invasion of Vietnam= Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) when it was under Ming occupation The former ruling dynasty of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, the Tr·∫ßn, had relations with the Yuan and Ming Empire as a tributary. However, in 1400, H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly (ËÉ°Â≠£Áäõ) deposed and massacred the Tr·∫ßn house before usurping the throne. After taking the throne, H·ªì renamed the country from ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát to ƒê·∫°i Ngu (Â§ßËôû). In 1402, he abdicated the throne in favor of his son, H·ªì H√°n Th∆∞∆°ng (ËÉ°Êº¢Ëíº). In October 1404, Tr·∫ßn Thi√™m B√¨nh (Èô≥Ê∑ªÂπ≥) arrived at the Ming imperial court in Nanjing, claiming to be a Tr·∫ßn prince. He notified the court of the treacherous events that had taken place and appealed to the court for the restoration of his throne. The Yongle Emperor of the Ming Empire issued an edict reprimanding the usurper and demanding the restoration of the Tran throne, a pretext to the annexation of Vietnam. As the party crossed the border into L·∫°ng S∆°n, H·ªì's forces ambushed them and killed the Tr·∫ßn prince that the Ming convoy were escorting back. In the winter of 1406, the Ming armies began their invasion. Zhang Fu and Mu Sheng departed from Guangxi and Yunnan respectively to launch a pincer attack into enemy territory. On 19 November 1406, they captured the two capitals and other important cities in the Red River Delta. H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly and his son were captured on 16 June 1407, they were caged and brought as prisoners to the Yongle Emperor in Nanjing. =Revolt of Tr·∫ßn aristocrats= There was several revolts among the Vietnamese people against the Ming authorities, but they all proved unsuccessful. Among the people who led the rebellion were, Tr·∫ßn Ng·ªói (revolted 1407‚Äì09), a young son of the late Tr·∫ßn emperor Tr·∫ßn Ngh·ªá T√¥ng and Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng, a nephew. These revolts were short-lived and poorly planned but they helped lay some of the groundwork for L√™ L·ª£i's war for independence. =Lam S∆°n uprising= L√™ L·ª£i, one of Vietnam's most celebrated heroes, is credited with rescuing the country from Ming domination in 1428. Born of a wealthy landowning family, he served as a senior scholar-official until the advent of the Ming, whom he refused to serve. The Ming dynasty crushed L√™'s rebellion at first but court debates concluded that Vietnam was an unnecessary distraction and the Ming decided to withdraw their armies from Vietnam, long before the rebels started scoring any victories. When L√™ offered to become a vassal of China, the Ming immediately declared him as ruler of Vietnam.David C. Kang, Dat X. Nguyen, Ronan Tse-min Fu, Meredith Shaw. \\"War, Rebellion, and Intervention under Hierarchy: Vietnam‚ÄìChina Relations, 1365 to 1841.\\" Journal of Conflict Resolution 63.4 (2019): 896-922. online Le Loi then ascended the Vietnamese throne, taking the reign name L√™ Th√°i T·ªï and establishing the L√™ dynasty (1428‚Äì1788). Sinicization An entry in the Ming Shilu (traditional Chinese: ÊòéÂØ¶ÈåÑ; simplified Chinese: ÊòéÂÆûÂΩï) dated 15 August 1406 recorded an imperial order from Emperor Yongle that instructed for Vietnamese records such as maps and registers to be saved and preserved by the Chinese army: > Â∑±Êú™ÊïïÂæÅË®éÂÆâÂçóÁ∏ΩÂÖµÂÆòÊàêÂúãÂÖ¨Êú±ËÉΩÁ≠âÊõ∞Â∏´ÂÖ•ÂÆâÂçó‰∏ãÈÉ°ÈÇëÂá°ÂæóÊñáÁ±çÂúñÂøóÁöÜÂãøÊØÄ„ÄÇ In addition, according to Yueqiaoshu (Chinese: Ë∂äÂ∂†Êõ∏, Vietnamese: Vi·ªát ki·ªáu th∆∞), on August 21, 1406, the Yongle Emperor issued an order to Ming soldiers in Annam: > ÂÖµÂÖ•„ÄÇÈô§ÈáãÈÅìÁ∂ìÊùøÁ∂ìÊñá‰∏çÁá¨„ÄÇÂ§ñ‰∏ÄÂàáÊõ∏ÊùøÊñáÂ≠ó‰ª•Ëá≥‰øö‰øóÁ´•ËíôÊâÄÁøí„ÄÇÂ¶Ç‰∏äÂ§ß‰∫∫‰∏ò‰πôÂ∑≤‰πãÈ°û„ÄÇÁâáÁ¥ôÈöªÂ≠óÊÇâÁöÜÁá¨‰πã„ÄÇÂÖ∂Â¢ÉÂÖß‰∏≠Âúã > ÊâÄÁ´ãÁ¢ëÂàªÂâáÂ≠ò‰πã„ÄÇ‰ΩÜÊòØÂÆâÂçóÊâÄÁ´ãËÄÖÊÇâÂ£û‰πã„ÄÇ‰∏ÄÂ≠ó‰∏çÂ≠ò„ÄÇ \\"Once our army enters Annam, except Buddhist and > Taoist text; all books and notes, including folklore and children book, > should be burnt.

After the annexation of ƒê·∫°i Ngu into Ming territory, the Ming government imposed cultural regulations and enforced Han culture onto the Vietnamese natives. Men were to keep their hair long, as per Confucian teachings, instead of the short hairstyles of previous L√Ω and Tr·∫ßn Dynasties. Women were also prohibited from practicing teeth blackening. Ming administrators said their mission was to civilized the unorthodox Vietnamese barbarians. A royal edict was issued by Vietnam in 1474 forbidding Vietnamese from adopting foreign languages, hairstyles and clothes like that of the Lao, Champa or the \\"Northerners\\" which referred to the Ming. The edict was recorded in the 1479 Complete Chronicle of Dai Viet of Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n. Economy The Ming government began a harsh rule of both colonization and sinicization. Valuable artifacts such as gems, jade, gold, pieces of art as well as craftsmen were transported to China. The Chinese had greatly encouraged the development and the use of gold and silver mines. But right after the silver and gold were extracted they impounded them and sent a fraction of these minerals to Beijing. They also imposed salt taxes, but a slightly heavier tax against those who produced salt in Annam. Military and administration It was instructed that the Ming army should free the prisoners from various countries who were taken captive by so- called Li bandits in Vietnam. To keep the people under control in Vietnam, the Ming government issued, and utilized the \\"So Ho\\" system, (literally meaning Family Book) at the lowest village community level. Whenever there was a change in a family, a change in the book was recorded and approved. Based on this information, they created a systematic military service enrollment process for all young men deemed fit enough to serve in the future for the Imperial Chinese Army. This process was no different than what other governments did to subjugated areas, nonetheless, this had created a negative feeling against the Chinese government. In addition, many talented Vietnamese individuals with varying trades and backgrounds who could make significant contributions were allowed to become government officials in China where they served in the Chinese imperial government. The Ming's ethnic Vietnamese collaborators included Mac Thuy whose grandfather was M·∫°c ƒêƒ©nh Chi who was a direct ancestor of M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung. Vietnam received firearms from Ming dynasty rule over Vietnam.Military Technology Transfers from Ming China and the Emergence of Northern Mainland Southeast Asia (c. 1390-1527) Sun Laichen Journal of Southeast Asian Studies Vol. 34, No. 3 (Oct., 2003), pp. 495‚Äì517 Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of Department of History, National University of Singapore Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20072535 Page Count: 23 The conquest of Champa was enabled when Vietnam's north received gunpowder weapons from the Ming dynasty along with Neo-Confucianist thought.

The return of the Ming Chinese to China was commanded by the Ming and not Le Loi. The Trai made up the supporters of Le Loi in his campaign. He lived among the Trai at the border regions as their leader and seized the Ming ruled lowland Kinh areas after originally forming his base in the southern highland regions. The southern dwelling Trai and Red River dwelling Vietnamese were in effect locked in a \\"civil war\\" during the anti Ming rebellion by Le Loi.

It is located approximately east of Edmonton at the junction of Highway 14, Highway 834, and Highway 626. Beaverhill Lake is located immediately northeast of the community.  History  Before 1865, only Aboriginal people lived in this area, the home of the Cree. Beaverhill Lake (known then as Beaver or Beaver Hills Lake) was full of fish and wildfowl. A variety of wild fruits could be eaten fresh or added to pemmican. Big game animals, including herds of bison, were available for food and clothing. Tofield's Aboriginal legacy is evident in the names of local creeks: Maskawan, Amisk and Ketchamoot. The latter refers to Chief Ketchamoot who came from Ft. Pitt in 1860 to help the local Crees against their traditional Blackfoot enemies. Victorious, he remained in the area, and is buried on the bank of the Ketchamoot Creek. Tofield's first school was organized in 1890 and named McKenzie School in honor of the first postmaster in the area, at the Logan post office. The Tofield Post Office was obtained in 1897, and was located at the south end of Beaverhill Lake. The town of Tofield had its beginning in 1906 when Morton and Adams built a General Store near the Post Office at a site southeast of present-day Tofield. By the spring of 1906 other businesses, including a lumber yard, hardware store, another general store, a drug store, a blacksmith shop and a hotel, had been founded. Very soon after that, the town moved to a site northwest of the old site and north of the present townsite when the Edmonton-based company Crafts and Lee offered free lots that were near the site of the proposed route of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. By fall of 1908 two blocks of businesses were filled and all residential lots were full. Later that year the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway decided on a route south of the second townsite and the town moved again, to its present location. Tofield was proclaimed a village on September 9, 1907 and became a town just two years later in 1909. = Name origin = Tofield is named after the pioneer medical man, Dr. J.H. Tofield, who came to the area in 1893 from England. He was born in Yorkshire and educated in Oxford as a doctor and as an engineer. Tofield arrived in Edmonton in 1882 and served as an army doctor in the Riel Rebellion. The name Tofield was first applied to the school district and in March 1898 to the post office.

After further training in Casco Bay, Maine, she sailed on 11 April for NS Argentia, Newfoundland, her base for weather patrols through the following summer. Operating out of Argentia and later Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, she ranged the North Atlantic from the coastal waters of Greenland to waters north of the Azores, reporting vital meteorological data. Lorain returned to Boston on 14 September, conducted a weather patrol off New England in late October, then sailed on 2 December for duty in the Caribbean.

The 180th is equipped with the C-130H2 Hercules. History =World War II = The squadron was constituted on 19 June 1942 during World War II as the 438th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), and was activated on 26 June at Barksdale Field, assigned to the 319th Bombardment Group, equipped with the Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber. After training with the group under the Third Air Force in Louisiana, it was sent to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations through England, where it was based between September and October. The ground echelon of the squadron landed at Arzew, Algeria during Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, on 8 November. In Algeria, the group became part of the Twelfth Air Force; the squadron was based at Saint-Leu Airfield around 10 November, moving to Tafaraoui Airfield on 17 November, Maison Blanche Airport around 26 November, and Telergma Airport on 13 December. It flew its first combat mission of the North African Campaign on 28 November, engaging in raids on Axis airdromes, harbors, railroads, and shipping off the North African coast among other targets until 13 February 1943. The 438th was withdrawn with the group to French Morocco between 27 February and 31 May for reorganization and re-equiping, being based at Oujda Airfield from 3 March and Rabat‚ÄìSal√© Airport from 25 April. After moving forward to Sedrata Airfield, Algeria, on 1 June, it returned to combat on 6 June, flying missions to reduce Axis strength on Pantelleria and striking targets on Sicily in preparation and in support of the Allied invasion of that island. The 438th was relocated to Djedeida Airfield on 26 June, and after the capture of Sicily in August it flew most of its missions against bridges, airdromes, marshalling yards, viaducts, gun sites, defensive positions, and other targets in Italy, later in support of Operation Avalanche, the Allied landings at Salerno in southwestern Italy. In November, it moved to Sardinia, to strike Axis targets in central Italy. Early in 1944, the squadron supported Allied ground forces as they advanced in the Monte Cassino and Anzio areas. Later in the year, the group attacked German supply lines in northern Italy, bombing bridges, marshalling yards, and roads. During the summer, it bombed bridges over the Po River in northern Italy to block the stream of German supplies and reinforcements going southward. Supported Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France in August 1944 by attacking coastal batteries, radar stations, and bridges. From Corsica, it hit railroad bridges in Northern Italy and late in the year attacked railroad lines through the Brenner Pass that connected Germany and Austria with Italy. In January 1945, the squadron returned to the United States, where it began to train with A-26 aircraft for operations in the Pacific Theater. Between May and July 1945, moved by ship to Okinawa, and on 16 July flew its first mission against Japan. From then until the end of the fighting in early August, the squadron attacked enemy targets such as airfields and industrial centers on Ky≈´sh≈´ and occupied Shanghai area of China, and shipping around the Ryukyu Islands and in the East China Sea. In November and December 1945, the squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated. =Missouri Air National Guard= The wartime 438th Bombardment Squadron was reactivated and redesignated the 180th Bombardment Squadron, and was allotted to the Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Rosecrans Memorial Airport, St Joseph and was extended federal recognition on 22 August 1946. The squadron was equipped with Douglas B-26 Invaders and was assigned to the 66th Fighter Wing at Lambert Field, St Louis. Korean War activation Douglas B-26C, #44-35549 of the 180th Light Bombardment Squadron, Bordeaux-M√©rignac AB, France On 1 April 1951 the 180th was federalized and brought to active duty due to the Korean War. It moved to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. At Langley, the 180th Bombardment Squadron was assigned to the federalized 126th Bombardment Group, equipped with B-26 Invaders. The 126th Group consisted of the 180th, along with the 108th and the 168th Bombardment Squadrons from the Illinois Air National Guard. The aircraft were marked by various color bands on the vertical stabilizer and rudder. Black/Yellow/Blue for the 108th; Black/Yellow/Red for the 168th, and Black/Yellow/Green for the 180th. After training and organization, the 126th Bombardment Wing was reassigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe and deployed to Bordeaux-Merignac Air Base, France with the first elements arriving in November 1951. By 10 November, Bordeaux was considered an operational base and was assigned to the 12th Air Force. It flew B-26's for training and maneuvers and stayed at Bordeaux AB until being transferred Laon- Couvron Air Base, France on 25 May 1952. At Laon, the 126th used its B-26's for training and maneuvers until December until being relieved from active duty and transferred, without personnel and equipment, back to the United States where the unit was returned to the control of the Air National Guard on 1 January 1953. Tactical Air Command Returning to Rosecrans Airport, the 180th was reformed as a light bombardment squadron in January 1953. It received B-26 Invaders that returned from the Korean War and trained primarily in night bombardment missions, which the aircraft specialized in while in Korea. With the removal of the B-26 from bombing duties in 1957 as neared the end of their service lives, the squadron received some Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star jet fighters and some Republic RF-84F Thunderflash reconnaissance aircraft. They were redesignated as the 180th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 1 July 1957, then transferred out the F-80s and were redesignated as the 180th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 10 April 1958 Air Transport On 14 April 1962, the 180th was gained by Military Air Transport Service (MATS), trading in its Thunderflassh jet reconnaissance aircraft for 4-engined Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter transports. With air transportation recognized as a critical wartime need, the unit was redesignated the 180th Air Transport Squadron (Heavy). With the transition to MATS, the 180th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 139th Air Transport Group was established, the 180th becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 139th group headquarters, 139th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 139th Air Base Squadron, and the 139th USAF Dispensary. From St. Joseph, the 180th augmented MATS airlift capability worldwide in support of the Air Force's needs. Throughout the 1960s, the unit flew long-distance transport missions in support of Air Force requirements, frequently sending aircraft to Europe, Alaska, the Caribbean, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, and during the Vietnam War, to South Vietnam, Okinawa and Thailand. With the replacement of MATS by Military Airlift Command, the squadron was redesignated the180th Military Airlift Squadron on 1 January 1966. Air Refueling 180th Air Refueling Squadron Boeing KC-97G Stratofreighter 53-283 refueling 23d TFW A-7D Corsair IIs from England AFB, Louisiana. A-7s identified as 71-314 and 70-941 In 1969, military requirements resulted in a change in mission when the group was reassigned from MAC transport duties to Strategic Air Command (SAC). Under SAC the group became an air refueling unit, being equipped with the air refueling version of the C-97 transport, the KC-97. Familiarity with the aircraft led to a smooth transition from MAC to the new refueling mission. It supported the United States Air Forces in Europe flying aerial refueling missions in the KC-97 supporting missions of deploying aircraft to NATO for tactical exercises.  Tactical Airlift In 1976 the KC-97s were retired by SAC and the unit returned to MAC as its gaining command. The 180th was re-equipped with Lockheed C-130A Hercules tactical airlifters and returned to its transport mission. With the C-130s the 180th supported Operation Volant Oak and Operation Coronet Oak at Howard Air Force Base, Panama. During a 180th deployment to Howard in November 1978, they were caught up in a \\"real world\\" situation when the world began to learn of the events unfolding in Jonestown, Guyana. The 180th, flying the C-130, was the first US military aircraft landing at Timehri International Airport, Guyana with US embassy officials that they had picked up in Venezuela as well as food and supplies meant for the survivors the Americans hoped to take out of Guyana. That, of course, was before it became apparent that most of the more than 900 Peoples Temple members were lying dead in Jonestown. In December 1989, the 180th was once again deployed at Howard when Operation Just Cause began. The 180th flew combat missions in support of the Operation. In late 1980 and through 1983, members of the 180th embarked on a special project to enhance survivability of C-130 aircrews while flying in a hostile environment. The need for this type of training became apparent after C-130 units from MAC began to participate in Red Flag exercises at Nellis Air Force Base. It was obvious that the C-130s were not doing well against the ground and air threats posed in the Red Flag exercise. After approval from the National Guard Bureau and tacitly from MAC, they began service test to validate the training program. After more than three service test, the program proved it worth and the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center was approved and instituted on 4 February 1984. In March 1987, the 180th began to receive brand new C-130H2 Hercules aircraft replacing the C-130A model aircraft they had flown for the past ten years. In October 1987, the 180th deployed two C-130H2 aircraft supporting a United States Army Special Forces and the Royal Australian Special Air Service Regiment in a combined personnel airdrop exercise called Badge Anvil 1987 at RAAF Learmonth, Australia. The exercise provided high altitude low opening and high altitude high opening parachute training. Since all of the airdrops occurred above 10,000 feet and as high as 24,500 feet, the 15th Physiological Training Flight also supported the exercise and provided supplemental oxygen equipment, training and support for the training missions. Each flight was like going to the altitude chamber. In 1989, the 180th with four C-130H2 aircraft deployed to Kimhae International Airport, Republic of Korea in support of Operation Team Spirit 1989. During the exercise, the 180th flew challenging missions including tactical resupply, fuel bladder missions, assault landings on short runways including landing on highway landing strips, numerous airdrop missions including both visual, high altitude and radar drop scenarios. 1991 Gulf War 180th Tactical Airlift Squadron flying over Kuwait 1991 The 180th Tactical Airlift Squadron was ordered to the active service on 28 December 1990, as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to support Operation Desert Shield. For some unit members, this would be a return to the Persian Gulf as they had volunteered and deployed with 2 C-130H aircraft, aircrews, maintenance and support personnel, to form the first Air National Guard provisional airlift squadron in September 1990. On 2 January 1991, the 180th TAS and its 8 C-130H aircraft and personnel departed Rosecrans Air National Guard Base for Al Ain Air Base, United Arab Emirates. Deployed elements were assigned to the 1632nd Tactical Airlift Squadron (Provisional) as part of the 1630th Tactical Airlift Wing (Provisional) which was under the 1610th Airlift Division (Provisional). The unit remained at Al Ain Air Base through the air war and the ground war flying combat and combat support missions in support of the allied operations. Beginning on 22 March 1991, the 180th redeployed to Al Kharj Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The 180th departed Al Kharj Air Base on 28 May 1991, and returned to Rosecrans Air National Guard Base on 30 May 1991.When the aircraft arrived home, they had \\"nose art\\" on each courtesy of the crew chiefs. The nose art was 391 \\"Connie Kay\\", 392 \\"Desert Possum\\", 393 \\"Spirit of St. Joe\\", 394 \\"The Hog\\", 395 \\"Chief\\", 396 \\"Buzzard\\", 397 \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and 398 \\"Fike's Filly\\". The 180th was relieved from active duty and released back to state control on 24 June 1991. During the 1990s, the 180th provided airlift support to the United States Air Forces Europe during the airlift operations into Bosnia and Herzegovina. These operations were named Operation Provide Promise, Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Joint Guard and Operation Joint Forge. Members of the 180th along with operations support and maintenance personnel would deploy to Rhein-Main Air Base and, after it closed, to Ramstein Air Base and assigned to \\"Delta Squadron\\". The Air National Guard would generally be responsible for a 90- or 120-day period and guard members would typically volunteer for duty for a minimum of a two- to three-week period although some would volunteer for longer periods.

The 180th Airlift Squadron was notified in February 2003 that it would be partially mobilized as a result of the impending conflict in Iraq which would later be known as Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit deployed in March 2003 to the Iraqi theater and later supported Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and was released from active duty in March 2006 and reverted to state control. This was a historic partial mobilization that lasted three years. The 180th remained in a state of partial activation for three years until it was released from mobilization in March 2006 and reverted to state control. =Lineage= ; 180th Military Airlift Squadron * Constituted as the 438th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) on 19 June 1942 : Activated on 26 June 1942 : Redesignated 438th Bombardment Squadron, Medium c. 1944 : Redesignated 438th Bombardment Squadron, Light on 3 February 1945 : Inactivated on 13 December 1945 * Redesignated 180th Bombardment Squadron, Light and allotted to the National Guard on 24 May 1946Lineage information through March 1946 in Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 542‚Äì543 : Activated on 21 June 1946 : Extended federal recognition on 22 August 1946 : Federalized and placed on active duty on 1 April 1951 : Inactivated and returned to Missouri state control on 1 January 1953 : Activated on 1 January 1953 : Redesignated 180th Bombardment Squadron, Tactical c. 1955 : Redesignated 180th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 15 June 1957 : Redesignated 180th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Photographic, Jet on 10 April 1958 : Redesignated 180th Air Transport Squadron, Heavy on 14 April 1962 : Redesignated 180th Military Airlift Squadron on 1 January 1966 : Inactivated on 5 September 1969 : Consolidated with 180th Airlift Squadron on 31 May 1991 ; 180th Airlift Squadron : Constituted as the 180th Air Refueling Squadron, c. 1969 : Activated on 5 September 1969 : Redesignated 180th Tactical Airlift Squadron on 16 October 1976 : Federalized and placed on active duty on 28 December 1990 : Consolidated with 180th Military Airlift Squadron on 31 May 1991 : Released from active duty and returned to Missouri state control on 24 June 1991 : Redesignated 180th Airlift Squadron on 1 June 1992 =Assignments= * 319th Bombardment Group, 26 June 1942 ‚Äì 13 December 1945 * Missouri National Guard, 21 June 1946 * 66th Fighter Wing, June 1946 * 126th Bombardment Group, February 1947 * 131st Composite Group, 1 November 1950 * 126th Bombardment Group, 1 February 1951 ‚Äì 1 January 1953 * 140th Fighter-Bomber Group, 1 January 1953 * 131st Bombardment Group (later 131st Fighter-Interceptor Group), March 1953 * 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, 10 April 1958 * 139th Air Transport Group (later 139th Military Airlift Group), 14 April 1962 * 139th Air Refueling Group (later 139th Tactical Airlift Group, 139th Airlift Group), 5 September 1969 * 139th Operations Group, 1 October 1995 ‚Äì present =Stations= * Barksdale Field, Louisiana, 26 June 1942 * Harding Army Air Field, Louisiana, 8‚Äì27 August 1942 * RAF Shipdham (AAF-115), England, 12 September 1942 * RAF Horsham St Faith (AAF-123), England, 5‚Äì21 October 1942 * Saint-Leu Airfield, Algeria, c. 10 November 1942 * Oran Tafaraoui Airport, Algeria, 17 November 1942 * Maison Blanche Airport, Algeria, c. 26 November 1942 * Telergma Airfield, Algeria, 13 December 1942 * Oujda Airfield, French Morocco, 3 March 1943 * Rabat-Sal√© Airport, French Morocco, 25 April 1943 * Sedrata Airfield, Algeria, 1 June 1943 * Djedeida Airfield, Tunisia, 26 June 1943 * Decimomannu Airfield, Sardinia, Italy, 1 November 1943 * Serragia Airfield, Corsica, France, 22 September 1944 ‚Äì c. 9 January 1945 * Bradley Field, Connecticut, 25 January 1945 * Columbia Army Air Base, South Carolina, 28 February ‚Äì 28 April 1945 * Kadena Airfield, Okinawa, 3 July 1945 * Machinato-Naha Airfield, Okinawa, 21 July ‚Äì 23 November 1945 * Vancouver Barracks, Washington, c. 11‚Äì13 December 1945 * Rosecrans Memorial Airport, Missouri, 22 August 1946 * Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, 1 April ‚Äì 1 November 1951 * Bordeaux-Merignac Air Base, France 1 November 1951 ‚Äì 25 May 1952 * Laon-Couvron Air Base, France, 25 May 1952 ‚Äì 31 December 1952 * Rosecrans Memorial Airport (later Rosecrans Air National Guard Base), Missouri, 1 January 1953 =Aircraft= * Martin B-26 Marauder, 1942 ‚Äì 1944 * North American B-25 Mitchell, 1944 ‚Äì 1945 * Douglas A-26 (later B-26) Invader, 1945 ‚Äì 1946, 1946 ‚Äì 1957 * Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star, 1957 ‚Äì 1958 * Republic RF-84F Thunderflash, 1958 ‚Äì 1961 * Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter, 1961 ‚Äì 1968 * Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, 1968 ‚Äì 1976 * Lockheed C-130A Hercules, 1976 ‚Äì 1987 * Lockheed C-130H2 Hercules, 1987 ‚Äì present See also * List of United States Air Force installations * Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center References Notes ;: Explanatory notes ; Citations = Bibliography = * Gross, Charles J (1996), The Air National Guard and the American Military Tradition, United States Dept. of Defense,  External links * 126th Bombardment Wing (Light) Squadrons of the United States Air National Guard Military units and formations in Missouri 180 ","title":"180th Airlift Squadron"},{"id":"3521965","text":"Two Hills is a town in central Alberta, Canada.

It is at the junction of Highway 43 and Highway 49, between the Little Smoky River and Sturgeon Lake. Its position, in the junction of the two highways into the Peace Region, has led to the town motto, \\"Portal to the Peace\\".  History  The area around Valleyview has been inhabited by native peoples for thousands of years due to the area's rich hunting and fishing grounds. The local Cree population has lived in the region since at least the 18th century. In the early 1800s the first visitors to the area arrived, seeking natives to exchange goods for furs. The trading was good and a Hudson's Bay Company post was established on Sturgeon Lake in 1877. Peace River Jim‚Äô Cornwall established the Bredin and Cornwall Trading Post nearby. The area was surveyed in 1900 for a possible settlement, but little developed of it. The following year the area was surveyed again by Fred Young who was particularly impressed with a piece of land on the northwest shore of Sturgeon Lake. By 1916 the first pioneers settled in the area nearby as its soil was rich for farming. The community that formed to serve the growing population was initially named Red Willow Creek. Only when the first post office was opened in 1929 did the community change its name to Valleyview. In late 1950 oil was discovered near the hamlet. The Whitecourt Cutoff project was completed in 1955, significantly reducing the travel time between the Peace Country and Edmonton. In 2020 the Town of Valleyview and Chamber of Commerce renamed a stretch of the highway to recognize the 65th anniversary of the cutoff's completion. By the late fifties Valleyview had firmly achieved boomtown status having been incorporated as a village in 1954 and then a town only three years later in 1957. Geography The town is located in the southern Peace Region between the Little Smoky River and Sturgeon Lake. As noted by its name, the town is elevated and overlooks the surrounding valleys. Sturgeon Lake is located approximately 15 km west of the town and is home to Young's Point Provincial Park, a popular provincial park in the area. Residing next to the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation reservation #154, within the land of treaty 8.

Tervita began in Valleyview as Concord Well Servicing in 1979, founded by David Werklund and Gordon Vivian, and still has operations in the area. Pembina Pipeline has an office in Valleyview and operates a terminal facility south of town along with managing other assets in the area. The industry also supports a variety of well service companies and related businesses. The travel industry is also a major component in Valleyview. Situated along the CANAMEX Corridor and at the junction of two major highways, a service corridor has developed to cater to the needs of travelers. Hotels/motels, gas/service stations and fast food establishments have been built adjacent to the portions of Highway 43 and Highway 49 that pass through town.

Construction New Bedford (PF-71) was built by the Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, and was launched there on 29 December 1943. She was sponsored by four year old Cynthia Zeilinski, who at the time was believed to be the youngest sponsor of a fighting ship. New Bedford was towed down the Mississippi River and ferried to Houston, Texas, for completion and fitting out. She was commissioned 18 November 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Commander J. S. Muzzy, USCG. Service history She proceeded to Bermuda on 6 December 1944, for a month's shakedown exercises, returning to Philadelphia on 12 January 1945 for post-shakedown availability. Departing New York on 6 February 1945, New Bedford proceeded to Oran escorting her first trans- Atlantic convoy which put safely into Oran on 23 February. On 3 March the frigate joined the anti-submarine screen of a west bound convoy, arriving Boston 20 March. She next sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to pick up an east bound convoy. She departed Hampton Roads 8 April and arrived at Oran on 24 April. She made her final westbound passage on 2 May and arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, on 19 May. She was then converted for duty as a weather ship while on an availability that lasted until 31 July 1945. She was assigned to weather patrol in the Pacific and sailed from Boston on 31 July. The war ended as she was en route from the Panama Canal Zone to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 27 August 1945. Three days later she departed for Guam. For the next six months, New Bedford stood regular weather station patrols, returning to Guam, her home base, only long enough to fuel, provision, and afford a period of recreation for the crew. The weather patrols were, for the most part, dull and tiring. Violent tropical storms sometimes beat her unmercifully as she stood her station. Once a Japanese destroyer on a peaceful repatriation mission was sighted. The frigate arrived at San Francisco, California, on 10 March 1946, and then proceeded to Seattle, Washington. She was decommissioned there on 24 May 1946.

Geography  Westlock is located approximately north of Edmonton, Alberta's provincial capital and Canada's sixth largest census metropolitan area. Westlock sits at the junction of Highway 44 and Highway 18. It is surrounded by Westlock County within Census Division 13. Westlock lies on the Alberta plain, one of the Great Plains. It lies just to the north of the continental divide between the Athabasca and North Saskatchewan river basins, and to the east of the Pembina River, a tributary of the Athabasca. The town is about above mean sea level. Westlock sits within the humid continental climate zone, on the northern edge of the aspen parkland belt, a once heavily treed region that was cleared for agriculture at the turn of the 20th century. It is a relatively fertile region of dark soils. To the north lies the subarctic climate zone. The mean annual precipitation averaged from one meteorological station within the county measured 468 millimetres (mm), based on data from 1980 to 1990. The mean annual temperature averaged 1.9 ¬∞C, with the mean monthly temperature reaching a high of 16.8 ¬∞C in July, and dropping to a low of -11.4 ¬∞C in January.http://www.10714.com/pdf/rgwa/westlock.pdf  History  Prior to European settlement, the area around Westlock was inhabited by First Nations people, notably the Cree. Although the fur trade had been active in Alberta since 1754 when Anthony Henday explored the area, the Westlock district was not mentioned in writing until David Thompson came through in April 1799. Post office in Edison, 1906 White settlement did not begin until 1902 at that time centred on a rural community about east of present-day Westlock. The founding family was named Edgson, but this was considered too hard to pronounce. Edson, Alberta already existed, so the site was called Edison by its Irish-Canadian founders, after the American inventor Thomas Edison. The community in 1912 consisted of a total of no more than 13 buildings: a harness shop, a blacksmith shop, several homes, two churches, and one family living in a tent. There was also a post office but this was closed in 1911 when Conservative Party came to power and fired many Liberals from the postal service.http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=display_original‚â∂=English&fl;=0&rd;=117752&ex;=471 In 1911 the railway reached nearby Clyde to the east, and in 1912 the E.D. & B.C. Railway (later the Northern Alberta Railway, now part of CN) mapped a new townsite where Westlock now stands to the west. Edison was now caught between the two. In 1914, the Methodist church building was picked up and moved down the road to Westlock, an indication of the new settlement's ascendancy over the older one. The name of the new town is a portmanteau of the names of William Westgate and William Lockhart, who owned the property. Westlock was incorporated as a village on 16 March 1916, with a population of 65 residents. The first reeve was George MacTavish, and in that same year, the first grain elevator was built. The first bank branch, the Merchant's Bank opened its doors in 1918. A permanent brick schoolhouse was built in 1925. The Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Halifax operated a hospital out of a former house in 1927, and a purpose-built hospital, the Immaculata, was opened in 1928. Westlock became a town on 7 January 1947 with a population of 854. That same year, the Memorial Hall was also built. In 1992 the Memorial Hall burned down, later to be replaced. In 1995, the hospital was replaced by the Westlock Health Care Centre, a somewhat controversial decision because several other communities in Alberta were facing hospital closures at the time. In 1997, the old hospital was demolished.

Of the total private dwellings, there were 1,410 housing units (houses or apartments) which were owned, and 650 which were rented. The majority of the housing stock (1,630) was constructed before 1986, while 430 units were built between 1986 and 2006. The average value of owned dwellings was $148,083 (compared to Albertan average of $293,811). ;Families and households There were 2,060 households, of which 1,355 were considered census families in 2006, with an average of 2.8 persons per family, compared to an Alberta average of 3.0.

For those under the age of 18, the rate was 10.4% (compared to Alberta averages of 12.2% and 14.2% respectively).  Economy  The area around Westlock is primarily agricultural, although there is some oil and gas activity. The main employers in town include the hotels and inns that cater to oilpatch workers, the farm implement dealerships, and some small manufacturing such as Wabash Mfg. Inc. - custom manufacturing, and a Lafarge cement plant. Additionally, Westlock still retains its original purpose as a centre for the grain trade, as CN still accepts grains from the remaining grain elevators, now owned by a new generation co-operative, Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD. Also, Westlock is a centre of government as it is the location of Westlock County's municipal office and home of public and Catholic schools, a courthouse, a public library, and a modern hospital. As such, Westlock is the central town of the region where rural families do business, send their children to school, and obtain government services. Many rural people retire in the town, and there are several old age homes. Westlock is too far from Edmonton to serve as a bedroom community but some people do commute. Of increasing importance to the community since the Second World War has been highway traffic heading to oilfields in Northern Alberta. Recent retail developments have shifted from the railway era downtown to larger malls and businesses along the highway. One recent proposal was for a residential development adjoining Westlock Airport which would allow people to commute to the oilsand projects in Fort McMurray and other northern developments, but this has not been started as yet.  Government  Westlock's current MP is Arnold Viersen, representing the riding of Peace River-Westlock. In the 2015 Canadian Federal Election Westlock became part of the newly formed Peace River‚ÄîWestlock federal electoral district. The MLA who represents Westlock is Glenn van Dijken. The town's mayor is Ralph Leriger.

The band broke up in 1982. History =Formation and early years= Casey Cameron formed an all-kazoo band (\\"Kazoondheit\\") with her neighbors, among whom were Larry Bangor (aka Larry Soucy), Dini Lamot (brother of Larry and cousin to \\"Pecky\\" Lamot), and Windle Davis. The four became fast friends and soon formed an a cappella country-and-western band called Honey Bea and the Meadow Muffins, who played at parties and in the subway. Encouraged, the four decided to start a rock band. Posting ads, the quartet met three musician/composers, drummer Malcolm Travis, guitarist Rich Gilbert, and bass player Rolfe Anderson. These seven became the original lineup of HSR, with Anderson being replaced on bass by Chris Maclachlan in 1980. Bangor was the main lead singer, though Lamot, Davis, and Cameron each sometimes sang lead. They named the band after the groundbreaking, and now classic, Masters and Johnson best-seller. =Recordings= After Maclachlan joined the band, they recorded two full-length albums, Fig. 14 (1980) and In a Roman Mood (1981), as well as 1981's Pound EP. Their tune \\"Jackie Onassis\\", from Fig. 14, got airplay beyond college radio, while other songs, such as \\"What Does Sex Mean to Me?\\" and \\"Land of the Glass Pinecones,\\" had more of a cult success. Fig. 15 was a CD release in the '90s, and it contained all of Fig. 14 plus the song \\"Butt Fuck\\" that landed the band in hot water when they performed it on the live local overnight TV show Five All Night, Live All Night. =Post- breakup= Human Sexual Response broke up in 1982. Casey dropped out of show business and worked as a content developer for Sun Microsystems in the Bay Area. She is the mother of Cameron Mesirow, who makes music as Glasser, originally based in Los Angeles, prior to her move to New York. Travis, Gilbert, Bangor and Maclachlan went on to form a band, The Zulus (a/k/a Wild Kingdom, a/k/a Screaming Mimis, a/k/a the Gospel Birds) and released a self- titled LP in 1985, and then Down On The Floor in 1989 on Slash Records, produced by Bob Mould of Husker Du. Malcolm Travis later played drums for Mould's Sugar, and for Kustomized. Rich Gilbert was a member of Concussion Ensemble, Country Bumpkins, a project band called Clown, Frank Black and the Catholics, played on four Tanya Donelly solo releases, and currently plays pedal steel with Thad Cockerell. Upon moving to Nashville, Tennessee, Gilbert has gone on to perform with such artists as Jen Jones, and Travis Mann, and is currently teamed with drummer Steve Latination, bassist Zack Shedd, and vocalist Meat Johnson to form the local power quartet Meat and Three. From 2001-2003 he formed the Blackstone Valley Sinners, based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, with Slim Cessna of Slim Cessna's Auto Club and Gilbert's then-wife Judith-Ann. In 2009 he began playing with Eileen Rose in The Silver Threads, a classic country honky tonk cover band. Dini Lamot launched a new career as \\"Musty Chiffon.\\" Aided by long-time partner Windle Davis, Lamot/Chiffon recorded a dance version of \\"Jackie Onassis\\" in 1999. The two formerly operated a bed and breakfast in Hudson, NY, and at one time a local theater offering entertainment ranging from puppetry to drag shows. The band reunited for special Halloween shows in 1984 at Spit and 1986 at The Channel, a New Year's Eve show in December 1988 at the Paradise , and on November 29, 2008 at Jason's Upstairs Bar in Hudson, NY.

Following the publication of the third volume of his book Affect Imagery Consciousness in 1991, his body of work received renewed interest, leading to attempts by others to summarize and popularize his theories. Biography The following is a summary based on a biographical essay by Irving Alexander. Silvan Tomkins was born in Philadelphia to Russian Jewish immigrants, and raised in Camden, New Jersey. He studied playwriting as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, but immediately on graduating he enrolled as a graduate student in psychology. However, he withdrew upon completing only the master's degree, finding the Penn Psychology Department's emphasis on psychophysics unfriendly to his interests. Remaining at Penn, he received his PhD in Philosophy in 1934, working on value theory with Edgar A. Singer, Jr. After a year handicapping horse races, he relocated to Harvard for postdoctoral study in Philosophy with W.V. Quine. In time, he became aware of the Harvard Psychological Clinic, and in 1937 he joined its staff, entering a particularly productive and happy period of his life. During this period, he published his first book, Contemporary Psychopathology, containing a survey of contemporary thought as well as his own contribution to it. He wrote a book about the projective Thematic Apperception Test, then developed the Picture Arrangement Test that combined elements of projection and forced choice. In 1947, he married Elizabeth \\"BeeGee\\" Taylor; the marriage would last nearly three decades. The same year, he moved to Princeton University's Department of Psychology to take a position that would entail a large amount of frustration. First, he would work at the Educational Testing Service, which required him to submit documentation of the precise hours he worked in the building. At the same time, he worked for Princeton University, which never fully supported the graduate program in Clinical Psychology which he tried to establish. During his Princeton career, he was able to spend a year at the Ford Center in Palo Alto, California, where he wrote what became the first two volumes of Affect Imagery Consciousness. At this point in his career, he began to have a mentoring relationship with two younger scholars‚ÄîPaul Ekman and Carroll Izard‚Äîwho would later become better known than Tomkins and whose early concepts of emotion owe much to Tomkins'. After receiving an NIMH career research award, he left Princeton for CUNY Graduate Center in 1965, then in 1968 moved to Rutgers University, from which he retired in 1975 to work on his script theory. Affect theory Disagreements among theorists persist today over Tomkins' firm insistence that there were nine and only nine affects, biologically based. The basic six are: interest-excitement, enjoyment-joy, surprise-startle, distress-anguish, anger-rage, and fear-terror. Tomkins always described the first six, and one that \\"evolved later\\" (shame- humiliation) in pairs. In these pairs, the first pair part names the mild manifestation and the second the more intense. The final two affects described by Tomkins are \\"dissmell\\" and disgust. Tomkins argued that these nine affects are quite discrete (whereas emotions are complex and muddled), that they manifest a shared biological heritage with what is called emotion in animals, and that they differ from Freudian drives in lacking an object.  Script Theory  Tomkins (1979) argues that the basic unit of analysis which we use to determine scripts is called a ‚Äúscene‚Äù. A scene is defined as a sequence of events linked by the affects triggered during the experience of those events. Scripts follow scenes identifying patterns in interactions and respond based on the societal perspectives. In social settings, the behaviors and responses of individuals can be determined based on the setting and the interaction. According to Wiederman, social scripts provide meaning and direction on how to respond to specific situations (Wiederman, 2005). Without scripts we would not be able to identify correct or appropriate responses to specific situations.  Queer theory  In their paper Shame in the Cybernetic Fold: Reading Silvan Tomkins, Queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Science and Technology Studies Professor Adam Frank examine the relevance of Tomkin's work for queer theory as well as poststructuralist theory more generally, arguing that Tomkins' work may provide important epistemological insights about the self.

The exact nature of the operation, if it did indeed exist, is subject to disagreement -- most accounts link it to investigations into the sale of Nauruan passports, the defection of North Korean scientists to the West, or both. This was a classic example of what is known as a canary trap - a spy tactic of feeding sufficiently important intelligence (traceable but false) to suspects to find leaks. The first public mentions of Operation Weasel were made in March 2003, when The Australian printed a story claiming that the Nauruan embassy in Beijing was a front by which North Korean defectors could be assisted in escaping to the West. According to the report, Nauru had been approached by individuals claiming to represent the governments of New Zealand and the United States, who wished to smuggle North Korean defectors through the embassies of a third, neutral party. According to the paper, Nauru would receive cash compensation for participating, and the Nauruan embassy in Beijing would be paid for and staffed by New Zealand and United States personnel. New Zealand and United States officials were reported as denying the story. The embassy, when it was established, was run by charg√© d'affaires Jack Sanders, a New Zealander. (The Herald also said that Sanders was wanted by police, although this has been labelled a smear campaign following an investigation by Scoop reporter Selwyn Manning.http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0411/S00358.htm He later came to public attention as a source for a controversial news story about the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, which was later retracted). According to the original reports in The Australian, at least twenty defectors were successfully smuggled out. Nauru's embassies in Beijing and Washington were closed in August 2003, with the Nauruan government having been sent documents claiming that they were selling diplomatic passports. President Ludwig Scotty stated at the time that staff were \\"not serving their intended purpose\\". Trans-Pacific Development Corporation was involved in the sale of Nauruan passports, allowing passports to fall into the hands of terrorists -- according to their claims, Operation Weasel was originally a project by various agencies in New Zealand and the United States (including the US Central Intelligence Agency) to stop these activities, and only later became a front for North Korean defections.

The Java Native Interface (JNI) enabled developers to add platform-dependent functionality to Java applications. The JNI enables developers to add time-critical operations like mathematical calculations and 3D rendering. Previously, native 3D rendering was a problem because the native code didn't have access to the graphic context. The AWT Native Interface is designed to give developers access to an AWT \`Canvas\` for direct drawing by native code. In fact, the Java 3D API extension to the standard Java SE JDK relies heavily on the AWT Native Interface to render 3D objects in Java. The AWT Native Interface is very similar to the JNI, and, the steps are, in fact, the same as those of the JNI. See the Java Native Interface article for an explanation of the JNI techniques employed by the AWT Native Interface. The AWT Native Interface was added to the Java platform with the J2SE 1.3 (\\"Kestrel\\") version.  AWT Native Interface steps  A complete walkthrough example of this technology is available on Wikibooks (see link below). = Create a Java application = See the Java Native Interface article for an explanation of the \`native\` keyword and the \`loadLibrary()\` method. A \`paint()\` method will be simply invoked when the AWT event dispatching thread \\"repaints\\" the screen. = Create a C++ header file = Create the C++ header file as usual (See Java Native Interface for more complete explanations.) = Implement the C++ native code = Type this in a file named \\"NativeSideCanvas.cpp\\" and compile into a library. See Java Native Interface (JNI) for a more complete explanation. (For Solaris code and other operating systems see links below.) = Run the program = One should run the file as usual. One should then see a window with, for example, a rectangle drawn in it. (See Java Native Interface for complete instructions.) Note: One can notice that the AWT Native Interface requires the \\"jawt.dll\\" (or \\"jawt.so\\") to run with the application, so the easiest way to do that is copying the \\"jawt.dll\\" (should be in the .../jre/bin file path of the JDK's installation path.)  Native painting  One can paint as if it is a native application. In Windows, the JVM will pass a HWND and other window information to the native application so that the application will \\"know\\" where to draw. It could use GDI to draw a Rectangle.

It provides education for grades 9-12 and is operated by Gwinnett County Public Schools. The school was built in 1958 and serves Duluth, Berkeley Lake, Peachtree Corners, and unincorporated portions of western Gwinnett County. As of 2019, it has 2,741 students enrolled. DHS holds a Blue Ribbon School award. In its 2012 Georgia rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked it tenth among all public, charter and magnet schools, fourth among all public schools, and first among all Gwinnett County public schools. Niche ranked Duluth as the most diverse public high school in Georgia and the 24th most diverse public high school in America.https://www.niche.com/k12/duluth-high-school-duluth-ga/ History =Early years= Education in Duluth was first mentioned in records around 1880, according to Flanigan's History of Gwinnett County,Flanigan, History of Gwinnett County Vol.1, and was called Duluth Academy. It began with 59 students who were taught mathematics, science, and the classics. The first building was a frame structure on the site of the former Duluth Middle School at 3057 N. Peachtree Street. The land had been donated by Singleton Howell, son of Evan Howell, a successful merchant and farmer. In 1907, the frame building was moved to the front of the lot and replaced by a brick building. The first students graduated in 1912. In 1933, Duluth was accredited and was housed in one large building and staffed by 12 teachers. The school property was valued at $35,000. In the summer of 1935, lightning struck the steeple of the school and fire destroyed the building. Classes were held temporarily in the old Baptist and Methodist churches while a new building could be constructed. Until 1938, the school included only grades 1 through 11. 12th grade was added in 1954. =1950s= A bond issue in 1955 provided $659,000 to be added to $1,807,000 of state funds to erect four high school buildings: Central Gwinnett in Lawrenceville, South Gwinnett in Snellville, West Gwinnett in Norcross, and North Gwinnett in Suwanee. Hooper-Renwick Elementary, Sugar Hill Elementary, Harmony Elementary, and Hull Elementary were also built. These funds also provided for additions to Dacula, Lilburn, Duluth, Centerville, Norcross, Snellville, Grayson, Bethesda, and Suwanee schools. In the school year of 1957‚Äì58, Duluth High School as such ceased to exist for the secondary-level (grades 8-12) students. They were consolidated into West Gwinnett High School in Norcross. This school was located so far from Duluth that parents of many of the students were unhappy and campaigned for the recreation of a high school in the Duluth vicinity. The strong parental influence was heard as the people of Gwinnett County voted for a school bond and construction program to begin on a school to be located on Brock Road. Duluth High School would once again be in existence. Before Christmas in 1958, the high school students attended classes at Duluth Elementary School, while awaiting the completion of their new building. Duluth High School is now located at 3737 Brock Road NW, Duluth. When the recreated Duluth High School was opened for attendance in 1958, the building consisted of 12 classrooms and an enrollment of 200. The faculty consisted of 10 teachers, as compared to the 150 employed in 2006. =1960s and 1970s= Purple and white were chosen as the colors and the wildcat was chosen as a mascot. In 1962, the original gymnasium was completed on donated land. The school buildings were further extended from 12 to 16 rooms in 1963, and to 18 in 1967. A vocational building was added in 1971. New football stands were constructed in 1966. The Lions Club donated money for tennis courts to be built in 1967 and a new football field house in the spring of 1969. A new vocational building was completed in 1971, housing an expanded home economics department, library, and industrial arts department. In 1969, 1971, and 1972, the football team claimed regional championships with North Georgia championships won in 1973 and 1975. =1980s= In 1985 a 5,000-seat stadium was opened and named after Tim Maxwell, the first Duluth resident to be killed in World War II. In 1986, new additions and renovations included a 300-seat theater, four science laboratories, a choral suite, new art facilities, expanded band room, media center, a new cafeteria, and 24 new classrooms. A larger gym was completed in 1989. The old gym was used for physical education classes, additional basketball practice, and wrestling. Enrollment grew to approximately 1,200. More courses were offered, including fine arts, foreign languages, gifted, AP/joint enrollment, debate, and computer programs. The Guidance Department, beginning in 1968, increased to a full-time staff of three. In 1984, \\"Project Twin City\\" was conceived to enable cultural exchange between six students from Duluth, Georgia, and Duluth, Minnesota. =1990s= The school continued to expand throughout the 1990s as Gwinnett County grew and received National School of Excellence status in 1991, and in 1992 was recognized by Redbook Magazine as one of the \\"Nation's Best 140 Schools.\\" The 500 Building opened in the fall of 1997 with a media center, the main office, and classrooms for science, language arts, and mathematics. By the 1998‚Äì99 school year, enrollment had reached 2,155. =2000s= A new field house with a weight room, coach's offices, media room, and locker rooms was completed in 2001. A stadium with new home stands and track was completed for the opening of the fall football season in 2002. The press box was named for \\"the voice of the Wildcats,\\" State Representative Brooks Coleman. The old gymnasium built in 1962 was connected to a large new gym with an indoor walking track, exercise room, coach's offices, and physical education classrooms. In 2003, the new gym was dedicated and named for former Duluth basketball coach and athletic director, Joe Marelle, and was officially opened for the 2003 basketball season. Duluth's enrollment reached 2,620 in the 2002‚Äì03 school year. As construction began on the new 600 building, 54 temporary classrooms filled every empty space on the campus. Approximately 1,000 students were transferred to the new Peachtree Ridge High School in nearby Suwanee in the fall of 2003. Enrollment increased again to approximately 2,000 by 2005. By the start of the 2005‚Äì06 school year, the campus of Duluth High was brand new. The cafeteria was expanded and was flanked by landscaped courtyards featuring a circular bricked entrance to the new 600 building. The 400 Fine Arts building features a refurbished and enlarged choral room, band and orchestra rooms, and art facilities. The 300 Technology Building houses updated multimedia and computer labs. The four-story 600 Building includes the new main office, a 600-seat theater, and more than 60 classrooms for science, social studies, foreign languages, and special education. In 2004 and 2005, Duluth students earned Hope Scholarship grants, and the success of its Advanced Placement program resulted in Duluth receiving the 2005 \\"Siemens Award for Advanced Placement for Georgia\\" bestowed by the College Board to schools showing excellence in math and science. Student extracurricular clubs and activities continued to be recognized locally and nationally. Two state championships in girls' softball and competitive cheerleading, along with championship soccer, have kept Duluth's athletes in the news. Duluth's swim and dive team had eight Top Ten finishes at the State Championships between 1999-2008, with Kelsey Scott becoming Duluth's first individual girl state champion swimmer when she won the 500 freestyle in 2005. She was followed by girl diver Lexie Bryant, who won the 2006 State Diving Championships, becoming the first Duluth girl diver and Gwinnett County girl diver to win state. The 2005 and 2010 National Geography Champion came from Duluth. Duluth's Orchestra was ranked the #1 public high school orchestra at the 2005 National Orchestra festival in Reno, Nevada. Duluth's musicians and choral students hold seats in state orchestras and choirs. =2010s= In 2010, the 600 building was changed into the \\"Freshman Academy\\" (abolished two years later), where all freshman had their core classes of World Geography, Algebra I, Language Arts, and Biology classes. All grades now attend classes in these buildings. In 2012, the social studies department moved all of their classes onto the second floor of the 600 building. Academics For the 2005-2006 year, Duluth had an average score of 1593 on the SAT, the second-highest average score in the county. Duluth High has been selected as the recipient of the 2005-06 Siemens Award for Advanced Placement in Georgia based on its performance and participation in the disciplines of math, science, and technology.

It searches through a prebuilt database of files generated by the \`updatedb\` command or by a daemon and compressed using incremental encoding. It operates significantly faster than \`find\`, but requires regular updating of the database. This sacrifices overall efficiency (because of the regular interrogation of filesystems even when no user needs information) and absolute accuracy (since the database does not update in real time) for significant speed improvements, particularly on very large filesystems. \`locate\` was first created in 1982.

Since 1976, it has been regrouped into a single, 11-story building, but with three secondary pavilions. Programs The CEGEP offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matter which roughly corresponds to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university, as well as an introductory specialization that generally happens in freshman year. The technical programs, which take three years to complete, apply to students who wish to pursue a skill or trade. Continuing education and services to business are also provided.

The station, owned by Northern Michigan University, is a National Public Radio member station, airing a large amount of classical and jazz music along with a variety of other local programming. It is operated by a combination of full-time staff members and students. The station serves the Upper Peninsula and northeastern Wisconsin. It first signed on in 1963 as WNMR. It joined the then year-old NPR in 1971 and adopted its current calls in 1975. WNMU-FM is licensed to broadcast in HD Radio, but opted to temporarily discontinue HD broadcasting in the spring of 2011 due to financial constraints. The station had planned to launch HD-2 and HD-3 side channels, one featuring entirely classical music and the other featuring entirely public radio news and information.http://wnmu.publicbroadcasting.net/media/Preview%20PDF/WNMU- FM_Preview_May11.pdf It had been the only Upper Peninsula radio station licensed for HD transmissions.  Translators  WNMU-FM programming can also be heard on the following translator stations across the Upper Peninsula: NOTE: W243CQ previously operated as W296AX on 107.1 FM. The translator changed frequencies due to the sign-on of 107.3 WUPF in Powers, Michigan, which serves the Escanaba area. Similarly, the Stephenson translator, which originally operated at 107.3, was forced off the air in July 2009 by the sign-on on WUPF. The translator received construction permits to move to 96.7 and 97.3, but transmission on those frequencies would have presented interference to WUPG 96.7 FM in Republic, Michigan, and WGLQ 97.1 FM in Escanaba, respectively. In June 2011, the translator was granted a construction permit to operate on 97.9, where it would not interfere in the protected coverage areas of any full-powered stations. That translator is now on the air at 97.9. Also, WNMU previously operated two other translators: * Newberry, Michigan at 91.1 FM (W216AI). The license for this translator was cancelled on June 17, 2020. * Menominee, Michigan at 91.3 FM (W217AA). As of May 2012, the license for this translator has been cancelled, due to the sign-on of WRMW, a full-power station on the same frequency in nearby Peshtigo, Wisconsin. It is not known whether NMU will seek another frequency in the Menominee area. WNMU's signal normally does not reach Sault Ste. Marie (although the W216AI translator formerly served that area). That city is instead served by Central Michigan University's public/NPR/jazz station WCMU-FM, via its local repeater WCMZ.

He is best known for the Battle of Haengju (ÌñâÏ£ºÎåÄÏ≤©; Âπ∏Â∑ûÂ§ßÊç∑) where he defeated an attacking force of about 30,000 Japanese with 2,800 troops. After the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, Lee Gwang-gwan and Kwokyeong, a North Korean patrol in Jeolla Province, joined the army of some 40,000 people. After that, he was stationed in Namwon, where he collected more than 1,000 volunteer soldiers and was promoted to a small division of Dakage, Kobayakawa, Japan. In addition, during the North Korean invasion, Dongwangsansan Fortress in Suwon was located, and a strong position was built, but the army was engaged in a war of land and a war of guerrilla fighters. In 1593, he divided his forces and ordered SeonguI, the deputy commander, to take the army to the Kimchusan Mountain, and then cross the Han River with 2,800 soldiers. He was dismissed for summary disposal of a police sergeant after earning his degree in the field, but was re-appointed as a judge of the Han family and was appointed as a police officer in 1596. When Jeong Yu-jaran broke out in 1597, he was forced to leave Ulsan with the emperor of Ming to block the enemy's north, but suddenly he retired as the commander of the Ming Dynasty. Afterwards, he attempted to attack the Japanese troops stationed in Yegyo Bridge in Suncheon, but failed due to the uncooperative efforts of the Ming Dynasty men who were reluctant to expand the war. He was a general who conducted the military for seven years during the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, and earned a major in history along with Admiral Yi Sun-shin of the sea. In 1599, he resigned his office due to old age and returned to his hometown. He was awarded the title of Prime Minister, first rank in 1604 (King Seonjo 37), and was designated as Yeongna County, and was named Chungjangsa.  Early life  Gwon Yul hailed from the prestigious Gwon clan of Andong (ÏïàÎèôÍ∂åÏî®; ÂÆâÊù±Ê¨äÊ∞è); his father, Gwon Cheol (Í∂åÏ≤†), was the Yeonguijeong (ÏòÅÏùòÏ†ï, È†òË≠∞Êîø), which was the equivalent of Prime Minister in the Korean court. However, Gwon did not begin his political or military career until he was 46. In 1582, he was first appointed a position in the Korean government and promoted to several different positions including the mayor of Uiju (ÏùòÏ£º) in 1591.  During Japanese invasions of Korea  When the Japanese forces invaded Korea in 1592, Gwon was appointed the mayor of Gwangju (Í¥ëÏ£º; ÂÖâÂ∑û), Jeolla province (Ï†ÑÎùºÎèÑ) and given the military command of the region. Gwon and his troops followed his commander Yi Gwang and headed towards Seoul to join the main force. However, Yi was eventually defeated by Japanese at Yongin (Ïö©Ïù∏). Gwon managed to retreat back to Gwangju, and gathered around 1,000 militia. = Battle of Ichi = When Japanese troops at Geumsan (Í∏àÏÇ∞), Jeolla province began to move to Jeonju (Ï†ÑÏ£º), Gwon moved his army to Ichi (Î∞∞Í≥†Í∞ú, Ïù¥Ïπò; Ê¢®Â≥ô), a gateway to Jeonju. Ten thousand Japanese troops under Kobayakawa Takakage (Â∞èÊó©Â∑ùÈöÜÊôØ) attacked Ichi. About 1,000 of Gwon's men fought and won the battle. Gwon supervised his unit by executing deserters personally, and his vanguard commander Hwang Jin (Ìô©ÏßÑ; ÈªÉÈÄ≤) kept fighting despite a gunshot injury. The battle resulted in the recapture of the Jeolla province. = Siege of Doksan = The Joseon Government recognized Gwon's heroics, and named him the new governor of the Jeolla province in the following year. Gwon then led an army of 10,000 to Gyeonggi to recapture Seoul once more, where he was joined by local militia and monks, which enabled Gwon to gather up to 20,000 men. Gwon's troops were stationed in the fortress Doksung (ÎèÖÏÑ±; Á¶øÂüé) near Suwon (ÏàòÏõê). Japanese forces led by Ukita Hideie (ÂÆáÂñúÂ§öÁßÄÂÆ∂) laid siege to the fort for one month, and Gwon's army was running out of water supplies. One day, Gwon ordered several war horses to be brought on the fort wall and washed with grains of rice. From a distance, it looked like the horses were bathed with plenty of water. The Japanese, who were waiting for the fort's water supply to run out, lost their spirits and retreated to Seoul. Gwon chased the retreating Japanese, inflicting casualties of over 3,000 men. After the war, the king Seonjo built a monument on the top of Doksung named Semadae (ÏÑ∏ÎßàÎåÄ; Ê¥óÈ¶¨Ëá∫), \\"the place where horses were washed\\", as a tribute to Gwon. After the battle, the Joseon government ordered Gwon to march northward and combat the Japanese in Seoul. = Battle of Haengju = Gwon and his men set up camp in the run-down fortress of Haengju (ÌñâÏ£ºÏÇ∞ÏÑ±; Âπ∏Â∑ûÂ±±Âüé) near Seoul. Although his forces were joined by local militias led by Kim Chun-il and monk soldiers led by Cheo Yung, his entire unit in Haengju was no more than 2,800 men. Threatened by this action, Japanese commanders Kat≈ç Kiyomasa (Âä†Ëó§Ê∏ÖÊ≠£) and Ukita, attacked Haengju fortress with 30,000 men, trying to finish off Gwon's troops once and for all. Ukita, who never led the attack in the frontline directly, led the Japanese toward the fortress. The Battle of Haengju commenced early in the morning of 12 February 1593. Japanese troops under Kato and Ukita, armed with muskets, surrounded the fortress and launched several massive attacks. However, Gwon's forces and the civilians at the fortress resisted heavily, throwing rocks, arrows, iron pellets, burning oil and molten iron at the Japanese. Korean anti-personnel gunpowder weapons called hwachas (ÌôîÏ∞®; ÁÅ´Ëªä) and explosive cannon shells called bigyeokjincheolloi (ÎπÑÍ≤©ÏßÑÏ≤úÎ¢∞; È£õÊìäÈúáÂ§©Èõ∑) were also utilized in this battle. The Japanese, with over 10,000 casualties and top generals Ukita, Ishida Mitsunari, and Kikkawa Hiroie wounded, were compelled to retreat and fled the region. It was one of the three greatest Korean military victories during the Seven-Year War, along with the Battle of Hansan Island (ÌïúÏÇ∞ÎåÄÏ≤©) and the Siege of Jinju (ÏßÑÏ£ºÎåÄÏ≤©). = After the Battle of Haengju = After the battle, he kept his position, until the peace talks between Ming Dynasty and Toyotomi Hideyoshi began. Then he moved to Jeolla province, and from then on, Gwon Yul became the Dowonsu, the Commander-in- chief of Korean forces. He was briefly removed from office due to his harsh treatment of deserters, but was restored back again in the following year. He ordered the Admiral of the Navy, Won Kyun, to battle the Japanese in the Battle of Chilchonryang, which was won by Japanese. However Admiral Yi Sun-sin was able to defeat the Japanese navy under Todo Takatora in the Battle of Myeongnyang. In 1597, Gwon and the Chinese commander Ma Gui planned to combat the Japanese in Ulsan, but the Chinese commander-in-chief ordered Gwon to withdraw. Then Gwon tried to attack the Japanese in Suncheon, but the idea was again rejected by the Chinese.  After the war  After the war, Gwon retired from all of his posts; he died on July 6, 1599. After his death, he was given the posthumous title of Yeonguijeong, and awarded the title of the Ildung Seonmu Gongshin (ÏùºÎì±ÏÑ†Î¨¥Í≥µÏã†; ‰∏ÄÁ≠âÂÆ£Ê≠¶ÂäüËá£) along with Yi Sun-sin and Won Kyun, the most prestigious award for the generals who fought during Japanese invasions of Korea. Gwon is remembered in Korean history as one of Korea's most successful and patriotic military commanders.

Life John Henry Rasor was born on 22 November 1849 in Indiana. He moved to Meade County, Kentucky, where he married Mary Ratchford. The couple were to have ten sons and two daughters. They moved to Iowa, and then in February 1883 moved to Texas, where Rasor rented a farm near Plano, Texas from Texas State Senator James R. Gough. Later he bought the farm and other land around it. The Rasors were largely self-sufficient. They grew their own vegetables, corn and wheat in the fertile Texas blackland prairies soil, and collected wild fruit and nuts. Depending on the season, they hunted for wild hogs that lived by the creeks, and for squirrels, and deer. Contrary to claims that the Rasors also hunted American Bison and American Black Bear, the ranges of those animals by the 1880s in Texas makes such claims highly unlikely, bison being exterminated in the Plano area thirty years prior to the Rasors' emigration. They dried and preserved the meat for later use. Later they raised their own hogs. The Rasors also raised cattle. Rasor was an extremely capable farmer, running a profitable operation and plowing back his profits into expanding the ranch. The Rasor family played a significant role in the cotton industry, with what became one of the largest operations in the area. Their ranch grew to cover nearly , with huge silos, barns and feedlots. They even had their own smithy. The ranch lay on both sides of what is now called Independence Parkway. At its largest extent the ranch included most of the area between Hedgcoxe Road and Highway 121 from Preston Road to Alma Road. John Henry Rasor died at his home on 5 November 1925 at the age of 75. Recognition In the early 1900s, a dirt road was renamed Rasor Road by Collin County. In the early 1990s, the City of Plano changed that name to Headquarters Drive, but by 2002, the City Council voted 6-2 to reverse the change and call a section of the road Rasor Boulevard. It currently extends from Preston Road to SH 121/SRT, changing to Headquarters Drive west of Preston Road and to Hillcrest Road north of SH 121/SRT. In 2003, the City of Plano dedicated William Henry \\"Buzz\\" Rasor Park on McDermott Road, just west of Coit Road, after one of John Henry Rasor's grandsons. Buzz had served on the Frisco Independent School District school board and was known for warning the school system in the 1950s and 1960s to prepare for massive growth and the transformation of the sleepy farming town into a large suburb (his vision began to come true in the 1990s). He was often quoted as saying \\"Coit Road won't end until it reaches Oklahoma.\\" He also sponsored the area's first Little League and was a major benefactor of Future Farmers of America. In 2004 Rasor Drive, a residential street, was named in honor of the Rasor family in Frisco, Texas. John Henry Rasor is commemorated by the Rasor Elementary school in Plano.

How well it worked was to be judged by comparing the recidivism rate of subjects who received psilocybin with the average for other Concord inmates. Staff The experiment was conducted between 1961‚Äì1963 in Concord State Prison, a maximum- security prison for young offenders, in Concord, Massachusetts by a team of Harvard University researchers under the direction of Timothy Leary, which included Michael Hollingshead and Allan Cohen, Alfred Alschuder, George Litwin, Ralph Metzner, Gunther Weil, and Ralph Schwitzgebel, with Madison Presnell as the medical and psychiatric adviser. The original study involved the administration of psilocybin to assist group psychotherapy for 32 prisoners in an effort to reduce recidivism rates. Results Records at Concord State Prison suggested that 64 percent of the 32 subjects would return to prison within six months of parole. However, after six months, only 25 percent of those on parole had returned, six for technical parole violations and two for new offenses. Few short-term projects with prisoners have been effective to even a minor degree. In addition, the personality test scores indicated a measurable positive change when pre-psilocybin and post-psilocybin results were compared. Follow-up study The results of this experiment have been largely contested by a follow-up study, citing several problems including differences in the length of time after release that the study group versus the control group were compared, and other methodology factors including the difference between subjects re-incarcerated for parole violations versus imprisoned for new crimes. This study concluded that only a statistically slight improvement could be shown (as opposed to the radical improvement originally reported). In his interview within the study, Leary expressed that the major lesson of the Concord Prison experiment was that the key to a long- term reduction in overall recidivism rates might be the combination of the pre-release administration of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy with a comprehensive post-release follow-up program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous groups to offer support to the released prisoners. The study concluded that whether a new program of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy and post- release programs would significantly reduce recidivism rates is an empirical question that deserves to be addressed within the context of a new experiment.Dr. Leary's Concord Prison Experiment: A 34 Year Follow-Up Study Rick Doblin, MAPS - Volume 9 Number 4 Winter 1999/2000  Related research  Study by researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine collected data on 25,622 individuals under community corrections supervision in Treatment Accountability for Safer Communities and found that hallucinogen use predicted a reduced likelihood to fail the TASC program. Results suggest that hallucinogens may promote alcohol and other drug abstinence and prosocial behavior in a population with high rates of recidivism.Take LSD, stay out of prison?

The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales: Comprising a Registry of Armorial Bearings from the Earliest to the Present Time, 1864, page 362 Life in America Since the 1680s, New York City had had to deal with a new, nearby, maritime rival, Philadelphia, which had boomed since its founding. As added attractions, Philadelphia had \\"the purest bread and strongest beer in America.\\" Despite such appeal, the pirates preferred the safe confines of New York City and brought considerable wealth into the port of New York, whose commerce had been endangered by the fighting of King William's War. Because of these circumstances, New Yorkers, from the governor on down, willingly turned a blind eye to the obvious criminals in their midst. Most of New York City eagerly dealt with the various pirates who entered its harbor. The local merchants, along with Fletcher, saw the freebooters as men who carried real money into the impoverished colony.Philip Ranlet, \\"A Safe Haven for Witches? Colonial New York's Politics and Relations with New England in the 1690s\\" , New York History Winter-Spring 2009 (New York State Historical Association) (13 Sep. 2012). A good many of the citizens took to cheating the revenue laws by smuggling, some of them sent out ships to trade with pirates for stolen goods, and some of them fairly became pirates themselves. One of the most well-known privateers of the era was Captain William Kidd, later hanged in England after being convicted of piracy. Kidd used some of his wealth to build a fine home and helped establish the first Trinity Church. Other financiers of piracy, whose names endure in various forms around New York, were Frederick Philipse, Stephanus Van Cortlandt, Peter Schuyler and Thomas Willet. Though very strict in religious observances he was fond of luxury, and of extravagant habits, and continually in want of money. Both Fletcher and some of his council were in the habit of receiving valuable gifts‚Äîamounting to blackmail‚Äîfrom the different pirate ships.Roosevelt, Theodore: New York, VII. The Growth of the Colonial Seaport. 1691-1720 Gov. Fletcher granted \\"trading licenses to ships which everybody knew were interlopers engaged in \\"the Red Sea trade,\\" as trading with the pirates of Magagasar was politel called; privateering commissions were given to ships which everybody knew were going to sea as pirates; under his government smuggling was carried on by the leading merchants of the city and he granted the licenses and he permitted the smuggling because he was bribed\\". Fletcher had gotten payments from pirates‚Äîmostly small sums except when some grateful buccaneers gave the governor their ship, which netted him ¬£800. Edward Randolph, the Crown's agent overseeing trade, amassed evidence that doomed Fletcher's tenure and helped anoint Lord Bellomont as the new governor of New York. Fletcher returned to England, then retired to Boyle, County Roscommon in Ireland where he died on 28 May 1703. =Colonial Governor of Pennsylvania= While serving as Governor of New York, King William III appointed Fletcher as Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania, which he assumed in April 1693. William Penn was a close friend of William‚Äôs predecessor, James II and was in political trouble in England at the court at this time. King William wanted to end the pacifism in the Pennsylvania and mold the northern colonies into a unified military force for opposing the French in Canada. Fletcher was able to appoint provincial Council members and he pushed through a taxation bill (on lightly taxed Pennsylvania). However, in 1694, the Assembly reallocated a substantial portion of the tax revenue to Thomas Lloyd and William Markham (who Fletcher appointed as Deputy Governor in his absence). Fletcher then dissolved the Assembly. Eventually Penn was able to persuade King William to return the status quo in the colony of Pennsylvania (by promising to keep Fletcher‚Äôs tax law and raising a militia) and Penn reassumed his role as Proprietor. Lloyd and Markham continued in their roles as Pennsylvania‚Äôs political leaders (and render ineffective Fletcher‚Äôs tax law) with Markham being appointed as Deputy Governor under Penn. Strigham, Edward P. (editor), Anarchy and the Law: The Political Economy of Choice, Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick (2007), p.448 Legacy Fletcher's first lieutenant in New York, and possible birth son, was Peter Mathews. Mathews was at a minimum a prot√©g√©, and Fletcher may have raised him.Bayles, W. Harrison. Old Taverns of New York, 1915 Mathews named one of his children Vincent (Fletcher's mother's maiden name). Multiple children in the Mathews family carried the name Fletcher and Vincent, including Fletcher Mathews, Tory supporter during the American Revolution and brother of New York City Mayor David Mathews, and Vincent Mathews.

Many of the companies it has indirect control over are part of its largest subsidiary The Great-West Life Assurance Company; the others (Great West Life & Annuities Financial Inc and Putnam Investments, LLC) are managed by US based subsidiary Great-West Lifeco US Inc. Great-West Lifeco is indirectly controlled by Montreal billionaire Paul Desmarais through his stake in the Power Corporation of Canada (owned by the family since 1968) which owns 72% (down slightly from 74.6% in 2005) of Great-West Lifeco.

For the three months ended June 2013, 63% of revenue originated in Canada, 26% from the US, 10% from Europe. Group retirement products (Canadian sales up 49%) and 401k markets (US Great West Financial sales up 34%) remain key areas of growth for the company. Lower UK wealth management single premiums negatively affected growth. Boston-based Putnam Investments accounts for nearly a quarter of all assets under administration. Approximately half of company profit comes from Canada, a third from Europe and the rest of the United States. In the third quarter of 2010 British sales outpaced all other regions with 45% growth followed by the USA financial services business (up 41%). In 2009 100% owned subsidiary London Life ranked 14th among Canada's largest private companies. History Great- West Life was founded in Winnipeg in 1891 by a Jeffry Hall Brock, a local insurance agent. The company was incorporated on August 28, 1891, with locals such as James Ashdown on its board. It built its head office in the exchange District in Winnipeg on the corner of Rorie Street and Lombard Avenue.In 1912, two policyholders who died on the Titanic were covered by the company, after its first death payout in 1893. The earliest roots of any of the companies under its management were set in 1847 Hamilton, Ontario by subsidiary Canada Life (then known as Canada Life Assurance Company); it was later acquired by The Great-West Life Assurance Company. The original name of Canada Life included the word Assurance in place of insurance, something that was more common among British companies. Its second oldest company London Life was founded in 1874 and taken over by Great-West in 1997, one year after it purchased the Canadian operations of the Prudential Insurance Company of America When created in 1890-1891, thirty-one of the 40 insurance companies in Canada were foreign-owned and none of the Canadian-based ones were managed from Western Canada. Great-West's founder started the company as an attempt to raise capital needed locally to develop farm land and retail businesses. Great-West's first president was Winnipeg mayor Alexander Macdonald who took on that role in 1892; the founder Jeffry Hall Brock was managing director. Its first death claim was in 1893 for $1000, and in 1912 two Titanic policyholders were covered. In 1906 Great-West entered the American market starting in Fargo, North Dakota, followed by Michigan and Minnesota in 1920 and later Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Kansas, California, and Pennsylvania in the early 1940s. Within its first decade it successfully entered Eastern Canada, had market exposure in every Canadian province and became one the industry's leading companies in terms of growth and size; by 1896 it was present throughout Canada. Brock got sick and was forced to leave Great-West in 1912, three years before he died. He was succeeded as CEO by C.C. Ferguson in 1915. During the next twenty years the company's finances were negatively affected by World War I, the 1918 flu epidemic and the great depression but its market position remained strong; the stock market crash of 1929 and World War II had a positive impact on the company. The company was highly diversified, with investments spread amongst mortgages and government bonds. Great-West's early success in Western Canada was due in part to high insurance rates and a lack of financing available to farmers. In 1942, it was the first Canadian company \\"to enter the accident and health insurance business.\\" In 1960, the company moved to Osborne Street, where it had constructed on new building on the site of the old Osborne Stadium. In 1983, the company expanded again into a building on Broadway and Osborne. In 1979, US and Canadian operations became separate due mostly to rapid US growth. In 1969 Great-West was purchased by Power Corporation, which made it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, Great-West began offering a universal life policy which differed from those offered by competitors. Two years later, in 1984, the Power Financial Corporation was created to be a holding company for Great-West and its numerous businesses. In 1997, Great-West Lifeco took over London Life, acquiring Canada Life Financial in 2003. Great-West Lifeco began an acquisitions spree on February 17, 2003 when it purchased Canada Life Financial for US$4.7 billion followed by Indiana Health Network incIHN three years later in 2006 and Putnam Investment Trust on August 3, 2007 for $3.9 billion (from Marsh & McLennan Companies). On April 1, 2008 subsidiary Great- West Life & Annuity Insurance Company sold Denver based Great-West Healthcare to CIGNA for about US$1.9 billion. With the transaction Great-West Lifeco lost about 1.9 million customers (about three quarters of their medical employers). Other acquisitions include the 2006 takeover of US Bancorp's retirement plans business which added $104 billion in assets at the time and more retirement plans the same year but from MetLife. Irish Life, based in Dublin as a life assurance, pensions, and investments group, was acquired by Great West Lifeco in 2013 from the Irish government. On July 18, 2013, Canadian subsidiary Canada Life Limited completed the takeover of Irish Life Assurance. Great-West Lifeco in 2018 acquired Invesco, an Irish company. In October 2018, Stefan Kristjanson retired and was replaced by Jeff Macoun as CEO of Great-West Lifeco Inc. In January 2019, Protective Life Insurance Co. bought part of Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. for $1.2 billion. A merger of several divisions and subsidiaries to be renamed, the Canada Life amalgamation received approval from the Canadian government in November 2019. They officially begin operating as the Canada Life Assurance Company on January 1, 2020. After the merger into Canada Life, employees of the merged companies will work from company's five main offices in Winnipeg, London, Toronto, Montreal and Regina, with no cuts to employment.

To avoid confusion with dates in the Gregorian calendar, then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years. Dates in this article are in the Julian calendar unless otherwise noted.), known as The Lord Coote between 1683-89, was a member of the English Parliament and a colonial governor. Born in Ireland, he was an early supporter of William III and Mary II, siding with them in the Glorious Revolution. In 1695 he was given commissions as governor of the provinces of New York, Massachusetts Bay, and New Hampshire, which he held until his death. He did not arrive in the New World until 1698, and spent most of his tenure as governor in New York. He spent a little over a year in Massachusetts, and only two weeks in New Hampshire. His time in New York was marked by divisive politics resulting from Leisler's Rebellion (1689‚Äì91), and difficult and ultimately unsuccessful negotiations to keep the Iroquois from engaging in peace talks with New France. Frontier issues were also in the forefront during his time in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, where lumber and security from the Abenaki threat dominated his tenure. He was a major financial sponsor of William Kidd, whose privateering was later deemed to have descended into piracy. Bellomont engineered the arrest of Kidd in Boston, and had him returned to England, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged. Early life and career Richard Coote was born in Ireland in 1636. He was the second son, but the first to survive infancy, of Richard Coote, third son of Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet, and Mary, daughter of Sir George St George. His father was created Baron Coote of Coloony in 1660 (on the same day as his uncle was created Earl of Mountrath), and he succeeded his father as Baron Coote on the latter's death on 10 July 1683.De Peyster, pp. 5‚Äì6 Little is recorded of his early years.De Peyster, p. 6 In 1677 he is known to have killed a man in a duel for the affections of a young lady. He did not marry her, however, and in 1680 he married Catherine, the daughter of Bridges Nanfan and the eventual heir to Birtsmorton Court in Worcestershire.Clifford and Perry, p. 34 They had two sons.Burke, p. 135 Following the accession of the pro-Catholic James II to the English throne, Coote, a Protestant, moved to the Continent and served as a captain of horse in the Dutch army.Henning, p. 125 Because of the family's record of service to Charles II, his absence from court eventually drew the king's attention, and he was summoned back to court in 1687.De Peyster, p. 9 He was one of the first to join William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 that brought William III and Mary II to the throne. He was rewarded for this loyalty with an appointment as Treasurer to the Queen in 1689, a post he held until 1694. It also drew unfavourable attention in the Irish Parliament. That body, still under the influence of James, attainted him and seized his lands. As a result of this, William on 2 November 1689 created him Earl of Bellomont,De Peyster, p. 10 and granted him over of forfeited Irish lands. The land grant was highly controversial in Parliament, and was eventually rescinded by William.Clifford and Perry, p. 35 He was also rewarded with the governorship of County Leitrim.Wills, p. 43 Bellomont was Member of Parliament for Droitwich from 1688 to 1695. In the 1690s he became involved in the attempts by Jacob Leisler's son to clear his father's name. Leisler had been a leading force in the New York rebellion against the Dominion of New England established by King James. Upon the arrival of Henry Sloughter as governor of New York, Leisler was arrested, tried, and executed for treason, and his properties were seized. Leisler's son Jacob Jr. traveled to England to argue the case for restoration of the family properties. Bellomont sat on the Parliamentary committee that examined the evidence, and spoke in Parliament in support of the Leisler's case. He strongly stated his view that Leisler and son-in-law Jacob Milborne had been \\"barbarously murdered\\" by Sloughter's actions in a letter to Massachusetts colonial agent Increase Mather. Young Leisler's efforts were successful: Parliament voted to reverse the attainder, and ordered that the family properties be restored.Leonard, p. 152 Colonial governor The death in 1695 of Sir William Phips vacated the governorship of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Colonial agents lobbied to select either Wait Winthrop or Joseph Dudley, both native sons, to replace Phips, but the king, wanting someone who would better represent crown authority, selected Bellomont. Since William wanted someone who could exert authority over more of New England, he was also given the governorships of New Hampshire, and New York.Dunn, pp. 308‚Äì10 The major concern that Bellomont was instructed to address was ongoing problems with piracy, including the open commerce with pirates that went on in New York City and Rhode Island.Leonard, p. 153 Howard Pyle's depiction of William Kidd aboard his ship in New York Harbor Bellomont's commissions were not finalized until 1 June 1697.De Peyster, p. 24 While they were being worked on, New York colonial agent Robert Livingston proposed to Bellomont that a privateer be outfitted to combat piracy, and recommended William Kidd be its captain.De Peyster, p. 25 This scheme received the assent of King William, who issued a letter of marque to Kidd for the purpose, as well as a special commission for dealing with pirates. Bellomont raised ¬£6,000 (including ¬£1,000 of his own money, and funds from some of the Lords of the Admiralty) to outfit Kidd's ship.Leonard, p. 154 =New York= Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, accompanied by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.De Peyster, pp. 31‚Äì33 His attempts to enforce the Navigation Acts predictably turned merchants and traders against him. These attempts were also poorly executed by colonial officials whose interests lay more with those merchants than they did with the crown.Leonard, p. 155 He raised the anger of Leisler's opponents by implementing the parliamentary act he had helped pass, and saw through the restoration of Leisler's properties.De Peyster, p. 37 There was so much opposition within his council to this that he ended up purging the council of those opposed.Leonard, p. 156 Bellomont also approved the exhumation of the remains of Leisler and his son-in-law Jacob Milborne, which had been unceremoniously buried under the gallows from which they had been hanged. He sanctioned a proper burial, and provide an honour guard of 100 soldiers for the service.De Peyster, pp. 41‚Äì42 Bellomont's support of the Leislerians proved to be costly, not just in terms of New York politics, but in Indian diplomacy as well. Benjamin Fletcher, Bellomont's predecessor in office, had taken advantage of the long period between Bellomont's appointment and arrival to make some questionable land grants, including extended leases to properties normally allocated for the governor's use,De Peyster, pp. 33‚Äì35 and in territories that were still claimed by the Iroquois. When the provincial assembly passed a law retracting all of these irregular grants, it predictably angered a number of large landowners. Land grants made in Iroquois territory to Godfridius Dellius, the influential pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in Albany,Doyle, p. 309 and others were a specific subject of Iroquois complaints. Even though Bellomont's law was passed, the grantees appealed to the Board of Trade, and the bill never received royal assent.De Peyster, p. 44 Hector de Calli√®re was governor of New France while Bellomont governed New York. Bellomont denied Dellius and other anti-Leislerians positions of importance in dealing with the Iroquois, resulting in the loss of experienced negotiators.Richter, p. 192 This affected internal Iroquois politics, since supporters of interaction with the English lost influence when their English counterparts were sidelined.Richter, p. 193 This came at a particularly delicate time, when Bellomont was working to strengthen the Covenant Chain that had been neglected by Fletcher.Richter, p. 191 After the Treaty of Ryswick ended war between the French and English in 1697, the French continued to make war on the Iroquois (primarily through their Algonquian allies in the Great Lakes region), and inflicted significant casualties on them. The Iroquois sought the assistance of the English to combat this, threatening to make peace with the French if they did not receive help.Richter and Merrell, p. 52 Bellomont and French Governor General Louis-Hector de Calli√®re both claimed dominance over the Iroquois, and each refused to acknowledge the other's right to intercede on their behalf.Richter, p. 187 When Calli√®re summoned the Iroquois to Montreal for negotiations in 1699, Bellomont was alerted, and successfully manoeuvred the Iroquois into not going by sending an emissary to Montreal and troops to Albany under Lieutenant Governor Nanfan.Richter, p. 194 The English emissary was unsuccessful in swaying the French from their course of action, and French-allied Algonquians made incursions deep into Iroquois territory in 1700. In negotiations with the Iroquois, Bellomont overlooked some of the social elements that Iroquois customs demanded, with the result that the parties ended with differing views of how successful their councils were. Bellomont believed they went well, even though it was fairly clear that the Iroquois negotiators were unhappy with how the discussion had gone. He promised them the construction of a fort at Onondaga, and even convinced the legislature to appropriate ¬£1,000 for its construction, but the Iroquois were evasive on accepting this \\"gift\\", and never showed English engineers suitable locations for a fort.Richter, pp. 208‚Äì09 Bellomont's attempts to prevent the Iroquois from dealing with the French were negated by the French military successes of 1700, which brought the Iroquois to a peace council that resulted in the 1701 Great Peace of Montreal.Richter, p. 188 =Massachusetts and New Hampshire= Bellomont's Massachusetts advisor, Elisha Cooke Sr. In May 1699 Bellomont sailed for Boston.Leonard, p. 157 Bellomont spent 14 months in New England in 1699 and 1700, spending a few weeks of that time in New Hampshire and the rest in Massachusetts.Palfrey, pp. 175, 216 In Massachusetts he was treated politely, but his attempts to implement the crown's policies ran into trouble, as they had in New York. He was refused a salary by the colonial legislature, although the \\"gift\\" of ¬£1,000 he received was more than that typically given other governors of the province.Palfrey, pp. 176‚Äì77 The legislature also made repeated attempts to limit appeals to London of judicial decisions handed down by provincial courts. Bellomont, as he was required to do, forwarded laws passed by the legislature to the Board of Trade for approval; these laws were repeatedly struck down because of provisions that attempted to limit royal prerogatives.Palfrey, pp. 172‚Äì75 He also sided politically against Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton, who was an ally of Joseph Dudley, a Massachusetts native who had presided over the trial of Jacob Leisler. Instead he took council with the populist leader Elisha Cooke Sr.Palfrey, p. 171 Not long after his arrival in Boston, Bellomont engineered the arrest of William Kidd. Rumors had reached the colonies that Kidd had descended into piracy, and he came to be viewed by Bellomont and the other high-profile investors in Kidd's ship as a liability. In November 1698 the Admiralty issued orders to all colonial governors to apprehend Kidd.Zacks, p. 230 When he was informed by an agent of Kidd's in June 1699 that Kidd was in the area, Bellomont sent a message back to Kidd, promising clemency.Zacks, p. 231 Kidd responded that he would come, sending some of his treasures as a present to Lady Bellomont; she refused them.Zacks, p. 239 After Kidd's arrival in Boston on 3 July, Bellomont demanded from Kidd a written account of his travels, which Kidd, after haggling over the time, agreed to deliver on the morning of 6 July. When he did not do so, Bellomont issued a warrant for his arrest. It was executed as Kidd was en route to see Bellomont at midday the same day.Zacks, pp. 248‚Äì50 Kidd then attempted to negotiate his freedom, using the secret locations of his treasure and a captured prize ship as bargaining chips.Zacks, pp. 253-54 Although a portion of Kidd's treasure was recovered, it did not buy Kidd's freedom, and he was shipped to London in April 1700, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged.De Peyster, pp. 47‚Äì52 In contrast to the relative secrecy with which he conducted some of his communications with Kidd, Bellomont was scrupulous in his dealings with other potentially questionable merchant and pirate business, despite being offered as much as ¬£5,000 to overlook illicit activities.De Peyster, p. 51 Matters of frontier security and the lumber trade dominated his brief administration in New England.Palfrey, pp. 187, 217‚Äì18 New England was recognized as an important source of ship masts for the Royal Navy, and the Board of Trade and the Admiralty sought to reserve suitable trees for the crown's benefit. In both provinces he encountered opposition to entrenched land and timber interests that resented the intrusion of surveyors onto their lands, and interfered with their taking of lumber from lands that had not been granted and were thus reserved to the crown.Malone, pp. 17‚Äì20 In New Hampshire the timber dispute was overlaid by ongoing disputes between local landowners and Samuel Allen, a London merchant who had acquired the territorial claims of the heirs of John Mason, the province's founder, and was pursuing them against those landowners. Allen, who had been commissioned governor of the province in 1692,American Quarterly Register, p. 272 only came to the colony in 1698 to take a direct interest in its affairs. During Bellomont's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.Doyle, p. 332Palfrey, pp. 215‚Äì17 =Abenaki relations= 18th century depiction of an Abenaki couple The frontier situation that Bellomont encountered during his time in Massachusetts and New Hampshire was somewhat tense, because the Abenaki of northern New England (like the Iroquois in New York) had not been involved in the Treaty of Ryswick that ended King William's War. In the aftermath of the war they and the settlers of Maine and New Hampshire were extremely mistrustful of one another.Morrison, pp. 142‚Äì43 The Abenaki felt threatened by English encroachment on their lands, and the settlers feared a return to significant French-inspired raiding of their settlements. Bellomont issued proclamations to distribute among the Abenaki denying plans to take their lands, but was unable to ease the underlying tensions.Morrison, p. 147 One reason for this was his naive assumption that Abenaki concerns were rooted in a French Catholic conspiracy. When English negotiators attempted to separate the Abenaki from their Jesuit missionaries, this upset ongoing trade negotiations, and did nothing to assuage Puritan New England concerns over the activities of \\"Popish Emissaries\\" intriguing to make war on them.Morrison, pp. 148‚Äì51 The colonial legislature passed a law banning Roman Catholics from territory claimed by the province, which included Abenaki territory claimed by Governor Sir William Phips in 1693.Morrison, p. 149 Bellomont engaged in fruitless attempts to convince the eastern Abenaki to migrate west, where they would come under Iroquois influence; this was unsuccessful, in part because the Abenaki and Iroquois had a history of conflict.Morrison, p. 142 Despite these difficulties, he managed to achieve a precarious peace with the Abenaki in January 1699.Morrison, p. 143 Abenaki relations were also complicated by misunderstandings about sovereignty. The Abenaki viewed themselves as sovereign, while the English believed them to be subjects, either to themselves or to the French. A prisoner exchange involving English held by the Abenaki and Indians held by the English was frustrated when Bellomont believed that it would be sufficient to negotiate with his counterpart in Quebec to obtain the release of the English prisoners. Return to New York and death He returned to New York in 1700, where he resumed actions against piracy and illegal shipping. Following a conference with the Iroquois at Albany in early 1700/1 (which Bellomont characterized as \\"greatest fatigue [I] ever underwent\\"), he returned to New York City,Richter, p. 207 where he succumbed to a severe case of gout on 5 March 1700/01. He was buried in the chapel of Fort William. When the fort was dismantled, his remains were moved to the yard of St. Paul's Chapel.De Peyster, p. 57 St. Paul's Chapel yard, location of Bellomont's grave Lieutenant Governor Nanfan acted as New York's governor until the arrival of Lord Cornbury in 1702.Bonomi, p. 59 Nanfan, during his brief tenure, reached the peace agreement that eluded Bellomont. In an agreement negotiated later in 1701, the Iroquois signed an agreement putting their westernmost territorial claims (spanning from present-day Erie, Pennsylvania to Chicago and northern Michigan) under the English crown's protection.Richter, p. 212 Family, titles, and legacy Bellomont's eldest son, Nanfan, Lord Coloony, succeeded to the earldom on his death. His second son Richard, succeeded in turn as 3rd earl on his elder brother's death. On the 3rd earl's death without surviving male heirs, the earldom became extinct, while the barony devolved on his cousin, Sir Charles Coote, who was later also created Earl of Bellomont. He died without male issue, and all of the titles were then extinguished. Bellomont's rule in New York was not remembered fondly. One political opponent, noting that the provincial debt rose substantially during his tenure, wrote that the memory of Bellomont \\"will stink in the nostrills of all good men\\",Bonomi, p. 90 and Robert Livingston reported that the debt was \\"a greater Debt than I had ever seen\\".Bonomi, p. 91 Bellomont's personal affairs were also difficult to tie up: his creditors tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent his wife's departure from the province in order to compel settlement of his personal debts. Bellomont's financial issues were not unique in this respect. Later governors (including Nanfan and Cornbury) were arrested on charges of malfeasance and personal indebtedness at the behest of their political opponents. New York's debt problems were not resolved until the Hunter administration in 1717.

Biography Hunter was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1666, grandson of the twentieth Laird of Hunterston in Ayrshire, being the son of lawyer James Hunter and his wife Margaret Spalding. Hunter had been apprenticed to an apothecary before running away to join the British Army. He became an officer in 1689 who rose to become a general, and married a woman of high rank. He was a man of business whose first address to the New Jersey Assembly was barely 300 words long. In it, he stated, \\"If honesty is the best policy, plainness must be the best oratory.\\" He was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 1707, but was captured by a corsair on his way to Virginia, taken to France, and in 1709 exchanged for the French Bishop of Quebec. He was then appointed Governor of New York and sailed to America with 3,000 Palatine refugees as settlers in 1710. In 1715 he advocated the local minting of copper coins, but the king refused. Governor Hunter's philosophy was that \\"the true Interests of the People and Government are the same, I mean A Government of Laws. No other deserves the Name, and are never Separated or Separable but in Imagination by Men of Craft.\\" Hunter was succeeded as Governor by Pieter Schuyler as acting governor from 1719 to 1720 and finally by William Burnet, whose post as Comptroller of Customs was given to Hunter in exchange. Hunter was then Governor of Jamaica from 1727 until his death on 31 March 1734. While in Jamaica, Hunter waged an unsuccessful war against the Jamaican Maroons. He was a member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May,1709.

He has worked alongside critically acclaimed queer artists including Diane DiMassa and Alison Bechdel.  Background  Robert Kirby was born in Detroit, Michigan in September 1962. He lived in Manhattan, New York City, New York for a while, during which he worked on Curbside Boys: The New York Years. He attended the University of Minnesota. Kirby has been publishing comics since Strange Looking Exile, a zine published in the early 1990s, and grew popular through his long-running comic Curbside Boys. Kirby was married in October 2013, after same sex marriage was legalized in Minnesota in May of that same year. Kirby currently lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota with his spouse, John, and continues to write and review comics. Career Robert Kirby has been interested in comics since he was a child, and drew influence from artists like Charles Schulz. Kirby had his first venture into producing comics with the comic zine Strange Looking Exile, which also featured work by Diane DiMassa, Roberta Gregory, Nick Leonard and Alison Bechdel. The zine ran from 1991 until 1994. Following that, Kirby began producing a new comic zine called Boy Trouble with co-editor David Kelly, a comics anthology that was published four issues as a zine, followed by a book in 2004. Boy Trouble features contributions and collaborations from the editors as well as a number of other artists and writers including Anonymous Boy, Craig Bostick, Jennifer Camper, C. Bard Cole, Michael Fahy, Tim Fish, Leanne Franson, Andy Hartzell, G.B. Jones, Steve MacIsaac, Sina Shamsavari, Ivan Velez Jr. and others. In 2002, State Representative Nancy Sheltra (R-Derby) protested the presence of the publication Out In The Mountains in the Vermont Statehouse due to its inclusion of Kirby's strip featuring two bare-chested male cartoon characters kissing, which she deemed \\"pornographic\\". In 2006, an anthology of the best of Boy Trouble was released, entitled The Book of Boy Trouble, which also included new work and work in color. Besides the editors, Kirby and Kelly, the book featured sequential art by Anonymous Boy, Craig Bostick, C. Bard Cole, Jaime Cortez, Michael Fahy, Justin Hall, Andy Hartzell, Victor Hodge, Brett Hopkins, Nick Leonard, Steve MacIsaac, Josue Menjivar, Sina Shamsavari, D. Travers Scott, and Russ Turk. This work had comics that focused on topics including love, sex, and punk rock, among other things. In 2008, The Book of Boy Trouble Volume 2: Born to Trouble was published, featured work by many of the artists from the first volume as well as work by Jennifer Camper, Derek Charm, Howard Cruse, Abby Denson, Tim Fish, Joan Hilty, G.B. Jones, Nick Leonard, Ed Luce, Jon Macy, Steve MacIsaac, Dave Ortega, Bill Roundy, and Robert Triptow. Kirby was also a regular contributor to the ongoing queer comics anthology Juicy Mother, edited by Jennifer Camper, and released in 2005 and 2007. In 2010 Robert Kirby began his ongoing LGBT comics anthology, THREE, and in 2014 his 33-person anthology QU33R was published by Northwest Press. As of November 2019, Kirby is still active in the comics sphere, writing comics as well as reviewing comics.  Curbside Boys  Curbside is the story of two young men: Drew, an aspiring writer, and Nathan, an aspiring musician, who meet and eventually form a tumultuous relationship. The comic was syndicated in several periodicals, including Chicago Nightlines, Out In The Mountains, Lavender Magazine and others, as well as on the internet. The series has also been collected into two books. The first book published with the aid of a Xeric Foundation grant. A translation into Spanish has also been published. Curbside Boys, the sequel to Kirby's first book Curbside, went out of print in 2013, however it is still available to read online.  Boy Trouble  Boy Trouble is a zine by Robert Kirby and David Kelly that was made in order to highlight some queer comics. Four issues were published since 1994. A fifth issue was published in 2004. The Book of Boy Trouble, an anthology of these zines, was published in 2006, followed by The Book of Boy Trouble 2: Born to Trouble in 2008.  Current Works  Robert Kirby is currently working on a graphic memoir called Marry Me a Little, which explores marriage as a middle aged gay man. It also discusses the legalization of gay marriage in Minnesota (where Kirby and his husband live) in May 2013. Marry Me a Little was originally published in PEN America in June 2018. It also appears on his personal website. He hopes to complete the work by the end of 2021. He also reviews comics for The Comics Journal, and has done several of them, including one of the anthology Drawing Power, edited by Diane Noomin. He has also been published in Panel Patter, Rain Taxi, and other publications for his reviews and comics.  Awards and Recognition  In 1997, Kirby was awarded a Xeric Grant, given by the Xeric Foundation to comics artists for self-publishing their work. Kirby used this grant in publishing his first book, Curbside. In 2006, Kirby's The Book of Boy Trouble was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the \\"Arts and Culture\\" section. His anthology THREE was nominated for two Ignatz awards and received a Prism Comics Queer Press Grant in 2011. In 2014, his anthology QU33R was published and won the Ignatz Award for Outstanding Anthology or Collection.

Life Montgomerie was born in the parish of Beith in Scotland. His father, Francis Montgomerie, was a member of the Privy Council under William III and Mary II and Queen Anne, and lord of Castle Giffen in Beith. When John Montgomerie married, his father gave him the estate at Hessilhead, which was auctioned off in 1722 to pay off accumulated debts. Montgomerie served in the 3rd Foot Guards, and was elected to Parliament for Ayrshire between 1710 and 1722. When George II ascended the throne in 1727 he rewarded Montgomerie for his service with the governorship of New York and New Jersey, a position Montgomerie may have sought on account of his financial difficulties. During Montgomerie's term in New York he presided over the issuance of what became known as the Montgomerie Charter for New York City. This served as the city's governing charter for more than a century, even though it was never formally approved by the crown. The city appropriated a sum of ¬£1,000 at the times which may have served as a bribe to various colonial officials, including Montgomerie. His tenure in office saw the city's export exceed those of Boston and Philadelphia, which had until then been the major trade centers in the North American colonies. He also oversaw the final agreement of the borders between New York and the neighboring Connecticut Colony. Montgomerie served as governor until 1 July 1731, when he died of an epileptic seizure.New York Burning, Jill Lepore, p. 25 He was replaced on an acting basis by Rip Van Dam in New York and Lewis Morris in New Jersey, who served until his official replacement, William Cosby, arrived to assume the office.

During his short term as governor, Cosby was portrayed as one of the most oppressive royal placeholders in British Colonial America. In 1735, Cosby accused publisher John Peter Zenger of sedition and libel for publishing unflattering reports about Cosby. In spite of Cosby's efforts, Zenger was acquitted of all charges and the case helped to establish the concept of freedom of the press. Early life and military career William Cosby was born in Stradbally Hall, Queen's County, Ireland, in 1690. His father, Alexander Cosby of Stradbally, stemmed from a British family that settled in Ireland in 1590, by the first Alexander Cosby. His mother, Elizabeth L'Estrange, was from another family of the Protestant Ascendancy. In 1709, 19-year-old William Cosby travelled to Italy and earned money by gambling in card games. The next year he enlisted in the British Army at Spain, under General Stanhope's command. In successive years, his military career progressed: cornet of the 5th Dragoon Guards (24 August 1705), captain of the 2nd Dragoon Guards, Harvey's Regiment of Horse (15 April 1711) and colonel of the Royal Regiment of Ireland (24 December 1717 to 1732). In 1711, Cosby married Grace Montagu, a lady with connections at the British court as a sister of George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax.Patrick Cracroft- Brennan, Manchester, Earl of (E, 1625/6) in Cracroft's Peerage. Accessed 5 December 2012. They had five children: William (1713), Grace (1716), Elizabeth (1721), Grace (1723) and Henry (1719). All of them were born in Britain, most within the City and Liberty of Westminster. Both sons followed careers in the military afterwards. A third son, Alexander, born 1717, is not recorded as a son of William in contemporary documents but was a son of Grace. Cosby had a home in Soho Square and one in St. Leonard's Hill (near the town of Windsor). Balearic Islands In 1717, Cosby was promoted to Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Ireland. The next year, this regiment was transferred to Menorca, in the Balearic Islands. Cosby acted as governor of Menorca from 1718. His administration was unremarkable in most respects, but he ran into difficulties when he illegally seized a Portuguese ship and attempted to appropriate its valuable cargo of snuff for his own benefit.Robert E. Cray, \\"William Cosby,\\" in American National Biography. Governor of New York and New Jersey Manhattan Island in 1731 When George II of Britain was crowned, he transferred New York's Royal Governor William Burnet to be the Royal Governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Burnet's successor, John Montgomerie, died soon after taking office. On 13 January 1732, George II appointed Cosby as \\"Captain General & Governor in Chief of the Provinces of New York, New Jersey and Territories depending thereon in America\\". The interim governor, who would serve until Cosby arrived in America, was Rip Van Dam. Cosby arrived in New York City on 24 April 1732, bringing his wife, two of his daughters, and one of his sons. He assumed office on 7 August. At the time, the colony of New York had 50,000 inhabitants, and the city only 9,000, but its port activity was booming with docks and shipyards. =Cosby's manor= King George II gave Cosby a land grant on 2 January 1734, of 22,000 acres on the Mohawk River, in what became Herkimer County, New York, and named Cosby's Manor later (19 February 1736). The grant, sold in 1772 to Philip Schuyler and four other proprietors, included the later sites of Utica and Schuyler, New York. Cosby was promoted to vice admiral on 29 September 1735, and to brigadier general on 30 November 1735, while serving as royal governor. =Salary disputes= The salaries of British colonial governors were always a contentious issue in eighteenth-century British America. When Cosby arrived in New York, he demanded that the acting governor, Van Dam, turn over half the salary he had received during his term to Cosby. Van Dam replied that he would not do so unless Cosby turned over half of the (presumably much larger) fees he had reaped from the office while in England. Cosby responded by taking Van Dam to court. Moreover, he insisted that the court proceed through equity jurisdiction, thus obviating the need for a jury. Equity proceedings were extremely unpopular in colonial America, especially if the equity courts were constituted without the colonial legislature's consent. Colonists saw them as a form of tyranny. Chief Justice Lewis Morris, aware of public opinion, dismissed Cosby's case on legal grounds on 9 April 1733. Cosby retaliated by removing Morris from office. He also dismissed Van Dam from the provincial council and named loyalist James De Lancey the new chief justice. Afterwards, Morris justified his decision in The New York Weekly Journal, an opposition newspaper. This episode was significant both because it was the precursor to the Zenger trial and because it augmented Cosby's reputation for arbitrary, tyrannical rule.Michael Kammen, Colonial New York: A History, New York: Oxford University Press, 1975 Meanwhile, Cosby secured an adequate salary for himself by refusing to call for new elections to the New York General Assembly. The grateful assemblymen willingly voted him five years of support. =Court Party vs Country Party= As a direct consequence of the removal of Lewis Morris, two political forces were consolidated: *The court party or Tory faction. Its partisans included Adolphe Philipse, son of Frederick Philipse I of Philipse Manor, and Philip Van Cortlandt, son of Stephanus Van Cortlandt who was a father-in-law of Frederick Philipse I. This faction was led by De Lancey. *The country party, or Morrisites. Its partisans included Lewis Morris, Rip Van Dam, James Alexander, William Smith (a lawyer disbarred by Cosby from the government), and others. While these two parties did not include the whole of colonial New York's political spectrum, the conflict between them became one of the central axes of New York political life. Both parties were dominated by wealthy, land-owning clans, but the court party was more cosmopolitan than the country party, which focused on provincial economic development. In 1735-1736, Morris visited London to plead his case directly to the crown. He failed either to secure Cosby's dismissal as governor or to secure his own reappointment as chief justice.Eugene R. Sheridan, \\"Lewis Morris,\\" American National Biography. Nevertheless, Morris was ultimately appointed governor of New Jersey. In New York, the Septennial Act of 1743 ensured that assembly elections would henceforth be held at regular intervals, no less than once every seven years. =Hopewell encroaching= As royal governor, Cosby illegally seized lands owned by colonists in Hopewell, New Jersey, awarding them to his royalist allies, Dr Daniel Coxe and his son. Cosby pushed out the settlers, forcing them to repurchase their properties, and then, as supreme judicial official of the colony, rejected the popular pleas led by Lewis Morris. Before leaving for North Carolina, the former settlers retaliated. Armed with tar and feathers, they attacked the new householders and many government functionaries. Cosby's subsequent official proclamation stated that \\"...he or they may be brought to condign Punishment... (so) I do hereby promise to Pay to the Discovered the Sum of Thirty Pounds Proclamation Money...(as reward)\\" (1735). =Native American relations= Ensconced in his own world of increasing self-wealth and political repression, Cosby neglected his duties in frontier affairs. Military expeditions were easily defeated by Chickasaws, Catawbas, and Cherokees. The Iroquois tribes benefited from Cosby's dereliction, reorganising their Six Nations confederation as a powerful military threat. =Lifelong rewards struggle= During Cosby's term in office, he granted \\"extraordinary salaries\\", either lifelong or for a stated term of years, to government officers or fellow royalists as rewards for loyal service. His authority to do so was limited by the general assembly. Those salaries were often cancelled as a result of the festering rivalry between the court and country parties. Zenger case The New York Weekly Journal was an opposition newspaper, pro-colonist and anti-royal, supported financially by the Morrisites. It was founded in 1733 by John Peter Zenger, a German immigrant. Its mordant editorials were mainly written by socially notorious people, Morrisites like James Alexander, who published anonymously. Its most controversial editorials were about: *Morris's deposition *Cosby's attempt to rig the 1734 elections *Post-electoral satiric ballads, where royalist partisans were \\"petty fogging knaves\\" and the popular partisans would \\"make the scoundrel rascals fly\\" *Cosby's stealing collected taxes *Cosby's appropriation of Indian lands *Official permission to French ships docking in New York's harbor In November 1734, Cosby ordered his men to burn up four of its editions‚Äî7, 47, 48, 49‚Äîdown at the pillory. Those allegedly contained seditious material. On 17 November, Zenger was arrested for seditious libel against Cosby. His arrest did not close the Journal. His wife, Anna, continued printing the newspaper. Zenger's trial Working through De Lancey, Cosby disbarred Zenger's local defenders, urging the jury to punish him. But the Morrisites hired Andrew Hamilton, a celebrated lawyer from Philadelphia, as Zenger's attorney. Hamilton argued that the newspaper could not be punished unless what it had printed was falsely seditious. The principle he proclaimed still stands in modern United States law: libel only exists when falsehoods are perpetrated. Zenger was acquitted by the jury on 18 August 1735. De Lancey declined to reverse that decision. Although the Zenger case did not entirely put an end to prosecutions for seditious libel, it set a precedent for freedom of the press. Death Cosby died of tuberculosis on 10 March 1736, between 1 and 2 pm, in the Governor's House at Ft. George, today's Battery Park, New York City. First, he was buried in a vault at Ft. George's chapel (1736). But in 1788, his remains were moved to an unmarked grave at St Paul Church's Cemetery, New York, together with the remains of the Earl of Bellomont, who served as New York governor between 1698 and 1701. George Clarke, the sitting lieutenant governor, assumed Cosby's office. He was a moderate loyalist of the Court Party, a former representative in the Provincial Council. He frustrated Van Dam's aspirations again, starting another political scandal. Nonetheless, Clarke received royal confirmation officially. Legacy Eighteenth-century observers believed that Governor William Cosby was motivated by two goals: defending British interests and building his private fortune. Royal governors in British North America were seldom popular, but to some colonists, Cosby became a symbol of just how oppressive a royal governor could be. Cosby's political opponent Lewis Morris characterised Cosby's governorship as a reign of \\"a God damn ye,\\" underlining Cosby's indifference to the wishes and welfare of those he governed. Although Cosby's governorship was not a rewarding period for colonial New York, the struggles of the 1730s ultimately helped define the roles of the royal governor, the assembly, and the courts in provincial politics. They also fostered the development of the colony's first political parties. Historian Michael Kammen characterises Cosby's era as a period of \\"political awakening and modernization\\" in New York politics. Once the structural problems were addressed, politicians could turn their attention to the substantive issues and engage a larger portion of the population in political activity.

Clarke then held the post of Lieutenant Governor until 1747. In 1741, Clarke was marginally involved in the suppression of the New York Conspiracy of 1741, a plot much-disputed by historians on the part of African slaves and poor white settlers to overthrow the colonial government by setting fires in New York City in March 1741.

She was sunk as a target in 1998. History The first was named for Commodore Oscar C. Badger (a cousin of Secretary of the Navy George Edmund Badger), the father of Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger, the son of the commodore and the father of the admiral, was also honored by the naming of the destroyer (q.v.), and the grandfather of Admiral Oscar C. Badger. This Badger (FF-1071) honors all four men. = Commissioning = Badger was laid down on 17 February 1968 at Todd Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California; launched on 7 December 1968; sponsored by Mrs. Oscar C. Badger; and commissioned at Long Beach, California, on 1 December 1970, Commander William L. Britton in command. Badger completed fitting out at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in January 1971 and then spent most of the spring engaged in tests and shakedown training. She completed final contract trials in May, during which Badger set the speed record for Knox class frigates, over 30 knots. The following month, entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for post- shakedown availability. During that availability, she received extensive modifications including the addition of a basic point defense missile system (BPDMS) and of an independent variable depth sonar system. Because of those changes, Badger underwent a post-shakedown availability that lasted until mid- November. From that time until mid-March 1972, the destroyer escort conducted a series of underway tests and training evolutions and underwent readiness inspections. On 16 March 1972, she weighed anchor and stood out of Long Beach on her way to the Far East. Along the way, Badger stopped at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam before arriving in Subic Bay on 7 April. = 1970s = On the following evening, Badger stood out of Subic bound for the Vietnam War zone. She arrived in Danang, South Vietnam, two days later and, after a four-hour layover, again got underway, bound for the northern gunline near the mouth of the Cua Viet River. She began gunfire support missions on the 11th and, on the 13th, received her first counterbattery fire. Two days later, she suffered superficial damage from a communist shore battery after her had been put out of action by a fouled bore and an overheated barrel. Later that day, the ship headed back to Danang to have her 5-inch gun barrel replaced by the repair ship . She returned to sea on the 16th and soon arrived back on the gunline. On the 19th, Badger was switched to plane guard duty for the aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Tonkin. That assignment lasted two days short of a month. On 17 May, destroyer escort relieved her, and Badger shaped a course for Sasebo, Japan.  1972  Following a week of availability and liberty, Badger departed Sasebo on 29 May 1972 and, on 2 June, joined guided missile cruiser on the middle sea-air rescue (SAR) station in the Gulf of Tonkin. Four days later, however, she was reassigned to plane guard duty, this time for the ASW support carrier . After spending 20 days supporting the carrier, Badger returned to gunfire support missions on 26 June. On 7 July, the warship resumed plane guard duties, this time for the carrier , and departed Vietnamese waters in company with that carrier. The following day, the ships moored in Subic Bay. Following upkeep, Badger headed back to the combat zone on 17 July 1972. Two days later, she resumed gunfire support duties. During that assignment, the ocean escort joined five other American ships in providing gunfire support for operations carried out in Military Region II by the South Vietnamese Army's 22d Division. On 9 August, she was assigned duty interdicting communist waterborne logistics and remained so engaged until 12 August when she relieved guided missile frigate as plane guard for Midway, once again headed for Subic Bay. The two ships reached their destination on 14 August but departed again the next day bound for Hong Kong. Badger conducted an upkeep and liberty period at that port from 17 to 23 August and got underway on the latter day to return to the Philippines. She arrived in Subic Bay on 24 August for repairs before putting to sea on the 30th, bound for Vietnamese waters. Upon her return to the combat zone, the warship took up position as escort for the guided missile cruiser on the middle SAR station. During that tour of duty, she also kept an eye on two Chinese merchantmen in the area. When the guided missile frigate relieved Long Beach, Badger continued on station until 10 September, when she was relieved of middle SAR station escort duties by her sister ship and proceeded to rendezvous with the carrier . Badger provided plane guard services for the carrier as she made her final air strikes of the war and then escorted Hancock to Subic Bay, arriving there on 15 September. After four days in port, the destroyer escort put to sea and shaped a course for Yokosuka, Japan, where she made an overnight stop on 22 and 23 September before setting sail for the United States in company with Hancock. After a nonstop voyage across the Pacific, highlighted by several fueling-at-sea operations, Badger arrived back in Long Beach on 4 October. The usual post-deployment stand-down ensued as did a restricted availability at the Todd Shipyard in Los Angeles, California. The latter began on 8 January 1973 and included the conversion of her main propulsion system to Navy distillate fuel and the installation of a light airborne multipurpose system (LAMPS).  1973‚Äì1975  Badger completed those modifications on 18 May 1973 and put to sea for trials and single ship exercises in the southern California operating area. Normal west coast operations out of Long Beach occupied her time until 9 July, the day she got underway for her new home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The warship made the voyage in six days, entering Pearl on 14 July. Training in the Hawaiian operating area occupied her until early September. On 11 September, Badger put to sea to participate in the four-nation Exercise RIMPAC '73. However, a material casualty to her evaporators forced her to return to port for repairs on the 15th. She was back at sea the following afternoon; rejoined the exercise; and, following its conclusion, returned to Pearl on 21 September. Three days later, she set sail for Long Beach and arrived there on 1 October. The ship's crew then enjoyed a 16-day liberty call before the ship began her second deployment on the 17th. Badger rendezvoused with the carrier to form Task Group (TG) 37.4, and the two ships then shaped a course for the western Pacific. Augmented en route by the remainder of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 35, TG 37.4 reached Subic on 5 November 1973. On the 9th, Badger departed Subic Bay in company with destroyer escort and ammunition ship bound for the Persian Gulf and the CENTO Exercise MIDLINK '73. On the way, the ships stopped at Singapore. They arrived at Bandar Abbas, Iran, on the 23d. From that port, she participated in MIDLINK '73 until its conclusion on 2 December. After a brief liberty call at Bandar Abbas, Badger got underway on the 3rd to return to the Philippines, again in company with Brewton and Kiska. The voyage included another visit to Singapore, and Badger reentered Subic Bay on 21 December 1973. She immediately began a repair and upkeep period that lasted until 20 January 1974, when she headed for Guam. Four days later, the destroyer escort arrived at Guam whence she conducted special operations. Badger remained in the Mariana Islands until 13 February when she departed Guam to return to Subic Bay. The warship steamed into that port on 17 February and, for the next month, conducted training operations in local waters. On 18 March 1974, Badger put to sea from Subic Bay for a series of port calls beginning with a stop at Hong Kong from 21 March to 1 April. From there, she moved to Keelung, Taiwan, for a visit between 3 and 8 April. On the 9th, she moored in the harbor at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for an eight-day stay before returning to Subic on the 18th. From 22 to 27 April, she operated in the South China Sea shadowing two Soviet submarines. She returned to Subic on the 27th and remained there until 5 May when the destroyer escort began the voyage back home to Hawaii. After a stop at Guam, she reached Pearl Harbor on 18 May. Following leave and upkeep, Badger got underway for tests on her main propulsion plant and associated equipment on 21 June 1974. She returned to Pearl that night and remained in port until returning to sea on 11 July for final tests. During the full power run, the ship suffered a casualty to her low pressure turbine and was taken in tow by the large harbor tug . Later, relieved Waxahachie and pulled the stricken destroyer escort into Pearl Harbor on the morning of the 12th. The warship underwent a restricted availability at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard lasting until late October and resumed normal operations in the Hawaiian Operating Area in November. That employment occupied her for the last two months of 1974 and for the first two months of 1975. On 11 March 1975, she put to sea to participate in Exercise RIMPAC '75, the multifaceted combat readiness exercise that brought together units of the American, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand navies. The exercise concluded on 21 March, and Badger returned to Pearl Harbor to prepare for overseas movement. Badger being refueled by the carrier Midway in the South China Sea in 1975. Badger put to sea on 17 April to rendezvous with sister ship and guided missile destroyer escort , and Kiska for the voyage to the western Pacific. The task group stopped at Guam for fuel on 28 April but, immediately after completing the operation, continued on to Subic Bay where, after a short diversion to the South China Sea to assist in the evacuation of Vietnam, they arrived on 4 May. The next day, Badger was back at sea escorting Midway to Guam with a load of American aircraft removed from Vietnam. The two warships arrived there on 11 May, unloaded the planes, and returned to sea on the 12th. En route back to Subic Bay, she received orders diverting her to assist in the recovery of the American container ship SS Mayag√ºez that had been seized by the Cambodians. The merchantman, however, was freed before Badgers arrival on the scene, and the escort resumed her original course and reentered Subic Bay on the 17th. She spent two days escorting Hancock in the local operating area before returning to port on 22 May. After a week of upkeep, she put to sea for Guam. Arriving in Apra Harbor on 2 June to begin another period of upkeep, she remained there until 13 June when she put to sea for special operations in company with Brewton. Badger returned to Guam on 22 June, spent three days there, and headed back to Subic Bay on the 25th. On the last day of the month, she put to sea as a unit of TG 75.1 to begin a 60-day training cruise to the Indian Ocean. One day out, on 1 July 1975, Badger was reclassified a frigate and redesignated FF-1071. That extended voyage brought exercises of all types: refueling, replenishment, towing, communications, gunnery, and engineering. She also made port calls at Singapore, Port Louis in Mauritius, Mombasa in Kenya, Karachi in Pakistan, and Colombo in Sri Lanka. The ship concluded that voyage at Subic Bay on 11 September. Upkeep there, including a period in drydock, lasted until 29 September. On 1 October, Badger headed to Hong Kong. She arrived there on 3 October and with the exception of two days at sea from 5 to 7 October to evade a typhoon, remained in port until the 9th when she shaped a course for Guam. The warship arrived there on 15 October for two weeks of upkeep and operations locally for sea trials. On 29 October. She set a course for Pearl Harbor and pulled into her home port on 8 November. Her post-deployment standdown period was followed, in turn, by a holiday leave and upkeep period.  1976‚Äì1979  During the first five months of 1976, Badger alternated training operations at sea with periods in port at Pearl Harbor preparing for her first regular overhaul. Late in May, the crew moved off the ship to quarters ashore; and, on 7 June, the ship officially commenced overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. This work occupied her for the remainder of 1976 and through the first few days of 1977. She emerged from the yard on 11 January 1977 and conducted sea trials the following day. Further trials, inspections, and readiness ensued. In July, she began refresher training that lasted until the first week in August when she returned to Pearl Harbor. Badger got underway for the west coast of the United States in company with DesRon 23 on 22 August 1977. Throughout the passage across the eastern Pacific, she joined the ships of DesRon 23 in a number of exercises. She arrived in San Diego, California, on the last day of August and remained in port until 9 September at which time she put to sea to participate in local operations with San Diego-based units of the Fleet. Badger returned to San Diego on the 15th and stayed until the 19th when she returned to sea for Exercise Varsity Spirit conducted along the California coast. At the conclusion of that exercise, she headed back to Pearl where she arrived on 1 October and began preparations for overseas movement. On 2 November 1977, Badger departed Pearl Harbor in company with and the other units of DesRon 25 bound for the western Pacific. The warships arrived in Yokosuka exactly three weeks later after an exercise-filled passage. Throughout that deployment, she conducted exercises with units of Allied navies as well as with 7th Fleet units. She also made goodwill visits to Singapore and various Japanese and Korean ports. The frigate also frequently called at Subic Bay for upkeep and replenishment. She concluded the deployment at Pearl on 8 May 1978. Post- deployment standdown lasted until mid-June at which time she resumed local operations in the Hawaiian Islands. Badger spent the next nine months engaged in exercises and drills conducted out of Pearl Harbor. On 17 March 1979, the warship departed her home port in company with Brewton, , , and , bound for another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. After pausing at Guam for fuel on 29 March, the warships pulled into Subic Bay on 4 April and spent the rest of the month alternating exercises in the local operating area with periods of upkeep in port. During the first half of May, she joined Brewton and Rathburne in a round-trip voyage to Hong Kong for a goodwill and liberty call. Late in May and early in June, Badger operated with a task group in the South China Sea before returning to Subic Bay on the 11th. With the exception of a three-day period at sea in the local operating area, she spent the remainder of June in upkeep and preparations for an extended cruise to the Indian Ocean. Badger departed Subic Bay on 1 July 1979 in company with Brewton, Rathburne, and USNS Mispillion. The task group stopped at Singapore for a four-day port visit before transiting the Strait of Malacca on 8 July and entering the Indian Ocean, where intensive exercises and drills in all facets of ship's operations highlighted periods at sea punctuated by visits to Colombo, Sri Lanka, and Mombasa. The latter stages of the operation were conducted in the Gulf of Aden and in the Gulf of Oman. The task group exited the Indian Ocean via the Strait of Malacca on 29 August and headed for the Gulf of Siam where it joined units of the Thai Navy for Exercise Sea Siamex X. At the conclusion of that exercise on 7 September, the ships made a four-day visit to Pattaya Beach, Thailand, before shaping a course for the Philippines. En route, Badger was detached from the task group to proceed to Luzon independently. However, before reaching port, she was further diverted on a humanitarian mission: the rescue of 14 Vietnamese refugees adrift in a small boat. She finally arrived in Subic Bay on 15 September, all refugees safe. = 1980s = Harpoon anti-shipping missile in 1980. Badger remained at Subic less than a week; she got underway on the 21st, bound for Hawaii in company with Brewton and Rathburne. They stopped for fuel at Guam and Midway before arriving back in Pearl Harbor on 4 October. Following post-deployment standdown, the frigate resumed local operations out of Pearl late in December. On 7 January 1980, Badger began a seven-week availability at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Her repairs were completed on 27 February, and she began sea trials in the local area. Over the next six months, Badger went through the usual trials and certifications as well as all types of exercises and drills. In mid-August, she began pre- deployment training with a carrier task group formed around . That training complete, the task group returned to Pearl Harbor on 23 September for a final liberty call before heading for the Far East. On 26 September, Badger departed Pearl Harbor in company with the Ranger task group bound for an extended assignment with the 7th Fleet. The warships entered Subic Bay on 15 October, and Badger began a 10-day availability. Late in the evening of the 26th, she put to sea to rendezvous with the rest of the Ranger task group. On 30 October, the ships began the transit of the Strait of Malacca and, the next day, entered the Indian Ocean, the appearance of this task group in the Indian Ocean reflecting the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants almost a year before and the holding of embassy personnel as hostages. Though the task group never entered the Persian Gulf, its training evolutions kept it within rapid steaming time of that troubled area. Badger and the task group remained in the Indian Ocean through the end of the year and into 1981 conducting intensive training of all types including multilateral exercises with Allied navies.  1981‚Äì83  Iran's release of the American hostages occurred on 19 January 1981, but Badger and the task group to which she was assigned, continued training evolutions in the Indian Ocean for eight weeks thereafter. On 11 March, group retransited the Strait of Malacca and left the Indian Ocean behind. The warships reentered Subic Bay on 23 March, and Badger began a 12-day upkeep. Just under a month later on 16 April, the Ranger task group put to sea to return to Hawaii. After 12 days at sea, the frigate reentered her home port on 28 April. During the month of May, the warship combined the customary post-deployment standdown period with preparations for the periodic visit by the inspection and survey team. After the team's visit early in June, Badger resumed normal training duty in the Hawaiian operating area. That employment lasted through the summer and ended in September with her entry into the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for overhaul. The period in the ‚Äòyard occupied Badger for the remainder of 1981 and the first quarter of 1982. She did not put to sea again until late May when she began refresher training, inspections, examinations, and certifications. From then on, the frigate busied herself with the never-ending cycle of readiness exercises and drills punctuated by the usual material inspections and proficiency examinations. She continued so engaged for the rest of 1982 and the first five weeks of 1983. On 8 February 1983, Badger embarked on a six- week cruise to the west coast in company with some other DesRon 25 units: , , and . After completing a COMPTUEX, a READIEX, and a naval gunfire support requalification, Badger returned to Hawaii on 21 March and began a month of preparations for overseas movement. The frigate stood out of Pearl Harbor with and on 24 April. The three warships then carried out several exercises near Kauai on the Pacific missile range before beginning their voyage to the Far East on the 26th. After a passage that included a variety of drills and exercises and a five-day layover at Guam for a short availability, Badger reached Manila on 16 May 1983. Underway again on short notice, leaving behind some 52 men who had been on leave and liberty at the time of her sailing, she carried out surprise ASW operations west of Subic Bay between the 18th and the 20th, retrieving four of her men via the aircraft carrier on the latter date, and then headed for a liberty call at Hong Kong, where the remainder of the men left behind at her hurried departure joined her via the command ship . Back at sea on 27 May, the warship conducted further ASW work in the South China Sea until the end of the month. Badger made a short stop at Subic Bay for fuel on 1 June and then set out for Japan. She took part in an amphibious exercise along the way near Okinawa before arriving in Yokosuka on 16 June. She spent eight days in repairs at Yokosuka and then set a course back to the South China Sea where she carried out surveillance missions until the latter part of July. Badger then returned to Subic Bay where she made voyage repairs and requalified in naval gunfire support on the nearby Tabones range. On 27 July, she headed back to Yokosuka where she underwent still more repairs during the first 10 days of August. Badger returned to sea on 11 August 1983, and took up surveillance duty again, this time in the Sea of Japan. She concluded that assignment on 2 September and shaped a course for Sasebo, but received orders the following day to proceed north in the wake of the tragic downing, by a Soviet fighter, of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 over Sakhalin Island on 1 September. Rear Admiral William A. Cockell, Commander, Task Force 71, and a skeleton staff, embarked in Badger on 9 September via LAMPS helo from Wakanai, Japan, for further transfer to the destroyer Elliot to assume duties as Officer in Tactical Command (OTC) of the Search and Rescue (SAR) effort. During the forenoon watch on 17 September, however, Badgers embarked SH-2F helicopter from HSL-37 (Detachment 2) went down at sea; ), however, promptly rescued the four-man crew from the water. Badger ended her part in the KAL 007 SAR effort on the 20th and reached Yokosuka on the 21st to prepare for the voyage back to Hawaii. That journey began on 23 October and included participation in Exercise Battle Week 84-1 followed by a visit to nearby Apra, Guam, before Badger finally managed to return home on Armistice Day 1983. Admiral William J. Crowe, Jr., Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command, visited the ship on 29 November and congratulated the ship's officers and men on their recent deployment, emphasizing their role during the KAL 007 SAR operation. Post-deployment leave and upkeep and holiday standdown, broken only by a brief period underway on 20 and 21 December to escort as she operated locally, kept Badger in port at Pearl for the rest of 1983.  1984‚Äì85  Badger got underway for the first time in 1984 on 9 January when she put to sea for three days of tests and training with . Following an inspection and survey to gauge her fitness for further service, she began a two-month restricted availability. On 21 March, she finished the repair work and launched into a succession of post-availability trials, inspections, examinations, and certifications that continued through the middle of June. After that came refresher training in the local operating area until late July. On the 20th, Badger stood out of Pearl in company with and Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 5 for six weeks of drills and exercises in the waters along the west coast. She returned to Hawaii at the end of August and then, except for 17 days in drydock between 28 September and 15 October, spent September and October engaged in normal operations in Hawaiian waters. During the last week in October, Badger took part in the first phase of a major fleet exercise with a pair of carrier task groups built around and . After spending the period 2 to 6 November in port at Pearl Harbor, she returned to sea to conclude the exercise and then move on to the Far East for seven weeks of additional exercises. Travelling with the Carl Vinson task group, she participated in a series of training evolutions conducted in such diverse places as the Marianas, in the Philippine Sea, and in Japanese waters. Badger completed her part in the exercises early in December and, after a visit to Yokosuka, Japan, set out on the voyage back to Hawaii on the 13th in company with Joseph Strauss. The two warships reentered Pearl Harbor on 22 December, and Badger spent the rest of 1984 in port. Badger in heavy seas in 1985. Following an unusually brief standdown, Badger resumed operations very early in 1985. She put to sea on 10 January for a two-week cruise to conduct operations in an area in the eastern Pacific about two-thirds of the way from Oahu to the northern California coast. She returned to Hawaii from that mission on 24 January and settled into more than two months of local operations out of Pearl Harbor. Then, after a special assignment in the vicinity of Midway Island early in April, Badger completed a four-week restricted availability at Pearl Harbor. On 11 May, the frigate headed for the eastern Pacific once more. This time, however, she made it all the way to the west coast and took part in several exercises conducted in the southern California operating area. Concluding a four-week absence, Badger returned to Oahu on 14 June and began preparations to deploy overseas. After six weeks of getting ready, Badger stood out of Pearl Harbor on 2 August and joined the Orient-bound task group built around ) the next evening. The exercise-filled, 17-day passage to the Philippines ended on the 19th at Subic Bay where Badger began five days of repairs and meetings before heading to duty in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea on 24 August. Along the way, she and parted company with the task group to transit the Malacca Strait and conduct Exercise MERLION 85 with units of the Singapore Navy on 29 and 30 August. The two warships rejoined the task group in the Bay of Bengal on 1 September and, after recovering debris from a helicopter crash, resumed the voyage to the Arabian Sea. Badger reached the patrol area in the northern Arabian Sea on 10 September and began four weeks of duty on that station. Early in October, she made a five-day port visit at Mombasa and then sailed back to the Arabian Sea, where she completed a tender availability alongside at Al Masirah Island. Early in November, she called at Karachi, Pakistan, for a goodwill visit and carried out an ASW exercise with units of the Pakistani Navy. On 17 November, she rejoined the Kitty Hawk task group again south of Sri Lanka on its way back to Subic Bay. The task group remained at Subic for six days before setting out on the voyage back to Hawaii on 1 December.  1986‚Äì89  Badger on a midshipmen's summer training cruise in 1986. Reaching Pearl Harbor on 12 December 1985, Badger spent the rest of that year and the first weeks of 1986 in port engaged, at first, in post-deployment and holiday standdown and, later, carrying out a six-week availability. She put to sea for the first time after her return on 1 February to participate in readiness exercises near Kauai. Similar training activities in the local operating area kept her busy until the second week in April. At that time, Badger stood out of Pearl Harbor for a six-week goodwill cruise to the South Pacific. During the voyage, she called at Pago Pago and Apia in the Samoan Islands, Nukualofa and Vavau in the Tonga Islands, and Funafuti in the Tuvalu Islands before returning to Hawaii by way of Apia. The warship arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 12 May and began a four-week period of relative inactivity in port. Early in June, she put to sea to participate in a phase of the multinational exercise RIMPAC 86 and then returned to Oahu on the 14th to prepare for an extended training cruise to the west coast. On 23 June, Badger embarked on the seven-week round of exercises punctuated with visits to west coast ports that constituted EASTPAC 86. During that space of time, she visited Vancouver in British Columbia and the California ports of San Francisco and San Diego before returning to Hawaii on 9 August. Badger launching a SH-2 Seasprite helicopter during anti-submarine warfare exercises in 1986. For the remainder of 1986, the warship went to sea only rarely. She carried out some ASW exercises late in August and then spent five weeks in a maintenance availability. She returned to sea in mid-October for engineering drills and again early in November for more of the same and to complete a propulsion plant certification examination. When she reentered Pearl Harbor on 14 November, Badger started preparing for a three-month drydocking that began on 8 December. Although refloated on 2 March 1987, she did not resume active service for almost two more months. The repair work continued through March and during the first two weeks of April; and, although she returned to sea on two occasions during the second part of April, it was only for brief sea trials. Badger finally took up a more active schedule late in May with helicopter landing qualifications on the 20th and 21st and evolutions at sea during the last days of the month in connection with her material readiness inspection. In June, the frigate resumed a normal schedule of local training operations and continued so engaged for the rest of 1987. Badger continued to carry out training missions in the Hawaiian operating area well into 1988. Late in March, she embarked on a series of battle readiness exercises that carried out during a four-week cruise to the west coast. The warship returned to Pearl Harbor from that assignment at the end of April and then spent the following five weeks in port. She resumed local training missions on 9 June, but those lasted less than a fortnight. On 22 June, Badger stood out of Pearl Harbor on her way to the Far East as part of a task group built around Carl Vinson. Though she made most of the crossing with the task group, Badger did not remain a part of it throughout the deployment. She parted company with the unit on 4 July and headed for Japan, arriving in Yokosuka on the 16th. After five days of repairs and upkeep, the frigate set sail for the Philippines on 22 July. She reached Subic Bay on the 27th but remained only three days, putting to sea again on the 30th bound for Singapore. Her visit to Singapore, however, proved a brief one, shortened by orders on 6 August to rescue Vietnamese refugees in the vicinity of the Spratly Islands. On the 9th, Badger took on board 57 survivors of a group that had originally numbered 104 and sailed for the Philippines. The warship disembarked the refugees at Subic Bay on the 10th and, after several days of upkeep, set out for Japan again. During the remainder of August and the first part of September, Badger called at a succession of Japanese ports. On 12 September, she put to sea from Yokosuka for two weeks of operations in the East China Sea with a task group formed around Midway. She then visited Pusan, South Korea, on 28 and 29 September, before returning to sea for two weeks of surveillance operations in the Sea of Japan. In mid-October, the frigate visited Chinhae, Korea, for five days and then carried out four days of training with units of the South Korean Navy. Next came a call each at Pusan in late October and at Hong Kong early in November. Badger returned to Subic Bay on 11 November and made preparations for the voyage back to Hawaii. The last 7th Fleet assignment of her Navy career came to an end on 22 November when she embarked on that final western Pacific passage. The warship returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1988 and her post-deployment standdown lasted until 17 January 1989. She then resumed local operations in the Hawaiian Islands on a schedule that kept her moderately busy through the end of May. On 30 May, the frigate began an availability with a civilian contractor that lasted nearly four months. Badger completed the repairs on 24 September, carried out the usual trials and examinations in October, and resumed normal training missions out of Pearl Harbor early in November. She remained so occupied for the rest of 1989 and well into 1990. = 1990s = Late in March 1990, however, Badger undertook a new mission when she embarked a Coast Guard law enforcement detachment to carry out drug traffic interdiction operations. Her first taste of law enforcement duty lasted from 28 March to 12 April and then she resumed more familiar duty until mid-June. On 18 June, she embarked another Coast Guard detachment and set sail for the west coast to conduct another series of drug traffic interdiction missions in the eastern Pacific out of San Diego. That deployment lasted until the beginning of September when she transferred her helicopter detachment (HSL-37 Detachment 10) to and disembarked the Coast Guardsmen at San Francisco. Badger arrived back at Oahu on 11 September and began a restricted availability on the 20th that immobilized her for most of the months remaining in 1990. Badger took up active training again early in December 1990; but that lasted only about two weeks. The relative inactivity of holiday leave and upkeep commenced in mid- December and continued for about a month. In mid-January 1991, the warship resumed local training operations and pursued them until early June. During June and early July, Badger voyaged to the west coast one last time before being deactivated. She visited San Diego, California, Portland, Oregon, and Homer, Alaska before returning to Oahu on 16 July. Once back in Pearl, the frigate did not get underway again except to shift berths. Badger was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 20 December 1991, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1995. The former warship performed her last service for the Navy on 22 July 1998 at which time she was sunk as a target during the United States Third Fleet exercise RIMPAC 98 at . Badger earned one battle star during the Vietnam War.

During the Jacobite Uprising, he had raised and commanded troops in support of the king. He later served as a Member of Parliament from Bedfordshire (1747‚Äì1753). In 1750 he traveled to Nova Scotia and was part of the colonial administration. He had a history of melancholia, as it was then called, and committed suicide in New York shortly after taking office.  Early life  Osborn was born on 17 November 1715, at Chicksands village (Shefford, Bedfordshire, England), which was the seat of the Osborn family. His father was John Osborn, eldest son of Sir John Osborn, 2nd Baronet (see Osborn baronets). Of the previous four generations of paternal relatives, two grandmothers (Lady Doroty Danvers and Lady Eleanor Danvers) had belonged to the Danvers lineage. Osborn's mother was Sarah Byng. Her father was George Byng, the 1st Viscount Torrington, whereas her brother was the Admiral John Byng. Both Byng relatives were prominent figures against the Jacobite rising of 1689. In 1720 he succeeded his grandfather in the baronetcy. Osborn was married to Lady Mary Montagu, on 25 September 1740. She was of the 8th generation of Henry VIII's lineage. Her father was George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, whereas her brother George Montagu-Dunk became the 2nd Earl. Osborn begot two children, of whom one was named George. However, in 1743, Lady Montagu died after delivering the second child. Osborn was quite affected by grief for her for the rest of his life. During the subsequent years, Osborn was a frequent guest at the Montagu-Dunk's manor of Horton (Northamptonshire).  Political career  When Charles Edward Stuart rebelled in 1745 (Jacobite rising of 1745) in behalf of the House of Stuart, Osborn raised troops to support the King George II, commanding such forces into battle, within Colonel Bedford's regiment, under the Duke of Cumberland. Subsequently, Osborn represented Bedfordshire as a Member of Parliament (1747‚Äì1753). In 1750, following the 2nd Earl of Halifax, who was presiding the Board of Trade and founding the city of Halifax in Nova Scotia, Danvers Osborn travelled to Nova Scotia for six weeks, integrating into the Nova Scotia Council (August). Therein, many issues were attended by Osborn, such as the supplies of the new settlers, the remuneration of the construction workers of the royal projects, and the regulation of the local trade, which was functioning then on Sundays despite the biblical precepts. Attending to so many local matters brought Osborn esteem from the settlers. Back in England, in December, he discussed the issues of Halifax with the official functionaries of trade and plantation. In May 1753, the Board of Trade recommended that Danvers Osborn should be the next Royal Governor of the Province of New York. In July, his appointment was approved. After his arrival on 6 October, Osborn was welcomed officially by the mayor and the assemblymen of New York, and formally assumed his office on 10 October. His personal secretary was the Englishman Thomas Pownall.  Death  On 12 October 1753, Osborn's dead body was found in the garden of the house in which he was lodged, which belonged to a local councilman. The body presented evidences of strangulation. James De Lancey, the lieutenant governor who took over as acting governor on Osborn's death, reported to the Board of Trade that Osborn had had a melancholic demeanor, which evidenced a great psychological disorder. Historically, such depression to provoke Osborn's suicide, is attributed to grief over his lost wife. The New York Post reported his death and gave details of the last week of his life before his suicide. Initially, Osborn was buried at the Trinity Church of New York. In 1754, his remains were transported to Osborn's native parish of England (Chicksands), where he was reinterred.

Early life and education  De Lancey was born in New York City on November 27, 1703, the first son of √âtienne de Lancy and Anne, a daughter of Stephanus Van Cortlandt. His brother, Oliver De Lancey, became a senior Loyalist officer in the American War of Independence, joining General Howe on Staten Island in 1776, and raising and equipping De Lancey's Brigade, three battalions of 1,500 Loyalist volunteers from New York State. His sister Susannah Delancey became the wife of Admiral Sir Peter Warren, and another sister, Anne DeLancey, became the wife of John Watts, member of the New York General Assembly. James went to England for his schooling, and to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was tutored by future Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Herring, before studying law at the Inner Temple, London. Having been admitted to the bar in 1725, he returned to New York to practice law and enter politics.  Career  Also in 1729, De Lancey was made a member of the New York Assembly, and in 1731 was appointed as second justice of the Supreme Court of New York. In 1730, De Lancey was chosen to lead a commission to frame a new charter for the City of New York. Passed into law in 1732 by the New York Assembly, \\"the Montgomerie Charter,\\" was principally the work of James De Lancey, who, for his services, was presented with the Freedom of the City Medal. In 1733, on the removal of chief justice Lewis Morris, De Lancey was appointed in his stead, and served as chief justice of New York for the remainder of his life. He presided over the 1735 trial of journalist John Peter Zenger on charges of sedition and libel against Governor William Cosby. Zenger won his case, and the Zenger trial is recognized as a landmark case in establishing freedom of the press in America. In 1744, one year into George Clinton's position as Governor of New York, De Lancey was granted a commission as New York's chief justice where he became a dominant political force with many relying on his support for their continued time in office and salary. In the same year, he was elected a member of The American Philosophical Society.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1997, 1:120‚Äì124. In 1746 a dispute arose between Governor George Clinton and the New York Assembly regarding the governor's salary. Chief Justice De Lancey supported the legislature's position in the controversy, thus incurring the enmity of Governor Clinton, who subsequently refused to acknowledge a commission from King George II (dated October 27, 1747), appointing De Lancey as Lieutenant Governor of New York. Governor Clinton withheld De Lancey's commission as lieutenant governor until October 1753. With the advent of the French and Indian War, Lt. Gov. De Lancey convened and presided over a congress of colonial delegates held in Albany, New York in June 1754 (Albany Congress), for the purpose of establishing an alliance with the Indians for the common defense against the French. In October 1754, Lt. Gov. De Lancey granted a charter for the creation of King's College (now Columbia University). In July 1755, Lt. Gov. De Lancey attended a council of governors of the colonies, held at Alexandria, Virginia, to coordinate defense matters with General Braddock against the French. In September 1755, Sir Charles Hardy arrived from London and assumed the functions of Governor of New York, thus returning Lt. Gov. De Lancey to his role as Chief Justice. Hardy's tenure as governor came to an end in July 1757, when Sir Charles took command of a military expedition to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, once again leaving De Lancey the de facto ruler of the province, which he remained till his death.

The airport is one of two bases for the Missouri Air National Guard and also serves general aviation. While the airport is in Missouri, there are no access roads or bridges over the Missouri River to the airport. The only access point is over a bridge in Elwood, Kansas. History C-130H Hercules of the 139th Airlift Wing overhead Rosecrans Memorial Airport The site of Rosecrans Memorial Airport was once called the French Bottoms. It was surrounded by four towns, three of which existed as late as 1979. The northern part of the French Bottoms was settled first, in the 1830s-50's, and has since washed away. The settlers were French-born and/or descendants of earlier French settlers. In 1877 most of the land that now comprises the airport was on a river bank on what was called \\"made land.\\" This land had been formed by river deposits. By this year the French Bottoms had sixty houses, one church, and two schools. The rich river bottom land, totaling about five thousand acres (20 km¬≤), was traditionally used for farming. Some of the descendants of the early French settlers still lived in the bottoms in 1939, when the area was razed to make way for the airport. The airport was named in honor of Sgt. Guy Wallace Rosecrans \\"and comrades\\" of the 153rd Aero Squadron, U.S. Army Air Service, 1917-18. Rosecrans was the only St. Joseph airman killed in World War I. The new 1939 flying field was the third airport in St. Joseph to bear the name Rosecrans. In 1922 the first Rosecrans Field was opened at Lake Contrary. The second was Rosecrans Municipal Airport on the waterworks road, abandoned because of its small size and its dangerous proximity to the Missouri River bluffs to its east. The 1939 airport was developed by the city as a municipal airport. In 1939 two three-thousand-foot (910 m) runways were built, and a hangar east of the runway intersection. During World War II the federal government established an Army Air Forces base at Rosecrans with numerous improvements being made in 1942 and 1943. The diagonal runways were doubled in length and a north-south runway was built, along with an aircraft parking apron and many temporary buildings, including Hangar T-1020. In 1948 much of the airfield's facilities were conveyed to the city, except for set aside for use by the Air National Guard. Airport construction during this period consisted of pump house buildings and T-hangars (1949‚Äì50) and a terminal and administration building (1951‚Äì52). The Great Flood of 1951 damaged many of the temporary World War II airport buildings beyond economical repair. The Missouri River changed course in the flood, cutting off the airport from its land connection to St. Joseph. Today, visitors from Missouri go through Kansas via the Pony Express Bridge and Elwood, Kansas to reach the airport. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers formalized the course change by dredging cut-off channel for the river between the airport and downtown St. Joseph. An oxbow lake (Browning Lake) was formed in the old Bellemont Bend and Elwood Bend portions of the river channel. The cut-off channel modified portions of Bon Ton Bend and St. Joseph Bend, and separated the city from the airport. A bridge and highway were later constructed to connect the two. Construction during the next twenty years included a main hangar building (1954), a flight office building (1960), an emergency generator building (1963), a center taxiway (1973), and a runway (1974‚Äì75). The Great Flood of 1993 destroyed the City Administration Building and the Cockpit Cafe. Both were rebuilt. The oldest, center hangar had to be demolished. In 1994, the diagonal runway, Runway 13-31, was rebuilt into a new assault landing strip for the Air National Guard and as an additional VFR runway for general aviation aircraft. A new fixed-base operator building and a hangar were also constructed. Airline flights began by 1939, on Mid-Continent. Successor Braniff pulled out in 1959, replaced by Frontier Airlines and Ozark Air Lines; Ozark left in 1960 and Frontier left in 1969, three years before Kansas City International Airport opened south of St Joseph. Since then the airport has been used for crop spraying, charter passenger and cargo services, pilot training, nightly mail delivery, and until its acquisition by American Airlines, pilot training by Trans World Airlines (TWA). Its main use now is as a base for the Missouri Air National Guard. Rosecrans Air National Guard Base With the end of World War II, much of the former U.S. Army Air Forces installation was transferred to the city with the exception of for the National Guard. With the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, the military facilities became part of the newly established Air National Guard. This facility became the foundation for the current Rosecrans Air National Guard Base. Rosecrans ANGB is currently home to the 139th Airlift Wing (139 AW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit of the Missouri Air National Guard, which functions as the host wing for the installation. The 139 AW flies the \\"H2\\" variant of the C-130H Hercules tactical airlift aircraft. An additional tenant command at Rosecrans ANGB is the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center (AATTC), a combined activity of both the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The mission of the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center (AATTC) is to increase the warfighting effectiveness and survivability of all USAF air mobility forces. AATTC is made up of full- time Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel dedicated to increasing the warfighting effectiveness and survivability of air mobility forces, providing advanced tactics training to tactical airlift crews and support personnel from the Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, Air Mobility Command, Air Combat Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, the United States Marine Corps, and twelve Allied nations. The AATTC functions as a clearinghouse for gathering and disseminating airlift tactics information. Since 1983 the AATTC has hosted an annual Tactics Symposium at Rosecrans ANGB as a forum for providing crosstalk across the tactics community.http://www.mostjo.ang.af.mil/AATTC/ccmessage.htm Both the 139 AW and the AATTC are made up of a mix of approximately 400 full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, augmented by over 1000 traditional part-time Air National Guardsmen and Air Force Resevists.

Sonny Boy Williamson II recorded it in 1963, but the song was not released until 1966. Led Zeppelin adapted it in part as a homage to Williamson in 1969 and subsequently, the song has been recorded by several artists. Recording and release Sonny Boy Williamson recorded the song on January 11, 1963 in Chicago. He alternates his vocal sections with harmonica phrases, accompanied by Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy on guitar, Milton Rector on bass guitar, Al Duncan on drums, and either Lafayette Leake or Billy Emerson on organ. AllMusic reviewer Bill Janovitz describes Williamson's harp playing as \\"subdued\\" and his vocal delivery as \\"smooth\\": \\"The swinging music chugs like a train, a feeling it is supposed to evoke for the lyrics \\"Bring It On Home\\" was released three years later in early 1966, when it was included on the Chess Records Williamson compilation The Real Folk Blues. Chess subsidiary Checker Records also released it as a single, but it did not reach the record charts. Led Zeppelin version In 1969, English rock band Led Zeppelin recorded a version of the song for their album Led Zeppelin II. The intro and outro were deliberate homages to the Sonny Boy Williamson song, whereas the rest of the track was an original composition by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. Plant's harmonica part was recorded in Vancouver. The band went on tour with the master tapes for Led Zeppelin II and recorded parts in various studios. Led Zeppelin frequently performed this song live at Led Zeppelin concerts, first appearing as an encore on the band's 1970 UK tour. When played live, the song exhibited sharp interplay between Page's guitar, John Bonham's drums and John Paul Jones' bass. This can be seen on the Led Zeppelin DVD, which features a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970. A recording from a June 25, 1972, concert in Los Angeles is included on How the West Was Won. From 1973, the song was dropped from the band's live set list. However, the middle section riff was retained and served as the introduction to \\"Black Dog\\" on the band's 1973 tour of the United States, as documented in the concert film The Song Remains the Same. \\"Bring It On Home\\" was played at the reunion of surviving Led Zeppelin members staged at Jason Bonham's wedding reception in May 1990. =Copyright issue= Without songwriter Willie Dixon's knowledge, Arc Music, the music publishing arm of Chess Records, brought a claim against Led Zeppelin for using \\"Bring It On Home\\" without its permission. The group maintained that they copied parts of the song as an intentional tribute to Williamson, but resolved the matter with an undisclosed cash settlement.

SPring-8 (an acronym of Super Photon Ring ‚Äì 8 GeV) is a synchrotron radiation facility located in Sayo Town, Sayo District, Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan, which was developed jointly by RIKEN and the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. It is owned and managed by RIKEN, and run under commission by the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute. The machine consists of a storage ring containing an 8 GeV electron beam. On its path around the storage ring, the beam passes through insertion devices to produce synchrotron radiation with energies ranging from soft X-rays (300 eV) up to hard X-rays (300 keV). The synchrotron radiation produced at SPring-8 is used for materials analysis and biochemical protein characterization by many Japanese manufacturers and universities. Together with the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory and the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source at Cornell University in the United States, the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France and PETRA at DESY in Hamburg, Germany, it is one of the five large (beam energy greater than 5 GeV) synchrotron radiation facilities in the world. Research The Laser Electron Photon Experiment at SPring-8 (LEPS) is an experiment producing high-energy (GeV) photon beams by the inverse Compton scattering of photons upon the 8 GeV electrons of the SPring-8 synchrotron. These are then used for various particle physics experiments on hadrons. The first beam was produced in 1999, and data-taking commenced in 2000. The collaboration is known for their reports of a resonance which they interpret as a pentaquark candidate made of two up quarks, two down quarks and a strange antiquark (uudd). The 2008 Review of Particle Physics of the Particle Data Group ruled out the existence of this resonance, but new reports from LEPS indicate that the resonance could be seen in the ‚Üí channel. Use by police The materials analysis at SPring-8 can be used as forensics to identify substances for police investigations by detecting the types and combinations of impurities. For example, in the 1998 Wakayama curry poisoning incident, the arsenic used as the poisoning agent in a communal pot of curry contained trace impurities of bismuth and antimony, which were also present in arsenic found in the perpetrator's home. In another case, evidence from SPring-8 led to the arrest of three former members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult suspected in the 1995 shooting of Takaji Kunimatsu, Japan's head of the National Police Agency at the time. Like the curry poisoning incident, impurities in the metal traces in the coat of a suspect were matched to impurities in the gun used in the shooting. In popular culture In the Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG anime series, SPring-8 is mentioned several times, and is the facility where the character Ishikawa takes a sample of weapons-grade Plutonium to be analyzed to verify its source. In Salvation of a Saint, a piece of evidence is sent to SPring-8 for analysis.

Pandion embassy The Pompeii Lakshmi ivory statuette, found in 1938 in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in 79 CE), is thought to have originated in Bhokardan, Satavahana Empire . It testifies to the intensity of Indo-Roman trade relations at the time.State Intervention and Popular Response: Western India in the Nineteenth Century, Mariam Dossal, Ruby Maloni, Popular Prakashan, 1999, p.46 Roman historical accounts describe an embassy sent by the \\"Indian king Porus (Pandion (?) Pandya (?) or Pandita (?) ) to Caesar Augustus sometime between 22 BC and 13 AD. The embassy was travelling with a diplomatic letter on a skin in Greek, and one of its members was a sramana who burned himself alive in Athens to demonstrate his faith. The event made a sensation and was described by Nicolaus of Damascus, who met the embassy at Antioch (near present day Antakya in Turkey) and related by Strabo (XV,1,73 ) and Dio Cassius (liv, 9). A tomb was made to the sramana, still visible in the time of Plutarch, which bore the mention: Strabo also states that Nicolaus of Damascus in giving the details of his tomb inscription specified his name was \\"Zarmanochegas\\" and he \\"immortalized himself according to the custom of his country.\\" Cassius Dio (Hist 54.9) and Plutarch cite the same storyElledge CD.

Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch vol 1. Curzon Press, Richmond 1990. p 431 fn 4. HL Jones' translation of the inscription as mentioned by Strabo reads it as \\"The Sramana master, an Indian, a native of Bargosa, having immortalized himself according to the custom of his country, lies here.\\"Elledge CD. Life After Death in Early Judaism. Mohr Siebeck Tilbringen 2006 p125 These accounts at least indicate that Indian religious men (Sramanas, to which the Buddhists belonged, as opposed to Hindu Brahmanas) were circulating in the Levant during the time of Jesus. Buddhist culture and pre-Christian Greece From the time of Jesus or soon after: a statue of Siddartha Gautama preaching, in the Greco- Buddhist style of Gandhara, present-day Pakistan By the time of Jesus, the teachings of the Buddha had already spread through much of India and penetrated into Sri Lanka, Central Asia and China. p. 274 They display certain similarities to Christian moral precepts of more than five centuries later; the sanctity of life, compassion for others, rejection of violence, confession and emphasis on charity and the practice of virtue. Will Durant, noting that the Emperor Ashoka sent missionaries, not only to elsewhere in India and to Sri Lanka, but to Syria, Egypt and Greece, speculated in the 1930s that they may have helped prepare the ground for Christian teaching.1. Will Durant, The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage, Part One (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1935), vol. 1, p. 449. Mauryan proselytizing Ashoka ascended the throne of India around 270 BC. After his conversion to Buddhism he dispatched missionaries to the four points of the compass. Archeological finds indicate these missions had been \\"favorably received\\" in lands to the West. Ptolemy II Philadelphus, one of the monarchs Ashoka mentions in his edicts, is recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra: \\"India has been treated of by several other Greek writers who resided at the courts of Indian kings, such, for instance, as Megasthenes, and by Dionysius, who was sent thither by Philadelphus, expressly for the purpose: all of whom have enlarged upon the power and vast resources of these nations.\\"Pliny the Elder, \\"The Natural History\\", Chap. 21 Records from Alexandria, long a crossroads of commerce and ideas, indicate that itinerant monks from the Indian subcontinent may have influenced philosophical currents of the time. Roman accounts centuries later speak of monks traveling to the Middle East, and there is mention of an embassy sent by the Indian king Pandion, or Porus (possibly Pandya), to Caesar Augustus around 13 AD (see Pandion Embassy section above). Expansion of Buddhist culture westward Meanwhile, the Buddha's teachings had spread north-west, into Parthian territory. Buddhist stupa remains have been identified as distant as the Silk Road city of Merv.\\"The Silk Road city of Marv (Grk. Margiana), situated in the eastern part of the Parthian Empire, became a major Buddhist center\\" Foltz, \\"Religions of the Silk Road\\", p47 Soviet archeological teams in Giaur Kala, near Merv, have uncovered a Buddhist monastery, complete with huge buddharupa. Parthian nobles such as An Shih Kao are known to have adopted Buddhism and were among those responsible for its further spread towards Han China. Western knowledge of Buddhism The birth of Siddhartha Gautama, Gandhara, 2nd‚Äì3rd century AD. Some knowledge of Buddhism existed quite early in the West. In the 2nd century AD Clement of Alexandria wrote about the Buddha: He also recognized Bactrian Buddhists (Sramanas) and Indian Gymnosophists for their influence on Greek thought: The story of the birth of the Buddha was also known: a fragment of Archelaos of Carrha (278 AD) mentions the Buddha's virgin-birth, and Saint Jerome (4th century) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says \\"was born from the side of a virgin\\". Queen Maya came to bear the Buddha after receiving a prophetic dream in which she foresaw the descent of the Bodhisattva (Buddha-to-be) from the Tu·π£ita heaven into her womb. This story has some parallels with the story of Jesus being conceived in connection with the visitation of the Holy Spirit to the Virgin Mary. The latest impact upon Christian and Greek literature is the Christianized version of the legend of the life of the Buddha found in the Buddhist texts of the 3rd century CE and the epic Barlaam and Josaphat. The latter is traditionally attributed to Saint John of Damascus (d.c.750 CE), but it seems that he took it from the Arabic Kitab Bilawhar wa Yudasaf, which in its turn had also been taken from India via the Manichaeans.*, p.116. Buddhism and Gnosticism Early 3rd century‚Äì4th century Christian writers such as Hippolytus and Epiphanius write about a Scythianus, who visited India around 50 AD from where he brought \\"the doctrine of the Two Principles\\". According to Cyril of Jerusalem, Scythianus' pupil Terebinthus presented himself as a \\"Buddha\\" (\\"He called himself Buddas\\" ). Terebinthus went to Palestine and Judaea (\\"becoming known and condemned\\"), and ultimately settled in Babylon, where he transmitted his teachings to Mani, thereby creating the foundation of Manichaeism: Buddhism and Pyrrhonism Because of the high degree of similarity between Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus,Adrian Kuzminski, Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism 2008 Thomas McEvilleyThomas McEvilley, The Shape of Ancient Thought 2002 pp499-505 and Matthew Nealehttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:347ed882-f7ac-4098-908f-5bb391462a6c/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe;_filename=THESIS01&type;_of_work=Thesishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMZwyPdY7eg&t;=52s suspect that NƒÅgƒÅrjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India during the era of Roman trade with India. According to legend, Nagarjuna said he was influenced by books inaccessible to other people. He was approached by NƒÅgas (semi-divine serpents) in human form. They invited him to their kingdom to see some texts they thought would be of great interest to him. Nagarjuna studied those texts and brought them back to India.Lex Hixon Mother of the Buddhas: Meditations on the Prajnaparamita Sutra 1993 p.xii According to Matthew Neale, \\"NƒÅgƒÅrjuna was a skillful diplomat concealing novel doctrines in acceptably Buddhist discourse... to conceal their doctrines‚Äô derivation from foreign wisdom traditions.\\"Matthew Neale Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonism 2014 p. vi See also * Index of Buddhism-related articles * Buddhism and Christianity * Greco-Buddhism * Roman trade with India * Secular Buddhism * Sino-Roman relations *Ancient Greece‚ÄìAncient India relations Notes # Strabo on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens, Paragraph 73 #Clement of Alexandria \\"The Stromata, or Miscellanies\\" Book I, Chapter XV # Clement of Alexandria \\"The Stromata, or Miscellanies\\" Book I, Chapter XV # Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lecture 6 # Porphyry \\"On abstinence from animal food\\" Book IV, Paragraphs 17&18.

Formerly a part of Hispania Tarraconensis, Balearica gained its autonomy due to its geographic separation and economic independence from the mainland. The province included three major islands: Balearis Major (Majorca), Balearis Minor (Minorca), and Ebusus (Ibiza), and the small island of Colubraria or Ophiusa (Formentera). The islands were grouped as the Gymnesiae‚ÄîMajorca and Minorca, and the Pityusae‚ÄîIbiza and Formentara. right Conquest Ruins of the city of Pollentia on Majorca Prior to the Roman occupation, the island was settled by the native Iberians (Talaiotic culture) and then by Phoenicians. The chief city of Minorca, Mago (Mahon) was founded by the Carthaginians. The islands, because of there being two excellent harbors on the largest island, Majorca, were a base for pirates from Sardinia and southern Gaul.M. G. Morgan. ‚ÄòThe Roman conquest of the Balearic Isles‚Äô, California Studies in Classical Antiquity, vol. 2, 1969, pp. 217. In 123 BC, a consul for that year, Q. Caecilius Metellus conquered the islands, easily routing and subduing the population. While not being a great victory militarily, Metellus received a triumph (parade) in 121 BC, and the surname Balearicus for bringing the islands into the Roman fold. Metellus founded the colonies of Palma and Pollentia on Majorca. Pollentia became the capitol. The Roman historians Florus, Orosius and Strabo provide good accounts of Balearicus' activities in 123‚Äì122.Badian, E. Foreign Clientelea. Oxford University press, 1958, pp. 182. Most importantly, they describe why the islands were invaded and why it happened in 123 BC. The answer is that the islands were suddenly overrun by pirates escaping the Roman campaigns in Transalpine Gaul in 126 and Sardinia in 125 BC. The Baleares were the last place for them to hide in the western Mediterranean. Control of the islands facilitated supply and trade from Hispania to Italy and vice versa, and they were also very fertile. In addition, 123 BC was the year that Gaius Gracchus held the powerful position of tribune. His fortune lay in clients he had in Hispania and Asia, so he had immense interest in seeing the islands captured and pacified. Although other motives ‚Äì military, economic and political ‚Äì may have played a subsidiary part in the decision, the islands were annexed in 123 BC to complete the pacification of Transalpine Gaul and Sardinia, which were resisting due to pirate influences.Morgan. pp. 231. Economy The territory was extremely valuable economically, so much so that Balearicus settled 3,000 ‚ÄòRomans‚Äô on the islands in two settlements on Majorca, Palma, and Pollentia. The two settlements attest to the importance of the islands being firmly under Roman control. There is some debate as to where these settlers came from, as it is unlikely there were this many Roman civilians available and willing to colonize Majorca from the mainland at this date. The most likely explanation is that they were veterans from the wars in Hispania and Roman-Spanish hybridae.J.S. Richardson. Hispaniae: Spain and the development of Roman Imperialism. Cambridge University Press, 1986, pp. 163. Pollentia was located on the northern side and served as a port for vessels sailing to or from Gaul and Hispania Tarraconensis. The larger settlement, Palma, had a large and sheltered harbor perfectly situated for ships riding the trade winds from Baetica and Mauretania Caesariensis. The Balearicas had much to trade. Pliny the Elder made a journey to the islands and described many features of their economy. They produced superior wheat compared to the rest of Spain (with Balearic wheat, one modius of grain yielded 35 pounds of bread; Baetic wheat, 22 pounds).J.J. Van Nostrand. ‚ÄòRoman Spain‚Äô, Economic Survey of Ancient Rome, vol. 3, 1937, pp. 176. Also described was a trade in snails and fine wine that was well received by Romans, with Balearica soon becoming a center of wine production.Cambridge Ancient Histories. vol. X, pp. 408. The sea was rich with oysters, tunny fish and mackerel. The bafii (dye-works) in the Baleares served the wool manufacturers of Baetica en route to markets in Italy and the east.J.J. Van Nostrand. pp. 218. Stemming from this, the islands were rich in red ochre (earth colored with iron oxide), used to make red pigment for frescos.I.L.S., pp. 1875. Slingers Balearica was also known for its fighting slingers who were heavily recruited as mercenaries by the Romans. Their expertise as slingers is said by historians such as Posidorius, Diodoros and Strabo to be the result of their being made, while children, to earn their daily bread by slinging it off a post from many paces away depending on age.Morgan. pp. 219. Some slingers fought for Caesar in the Gallic War, and against him at Massalia.Curchin, Leonard. Roman Spain: Conquest and Assimilation. Routledge Inc., 1991, pp. 101. The islands are named for their famed fighters - balearica, meaning \\"land of the slinger\\" (ballo) in Greek. Government Before being separated, Hispania Balearica was the fourth district of the Tarraconensis with a native local government headed by a council. It served to provide for local needs and as a link directly to Rome. During the reign of Augustus the Balearicans requested help in stopping a plague of rabbits for which the Emperor dispatched troops.Curchin, Leonard. Pp. 64. Hispania Balearica became an independent province during the reign of Emperor Diocletian sometime after 284 AD. Under Diocletian, sweeping reforms of the provincial administration were enacted, designed to separate military and civic authority. Also, to reduce the power of other officials, the provinces were systematically reduced in size. All provinces were now under the direct control of the Emperor. All officials were chosen by him, including the legati pro praetore, men of praetorian rank who ran civic affairs in the province, and curators who ran the municipalities within provinces.C.A.H., vol. IX, pp.347-48. Balearica was separated because it was not reliant on the mainland for any staples and had special needs as a trading center that were more difficult to fulfil as a municipality than as a province. By the time of Diocletian, the islands' population was over 30,000, and they were granted their own Roman bishop in 418 AD.Bouchier, E.S. Spain Under the Roman Empire. Oxford University Press, 1914, pp. 179. Decline and fall In 426 the Vandals under King Gunderic captured Carthago Nova, the base of the \\"main naval force in the Western Mediterranean.\\" That year or the next the king led a raid on Balearica. In 455, following the death of Valentinian III, Gunderic's successor Gaiseric, now established in North Africa, annexed Balearica along with Corsica and Sardinia, presumably to gain a naval base to attack Roman naval forces. Around 553 forces of the Byzantine general Belisarius recaptured the islands for the Empire, where they remained until likely the tenth century when they were occupied by the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba.

The region lies in what is now southeastern Turkey.The History of Rome By Theodor Mommsen, William Purdie Dickson. The region that was to become Sophene was part of the kingdom of Ararat (Urartu) in the 8th-7th centuries BC. After unifying the region with his kingdom in the early 8th century BC, king Argishtis I of Urartu resettled many of its inhabitants in his newly built city of Erebuni (modern day Armenian capital Yerevan). Around 600 BC, Sophene became part of the newly emerged ancient Armenian Kingdom of the Orontids. This dynasty acted as satraps of Armenia firstly under Median Empire, later under Persian Empire. According to Anania Shirakatsi's Ashkharatsuyts (\\"World Atlas,\\" 7th century), Tsopk (Sophene) was the 2nd among the 15 provinces of Greater Armenia. It consisted of 8 cantons (gavar):Anania Shirakatsi, Geography. *Khordzyan *Hashtyank *Paghnatun *Balahovit *Tsopk Shahunyats *Andzit *Degik *Gavrek 250px After Alexander the Great's campaigns in 330s BC and the subsequent collapse of the Achaemenid Empire, Sophene remained part of the newly independent kingdom of Greater Armenia. In the early 3rd century BC, at the instigation of the Seleucid Empire, which was trying to weaken the Armenian kingdom, Sophene, split from Greater Armenia, forming the Kingdom of Sophene. The kingdom was ruled by a branch of the Armenian royal dynasty of Orontids. Sophene later split from the Sophene-Commagene kingdom as well, forming an independent kingdom. Commagene was part of Sophene at this time. Around 200 BC, in his attempt to finally subjugate Armenia, Seleucid king Antiochus III conquered both Greater Armenia and Sophene, installing Armenian generals Artaxias I and Zariadres as governors-strategoi in the respective kingdoms. Following Antiochus' defeat by the Romans at the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, both Zareh and Artashes declared themselves independent kings. Zareh and his descendants ruled the kingdom of Sophene until it was reunified with Greater Armenia by Tigranes the Great in the 80s BC.

Originally a firm royalist, after 1922 he shifted towards the republican Venizelists, and was executed in 1935 for supporting a failed republican coup.  Life  Born in Missolonghi on 1 January 1857, Anastasios Papoulas enlisted in the Greek Army in 1878. He fought in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, and later served as head of police of Athens. During the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13 he commanded the 10th Infantry Regiment. After the end of the wars he was assigned to divisional and corps commands, but in 1917 he was dismissed from the Army due to his royalist sympathies during the National Schism. With the electoral victory of the pro-royalist United Opposition in November 1920, he was recalled to active service and appointed commander-in- chief of the Greek forces (the Army of Asia Minor) in Anatolia, replacing Lt. General Leonidas Paraskevopoulos. He commanded the Army of Asia Minor against the Turkish nationalists in the failed Greek offensives of spring 1921 (First Battle of ƒ∞n√∂n√º, Second Battle of ƒ∞n√∂n√º), the Greek summer offensive of 1921 (Battle of K√ºtahya‚ÄìEski≈üehir and Battle of Sakarya) and the subsequent retreat to the lines captured in the K√ºtahya‚ÄìEski≈üehir battle. On 19 May 1922, due to his disagreement with the government on the further prosecution of the war, he was dismissed and retired from active service. Following the end of the war in 1922, Papoulas became a strong opponent of the monarchy after the establishment of the Second Hellenic Republic as a supporter of the Venizelos government during the late 1920s and the early 1930s. As one of the leaders of a pro-Venizelos coup attempt in March 1935, his failure resulted in his capture and eventual execution for treason on 24 April 1935 in Athens.

The Palestinian Arab Workers' Society was inactivity until January 1930, when it organised in Haifa the first countrywide congress of Arab workers. Sixty-one delegates claiming to represent some 3,000 workers attended. Almost half the delegates came from Haifa itself, and nearly half of those represented the railway workers there who constituted the PAWS' main support base. Smaller contingents from Jerusalem, Jaffa, and other towns represented workers in a variety of trades. Though a number of Arab unionists who belonged to or sympathized with the Palestine Communist Party helped organise the congress, it was largely under the control of the more conservative and noncommunist unionists who had originally founded the PAWS in 1925. The congress resolved to set up a nationwide labor movement which would lead the struggle to improve the wages and working conditions of Arab workers and secure their rights. It also declared its opposition to Jewish immigration and Zionism and its support for Palestine's independence as an Arab state. In response to Zionist efforts to secure a large percentage of government jobs for Jews, on the grounds that Jews paid a disproportionately large share of taxes, the congress called on the government of Palestine to reserve for Arab workers a share of jobs equal to the proportion of Arabs in the general population.Lockman, Zachary. (1996). Comrades and Enemies: Arab and Jewish Workers in Palestine, 1906-1948. University of California Press. This first Arab workers' congress proved not a new beginning for the Arab labor movement in Palestine but an isolated incident. The PAWS was unable to follow up and lay the basis for an effective countrywide organization, and for the next few years it remained an organization whose base was largely restricted to Haifa and to railway workers. Nonetheless, the congress made at least some Histadrut leaders feel that a coherent program of activity among Arab workers was now an urgent necessity. From 1937 onwards, its general secretary was Sami Taha. Branches formed in Jaffa, Nazareth and al-Majdal. After Taha repeatedly refused to obey demands of the Arab Higher Committee (AHC), dominated by the al-Husayni members and loyalists, Taha was assassinated in September 1947, on the orders of Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and leader of the Palestinian Arabs.Palestine Betrayed by Efraim Karsh, 2010, Yale University Press See also *Federation of Arab Trade Unions and Labor Societies *Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions References Other sources *Beinin, Joel (2001).

This was the first battle for the Army of the Grand National Assembly that was newly built standing army (D√ºzenli ordu) in place of irregular troops.  Battle  A Greek reconnaissance force under General Anastasios Papoulas began to move from their base in Bursa in the direction of Eski≈üehir in early January 1921. The battle began with a Greek assault on the positions of Miralay (Colonel) ƒ∞smet Pasha's troops near the railway station of ƒ∞n√∂n√º on January 9, 1921 and the fighting continued until dark. On January 10, the Greek Islands division began moving along the Kovalca-Akpƒ±nar line, and the ƒ∞zmir division was moving on Yenik√∂y-Teke- Hayriye direction and additional forces were moving on S√∂ƒü√ºt-G√ºnd√ºzbey line. Additionally √áerkes Ethem turned against the new central government in Ankara, refusing to join his forces with the regular army established under the command of ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º. The newly reconstituted Turkish army had to put down his rebellion while also fighting the Greeks.History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Stanford J. Shaw & Ezel Kural Shaw, Cambridge University Press, 1977, Volume II, , page 358 The better-equipped Greeks taking advantage of the fog pushed back the Turks around the railroad protected by the 11. division and took the dominant hill called Metristepe where fighting continued till 2pm. Ferik Fevzi √áakmak, following the recommendation of the commander of the Western Front Miralay ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, gave the order to pull back to Be≈ükarde≈üdaƒüƒ±-Zemzemiye-Oklubalƒ± line and moved the headquarters to √áukurhisar. After capturing the Akpƒ±nar-Kovalca line, Greeks stopped the attack and dug in. Upon observing the Turkish positions being reinforced with the 61. division, they realized that the Turks were determined to hold there and not fall back any further. Not feeling quite ready to withstand on the battlefield, the Greeks vacated the ƒ∞n√∂n√º vicinity and pulled back on January 11. The Turks were unable to pursue the Greeks not only because of exhaustion and lack of supplies but also because of the need to suppress √áerkes Ethem as well as the Green Army.  Results  Politically, the battle was significant as the arguments within the Turkish National Movement were concluded in the favor of the institution of a centralized control of the Army of the Grand National Assembly. As a result of his performance at ƒ∞n√∂n√º, Colonel ƒ∞smet was made a general. Also, the prestige gained in the aftermath of the battle helped the revolutionaries to announce the Turkish Constitution of 1921 on January 20, 1921. Internationally, the Turkish revolutionaries proved themselves as a military force. The prestige gained in the aftermath of the battle helped revolutionaries to initiate a new round of negotiations with Soviet Russia which ended with the Treaty of Moscow on March 16, 1921. The second round of this small scale encounter, the Second Battle of ƒ∞n√∂n√º was to be replayed within a month in the same area, after the London Conference failed to reconcile the differences between the two sides.

It marked a turning point in the Greco-Turkish War and the Turkish War of Independence of which it was a part, as Greek forces had previously been victorious over mostly irregular Turkish forces and suffered their first major defeat in Asia minor.  Background  Sarigiannis (2nd from left) with PM Kalogeropoulos (seated) and other members of the Greek delegation in London, February 1921 After the First Battle of ƒ∞n√∂n√º, where Miralay (Colonel) ƒ∞smet Bey fought against a Greek detachment out of occupied Bursa, the Greeks prepared for another attack aiming the towns of Eskisehir and Afyonkarahisar with their inter-connecting rail-lines. Ptolemaios Sarigiannis, staff officer in the Army of Asia Minor, made the offensive plan. Meanwhile, the London Conference was held between February 21 and March 11, 1921. The Turkish side was not able to extract the concessions it demanded and thus the hostilities resumed again in March.  Battle  The Greeks were determined to make up for the setback they suffered in January and prepared a much larger force, outnumbering Mirliva ƒ∞smet's (a Pasha now) troops. The Greeks had grouped their forces in Bursa, U≈üak, ƒ∞zmit and Gebze. Against them, the Turks had grouped their forces at northwest of Eski≈üehir, east of Dumlupƒ±nar and Kocaeli. Participating in this battle were Turkish Western and Southern Fronts, Kocaeli Group and Kastamonu Command. Greek forces were from their Army of Asia Minor, I and III Army Corps. Sarigiannis was in the Conference of London when the Greek attack began, with General Konstantinos Pallis, Chief of Staff of the Army of Asia Minor, to have made some changes in the initial offensive plan. The battle began with a Greek assault on the positions of ƒ∞smet's troops on March 23, 1921. It took them four days to reach ƒ∞n√∂n√º due to delaying action of the Turkish front. The better-equipped Greeks pushed back the Turks and took the dominant hill called Metristepe on the 27th. A night counter-attack by the Turks failed to recapture it. Meanwhile, on March 24, Greek I Army Corps took Kara His√¢r-ƒ± S√¢hib (present-day Afyonkarahisar) after running over Dumlupƒ±nar positions. On 31 March ƒ∞smet attacked again after receiving reinforcements, and recaptured Metristepe. In a continuation battle in April, Refet Pasha retook the town of Kara His√¢r. The Greek III Army Corps retreated.  Aftermath  While the battle marked a turning point in the war, following the battles of ƒ∞n√∂n√º there was a stalemate, as the Turks had missed their chance to encircle and destroy the Greek army, which retreated in good order. There were casualties on both sides, and neither side was in a position or state of mind to make more advances. Most significantly, this was the first time the newly formed Turkish standing army faced their enemy and proved themselves to be a serious and well led force, not just a collection of rebels. This was a very much needed victory for Mustafa Kemal Pasha, as his opponents in Ankara were questioning his delay and failure in countering the rapid Greek advances in Anatolia. This battle forced the Allied capitals to take note of the Ankara Government and eventually within the same month they ended up sending their representatives there for talks. France and Italy changed their positions and became supportive of Ankara government in short order. The Greeks were determined to defeat the Turkish nationalists and end their resistance though and prepared for even a bigger showdown at the battles of K√ºtahya‚ÄìEski≈üehir and Sakarya.

It was used in various Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac models from 1964-1969. It was the same transmission marketed under different brand names by each division including ST-300 by Buick, Jetaway by Olds and simply Automatic by Pontiac.  Design  The ST300 had a three-element torque converter, a front and rear multiple-disc clutch pack, and a compound planetary gearset with a front band and a clutch pack for reverse and manual low gear. The unit was either air cooled or cooled with a small auxiliary oil cooler located beneath the engine radiator. It had a die cast aluminum case, and weighed . It was programmed to start in low gear, providing a gear ratio of 1.765:1 plus the additional low-speed multiplication of the torque converter. The shift pattern was Park-Reverse-Neutral-Drive-Low. In Drive at full throttle, it would upshift from low gear to high gear at . Under light throttle, depending on the final drive ratio, it might upshift at 10-15 mph. From 1964-1967, Buick and Oldsmobile versions of this transmission used a torque converter with a variable-pitch stator called Switch-Pitch by Buick and Variable Vane by Olds. The stator blades moved from high to low position by an electrical solenoid and a stator valve, controlled by a switch on the throttle linkage. At light to medium throttle, the stator blades were at 32¬∞, providing a torque multiplication of 1.8:1 and a converter stall speed of approximately 1800 rpm. At ‚Öî to full throttle, the blades switched to the 51¬∞ high position, giving torque multiplication of 2.45:1 and a stall speed of approximately 2300 rpm. The blades were also set to the high position at idle to limit creep when stopped in Drive. The variable-pitch stator was eliminated after 1967. This feature was not used on the Pontiac versions of this transmission.  History  The Super Turbine 300 (Jetaway) was introduced for the 1964 model year as a replacement for the earlier Buick Dynaflow and Oldsmobile/Pontiac Roto Hydramatic transmissions. It was offered on GM A platform cars Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Pontiac Tempest/Lemans/GTO through 1966, and was available on the full-sized Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 88Oldsmobile Jetstar 88/Delmont 88 as a less expensive alternative to the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic. If it was used with a V8 motor, the transmission had liquid lines which is cooled by the radiator whereas some of those coupled to V-6 or OHC inline six cylinder engines were air cooled or liquid cooled. This transmission was only produced with the \\"BOP\\" bell housing and was never used on any Chevrolet or Chevrolet based engines. From 1967-1969, the Super Turbine 300 was also available on the sporty Pontiac Firebird with the overhead cam inline six (230 and 250 cubic inches) or small V8 engines (326 and 350 cubic inches). Some of the rare later ST300's had a bell housing that was cast like a \\"multi-case\\", but was never drilled from the factory for the Chevrolet pattern in the United States other than the two lowest bolt holes that are shared, and never installed on any Chevy engine from the factory in the United States. It conceivably could have been drilled for the Chevrolet but there was never a reason to do that as the Powerglide was a strong transmission. The Super Turbine 300 was discontinued entirely after the 1969 model year in favor of the TH400 and lighter TH350 Turbo-Hydramatic, the latter using the Super Turbine 300's tailhousing. Due to its two-speed with torque converter design, the Super Turbine 300 is often confused with Chevrolet's Powerglide ‚Äî which was also a two-speed torque converter transmission, but the ST 300 was of a completely different design and shared almost no parts with the Chevy unit, which had been around since 1950. The low band was the same as the 1955 up PG along with the same style clutch plates. Correction, the internal operation of the ST300 automatic was similar to the 1962-1971 Powerglide and almost indistinguishable. Some parts were interchangeable. The ST300, used with V-8 engines had additional clutches in the clutch packs, so they could handle the extra power of the larger engines. One of the clutch drums and/or apply piston in the ST300 was often used to 'beef-up' a Powerglide for high performance/racing uses. Chevrolet 'beefed-up' the Powerglide by using a different planetary gear ratio.

He previously served in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He authored Bowuzhi, a compendium of stories about the supernatural. Background and service under Wei Zhang Hua's father, Zhang Ping (), was a commandery administrator in the Cao Wei state during the Three Kingdoms period. He died when Zhang Hua was still young. Zhang Hua's family became impoverished, and he was a shepherd when he was young. The official Liu Fang () was so impressed with Zhang Hua that he arranged for Zhang Hua to marry his daughter. Zhang Hua became known for his literary talent, and he wrote a collection of poems, ostensibly about birds ‚Äì but in fact about people's tendencies. His poems received great renown, and the commandery administrator recommended him to the regent, Sima Zhao. Sima Zhao made him one of his secretaries, and he distinguished himself in that role. However, as an Academician in the Ministry of Ceremonies (), he suffered disgrace when he was dismissed for negligence after one of the beams in the imperial ancestral temple broke. Service under the Jin dynasty In 265, after Sima Zhao's son, Sima Yan (Emperor Wu) usurped the throne from the last Cao Wei emperor Cao Huan and established the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420), he appointed Zhang Hua as a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate () and awarded him the title of a Secondary Marquis (). He was promoted to the position of a Master of Writing () later. Around 279 or 280, when the general Yang Hu encouraged Emperor Wu to conquer the Jin dynasty's rival state Eastern Wu, most officials strongly objected but Zhang Hua agreed with Yang Hu and became heavily involved in the strategies and logistic arrangements behind the campaign against Eastern Wu. After the Jin dynasty conquered Eastern Wu in 280, Emperor Wu enfeoffed Zhang Hua as the Marquis of Guangwu () to honour him for his contributions. Zhang Hua soon fell out of favour with Emperor Wu. When Emperor Wu once asked him who could be a regent for his son Sima Zhong (later Emperor Hui), Zhang Hua recommended Emperor Wu's brother, Sima You (the Prince of Qi). Although Sima You was clearly capable of fulfilling that role, Emperor Wu was angry with Zhang Hua because he feared that Sima You might usurp the throne from Sima Zhong in the future since he had much support from the masses. The officials who previously opposed the campaign against Eastern Wu seized this opportunity to speak ill of Zhang Hua in front of Emperor Wu and cause him to fall out of the emperor's favour. Emperor Wu then sent Zhang Hua away to the northern frontier in You Province to serve as Colonel Who Protects the Wuhuan () and General Who Stabilises the North (). Zhang Hua performed well in office as he pacified the various non-Han Chinese peoples, such as the Wuhuan and Xianbei tribes, in the region. Although Emperor Wu considered summoning Zhang Hua back to the imperial capital Luoyang to serve in ministerial positions, he changed his mind every time after listening to officials who disliked Zhang Hua. Following Emperor Wu's death in 290, Zhang Hua was summoned back to Luoyang to serve as an Official of Ceremonies (), a position without actual power. His role was mainly to teach Sima Yu, the heir apparent of the newly enthroned Sima Zhong (Emperor Hui). After Empress Jia Nanfeng overthrew Empress Dowager Yang and her father Yang Jun in a coup d'√©tat, she entrusted Zhang Hua with greater responsibilities as Right Household Counsellor (), Palace Attendant () and Supervisor of the Palace Writers (). In 296, Zhang Hua was promoted to Minister of Works (). Over the subsequent years, with Empress Jia Nanfeng in power (Emperor Hui was merely a puppet emperor), Zhang Hua used his political skills to keep the various competing factions in check, in conjunction with Empress Jia's cousin Pei Wei (). Death In 299, the political firestorm became too big for Zhang Hua to handle after Empress Jia Nanfeng framed Sima Yu for treason in 299 and had him deposed. In the following year, fearing that Sima Yu would make a comeback, Empress Jia had him murdered. Sima Lun (the Prince of Zhao), a granduncle of Emperor Hui, plotted a coup d'√©tat to remove Empress Jia from power. He tried to persuade Zhang Hua to join him, but Zhang Hua was reluctant to do so. Later that year, after Sima Lun successfully overthrew Empress Jia, he had her several of her supporters and associates (including Zhang Hua) executed along with their families. Sima Lun then usurped the throne and briefly ruled as emperor before he was overthrown. In 301, Sima You's son, Sima Jiong (the Prince of Qi), then the regent, had Zhang Hua posthumously rehabilitated and restored to his former titles and positions. Poetry Zhang Hua's poetry was admired by such people as Ruan Ji and Chen Liu (). He was profoundly learned, and when he changed houses it took thirty carts to carry his library. Zhang Hua was the author of the Bowuzhi, a collection of articles on various topics of interest. It appears to have perished during the Song dynasty, and the modern work which passes under that name was probably compiled from extracts found in other books. Family Zhang Hua had two sons: Zhang Yi (), who served as a Regular Mounted Attendant (); Zhang Wei (), who served as a Mounted Gentleman (). Both of them died together with their father and the rest of their families in 300. Only one of Zhang Hua's grandsons, Zhang Yu (), survived the purge. He inherited his grandfather's peerage in 301 after his grandfather was posthumously rehabilitated. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

CamelBak is also a supplier of hydration packs, protective gear, and other products to the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies around the world. History In 1989, CamelBak founder Michael Eidson was competing in the \\"Hotter 'n Hell 100\\" bike race in Wichita Falls, Texas. Eidson, who was an EMT by trade, filled an IV bag with water and stuck it in a tube sock. He then pinned the tube sock to the back of his jersey, pulled the tube over his shoulder, and secured it with a clothes pin. Within a few months, Eidson began selling the first CamelBak product, the ThermalBak, which quickly became popular among cyclists. a Therobak in the DPM Pattern in use by a British Soldier U.S. troops took CamelBak products into battle in the first Gulf War and they quickly became a popular product at military exchanges. CamelBak's defense sales grew further during the second Gulf War and the War in Afghanistan. U.S. and foreign government contracts made up about 40% of CamelBak's business as of 2012. CamelBak was sold to San Francisco toymaker Kransco in 1996 for $5 million. Bear Stearns Merchant Banking bought it for $210 million in 2004. In 2006, CamelBak expanded into the water bottle business. The company differentiated its bottles by making them taste-free, using bite valves designed to stop leaks while allowing easy sipping. Eliminating the use of BPA In 2011, water bottles accounted for about 31% of CamelBak's sales. Compass Diversified Holdings, a private equity firm, purchased the company in August 2010 for $258 million. In February 2015, CamelBak filed a patent-infringement suit against Osprey to protect its hands- free reservoir hydration systems. The suit was settled in July 2015 on confidential terms. CamelBak was purchased by Vista Outdoor in July 2015 for $412.5 million. Vista Outdoor was to integrate CamelBak's 300 employees into its outdoor products division. Products =Hydration packs= An example of a civilian CamelBak pack. The blue tube coming off the top enables the wearer to drink from the internal water bladder without removing the pack. CamelBak's hydration packs come in capacities of 1.5 to 3.0 litres (50‚Äì100 US fluid oz) in a backpack style primarily for biking, hiking and other outdoor activities, with smaller belt-type 0.83 to 1.3 litre (28‚Äì45 US fluid oz) packs designed for runners and walkers. CamelBak also makes bottles, general purpose backpacks, and some specialized military and law-enforcement gear, ranging from simple back-worn water reservoirs with little to no cargo capacity, to large rucksacks with various accessories, even PALS webbing to accommodate MOLLE gear. One of CamelBak's military lines features reservoirs that resist chemical and biological weapons; they are designed to be used with gas masks. The United States Army approved the use of CamelBak CBR X hydration packs in November 2015. The Army's office of the Product Manager-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment and the Army's Test and Evaluation Command approved the three-liter CBR X after exposing it to nerve agents for six hours after thirty days of use in the field and then verifying that the water inside remained uncontaminated and performing numerous other tests since 2006. =Water purification= In January 2012, CamelBak started selling its All Clear portable water purification system. All Clear uses ultraviolet light to make untreated water potable in about one minute. In 2014, CamelBak released a filtered water pitcher called the Relay. CamelBak claims that the Relay filters water ten times faster than competing products; this is fast enough to keep up with the flow rate of a kitchen faucet. The Relay uses large pleated filters that last about four months. Operations CamelBak moved to Petaluma, California in 1999. As of 2017, about 150 people work at its headquarters there.

The corporate group has meanwhile been divided into four business units: \\"Delicatessen and Gastronomy\\" (which includes the Stammhaus (original store) in Munich, attracting around 2.8 million visitors per year), \\"Party & Catering,\\" \\"Coffee & Tea\\" and finally \\"Vending & Office\\" (i.e. the sale of drinks and snack vending machines).  History  Alois Dallmayr Anton and Therese Randlkofer The origins of the company can be traced back to the year 1700. At this time, the Munich merchant Christian Reitter ran a business that is considered the direct precursor of the present company. Around 1870, the business came into the ownership of Alois Dallmayr, whose name the company still bears today. He sold the business to Therese and Anton Randlkofer in 1895. Under the management of Therese Randlkofer, a remarkable businesswoman for that time, the Stammhaus (original store) developed into one of the leading delicatessen houses in Europe, with no less than 15 royal purveyor titles. In 1933, Dallmayr‚Äôs coffee era began: In this year, a coffee merchant from Bremen, Konrad Werner Wille, came to Munich and established a specialist coffee department in the \\"Delikatessenhaus Dallmayr\\" that still exists today, which has achieved international renown, amongst other things, due to the television advertisement for Dallmayr Prodomo. The coffee business developed so successfully that in 1985 it was established as a spin-off, the independent subsidiary Alois Dallmayr Kaffee OHG, which represents \\"Coffee & Tea,\\" now the largest business unit in the company. The Nestl√© corporate group acquired an interest in Alois Dallmayr Kaffee OHG to 50%; this was reduced to 25% in 2003. In July 2015, it was agreed that the remaining coffee sector shares should be re-purchased from Nestl√© by Alois Dallmayr KG, but that cooperation was to be continued in sales.  The Dallmayr company today  = Facts and figures = Today, the Alois Dallmayr company headquarters is located in Dienerstra√üe 14‚Äì15 in Munich‚Äôs old town. Florian Randlkofer and Wolfgang Wille both hold responsibility as personally liable shareholders of the parent company, Alois Dallmayr KG. The Dallmayr Group achieved a turnover of around ‚Ç¨900 million for the fiscal year 2014, of which at least ‚Ç¨500 million was generated in the \\"Coffee & Tea\\" business unit, ‚Ç¨360 million in the \\"Vending & Office\\" business unit and ‚Ç¨40 million in the \\"Delicatessen and Gastronomy\\" and \\"Party & Catering\\" business units. The company employs approximately 3,500 employees worldwide, around 2,000 of whom are located in Germany. Dallmayr produces approximately 57,000 tonnes of roast coffee annually at five locations in Germany (Munich, Berlin, Braunschweig, Bremen and Dortmund). The \\"Vending & Office\\" branch of the company operates in 14 countries throughout Europe and in the United Arab Emirates. In December 2009, the Bundeskartellamt (Federal Cartel Office) imposed a fine on Dallmayr and other companies such as Melitta, Tchibo and Kraft due to illegal price fixing, the so-called Kaffeekartell (coffee cartel).[7] = Public commitment and sustainability = Dallmayr is a member of the Common Code for the Coffee Community and supports the Karlheinz B√∂hm Stiftung Menschen f√ºr Menschen (Karlheinz B√∂hm foundation Humans for Humans) and the Jane Goodall Institute. Some coffee types bear the UTZ certified seal, the Biosiegel (organic label), the Fairtrade logo and the logo of the Rainforest Alliance. Furthermore, Dallmayr donates five tree seedlings for every pound sold of their \\"Ethiopia\\" coffee type, to help prevent the desertification of the ground in Ethiopia. In 2011, Dallmayr developed the first sustainable vending machine.  Business units within the company today  = Delicatessen and gastronomy =  The Stammhaus (original store) in Munich  Dallmayr store, 1912 One of the three entrances \\"Der Dallmayr\\", as the Stammhaus in Munich is known, is the largest delicatessen house in Europe. The store is divided into 19 specialist departments (e.g. coffee, pralines, wine, sausage & ham, fruit & vegetable, fish, cheese, bread, pasta, meat, cold & warm buffet, tea, etc.). Due to the television advertisement for the brand Prodomo, the coffee department is the best-known of the departments: Just as in the advertisement, the coffee is still weighed with beam scales today. In the centre of the shop is the Putten (cherubs) fountain, in which crayfish wait to be sold. To a large extent, the goods offered in the Stammhaus are self-produced: On the second floor, there is a production kitchen, in which 70 chefs create gourmet salads, dishes for the warm buffet and cream cakes. The wine department, in which wines in particular from France, Italy, Germany and Austria are sold, was re-designed in 2008. What Dallmayr cannot produce on- site for reasons of space ‚Äì such as smoked salmon or chocolate ‚Äì is produced in their own factories in and around Munich. In Dallmayr‚Äôs praline factory near Munich, more than 40 tonnes of handmade pralines and fruit jellies are produced annually in around 70 different varieties. Furthermore, on 29 June 2003, Dallmayr opened a shop in Terminal 2 of Munich airport , to which a caf√© is also attached. This shop is located behind the security checks, and is only open to air passengers with valid boarding cards. = Restaurant Dallmayr = The \\"Dallmayr\\" restaurant, which focusses on classic-modern cuisine, provides seating for a maximum of 40 people and is located in the first floor of the Stammhaus. It was re-opened in 2006 and is one of the three Munich restaurants that have been accredited with two Michelin stars. Chef de cuisine is Diethard Urbansky. The wine list includes more than 700 items. = Caf√©- Bistro Dallmayr = On the first floor of the Stammhaus, there is also a caf√©-bistro which provides visitors with a classic coffee house atmosphere and a clear view of the Liebfrauendom (Munich Cathedral), the landmark of Munich. Apart from French cream cakes and in-house coffee and tea specialities, classics such as bouillabaisse or \\"lobster thermidor\\" and light lunch dishes are offered. An extensive breakfast menu rounds off the range. = Lukullusbar = The so-called \\"Lukullusbar\\" is also located in the store, and is based on a French market: For example, rock oysters on ice and champagne are available here. = Mail order and gift service = The Stammhaus includes its own packaging station, in which Dallmayr delicatessen items are packaged in gift wrapping. Furthermore, Dallmayr operates an online shop, which delivers products worldwide. = Dallmayr Party & Catering = Dallmayr already had a long tradition as purveyor to the court for numerous royal families. The catering range also includes events with several thousand visitors, and therefore Dallmayr organised, for example, the wedding of Georg Friedrich Prince of Prussia and Sophie Princess of Isenburg in August 2011. Dallmayr coffee on a Deutsche Bahn ICE = Coffee and Tea = Dallmayr Kaffee is one of the best-known coffee brands in Germany. The product brands include, for example, Prodomo, Classic, the Italian coffee line Crema d‚ÄôOro and Ethiopia. Since 2009, the premium line Grand Cru Caf√© has also existed, each of which contains a pure coffee variety such as Jamaican Blue Mountain or Hawaii Kona. Gastronomers are supplied with the Dallmayr Caf√© & Bar product line. Dallmayr is renowned as a processor of mainly washed arabica raw coffee, which the company sources worldwide. Ethiopia has been the most significant supplier for many years as the place of origin for the Coffea arabica plant. Dallmayr roasts approximately 57,000 tonnes of coffee per year at five locations in Germany. With the acquisition of Heimbs Kaffee (1986), the largest and oldest coffee roaster in Lower Saxony, and Azul Kaffee (1997), it was possible for Dallmayr to expand in this field of sophisticated gastronomy. Both companies are independently operating subsidiary companies of Alois Dallmayr Kaffee oHG. Dallmayr also offers over 120 different types of tea. Besides the classic black and green teas, numerous flavoured varieties and a selection of rooibos and fruit teas and herbal tea specialities from South Tyrol are available. Dallmayr is also amongst the first merchants in Germany to offer so-called \\"air freight\\" tea: The first flush of high-quality Darjeeling tea is internationally air-freighted directly after picking. Dallmayr coffee in Dubai = Vending & Office = Under the business designation \\"Vending & Office\\", Dallmayr operates drinks and snack vending machines throughout Germany, across Europe and in the Far East. The first customer was the Munich automobile manufacturer, BMW, who in the 1960s positioned hot drinks vending machines in their production halls: Dallmayr supplied the coffee for these and took over the maintenance of the vending machines. Today, Dallmayr operates over 93,000 vending machines internationally and is therefore, according to their own data, the German market leader, and one of the five largest providers in Europe.

It is affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Livingstone College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Fine Arts, and Bachelor of Social Work degrees. History Livingstone College along with Hood Theological Seminary began as Zion Wesley Institute in Concord, North Carolina in 1879. After fundraising by Dr. Joseph C. Price and Bishop J. W. Hood, the school was closed in Concord and re-opened in 1882 a few miles north in Salisbury. Zion Wesley Institute was founded by the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church. The institute changed its name to Livingstone College in 1887 to honor African missionary David Livingstone. That same year, the school granted its first degree. The first group of students to graduate included eight men and two women, the first black women to earn bachelor's degrees in North Carolina. Originally beginning with 40 acres on a Salisbury farm called Delta Grove, Livingstone College's main campus now consists of 272 acres. In August 2014, Livingstone submitted plans for converting a former Holiday Inn on Jake Alexander Boulevard into a hospitality school. Livingstone‚Äôs School of Hospitality Management & Culinary Arts, a program accredited in 2012, had moved to the new location by 2015. =Livingstone College Historic District= The Livingstone College Historic District is a national historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The district encompasses 16 contributing buildings, 1 contributing structure, and 1 contributing object on the Livingstone College campus and adjacent residential sections in Salisbury. Notable buildings include the Price house (1884), Harris house (1889), Aggrey house (1912), Ballard Hall (1887), Dodge Hall (1886), Carnegie Library (1908), Goler Hall (1917), Hood Building (1910), and Price Memorial Building (1930-1943).  Student activities  The College offers a number of opportunities for students to participate in religious, social, cultural, recreational, and athletic activities. Additionally, outstanding artists and lecturers are brought to campus to perform each year. Included in the Division of Student Services are Residence Life, Health Services, Student Activities/Smith Anderson Clark Student Center, Campus Ministry, and the Counseling Center. = Athletics = On the campus is an athletic marker erected in 1956 to commemorate the first African-American intercollegiate football game, in 1892. Livingstone is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Division II, and the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA). Its intercollegiate sports programs include basketball, bowling, cross-country, football, softball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and track and field. The nickname for the school's teams is the Blue Bears. The Livingstone College football team has had a long history since playing in the first Black college football game in 1892 against Johnson C. Smith University (then called Biddle University). The rivalry between the two schools continues to this day as the Commemorative Classic. The Blue Bears also maintain a rivalry with their cross town rival Catawba College Indians. The early October game between the two schools is called the Mayors' Cup.

A stomp (also referred to as a stamp) is a downwards strike with the heel of the foot from the stand-up position, and is usually directed at the head or body of a downed opponent. A stomp similar to an axe kick is referred to as an axe stomp, while a particularly powerful jumping stomp with both heels is called a bronco kick, and a stomp from the clinch directed at the opponent's foot is called a foot stomp or a heel stomp.  Use in combat sports  Stomping is disallowed in most combat sports. Certain mixed martial arts organizations do, however, allow stomping to different extents. The Ultimate Fighting Championship allows stomps to be performed from the clinch, while stomping on a downed opponent is considered illegal.Ultimate Fighting Championship. This includes stomping with both legs. UFC Rules. www.ufc.tv. URL last accessed February 6, 2006. Although now defunct as a promotion, PRIDE FC rules allowed competitors to stomp on a downed opponent, either to the head or body. Singapore-based ONE Fighting Championship, whose set of rules is essentially a combination of UFC and PRIDE rules, does allow stomps on limbs and trunk of a downed opponent, but not to the head. Stomping is also illegal in football sports, as well as ice hockey. Use in video games Stomping is commonly featured as a primary means of attack in platformers, in which the character's jumping ability is often exaggerated to the point that the character can stomp an enemy's head while it is standing up. A prime example of this is the Mario series, where the technique is the signature move of the franchise's titular hero. Stomping is also a common attack in sandbox and open world games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, where it is most often used to knock out or kill a downed opponent in melee combat. In beat 'em ups such as the Yakuza series, stomping moves are used to damage or finish off enemies that have been knocked to the ground. In the Halo video game series, there are assassinations that the players can use on various enemies that include stomping on the enemy's heads, generally resulting in the kill unless interrupted mid-session. An example would be the \\"Get Low\\" assassination in Halo 5: Guardians, where the player will step on the opponent's left leg and stomping on the enemy's head as the opponent is on their knees facing up. In the Gears of War franchise, both COG troopers and Locusts can perform an execution on downed enemies, leading to a head stomp that completely crushes the Skull in an over-the-top gory mess. This is also commonly found in the survival horror genre, one particular example being Dead Space and later games in the Resident Evil series, used to finish off downed enemies by destroying their particularly squishy heads. This keeps with the lore that a zombie must be dealt with by damaging the brain, and is often encouraged as a means to conserve ammunition and resources. Another example would be in The Last of Us where the character can finish off enemies by performing a brutal stomp to the head.

Biography Sal√≥n de Mayo, 1967. Sidewalk insert in front of Radiocentro CMQ Building by Amelia Pel√°ez. Amelia Pel√°ez was born in 1896 in Yaguajay, in the former Cuban province of Las Villas (now Sancti Sp√≠ritus Province). She was the fifth born of eleven siblings in a family that was part of the Cuban-Creole middle class. Her father was a doctor, Manuel Pelaez y Laredo, and her mother, Maria del Carmen del Casal y Lastra, stayed at home with her children. Amelia's uncle was Julian del Casal, who was a poet and included her family in Cuba's intellectual circles. In 1917, her family moved to Havana, to the La V√≠bora district, and this gave her the opportunity to enter the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes \\"San Alejandro\\" at the rather late age of 20 years (students at this academy usually start at 12‚Äì13 years of age). She was among Leopoldo Roma√±ach's favourite students. In 1924 she graduated from San Alejandro, and exhibited her paintings for the first time, along with another Cuban female painter, Mar√≠a Pepa Lamarque, at the Association of Painters and Sculptors in Havana. Receiving a small government grant, she travelled to New York City in the Summer of 1924 and began six months of study at the Art Students' League. In 1927, after being awarded a larger grant, she began studying in France, while paying short visits to Spain, Italy, and other countries.  Student life in Paris  Pelaez moved to Paris, accompanied by Cuban writer Lydia Cabrera, after her received grant from the government in order to pursue art. Both took painting and art history courses at √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. She also took drawing and art history courses at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re and the √âcole du Louvre. In 1931 Pelaez enrolled, along with Cabrera, in Fernand L√©ger's Academie Contemporaine. She then began studying with Russian painter Alexandra Exter, whose friendship and classes in color theory and design were an important influence.Martinez, Juan A.;Cuban Art & National Identity: The Vanguardia Painters, 1927-1950; University Press of Florida, 1994; Galerie Zak hosted a solo-exhibition of her paintings in 1933, where she exhibited thirty-eight works. In that same year, she participated in the eleventh Salon des Tuileries and ‚Äúwas also included in an exhibition of illustrated manuscripts by the calligrapher Guido at the Galerie Myrbor‚Äù, in which she illustrated Sept Poemes of Leon Paul Fargue. In her years in Paris, her work was highly praised by French critics.  Life in Havana  Mural by Amelia Pel√°ez for the Habana Hilton In 1934, following a showing at the Salon des Independants, Pelaez returned to live in her mother‚Äôs colonial-style house in Cuba. The Cuba Pelaez returned to was in a state economic uncertainty, as well as in an unsettled political climate. Pel√°ez departed from earlier vanguard strategies after her return to Cuba. In the late 1920s, Cuba searched for a new art that would reflect the national identity. In response upon her return, Pelaez turned to strategies that involved depictions of Afro-Cuban and guajiro (peasant) subjects, while representing them in the adoption of European modernism. According to Ingrid Williams Elliot, Pelaez‚Äôs vibrant colors as well as thick lines are derived from Spanish-colonial architecture ‚Äúintegrating domestic objects with architectural decorations‚Äù. Pel√°ez uses \\"Baroque ornamentation in her use of domestic colonial interiors to engage and merge multiple histories and assorted styles -- past and present -- to arrive at a contemporary Cuban idiom.‚Äù In 1935, Pelaez had a solo exhibition at a women‚Äôs club in Havana called the Lyceum, which helped gain exposure of her new modernist Cuban style. During this time, in the mid-thirties, Pel√°ez was experimenting with \\"patterns, shapes and geometric relationships of tablecloths and fruit dishes, laying the groundwork for the geometric constructions and rhythmic patterns that have been associated with her architectural ornamentation in her work in the forties‚Äù, it also shows her awareness of Cubism. Her signature still life paintings were praised for the use of native fruits and flora referencing her Cuban roots. In 1935-1936, Pelaez focused much of her paintings and drawings to the use of ink and pencil. The treatment of these drawings differs than her previous oil works, by distorting and exaggerating the figure with \\"sinuous line and light shading\\" that reference Cubism and European Modernism. Pel√°ez received a prize in the National Exposition of Painters and Sculptors in 1938, and collaborated on several art magazines in Cuba, such as Or√≠genes, Nadie Parec√≠a, and Espuela de Plata. In 1950 she opened a workshop at San Antonio de los Ba√±os, a small city near Havana, where she dedicated herself, until 1962, to her favourite pastime of pottery. She sent her paintings to the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1951 and 1957, and participated in 1952's Venice Biennale. In 1958 she was a guest of honour and jury member at the First Inter-American Biennial of Painting and Printmaking in Mexico City, although she pulled out of the raucous and controversial jury discussions based on what she reported to be ‚Äúan openly Communist bias in the decisions.‚Äù Aside from painting and pottery, she dedicated time to murals, located mainly at different schools in Cuba. Her most important works of this type are a ceramic mural at the Tribunal de Cuentas in Havana (1953) and the facade of the Habana Hilton hotel (1957). She had a hard time selling her paintings as a living artists‚Äîshe and her paintings, later named Amelias, achieved fame much later in life. Pel√°ez died in Havana in 1968.  Estrada Palma 261  Amelia lived in her mother's house, which was a mix between a neoclassical design and a more traditional Cuban Creole architectural style house, for the rest of her years after her return to Havana, Cuba. Her house was a main source of inspiration after returning to a reclusive domestic lifestyle. The house was built in 1912, filled with colonial furniture of the baroque style. The house contained marble, crystal, wood, and ceramics in its interior. Amelia would also hang her paintings as decor.

The reservoir contains a capped mouth for filling with liquid and a hose that allows the wearer to drink hands-free. Most hoses end with a \\"bite valve\\" that opens when the user bites down on it; the valve may be protected by a dust cover. Some hydration packs are insulated to keep water from freezing or becoming warm. Uses The volume of the reservoir and the pack carrying it can vary widely depending on the purpose of the hydration pack. Some packs are extremely small and minimalist, designed to add as little weight as possible and remain secure while running or cycling, while others are more suited for backpacking and extended hikes, equipped with much larger bladders. However, as water weighs 1kg/l (approx. 8.3 lbs/gal), it is impractical to carry more than a few liters in most situations; typical reservoirs are between 1-3 l even for very large backpacks. Besides hydration, water reservoirs may be used for washing dishes or equipment, or for showering. Pressurized hydration bladders are used in some cases to provide a stream powerful enough to effectively wash with, or the bladder may be suspended from a high place such as a tree branch to employ gravity in generating water pressure.

He appeared in the 2012 London Olympics.  Early career  Moore is from Winchester, England. He went to school at King Edward VI, Southampton and studied Economics at University of Nottingham. Throughout his academic career Moore was involved with all sports, showing a particular talent for Hockey and Cricket. At the age of 16 whilst playing a hockey match for his school, the coach for the opposing team, who happened to also be the under 21s coach for England, spotted the young player's natural ability and invited him to an England under 21s trial.  International career  Moore made the England under 21s team the summer of the trials in 1998, and that August was selected for his first tournament; the Under 21s European Cup in Poznan, Poland where the team also managed to pick up a silver medal. Moore's hockey went from strength to strength and in February 2003 aged 21, Moore made his Senior International debut. Since then Moore has racked up an impressive 190 caps for England and Great Britain in tournaments such as; the Olympic Games, Athens Greece (2004), Champions Challenge, Alexandria Egypt (2005), European Championships, Leipzig Germany (2005), Commonwealth Games, Melbourne Australia (2006), World Cup, Monchengladbach Germany (2006), Champions Challenge, Belgium (2007), European Championships, Manchester England (2007), Champions Trophy, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia (2007), Olympic Games, Beijing China (2008), European Championships, Amsterdam Holland (2009), Champions Trophy, Melbourne (2009), World Cup, Delhi India (2010), Champions Trophy, Monchengladbach Germany (2010), Commonwealth Games Delhi India (2010).

His first appearance was in Suicide Squad vol. 1 #1 (1987), he was created by John Ostrander and Luke McDonnell. Publication history Ravan first appears as a member of the villainous mercenary team Jihad (renamed the Onslaught later). In an encounter with the Bronze Tiger his back was broken.Suicide Squad vol. 1 #1 He re-appears alongside the Onslaught in Suicide Squad vol. 1 #17, and is recruited for the Suicide Squad in his second encounter with the Bronze Tiger.Suicide Squad vol. 1 #18 Fictional character biography Part of the thuggee cult, Ravan tries to stop the coming of Kali and thereby the Kali Yuga, the Age of Chaos by killing Kali, in doing so he delays the coming of Kali for another thousand years. It is through this practice that he both prevents and worships Kali. His primary enemy is the villain Kobra who wishes to bring forth the Age of Chaos.Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #1, 33 Ravan joins the Suicide Squad, so he can continue these efforts while actually being sponsored by the American Government.Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #18 He proceeds to develop a strange bond with Bronze Tiger, whom he swears to kill for his earlier defeats, but the two also form an effective team. During the Janus Directive, when Waller must make it seem like she is being controlled by Kobra, she sends the squad after the Force of July; Ravan kills Mayflower, a respected member of the Force of July. Ravan becomes instrumental in Amanda Waller's plan to finish off the LOA, a drug-dealing organization. The villains' plan to expose the Squad succeeds, and it is revealed that Mr. Kale, who was seemingly the new boss, was just a front for Amanda Waller, who had never left power.Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #37-39 With her superiors on the verge of disbanding the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller gathers Ravan, Poison Ivy and Deadshot in an assassination mission targeting the LOA, a group that is planning to create a zombie army. The deal for the villains is simple: the three will help Waller in killing the LOA, and afterward they are set free. The mission succeeds, and Amanda Waller goes to jail on charges of murder, while Ravan leaves for London, where he sets up a 'cyberchurch' as a front for his assassination organization. A year later, Batman kidnaps Ravan from this 'church' (blowing it up in the process) for the new Suicide Squad run again by Amanda Waller.Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #41-43 With this Squad, Ravan goes to Israel in order to capture Kobra. But Kobra has already been captured by the Israeli government's superteam the Hayoth. Ravan easily manipulates one of their agents, thereby giving him access to their highly advanced A.I. computer Dybbuk. While Kobra's plans are being thwarted by the rest of the Suicide Squad, Ravan faces Kobra in combat, but Kobra has the upper hand and is close to killing Ravan. At the last moment, the third Atom appears on the scenes, striking down Kobra. Ravan's last wish is for either him or the Atom to kill Kobra, but Atom denies him that final wish, and as Ravan himself says, he dies unfulfilled. Ravan dies in Suicide Squad #47.Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #45-47 According to Suicide Squad (vol. 2) #11 however, Ravan is incapacitated, rather than deceased, as is shown on a computer screen being viewed by the second Rustam. Assuming this is true, Ravan nevertheless dies for certain sometime thereafter, though the details are not currently known. During the events of Blackest Night, Ravan's corpse is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.Suicide Squad #67 (January 2010) Ravan is apparently destroyed by the Manhunter's self-destruct mechanism when it unleashes an explosion of Green Lantern energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.Secret Six (vol. 3) #18 (February 2010) Other versions A character named Ravan Nassar appears in Arrow Season 2.5 Comics: \\"Haunted\\", \\"Gone\\", Blood part 11 and 12 and \\"Assault\\". Arrow: Season 2.5 #3 In 2012, Kahndaq was liberated by A.R.G.U.S. and a multitude of soldiers, leading to the imprisonment of Ravan at Guantanamo Bay and a lot of sectarian violence. Two years later, an extremist sect named Onslaught began kidnapping and murdering, leading to Lyla Michaels asking Ravan to join the Suicide Squad. Ravan was cleaned up and given clothes and weapons. As they were ready to leave, John Diggle showed up to join them. As they were preparing to drop above the Sinai Peninsula, Diggle questioned Nassar as to what piqued his interest in the mission, considering the nature of the others' membership, being chided for his previous actions as the country's head of military. Once on the ground, they snuck in to the nearby city. They ambushed extremists in the midst of an execution and Ravan, contrary to their initial plans, planted an IED device on one of their trucks, leaving only one, badly-burnt survivor. They took him to a house, tying him up and interrogating him. They requested to know where the resistance leader Khem-Adam was, but he claimed to have no idea. He refused to give up the location, until Diggle intervened, instead talking to him rather than torturing. Being told the Amon-Shu Caves, they rode on camelback, finishing the journey on foot. They broke through in to the caves, fighting off Khem-Adam and his men. However, before Nassar could take on Khem-Adam, a former soldier under his command, he was stopped by two arrows from Nyssa al Ghul, who took Khem-Adam. With Bronze Tiger killed, they escaped to return home. Ravan was returned to his cell at Guantanamo Bay, believing that he had to pay for his past crimes.

Through the works and lives of various artists ‚Äì including H. G. Wells (Mind at the End of Its Tether), Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Harley Granville-Barker (The Secret Life), Hermann Hesse, T. E. Lawrence, Vincent van Gogh, Vaslav Nijinsky, George Bernard Shaw, William Blake, Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and George Gurdjieff ‚Äì Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society, and society's effect on him. On Christmas Day, 1954, alone in his room, Wilson sat down on his bed and began to write in his journal. He described his feelings as follows: The Outsider has been translated into over thirty languages (including Russian and Chinese) and never been out of print since publication day of 28 May 1956. Wilson wrote much of it in the Reading Room of the British Museum, and during this period was, for a time, living in a sleeping bag on Hampstead Heath. He continued to work on it at a furious pace and: Gollancz was the head of publishers Victor Gollancz Ltd. Wilson was inspired to send the book to him after he found a copy of the publisher's own book A Year of Grace in a second-hand bookshop, which led him to believe that he had found a sympathetic publisher.The angry years: the rise and fall of the angry young men by Colin Wilson, pps. 15‚Äì16 Robson, 2007,  Contents  The book is structured in order to mirror the Outsider's experience: a sense of dislocation, or of being at odds with society. These are figures like Dostoyevsky's \\"Underground-Man\\" who seem to be lost to despair and non- transcendence with no way out. Characters are then brought to the fore (including the title character from Hermann Hesse‚Äôs novel Steppenwolf). These are presented as examples of those who have insightful moments of lucidity in which they feel as though things are worthwhile/meaningful amidst their shared, usual, experience of nihilism and gloom. Sartre's Nausea is herein the key text ‚Äì and the moment when the hero listens to a song in a cafe which momentarily lifts his spirits is the outlook on life to be normalized. Wilson then engages in some detailed case studies of artists who failed in this task and try to understand their weakness ‚Äì which is either intellectual, of the body or of the emotions. The final chapter is Wilson's attempt at a \\"great synthesis\\" in which he justifies his belief that western philosophy is afflicted with a needless pessimistic fallacy.  Commentary  The book has never been out of print since publication day in May 1956 and has been translated into at least 30 languages. Wilson helped to keep the work fresh by adding to it over the years: the 1967 paperback edition included a fifteen- page postscript; a ten-page essay 'The Outsider, twenty years on' was added to the 1978 edition; and in 2001 an index appeared for the first time alongside fifteen pages of postscripts originally written for a Chinese translation. It is still published with enthusiastic comments from the likes of Edith Sitwell and Cyril Connolly adorning its cover. This reception ‚Äì of his first book at the age of 24 ‚Äì was a high critical watermark for Wilson which he did not achieve again until the publication of The Occult in 1971 after which he enjoyed a long and fruitful career as a writer, philosopher, novelist, lecturer and broadcaster until his death in 2013.  Sequels  Wilson followed The Outsider with six philosophical titles, which have become known as The Outsider Cycle: Religion and the Rebel (1957), The Age of Defeat (The Stature of Man in the U.S., 1959), The Strength to Dream (1962), Origins of the Sexual Impulse (1963), Beyond the Outsider (1965) and the summary volume Introduction to the New Existentialism (1966). These were accompanied by a string of novels aimed at putting his philosophical ideas into action.

A downed opponent (also called a grounded opponent) is a combatant that is on the ground, as compared to a combatant that is in a standing position. This commonly implies that the downed combatant is lying on the ground, but can technically refer to any position in which anything except the soles of the combatants feet are touching the ground. In many combat sports featuring striking, such as boxing or taekwondo, it is illegal to strike a downed opponent. The referee will promptly bring the downed opponent to his or her feet to resume the bout standing. The only combat sport which allows strikes when the opponent is down is mixed martial arts. The majority of MMA organizations follows the common rule of prohibiting knee strikes and kicks to the head of a grounded opponent, but fighters are allowed to strike their opponent's body. Hand and elbows strikes to the head are considered legal. There are many MMA organizations that still follows the roots of MMA which is no-holds-barred fighting. Brazil, Japan and Russia are the three main countries that allow soccer kicks to the face/head when the opponent is down as well as knees to the head of a downed opponent.

The Latvian Constitution prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriages. Partnership On 23 September 1999, the Latvian National Human Rights Office presented a registered partnership bill to the Saeima (Parliament). On 28 September 1999, the proposal was sent to the Human Rights and Public Affairs Commission of the Saeima for discussion.LATVIA: PARTNERSHIP LAW PRESENTED TO THE MEDIA AND SENT TO PARLIAMENTLATVIA: PROGRESS ON PARTNERSHIP LAW On 30 November 1999, the commission rejected the bill.LATVIA KILLS PARTNER MEASURE In January 2012, the Ombudsman's Office (the renamed National Human Rights Office since 2007) recommended that the Parliament not introduce same-sex registered partnerships. Letter No. 1-8/4 to parliamentary committees on human rights and legal affairs by the Ombudsman J. Jansons 26 January 2012 However, after Baltic Pride in June 2012, it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice was considering whether to recognise same-sex partnerships, either through unregistered cohabitation () or registered partnership (reƒ£istrƒìtƒÅs partnerattiecƒ´bƒÅs). Defence Minister Artis Pabriks indicated his support for registered partnerships. Mozaika, Latvia's largest gay rights organisation, predicted that it would take approximately five years to obtain enough political support to pass the bill. In November 2014, while commenting on the coming out of Minister for Foreign Affairs Edgars Rinkƒìviƒçs and on his call for recognition of same-sex relationships, Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma reaffirmed her support for the constitutional prohibition on same-sex marriage. She also admitted that \\"Latvian law has not yet resolved the question of partner-relationships\\", explaining that non-recognition of unmarried couples affects many in Latvia regardless of sexual orientation and that protection of such families needs to be discussed by both the community and the Saeima. On 30 January 2015, Veiko Spolƒ´tis, an MP from the New Unity party, submitted a bill to modify the Civil Code to legalise recognised partnerships. The proposed law would have allowed \\"any two persons\\" to register their partnership and have almost the same rights and obligations as married couples. The proposal was rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee on 24 February 2015. On 23 March 2015, For Latvia's Development chairperson, Juris P≈´ce, launched a signature collection campaign on ManaBalss.lv for the adoption of a cohabitation law in Latvia. The draft bill stated that the registration of couples' cohabitations would secure equal rights to all members of society, regardless of gender. The signatures were submitted to the Saeima in January 2018. In March 2018, the Mandate, Ethics and Submissions Committee (MandƒÅtu, ƒìtikas un iesniegumu komisija) recommended that the initiative be rejected by the Saeima. 5 out of the 9 deputies voted to recommend rejection, while others wanted further consideration.

Only 23 members voted for the bill, 60 voted against it and one member abstained, with support coming from Development/For! and New Unity, plus some Social Democratic Party \\"Harmony\\" members. The Social Democratic Party \\"Harmony\\", Who Owns the State?, the New Conservative Party, the National Alliance \\"All For Latvia!\\" ‚Äì \\"For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK\\" and the Union of Greens and Farmers as well as several independents were opposed. Supporters of the bill have said that they will persevere and try to persuade deputies to discuss it again in the future. Marriage =Constitution= In December 2005, the Saeima voted 65-5 to approve an amendment to the Constitution, banning same-sex marriage. The amendment took effect on 17 January 2006. Article 110 reads: \\"The State shall protect and support marriage ‚Äî a union between a man and a woman, the family, the rights of parents and rights of the child\\". =Legal challenges= On 27 May 2016, the Constitutional Court of Latvia overturned an administrative court decision to refuse an application to register a same-sex marriage in the country. A Supreme Court press spokeswoman said that the court agrees with the administrative court that current regulations do not allow for same-sex marriages to be legally performed in Latvia. However, the matter should have been considered in a context not of marriage, but of registering familial partnership. Furthermore, it would have been impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights weren't violated unless their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner. The Supreme Court will now decide whether the refusal was in breach of the Latvian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. =2018 European Court of Justice ruling= On 5 June 2018, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that European Union member states (including Latvia) must recognise the freedom of movement and residency rights of same-sex spouses, provided one partner is an EU citizen.EU states must recognize foreign same-sex marriages: court, Reuters, June 5, 2018Rights for same-sex married couples to move around the EU confirmed in landmark ruling, Yahoo News, June 6, 2018 The Court ruled that EU member states may choose whether or not to allow same-sex marriage, but they cannot obstruct the freedom of residence of an EU citizen and their spouse. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the term \\"spouse\\" is gender-neutral, and that it does not necessarily imply a person of the opposite sex.JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber) 5 June 2018 The Latvian Government and the Pilsonƒ´bas un migrƒÅcijas lietu pƒÅrvaldƒì (Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs) follow and abide by this directive.

Park Street has a petrol station, several tyre and automotive service businesses and two food-serving public houses; it is of late and initially disparate medieval origin.Park Street's nearby Anglican church of the Holy Trinity, originally simply named 'a chapel of ease to St Stephen' was built in 1841-2 is in the heart of Frogmore but was according to the listing entry research by English Heritage built to serve the more than 2000 scattered parishioners of the by parish of St Stephen, St Albans, where only 3 poor outlying cottages were within one mile of St Stephens, now a close suburb of St Albans in the 1840s, see Holy Trinity Church, on the Frogmore border The village is also home to the penultimate station on the Abbey Line from Watford Junction, which opened in 1858. Park Street is also a larger local government ward (the largest settlement of which is How Wood and which includes part of Bricket Wood). The area falls within the Metropolitan Green Belt. Residents are mainly employed in nearby cities and east of the street in Frogmore is a substantial business centre and light industrial estate. Location Park Street is approximately 2¬Ω miles by road from St Albans via Watling Street (the old Roman road from London to Chester and Holyhead) and then a post-Roman offshoot, St Stephen's Hill, into the medieval city centre. Just south of the A405/A414 North Orbital Road, Hertfordshire which has a direct spur to the M25 (J21A) and Watford, the A405, road links and rail links are within the village boundaries. The A405, A414, A5183 (formerly A5, Watling Street) and the former M10 motorway (now numbered as part of the A414 as of 1 May 2009), join at Park Street Roundabout. This was featured for many years in the road signs section of the Highway Code. To the east and south-east of the village lies the disused Handley Page aerodrome.  Origin of the name  It is thought unlikely the name 'Park' comes from the usual meaning of an enclosure of land for the purpose of hunting but rather simply designates an enclosure of some kind derived from the Saxon word for enclosure which is ‚Äòpearroc‚Äô. The village lies on the Roman Road of Watling Street which forms the main street and continued as a trunk route for travellers going to and from the north from London during Saxon and Norman times.  History  The immediate village has fourteen heritage-listed buildings (one of which is half-timbered) on Watling Street ‚Äì the majority of the rest being brick built early Victorian buildings ‚Äì though Toll Cottage on Bury Dell just to the east is 17th century. Most significantly to this area would have been the passing trade for villagers to sell their ale and produce along Watling Street and easy access to the markets in the nearby pre-Roman settlement, see History of St Albans. Queen Elizabeth I's spy master Sir Francis Walsingham lived at nearby Old Parkbury, south of the village which was the manor house. There used to be a Sub Post-Office and more shops, however both How Wood and St Albans provide a larger range of shops. Landmarks The main landmark in the village is a Mill, which was converted into offices in 1984. During the conversion a World War II bomb was found in the \\"Old Smithy's\\" garden. There is a Village Hall, accessed from the A5183. Opened in 1936 it is the polling station. Park Street Baptist Church is on Penn Road. Railway station Park Street Railway Station Park Street railway station is the first station after St Albans Abbey on the St Albans Branch Line. The train service on this line is known locally as the 'Abbey Flyer'. The railway was built in 1858 as a branch line from the London & Birmingham Railway, and Park Street station has been on its current site since 1890. Before being moved to its current position, on Watling Street, it was situated just near Hyde Lane off Park Street Lane, near the current How Wood station. There was another railway line, built in 1866, which linked the above London and North Western Railway branch line to St Albans, to the newly constructed Midland Railway's main line from Bedford to St Pancras, at Napsbury. It was a goods line in brief use, closed by 1910, called the Park Street Branch and was operated by the Midland Railway. The railway bridge near Sycamore Drive was demolished around 1948 after being damaged by a giant propellor being delivered to the Handley Page aircraft works. It is still possible to see some of the bridge brickwork here which is just by The Overdraught pub. Another, over the River Ver at the back of Sycamore Drive, still survives. Beyond the bridge over the River Ver this line crossed what became the Handley Page aircraft factory runway. This runway was in use until the mid-1960s for the maintenance and testing of the V bomber fleet. A 1960s metal bridge carries the Abbey Line trains, sometimes affectionately dubbed the Abbey Flyer, over the main road, replacing a previous brick one. Schools Park Street has two primary schools, Park Street Church of England Primary School and How Wood Primary School. The nearest secondary school is Marlborough School, near the King Harry public house in St Albans. Public houses There are now only two pubs in the village: The Falcon and The Overdraught. There were previously seven other pubs in Park Street/Frogmore/Colney Street: The Red Lion closed in 2009, and The Swan closed in 2008. In Frogmore, The Red Cow closed in 2001/02, and The Lamb closed in the early 1970s. In Colney Street there used to be three pubs: The Black Horse, which was demolished in 2003; The George and Dragon, which closed in the early 1990s; and The Jolly Farmer, which closed in the 1930s. The Overdraught used to be called The White Horse. Until the early 1970s, The Lamb was situated opposite the entrance to the Handley Page aircraft factory (now Frederick Place). Once the factory closed the last landlord couldn't make a living and, so legend has it (widely-held story in the village at the time), he and his wife closed the pub, locked themselves in and drank the pub dry before being ordered out by the brewery. The pub's building still exists as a private residence. The Lamb building still stands, almost opposite Holy Trinity Church. It is now divided into three flats. The Falcon is reputed to be on the site of a \\"Pilgrim's Rest\\", which was a series of places to house the pilgrims to St Alban's shrine in the 1600s. Parks and sport Park Street has three parks: *Recreation Ground by sports fields on Park Street Lane: Park Street Football Club and the cricket (sport) ground and pavilion. *Mayflower Road Park *Frogmore Lakes Park, to the south of the village just past the gravel pits, popular for fishing. There also used to be a big park along Burydell/ Bury Dell Lane, replaced by the vegetable allotments, this was in use at least until 1900.

Dots represent scores from individual participants. From From P300 Development across the Lifespan: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. The latency and amplitude of the P300 response may vary as a function of age. The P300 response of different healthy subjects in a two-tone auditory oddball paradigm. The plots show the average response to oddball (red) and standard (blue) trials and their difference (black). From Surprise response as a probe for compressed memory states. These examples show the significant individual variability in amplitude, latency and waveform shape across different subjects. The P300 (P3) wave is an event-related potential (ERP) component elicited in the process of decision making. It is considered to be an endogenous potential, as its occurrence links not to the physical attributes of a stimulus, but to a person's reaction to it. More specifically, the P300 is thought to reflect processes involved in stimulus evaluation or categorization. It is usually elicited using the oddball paradigm, in which low-probability target items are mixed with high- probability non-target (or \\"standard\\") items. When recorded by electroencephalography (EEG), it surfaces as a positive deflection in voltage with a latency (delay between stimulus and response) of roughly 250 to 500 ms. The signal is typically measured most strongly by the electrodes covering the parietal lobe. The presence, magnitude, topography and timing of this signal are often used as metrics of cognitive function in decision-making processes. While the neural substrates of this ERP component still remain hazy, the reproducibility and ubiquity of this signal makes it a common choice for psychological tests in both the clinic and laboratory.  History  Early observations of the P300 (more specifically, the component that would later be named the P3b) were reported in the mid-1960s. In 1964, researchers Chapman and Bragdon found that ERP responses to visual stimuli differed depending on whether the stimuli had meaning or not. They showed subjects two kinds of visual stimuli: numbers and flashes of light. Subjects viewed these stimuli one at a time in a sequence. For every two numbers, the subjects were required to make simple decisions, such as telling which of the two numbers was numerically smaller or larger, which came first or second in the sequence, or whether they were equal. When examining evoked potentials to these stimuli (i.e., ERPs), Chapman and Bragdon found that both the numbers and the flashes elicited the expected sensory responses (e.g., visual N1 components), and that the amplitude of these responses varied in an expected fashion with the intensity of the stimuli. They also found that the ERP responses to the numbers, but not to the light flashes, contained a large positivity that peaked around 300 ms after the stimulus appeared. Chapman and Bragdon speculated that this differential response to the numbers, which came to be known as the P300 response, resulted from the fact that the numbers were meaningful to the participants, based on the task that they were asked to perform. In 1965, Sutton and colleagues published results from two experiments that further explored this late positivity. They presented subjects with either a cue that indicated whether the following stimulus would be a click or a flash, or a cue which required subjects to guess whether the following stimulus would be a click or a flash. They found that when subjects were required to guess what the following stimulus would be, the amplitude of the \\"late positive complex\\" was larger than when they knew what the stimulus would be. In a second experiment, they presented two cue types. For one cue there was a 2 in 3 chance that the following stimulus would be a click and a 1 in 3 chance that the following stimulus would be a flash. The second cue type had probabilities that were the reverse of the first. They found that the amplitude of the positive complex was larger in response to the less probable stimuli, or the one that only had a 1 in 3 chance of appearing. Another important finding from these studies is that this late positive complex was observed for both the clicks and flashes, indicating that the physical type of the stimulus (auditory or visual) did not matter. In later studies published in 1967, Sutton and colleagues had subjects guess whether they would hear one click or two clicks. They again observed a positivity around 300 ms after the second click occurred ‚Äì or would have occurred, in the case of the single click. They also had subjects guess how long the interval between clicks might be, and in this case, the late positivity occurred 300 ms after the second click. This shows two important findings: first, that this late positivity occurred when uncertainty about the type of click was resolved, and second, that even an absence of a stimulus would elicit the late positive complex, if said stimulus was relevant to the task. These early studies encouraged the use of ERP methods to study cognition and provided a foundation for the extensive work on the P300 in the decades that followed.  P3a and P3b  The P300 response as a function of the oddball probability. From Surprise response as a probe for compressed memory states. The ERP shows a larger P300 response magnitude to oddball stimuli and a lower P300 response to standard stimuli as the oddball probability decreases. The P3a, or novelty P3, has a positive- going amplitude that displays maximum amplitude over frontal/central electrode sites and has a peak latency in the range of 250‚Äì280 ms. The P3a has been associated with brain activity related to the engagement of attention (especially the orienting, involuntary shifts to changes in the environment), and the processing of novelty. The P3b has a positive-going amplitude (usually relative to a reference behind the ear or the average of two such references) that peaks at around 300 ms, and the peak will vary in latency from 250 to 500 ms or more, depending upon the task and the individual subject response. Amplitudes are typically highest on the scalp over parietal brain areas. The P3b has been a prominent tool used to study cognitive processes, especially psychology research on information processing. Generally speaking, improbable events will elicit a P3b, and the less probable the event, the larger the P3b amplitude. This was shown to be true both for the overall probability and for the local probability. However, in order to elicit a P3b, the improbable event must be related to the task at hand in some way (for example, the improbable event could be an infrequent target letter in a stream of letters, to which a subject might respond with a button press). The P3b can also be used to measure how demanding a task is on cognitive workload. Since the initial discovery of the P300, research has shown that the P300 has two subcomponents. The subcomponents are the novelty P3, or P3a, and the classic P300, which has since been renamed P3b.  Applications  Since the mid-1980s, one of the most discussed uses of ERPs such as the P300 is related to lie detection. In a proposed \\"guilty knowledge test\\" a subject is interrogated via the oddball paradigm much as they would be in a typical lie-detector situation. This practice has recently enjoyed increased legal permissibility while conventional polygraphy has seen its use diminish, in part owing to the unconscious and uncontrollable aspects of the P300. The technique relies on reproducible elicitation of the P300 wave, central to the idea of a Memory and Encoding Related Multifaceted Electroencephalographic Response (MERMER) developed by Dr. Lawrence Farwell. Applications in brain-computer interfacing (BCI) have also been proposed. The P300 has a number of desirable qualities that aid in implementation of such systems. First, the waveform is consistently detectable and is elicited in response to precise stimuli. The P300 waveform can also be evoked in nearly all subjects with little variation in measurement techniques, which may help simplify interface designs and permit greater usability. The speed at which an interface is able to operate depends on how detectable the signal is despite \\"noise.\\" One negative characteristic of the P300 is that the amplitude of the waveform requires averaging of multiple recordings to isolate the signal. This and other post- recording processing steps determine the overall speed of an interface. The algorithm proposed by Farwell and Donchin provides an example of a simple BCI that relies on the unconscious decision making processes of the P300 to drive a computer. A 6√ó6 grid of characters is presented to the subject, and various columns or rows are highlighted. When a column or row contains the character a subject desires to communicate, the P300 response is elicited (since this character is \\"special\\" it is the target stimulus described in the typical oddball paradigm). The combination of the row and column which evoked the response locates the desired character. A number of such trials must be averaged to clear noise from the EEG. The speed of the highlighting determines the number of characters processed per minute. Results from studies using this setup show that normal subjects could achieve a 95% success rate at 3.4‚Äì4.3 chars/min. Such success rates are not limited to non-disabled users; a study conducted in 2000 revealed that 4 paralyzed participants (one with complete paraplegia, three with incomplete paraplegia) performed as successfully as 10 normal participants. Scientific research often relies on measurement of the P300 to examine event related potentials, especially with regard to decision making. Because cognitive impairment is often correlated with modifications in the P300, the waveform can be used as a measure for the efficacy of various treatments on cognitive function. Some have suggested its use as a clinical marker for precisely these reasons. There is a broad range of uses for the P300 in clinical research.

It is a mitzvah de'oraita (Aramaic: ), that is written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 8:10). Birkat Hamazon is recited after a meal containing bread or similar foods that is made from the five grains, with the exception of bread that comes as a dessert (pas haba'ah b'kisanin)Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 168:6 and food that does not possess the form or appearance of bread (torisa d'nahama),Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 168:11. See the Rema's gloss, which defines what torisa denahama means. in which case a blessing that summarizes the first three blessings (birkat me'ein shalosh) is recited instead. It is a matter of rabbinic dispute whether birkat hamazon must be said after eating certain other bread-like foods such as pizza.Pizza and birkat hamazon Except when in teaching situations, Birkat hamazon is typically read individually after ordinary meals. Sometimes it's also sung aloud on special occasions such as the Shabbat and festivals. The blessing can be found in almost all prayerbooks and is often printed in a variety of artistic styles in a small booklet called a birchon (or birkon, ) in Hebrew or bencher (or bentscher) in Yiddish. The length of the different Birkat hamazon can vary considerably, from bentsching under half a minute to more than 5 minutes.The shortest known Birkat Hamazon would be that in the Siddur of Saadia Gaon. From: Source and text The scriptural source for the requirement to recite a blessing after a meal is Deuteronomy 8:10 \\"When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He gave you\\". The process is often referred to as bentsching; the word \\"bentsch\\" means to bless. Birkat Hamazon is made up of four blessings. The first three blessings are regarded as required by scriptural law: #The food: A blessing of thanks for the food was traditionally composed by Moses (Berakhot 48b) in gratitude for the manna which the Jews ate in the wilderness during the Exodus from Egypt. #The land: A blessing of thanks for the Land of Israel, is attributed to Joshua after he led the Jewish people into Israel. #Jerusalem: Concerns Jerusalem, is ascribed to David, who established it as the capital of Israel and Solomon, who built the Temple in Jerusalem.There is yet another way to understand the progression of these three blessings. The \\"HaZon\\" blessing signifies completeness from the standpoint of the [physical] laws of nature; people by nature need food. Completeness in terms of the land, however, while possessing a physical component, is also completeness from a spiritual and Godly standpoint. It is known, for example that the atmosphere of Israel sharpens the mind; this in addition to other characteristics [that are of a spiritual nature]. This needs no further elaboration. Nonetheless, even though the completeness inherent in giving us the land of Israel has a spiritual component, it is not entirely spiritual as are Yerushalayim and the Temple. The holy city of Yerushalayim and the Temple, the holy and Godly abode, are unadulterated spiritual completeness. That is why, as our Sages taught, ten miracles occurred in the Temple. The essence of the Temple is pure holiness and Yisroel‚Äôs [possession of the Temple] positions them at the height of holiness as well. This explanation is similar to the preceding one. All three of these forms of completeness are appropriate for the after-meals blessings because these blessings were established to acknowledge fulfillment ‚Äì Hashem completes us by supplying our lacks ‚Äì and [with the elements that are described in] these three blessings we are sated and rendered complete in all respects (Willner, Eliakim. Nesivos Olam, Nesiv HaAvodah (Maharal of Prague): The philosophy and practice of prayer (Chapter 18) #God's goodness: A blessing of thanks for God's goodness, written by Rabban Gamliel in Yavneh. The obligation to recite this blessing is generallyThe article ends \\"Excerpted from Windows To the Soul ... ArtScroll\\" regarded as a rabbinic obligation. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook described the order of these four blessings as a ‚Äúladder of prayer,‚Äù as we raise our sights and aspirations. The first blessing refers to one's personal needs; the second, the physical needs of the nation (through the Land of Israel); the third, the nation‚Äôs spiritual aspirations (Jerusalem and the Temple); and the fourth blessing, our ultimate aspiration to be a ‚Äúlight unto the nations.‚Äù The statutory birkat hamazon ends at the end of these four blessings, with the words, al yechasrenu.Grace after meals. After these four blessings, there is a series of short prayers, each beginning with the word Harachaman (the Merciful One), which ask for God's compassion. There are several known texts for birkat hamazon. The most widely available is the Ashkenazic. There are also Sephardic, Yemenite and Italian versions. All of these texts follow the same structure described above, but the wording varies. In particular, the Italian version preserves the ancient practice of commencing the second paragraph with Nachamenu on Shabbat. =Preliminary psalms= * On weekdays, some recite Psalm 137, Al Naharot Bavel (By the rivers of Babylon) before Birkat Hamazon. This psalm describes the reactions of the Jews in exile as would have been expressed during the Babylonian captivity (See Mishna Berura quoting the Shelah). * Psalm 126, eponymously called Shir Hama'alot (Song of Ascents), which expresses the Jewish hope of return to Zion following their final redemption, is widely recited by Ashkenazi Jews before Birkat Hamazon on Shabbat, Jewish holidays, and certain other days or special occasions (such as weddings, Brit Millah, Pidyon HaBen). Some follow this by two or four additional verses from Psalms (145:21; 115:18; 118:1; 106:2); this addition is known as Tehillat Hashem after its first words, and is based on teachings by the Arizal.Birkat Hamazon: Preliminary Tehillim Some Spanish and Portuguese Jews precede Birkat Hamazon with \\"Ein Keloheinu\\" on Shabbat and holidays. * Tzur Mishelo Achalnu is sung in some communities as \\"as an introduction to the Grace after Meals in all joyous occasions.\\" Whereas it is commonly found among the songs printed for singing Friday night,ArtScroll among those who use it for zimun it is never sung in the middle of a meal, since it would signal the meal's end. =Shabbat and Holidays= Additional sections are added on special occasions. * On Shabbat the retzei paragraph is recited, just before the end of the third blessing. * On Jewish holidays, the ya'aleh ve-Yavo paragraph is added in the same placeAfter \\"ReTzei\\" on Shabbat * On Hanukkah and Purim al ha-Nissim is added to the middle of the second blessing.Some Religious Zionist communities also add versions of \\"al Ha-Nissim\\" on Yom HaAtzmaut and Yom Yerushalayim. If one forgets Retzei or ya'aleh ve-Yavo, one inserts a short blessing before the fourth blessing. If this is also forgotten, then at the first two meals of Shabbat and major holidays (with the possible exception of the Rosh Hashanah day meal), one must repeat the entire Birkat Hamazon. At later meals, or on Rosh Chodesh or Chol Hamoed, nothing need be done. If one forgets al ha- Nissim, one does not repeat Birkat Hamazon, although one recites a special Harachaman toward the very end, followed by the paragraph Bimei, which describes the respective holidays. If this prayer is also forgotten, nothing need be done. =Sheva Brachot= When birkat hamazon takes place at the Sheva Brachot (seven blessings) following a traditional Jewish marriage, special opening lines reflecting the joy of the occasion are added to the zimmun (invitation to grace) beginning with Devai Haser. At the conclusion of birkat hamazon, a further seven special blessings are recited. =Brit milah= At birkat hamazon concluding the celebratory meal of a brit milah (ritual circumcision), additional introductory lines, known as Nodeh Leshimcha, are added at the beginning and special ha-Rachaman prayers are inserted. =Abbreviated text= An abbreviated text is sometime used when time is lacking. It contains the four essential blessings in a somewhat shortened form, with fewer preliminaries and additions. In liberal branches of Judaism, there is no standard text to be recited and customs vary accordingly. Many Sephardi Jews, especially Spanish and Portuguese Jews often sing a hymn in Spanish (not Ladino as is commonly assumed), called Bendigamos, before or after birkat hamazon. An additional abbreviated form of birkat hamazon in Ladino, called Ya Comimos, may also be said. Zimmun According to Halakha when a minimum of three adult Jewish males eat bread as part of a meal together they are obligated to form a mezuman (a \\"prepared gathering\\") with the addition of a few extra opening words whereby one man \\"invites\\" the others to join him in birkat hamazon. (This invitation is called a zimmun). When those present at the meal form a minyan (a quorum of ten adult Jewish men) there are further additions to the invitation. A Zimmun of 10 is called a Zimmun B'Shem. The zimmun is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a mezuman. =Women= The Talmud states that women are obligated to say birkat hamazon and that accordingly, three women can constitute a zimmun and lead it.Berachot 45b Accordingly, the Shulchan Aruch rules that three women may choose to make a zimmun among themselves, but are not required to do so.Orach Chayyim 199:6-7 However, ten women cannot make the Zimmun B'Shem,Frimer, \\"Women and Minyan\\" and men and women cannot combine to form the three members of an ordinary zimmun.Chaim Navon, Women and Zimmun If three men and three women are present, the three men make the zimmun, and the women are required to answer to it. =Large gatherings= According to the one opinion in the Talmud,Berakhot 49b there are special versions of the zimmun if birkat hamazon is said by at least 100, 1000 or 10000 seated at one meal. When 100 are present, the leader says \\"Blessed is HaShem our God, of Whose we have eaten and of Whose goodness we have lived\\", and the group responds \\"Blessed is HaShem our God, of Whose we have eaten, and of Whose goodness we have lived.\\" When 1000 are present, the leader of the Zimmun says \\"Let us bless HaShem our God, the God of Israel, of Whose we have eaten, and of Whose goodness we have lived\\", and the crowd responds, \\"Blessed is HaShem our God, the God of Israel, of Whose we have eaten, and of Whose goodness we have lived.\\" When at least 10000 are present, the leader of the zimmun says \\"Let us bless Hashem our God, the God of Israel, who dwells among the cherubim, of Whose we have eaten, and of Whose goodness we have lived,\\" and the multitude responds, \\"Blessed is Hashem our God, the God of Israel, who dwells among the cherubim, of Whose we have eaten, and of Whose goodness we have lived.\\" However, the Shulchan Aruch rules that none of these variations are used in practice nowadays.Orach Chaim 192:1 =Cup of Blessing= It is customary for the person leading the zimmun to recite the blessings over a cup of wine called the kos shel beracha (cup of blessing). Although sometimes done at ordinary meals, it is more commonly done on Shabbat and Jewish Holidays, and almost universally done at meals celebrating special events. At a Passover Seder, the cup of blessing is drunk by everyone present, and functions as the \\"Third Cup\\". The practice of a cup of blessing is mentioned in the Talmud.see Pesachim 119a. Mayim Acharonim There is a practice in many Orthodox communities to wash the hands before reciting birkat hamazon. This practice is called mayim acharonim (final waters). While the Talmud and Shulchan Aruch rule this practice to be obligatory, Tosafot and other sources rule it to be unnecessary in current circumstances, and thus many do not perform the practice. Bentschers Bentschers /Ààb…õn¬∑ ß…ô…π/ (or benchers, birkhonim, birkhon, birchon, birchonim) are small Birkat Hamazon booklets usually handed out at bar and bat mitzvahs, weddings and other celebratory events. Traditionally, the cover of the bentscher is customized to reflect the event. Some bentschers now feature photography of Israel throughout. There are several services currently available that customize the bentscher using graphics, logos and/or photographs. Traditions The Talmud relates that at the time of the Resurrection of the Dead, a special feast will take place. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and Joshua will all claim unworthiness to lead the grace and the Cup of Blessing will pass to King David, who will accept the honour.Pesachim 119b. Origin The giving of thanks for the food received dates back to the first Jewish Patriarch, Abraham. A Midrash says that his tent for hospitality had openings on all four sides. He invited guests bless the Heavenly source of the food. If they refused, he told them that he would have to pay 10 gold coins for bread, ten for wine and ten for hospitality. To their amazement for the excessive price he replied that that price corresponded to those delights difficult to find in the desert; then they accepted God and thanked Him.Medrash See also *List of Jewish prayers and blessings References External links *Brachos.org - Blessing after Bread *Birchas Hamazon - Blessing after Bread *Jewish Virtual Library: Laws of Grace After Meals Jewish prayer and ritual texts Jewish blessings Positive Mitzvoth Hebrew words and phrases in Jewish prayers and blessings Hebrew words and phrases in Jewish law ","title":"Birkat Hamazon"},{"id":"3522942","text":"The house in Sofia, 10 Ivan Asen II str., where Ran Bosilek has lived and worked from 1923 to 1958 Ran Bosilek () (26 September 1886 in Gabrovo - 8 October 1958 in Sofia), born Gencho Stanchev Negentsov (), was a Bulgarian author of children's books.

The Grand Narrows Bridge of the Intercolonial Railway at the centre of the photo, with swing span open to permit shipping to transit the Barra Strait.Grand Narrows. The large building is the Grand Narrows Hotel, still standing and appearing much like this and used now as a Bed & Breakfast (in 2018). The Hotel was located here as the Intercolonial Railway crossed the Grand Narrows of the Bras d'Or lake at this location so many passengers transferred between the railway and passenger steamers on the lake here. Grand Narrows () (2001 population 15) is a community in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia, Canada. The community is the birthplace of the longest serving Premier of Nova Scotia, George Henry Murray. The Barra Strait Marina is here, operated by the Grand Narrows Waterfront Development Society. Origin of name The community is named to describe the wide strait or \\"Grand Narrows\\" of Bras d'Or Lake, known as the Barra Strait, between it and Iona. History Hector McNeil was one of the first to settle here about 1804, followed soon after by others originally from Barra in Scotland. Archibald McDougall was the teacher at the narrows by 1830, and a good school had been provided by 1839. A Postal Way Office was established in 1851. The community came to prominence during the 1880s after the Intercolonial Railway built its line from the Strait of Canso to Sydney, crossing the Barra Strait between Iona and Grand Narrows with the Grand Narrows Bridge, still in use, which is the longest railway bridge in Nova Scotia. Grand Narrows became a major transshipment point between rail and waterborne passengers and cargo. A hotel was constructed and became a popular resting spot, Canada's first prime minister Sir John A. Macdonald was among its guests. A passenger and vehicle ferry service was operated by the provincial government across the Barra Strait to Iona until the Barra Strait highway bridge was opened in October 1993. There is but one route of travel through Grand Narrows; a gravel road called \\"Derby Point\\" which runs along the shoreline for approximately 3 kilometers. Most of the residences in the tiny community are summer homes for families who are based in industrial Cape Breton.

He was considered to be one of the finest poetic talents in the fin de si√®cle Kingdom of Bulgaria. Yavorov was a prominent member of the \\"Misal\\" (\\"–ú–∏—Å—ä–ª\\") literary and cultural group. His life and work are closely connected with the liberation movement Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization in Macedonia. He was also a supporter of the Armenian Independence Movement, and wrote a number of poems about Armenians. Most of his poems are romantic in subject, and dedicated to the two women in his life ‚Äì Mina Todorova and Lora Karavelova. His first (and arguably greatest) love Mina died from tuberculosis, which greatly saddened Yavorov. She was buried in the cemetery of Boulogne Billancourt. Later on he met Lora, the daughter of statesman Petko Karavelov. They were married, and the letters correspondence between them was considered evidence of their ardent and vivid love, and thus different from the relationship Yavorov had with Mina Todorova. In 1913, Lora shot herself and Yavorov tried to commit suicide. The bullet went through his temporal bone, which left him blind. In despair over the trial provoked by Lora's death and the rumor that he had killed her, Yavorov poisoned and then shot himself in autumn 1914, at the age of 36.

It is also thought to mean \\"Shining Waters\\" or \\"Sparkling Waters\\". During the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century Mabou's primary economic activity was underground coal mining with several collieries located in the surrounding area. The Inverness and Richmond Railway opened in 1901 to connect the mines in Mabou and Inverness to wharves in Mabou and Port Hastings. Mining activity ceased following World War II and the railway was abandoned during the late 1980s. Today Mabou is primarily a fishing port for a small fleet of lobster boats. It also hosts a high school serving central Inverness County. It is also a very strong community with many farms.

Life He was born at an uncertain date, the eldest son of John Chauncey. It may be that he studied at Oxford, and afterwards went to Gray's Inn for a course of law, but his meanderings led him to enter the London Charterhouse which years earlier had attracted another law student, Thomas More. In 1535 the majority of the Carthusians refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, but Chauncy, on his own confession, agreed to it. In consequence of their refusal, on 4 May 1535, along with the Bridgettine monk Richard Reynolds, the three Carthusian Priors of London, Beauvale and Axholme, John Houghton, Robert Lawrence and Augustine Webster went to their deaths, and during the next five years fifteen of the London Carthusians perished on the scaffold or were starved to death in Newgate gaol. After the \\"surrender\\" of the monastery in 1537, Chauncy with a few others still at liberty joined the Carthusians of Sheen who had settled in Bruges. With the accession of Queen Mary hopes for a Catholic restoration revived and some nineteen monks belonging to various houses gathered at Sheen, Chauncy being elected prior there in 1556. With the dramatic reversal of 1558, they retired again to Bruges, living with their Flemish brethren until 1569, when they obtained a house on their own in St Clare Street, Chauncy still being the prior. When the hostility of the Calvinists compelled the community to leave Bruges in 1578 they attempted to settle at Douai. After this attempt failed, they retired to Louvain in May 1578. Chauncy died at the old house in Bruges on 2 July 1581. The English community kept together with varying fortunes, until the charterhouse of Sheen Anglorum at Nieuwpoort in Flanders, at that time with a community of six choir monks and two donn√©s, was suppressed by Joseph II in 1783. Works Chauncy was haunted by his weakness in taking the oath of supremacy and wrote a number of works telling the story of his brethren, in which he mentions his lapse: Historia aliquot nostri saeculi Martyrum in Anglia, etc. (Mainz, 1550, and Bruges, 1583); Commentariolus de vitae ratione et martyrio octodecim Cartusianorum qui in Anglia sub rege trucidati sunt (Ghent, 1608), a portion of which was reprinted; Vitae Martyrum Cartusianorum aliquot, qui Londini pro Unitate Ecclesiae adversus haereticos, etc. (Milan, 1606); see Historia aliquot martyrum Anglorum maxime octodecim Cartusianorum: sub Rege Henrico Octavo ob fidei confessionem et summi pontificis jura vindicanda interemptorum a V.

Towards the end of the Second Anglo-Burmese War, Kanaung and Mindon overthrew their half brother Pagan (1848‚Äì1853); Mindon ascended the throne and Kanaung became the Heir Apparent on 11 July 1853. He was the fiery \\"War Prince\\" and the peoples' idol. Kanaung attempted to modernize the country by sending scholars to Western countries and by founding an arms industry. However, his efforts were cut short when he was killed by his two nephews. Notwithstanding his short life, he is revered by Burmese nationals for his innovations in modernizing Burma. Role as a modernizer King Mindon was dedicated to religion, but Kanaung was skillful in administration, serving as the leader (, thamada) of the Hluttaw, the kingdom's administrative body. Under Kanaung's guidance, the following reforms were undertaken: centralization of the kingdom's internal administration, introduction of a salary system for the bureaucracy (to dampen the authority and income of bureaucrats), fixed judicial fees, comprehensive penal laws, reorganization of the financial system, removal of trade barriers including custom duties, reform of the thathameda taxes (to increase direct taxation), and modernization of the kingdom's army and introduction of new police forces. Kanaung tried to rebuild the Burmese Army with modern weapons. He sent men to study in Western countries to establish an up-to-date arms industry. His efforts were well depicted in contemporary stories and poems. One story relates to his effort in testing depth charges in order to repulse British troops sailing up the Irrawaddy. Eventually, these testings were thwarted by the head of the Buddhist Sangha who protested against them by asserting their harmful effects on aquatic lives. Another story tells about his visits to the factories on cold early winter mornings while wrapping in a blanket. He was also known for his waywardness as depicted in a famous love song called Seinchu Kya-nyaung bawl√® written by his wife, Princess Hlaing Hteik Khaung Tin. statute in Mandalay Palace Assassination In an unsuccessful palace coup on 2 August 1866 by the princes Myingun and Myinkhondaing (sons of King Mindon), Kanaung was killed at the Hluttaw (People's Assembly), along with 3 of his sons. Nevertheless, he managed to hold off the assassins to gain enough time for the King's escape. Kanaung's eldest son, the Padein Prince fled to Shwebo and launched a rebellion against Mindon. Royal forces defeated the revolt, and Padein was captured 6 October. He was executed in 1867 for his part in another alleged plot. Upon his death, he was conferred the royal title Thiri Pawara Maha Dhamma Yaza, nominally reserved for kings, as part of a yadaya ritual to \\"substitute\\" for Mindon's death. From almost a year (4 August 1866 to 6 June 1867), Kanaung's corpse was displayed in the middle of a temporary ceremonial palace (during the time, Mindon had relocated to a temporary palace as a form of yadaya, owing to a prophecy that claimed a king would be lost in BE 1228. Kanaung, by assassination, had 'fulfilled' this prophecy and was thus entitled proper rites reserved for a monarch.) His body was buried in the grounds of the Sandamuni Pagoda, built in his memory at the foot of Mandalay Hill by Mindon. In 1878, King Mindon died and his son Prince Thibaw acceded to the throne. In November 1885, King Thibaw surrendered to the British after the defeat at Third Anglo-Burmese War. Consequently, Thibaw was sent to exile in India. To this day, Burmese citizens believe that their history would have been considerably different if Kanaung were to survive and accede to the Burmese throne. The loss of Kanaung Mintha has been mourned by the Burmese nearly as much as that of Aung San. In addition, Burmese people believe British officers were behind the assassination plot of Aung San and Kanaung. Epilogue In 1978 Ne Win, ruler of Burma since leading a military coup in 1964, married June Rose Bellamy, aka Yadana Nat-Me (Precious Angel), a great granddaughter of Ka Naung, daughter of Princess Hteiktin Ma Lat and Herbert Bellamy, an Australian orchid collector long settled in Burma. The marriage lasted only a few months and ended in divorce.

It caters for children for whom mainstream schooling has become insufficient, for varying reasons. The school's motto is \\"Rebuilding Lives Through Education.\\" The school, founded in its current form as a charitable trust on 14 September 1998 as the Beth Marie Centre, is based in of parkland on lease from Mohamed Al- Fayed, who contributed almost ¬£3 million towards the school. The building formerly housed West Heath Girls' School, a girls' school with around 100 boarding pupils, established in 1865 and closed in 1997. History and grounds In the 1990s West Heath Girls' School had financial difficulties due to falling numbers of pupils, and was placed into receivership in 1997. The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund considered buying the school, but decided against it, and Mohamed Al Fayed stepped in to buy West Heath for ¬£2,300,000 on 20 May 1998 as new premises for the Beth Marie Centre. He later pledged to contribute a further ¬£550,000 towards equipping the school. In a statement, he said: :I am surprised that the Princess Diana Memorial Fund, with all its millions in the bank, did not show a greater interest in this project. I believe it to be a far more fitting tribute to her work than putting her name on tasteless souvenirs. The school was founded in its current form, as The New School at West Heath, with Valerie May as Principal, on 14 September 1998. At the start it had around 30 pupils. Boarding began in the year 2000, and there are six boarding houses, each named after one of the trustees (see \\"Management\\", below); Tarrant, Sissons, Astor, Ruth, Hunniford and Esther. An additional, more modern, teaching block was built to increase the classroom capacity and overall space for the school. The entertainer and singer Madonna, who visited the school in 2010, has funded the educational progression through it of one pupil (who has been kept anonymous). The school was renamed as West Heath School in September 2015.

It has been cited as the first product of the Nouvelle Vague, or French New Wave, film movement. The film is often compared with Chabrol's subsequent film Les Cousins, which also features Jean-Claude Brialy and G√©rard Blain. Plot Fran√ßois, a successful yet sickly young man, returns to his home town Sardent after a long absence. He finds that his friend Serge has become a wretched alcoholic, dissatisfied with his life in the village. Serge had hoped to leave the village to study, but had to stay to marry Yvonne when she became pregnant. The death of their stillborn child did not help. Serge has become an angry, bitter figure not unlike the roles of James Dean, refusing to face reality and adulthood. Yvonne is again pregnant. Fran√ßois finds himself at odds with provincial village life yet compelled to help Serge. The fact that they are both entangled sexually with Yvonne's sister, Marie, makes things more complicated. Finally, the birth of Serge and Yvonne's second child seems to provide some possibility of happiness.

He chose instead to shoot in Sardent, a village where his mother lived before moving to Paris and where he often spent the summer with his grandmother. The film was shot over nine weeks in the winter of 1957-8 on a budget of 32 million old francs. It was financed from his first wife's inheritance. The film initially ran to 2 hours and 35 minutes, though Chabrol cut a great deal of quasi-documentary material to reduce the running time, a decision he later regretted.
