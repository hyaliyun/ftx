Playing at inside forward, McNeill started his career at Aberdeen, making his first team debut in January 1951. McNeill moved to England in 1956, and went on to play for Leicester City, Brighton & Hove Albion and Southend United. He returned to Scotland to join Ross County, then a Highland League club, initially as a player before taking over as manager the following season. He led the club to their first ever Highland League Championship in 1967. He then became manager of Wigan Athletic, then a Northern Premier League club, in 1968. McNeill then managed Salisbury in the Southern League, before returning for a second spell at Ross County in 1971. In 1976 he rejoined Wigan Athletic, and led the club into the Football League in 1978. In 1981 he became assistant manager to John Neal at Chelsea. When Neal was sidelined with ill-health during the 1984‚Äì85 season, McNeill also took temporary charge of first team affairs. He returned to management in 1987, this time with Shrewsbury Town and remained until 1990. After this he became assistant manager to Bruce Rioch at Millwall, and later worked as a scout for Bolton Wanderers, Leeds United, Norwich City, Wigan Athletic and Chelsea. He retired from the sport in 2006 and returned to Scotland. Playing career McNeill was born on 24 February 1932, and grew up in the Baillieston area of Glasgow. He was scouted by Aberdeen whilst playing for Junior side Bridgeton Waverley and the Scotland under-18 youth team, and joined the club as a part-time player in 1949 while continuing his apprenticeship as a draughtsman. He made his first team debut in January 1951 against St Mirren, scoring his first goal for the club within ten minutes in a 1‚Äì1 draw. His playing career at Aberdeen was interrupted by National Service, which he spent in Kenya for 18 months before returning to the club in 1955. He struggled to break into the first team, and in 1956 he moved to England to join Leicester City. He scored 18 goals in his first full season at Leicester, helping the club win promotion to the First Division. In 1957‚Äì58, McNeill scored the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win in the final game of the season against Birmingham City, ensuring the club avoided relegation. He made 72 appearances for the club before joining Brighton & Hove Albion in March 1959. He went on to play for Southend United before finishing his playing career in Scotland with Highland League side Ross County. Coaching career McNeill was appointed as manager at Ross County while still playing for the club, and managed the team when they won the Highland League for the first time in 1967. He then had a couple of spells with English non-league clubs, first with Northern Premier League side Wigan Athletic, followed by Salisbury in the Southern League. He returned to Ross County before re-joining Wigan Athletic in 1976. In 1978, he took Wigan to the Football League for the first time after the club were elected to replace Southport. The club went on to finish in the top six for the first two seasons in the Fourth Division. In 1981, he joined Chelsea as assistant manager to former Southend United teammate John Neal.

It was composed by Frith in 1993 as \\"a suite of 23 pieces for saxophone quartet\\", and was performed by the Rova Saxophone Quartet between February 1999 and January 2000 in San Francisco. The album was released on Tzadik Records' Composer Series in 2002. Frith does not perform on this album. The Freedom in Fragments suite was also recorded in January 2008 by the ARTE Quartett, and released by Intakt Records (Switzerland) in January 2009 on a CD entitled The Big Picture by Fred Frith and ARTE Quartett. One of the tracks from the suite, \\"Freedom Is Your Friends II\\" was performed by the Fred Frith Guitar Quartet on their 1997 album Ayaya Moses. Background Freedom in Fragments was commissioned by the San Francisco-based Rova Saxophone Quartet and was composed by Frith specifically for them while he was living at Big Sur, California. He wrote it as a suite of 23 short pieces, or \\"stories\\", that can be played as a whole, or in part, and in any given sequence. Frith wanted a composition \\"which could reach their narrative potential by a force of accumulation ... small stories that, when heard together, become big stories.\\" Frith, Fred. Freedom in Fragments (Tzadik Records, 2002). CD booklet. Frith also composed the suite in a way that the music could be improvised: \\"The determining factor was the understanding that Rova wanted material which they could transform through improvisation. Most of the stories, therefore, involve some question about what might constitute musical freedom.\\" One reviewer of the album stated that \\"[t]he suite's greatest strength is the way it lets Rova crawl around their instruments, from the melodic ballads to noisy skronk.\\" The \\"story\\" sequence performed here by Rova was created by Frith, although it is just one configuration of the work, and only 16 of the 23 pieces appear on the album. The entire work was dedicated to the memory of Charles Mingus, with certain pieces inspired by Frank Zappa, Jimmy Giuffre and Ikue Mori.

In modern British wiring setups, light fittings usually use loop-in ceiling roses, which also include the functionality of a junction box. Etymology The rose has symbolised secrecy since Roman times, due to a confused association with the Egyptian god Horus. For its associations with ceilings and confidentiality, refer to the Scottish Government's Sub Rosa initiative. Through its promise of secrecy, the rose, suspended above a meeting table, symbolises the freedom to speak plainly without repercussion. The physical carving of a rose on a ceiling was used for this purpose during the rule of England's Tudor King Henry VIII and has over the centuries evolved into a standard item of domestic vernacular architecture, to such an extent that it now constitutes a term for the aforementioned circular device that conceals and comprises the wiring box for an overhead light fitting.

It was first issued in 1858 by John Crockford, a London printer and publisher whose father ‚Äì also named John ‚Äì had been a Somerset schoolmaster. Crockford is currently compiled and published for the Archbishops' Council by Church House Publishing. It covers in detail the whole of the Church of England (including the Diocese in Europe), the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the Church of Ireland, and it also gives some information ‚Äì now more limited ‚Äì about the world-wide Anglican Communion.  Previous publishers  Crockford's Clerical Directory 1868, published by Horace Cox, London The actual title of the first edition was simply The Clerical Directory, but a footnote showed that it was published by John Crockford, 29 Essex Street, the Strand. The original publisher died suddenly in 1865, shortly before the appearance of the third edition of what had by then become Crockford‚Äôs Clerical Directory. For many subsequent issues the volumes were anonymously edited, but they were published under the imprint of Horace Cox ‚Äì the nephew of John Crockford‚Äôs closest business associate, solicitor and publisher Edward William Cox (1809Œ©‚Äì1879). (His family was probably quite unrelated to the Charles Cox who coincidentally was the publisher of Crockfords chief rival, the Clergy List.) Horace Cox died in 1918 and the title was subsequently sold in 1921 to the Oxford University Press, who continued as publishers right up until the early 1980s. For the 1985/86 issue publication was transferred to the Church Commissioners and their Central Board of Finance (who worked from their own administrative lists and databases). It is now collated by Church House Publishing.  Frequency of publication  The first four issues came out in 1858, 1860 (with a supplement in 1861), 1865 and 1868. Crockford then reappeared biennially until 1876, when it began a long run of annual appearances which lasted until 1917. The next issue was a delayed 1918/19 edition, which had for the first time incorporated its main rival publication, the Clergy List. Further issues appeared for 1920 and 1921/22; then between 1923 and 1927 and 1929‚Äì1940 the directory reappeared annually, followed by more late issues in 1941 and 1947/48. Since that time Crockford has generally appeared every two years, although gradually worsening delays meant that the 87th and 88th editions were dated 1977/79 and 1980/82, and the book failed to appear at all during 1983/84. Biennial publication was once again resumed in 1985/86, although the volume issued late in 1997 was designated the 1998/99 edition. The 100th edition ‚Äì eventually published for 2008/09 ‚Äì included within its hardback version a few facsimile pages from the first edition, together with an extended historical note describing some of the earlier volumes. The 1858 edition was later described as seemingly ‚Äúassembled in a very haphazard fashion, with names added ‚Äòas fast as they could be obtained‚Äô, out of alphabetical order and with an unreliable index‚Äù. But nevertheless the 1860 directory ‚Äúhad become a very much more useful work of reference‚Äù. However the original volume was actually a consolidation of what in 1857 had been conceived as a mere series of supplements to an entirely different publication, the Clerical Journal. The editors explained in the preface that they wished it to be understood that it was ‚Äúbut the foundation of a great work which, with the Cordial aid of the clergy, we shall hope to make more and more perfect every year‚Äù.  Scope of the directory  Crockford, 1910: a biographical page in an older edition would typically include many abbreviations, including clergy academic backgrounds, and their dates ordained deacon [d] and priest [p] (the presiding bishop being indicated). Diocesan coats of arms were shown alongside episcopal entries; any publications were listed, and parish incomes and patrons were mentioned. Many overseas clergy would be covered. The 1858 issue was based on postal returns from the clergy in England and Wales, involving an outlay ‚Äì as the preface pointed out ‚Äì of \\"more than Five Hundred Pounds for Postage Stamps alone\\". Simpler lists for the Scottish Episcopal Church and for a number of colonial clergy ‚Äì obtained from alternative sources ‚Äì had been added by the 1865 edition, whilst details of Irish clergy had also been extracted from Alexander Thom's Irish Almanack and Official Directory. From the 1870s onwards the scope was progressively extended to all parts of the Anglican communion with the notable exception of the Episcopal Church (United States). The 1870 edition contained 940 pages, but this had increased to over 2,100 pages by 1892. The earliest editions had also gradually added some details of diocesan office holders and administrators, together with the theological colleges, and the royal chapels. They also acquired much fuller indexes ‚Äì along with outline maps of dioceses, and increasingly complete lists of bishops, dating right back to the earliest years of their sees. They further offered to all clergy an opportunity to list their publications, although these lists eventually had to be cut back as their overall length started to increase dramatically. By the early 1980s severe economies had become necessary and 1985/86 edition had to be restricted to the \\"home\\" churches of England, Scotland and Wales. Retired clergy were temporarily restricted to just a few details of their final appointment, although it became possible to restore the Irish clergy in time for the 1987/88 edition. Later editions saw a further return of the retired clergy, together with details of those overseas clergy who had originally been licensed or trained in the UK, or who occupied senior positions within their respective church hierarchies. Details which had also become obtainable from the Church of England Yearbook or from similar sources were generally excluded. For a time too clergy who made their livings though secular jobs were excluded from the biographies section, with the abbreviation NQ (Non-Qualifying Position) being used to cover such periods when clerics returned to parish work and were again eligible for inclusion. In that many such clergy retained diocesan licences or episcopal \\"Permissions to Officiate\\" during their periods of secular employment, this approach may have caused a degree of difficulty for clerics who needed to prove their clerical status. By 1985/86 the first women deacons were being included (although women priests ordained in Hong Kong were included even in the 1970s) while other more recent innovations ‚Äì from the 1990s onwards ‚Äì have included optional email addresses, together with lists of those clergy who have died since the previous edition. Notes on \\"How to Address the Clergy\\" have been retained. A small number of clergy have been excluded at their own request, or have allowed their biographies to appear minus a contact address. The Church Commissioners soon replaced the traditional black hardback bindings in favour of red and also introduced a separate softback alternative version. Since 2004 there has also been a frequently updated Internet edition of Crockford, which is available by subscription. More recently the directory has also joined in with social networking, operating a Twitter account since 2012. An alternative to the main work, Crockford's Shorter Directory, focused almost entirely on the Church of England and omitting all past biographical details, was issued as a single edition in 1953‚Äì54.  Prefaces  The well-known tradition of having an extensive but anonymous preface offering a general review of events within the Anglican Communion ‚Äì together with some occasionally sharp and controversial commentary ‚Äì evolved gradually during the early part of the 20th century. Previous prefaces had tended to be much briefer and they had often been limited merely to explaining the directory's in-house policies. After the events following the publication of the 1987/88 edition, which had ended with the death by suicide of the Revd Gareth Bennett, this tradition of the anonymous preface was discontinued. An anthology, Crockford Prefaces: The Editor Looks Back, anonymously edited by Richard Henry Malden and covering the previous 25 years, was published by the Oxford University Press in 1947.  Locating previous issues  County libraries each have their own policies, but there are good collections in a number of major academic and ecclesiastical libraries, including Cambridge University Library, Lambeth Palace Library, Canterbury Cathedral Library, York Minster Library, the Guildhall Library and the Society of Genealogists. Besides the 1865 reprint, a small number of early editions have been reissued in CD format by various publishers, including Archive CD Books. Scanned copies of other early editions have also begun to appear on the World Wide Web.  Crockford references in fiction  Crockford is referenced in Dorothy Sayers's 1927 detective novel Unnatural Death (chapter XI) where Lord Peter Wimsey uses \\"this valuable work of reference\\" in trying to trace a clergyman who is important for solving the book's mystery. Another fictional character holding Crockford on his bookshelves was Sherlock Holmes, who during one of his final short stories (\\"The Adventure of the Retired Colourman\\"), consulted his copy before dispatching his colleague Dr Watson, together with another companion, to a distant part of Essex. There they interviewed ‚Äúa big solemn rather pompous clergyman‚Äù who received them angrily in his study. The character Dulcie Mainwaring prefers Crockford's format to Who's Who while reflecting on researching in the Public Record Office in London in Barbara Pym's No Fond Return of Love. In a chapter entitled The Visitor in the Night by Freeman Wills Crofts of the book The Floating Admiral, Inspector Rudge looks up the background of Reverend Mount in a Crockford's.

By 1966, Manheim Auto Auction established itself as the world's volume leader, selling off 45 vehicles per hour or 700 cars/trucks on a given Friday night at the 16-laned auction. Adding closed-circuit television, the dealers and wholesalers watched the auction from the new cafeteria in its expanded building. In 1965, Manheim Auto Auction purchased the National Auto Dealers Exchange in Bordentown, New Jersey, and then in 1967, it purchased the Fredericksburg Auto Exchange in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Thus, the partners made Manheim attractive for a potential buyer. =Manheim joins Cox Enterprises= Cox Enterprises entered the auto auction business in 1968, when it purchased Manheim Auto Auction in Manheim, Pennsylvania. Under Cox, Manheim continued to expand by providing vital services, such as reconditioning, recovery, and auto hauling, to both dealership and wholesalers. By the end of the 20th century, the Manheim Auto Auctions had advanced its sales by adding information technology (online sales). Today, Cox Enterprises owns 98% of Auto Trader, one of the world‚Äôs leading providers of online and print automotive consumer information. =Notable Acquisitions= Manheim acquired Dent Wizard, the paintless dent removal company (also known as \\"PDR\\") in 1998. After turning it into the largest PDR company in the world, Manheim sold Dent Wizard's the United States and Canada markets to H.I.G. Capital, a leading global private equity firm, in November 2010. In 2006, Manheim became interested in Akinvest Inc. This Canadian company started off as a business that speculated on world automobile values in 1991. The owner, Andrei Kouznetsov, developed a new concept that allowed a foreign dealer to have Akinvest perform all of the necessary procedures to have vehicles delivered to the port nearest to that buyer. By 2005 Akinvest, doing business as Exporttrader was completely developed the service aspects of the business that assisted non-North American dealers. The organization became known as the leader in the export of used cars field from North America. All of the major remarketing companies such as Copart, IAA, ADESA, Carfax and Manheim had foreign transactions that were completed by Akinvest/Exporttrader. The strength of the procedures used was enhanced by superior programming and automated Web Sites, retaining enormous banks of data. Export Trader/Akinvest negotiated for new export programs and procedures with the governments of Canada and United States and was consulted numerous times by International law enforcement on global irregularities. Exporttrader was consulted by marketing firms and journals like the Wall Street Journal. to give opinions on global automotive trade and were asked to speak at international conferences. In 2008 Akinvest/Export Trader had 70 employees with offices in Toronto, Moscow and Finlandhttp://www.tks.ru/forum/search.php?searchid=3930086. \\"Akinvest is the parent company of two of the leading players in the export business: Freightmar International and ExportTrader.com. The agreement was signed in January 2009 for a staged buyout of Akinvest/ Export Trader transforming the entire organization under the name WES Exporttrader. The final stage of the transfer to Manheim occurred in late 2014. Subsequently, in April 2015, Manheim has closed the Canadian offices of WES Exporttrader and moved the operation to Atlanta. They now run \\"all new \\"Global Trader\\" out of Atlanta. Near the end of March 2016, Manheim Global Export was sold, but it had too many debts and eventually declared bankruptcy.

He was a pupil of the composer Franz Schreker. When the National Socialists came to power he was obliged to leave Germany and settled in England from 1935, although he was interned in Mooragh Camp on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien from 1939 to 1941. Ralph Vaughan Williams intervened to help get him released. He finally became a naturalized citizen in 1947 and changed his name to Peter. Working with the Vic-Wells Opera during and after the war led to an invitation from David Webster to join the staff of Covent Garden Opera when it re-opened after the war. He became assistant to music director Karl Rankl and conducted there many times from June 1947 onward. During his later career he also conducted at Glyndebourne, and with the Carl Rosa Opera Company. From 1961 he became Director of the BBC Chorus (later BBC Singers), conducting them in works such as Holst's The Cloud Messenger and Rubbra's In Die et Nocte Canticum. In 1967 Gellhorn worked with Peter and Gillian Hunt to set up the annual educational music festival Opera Barga in central Italy, acting as the musical director.Quattrocchi, Arrigo.

The earliest formal presentation of clinical vampirism to appear in the psychiatric literature, with the psychoanalytic interpretation of two cases, was contributed by Richard L. Vanden Bergh and John F. Kelley. As the authors point out, in 2010, over 50,000 people addicted to drinking blood have appeared in the psychiatric literature at least since 1892, documented in the work of Austrian forensic psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. Many medical publications concerning clinical vampirism can be found in the literature of forensic psychiatry, with the unusual behavior reported as one of many aspects of extraordinary violent crimes.  History  The syndrome is named after Dracula's human zoophagous follower, R. M. Renfield, in the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker. According to an interview conducted by psychology professor Katherine Ramsland with clinical psychologist Richard Noll, who coined the eponymous term in a 1992 book,, https://www.academia.edu/6793535/Vampires_Werewolves_and_Demons_Twentieth_Century_Case_Reports_in_the_Psychiatric_Literature_1991_ he invented the term and its purported diagnostic criteria as a whimsical parody of the \\"new DSM-speak\\" of the psychiatry of the 1980s. In a public lecture hosted by Penn State University's Institute for the Arts and Humanities on 7 October 2013, Noll traced the 20-year trajectory of his unintentionally created \\"monster\\" from the moment of its creation as a parody of DSM mental disorders to the cultural popularity of Renfield's syndrome today. After Noll's book appeared in the year 1992 clinical vampirism has usually been referred to as Renfield's syndrome. In an NBC pre-Halloween special hosted by actor Peter Graves entitled \\"The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Vampires\\" that aired on 23 October 1994 (and is available on YouTube, with the 34:11 mark beginning the segment), pages from Noll's book were shown on camera as Canadian psychologist Leonard George summarized Renfield's syndrome for a wide television audience. Characters suffering from Renfield's Syndrome have appeared on television. The first appeared in a 2005 episode of CSI titled \\"Committed\\" (Season 5, Episode 21). It was also mentioned in 2009 in episode 7, season 5 of Criminal Minds entitled \\"The Performer\\". In 2010 an 11-episode Canadian television series, The Renfield Syndrome, was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., but does not seem to have been aired. On 15 August 2012 Renfield's syndrome was the subject of a video segment on The Huffington Post by Cara Santa Maria which again relied heavily on Noll's work and a recent scholarly article on the (pseudo-)syndrome published in the Journal of the History of the Neurosciences. In addition to references to Renfield's syndrome in the psychiatric literature and mass media, the horror writer Chelsea Quinn Yarbro published a story entitled \\"Renfield's Syndrome\\" in July 2002, which was then reprinted in an anthology that appeared the following year. It is also the title of a novel by J.A. Saare. The twenty-year evolution of a farcical 3-page book section that shot through the mass media and then‚Äîuncritically‚Äîinto the pages of a peer-reviewed scholarly journal should serve as a cautionary tale about the purported validity of other \\"mental disorders.\\" Philosopher of science Ian Hacking refers to this process as \\"making up people\\" and critiques medical and psychiatric elites for the untoward effects of their \\"dynamic nominalism\\" on individual lives. Such arbitrary categories create new natural \\"kinds\\" of people (e.g., perverts, multiple personalities and so on) that serve larger political, cultural and moral purposes and change with historical contingencies. According to the case history reports in the older psychiatric literature that formed the basis of Noll's parody, the condition starts with a key event in childhood that causes the experience of blood injury or the ingestion of blood to be exciting. After puberty, the excitement is experienced as sexual arousal. Throughout adolescence and adulthood, blood, its presence, and its consumption can also stimulate a sense of power and control. Noll speculated that Renfield's syndrome begins with autovampirism and then progresses to the consumption of the blood of other creatures. The usefulness of this diagnostic label remains in question. Very few cases of the syndrome have been described, and the published reports that do exist refer to what has been proposed as Renfield's syndrome through the use of official psychiatric diagnostic categories such as schizophrenia or as a variety of paraphilia.  Psychiatric and forensic contexts  Very few cases of the syndrome have been described, and the published reports that do exist describe clinical vampirism as behaviors that are subsumed under more conventional psychiatric diagnostic categories such as schizophrenia or paraphilia. A case of vampirism in Turkey reported in 2012 was discussed as an unusual feature of a patient diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. While not referencing the literature on Renfield's syndrome, two Irish psychiatrists surveyed the psychiatric literature on vampirism as evidence of a changing discourse in psychiatry from the narrative of case studies to the depersonalized discourse of checklist diagnostic criteria. A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. Serial killers Peter K√ºrten and Richard Trenton Chase were both called \\"vampires\\" in the tabloids after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. Similarly, in 1932, an unsolved murder case in Stockholm, Sweden was nicknamed the \\"Vampire murder\\", due to the circumstances of the victim's death. Clinical vampirism in the context of criminal acts of violence, as well as \\"consensual\\" vampirism as a social ritual, have been extensively documented in the many works of Katharine Ramsland. Others have commented upon the psychiatric implications of \\"vampire cults\\" among adolescents.

Biography Patrul Rinpoche was born in Dzachukha, a nomadic area of Golok Dzachukha, Eastern Tibet in 1808, and was recognized as the reincarnation of Palg√© Samten Phuntsok and was given the name Orgyen Jikm√© Ch√∂kyi Wangpo. With Dola Jikm√© Kalzang, Jikm√© Ngotsar, Gyals√© Shenpen Thay√© and other teachers, he studied Longchen Rabjam's Trilogy of Finding Comfort and Ease, The Way of the Bodhisattva (Bodhicaryavatara), Secret Essence (Guhyagarbha) Tantra and many other works related to sutra and tantra, as well as the ordinary sciences. From Shechen √ñntrul Thutob Namgyal, he received the reading transmission for the Translated Word of the Buddha (Kangyur) and teachings on Sanskrit grammar. He received the transmissions for the Kangyur and Tengyur in their entirety, together with the writings of many masters of the old and new translation schools. He received instruction on the Longchen Nyingtik Ngondro some twenty-five times from Jikm√© Gyalw√© Nyugu, and Patrul Rinpoche completed the required practices the same number of times. In addition, he received instruction on tsa-lung practice and Dzogchen, and studied many of the cycles of practice found in the canonical scriptures (kama) of the Nyingma Vajrayana. Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje introduced him to the pure awareness of rigpa while exhibiting wild and eccentric behaviour. He trained for a long time in the Longchen Nyingtik tsa-lung practices, and he received many teachings from Dzogchen Rinpoche Mingyur Namkh√© Dorje and other masters. While remaining for long periods near Dzogchen Monastery in the isolated hermitages of Rudam, such as the Yamantaka Cave and the Long Life cave, he put his energy into the practice of meditation and, it is said, attained a realization that was as vast as space. From the age of thirty, he travelled to Serthar, Yarlung Pemako and other places, teaching extensively on the Secret Essence Tantra. To assemblies in Serthar and in the upper and lower regions of the Do valley he taught on The Way of the Bodhisattva, Mani Kabum, Aspiration Prayer of Sukhavati and so on. He made efforts to put an end to robbery and banditry and abolished the custom of serving meat at special gatherings. He also went to Dzamthang and studied the Six Yogas with Tsangpa Ngawang Ch√∂jor, and he went to Minyak, where he had extensive discussions with Dra Geshe Tsultrim Namgyal on the prajnaparamita and other topics. In Shri Singha college at Dzogchen Monastery and at Pem√© Thang and other places, he turned the wheel of Dharma uninterruptedly, teaching on the treatises of Maitreya, the Middle way, Abhidharma, Secret Essence Tantra, Treasury of Precious Qualities, Ascertainment of the Three Vows and other topics. In particular, when he taught on The Way of the Bodhisattva in the vicinity of Dzogchen Shri Singha for several years in succession, large numbers of flowers called Serchen, with between thirty and fifty petals, blossomed all of a sudden, and they became known as ‚Äòbodhicharyavatara flowers.‚Äô He went to Kathok Dorje Den, where he offered prostrations and 'circumambulated' (Wylie: skor ba) the reliquaries of the three great masters Dampa Deshek, Tsangt√∂n Dorje and Jampa Bum. At the request of Situ Choktrul Ch√∂kyi Lodr√∂ and others, he gave extensive explanations on The Way of the Bodhisattva to the whole assembly of monks. He went to major monasteries of the Riwo Gendenpa tradition such as Sershul, Labtridu, Chuhor and others and taught elaborately on The Way of the Bodhisattva and other topics. Patrul Rinpoche established a teaching centre in the vicinity of Dzagyal Monastery and he repaired the large complex of walls of ‚Äòmani stones' (Wylie: do-bum) built by his previous incarnation Palge Samten Phuntsok, which thereafter became known as the Patrul Dobum. Patrul Rinpoche His disciples included masters of the Nyingma school such as Kathok Situ Choktrul Ch√∂kyi Lodr√∂, the Fifth Dzogchen Rinpoche Thubten Ch√∂kyi Dorje, Gyarong Namtrul Kunzang Thekchok Dorje, the second and third Dodrupchens, Jikme Phuntsok Jungne and Jikm√© Tenpe Nyima, Dechen Rigp√© Raldri, who was the son of Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje, Khenpo Shenga, Adzom Druktrul Droddul Dorje, Tert√∂n Sogyal Lerab Lingpa, Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso, Khenpo Pema Vajra, Nyoshul Lungtok, Alak Dongak Gyatso and others. In addition, his disciples included many masters of the Sakya, Gelugpa and Kagy√º schools, such as Sershul Lharampa Thubten, Palpung Lama Tashi √ñzer and Ju Lama Drakpa Gyaltsen. Patrul Rinpoche died on the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month in the Fire Pig year of the fifteenth calendrical cycle (1887). Patrul Rinpoche's writings were not collected by the master himself or by his attendants, and thus many of them were never carved into printing blocks. Those which were printed and which are now to be found comprise six volumes. These include works of various styles and genres, including commentaries on and structural outlines (sa bcad) for the treatises of Maitreya, The Way of the Bodhisattva, Treasury of Precious Qualities and other texts, such as The Words of My Perfect Teacher, and miscellaneous writings including The Drama in the Lotus Garden, which was written to console a young nobleman from Derge called Trashi Deleg whose young bride had been killed in an epidemic.

Marie language resolution was a government motion passed on January 29, 1990 by Sault Ste. Marie City Council, the governing body of the city of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, which resolved that English was the sole working language of city government. The resolution ignited a national controversy which made the city a flashpoint in the Meech Lake Accord debate. The Sault Ste. Marie resolution was not the first of its kind in Ontario, but Sault Ste. Marie was the largest municipality to pass such a resolution and bore the brunt of the controversy. The resolution was struck down by a court ruling in 1994, and ceased to have legal effect. In 2010, John Rowswell, a subsequent mayor of Sault Ste. Marie, apologized to French Canadians across the country for the resolution.\\"Les excuses de Sault-Sainte-Marie\\". Radio- Canada, January 28, 2010.  Background  Sault Ste. Marie was founded by French-speaking missionaries in 1623 but had become overwhelmingly English- speaking by the twentieth century. In response to a French-language education controversy which began in 1987 when a group of Franco-Ontarian families lobbied to have a new French school opened in the city, the Sault Alliance for the Preservation of English Language Rights (SAPELR) was formed and began circulating petitions to have this resolution passed by council. The group worked in concert with the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada (APEC), a lobby group which was concurrently campaigning against the provincial government's French Language Services Act. Although that law dealt only with provincial government services, APEC's strategy was to convince municipalities that they would be required to provide services in French, regardless of cost or benefit, in an attempt to convince the municipalities to pass this type of resolution. As a result of the schooling controversy, the SAPELR petition quickly garnered over 25,000 signatures. The resolution was widely seen as retaliation for Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa's move to override the Supreme Court of Canada ruling that declared parts of Bill 101 unconstitutional. Bill 101 had declared French as the only official language of Quebec. Text of the resolution > Whereas the City of Sault Ste.

This triggered the attention of the national media, and with reporters from all across Canada in town to cover the debate, the resolution passed council 11-2. Controversy Many political figures, including Brian Mulroney, Jean Chr√©tien and Ontario premier David Peterson, who had strongly condemned Premier Bourassa's use of the notwithstanding clause, expressed their opposition to the city's move. Both Peterson and his successor as premier, Bob Rae, refused to meet with mayor Joe Fratesi on several subsequent occasions, even to discuss unrelated matters. In particular, the resolution was seen as a slap in the face to Quebec, where it was widely viewed as racist. (One Environment Canada meteorologist sent out a weather report for Sault Ste. Marie in which the forecast called for \\"a chance of flurries and Nazis\\", leading to her suspension.) Council defended the resolution, suggesting that Quebec's language laws and its refusal to abide by the Supreme Court ruling also constituted racism. Council was also criticized for seemingly turning its back on the city's own history; although in modern times francophones are only a small percentage of the city's population, the city's history is intimately connected to early French Canadian missionary and voyageur exploration of the Great Lakes area. Some commentators also jokingly suggested that the resolution would require the city to change its name to St. Mary's Falls. Entertainers weighed in on the controversy; on their 1991 album Road Apples, The Tragically Hip criticized the resolution in the song \\"Born in the Water\\": > Smart as trees in Sault Ste. Marie > I can speak my mother tongue > Passing laws, just because > And singing songs of the English unsung > How could you do it? > How could you even try? > When you were born in the water > And you were raised up in the sky? Aftereffects Fratesi, who was viewed by Sault Ste. Marie voters throughout the controversy as standing up for the city's interests, was re-elected mayor in a landslide in 1991. He later became embroiled in a conflict of interest controversy in 1995 when he applied for the job of chief administrative officer of the city, while still sitting as mayor. Quebec Premier Bourassa later passed Bill 86, which amended that province's language laws in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling, so the controversy died down. On June 30, 1994, a court ruling struck down the English-only resolution as ultra vires the council's authority. On August 9, 1999, a resolution was brought forward under a new city council to strike down the resolution. The city's solicitor advised that the resolution was out of order given that a court had already struck down the resolution. Attempting to do what it could, the council then unanimously passed the following resolution: > Moved by Councillor Derik Brandt > Seconded by Councillor Sam Lepore > Whereas the \\"language resolution\\" was struck down by the courts because it > was beyond the City‚Äôs authority; and > Whereas it is not legally possible to rescind a resolution that has already > been struck down by the courts; > Be It Resolved that a notation be added to the Minutes of the Regular > Meeting of City Council of January 29, 1990 to include the following beside > item 5(e); N.B. \\"This resolution was struck down by the courts on June 30, > 1994 and therefore has no effect.\\" The effect of the resolution was to amend the minutes containing the English- only resolution to note that the resolution had been struck down. As recently as 2007, The Gazette in Montreal referred to the town of H√©rouxville, then embroiled in a controversy around reasonable accommodation of immigrants, as Quebec's \\"own Sault Ste. Marie\\".Don Macpherson, \\"The town of Herouxville is our own Sault Ste. Marie\\", The Gazette, January 30, 2007. On January 28, 2010, 20 years less a day after the original resolution was passed, then-Sault Ste. Marie Mayor John Rowswell apologized to French-Canadians across the country for the resolution of the prior council. References Municipal government of Sault Ste.

As a two-year-old he won three of his six races, most notably the Dewhurst Stakes as a 50/1 outsider. He finished fourth in the 2000 Guineas on his three-year-old debut, but showed vastly improved form when moved up to longer distances in summer. In a period of seven weeks he won the Derby by five lengths, the Irish Derby by three lengths and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes by a record seven lengths. His performances established him as one of the outstanding British racehorses of his era. After running poorly in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe he was retired to stud, where his record was disappointing. Background Generous was a flaxen chestnut horse with a white star and snip bred by the Barronstown Stud in County Wicklow, Ireland. He was foaled on 8 February 1988. Generous was sired by Caerleon, an American-bred colt who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup in 1983 when trained in Ireland by Vincent O'Brien. Caerleon sired many other good winners including Marienbard, Lady Carla, Cape Verdi and Warrsan. The success of Generous enabled Caerleon to claim his only British sires' championship in 1991. Generous' dam, Doff The Derby a daughter of the Preakness Stakes winner Master Derby who was a son of the 1970 Kentucky Derby winner, Dust Commander. Doff the Derby later produced The Oaks winner Imagine. As a daughter of Margarethen, Doff The Derby was closely related to the outstanding racemares Trillion and Triptych. Generous was sold as a foal to the bloodstock agent Hamish Alexander for 80,000 Irish guineas. In the following year he was sent to the Goff's sale where he was bought for 200,000 Irish guineas by Fahd Salman. Then he was trained by Paul Cole at his stable at Whatcombe in Oxfordshire. Generous was ridden in six of his first seven races by Richard Quinn. In his last four races he was ridden by Alan Munro. Racing career =1990: two-year-old season= Generous made his racecourse debut on 2 May at Ascot Racecourse when he contested a Graduation race (restricted to horses who had won no more than once) over five furlongs. Starting at odds of 6/1 against five opponents, he took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by half a length from Les Animaux Nuages with the future Diomed Stakes winner Sylva Honda in fourth. In June, Generous was moved up in class to contest the Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Willie Carson he finished second to Mac's Imp. In August he was sent to Goodwood Racecourse for the Vintage Stakes in which he finished third behind Mukaddamah. Seventeen days later he was sent to Deauville Racecourse in France and made no impression in the Prix Morny, finishing tenth behind Hector Protector. Generous was dropped in class on his return to England, where he was an easy winner of a minor stakes race at Sandown Park Racecourse on 18 September. Generous' final appearance of the season was in Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 19 October. He was given little chance and was sent off at odds of 50/1 in a field of eight runners. Quinn restrained the colt in the early stages before producing a strong late run to overtake Bog Trotter inside the final furlong and record an upset victory by three-quartes of a length. =1991: three-year-old season= On his first appearance of 1991, Generous, whose preparation had been delayed by a hoof injury, contested the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile on 4 May. He started at odds of 11/1 and finished fourth of the fourteen runners behind Mystiko, Lycius and Ganges. After the Guineas, Paul Cole's stable jockey was replaced as Generous's rider by Alan Munro, reportedly at the insistence of the colt's owner. On 5 June 1991 Generous, ridden for the first time by Munro, started the 9/1 fifth favourite in a field of thirteen for the 211th running of the Derby. Toulon and Corrupt started joint-favourites ahead of Mystiko and Hector Protector. Generous was settled in third place behind Mystiko before moving up to take the lead early in the straight. He quickly went clear of the field and won by five lengths from Marju, who finished seven lengths clear of Star of Gdansk and Hector Protector. On 30 June Generous was sent to contest the Irish Derby at the Curragh in which he was matched against the leading French-trained colt Suave Dancer, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club. Generous took the lead half a mile from the finish and held off the challenge of Suave Dancer in the straight to win by three lengths. A month later, Generous was tested against older horses for the first time in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. Starting the 4/6 favourite he took the lead early in the straight and pulled clear of the field to win by seven lengths from Sanglamore. The winning margin was the widest ever recorded in the race, surpassing Mill Reef's six length win in 1971. On 6 October Generous started odds-on favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse. He pulled hard in the early stages and faded in the straight, finishing eighth of the fourteen runners behind Suave Dancer. Assessment Generous was given a rating of 139 by the independent Timeform organisation, making him the highest-rated racehorse of the year. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Generous a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù Derby winner, the sixteenth best British or Irish racehorse of the 20th century and the best racehorse in the world in 1991. Stud career Generous was retired after the 1991 racing season to stud duty at Salman's Banstead Manor stud in England where he remained until 1995. He was sent to a breeder in Japan in 1996 where he sired 147 runners then to New Zealand in 1999. In 2002, he returned to Europe where he spent time at the Scarvagh Stud in Northern Ireland and the Sandley Stud in Dorset. Generous was not a particularly successful breeding stallion. The best of his progeny was probably Catella, a German-bred filly who won the Group One Grosser Erdgas- Preis in 2000. His other good winners included Bahr (Ribblesdale Stakes), Copeland (Scottish Champion Hurdle) and Blueprint (Jockey Club Stakes). Generous died in January 2013 at the age of twenty-five. Alfie Buller, the owner of the Scarvagh Stud, described him as \\"unbelievably intelligent for a horse, kind and truly regal... he will be sadly missed.\\" Pedigree References External links * Generous' profile at Barronstown Stud * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Generous 1988 racehorse births 2013 racehorse deaths Racehorses bred in Ireland Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Irish Classic Race winners Thoroughbred family 4-n Epsom Derby winners King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winners ","title":"Generous (horse)"},{"id":"9731283","text":"Sound-in-Syncs is a method of multiplexing sound and video signals into a channel designed to carry video, in which data representing the sound is inserted into the line synchronising pulse of an analogue television waveform. This is used on point-to-point links within broadcasting networks, including studio/transmitter links (STL). It is not used for broadcasts to the public. History The technique was first developed by the BBC in the late 1960s. In 1966, The corporation's Research Department made a feasibility study of the use of pulse-code modulation (PCM) for transmitting television sound during the synchronising period of the video signal. This had several advantages: it removed the necessity for a separate sound link and offered improved sound quality and reliability.Pawley, E (1972). BBC Engineering 1922-1972, pp. 506-7, 522.

Two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse. At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting. Following successful trials with the BBC, in 1971 Pye TVT started to make and sell the S-i-S equipment under licence. The largest quantities went to the BBC itself, to the EBU and to Canada. Smaller numbers went to other countries including South Africa, Australia and Japan.Holder, J.E., Spenceley, N.M. and Clementson, C.S.

Sound-in-Syncs System for Outside Broadcasts, BBC Engineering, No. 86, April 1971, pp 18-28. =Stereo S-i-S= Later systems, developed in the 1980s, used 14-bit linear PCM samples, digitally companded into 10-bit samples by means of NICAM-3 lossy compression. These were capable of carrying two audio channels and were known as stereo Sound-in-Syncs. =ITV S-i-S= The ITV network used coders and encoders produced by RE of Denmark.

Additional ingredients, such as pepperoni, banana pepper, lettuce and mustard, may be added to the Maine Italian sandwich. Outside of Maine, Italian sandwiches are typically prepared on a hard or soft Italian roll with the following ingredients: all thinly sliced to order meats including danish ham, genoa salami and capicolla along with provolone, shredded lettuce, onion, oil and vinegar, cracked black pepper and dried oregano. Additional ingredients, such as banana pepper and/or hot peppers may be added to the sandwich. The sandwich is often cut in half to make it easier to handle. The flavors and texture of the sandwich are unified by the ingredients used to create a gastronomic equilibrium, with the fats and acids in the ingredients serving to counterbalance one another. History The Italian sandwich was invented in Portland, Maine, by baker Giovanni Amato in 1903. While selling his bread on his street cart, Amato received requests from dockworkers to slice his long bread rolls and add sliced meat, cheese and vegetables to them. Amato later opened a sandwich shop named Amato's, and today the sandwich continues to be prepared by Amato's sandwich shops in Portland.

Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Dehn wrote a biography, The Real Tsaritsa, to refute rumors that were circulating in Europe during the 1920s about the Empress and Grigori Rasputin. Early life Dehn was born Yulia Alexandrovna Smolskaia on her family's southern Russian estate, Revovka, a home of her ancestor General Mikhail Kutuzov, the victor of Napoleon during the 1812 invasion of Russia. Her parents were Ismail Selim Bek Smolsky and Catherine Horvat. Both sides of her family had a long history in Russia, according to her memoirs. Her parents divorced when she was eleven and her mother later remarried. Her maternal grandmother helped to raise her. She was educated by tutors at home and wrote that she understood very little Russian as a child because her family spoke French. As a young girl, she enjoyed listening to folk stories of old Russia told by her maternal grandmother and her childhood nurse. \\"The peasants at Revovka were extremely superstitious, and they believed implicitly in witches and warlocks,\\" wrote Dehn. Later, she had an English governess. She loved her childhood estate and, whenever she went to visit an uncle in Livadiya, took a bit of dirt with her from Revovka to remind her of home. Marriage and friendship with the Empress Dehn married 1907 in Yalta, Carl Alexander Akimovich (or \\"Joachimovitch\\") von Dehn (1877‚Äì1932), a Russian naval officer whose family originally came from Tallinn, Estonia, from Finland and from Sweden. Dehn was an officer on the imperial yacht, Standart, and was a favorite with the imperial children. The Empress took an interest in Dehn's new wife and befriended her following the marriage. The Empress was the godmother for the Dehns' son, Alexander Leonide, who was born on August 9, 1908, and nicknamed \\"Titi\\". Dehn wrote that Titi was baptized Lutheran, which was required by her husband's family to maintain an inheritance. Alexandra remained disturbed that her godchild had had a Lutheran baptism and insisted seven years later that the child must be rebaptized in the Russian Orthodox Church. The Dehns complied with her request. Dehn was skeptical about the holiness of the starets in making Grigori Rasputin and the Empress's reliance upon him, but wrote that Rasputin once prayed over her own son, Titi, when the child was dangerously ill and the boy made a quick recovery. World War I and Revolution Dehn trained to become a Red Cross nurse during World War I and nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital. She was with the imperial family during the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and helped nurse the imperial children and the Empress's friend, Anna Vyrubova, who was also Dehn's distant cousin, through an outbreak of measles. She witnessed the Emperor's abdication and the family's imprisonment by the new provisional government. Dehn left the palace with Anna Vyrubova to accompany her to the capital, following Vyrubova's arrest, and upon arriving in the capital, she was herself arrested.Sophie Buxhoeveden, The life and tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna, empress of Russia, a biography by Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden; with an introduction by J. C. Squire, 1928 She was not allowed to return to the Alexander Palace, and persuaded the government to place her under house arrest in her own home because her son Titi was dangerously ill. Dehn wrote in her book that she blamed the Revolution on Jewish revolutionaries. Exile Dehn escaped Russia aboard the ship SS Kherson with her mother and son Titi via Turkey and Greece. They eventually reached England. The family first settled in England, where the von Dehns had two more children, Ekaterina, or Katharina, or Catherine (Kitty), in December 1919 and Maria Olga, or Marie, in April 1923. They later moved to a family estate, Holowiesk, in eastern Poland. Her husband died in 1932. After World War II broke out, she was forced to emigrate again and ended in Caracas, Venezuela, with her son Alexander (Titi) and her daughter Maria. In 1958 she moved with Maria and her husband Kurt Happe to the US and then to Rome where she died in 1963 . In the early 1950s, Dehn visited Anna Anderson, who claimed to be the rescued Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. Dehn has been quoted as saying that she recognized Anderson as Anastasia. \\"What can I say after having known her?\\" Dehn said after the meeting. \\"I certainly cannot be mistaken about her identity.\\".Kurth, Peter, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson, Back Bay Books, 1983, p. 289 Her son, Alexander, died in 1974 in Caracas, Venezuela.

As with other forms of musical notation, sounds are represented by symbols which are usually written onto a musical staff (or stave). Percussion instruments are generally grouped into two categories: pitched and non-pitched. The notation of non-pitched percussion instruments is less standardized and often includes a key or legend. Cymbals are usually notated with 'x' note heads, drums with normal elliptical note heads and auxiliary percussion with alternative note heads.Drum Notation - Drumbook.org Non-pitched percussion notation on a conventional staff once commonly employed the bass clef, but the neutral clef (or \\"percussion clef\\"), consisting of two parallel vertical lines, is usually preferred now. It is usual to label each instrument and technique the first time it is introduced, or to add an explanatory footnote, to clarify this. Sometimes unconventional staves are used to clarify notation, for example a 2-, 3-, or 4- line stave may be used where each line refers to a differently pitched instrument, such as temple blocks or tom-toms, or a single line stave may be used for a single non-pitched instrument such as a tambourine. Key or legend Each line and space of the staff is assigned a different part or \\"voice\\" of the drum kit and these are often laid out at the beginning of a piece of music in what is known as a key or legend or occasionally labeled when initially appearing in the piece.Peckman, Jonathan (2007). Picture Yourself Drumming, p.46. . Below are two examples of Drum Legends as they would appear in the music: Example 1: (Less common) Drum legend example Example 2: Drum legend.

(With stem this looks rather like a long \\"T\\" or a long inverted \\"T\\", depending which way the stem is going.) Dynamic accents Location:Left In percussion notation, accents are almost always to be interpreted as dynamic accents. Typically this involves emphasizing the accented note simply by raising the dynamic level. The meanings of the different types of accents are not entirely standard. The image above shows the accent notations most commonly used by composers of percussion music. The tenuto articulation is often used to indicate a slight raise in dynamic, less than a normal accent. Marcato markings typically indicate a more dramatic dynamic change. It is important to note that these markings have different meanings in traditional musical notation for other instruments. Anti-accents # slightly softer than surrounding notes: Àò (breve above or below--inverted--notehead) # significantly softer than surrounding notes: ( ) (note head in parentheses) # much softer than surrounding notes: [ ] (note head in brackets) (Ghost note is a less formal alternative term which may refer either to anti-accentuation in general or to a particular degree of anti-accentuation.

In addition to a temple of Hera of unusual construction and antiquity, the remains of a number of other structures have also been found, including an L-shaped stoa, a large cistern, dining rooms, and a second potential temple. The Sanctuary of Hera at Perachora is north-northwest of Corinth and west of Athens. Although there is debate between Argos, Megara and Corinth, the sanctuary was probably under the control of Corinth, as it faced the harbors of that powerful city across the Corinthian gulf. Cult activity at the site continued from perhaps the 9th century BCE to 146 BCE, when the Roman general Mummius sacked Corinth during the war with the Achaean League. In the Roman period, domestic structures were built on the site, indicating that the area was no longer a sanctuary. This site is significant for the study of the origins of Greek temple architecture and rural cults.  Mythology and history  There is a legend recounted in Euripides that Medea buried her murdered children at a sanctuary of Hera Akraia as she fled from Corinth.Euripides, Medea 1378‚Äì1383 This may be a reference to this site. Herodotus tells the story of Periander stripping the clothes off of the Corinthian women at a sanctuary of Hera.5.92 The Greek historian Strabo wrote in the 1st century CE that there was an oracle associated with the sanctuary. If the temple was still in use by the 4th-century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when laws against non- Christian religions and their sanctuaries where enacted by the Christian emperors.

Modern footpath The known structures of the sanctuary cover a rectangle approximately north-south and east-west. The sanctuary wrapped around a small cove and extended toward the east uphill along a ridge. The structures will be discussed in order from west to east. = West court = At the extreme southwest end of the sanctuary, there is a polygonal area of roughly largely cut into the rock beside the cove. This structure has been variously termed the agora, or the west court. This structure may date to the 6th century BCE and thus be contemporary with the Temple of Hera Akraia. It appears to have been destroyed in the 4th century BCE; it has been proposed that the L-shaped stoa took over its function. There appear to have been colonnades on the western and southern sides. There are remains of a house from the Roman period roughly at the center of the area. = Apsidal structure and temple of Hera Akraia= The western end of the 6th century BCE Temple of Hera Akraia showing the three aisles. The earliest structure at the site was an apsidal building of perhaps the late 9th century BCE, which is thought to resemble the house- temple models known from the Argive Heraion. On that analogy, it would have had a high-peaked roof, covered perhaps in thatch. There were Early Helladic sherds under this structure. In the 6th century BCE, a Doric order tetrastyle- prostyle temple of about was built a little to the west of the apsidal structure. The epithet Akraia refers to the position of the sanctuary at the point of the peninsula. The cella of this temple was divided into three aisles ‚Äì a highly unusual design. There was a wall to divide the west end of the cella and a screen in front of the cult statue. Evidence for the reuse of some blocks may indicate that there was a prior phase of the structure in the 7th century BCE. The roof of this temple was of marble. No evidence has yet been found of pedimental sculptures. The lime kiln in the 6th century BCE temple The Doric order triglyph and metope frieze may have only extended along the eastern face, as few of the elements of this survive. The metopes were about thick and slotted into the triglyph blocks rather than forming a single block with them, as is more typical. Roughly in the center of the southern side of the temple was a limekiln of about in diameter that was used to reduce the marble of the temple (and of the sanctuary generally) into lime for the construction of the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth in the 5th century CE. Scorch mark remain visible on the stones of the temple around a circular area where the heat of the limekiln caused the breakdown of the underlying stones. = Triglyph and metope altar = The triglyph and metope altar from the south; beyond the altar is the western end of the L-shaped stoa. About east of the Temple of Hera Akraia, there was a stone altar decorated with a triglyph and metope frieze dating from the early 4th century BCE. This altar measured about . In the late 4th century BCE Ionic columns were added to the corners, perhaps for a canopy. = L-shaped stoa = Overview of the lower sanctuary looking west with the L-shaped stoa in foreground and the temple of Hera Akraia in the distance at right and the West Court in the distance at left. Immediately east of the altar was a two-storied stoa with an L-shaped plan, also thought to date to the late 4th century BCE. The eastern arm of the stoa was about north to south and about deep, while the northern arm of the stoa was about east to west and about deep.Coulton reconstructs the stoa at a height of about . The lower level employed an external colonnade of the Doric order, while the upper floor used the Ionic order. This is the first known example of this combination. The stairs to the second floor are not preserved. A water channel extended to this structure from the hydraulic system east of the sanctuary. = Double-apsidal cistern = Around east of the L-shaped stoa, there was a cistern of about with each end rounded into an apsidal shape. Stone internal piers supported the vaults for the roof. On the eastern end of the structure there was a settling tank of about . About to the northeast of the settling tank there was a diversion point in the water channel with one branch directed to the cistern and the other to the L-shaped stoa. The excavator dates the cistern to within the 6th-4th centuries BCE. = Dining rooms = View south over the water channel, the double-apsidal cistern, and the dining rooms. Immediately south of the cistern was a double dining room, probably associated with the cult activity at the site. This structure was initially identified as a Hellenistic house, but the cuttings for the legs of the dining couches make the identification as a dining room secure. Tomlinson proposes before 490 BCE as the date for this structure. = Sacred pool = Around east of the cistern, was a pool about deep thought to perhaps have a sacred function within the cult. Significant numbers of mesomphalic phialai (libation vessels) were found within this structure. This structure is now backfilled and its exact location unknown. The \\"Sacred Pool\\" features prominently in an effort by Tomlinson to reconstruct oracular practice at Perachora. He connected the phialai to divinatory practices and speculated that a ritual involving casting the phialai into the \\"Sacred Pool\\" would forecast good voyages for sailors stopping at Perachora after departing from Lechaion. Subsequent scholarship has not accepted this theory and Tomlinson views the pool as a simple reservoir. = Temple of Hera Limenaia = The temple (?) of Hera Limenaia, looking SE. Around east of the cistern lie the remains of a structure that dates perhaps to the 6th century BCE. During excavation a bronze bull was discovered, inscribed with Sikyonian letters and dating to the end of the 6th century BCE. There was a hearth at the centre of the building. It may have been a house-temple or a dining room, as evidenced by spits for roasting meat found inside. Many diagrams and reconstructions of this structure show a door in the western side-wall; the gap in the stones, however, may have been created by a trial trench dug by an earlier excavator. The \\"Temple of Hera Limenaia\\" was named by the original excavator, Payne, on the basis of an apparent inscribed dedication to \\"Hera Limenaia.\\" For some time, scholars supposed that two separate cult centers existed at Perachora. John Salmon, inter alia, has argued convincingly that Hera's cult title at Perachora was Akraia, while Limenaia was a secondary epithet. More recently, Blanche Menadier has compared the epithet Limenaia to the Homeric epithet Leukolenos, also attested epigraphically at Perachora.  Remains outside the sanctuary  Remains are known to extend for eastward from the sanctuary to a lagoon. The best preserved of these constitute an extensive hydraulic system. = Rock-cut cisterns = The stairway down into the upper rock-cut cisterns. About east- northeast of the sanctuary, there was a series of massive cisterns, reached by a rock-cut stairway extending about down into the bedrock. The opening of the stairway is northwest of the openings of the cisterns. The descent is steep and the steps are not all well-preserved. There are cuttings for a parapet wall around the vertiginous upper openings of the cisterns to prevent falls. It has been proposed that the water was raised from the cisterns to the water channel by the use of large human-powered waterwheels. = Fountain house = About east-northeast of the sanctuary, there was a hexastyle-prostyle fountain house (having six columns in its facade). Behind the facade there were three rock-cut basins, similar to the Pirene fountain house at Corinth. This structure was later incorporated into a rural villa in the Roman period. This fountain house is thought to date to the same time as the L-shaped stoa, which is the ultimate destination of the water of the system. = Aqueduct = Water channels join the upper cisterns to the fountain house and the fountain house to the cistern of the sanctuary and the L-shaped stoa. At intervals there were settling basins along the water conduit, including one immediately above the fountain house.  Significance of the site  As is the case for the rural sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron in relation to the religion of Athens, the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora is important for the study of rural cult in the Corinthia. The unusual plan of the 6th century BCE temple of Hera Akraia coupled with its location on the remains of a 9th century BCE apsidal structure are of interest to the study of the development of the Greek temple as an architectural and cultic form. While it has been proposed that the cult of Hera Akraia had chthonic elements,Menadier this idea has not been generally accepted. The reference in Strabo to an oracle may fit with the idea that the children of Medea were buried at the site, and thus explain any chthonic elements to the cult as pertaining to a heroon.

It is located in Sisaleira region, Microregion of Serrinha (Microrregi√£o de Serrinha, in Portuguese). It was emancipated on March 20, 1985 and the population according to IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠sticas - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statisticians) was 11,328 in 2005. The territorial area is 558 km¬≤. The city of P√© de Serra is situated on the slopes of the mountain Lion. The city lies between the two main mountains, Lion and Bugi. The city has several towns which serve as urban centres in addition to the city centre itself.  History  Tradition has it that three Portuguese brothers, exploring a vast region in search of fertile land in 1745, camped near Riach√£o do Jacu√≠pe, which at the time was a cattle farm. After some time of exploration, one of their dogs went missing and reappeared days later at the camp. It was given water and food. To everybody's surprise, the dog ate the food it was offered but didn't drink any of the water even though there was a drought at the time. Suspicious of the dog's strange behaviour, the brothers began to observe it more closely. They noticed that the dog went into the underbrush of gravat√° and was wet all over when it emerged again. A minadouro well was discovered at this location, and it was named as 'the heath at the foot of the mountain', from which the name ‚ÄúP√© de Serra\\" originates. The city was emancipated on March 20, 1985 as a separate entity from Riach√£o do Jacu√≠pe.  Demography  The demographic trend of the municipality points downward. The population suffered a huge decrease, from 17,048 in 1991 to 11,727 in 2004. The most likely cause for this is internal migration to other more developed regions in Bahia, especially the metropolitan region of Salvador and Feira de Santana, and migration to other states, particularly S√£o Paulo. The population of the P√© de Serra consists of people of white, brown and black skin colour. The white population is composed mostly of descendants of Portuguese, and also a few Spanish and Dutch, settlers. The blacks are tend to be descendants of slaves. The predominant religion in P√© de Serra is Roman Catholic, but other denominations are becoming more noticeable, especially evangelical Christians.  Culture  The next cultural foot-de-serrense includes the orchestra filarm√¥nica Community Association and Musical Lira August 6, in addition to the celebrations that happen in the council, as vaquejada, Corpus Christi, St. John and September 7. Some traditions are held in the city, such as the manufacture of carpets in the streets of the city centre on the day of Corpus Christi, burning of Judas on Saturday, Hallelujah and climb hills on Friday of the passion. In the city there is still no cultural centers, such as theatres, cinemas, galleries, arts, museums, but it has some bars and educational institutions, besides the Acups (Cultural Association of foot-Sierra). The Mother Church, the Brejo the foot of the Sierra and a small chapel located in the Monte Belo can be considered monuments of the city.  Economy  The Prefecture and the National Institute for Social Security (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social, INSS) are mainly responsible for the injection of resources into the economy of the municipality. Public bodies and INSS pensions are important sources of income for the economy of the municipality. The economic activity of the municipality is based mainly on agriculture and livestock. Amongst the livestock industry, rearing of cattle, sheep, pigs and goats is prominent, but herds of horses, and donkey mules are also found. There are some farms where chickens are bred for trade with other municipalities. The dairy council also contributes to the development of dairies whose products range from the traditional cottage cheese (skuta) to yogurt, in addition to increasing specialization in the production of cheese. This production, is chiefly marketed in the cities of Salvador, Feira de Santana, Cama√ßari and Juazeiro, all located in Bahia. In agriculture, the main crops are sisal (also known as agave), beans, maize, cassava, vegetables and greens. However, the plantations are increasingly scarce in the rural area of the municipality because the booming livestock industry encroaches on the space available. Other industries include an extraction plant, plantations for the growth of umbu fruit and forestry for firewood production.  Tourism  There is little tourism activity in P√© de Serra. However, some cultural activities attract visitors from other regions of the country, particularly relatives of the local population living elsewhere. On January 6, the feast of herdsmen (vaqueiros) and farmers takes place with massive participation of the local population and tourists, many attracted by the music shows, the Aboio tradition of drovers' songs, the races and the marching bands. Serra do Le√£o, view of where is the cruise. In March, visitors come to P√© de Serra for the now traditional marathon and civic pride parade, held to commemorate the anniversary of the council. At Easter, the city changes. People come together in solidarity. There is a very strong tradition of Passion plays on Good Friday on Sierra Leon and some of the other mountains that surround the city. Moreover, the ascent of both local mountains, Sierra Leon and Monte Belo, provides an adrenaline rush and contact with nature for participants. So hundreds of people make this \\"pilgrimage\\" every year. It is also at this time that usually occurs at Micareta foot of the Sierra, called \\"Pascareta.\\" In the afternoon of the Saturday of Holy Week, Charanga, the famous festival takes place, dragging a euphoric crowd through the streets of the town, dancing to the sound of sambas-de-washing, marchinhas of carnival and other melodies. At night, the festival finishes with the burning of \\"Judas\\" in a public square. This show is a particular attraction for tourists because it is not just a firework display but an explosion of joy stimulated by the excitement of the pyrotechnic display. Before the burning of Judas, his 'will' is read out, which is a review of events and the main characters that marked the previous year.

As of mid-2014, he has walked over and has crossed Great Britain, Iceland, United States and New Zealand. He has used the walks to raise money and awareness for various causes, including conservation biology, people with disabilities, cancer relief, AIDS, and hospice. Education Skinner earned his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) combined honours degree in biochemistry and genetics from the University of Leeds. He earned his PhD in molecular biology from University College London. He earned his Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in secondary science from Canterbury Christ Church University. Walking around the world =Scotland to England in 1984= He began at the age of 18 at John o' Groats (at the northern tip of Scotland) in 1984, and walked to Land's End in England. On this journey, which he carried out with three other people, he pushed a wheelchair and raised ¬£3,500 for The Forelands School for handicapped children. In 1983, he had already run around a 400-metre track to raise further money for The Forelands School for handicapped children, at Broadstairs in Kent. =Iceland in 1986= In 1986, at the age of 20, whilst at the University of Leeds, he crossed Iceland, together with three other people, from Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur in the east, through the interior to the north of the Vatnaj√∂kull ice fields, and then west to Reykjav√≠k. The team encountered an 'ash storm', where storm force winds had whipped up fine black volcanic ash, and had to wear goggles and face masks to push on into the winds. In the rain shadow of the Vatnaj√∂kull, they ran out of water, then encountered a flash flood, as mud rushed down from the melting glaciers. They also had to survive on food contaminated with petrol that had leaked from their petrol stoves. This journey of raised ¬£2,000 for the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation. As part of the training for the walk across Iceland he ran the Leeds Marathon, in a time of 3 hours and 41 minutes. On the Icelandic trek, he came up with the idea of walking , across Britain and America to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support in Britain and hospice in America and Canada. =Scotland to England in 1988= On 1 May 1988, he set off again from John o' Groats, this time walking through the West Highlands, down the Pennine Way and then south to Land's End: a distance of in seven weeks. As part of the training for this walk he ran the gruelling Snowdonia Marathon, in a time of 4 hours and 40 minutes. The walk through Scotland and England raised ¬£2,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.Taking a walk across America, East Kent Mercury, 7 July 1988 =Across the U.S.A. in 1988/1989= Colin Skinner walking by the Teton Mountains The journey across the United States began on 15 July 1988. On the journey he slept in bushes beneath the World Trade Center, camped outside Kennedy Airport in a tent, then headed west. On Staten Island he collapsed from heat exhaustion at 105 degrees Fahrenheit. In Utah the temperatures went down to minus 30 Fahrenheit. Carrying a tent and a backpack, with no backup, he walked alone to Niagara Falls, through Ontario in Canada, to Detroit, between the Great Lakes, across the Great Plains, through the Rockies in winter, to Yellowstone National Park, then south to the Grand Canyon, on to Las Vegas, through Death Valley and then snowshoed over the Sierras to reach San Francisco. In Death Valley, down to his last $13, Skinner found $200 in the desert, and he had $1 left when he crossed the Sierras to reach Yosemite Valley. The total distance he walked from New York City to San Francisco, was .Scotland to S.F. 6,000-Mile Hike for Hospices San Francisco Chronicle, 22 March 1989 On the journey he visited 70 hospices and appeared on television, radio and in newspapers to encourage support for hospices across the U.S. and Canada. The mayor of San Francisco, Art Agnos, proclaimed 21 March 1989, \\"Colin Skinner Day,\\" in recognition of the attention he brought to the work of hospices with AIDS patients in the city. Returning to Britain after this walk, he obtained a job as a research assistant in Chemical Pathology at the Middlesex Hospital and went on to obtain a PhD in Molecular Biology at University College London. In 1992, whilst studying for his PhD, he also ran the London Marathon, in a time of 4 hours and 41 minutes, to raise money to buy a computer for a young boy with physical disabilities. Skinner's PhD involved developing genetic tests to detect congenital adrenal hyperplasia in children.Rumsby, G., Skinner, C., Lee, H.A. & Honour, J.W. (1992). Combined 17Œ±-hydroxylase/ 17,20 lyase deficiency caused by heterozygous stop codons in the cytochrome P450 17Œ±-hydroxylase gene. Clin. Endocrinol. 39:483-485.

The work he carried out there involved gene sequencing and protein purification of cytochrome P450 enzymes. His work was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.Keeney D.S., Skinner C., Wei S., Friedberg T., Waterman M.R. (1998). A keratinocyte-specific epoxygenase, CYP2B12, metabolizes arachidonic acid with unusual selectivity producing a single major epoxyeicosatrienoic acid. J. Biol. Chem. 273 15:9279-9284 From 1996 to 1997 Skinner took care of his infant son, James, whilst his wife continued to work at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. =New Zealand in 1998= In 1998 he walked from Cape Reinga in the North Island, to Bluff, at the southern tip of New Zealand; a distance of . On the journey he walked through the active volcano at White Island, experienced earthquakes up to 4.9 on the Richter Scale, clambered over glaciers, swam with seals and reported on conservation biology projects involving endangered species. Information from the journey was posted on the Internet for schoolchildren in the U.S. via the Scholastic Corporation Scholastic Network. In December 2010 Skinner completed a book about the journey and conservation biology, New Zealand - 1500 miles on foot through - The Land Of The Long White Cloud on an Internet website. In 1999 he obtained a PGCE (Postgraduate Certificate in Education) from Canterbury Christ Church University in Canterbury, England. In 2000 he worked as a secondary school science teacher at St. Edmund's School in Dover, teaching 11 to 16-year-olds.What is it about teaching that's enticing so many of us Back to School? The Sunday Express Magazine, 7 November 1999 In 2001 he worked as a volunteer at a wildlife park, working on enrichment activities for animals. From 2001 until 2003 he worked part-time at a post office. During this time, he also taught science to primary school children, in a 'Link-Scientist' scheme run by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, and took care of his son. In 2003 his mother died from pancreatic cancer, at the age of 59. This prompted him to write the story of the journey across Britain and America. In 2006 he finished the book Beyond the Setting Sun, with an introduction by Ranulph Fiennes, the renowned polar explorer and adventurer.Dr. Colin Skinner's Site  Walking 6000 miles for hospice The book was written to raise money for hospices in Britain, Canada and America. =Scotland to England in 2007= On 29 April 2007, he began walking again at John o' Groats and arrived at Land's End on 8 June, having covered in 6 weeks. On the walk in Britain he visited 20 hospices and raised ¬£10,000 for hospice through sales of his Beyond the Setting Sun book. =U.S.A. in 2009= balaclava during snow storm in North Dakota Starting on 22 August 2009, he walked from Kennedy Airport in New York City to within 15 miles of Devil's Lake, North Dakota. This was a distance of and Skinner stopped his journey on 3 December 2009, after 3 days with windchills down to -30 Fahrenheit. During the trip Skinner had to make incisions in his feet to relieve the pressure from blisters, suffered food poisoning, met up with a wolf in Upper Michigan, had to face down two wild dogs, and had ski masks frozen to his beard in North Dakota. On the journey he appeared on television, radio and in newspaper articles. He also wrote a daily blog for the National Hospice Foundation. He met hospice patients, including one woman with a terminal illness, who said that at times she could forget she was ill, thanks to the care she received in a hospice house in Buffalo, New York. He also met a man with lung cancer who could not sleep in hospitals, where there was always someone coming to check on him. In the hospice house in Windsor, Ontario, the man had a peaceful room to himself, where he could finally get some rest. =U.S.A. in 2011= On 10 September 2011, Skinner set off from mile marker 283 on U.S. Route 2, before Devil's Lake, North Dakota and walked to Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park, California. The walk took him through North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and into California. Skinner snow-shoed over Tioga Pass and camped in a tent in the Sierra Mountains for several nights, but was forced to stop walking after suffering from frostbite in both feet. On the journey he appeared on television, radio and in newspapers and encouraged support for hospices taking care of people with serious illnesses. Skinner is now writing a book about this journey, entitled America- 12000 miles on foot, a wing and a prayer. In September 2012, Skinner completed a short story, entitled Chenga, and published this on an Internet website. In October 2012, Skinner completed the second part of a science-fiction fantasy trilogy, entitled Djara, and published this on an Internet website. Skinner has now begun writing the third part of the science-fiction fantasy trilogy, entitled Tau. The Chenga, Djara, Tau trilogy includes the themes of time travel, parallel universes, vampires, shapeshifters, angels, demons and descendants of the fabled giants known as the Nephilim. In 2012 Skinner published four short poems: Gaia, The Dreaming, New Zealand Water Torture and Life Jim But Not As We Know It on an Internet website. He is planning future walks through Australia, Japan, China, Tibet, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Egypt and Europe.

Once an independent village in County Durham it became incorporated into the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear in 1974 as part of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. Location Clara Vale stands on the south bank of the River Tyne in a low-lying and quite secluded spot. Crawcrook borders the hamlet to the south. To the north, across the river, is the village of Wylam in Northumberland. It is notable for being the first settlement in Tyne and Wear that the river Tyne reaches and passes after leaving Northumberland. Politics In local government, Clara Vale is located in the 'Crawcrook, Greenside and Clara Vale ward' of Gateshead Council. The ward is at the far west of Gateshead and borders part of Northumberland. The ward is served by three councillors (two Labour and one Liberal Democrat). Gateshead Council is Labour controlled. Clara Vale is located within the parliamentary constituency of Blaydon. Its current MP is Labour's Liz Twist. History Before the colliery and village were developed, a water-driven corn mill called Crawcrook Mill stood near the centre of the current village.http://www.twsitelines.info/smr/525 Clara Vale was built as a colliery community at the time the coal mine was opened in July 1893. Both pit and housing were purpose built by the Stella Coal Company. The mine closed down in February 1966, around the same time as many other nearby pits such as Emma, Greenside and Stargate.http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/c005.htm The colliery and settlement were named after the wife of colliery owner John Bell Simpson, Clara (n√©e Draper).http://www.dmm.org.uk/whoswho/s922.htm There are early references to Claraville and some old maps refer to the village as Claravale.http://maps.nls.uk/view/74466881 Modern-day Clara Vale There is very little in the way of modern housing, only the one terraced street, built in the traditional style of the village. Of the other non-pit housing and buildings, there is only the chapel and former school (now a community centre). There are no local shops. By avoiding the suburbanisation experienced by nearby towns and villages such as Crawcrook, Greenside and Ryton. Clara Vale has retained its rural character completely. Farms and countryside surrounds the village. This includes a local nature reserve which stands at the site of the old colliery. Due to its small size, Clara Vale has limited amenities and local services. However, nearby Crawcrook and Ryton offer a range of shops and services and both of these are within walking distance of the village so whilst Clara Vale remains secluded, it is by no means isolated. Clara Vale does, however, have three nearby golf courses. Ryton golf course, in Clara Vale itself; Tyneside golf club in Ryton and, over the river to the north, Close House golf club in Wylam. The village also has a recreation ground, originally provided by the pit owners for the miners' welfare. The recreation ground has a football pitch and a cricket pitch with pavilion. Clara Vale Cricket Club play matches at the recreation ground on Saturdays during the Summer, with Ovingham Bridge End Cricket Club playing on some Sundays and Merz and McLellan Cricket Club on some Wednesday evenings. Clara Vale FC junior teams also play on the pitch at the Recreation Ground. Clara Vale Local Nature Reserve is located next to the recreation ground.

It features many prominent Israeli actors of the time, most notably Shaike Ophir and Sefi Rivlin. The film takes a satirical, comic look at the old generation of Israeli politicians. Plot Amitz Dolniker, an aging Israeli Parliament member known for his high-winded babbling and tireless lecturing, is told he needs to take a break from politics after he collapses during a speech. Fainting, he starts out on a dream trip to spend some weeks in a far-away, backward Israeli village that has little contact with civilization. The farmers‚Äô bucolic and carefree life repels him at first (and especially the fact that they have never heard of him), but then he decides to introduce some ‚Äúorder‚Äù to the innocent society. As none of the villagers agree to become the village head (they don‚Äôt want the trouble), Dolniker hires a local horse and buggy and puts it at the service of the village barber, declaring him village head ‚Äúde facto‚Äù. The barber objects at first, but as he becomes used to the perks that come along with the position, his grip on power tightens. This leads to a rivalry with other villagers (especially the cobbler) who think themselves equally worthy of becoming the village head (with free horse-and-buggy, of course), which is what Dolniker has expected. He suggests an election to determine the leader. The result, however, bears no resemblance to the orderly political process he is used to, and Dolniker finds himself entangled in silly power struggles, taxes imposed on 3-door closets, corruption, petty bureaucracy, and a ruination of the simple way of life the village once knew.

Spy on Day He Fell Ill Is Arrested, nytimes.com, DEC. 25, 2006 The April 2006 general election was won by Romano Prodi's centre-left L'Unione, and in November 2006, the new Italian parliament instituted a commission to investigate the Mitrokhin Commission for allegations that it was manipulated for political purposes.  Members of the commission  The inter- parliamentary commission was composed by the following twenty Senators and twenty Representatives: The President Sen. Paolo Guzzanti; the Vicepresidents Andrea Papini and Giovanni Mongiello; the secretaries Giampaolo Zancan and Salvatore Meleleo; the Senators Giulio Andreotti, Guglielmo Castagnetti, Mario Cavallaro, Amedeo Ciccanti, Cinzia Dato, Luciano Falcier, Costantino Garraffa, Mario Gasbarri, Lauro Salvatore, Loris Giuseppe Maconi, Lucio Malan, Luigi Marino, Franco Mugnai, Gianni Nieddu, Lodovico Pace, Piergiorgio Stiffoni, Roberto Ulivi, Lodovico Pace, Piergiorgio Stiffoni, Roberto Ulivi; the deputies Ferdinando Adornato, Gabriele Albonetti, Maurizio Bertucci, Valter Bielli, Francesco Carboni, Fabrizio Cicchitto, Giuseppe Cossiga, Oliviero Diliberto, Lino Duilio, Giuseppe Fallica, Vincenzo Fragal√†, Pierfrancesco Emilio Romano Gamba, Francesco Giordano, Giuseppe Lezza, Giuseppe Molinari, Erminio Angelo Quartiani, Enzo Raisi, Giacomo Stucchi.  Allegations  Allegations of KGB ties, which were denied and ruled defamatory in nature in court, included former (and current) Premier Romano Prodi, named as the \\"KGB's man in Italy\\", his staff, Hon. Massimo D'Alema, Hon. Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the CESIS), Milan's judges Armando Spataro, and Guido Salvini, both in charge of the Imam Rapito case, as well as La Repubblica reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who broke the Yellowcake forgery scandal. Also known as the \\"Niger uranium forgeries\\", this latter affair refers to falsified classified documents provided by the Italian SISMI to US intelligence. These forgeries depicted an attempt by the regime of Iraq's Saddam Hussein to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger during the Iraq armament crisis, and was part of the rationale for the Iraq War cited by the Bush administration to invade Iraq in 2003. = The \\"Bulgarian connection\\" claim = Guzzanti also revived the old \\"Bulgarian connection\\" thesis concerning Mehmet Ali Agca's 1981 attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. He claimed in the draft of the report, without providing evidence to back his claim, that \\"leaders of the former Soviet Union were behind the assassination attempt\\", alleging that \\"the leadership of the Soviet Union took the initiative to eliminate Pope John Paul\\" because of his support for Solidarity, the Polish trade-union, relaying \\"this decision to the military secret services\\" (and not the KGB). According to Frank Brodhead, however, the new conclusions brought by Guzzanti were based on the same \\"information\\" provided in the early 1980s by Mr. Michael Ledeen, a U.S. neo- conservative author tied to the SISMI and Mehmet Ali Agca himself, which is \\"bogus at best and at worst deliberately misleading.\\" The \\"Bulgarian connection\\" thesis was debunked by Francesco Pazienza, a member of Propaganda Due, cited in a 1987 article in The Nation as well as by media analyst Edward S. Herman in 1986: The Rise and Fall of the Bulgarian Connection. Pazienza claimed that Michael Ledeen \\"was the person responsible for dreaming up the 'Bulgarian connection' behind the plot to kill the Pope.\\" Ledeen admitted to the Vanity Fair to having been paid $10,000 by the SISMI in 1979 or 1980, allegedly on extradition matters with the US.The War They Wanted, The Lies They Needed, Vanity Fair, July 2006 Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs, who had initially believed this conspiracy theory, later wrote that \\"the Bulgarian connection was invented by Agca with the hope of winning his release from prison. He was aided and abetted in this scheme by right-wing conspiracy theorists in the United States and William Casey's Central Intelligence Agency, which became a victim of its own disinformation campaign.\\" Guzzanti said that the commission had decided to re-open the report's chapter on the assassination attempt in 2005, after the Pope wrote about it in his last book, Memory and Identity: Conversations Between MillenniumsPope John Paul II: Memory and Identity: Conversations at the Dawn of a Millennium, Random House, 2005. The Pope wrote that he was convinced the shooting was not Aƒüca's initiative and that \\"someone else masterminded it and someone else commissioned it\\".\\"Around Christmas 1983 I visited my attacker in prison. We spoke at length. Ali Agca, as everyone knows, was a professional assassin. This means that the attack was not his own initiative, it was someone else's idea, someone else had commissioned him to carry it out.\\" Excerpt from the final conversation with Pope John Paul II and his personal secretary Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz in the small dining room at Castel Gandolfo. In: Pope John Paul II: Memory and Identity: Conversations at the Dawn of a Millennium, Random House, 2005 Guzzanti's claims in the draft report were based on recent computer analysis of photographs that purported to demonstrate suspected conspirator Sergei Antonov's presence in St Peter's Square during the shooting and on information brought by the French anti-terrorist judge Jean-Louis Brugui√®re, a controversial figure whose last feat was to indict Rwandese president Paul Kagame, claiming he had deliberately provoked the 1994 Rwandan genocide against his own ethnic group in order to take the power. Rwanda : Brugui√®re incrimine Paul Kagam√©, Le Figaro, 21 November 2006 According to Le Figaro, Brugui√®re, who is in close contacts as well with Moscow as with Washington, D.C., including the CIA and the FBI, has been accused by many of his colleagues of \\"privileging the raison d'√©tat over law.\\"Le Figaro, 22 November 2006, \\"Un juge provocateur\\", p.2 In its Final Report, issued March 15th 2006, the Mitrokhin Commission notes on page 248 that Brugui√®re during the course of his investigations allegedly gained information strongly indicating that the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II. was orchestrated by the GRU, the foreign military intelligence agency of the former Soviet Union. \\"Disse Brugui√®re che a lui risultava in maniera certissima che l'attentato al Papa fosse opera del GRU, di aver avuto modo di disporre di questa informazione durante la sua inchiesta e di aver avuto modo di riscontrarla e verificarla, anche se essa esulava completamente dagli scopi della sua investigazione.\\" on p.248 in: DOCUMENTO CONCLUSIVO SULL'ATTIVIT√Ä SVOLTA E SUI RISULTATI DELL'INCHIESTA presentato dal presidente senatore Paolo Guzzanti e dai commissari senatori - 15 marzo 2006, La Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta concernente il \\"dossier Mitrokhin\\" e l'attivit√† d'intelligence italiana / robertochicco.com Brugui√®re's information supporting the \\"Bulgarian connection\\" in the attempted assassination allegedly sprang from the prosecution of Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos the Jackal, held in France since his capture in Sudan in 1994.Italy: Soviets Tried To Kill Pope, cbsnews.com, March 3, 2006 Soviets Behind Pope's Shooting, Italy Panel Says, latimes.com, March 03, 2006 Both Russia and Bulgaria condemned the report. \\"For Bulgaria, this case closed with the court decision in Rome in March 1986\\", Foreign Ministry spokesman Dimitar Tsanchev said, while also recalling the Pope's comments during his May 2002 visit to Bulgaria.Reuters, 2 March 2006. \\"Soviet Union ordered Pope shooting: Italy commission\\".

Mitrokhin, la magistratura indaga, l'Udc prende le distanze 2006-12-08 In the interceptions, Guzzanti declared that the Mitrokhin Commission's unstated goal was to depict Romano Prodi and Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, leader of the Federation of the Greens and current Minister of Environment in Prodi's government, as \\"agents of the KGB\\", financed by Moscow in order to discredit him. In these interceptions, the two men also discussed plans to claim that Antonio Bassolino, governor of the Campania region, was linked to the Camorra. According to the Corriere della Sera, these interceptions demonstrated that Scaramella was in contact with Italian police agents, penitentiary police agents, and two CIA agents, one of them being Robert Seldon Lady, former CIA station chief in Milan, indicted by prosecutor Armando Spataro for having coordinated the abduction of Abu Omar in 2003 in Milan, a case of extraordinary rendition which gave rise to the Imam Rapito affair.Corriere della Sera 30 November 2006 Cos√¨ la Mitrokhin indagava su Prodi- URL accessed on 2007-02-27 Scaramella, according to the interceptions, was to collect false witnesses among KGB refugees in Europe to support this aim. He was arrested end of December 2006 on charges of calumny and illegal weapons' trade. The investigation showed that Scaramella received some of his \\"information\\" from Alexander Litvinenko. Scaramella was then an obscure figure, described as follows by the International Herald Tribune: > a slew of media reports about him and his career here ‚Äî which included > trying to prove that some top Italian center-left politicians, including > Prime Minister Romano Prodi, are Russian spies ‚Äî have invariably included > unflattering adjectives. They include: \\"incurable liar\\", \\"wannabe 007\\", > \\"braggart\\", \\"bumbler\\" and \\"swindler\\" ‚Äî not to mention \\"fool\\" and \\"mental > case.

URL accessed on 2007-01-24. Nonetheless, from 2003 to 2006, he worked for the Mitrokhin Commission. When a left-wing member of the Commission questioned his credentials, he promptly remade one. According to the investigations of Rome prosecutor Pietro Salvitti, who indicted Mario Scaramella, cited by La Repubblica, Nicol√≤ Pollari, head of SISMI indicted in the Imam Rapito affair, as well as SISMI n¬∞2, Marco Mancini, arrested in July 2006 for the same reason, were some of the informers, alongside Mario Scaramella, of senator Paolo Guzzanti. Beside targeting Romano Prodi and his staff, this \\"network\\", according to Pietro Salvitti's words, also aimed at defaming General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the CESIS), Milan's judges Armando Spataro, in charge of the Imam Rapito case and Guido Salvini, as well as La Repubblica reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who broke the Yellowcake forgery scandal as well as the SISMI-Telecom affair, in which Marco Mancini, n¬∞2 of the SISMI already indicted in the Imam Rapito affair, was arrested for end of 2006.Il falso dossier di Scaramella - \\"Cos√¨ la Russia manipola Prodi\\", La Repubblica, 11 January 2007 The investigation also showed a connection between Scaramella and the CIA, in particular through Filippo Marino, one of Scaramella's closest partners since the 1990s and co-founder of the Environmental Crime Prevention Program (ECPP), described as an empty shell according to the International Herald Tribune.

It is located south of Minot, North Dakota; on the west side of US Highway 83. It was closed in 1979. A portion of the property was reopened in 1984 as the Minot Communications Site and served until 1997. Minot Air Force Station was the first major Air Force installation in North Dakota, even predating the two \\"large\\" bases, Minot Air Force Base and Grand Forks Air Force Base.  History  Minot Air Force Station was part of the last batch of twenty-three radar stations constructed as part of the Air Defense Command permanent network. It was activated on 20 May 1951 at Max, ND, and declared completely operational in 1952. The 786th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operations with AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-5 radars in April 1952, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. It was named Minot Air Force Station on 1 December 1953. During 1957 an AN/GPS-3 search radar saw brief use. In 1958 the original radars were replaced by AN/FPS-20 search and AN/FPS-6 height-finder sets. A second height-finder set, AN/FPS-6B, was installed during the following year. During 1961 Minot AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-20 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 786th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. By the end of 1961 the search set had been upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-28. An AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar was installed in 1964, and the AN/FPS-6 was retired. The AN/FPS-6B was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90 also that year. In 1964 the site received an AN/FPS-27 search radar which became fully operational in early 1965. The AN/FPS-66 was removed later in 1965. In 1968 the AN/FPS-90 was retired. In addition to the main facility, Minot operated three unmanned AN/FPS-14 (P-28A) and AN/FPS-18 (P-28B/C) Gap Filler sites: * Niobe, ND (P-28A) * Regan, ND (P-28D) * Alexander, ND (P-28E) The Alexander site was reassigned to Minot after Dickinson AFS (Z-177) closed in 1965. The site is now home to the Watford City Joint Surveillance System (JSS) (ARSR-4) LRR site (Z-300/J-76). Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In early 1979 the Air Force announced that the station would be closing due to what was called \\"redundancies with more strategically located radars\\".need reference On 29 September 1979 the 786th Radar Squadron was inactivated and the station was closed. In 1984, a portion of the station was reopened by the USAF as the Minot Communication Site. It was closed again in 1997 and struck from the USAF property register and liquidated c.. 1998. Minot AFS has been sold to civilian interests, and has been reused as a housing subdivision colloquially known as the Radar Base.  Buildings and facilities  Buildings on the station include: ; Gate : The controlled entry point to the station ; Recreation hall ; Transmitter building : Used for radio contact with airborne aircraft and other ground stations ; Search radar tower ; Height finder radar tower ; (2) Radomes : The radome \\"balloons\\", made up of several layers of latex rubber-coated nylon, are held up by one-tenth pound of air pressure per square inch. In the event of wind (a common occurrence in North Dakota), the pressure within the \\"balloon\\" is automatically adjusted by blowers. ; Heating plant : Steam heat is provided for the entire station by two coal-fired boilers. There is a 70,000-gallon water reservoir fed by two wells. The heating plant used approximately 1,000 tons of coal annually. ; Hose houses : Hose houses are insulated huts for fire hydrants. Six are located at strategic locations around the station. ; Air Installations Building : This is the building that most of the 17 civilian contractors work out of. ; Water distribution plant ; Water purification plant : 20,000 gallons of high-alkaline water get processed into potable water daily by using 94%-concentrate sulfuric acid plus other filtering and purifying chemicals. ; Living quarters : (2) Barracks : (25) Houses ; Motor Pool : The pumps are fed by a 4,000-gallon underground gasoline storage tank, and the station uses in excess of 1,000 gallons monthly. Only minor repairs and preventative maintenance are performed here, the rest being contracted to local businesses. ; Operations Building : The \\"Mission Central\\" of the base where most of the operations of the base are performed. ; Chapel ; Dining hall ; Dispensary : Although mostly a first aid station, there is a fully qualified medic on duty here 24 hours a day.

The Shin-Keihan Railway took the control of the railway in 1923. The Awaji - Tenjimbashi (present-day Tenjimbashisuji Rokuch≈çme) section opened in 1925 (1435 mm gauge, dual track), electrified at 600 VDC, and in 1928 the voltage was increased to 1500 VDC. With the terminal at Tenjimbashi, this section was a part of the main line of the Shin-Keihan Railway (later the Shin-Keihan Line of the Keihan Electric Railway) connecting Kyoto and Osaka. The Senriyama - Shin-Senriyama (now Minami-Senri) section opened in 1963, and was extended to Kita-Senri in 1967 (both dual track and electrified). These extensions were to serve the newly developed Senri New Town. After the Shinkeihan lines were merged to Hankyu in 1943, the role of Tenjimbashi Station as the terminal was gradually shifted to Umeda, the terminal built by Hankyu, and ended in 1969 when the through- running from Tenjimbashisuji Rokuch≈çme (replacing the old terminal with a single underground platform) to the Osaka Subway Sakaisuji Line commenced. In 1970, the line was one of major access routes to Expo '70 with the temporary Expo West Gate Station.

As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 3,180. Loxahatchee Groves was incorporated November 1, 2006, as the 38th municipality in Palm Beach County. The first election for town council members was held on March 13, 2007. Although Loxahatchee Groves did not become a municipality until 2006, the area had been settled since 1917. Billing itself as \\"Florida's Last Frontier\\", Loxahatchee Groves was primarily incorporated to better protect the area from encroaching urbanization as nearby cities continued to develop and to preserve the area's rural character. The town derives its name from the Loxahatchee River; \\"Loxahatchee\\" is from the Seminole words lowchow (turtle) and hatchee (river), thus translating to \\"river of turtles\\". Loxahatchee Groves is bounded on the east by Royal Palm Beach, on the south by Wellington, and on the west and north by The Acreage and Loxahatchee. It has an area of approximately . History The area now known as Loxahatchee Groves was originally a portion of the of land purchased by the Southern States Land and Timber Company in 1902. Shortly after completion of the West Palm Beach (C-51) Canal - which connected downtown West Palm Beach to Lake Okeechobee at Canal Point for the purpose of transporting crops by water - in 1917, Southern States sales manager, and later president, George Frederick Bensel envisioned a \\"waterfront\\" farming community. Bensel and company engineer Torvald Garfield \\"T. G.\\" Thorgesen both created the first topographical map of Loxahatchee Groves during the following three years. After Bensel, Thorgesen, and others established the Palm Beach Loxahatchee Company, they bought from the Southern States Land and Timber Company, naming the land \\"Loxahatchee Farms\\". The Palm Beach Loxahatchee Company would build almost of canals and roads, which were to be maintained by the Loxahatchee Groves Drainage District, now known as the Loxahatchee Groves Water Control District. In 1925, Bensel opened a combined gas station, grocery store, and post office. Loxahatchee Groves received extensive damage during the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, with almost every home knocked off of their foundations. In the 1930s, Bensel's brother Thomas began a project which encouraged residents to plant citrus, resulting in about 56,000 new trees being planted. During that time, a water pump was built at State Road 80 (Southern Boulevard) and D Road, allowing water to be drawn from the West Palm Beach Canal. The Palm Beach Loxahatchee Company sold Loxahatchee Groves to Loxahatchee Investments in 1958. Production of citrus and tomatoes gradually ceased following George Bensel's death in 1961. With significant development in Royal Palm Beach and Wellington in the 1980s and 1990s, some residents of Loxahatchee Groves believed the rural lifestyle and landscape of the area was under threat. Consequently, a movement for incorporating Loxahatchee Groves for the purpose of preserving the rural lifestyle of the area began in 2003. On October 10, 2006, residents voted 458‚Äì350 in favor of incorporation, making Loxahatchee Groves the 38th municipality in Palm Beach County. The first election for town council members was held on March 13, 2007. Dave Autrey, David Browning, Marge Herzog, Bill Louda, and Dennis Lipp were the first elected council members, while Browning was selected to be mayor and Herzog was chosen to be vice mayor at the first town council meeting on March 29. Prior to the election, a political forum for the candidates was hosted at a naturist resort, drawing a crowd of about 100 people.

The design of the M70 was based on the Soviet AKM rifle and it became the standard issue weapon in the Yugoslav People's Army in 1970. This weapon is also available as the ZPAPM70 (1.0 stamped receiver), ZPAPM70 Classic (1.5mm stamped receiver with bulged RPK style front trunnion, chrome lined bore), O-PAP (1.5mm stamped receiver with bulged RPK style front trunnion) or N-PAP (1.0mm stamped receiver, standard AKM style front trunnion) in the United States without select fire capabilities. History South Sudanese soldier with an M70 in 2016 Development of the domestic Kalashnikov variant began in 1959, and the first models submitted by Zastava for military field trials were with the early M64 (or M59) series of rifles with milled receivers, threaded barrels, familiar Zastava handguards, gas cutoffs for grenade launching, and several other diversities from the mainstay AK design, such as a bolt hold open device on the right side of the receiver, and a charging handle that appeared different from other AK models. Though performances were satisfactory, the Yugoslav military did not adopt the rifle as the standard infantry armament. various Zastava M64 prototypes In 1970, the green light was given to begin with army-funded mass production of the AP M70 and M70 A series (Automatska Pu≈°ka Model 1970, \\"Automatic Rifle Model 1970\\") of which the M70 A was the folding stock version. It became the standard issue weapon in the Yugoslav People's Army in 1970. Before the larger models of these rifles were made, cost-cutting measures in production resulted in the removal of the internal bolt hold open, and relocation to the magazine follower. This change eliminated any possible speed up in the reloading procedure (due to the bolt closing upon removal of the magazine) but allowed the operator to more easily identify if the current magazine is empty. Some rifles were also equipped with a notched selector control which allowed you to lock the bolt rearward by closing the dust cover on the charging handle. In addition, the usual placement of the barrel through threading into the receiver was replaced by the cheaper method of pressing and pinning the barrel into the receiver. Rifles produced with these new features were known as models AP M70 B (fixed stock version), and M70 AB (folding stock version). As with the M70 series of automatic rifles, these models failed to be produced in larger quantities before further cost-efficiency production measures gave way to yet another model. This time the milled receiver was replaced by a receiver stamped from a smooth thick sheet of steel, a firing rate reducer was added to the trigger group, and the muzzle brake replaced the muzzle nut that originally came on the two prior models; the produced models were AP M70B1 (fixed stock) and M70 AB1 (folding stock). These models eventually failed to mass-produce as well, before final alterations to the M70 rifle design resulted in the AP M70 B2 (fixed stock) and M70AB2 (folding stock) models. These last two models featured a thicker stamped receiver and bulged front trunnion, which was intended to strengthen the rifle in order to make it more suitable for frequent grenade launching. These two models would become the most widely produced of the M70 series, and in turn, the most widely used model used by the JNA, as well as the other militaries and various armed groups fighting in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. Parts kits imported into the U.S. however, show markings that appear to contradict the final fixed stock model name. On these kits, the bulged, thicker stamped receiver model is actually the M70B1 model. All of the M70 models share the grenade launching ability with gas cutoff, the lengthened wooden handguard with 3 cooling slots, iron sights with flip-up illuminating elements, initially filled with phosphorus and later with tritium (Which is used on the current production M70's), to improve aiming at night; the plunger that keeps the receiver cover in place during grenade launching, and a non-chrome lined barrel. Fire selectors have R markings for automatic fire (R for rafalna, \\"burst fire\\") and J for semi-automatic fire (J for jedinaƒçna, \\"single\\"). In the US market, the notched safety lever and bolt hold open magazines have been emulated by many companies as aftermarket accessories for other AKs. There also has been at least one attempt to recreate the original internal bolt stop. The M70 and all of its variations were well accepted by the professional soldiers and conscripts of the Yugoslav People's Army. It was nicknamed \\"Ciganka\\" and \\"Srpinkja\\" meaning Gypsy and Serbian Girl respectively, due to dark finish on its metallic parts.http://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2016/06/zastava-m-70-or- gypsy.html Design and features Zastava M70 rifle with grenade sights raised. The M70 is designed on the basis of Kalashnikov principle; however, it can easily be told apart from other AK rifles by the three cooling slots on the foregrip, the light-coloured elm wood furniture and, both, the black rubber buttplate and lack of receiver tangs on fixed-stock M70s. The M70s also have a grenade-launching sight and gas cut-off on the gas block, and are capable of launching rifle-grenades. To launch them a 22 mm diameter grenade launching adapter is screwed on in place of the slant brake or other muzzle device. The receiver of the M70 is 1.5 mm thick, compared to the 1 mm thick receiver of the AKM, making it more rigid. The receiver has a bulge at the front to accommodate an enlarged trunnion similar to a RPK receiver, with the front trunnion rivet configuration likewise resembling a RPK and not an AKM. Much like the other AKs, the M70 experienced changes to other parts between the milled and stamped variants, such as moving the gas relief ports from the tube to the gas block, adding lightening cuts on the bolt and bolt carrier, moving the rear sling swivel from the back of the receiver to the buttstock and omission of the metal ferrules from the lower handguards and pistol grips. It however, like the Type 56, retained many milled features, such as the thicker barrel, front sight shape, bolt and bolt carrier \\"in the white\\", smooth dust cover, lack of a pistol grip reinforcement plate on underfolders, forward sling loop on the gas block and blued finish. Intriguingly, the M70 always used the AKM style bayonets with lug under the gas block even on milled versions. Likewise, the barrel is hammer forged and was never chrome-lined, making it a little more accurate than a standard AKM, but at the cost of increased susceptibility to corrosion and shorter barrel life. The lack of chrome lining is unique for an AK and consistent with other Zastava built rifles of Soviet design (such as the Yugoslavian M59 or M59/66). The fixed stock versions have a unique rear trunnion and stock attachment method, with the two rivets in a vertical strait line and a large bolt passing through the majority of the stock and connecting it to the rear trunnion. Like the East German MPi-KM, the fixed stocks also lacked a storage compartment for the cleaning kit. It also has flip up tritium night sights like the RK 62 and IMI Galil. Unlike other AK variants, a lock button must be depressed on the left side of the receiver as the first step for field stripping, to enable depressing the rear spring guide to remove the receiver dust cover. It is probable this feature is intended to prevent the loss of the top cover due to recoil when firing rifle grenades. Variants A Zastava M70 AB3.

Early life A native of La Guaira, Venezuela, Oraa moved to the United States as a teenager due to a catastrophic event in her hometown known as the Vargas tragedy. In 1999, the geographic center of Vargas state suffered devastating floods and landslides, which resulted in a major loss of life and property, forced population movements, and the virtual disappearance of several small towns in Vargas state. Career Oraa started her television career at age 18 as an entertainment reporter for TV Azteca in Miami. She also gained experience working with Fox Sports en Espa√±ol, covering special events such as Super Bowl XLI. In 2008, Oraa was chosen for a new style of reality morning show at one of Miami's most popular Hispanic radio stations, Romance 106.7 FM. There she hosted Hola Miami, a reality morning show featuring three women born in different decades. The show was later renamed Paparazzi Radio Sensacional. While working in radio, Oraa became known as the voice of numerous international campaigns for HBO's Sex and the City, Olive Garden, Ford, and Marshalls. In 2010, she joined the news team of Mega TV to become part of the journalistic team of Mega News, a national newscast that covered the breaking stories of the day. Oraa is one of the news anchors for CNN en Espa√±ol's morning show Caf√© CNN, a four-hour program that airs weekdays between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. (ET) designed to blend hard news with human interest and lifestyle improvement information to help viewers \\"stay ahead in today‚Äôs competitive world.\\" At 23, she became the youngest news anchor for CNN en Espa√±ol and its affiliates.

Thus, if in the training set positive examples are observed 60% of the time, and negative examples are observed 40% of the time, then the observer using a probability-matching strategy will predict (for unlabeled examples) a class label of \\"positive\\" on 60% of instances, and a class label of \\"negative\\" on 40% of instances. The optimal Bayesian decision strategy (to maximize the number of correct predictions, see ) in such a case is to always predict \\"positive\\" (i.e., predict the majority category in the absence of other information), which has 60% chance of winning rather than matching which has 52% of winning (where p is the probability of positive realization, the result of matching would be p^2+(1-p)^2, here .6 \\\\times .6+ .4 \\\\times .4). The probability-matching strategy is of psychological interest because it is frequently employed by human subjects in decision and classification studies (where it may be related to Thompson sampling). The only case when probability matching will yield same results as Bayesian decision strategy mentioned above is when all class base rates are the same. So, if in the training set positive examples are observed 50% of the time, then the Bayesian strategy would yield 50% accuracy (1 √ó .5), just as probability matching (.5 √ó.5 + .5 √ó .5).

It is nearly identical to the Zastava M85 carbine; the only differences between the two are caliber and, correspondingly, magazine design.History of Zastava Arms - 1992 The M92 is a shortened version of the Zastava M70 assault rifle, which is a modified copy of the Soviet AKM assault rifle. Overview The Zastava M92 chambers and fires the Soviet 7.62√ó39mm round. It is a gas- operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, and selective fire firearm with an under folding metal stock. In general design, it is a modified hybrid of the Soviet AKMSU and AKS-74U carbines, but is easily distinguished by the design of pistol grip and especially by the handguard (which is longer), which is made out of a different wood type and has three cooling vents instead of the usual two. This feature gives the M92 less overheating on full auto mode. The M92 also features a shorter barrel. Unlike most rifle rounds which would otherwise experience a loss of velocity out of a shorter barrel, the 7.62√ó39mm round loses very little velocity when compared to a full length barrel. This makes it an excellent round for short-barrel rifles. The short barrel of the M92 may not lose enough velocity to even make a considerable difference when compared to the M70. Design and features The M92 is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective fire, shoulder-fired weapon with an underfolding stock. In contrast to the M70, the M92 also features a flash eliminator on the barrel end, which reduces muzzle flash and allows the user to see the bullet's point of impact. Like all carbine rifles, the M92 has a shorter effective range and lower penetration when compared to the original rifle, but it also has its own advantages, it is more efficient in close combat, the handling is improved and it has a higher rate of fire. Other advantages of a shorter barrel also gives it more portability and ease of concealment, making it popular for vehicle crews, pilots and special forces.

Using the technique involves zooming while the shutter is open with a relatively slow shutter speed, generally below 1/60 of a second. For this reason low light or small apertures are required. It is also possible to achieve a similar effect with either computer software like Adobe Photoshop (after the photo has been shot) or a photographic filter. In these cases the shutter speed can be as fast as necessary. Photographs taken with this technique are characterized by blurred streaks emanating from the center of the photograph. The effect is nearly identical to a motion blur image in which the camera is traveling towards the subject. For this reason the zoom burst is typically used to create an impression of motion towards the subject.

The film is based on an unproduced script written by French mime, director and actor Jacques Tati in 1956. Controversy surrounds Tati's motivation for the script, which was written as a personal letter to his estranged eldest daughter, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel in collaboration with his long-term writing partner Henri Marquet, between writing for the films Mon Oncle and Play Time.\\"In the Works: A black and white doc about shades of grey\\" by Alison Willmore. 02-21-2007.

Plot In 1959 Paris, an out- of-work illusionist packs his belongings, including an ill-tempered rabbit, and moves to London. Unable to compete with modern entertainment, such as rock and roll, he plies his trade at smaller gatherings in bars, caf√©s, and parties. He accepts the invitation of a drunken party patron to visit a remote Scottish island, where he entertains the locals. Staying in a room above the pub, he meets a girl, Alice, who is captivated by his illusions and kindness, including a gift of red shoes. Alice believes the downtrodden performer possesses genuine magical powers, and follows him to Edinburgh, where he performs at a modest theatre. They share a room in a run-down guest house favoured by other fading performers. The illusionist sleeps on a couch and the girl keeps busy by cleaning and cooking food that she shares with the neighbours. The girl's affections even tame the rabbit, but the illusionist's increasingly meagre wages, spent on gifts for Alice, lead him to pawn his magic kit and secretly take on demeaning jobs. Alice attracts the affection of a handsome young man. After the illusionist sees them walking together, he leaves her with money and a note stating, \\"MAGICIANS DO NOT EXIST\\". He also releases the rabbit on Arthur's Seat, which soon meets other rabbits. As Alice moves in with her boyfriend, the illusionist departs on a train, where he declines an opportunity to perform a magic trick for a child. Production According to the 2006 reading of the script at the London Film School introduced by Chomet, \\"The great French comic Jacques Tati wrote the script of The Illusionist and intended to make it as a live action film with his daughter\\".London Film School (LFS), Scenario 3 , 2005-12-19 Catalogued in the Centre National de la Cin√©matographie archives under the impersonal moniker \\"Film Tati N¬∫ 4\\", the script was passed to Chomet by the caretakers of Tati's oeuvre, J√©r√¥me Deschamps and Macha Make√Øeff after Chomet's previous film The Triplets of Belleville was premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Chomet has said that Tati's youngest daughter, Sophie Tatischeff, had suggested an animated film when Chomet was seeking permission to use a clip from Tati's 1949 film Jour de f√™te as she did not want an actor to play her father. Sophie Tatischeff died on 27 October 2001, almost two years before the 11 June 2003 French release of The Triplets of Belleville. =Animation= The film was made at Chomet's Edinburgh film studio, Django Films, by an international group of animators directed by Paul Dutton, including Sydney Padua, Greg Manwaring and Jacques Muller.IMDB Retrieved 6 November 2018Scots animation?

The Scotsman. 14 June 2010 The film was primarily animated in Scottish Studios in Edinburgh (Django Films) and Dundee (ink.digital), with further animation done in Paris and London. The 2D part of animation sent in Paris has been executed at Neomis Animation studio, where the animation department was directed by Antoine Antin and the clean-up department by Gr√©gory Lecocq. Around 5% of the work (mainly inbetweening and clean-up) was completed in South Korea. Django Films was originally established with the intention to establish itself in the filmmaking scene with both animation and live action, however the company is being dismantled. Django was beset with production difficulties, first losing funding for its first animated feature, Barbacoa. It then failed to secure funding for a BBC project that had been labelled \\"The Scottish Simpsons\\". Chomet was then fired from the directorial duties of The Tale of Despereaux by Gary Ross. Django Films were very far from employing the 250 artists that it would have been required for the project, an estimated figure reported by Scotland on Sunday in 2005.

Now, however, the family of Tati's illegitimate and estranged eldest child, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel, who lives in the north-east of England, are calling for the French director to give her credit as the true inspiration for the film. The script of L'illusionniste, they say, was Tati's response to the shame of having abandoned his first child [Schiel] and it remains the only public recognition of her existence. They accuse Chomet of attempting to airbrush out their painful family legacy again.\\" On 26 May 2010, renowned film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times published a lengthy letter from Jacques Tati's middle grandson, Richard McDonald that pinpointed historical events in the private life of Jacques Tati that the family believe was his remorseful, melancholy inspiration to write, yet never make, L'Illusionniste.

With McDonald being quoted saying \\"My grandmother and all his stage acquaintances during the 1930s/40s always maintained that [Tati] was a great colleague as a friend and artist; he unfortunately just made a massive mistake that because of the time and circumstances he was never able to correctly address.

Mury compared it to the director's previous feature film: \\"This Illusionist is as tender and contemplative as the Triplets were farcical and uneasy. But we find the oblique look, the talent that is particular of Sylvain Chomet. ... This world of yesterday fleets between realism and poetry.\\" Christophe Carri√®re of L'Express was not fully convinced by Chomet's directing, finding the story clever, but \\"blunted when Chomet lets himself be submerged by Tati's melancholy, delivering more of a homage to a master than a personal adaption. Nevertheless, it is otherwise a beautiful work, with impeccable graphics and provides some stunning sequences (based on carnivorous rabbit stew ...).

Tati's biographer, David Bellos, reviewing The Illusionist in Senses of Cinema was highly critical of Chomet's adaptation stating \\"the film is a disaster\\". \\"The great disappointment for me and I think for all viewers is that what Chomet does with the material is‚Ä¶ well, nothing.

Biggs was spotted by the then Tykes Academy boss Stuart Lancaster and was asked to join the Tykes' Academy side. Before the 2004‚Äì05 Zurich Premiership season, Biggs was considering a part-time rugby career with National Division Two team Harrogate, having failed to make an appearance in the Leeds Tykes first team. At the time, he was working in a cinema and in a pea factory to supplement his life as a business student at Leeds Metropolitan University, but by the end of the season he had collected a Powergen Cup winners medal. He had been recalled by Tykes coach Phil Davies on the eve of the season as the club were forced to call on all their resources when faced with an injury crisis with Phil Christophers, Diego Albanese, Tim Stimpson and Iain Balshaw all unable to play. Biggs was included in the pre-season warm up games and was picked in the starting line up for the opening game of the season against Gloucester Rugby on 5 September 2004, making his full debut in a 16‚Äì21 defeat at Headingley. Biggs also featured in the next game against Leicester Tigers, scoring a try in a 20‚Äì42 defeat. He was first to react to a Gordon Ross cross field kick and chipped on ahead of Austin Healey to collect the ball and evade the cover tackle to touch down.

He ended his debut season with a place in the Tykes' Powergen Cup final against Bath Rugby, collecting his first winners medal in a 20‚Äì12 win. He was chosen ahead of Argentine wing Diego Albanese in the Tykes' side for the Twickenham clash. After his first season, he was selected for the England team in the IRB U21s Championship in Argentina and was involved in the U21s‚Äô Six Nations campaign, playing in their final clash with Scotland. He ended last season as the club's top try scorer and was voted Player of the Year. Biggs, who was close to being selected for the England Saxons last summer, committed himself to the Tykes until 2009. He missed three months of the National Division One 2006/7 season, following a shoulder surgery that he suffered in September 2006. He had an operation to repair torn cartilage and a ligament, but returned to action in January 2007 as a replacement against Nottingham. Biggs moved to the Newcastle Falcons on a one-year contract for the 2009‚Äì10 season. He was also called into the England Saxons squad to face Italy A in Ragusa, Sicily on 9 February 2008. On 17 February 2010, it was announced that Biggs had signed a three-year deal to play for Bath. On 10 October 2013, Biggs was set for a cross-code switch to rugby league to join Hull F.C. in the Super League. But on 4 April 2014, Hull F.C. announced they called off the deal to sign Tom Biggs. Instead, Biggs signed for local rivals Worcester Warriors, who compete in the RFU Championship from the 2014-15 season. On 16 October 2017 Biggs announced his retirement from rugby on medical advice.http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/sport/wrfc/15599741.Ex_Warriors_wing_Biggs_retires_following_medical_advice/ Honours *Powergen Cup/Anglo-Welsh Cup titles: 1 **2005 References External links *Bath 1st XV squad profile Living people 1984 births People educated at Hymers College English rugby union players Leeds Tykes players ","title":"Tom Biggs"},{"id":"9732182","text":"In probability and statistics, base rate generally refers to the (base) class probabilities unconditioned on featural evidence, frequently also known as prior probabilities. For example, if it were the case that 1% of the public were \\"medical professionals\\", and 99% of the public were not \\"medical professionals\\", then the base rate of medical professionals is simply 1%. In the sciences, including medicine, the base rate is critical for comparison. It may at first seem impressive that 1,000 people beat their winter cold while using 'Treatment X', until we look at the entire 'Treatment X' population and find that the base rate of success is only 1/100 (i.e. 100,000 people tried the treatment, but the other 99,000 people never really beat their winter cold). The treatment's effectiveness is clearer when such base rate information (i.e. \\"1,000 people... out of how many?\\") is available. Note that controls may likewise offer further information for comparison; maybe the control groups, who were using no treatment at all, had their own base rate success of 5/100. Controls thus indicate that 'Treatment X' makes things worse, despite that initial proud claim about 1,000 people. The normative method for integrating base rates (prior probabilities) and featural evidence (likelihoods) is given by Bayes' rule. The base rate fallacy A large number of psychological studies have examined a phenomenon called base-rate neglect or base rate fallacy in which category base rates are not integrated with featural evidence in the normative manner. Mathematician Keith Devlin provides an illustration of the risks of this: He asks us to imagine that there is a type of cancer that afflicts 1% of all people. A doctor then says there is a test for that cancer which is about 80% reliable. He also says that the test provides a positive result for 100% of people who have the cancer, but it also results in a 'false positive' for 20% of people - who do not have the cancer. Now, if we test positive, we may be tempted to think it is 80% likely that we have the cancer. Devlin explains that, in fact, our odds are less than 5%. What is missing from the jumble of statistics is the most relevant base rate information. We should ask the doctor, \\"Out of the number of people who test positive (this is the base rate group that we care about), how many have the cancer?\\"http://www.edge.org/responses/what-scientific- concept-would-improve-everybodys-cognitive-toolkit In assessing the probability that a given individual is a member of a particular class, we must account for other information besides the base rate. In particular, we must account for featural evidence. For example, when we see a person wearing a white doctor's coat and stethoscope, and prescribing medication, we have evidence which may allow us to conclude that the probability of this particular individual being a \\"medical professional\\" is considerably greater than the category base rate of 1%.

This ctenophore differs from all previously described lobate ctenophores in two major ways: (1) all of the meridional canals have blind aboral endings, and (2) the body is penetrated by a deep notch located between the adjacent subtentacular comb rows at the level of the infundibulum. This mesopelagic jelly ranges in color from deep red, purple, or black to pale purple. The deep color of its belly may mask the animal's bioluminescence to hide it from potential predators.

Biological Exuberance cites numerous studies on more than 450 species (see List of animals displaying homosexual behavior) showing that homosexual and bisexual behaviors are common among animals and proposes a theory of sexual behavior in which reproduction is only one of its principal biological functions.

He also argues that the implications for humans of homosexual behaviour across the animal kingdom are \\"enormous.\\" His book on homosexuality in animals was cited by the American Psychiatric Association and other groups in their amici curiae brief to the United States Supreme Court in Lawrence v.

It is a \\"\\" opening that can be used against virtually any black defence and thus comprises a smaller body of opening theory than many other openings.

Historically it developed into > a system mainly from three variations: *1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4 *1.d4 Nf6 > 2.Nf3 e6 3.Bf4 *1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Bf4 The corresponding Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings codes are D02, A46, and A48. If White is going to play the London System, it is now thought to be more accurate to play 2.Bf4 instead of 2.Nf3 and 3.Bf4. Description The line came into fashion in the 1922 London tournament as a way of meeting hypermodern setups. The line gives White a position, and critics of the line refer to it as the \\"old man‚Äôs variation\\" or the \\"boring system\\". Even so, the opening can lead to attacks. Vlatko Kovaƒçeviƒá and David Bronstein are among the sharp tactical players who have played the London System. Early play =1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4= This position can also be reached via 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Bf4. Black usually plays either 3...c5, 3...e6, 3...Bf5, 3...c6, 3...g6, or 3...Nc6. =1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.Bf4= Black usually plays either 3...b6, 3...c5, or 3...d5, transposing above. =1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Bf4= Play often goes 3...Bg7 4.e3 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.0-0. As is usual in the King's Indian, Black can strike in the centre with ...c5 or ...e5. After 6...c5 7.c3, Black often plays either 7...b6, 7...Qb6, 7...Nc6, 7...Be6, or 7...cxd4. Black can prepare ...e5 in a number of ways, usually starting with either 6...Nbd7, 6...Nc6, or 6...Nfd7. Afterwards, if unimpeded by Black's moves, White ideally would like to build a pyramid of pawns centered on d4 and develop all minor pieces. This could be achieved in various orders, for example, 1.d4, 2.Bf4, 3.Nf3, 4.e3, 5.c3, 6.Nbd2, 7.Bd3.

The series, which was principally filmed in and around Patterdale and The Ullswater Hotel, Glenridding, stars John Simm as Danny Kavanagh, a hotel porter, compulsive gambler, and philanderer who escapes from the dole queues in Liverpool to live in the Lake District. After he meets and marries local girl Emma Quinlan (Emma Cunniffe), they move back to Liverpool. However, the consequences of Danny's gambling habit results in Emma moving back to the Lakes. Months later, Danny also returns, and takes up a job looking after a rowing boat concession, and starts to patch up his relationship with Emma. Two series were broadcast. The first, made of four episodes including a feature- length pilot, aired during September and October 1997. A second series, extended to ten episodes, broadcast from January to March 1999. McGovern described the series as \\"partially autobiographical\\", having also been a gambling addict and having met his wife Eileen while working at a hotel in Cumbria. McGovern's involvement in the second series was heavily reduced, with a number of co-writers contributing to the series, including Joe Ainsworth, William Gaminara and Julie Rutterford. The series was critically acclaimed when first broadcast, although it caused controversy due to the hard-hitting portrayal of an immoral British sub-culture, and scenes of sex and violence. The series was considered a springboard for many members of the cast, including Kaye Wragg, James Thornton, Kevin Doyle and Elizabeth Berrington. Merchandise The complete series was released as a four-disc box set by Second Sight Media on 6 October 2003. The set contains additional commentaries for the first series by John Simm and director David Blair. The box set was re-issued on 16 April 2012, however both the original and re-issue are now out of print. Region 4 DVD released rated the series R16 for offensive language and scenes of a sexual nature. A novelisation of the first series by Kate Lock (credited as K.M. Lock) was released on 4 September 1997, ten days prior to the broadcast of the first episode.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jimmy-Mcgoverns- Lakes-Kate-Lock/ A soundtrack to the series was also issued on CD and Cassette in 1997, containing contributions from the likes of Blur, Cast, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Manic Street Preachers, Supergrass and Radiohead. Plot One of the principal filming locations for the series, the Inn on the Lake Hotel =Series 1 (1997)= After leaving the Lakes to move to Liverpool, Emma (Emma Cunniffe) decides to return home after her husband Danny's gambling addiction begins to grow progressively stronger. Months later, Danny follows her and takes up a job looking after a rowing boat concession. Meanwhile, he is forced to reject the unsubtle advances of the attention-seeking Lucy Archer (Kaye Wragg), who unable to take the pain of rejection, becomes determined to take out revenge. When three schoolgirls drown in a boating accident whilst Danny is on duty at work, he is unwilling to tell the truth, having been distracted by betting over the telephone - despite promising Emma that he would stop gambling. As the community looks for someone to blame, Lucy lies to the police to implicate him. =Series 2 (1999)= When Lucy is raped by three locals, only Danny, enduring the claustrophobic hostility of the Quinlan family home, can testify as a witness - which puts him at odds with the village, his wife and her family.

S√∂dra/Norra Benickebrinken are two sloping streets in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden, stretching from √ñsterl√•nggatan up to Svartmangatan. Etymology View from the south. The present name is derived from a J√∂ren Benick, a man who had a tavern here named Solen (\\"The Sun\\") after the sign hanging in the street. The tavern was located in a block demolished at the end of the 19th century and located on the eastern side of the then extremely narrow slopes. It was later taken over by J√∂ren's grandsons, both mentioned as the city's official innkeepers in the beginning of the 17th century. The slopes were originally named Svartbr√∂drabrinken and Svartmunkabrinken (\\"Black Brother's/Monk's Slope\\") after the Black Friars' Monastery located on the western side of the southern slope until the Reformation (1520‚Äì1530). The monastery was built on land given to the Dominicans following the coronation of King Magnus Eriksson (1316‚Äì1377) in 1336. A cellar from the monastery, which served as a lodging and still contains the original stoves, is found under the present building at number 4. A pattern of sets in the street Pr√§stgatan still shows the extent of the monastery walls, and human bones discovered during an archaeological excavation in 1993 showed the graveyard of the monastery extended well into the northern part of the present southern slope. History Benickebrinken from north. Before King Sigismund's (1566‚Äì1632) arrival in Stockholm in 1593, a large number of lodgings and taverns across the city were urged to undertake improvements. To guide foreign guests, the taverns were requested to put signs in the streets displaying symbols \\"like is the manner abroad\\". By the early 17th century, however, the number of taverns and lodging houses had not kept pace with demand, so the mayor reintroduced an ordinance stipulating two inns in every block. Shortly thereafter the Benicke tavern together with five other taverns were given a charter, recording that the premises to be used exclusively for the purpose ‚Äî \\"all wine, beer, and other foreign beverages be sold and tapped\\" (all wijn, √∂√∂ll och andra fremmande drycker selias och upptappas). In various contemporary sources, the house of Benicke not only gradually gave its name to the slopes, but was also used as a point of reference. In 1564, a house was said to be located \\"by Blackfriars slope right across J√∂renn Beneke's house\\" (wiid Swartmunka brincken twerth vt√∂ffver J√∂renn Benekes huss). In 1605, a house offered for sale was said to be located \\"in J√∂renn Benichson's slope, on the north side of J√∂renn Benichsons house\\" (i J√∂ren Benichsons brinck, p√• n√∂rre sidhenn om J√∂renn Benichsons hus), and his name appears again in 1622 when another building is put up for sale. Finally, on a map dated 1733 the slopes were labelled with their present names (Nor och S√∂der Benike Brincken). The Salvation Army opened a pantry on Number 2 in 1891 and a night refuge for homeless men the following year, both institutions remained in operation until the 1970s. Today the building is used as a board- and-lodging accommodation for alcoholics. Public toilets were installed under the slope in 2005‚Äì2006.

History Spanning nearly of pine forest, rice fields and cypress swamps, Mansfield Plantation was once one of the largest rice producing plantation in the country. Mansfield, along with adjacent rice plantations up and down the Black River, provided much of Europe with \\"Carolina Gold\\" rice during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Rice growing was made possible by: # perfecting irrigation techniques using tidal water and manmade dykes. # experimentation with natural fertilizers. # most notably, African-American slave labor. After the American Civil War, rice production became too expensive and soon the plantations fell into bankruptcy and were sold off to new owners. Present day Today, Mansfield Plantation is preserved as an authentic rice plantation, complete with the original plantation home, a school house, live oak avenue (\\"oak all√©e\\"), chapel, guest house, and grounds. It also has the only remaining winnowing barn in Georgetown County, where rice grains were processed for shipment. =Restoration= Undergoing restoration is a slave village of 7 slave cabins and a chapel.Slave cabin/chapel restoration project In 2009, the entire plantation underwent a privately funded, massive restoration project to keep its distinct history alive for generations to come. It is said to be the only American plantation saved from development and reclaimed by a direct descendant of the original owners. =Media= Mansfield Plantation has been featured in numerous films, documentaries and television shows. It served as the backdrop for scenes from Mel Gibson's 2000 film, The Patriot.

He was born into a family with at least five ordained ministers, including his father, Monty, a founding member of the Jordanaires. When Matthews was in high school in Lamar, Mo., he sang in a quartet called The Zionaires, which was also founded by his father. This quartet performed regionally and sang in quartet competitions. Other members of the group included Noel Scott, baritone; Spike (Carl) Bickel, tenor; and Dan Fields, bass. Matthews briefly attended Ozark Bible College in Joplin, Mo. During this time he joined Noel Scott and Charlene Munger in the developing movement of Christian folk music. This experience helped Matthews to choose a less traditional path to ministry. After leaving college, he founded a coffee house ministry in Cincinnati with the purpose of promoting social activities among Christians and providing a safe haven for street people. In 1971 Matthews was signed as the first contemporary Christian artist to record for Word Records, a gospel label which had, up to that point, released spoken word recordings and albums of traditional gospel music. His first album was Wish We'd All Been Ready. With the release of his second album, All I Am Is What You See, Word launched a new label called Myrrh Records, created specifically to tap into the musical interests of the burgeoning Jesus movement. Matthews' music and concert style has always pushed the envelope. In 1974, Matthews was invited to perform at The Jesus Festival, a Woodstock type event in which attenders camped out and listened to Christian music and Bible teaching for three days. When Matthews' band took the stage, the promoters and many in the crowd were shocked at their rock and roll presentation; up to this point most contemporary Christian music was more influenced by folk than rock. Matthews' band was unplugged by the promoters and chased off the stage by the concert- goers. Matthews referenced this experience on his fourth album, 1975's Eyes to the Sky, with a song called Pennsylvania song: \\"you pulled the plug and drained my soul, but I know I left a ring around the tub of tradition, I saw some dance and sing\\" and again in his ninth solo album, titled Plugged In. Matthews is currently working under the stage name Red Beard, performing frequently at the Trade Winds Resort in St. Petersburg Beach, Florida and the Palm Island Resort. He recently released an album of pirate songs and tall tales called Red Beard Pirate King. In 2015 Son of Dust was remastered by Bim Ingersoll at Rockroach Studio, and independently released on CD by Stowaway Music. This was the first time any of Matthews albums from the 1970s was available on CD. Discography * Wish We'd All Been Ready (1971) * All I Am Is What You See...

The books take their name from Self- Help, an 1859 best-seller by Samuel Smiles, but are also known and classified under \\"self-improvement\\", a term that is a modernized version of self-help. Self-help books moved from a niche position to being a postmodern cultural phenomenon in the late twentieth century.Micki McGee, Self-help, Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life (Oxford 2005) p. 11 Early history Informal guides to everyday behaviour might be said to have existed almost as long as writing itself. Ancient Egyptian \\"Codes\\" of conduct \\"have a curiously modern note: 'you trail from street to street, smelling of beer...like a broken rudder, good for nothing....you have been found performing acrobatics on a wall!.A. Rosalie David, The Egyptian Kingdoms (Oxford 1973) p. 113 Micki McGee writes: \\"Some social observers have suggested that the Bible is perhaps the first and most significant of self-help books\\".McGee, p. 5 In classical Rome, Cicero's On Friendship and On Duties became \\"handbooks and guides...through the centuries\\",H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Latin Literature (London 1967) p. 184-5 and Ovid wrote Art of Love and Remedy of Love. The former has been described as \\"the best sex book, as valid for San Francisco and London as for ancient Rome\\", dealing \\"with practical problems of everyday life: where to go to meet girls, how to start a conversation with them, how to keep them interested, and...how to be sociable rather than athletic in bed\\";Eric Berne, Sex in Human Loving (Penguin 1970) p. 226 the latter has been described as containing \\"a series of instructions, as frank as they are ingenious and brilliantly expressed, on falling out of love\\".Rose, p. 330 Many Islamic scholars write books that could be could be categorized as self-help books, one prominent example is Al-Ghazali who wrote Ay farzand (O son!) which is a short book of counsel that al-Ghazali wrote for one of his students. The book was early translated to Arabic entitled ayyuhal walad. Another is Disciplining the Soul, which is one of the key sections of The Revival of the Religious Sciences. During renaissance, a line of descent may be traced back from Smiles' Self-Help to when \\"the Renaissance concern with self-fashioning produced a flood of educational and self-help materials\\":Frank Whigham/Wayne A. Rebhorn eds., The Art of English Poesie (New York 2007) p. 33 thus \\"the Florentine Giovanni della Casa in his book of manners published in 1558 suggests: 'It is also an unpleasant habit to lift another person's wine or his food to your nose and smell it.Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (Penguin 1971) p. 71 The Middle Ages saw the genre personified in \\"Conduir-amour\\" (\\"guide in love matters\\").C. G. Jung ed., Man and his Symbols (London 1978) p. 196 The postmodern phenomenon It is however in the last half-century or so that the humble self-help book has jumped to cultural prominence, a fact admitted by both the advocates and the critics ‚Äì often highly polarised ‚Äì of the self-improvement genre. Some would 'view the buying of such books...as an exercise in self-education'. Others, more critical, still concede that 'it is too prevalent and powerful a phenomenon to overlook, despite belonging to \\"pop\\" culture'.Steven Starker, in Dolby, p. 57 For better or worse, it is clear that self-help books have had 'a very important role in developing social concepts of disease in the twentieth century', and that they 'disseminate these concepts through the general public so that ordinary people acquire a language for describing some of the complex and ineffable features of emotional and behavioral life'.Lennard J. Davis, Obsession: A History (London 2008) p. 172-3 Where traditional psychology and psychotherapy will tend to be written in an impersonal, objective mode, many self-help books 'involve a first-person involvement and often a conversion experience':Davis, p. 173 in keeping with the self-help support groups on which they often draw, horizontal peer-support and validation is thus offered the reader, as well as advice \\"from above\\". Yet arguably with the movement from the self-help group to the individual \\"self-improvement\\" reader something of that peer support has been lost, reflecting the broader way that 'over the course of the last three decades of the twentieth-century, there has been a significant shift in the meaning of \\"self-help\\"'.McGee, p. 18 A collective enterprise has become a refashioning of the individual self: 'in less than thirty years, \\"self-help\\" ‚Äì once synonymous with mutual aid ‚Äì has come to be understood...as a largely individual undertaking'.McGee, p. 19 Behind the self-help book explosion 'What social theorists call \\"detraditionalization\\" ‚Äì the tendency of advancing capitalism to disrupt the cultures and traditions that may stand in the way of the accumulation of profit'McGee, p. 76 has been seen as underpinning behind the self-help phenomenon in two (overlapping) ways. The first is the eclipse of the informal, communitarian transmission of folkways and folk wisdom: 'the charge that when self-help writers are being simplistic and repetitious, they are also being banal and unoriginal, merely offering their readers platitudes...on behalf of the best parts of folk wisdom',Dolby, p. 63-4 may simply be because they are providing a formal conduit for the conveyance of such \\"home truths\\" in an increasingly unstructured and anomic world. The other result of the loss of 'Weber's \\"traditional behavior...everyday action to which people have become habitually accustomed\\"'Alfred Schutz, The Phenomenology of the Social World (Illinois 1997) p. 197 is an increased social pressure for Self-fashioning: 'while one's identity might have been formerly anchored in (and limited by) a community...the self-creating self must create a written narrative of his or her life'.McGee, p. 157 self-help books 'written and read for the purpose of helping people build a personal philosophy'Dolby, p. 79 contribute to that end. The danger may arise however of an overestimation of the possibilities of change, given that 'we do not in any meaningful sense intend or choose our birth, our parents, our bodies, our language, our culture, our thoughts, our dreams, our desires, our death, and so on'.Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (London 1994) p. 9 In the PsyBlog- Understand Your Mind , Dr. Jeremy Dean states that \\"the dark side of hope is that claims about potential improvement can, and are, grossly exaggerated, in order to prise open our wallets. Similarly a bright and breezy approach to potential change may lead us to believe that changing ourselves is easy, when often it requires considerable, sometimes monumental, effort\\".Jeremy Dean, \\"Is Modern Self-Help Just a Massive Money-Making Scam?\\", PsyBlog-Understand Your Mind, 2008. Retrieved 12 April 2015. The 'Twelve-step \\"Traditions\\"...have fostered a notion of individual self-mastery or self-control as limited...use of the Serenity Prayer encourages individuals to accept what they cannot change, to find courage to change what they can change, and to seek wisdom in discerning the difference'.McGee, p. 186 and p. 240 Self-help books will indeed often acknowledge formally that 'this book does not replace the need for therapy and counselling for troubled relationships or survivors of a dysfunctional family'.John Gray, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus (London 1993) p. 7 In practice however, fueled by competitive advertising, often 'such books hold out to the reader the promise of a virtually \\"instantaneous\\" transformation';Mel D.Faber, New Age Thinking (Ottawa 1996) p. 350 and there ensues something of a 'built-in contradiction of the celebratory arc of the self-help book combined with the stubborn realities'Davis, p. 231-2 of the human world. The reader may go away disillusioned; or may seek for the answer in the next book, so that 'self-help books can become an addiction in and of themselves'J. and L. Fried, Adult Children (1988) p. vii ‚Äì a process that will 'have fostered the belabored self'McGee, p. 176 rather than relieving it. In that perspective, since all self-help books 'have at least one common message. They tell you that you have the power to change yourself....By implication all of these books are saying, if you are in pain, if you are stuck and can't seem to change, it's no one's fault but your own'.P. R. McGraw, It's Not Your Fault (2004) p. 5 It is important to note that the popularity of self-help books may cause a placebo effect and thus appear to be an effective way to change an individual's way of thinking about their life and selves. This is because individuals will believe these books will change their lives like others have endorsed. Characteristics Self- help books often focus on popular psychology such as romantic relationships, or aspects of the mind and human behavior which believers in self-help feel can be controlled with effort. Self-help books typically advertise themselves as being able to increase self-awareness and performance, including satisfaction with one's life. They often say that they can help you achieve this more quickly than with conventional therapies. Many celebrities have marketed self-help books including Jennifer Love Hewitt, Oprah Winfrey, Elizabeth Taylor, Charlie Fitzmaurice, Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra and Cher. Like most books, self-help books can be purchased both offline and online; 'between 1972 and 2000, the numbers of self-help books...increased from 1.1 percent to 2.4 percent of the total number of books in print'.McGee, p. 200 Fictional analogues Stephen Potter's \\"Upmanship\\" books are satirical takes on status-seeking under the cloak of sociableness ‚Äì 'remember, that it is just on such occasions that an appearance of geniality is most important'Stephen Potter, Some Notes on Lifemanship (London 1950) p. 32 ‚Äì cast in advice-book form. A few decades later, with the neoliberal turn, such advice ‚Äì 'Remember the reality of self-interest'Robert J. Ringer, in McGee, p. 55 ‚Äì would be being seriously advocated in the self-help world: in bestsellers like Swim with the Sharks, all 'kinds of seemingly benign guile are encouraged', on the principle that 'status displays matter: just don't be suckered by them yourself'.McGee, p. 74 Perhaps the best-known fictional embodiment of the world of the self-help book is Bridget Jones. Taking 'self- help books...[as] a new form of religion'Helen Fielding Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (Picador 2000) p. 75 ‚Äì 'a kind of secularised religion ‚Äì a sort of moral values lite'McGee, p. 20 ‚Äì she struggles to integrate its often conflicting instructions into a coherent whole. 'She must stop beating herself over the head with Women Who Love Too Much and instead think more towards Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus...see Richard's behaviour less as a sign that she is co-dependent and loving too much and more in the light of him being like a Martian rubber band'.Helen Fielding, Bridget Jones's Diary (London 1997) p. 21 Even she, however, has the occasional crisis of faith, when she wonders: 'Maybe it helps if you've never read a self-help book in your life'.Fielding, Diary p. 60 In the BookWorld Companion, it is suggested that 'those of you who have tired of the glitzy world of shopping and inappropriate boyfriends in Chicklit, a trip to Dubious Lifestyle Advice might be the next step.

On defense in American football, rushing is charging across the line of scrimmage towards the quarterback or kicker in the effort to stop or \\"sack\\" them. The purpose is tackling, hurrying or flushing the quarterback, or blocking or disrupting a kick. In both college and professional football, getting a strong pass rush is an important skill, as even an average quarterback can be productive if he has enough time to find an open receiver, even against a good secondary. To increase pressure, teams will sometimes use a pass-rushing specialist, who is usually a quick defensive end or outside linebacker tasked with aggressively rushing the quarterback in obvious passing situations. One of the most effective methods of rushing the passer is by using a stunt or twist, which is when defensive players quickly change positions at the snap of the ball and engage a different blocker than the offense expected, Defenses typically task three or four defensive lineman to rush the passer on most plays, but most will occasionally increase pressure by blitzing one or more non-lineman at the quarterback when a pass play in anticipated. A pass rush can be effective even if it does not sack the quarterback if it forces the passer to get rid of the ball before he wanted to, resulting in an incomplete pass or interception. To attack a strong pass rush, offenses can throw quicker short passes or run draw plays or screen passes, which are design to lure defenders into the offensive backfield and then quickly get a ball carrier behind them.

Biography  He participated in the resistance to German occupation in the Second World War, and was one of the founding members of the Jersey Democratic Movement, a communist party, which by the end of the war in 1945 had grown to 18. The JDM helped to provide support, information and sustenance to the slave workers brought by the Germans over to Jersey from Russia. In 1966, Le Brocq and 19 other islanders were awarded gold watches by the Soviet Union as a sign of gratitude for their role in the resistance movement. He was a campaigner for working-class rights in the field of housing and social policy, and the Communist Party‚Äôs leading figure in the Islands. After unsuccessful bids for election in the 1960s, he was elected to the States of Jersey in 1966, which was such a remarkable event that it was noted in the British press ‚Äì \\"Working man joins the rulers of Jersey\\" (Observer 18.12.1966).

O'Donnell was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He studied law at the University of Buenos Aires and became a lawyer in 1958, aged 22. He was involved in student politics, and was Secretary and Acting President of the Buenos Aires University Federation (FUBA), part of the Argentine University Federation, in 1954‚Äì1955. Later he served as national Vice-Minister of Interior (Political Affairs), in Argentina, in 1963. But he focused mainly on making a living by working as a lawyer and teaching. During these years he taught in the School of Law at the University of Buenos Aires (1958‚Äì66) and at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (1966‚Äì68).{{cndate=January 2020} In 1968 O'Donnell left Argentina to pursue graduate studies in political science at Yale University. He earned his master's degree in political science in 1971, but rather than complete his dissertation and take a job offer from Harvard University, he returned to Buenos Aires. The text he started to work on at Yale was published as Modernization and Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism (1973),Guillermo O‚ÄôDonnell, Modernization and Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism: Studies in South American Politics (Institute of International Studies/University of California, 1973). a book that immediately drew a lot of attention and led to a seminal debate about Latin American politics in David Collier's edited volume, The New Authoritarianism in Latin America (1979).David Collier (ed.), The New Authoritarianism in Latin America (Princeton University Press, 1979). But since this text was published, it could not be presented as a dissertation. And thus O'Donnell would not receive his Ph.D in political science from Yale University until he presented a new dissertation and thus was awarded his Ph.D. belatedly, once he was an established scholar and professor, in 1987.The work that earned O'Donnell his Ph.D. was 1966-1973. El Estado burocr√°tico autoritario. Triunfos, derrotas y crisis (Editorial Belgrano, 1982); later published in English as Bureaucratic Authoritarianism. Argentina, 1966-1973, in Comparative Perspective (University of California Press, 1988). In Argentina, O'Donnell initially taught at the Universidad del Salvador (1972‚Äì75) and was a researcher at the Centro de Investigaciones en Administraci√≥n P√∫blica (CIAP), at the Torcuato di Tella Institute, between 1971 and 1975. Subsequently, O'Donnell was a founding member of CEDES (Centro de Estudios de Estado y Sociedad), where he worked from 1975 until 1979. During this period, Argentina was increasingly swept by violence, as guerrilla organizations such as the Montoneros sought to undermine the government and eventually the military rulers came to power in 1976 and launched a dirty war. In this climate, CEDES was one of the few research centers where critical thinking about politics thrived. Indeed, in 1978, O'Donnell launched a major research project on democratic transitions in Southern Europe and Latin America that he co-directed with Philippe C. Schmitter and that was sponsored by the Latin American Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in Washington, D.C. The project began with three conferences, in 1979, 1980, and 1981, that gathered many of the world‚Äôs most distinguished scholars of democracy, including Robert A. Dahl, Juan Linz, Adam Przeworski, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Albert Otto Hirschman. It would result in a landmark publication: Transitions from Authoritarian Rule. Prospects for Democracy (1986).Guillermo O‚ÄôDonnell, Philippe Schmitter and Laurence Whitehead (eds.), Transitions from Authoritarian Rule. Prospects for Democracy 4 Vols. (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986). In late 1979, O'Donnell left Argentina again, this time for Brazil. He worked as a researcher at IUPERJ (Instituto Universit√°rio de Pesquisas do R√≠o de Janeiro) (1980‚Äì82) and then moved to the research center CEBRAP (Centro Brasileiro de An√°lise e Planejamento) in S√£o Paulo in 1982, replacing the sociologist Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who had become a national Senator. But O'Donnell moved again, now from Brazil to the United States, in 1983. Thereafter, though he maintained his affiliation with CEBRAP until 1991, he taught at the University of Notre Dame from 1983 until 2009, where he was Helen Kellogg Professor of Government and International Studies. He was also academic director of the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies of the University of Notre Dame from 1983 until 1997. His twenty-six year association with Notre Dame made this university the most important institutional home of O'Donnell's career.{{cndate=January 2020} During his career, O'Donnell played a leadership role in many professional associations. He served as president of the International Political Science Association (IPSA) from 1988 to 1991, and was vice-president of the American Political Science Association (APSA) in 1999‚Äì2000. He also held many short term appointment at universities around the world. He was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1973-74; the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLASCO), in Buenos Aires, in 1978-79; the University of California, Berkeley, in 1982; the Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Ciencias Sociales, at the Instituto Juan March, in Madrid, in 1997; the University of Cambridge, where he was the Simon Bolivar Distinguished Visiting Professor in 2002-03; and the University of Oxford, where he was Senior Visiting Fellow in Politics at Nuffield College in 2003-04 and John G. Winant Visiting Professorship of American Government in 2007-08. He also was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, in Stanford, California, in 2002.{{cndate=January 2020} O'Donnell also bridged the worlds of academia and politics. He worked with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) during the 2000s, collaborating with Dante Caputo in the preparation of the United Nations Development Programme‚Äôs (UNDP) report Democracy in Latin America. Toward a Citizens‚Äô Democracy (2004),United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Democracy in Latin America. Toward a Citizens‚Äô Democracy (New York and Buenos Aires: UNDP and Aguilar, Altea, Taurus, Alfaguara, 2004). and a follow-up text, Democracia/Estado/Ciudadan√≠a. Hacia un Estado de y para la democracia en Am√©rica Latina (2008).Programa de Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD), Democracia/Estado/Ciudadan√≠a. Hacia un Estado de y para la democracia en Am√©rica Latina (New York: PNUD, 2008). O'Donnell also was a member of the Advisory Board of the United Nations Democracy Fund and a member of the scientific committee of Fundaci√≥n IDEAS, Spain's Socialist Party's think- tank.Fundacion Ideas O'Donnell returned to his native Buenos Aires in 2009. There he continued to be active on the local academic scene. He joined the Escuela de Pol√≠tica y Gobierno, at the National University of General San Mart√≠n (Universidad Nacional de San Mart√≠n [UNSAM[), his last professional affiliation. At UNSAM O'Donnell founded the Centro de Investigaciones sobre el Estado y la Democracia en Am√©rica Latina (CIEDAL), in 2010.Historia de la UNSAM In 2011 O'Donnell was struck by cancer and, after a four month battle, he died on November 29, 2011, at the age of 75.\\"Notre Dame Political Scientist Guillermo O‚ÄôDonnell Dies\\" A public wake was held in the legislative building of the City of Buenos Aires,\\"Muri√≥ Guillermo O'Donnell\\" and his remains were buried in the Recoleta Cemetery.{{cndate=January 2020} Academic research O‚ÄôDonnell was a theorist of authoritarianism and democratization. O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs Modernization and Bureaucratic Authoritarianism (1973) offered a pioneering analysis of the breakdown of democracies in South America in the 1960s. He argued that the form of authoritarianism experienced by South America starting in the 1960s was novel because it was based on modern technocrats and a professionalized military organization, instead of populist politicians or traditional military strongmen. To capture this distinctiveness, he coined the term 'bureaucratic authoritarianism'. O‚ÄôDonnell argued that this new form of authoritarianism emerged as the result of political conflict generated by an import-substitution model of industrialization. He cast his argument as an alternative to the thesis, advanced most notably by Seymour Martin Lipset,Seymour Martin Lipset, \\"Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy,\\" American Political Science Review Vol. 53, N¬∫ 1 (1959): 69‚Äì105. that industrialization produced democracy. In South America, O‚ÄôDonnell argued, industrialization generated not democracy, but bureaucratic authoritarianism. This work, along with a series of subsequent articles, triggered an important debate in comparative politics and Latin American Studies about the political consequences of economic development. The central contributions to this debate were published in a volume edited by David Collier, The New Authoritarianism in Latin America (1979),David Collier (ed.), The New Authoritarianism in Latin America (Princeton University Press, 1979). which assessed and critiqued O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs thesis. The next phase of O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs research focused on the demise of authoritarianism and transitions to democracy. His coauthored book with Philippe C. Schmitter, Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Tentative Conclusions about Uncertain Democracies (1986), was one of the most widely read and influential works in comparative politics during the 1980s and 1990s. O‚ÄôDonnell and Schmitter proposed a strategic choice approach to transitions to democracy that highlighted how they were driven by the decisions of different actors in response to a core set of dilemmas. The analysis centered on the interaction among four actors: the hard-liners and soft-liners who belonged to the incumbent authoritarian regime, and the moderate and radical oppositions against the regime. This book not only became the point of reference for a burgeoning academic literature on democratic transitions, it was also read widely by political activists engaged in actual struggles to achieve democracy.Gerardo L. Munck, ‚ÄúDemocratic Theory After Transitions From Authoritarian Rule,‚Äù Perspectives on Politics Vol. 9, N¬∫ 2 (2011): 333-43. O'Donnell's research since the early 1990s explored the question of the quality of democracy. His work warns against teleological thinking, that is, the tendency to see countries that democratized in the 1970s and 1980s as following in the tracks, though several steps behind, of the longstanding democratic countries of the West. To highlight the specificity of contemporary Latin American countries and the deficiencies of their democracies, he proposed the concept of delegative democracy, a form of democratic rule that concentrated power in the hands of elected presidents, and the associated concept of horizontal accountability. Later work centered on the problems faced by most Latin American democracies as a result of deficiencies in the rule of law and the social capabilities of citizens. His key works on the quality of democracy have been published in Counterpoints (1999), The Quality of Democracy (2004), Dissonances (2007), and in his final book, Democracy, Agency, and the State (2010), which makes a case for addressing the importance of the state in conceptualizations of democracy. Summing up his contributions, one observer states that \\"O‚ÄôDonnell decisively shaped the intellectual agenda for the study of the rise of military dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the early 1970s; pioneered the analysis of authoritarian breakdowns and democratic transitions throughout the 1980s; and broke new conceptual ground for efforts to understand the problems of life after transition (including the issue of institutional quality) during the 1990s.\\"Sebasti√°n L.

A broad concept, internal control involves everything that controls risks to an organization. It is a means by which an organization's resources are directed, monitored, and measured. It plays an important role in detecting and preventing fraud and protecting the organization's resources, both physical (e.g., machinery and property) and intangible (e.g., reputation or intellectual property such as trademarks). At the organizational level, internal control objectives relate to the reliability of financial reporting, timely feedback on the achievement of operational or strategic goals, and compliance with laws and regulations. At the specific transaction level, internal controls refers to the actions taken to achieve a specific objective (e.g., how to ensure the organization's payments to third parties are for valid services rendered.) Internal control procedures reduce process variation, leading to more predictable outcomes. Internal control is a key element of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 and the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act of 2002, which required improvements in internal control in United States public corporations. Internal controls within business entities are also referred to as operational controls. The main controls in place are sometimes referred to as \\"key financial controls\\" (KFCs).Barnet Council, Key Financial Controls, published March 2016, accessed 29 January 2020 Early history of internal control Internal controls have existed from ancient times. In Hellenistic Egypt there was a dual administration, with one set of bureaucrats charged with collecting taxes and another with supervising them. In the Republic of China, the Supervising Authority (Ê£ÄÂØüÈô¢; pinyin: Ji«énch√° Y√πan), one of the five branches of government, is an investigatory agency that monitors the other branches of government. Definitions There are many definitions of internal control, as it affects the various constituencies (stakeholders) of an organization in various ways and at different levels of aggregation. Under the COSO Internal Control- Integrated Framework, a widely used framework in not only the United States but around the world, internal control is broadly defined as a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. COSO defines internal control as having five components: # Control Environment-sets the tone for the organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the foundation for all other components of internal control. # Risk Assessment-the identification and analysis of relevant risks to the achievement of objectives, forming a basis for how the risks should be managed # Information and Communication-systems or processes that support the identification, capture, and exchange of information in a form and time frame that enable people to carry out their responsibilities # Control Activities- the policies and procedures that help ensure management directives are carried out. # Monitoring-processes used to assess the quality of internal control performance over time. The COSO definition relates to the aggregate control system of the organization, which is composed of many individual control procedures. Discrete control procedures, or controls are defined by the SEC as: \\"...a specific set of policies, procedures, and activities designed to meet an objective. A control may exist within a designated function or activity in a process. A control‚Äôs impact ... may be entity-wide or specific to an account balance, class of transactions or application. Controls have unique characteristics ‚Äì for example, they can be: automated or manual; reconciliations; segregation of duties; review and approval authorizations; safeguarding and accountability of assets; preventing or detecting error or fraud. Controls within a process may consist of financial reporting controls and operational controls (that is, those designed to achieve operational objectives).\\" Context More generally, setting objectives, budgets, plans and other expectations establish criteria for control. Control itself exists to keep performance or a state of affairs within what is expected, allowed or accepted. Control built within a process is internal in nature. It takes place with a combination of interrelated components ‚Äì such as social environment effecting behavior of employees, information necessary in control, and policies and procedures. Internal control structure is a plan determining how internal control consists of these elements.Matti Mattila: The ECAR Model The concepts of corporate governance also heavily rely on the necessity of internal controls. Internal controls help ensure that processes operate as designed and that risk responses (risk treatments) in risk management are carried out (COSO II). In addition, there needs to be in place circumstances ensuring that the aforementioned procedures will be performed as intended: right attitudes, integrity and competence, and monitoring by managers. Roles and responsibilities in internal control According to the COSO Framework, everyone in an organization has responsibility for internal control to some extent. Virtually all employees produce information used in the internal control system or take other actions needed to affect control. Also, all personnel should be responsible for communicating upward problems in operations, non-compliance with the code of conduct, or other policy violations or illegal actions. Each major entity in corporate governance has a particular role to play: =Management= The Chief Executive Officer (the top manager) of the organization has overall responsibility for designing and implementing effective internal control. More than any other individual, the chief executive sets the \\"tone at the top\\" that affects integrity and ethics and other factors of a positive control environment. In a large company, the chief executive fulfills this duty by providing leadership and direction to senior managers and reviewing the way they're controlling the business. Senior managers, in turn, assign responsibility for establishment of more specific internal control policies and procedures to personnel responsible for the unit's functions. In a smaller entity, the influence of the chief executive, often an owner-manager, is usually more direct. In any event, in a cascading responsibility, a manager is effectively a chief executive of his or her sphere of responsibility. Of particular significance are financial officers and their staffs, whose control activities cut across, as well as up and down, the operating and other units of an enterprise. =Board of directors= Management is accountable to the board of directors, which provides governance, guidance and oversight. Effective board members are objective, capable and inquisitive. They also have a knowledge of the entity's activities and environment, and commit the time necessary to fulfil their board responsibilities. Management may be in a position to override controls and ignore or stifle communications from subordinates, enabling a dishonest management which intentionally misrepresents results to cover its tracks. A strong, active board, particularly when coupled with effective upward communications channels and capable financial, legal and internal audit functions, is often best able to identify and correct such a problem. ''' Audit roles and responsibilities =Auditors= The internal auditors and external auditors of the organization also measure the effectiveness of internal control through their efforts. They assess whether the controls are properly designed, implemented and working effectively, and make recommendations on how to improve internal control. They may also review Information technology controls, which relate to the IT systems of the organization. To provide reasonable assurance that internal controls involved in the financial reporting process are effective, they are tested by the external auditor (the organization's public accountants), who are required to opine on the internal controls of the company and the reliability of its financial reporting. =Audit committee= The role and the responsibilities of the audit committee, in general terms, are to: (a) Discuss with management, internal and external auditors and major stakeholders the quality and adequacy of the organization‚Äôs internal controls system and risk management process, and their effectiveness and outcomes, and meet regularly and privately with the Director of Internal Audit; (b) Review and discuss with management and the external auditors and approve the audited financial statements of the organization and make a recommendation regarding inclusion of those financial statements in any public filing. Also review with management and the independent auditor the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives as well as off-balance sheet issues in the organization‚Äôs financial statements; (c) Review and discuss with management the types of information to be disclosed and the types of presentations to be made with respect to the Company's earning press release and financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies; (d) Confirm the scope of audits to be performed by the external and internal auditors, monitor progress and review results and review fees and expenses. Review significant findings or unsatisfactory internal audit reports, or audit problems or difficulties encountered by the external independent auditor. Monitor management's response to all audit findings; (e) Manage complaints concerning accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters; (f) Receive regular reports from the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Company's other Control Committees regarding deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls and any fraud that involves management or other employees with a significant role in internal controls; and (g) Support management in resolving conflicts of interest. Monitor the adequacy of the organization‚Äôs internal controls and ensure that all fraud cases are acted upon. =Personnel benefits committee= The role and the responsibilities of the personnel benefits, in general terms, are to: (a) Approve and oversee administration of the Company's Executive Compensation Program; (b) Review and approve specific compensation matters for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer (if applicable), Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Senior Human Resources Officer, Treasurer, Director, Corporate Relations and Management, and Company Directors; (c) Review, as appropriate, any changes to compensation matters for the officers listed above with the Board; and (d)Review and monitor all human-resource related performance and compliance activities and reports, including the performance management system. They also ensure that benefit-related performance measures are properly used by the management of the organization. =Operating staff= All staff members should be responsible for reporting problems of operations, monitoring and improving their performance, and monitoring non-compliance with the corporate policies and various professional codes, or violations of policies, standards, practices and procedures. Their particular responsibilities should be documented in their individual personnel files. In performance management activities they take part in all compliance and performance data collection and processing activities as they are part of various organizational units and may also be responsible for various compliance and operational-related activities of the organization. Staff and junior managers may be involved in evaluating the controls within their own organizational unit using a control self-assessment. =Continuous controls monitoring= Advances in technology and data analysis have led to the development of numerous tools which can automatically evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. Used in conjunction with continuous auditing, continuous controls monitoring provides assurance on financial information flowing through the business processes. =Auditing standards= There are laws and regulations on internal control related to financial reporting in a number of jurisdictions. In the U.S. these regulations are specifically established by Sections 404 and 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Guidance on auditing these controls is specified in *SSAE No. 18 published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) *Auditing Standard No. 5 published by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) *SEC guidance which is further discussed in SOX 404 top-down risk assessment. Limitations Internal control can provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of an organization will be met. The concept of reasonable assurance implies a high degree of assurance, constrained by the costs and benefits of establishing incremental control procedures. Effective internal control implies the organization generates reliable financial reporting and substantially complies with the laws and regulations that apply to it. However, whether an organization achieves operational and strategic objectives may depend on factors outside the enterprise, such as competition or technological innovation. These factors are outside the scope of internal control; therefore, effective internal control provides only timely information or feedback on progress towards the achievement of operational and strategic objectives, but cannot guarantee their achievement. Describing internal controls Internal controls may be described in terms of: a) the pertinent objective or financial statement assertion b) the nature of the control activity itself. =Objective or assertions categorization= Assertions are representations by the management embodied in the financial statements. For example, if a Financial Statement shows a balance of $1,000 worth of Fixed Assets, this implies that the management asserts that fixed assets actually exist as on the date of the financial statements, the valuation of which is worth exactly $1000 (based on historical cost or fair value depending on the reporting framework and standards) and the entity has complete right/obligation arising from such assets (e.g. if they are leased, it must be disclosed accordingly). Further such fixed assets must be disclosed and represented correctly in the financial statement according to the financial reporting framework applicable to the company. Controls may be defined against the particular financial statement assertion to which they relate. There are five such assertions forming the acronym, \\"PERCV,\\" (pronounced, \\"perceive\\"): # Presentation and disclosure: Accounts and disclosures are properly described in the financial statements of the organization. # Existence/Occurrence/Validity: Only valid or authorized transactions are processed. # Rights and obligations: Assets are the rights of the organization and the liabilities are its obligations as of a given date. # Completeness: All transactions are processed that should be. # Valuation: Transactions are valued accurately using the proper methodology, such as a specified means of computation or formula. For example, a validity control objective might be: \\"Payments are made only for authorized products and services received.\\" A typical control procedure would be: \\"The payable system compares the purchase order, receiving record, and vendor invoice prior to authorizing payment.\\" Management is responsible for implementing appropriate controls that apply to all transactions in their areas of responsibility. =Activity categorization= Control activities may also be explained by the type or nature of activity. These include (but are not limited to): *Segregation of duties ‚Äì separating authorization, custody, and record keeping roles to prevent fraud or error by one person. *Authorization of transactions ‚Äì review of particular transactions by an appropriate person. *Retention of records ‚Äì maintaining documentation to substantiate transactions. *Supervision or monitoring of operations ‚Äì observation or review of ongoing operational activity. *Physical safeguards ‚Äì usage of cameras, locks, physical barriers, etc. to protect property, such as merchandise inventory. *Top-level reviews ‚Äì analysis of actual results versus organizational goals or plans, periodic and regular operational reviews, metrics, and other key performance indicators (KPIs). *IT general controls ‚Äì Controls related to: a) Security, to ensure access to systems and data is restricted to authorized personnel, such as usage of passwords and review of access logs; and b) Change management, to ensure program code is properly controlled, such as separation of production and test environments, system and user testing of changes prior to acceptance, and controls over migration of code into production. *IT application controls ‚Äì Controls over information processing enforced by IT applications, such as edit checks to validate data entry, accounting for transactions in numerical sequences, and comparing file totals with control accounts. =Control precision= Control precision describes the alignment or correlation between a particular control procedure and a given control objective or risk. A control with direct impact on the achievement of an objective (or mitigation of a risk) is said to be more precise than one with indirect impact on the objective or risk. Precision is distinct from sufficiency; that is, multiple controls with varying degrees of precision may be involved in achieving a control objective or mitigating a risk. Precision is an important factor in performing a SOX 404 top-down risk assessment. After identifying specific financial reporting material misstatement risks, management and the external auditors are required to identify and test controls that mitigate the risks. This involves making judgments regarding both precision and sufficiency of controls required to mitigate the risks. Risks and controls may be entity- level or assertion-level under the PCAOB guidance. Entity-level controls are identified to address entity-level risks. However, a combination of entity- level and assertion-level controls are typically identified to address assertion-level risks. The PCAOB set forth a three-level hierarchy for considering the precision of entity-level controls. Later guidance by the PCAOB regarding small public firms provided several factors to consider in assessing precision. Fraud and internal control Internal control plays an important role in the prevention and detection of fraud.Rezaee, Zabihollah. Financial Statement Fraud: Prevention and Detection. New York: Wiley; 2002. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, companies are required to perform a fraud risk assessment and assess related controls. This typically involves identifying scenarios in which theft or loss could occur and determining if existing control procedures effectively manage the risk to an acceptable level. The risk that senior management might override important financial controls to manipulate financial reporting is also a key area of focus in fraud risk assessment. The AICPA, IIA, and ACFE also sponsored a guide published during 2008 that includes a framework for helping organizations manage their fraud risk. Internal controls and process improvement Controls can be evaluated and improved to make a business operation run more effectively and efficiently. For example, automating controls that are manual in nature can save costs and improve transaction processing. If the internal control system is thought of by executives as only a means of preventing fraud and complying with laws and regulations, an important opportunity may be missed. Internal controls can also be used to systematically improve businesses, particularly in regard to effectiveness and efficiency.

Biography Hadjinikos was born in Volos, Greece in 1923. He began his musical education as a child at the Volos Conservatoire in Greece. After moving to Athens in 1934, he continued at the Athens Conservatoire, graduating in 1943 with a piano diploma and a degree in harmony. During this period, he decided to abandon his studies at the Faculty of Law at the University of Athens and devote himself exclusively to music. After World War II, he continued his studies at the Mozarteum in Salzburg and graduated with piano and conducting diplomas in 1948‚Äì1949. He was a recipient of the Lilly Lehmann Medal of the Mozarteum International Foundation. In Salzburg, he met such musicians as Johann Nepomuk David and Paul Hindemith. Hadjinikos had performed several works of Hindemith, including the European premiere in Salzburg of the 2nd version of \\"Marienleben.\\" In 1951, Hadjinikos moved from Salzburg to Munich, where he studied with Carl Orff. Their subsequent friendship continued until Orff's death. In Germany, he gave 80 recitals, in co-operation with the American Information Center, following his performance of Aaron Copland's Piano Sonata in its European premiere. In 1952, Hadjinikos first encountered one of Nikos Skalkottas's works, and he subsequently became an authority on the composer. From 1952 to 1957, he lived in Hamburg, where he studied with Eduard Erdmann at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik. In October 1953, Hadjinikos gave the world premiere in Hamburg of Skalkottas' Piano Concerto No. 2 with the NWDR Symphony Orchestra (now the NDR Symphony) under the baton of Hermann Scherchen.Keller, Hans and Cosman, Milean, Stravinsky the Music-Maker: Writings, Prints and Drawings. Toccata Press (), p. 134 (2010). For this performance, Hadjinikos received a microfilm with the extremely illegible full score, and had to copy the piano part with a magnifying glass in order to learn his part. This performance caused the BBC to take an interest in the work, leading to its subsequent broadcast and the publication of Hans Keller's article 'Nikos Skalkottas: An Original Genius', and subsequent advocacy by Keller for Skalkottas' music in Britain. In December 1954, he discovered several lost Skalkottas manuscripts in a second- hand bookshop in Berlin, for the Octet, two String Quartets, and the Piano Concerto No. 1. From 1957 to 1960, Hadjinikos lived in France, including a period in Paris. A 1959 tour in the Soviet Union included a meeting with Heinrich Neuhaus, who inspired Hadjinikos in the career direction of teaching. After a brief residence in Switzerland of less than a year, in 1961, Hadjinikos joined the piano faculty of the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern College of Music) in the UK. He remained on the faculty for 27 years until his retirement in 1988. In addition to piano, he taught conducting, music history, chamber music, as well as on topics such as 'Harmonization of Praxis and Theory'. In Manchester, he established the \\"New Manchester Ensemble\\", which gave performances of such composers as Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Nikos Skalkottas, Roberto Gerhard, T≈çru Takemitsu, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Jani Christou, and Iannis Xenakis. He continued his scholarship, advocacy and performances of the music of Skalkottas,Kennedy, Michael, The History of the Royal Manchester College of Music. Manchester University Press (), p. 154 (1971). including conducting the world premiere of the Piano Concerto No. 3, giving the world premiere of the 'Five Works for Winds and Piano', the London premiere of the Bassoon Sonata, performing as soloist in the world premiere of the Piano Concerto No. 1, and conducting the world premiere of the Double Bass Concerto. He also led regional orchestras in Hoylake and South Manchester, as well as the Bury Symphony Orchestra. Hadjinikos authored two books, one about Skalkottas accompanied with two CDs, and a book on about Mozart's opera recitatives. His pupils included Gilbert Biberian, Paul Galbraith, Richard Ward-Roden, Teodor Currentzis, Trefor Smith, Robyn Koh, Smaro Gregoriadou, Theodoros Orfanidis and Yiorgo Moutsiaras. In 1990, the University of Pavia awarded him the 'Ugo Foscolo' Medal for his offerings in European Music. He died on November 29, 2015 in Athens.

In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power; 1988 It is the process that translates descriptions and measurements of activities, events and objects into information. By doing so, these activities become visible to the organization. Informating has both an empowering and oppressing influence. On the one hand, as information processes become more powerful, the access to information is pushed to ever lower levels of the organization. Conversely, information processes can be used to monitor what Zuboff calls human agency. Zuboff Description From In the Age of the Smart Machine, Informating is described as: > What is it, then, that distinguishes information technology from earlier > generations of machine technology? As information technology is used to > reproduce, extend, and improve upon the process of substituting machines for > human agency, it simultaneously accomplishes something quite different. The > devices that automate by translating information into action also register > data about those automated activities, thus generating new streams of > information. For example, computer-based, numerically controlled machine > tools or microprocessor-based sensing devices not only apply programmed > instructions to equipment but also convert the current state of equipment, > product, or process into data. Scanner devices in supermarkets automate the > checkout process and simultaneously generate data that can be used for > inventory control, warehousing, scheduling of deliveries, and market > analysis. The same systems that make it possible to automate office > transactions also create a vast overview of an organization's operations, > with many levels of data coordinated and accessible for a variety of > analytical efforts.\\" (Zuboff, 1988; p. 9) Concept As per the Zuboff definition, and examples stated in her book surrounding the concept, any activity, such as two friends using Facebook to communicate to one other whats on their mind. It could also be said they are informating, where using a technological tool such as Facebook, the two friends are converting their activity of thinking or per se something specific to their mutual context, into information. Thereby making their activity visible to friend or friends. With advent of parallelism also the concept of informating is achieving further value. Because any activity done is able to produce multiple streams of information, which may be independent, yet held together by the context, in which they are embedded. Usage of Word Informating as a concept, is being applied to several contexts. For example, in the context of education, Alan November, in his 2010 work, Empowering Students With Technology, wrote: November, Alan. Empowering Students With Technology; 2010. builds on Zuboff's definition: > It is a powerful learning tool because it shifts the power and control to > students by giving access to new sources of information and relationships. > November states, \\"Students have access to content information that was > previously only available in the teacher's edition of the textbook.\\" References Information theory ","title":"Informating"},{"id":"9732467","text":"WRKV (88.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Contemporary Christian music format.

WRKV broadcasts in the HD radio format. History In 1968, Shaw University became the first black college to own a radio station, broadcasting a Jazz/Gospel/Community Interest format as WSHA. At first, the station used an antenna on top of a building on the downtown campus, but in the late 1990s, a new tower was built in southeast Raleigh near Interstate 40. WFSS in Fayetteville, North Carolina moved from 89.1 FM to 91.9 FM to allow WSHA to increase power. WFSS was bought by WUNC and now is part of the WUNC network. In March 2018, Shaw University announced that it would sell the WSHA broadcast license to the Educational Media Foundation. The sale did not include the station's tower, call letters, or equipment; the university's interim president, Paulette Dillard, stated that Shaw intended to continue to stream jazz music on WSHA's website as an Internet radio station.

It connects Poteau to Arkoma. It has no lettered spur routes. Route description SH-112 begins at an intersection with US-59/271 in Poteau, continuing the alignment of the Poteau Bypass. It continues northeast from the intersection, intersecting a railroad at-grade and crossing the Poteau River. The highway then clips the west edge of Cameron. Northeast of Cameron, the road crosses over James Fork. In Rock Island, Highway 112 serves as the western terminus of State Highway 120. At SH-120, it turns more northerly and crosses Backbone Mountain. On the far side of the mountain, SH-112 passes through Pocola. On the north side of town, the highway intersects US-271/SH-9. SH-112 joins the concurrency, headed east. The road becomes a freeway in the run-up to Interstate 540, which begins at the Oklahoma‚ÄìArkansas state line. SH-112 exits at the last interchange in Oklahoma. From here, the highway heads north toward Arkoma, paralleling the state line. SH-112 intersects SH-9A in Arkoma, and one of the two highways continues to the state line. Sources conflict as to which highway continues from this point, and the ultimate location of the northern terminus of SH-112. Signage present as of 2004 indicates that SH-112 continues north to end at the Arkansas state line, where no Arkansas highway exists to connect to it. However, the internal ODOT control section maps show SH-112 ending at SH-9A, and SH-9A ending at the state line. The Oklahoma state highway map distributed to the public is not detailed enough to include a label for the section of highway in question. History State Highway 112 was added to the state highway system on August 15, 1955. Originally, the highway was paved until just south of Cameron, then continued as gravel through Cameron, ending at US-271/SH-9 in what is now Pocola (the town is not shown on contemporary maps). On October 5, 1959, the highway was straightened between Cameron and US-271. By this time, the highway was entirely paved. Further straightening between Cameron and Rock Island occurred on June 1, 1970. The most major change in SH-112's history came on February 5, 1973, when the highway was extended to Arkoma. One further straightening occurred in the Cameron vicinity on June 27, 1982. No further changes have occurred since then.

For 11 years prior to Joyner's purchase of the station, it was a country music station known as \\"99.9 The Fox\\". During Joyner's years as owner, the station was black gospel as \\"Rejoice Radio 99.9\\" and adult standards as \\"Stardust 99.9.\\" Joyner sold WFXQ to Capitol Broadcasting, and the Stardust format moved to WSHV in South Hill, Virginia, one of several Joyner-owned stations purchased by Lakes Media.

In September 2009, Capitol Broadcasting purchased 620 WDNC from McClatchey broadcasting. Along with the purchase came nearly the entire staff of WRBZ (850 The Buzz ‚Äì sister station to WDNC). Brian Maloney, who started the sports talk format in the Raleigh-Durham market and was the general manager of WDNC/WRBZ, was hired by Capitol to spearhead the integration of both WDNC and WCMC. Since moving to the Triangle, WCMC had broadcast from an antenna located 485 feet above ground level located three miles northwest of Youngsville. The short tower and relatively modest power resulted in the station providing only grade B coverage to Chapel Hill, Garner, Cary and most of Durham. In 2010 WCMC was granted permission to move its city of license to Holly Springs and boost its power to 26,500 watts, providing a fairly strong city-grade signal to all of Wake County and most of Durham County. However, Chapel Hill, the third point in the Triangle, still gets only a grade B signal. This may be due to the need to protect WMAG in High Point, at nearby 99.5.

The Sierra Nevada National Park is a protected area within the range. The Cordillera de M√©rida is a series of mountain ranges, or massif, in northwestern Venezuela. The Cordillera de M√©rida is a northeastern extension of the Andes Mountains. The ranges run southwest-northeast between the Venezuelan-Colombian border and the Venezuelan coastal range. The T√°chira depression separates the Cordillera de M√©rida from the Cordillera Oriental, which forms the Colombia-Venezuela border. The ranges runs from southwest to northeast and parts lie within each of the following states: T√°chira, M√©rida, Barinas, Trujillo, Portuguesa and Lara. The southeastern slopes are drained by tributaries of the Orinoco River, while the streams that drain the northwestern slopes empty into Lake Maracaibo. At the northeast tip of the massif lies the town of Barquisimeto and the headwaters of the River Cojedes. In the centre of the massif is the city of M√©rida. Two ranges of peaks lie on either side of the city, the Sierra de la Culata to the north and Sierra Nevada de M√©rida to the south. Pico Bol√≠var, at 4,981 meters elevation (16,342 feet), is the highest peak in Venezuela. Most of the ranges are covered by Venezuelan Andes montane forests, although the highest elevations (above 3,100 meters) are above tree line. These ranges are home to the Cordillera de M√©rida p√°ramo, an enclave of the p√°ramo (tropical alpine grasslands) of the northern Andes. Protected areas in the massif include Sierra Nevada National Park. Glaciers In 1991 the mountain range had five glaciers situated near its peaks. However, as of 2017, only one glacier (10% of its size 30 years earlier) remains near Pico Humboldt. It is predicted this last glacier will disappear within the next ten or twenty years. The snowy season is between July‚ÄìAugust. The snows cover the mountains above 4.200 meters, and sometimes above 3.800 meters.[2]  Gallery  File:La cascada el velo de la novia.JPGEl Velo de la Novia waterfall File:Quebrada Mucubaj√≠, Sierra de Santo Domingo.JPGSierra de Santo Domingo File:Laguna mucubaji.jpgMucubaj√≠ lagoon See also *Sierra Nevada National Park (Venezuela) *Sierra La Culata *Merida glaciation References External links * Schubert, Carlos (1998) \\"Glaciers of Venezuela\\" United States Geological Survey (USGS P 1386-I) Mountain ranges of the Andes Mountain ranges of Venezuela Glaciers of Venezuela Geography of M√©rida (state) Geography of Barinas (state) Sierra Nevada National Park (Venezuela) ","title":"Sierra Nevada de M√©rida"},{"id":"9732570","text":"Flatfish is the second album, and debut studio recording, by Anglo-Irish celtic music group Flook, released in 1999 on Flatfish Records.

His father Cornelis Boon, a Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) sergeant, was Dutch and his Indo-European mother Fela Robinson was part Scottish and Javanese. He is considered to be the author of unique Indo literature. Tjalie Robinson became the most influential post war Indo activist of his generation and the most important promoter of Indo culture anywhere.

In his most vivid description of the Eurasian nature of his Indo identity Tjalie Robinsion wrote: > \\"I did not care that people wanted to call me ‚Äòneither fish nor fowl,‚Äô and > wanted to label me (an Indo), either Indonesian or Dutch.

When he was a 3 month old baby his family returned to the Dutch East Indies. As a child he lived and went to primary school in Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara). He attended secondary schooling (MULO) in Batavia (now Jakarta). Although an eager and astute student he was also an avid and allround athlete and boxer, winning the Silver medal at the high jump and the Gold medal at the pentathlon during the Athletics Championships of Java in 1933. After completing college and obligatory military serviceIn 1933 Jan Boon served as conscript mariner with the Dutch Royal Navy on the military cruiser HNLMS Java. he got married18 December 1934 Jan Boon married his first wife, the Indo-European teacher Edith de Bruijn in the Rehoboth church in Batavia. and went on to become a teacher at the so-called 'Wild (unsubsidised) Schools' on Java and Sumatra. In 1936 he became a contributing editor for the 'Batavian Newspaper' (Dutch: Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad), founded in 1885 by author P.A.Daum. It was one of the leading newspapers in the Dutch East Indies, that had also employed other important Indo writers like Karel Zaalberg, Ernest Douwes Dekker and Victor Ido.Note: During his period with the Batavian Newspaper he used the alias 'Jan van Nimwegen'. See: Iburg, Nora ‚ÄúVan Pasar Malam tot I Love Indo, identiteitsconstructie en manifestatie door drie generaties Indische Nederlanders.‚Äù (Master thesis, Arnhem University, 2009, Ellessy Publishers, 2010) p.83 . During World War II (1942‚Äì1945) he was interned in various Japanese concentration camps such as Tjimahi and the infamous Changi Prison. Imprisoned in Tjimahi Tjalie Robinson kept on writing. He was part of a small group of intellectuals (including Leo Vroman and Rob Nieuwenhuys) that engaged in cultural activity.This group consisted of Reverend Selms, Rob Nieuwenhuys (author), Bernard van Tijn, Kurt Binners (politician), Henk Vis (painter) and Leo Vroman (poet).

Kunsten in beweging 1900-1980 (Publisher: Sdu Uitgevers, The Hague, 2003) See DBNL: For a while Tjalie Robinson was even able to print a camp periodical named 'Kampkroniek' (Camp Chronicles) and a pamphlet named 'Onschendbaar Domein' (Inviolable Domain). The gruesome war experience obviously influenced his life philosophy, nevertheless Tjalie Robinson never wrote much about his years as a POW. On occasion he tried to reflect with an uneasy mix of shame and fascination: > \\"Sometimes I reluctantly look back at that time I am supposed to hate. (60 > years and 60 thousand emotions packed into 1 night.) Surrounded by life- > threatening situations and you know your alone against Fate. Fight, Johny > Brown, fight.

Jassin. The latter book into German in 1993 by W.H√ºsmert. English translations by M. Alibasah were published in 1995. From 1952 to 1954 he worked as journalist for the newspaper 'Nieuwsgier' where he was continuously reflecting on life in his ever-changing homeland and wrote most of his often re-printed work 'Piekerans van een straatslijper.' 'Piekerans' (Musings) is the Petjok word Tjalie Robinson used to name his weekly essays in the newspaper, which in essence do not significantly differ from the work of his famous Dutch contemporary in the Netherlands Simon Carmiggelt. Together their work grew into a separate genre in Dutch literature and found successors in among others Rudy Kousbroek.Buikema, Rosemarie and Meijer, Maaike (red.), Cultuur en migratie in Nederland. Kunsten in beweging 1900-1980 (Publisher: Sdu Uitgevers, The Hague, 2003) See DBNL: He also became contributing editor with the cultural and literary magazine 'Orientatie', which published many of his short stories. In his story writing he excelled as a literary interpreter of everyday life of Indos in the Dutch East Indies. Life in the Netherlands In 1955 he left for the Netherlands and first lived in Amsterdam and later in The Hague, where he became a zealous activist for the preservation of Indo culture. Initially he wrote columns reflecting on repatriation in Dutch newspaper 'Het Parool', where he became a direct colleague of Simon Carmiggelt, and simultaneously kept catering for the Indos still in Indonesia by writing for Surabaya based 'De Vrije Pers' (The Free Press). He originally attempted to find connection with the cultural and literary establishment of the Netherlands, but unwilling to assimilate he wanted to establish his own cultural network of Indo authors and artists. To groom the 62-year-old Indo author Maria Dermo√ªt who successfully debuted in 1955 he wrote her: \\"I am Mrs Dermo√ªt, a barefoot child of the free seas and free mountains. Even when death would be my prediction, I will keep fighting an injustice that does not threaten me personally, but our cultural conscience (if there is such a thing).\\" He soon started a short- lived magazine called 'Gerilja' (Guerrilla), sub-titled 'Magazine for Self- preservation', after which he took over editorial responsibility of the monthly magazine 'De Brug' (The Bridge) in 1957, which he wanted to transform into a weekly Indo magazine. This became the predecessor of his magazine ‚ÄòTong Tong‚Äô, sub-titled 'The only Indo magazine in the Netherlands', established one year later (1958) and that lives on to this day under the name ‚ÄòMoesson‚Äô.Tjalie Robinsons 'Moesson' magazine The magazine's main target audience was the Indo community in diaspora. At its peak in 1961 the magazine had 11,000 paying subscribers and reached an estimated 77,000 readers, one third of the Indo community in the Netherlands.Willems, Wim \\"De uittocht uit Indie (1945‚Äì1995), De geschiedenis van Indische Nederlanders\\" (Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2001) p.239 Another living monument of his achievements is the annual Pasar Malam Besar (renamed to 'Tong Tong Fair' in 2009) which he co-founded in 1959.Tjalie Robinsons 'Tong Tong Fair' aka ‚ÄòPasar Malam Besar‚Äô In a 1958 example how Tjalie Robinson used the Tong Tong Magazine to elucidate both his own Indo community and Dutch public opinion, his editorial reaction to a government study about the repatriation from Indonesia contradicts the widespread notion Indo culture was merely a thin facade laid over a Dutch foundation. Using the evidence of centuries old Portuguese family names many Indos carried and matriarchal kinship relations within Eurasian communities, he argued that in origin the Indos sprang from an ancient mestizo culture going back all the way to the beginning of the European involvement in Asia.Goss, Andrew From Tong-Tong to Tempo Doeloe: Eurasian Memory Work and the Bracketing of Dutch Colonial History, 1957-1961 (Publisher: University of New Orleans, New Orleans, 2000) P.26-27 Online History Faculty Publications UNO When in 1960 and 1961 he published his best-known work, respectively the books Tjies and Tjoek, Dutch literary critics immediately praised his style and narrative. However they found it hard to comprehend the Indies environment he was describing. Tjalie Robinson himself consequently decided to give all his focus to the advancement of the Indo community in diaspora and the social objectives he coupled to that, by solely publishing in his own magazine. In 1963 he wrote: \\"I couldnt care less about literary life, in reality that only means your a name in a bookcase. Writing should have a living social function. 90% of what we call literature is just phraseology, obsequious embellishment and blatherskite.\\" Willems, Wim ‚ÄòSporen van een Indisch verleden (1600‚Äì1942).‚Äô (Publisher: COMT, Faculty of Social Sciences Leiden University, 1994). Chapter III, Anthonie, W. De jacht: levensfilosofie in het werk van Tjalie Robinson P.203 Tjalie Robinson developed a life philosophy that evolves around the nature of the Hunt, regularly writing about the practice of hunting as a parable for 'real' and 'truthful' living as he saw it. In his stories the Hunt often returns as a theme to intellectually explore 'dangerous' and 'courageous' life and particularly to depict the life and culture of Indos. In the Netherlands he emerged as a sharp critic of assimilation, putting the hunting lifestyle of the Indo opposite to mundane lifestyle in the West.Willems, Wim ‚ÄòSporen van een Indisch verleden (1600‚Äì1942).‚Äô (Publisher: COMT, Faculty of Social Sciences Leiden University, 1994).

Rudy Kousbroek, 1989.Kousbroek, Rudy Het Oostindisch kampsyndroom. > (Publisher: Olympus, 2005) P.131 Later years In search of a global vision on Indo culture and in a continued effort to resist assimilation Tjalie Robinson traveled to Latin America where he compared the Indo community with the racially mixed people of that continent. Already in the Dutch East Indies he had admired the status of the Creole language Papiamento and the cultural expressions of the Dutch Antilles. He also sympathised with the philosophical writings of the Spanish essayist Jose Ortega y Gasset, an outspoken proponent of perspectivism and in 1961 even initiated the creation of an Indo enclave in Spain, named 'El Atabal'.Willems, Wim De uittocht uit Indie, 1945-1995. (Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2001) P.247 Later he moved to the United States (1963‚Äì1968) and lived in Whittier, California, where he founded 'The American Tong Tong‚Äô. He felt there was less resistance in the USA to ethnic profiling of minorities and to create a cultural sanctuary for Indos he set up the Indo Community Center 'De Soos'Huping, Ling \\"Emerging voices: experiences of underrepresented Asian Americans.\\" (Publisher: Rutgers University Press, 2008) P.101 See: in Victorville, near Los Angeles, which only allowed membership to people that were also subscribed to the 'American Tong Tong' magazine.Iburg, Nora ‚ÄúVan Pasar Malam tot I Love Indo, identiteitsconstructie en manifestatie door drie generaties Indische Nederlanders.‚Äù (Master thesis, Arnhem University, 2009, Ellessy Publishers, 2010) p.85 . Already before his emigration to the USA he was full of admiration for multi-cultural New York City and wrote: \\"All these different ethnic minorities (in New York City) are allowed to be who they are (only in Holland we still believe in the folly of assimilation) and - strange as it may sound - they are all American. And now look at how richly they affect New York. All these people that can remain true to themselves, give their own flair and character to American life.\\" Tjalie Robinson comparing New York City to old Batavia in his 'Tong Tong' magazine in 1961.

See DBNL: His literary work found comparisons with Flannery O'Connor, writer of Mystery and Manners. Occasional Prose. (as well as other Southern United States authors like Faulkner and Eudora Welty), who appropriately wrote that \\"great talent can put a small local history into a universal light\\".O'Connor, Flannery Mystery and Manners. Occasional Prose. (New York, 1969) P.58 In his analysis of Tjalie Robinson professor E.M. Beekman also pointed out that he quite often cited or referred to American authors like: Mark Twain, Henry Miller, Tennessee Williams, T. S. Eliot and even Robert Frost when he was still an unknown writer in Europe. To save the Dutch 'Tong Tong' magazine that was suffering from a dwindling number of subscribers he returned to the Netherlands in 1968, where he spent the final years of his life. Tjalie Robinson died in 1974. The necrology of this \\"avant garde visionary\\" reads: \\"In The Hague at the age of 63 Indo journalist and author Tjalie Robinson passed away. After his return from Indonesia he had wholeheartedly given his all to preserve the unique identity of the Indo community in the Netherlands. [...] Many of his endeavours encountered resistance, but appreciation was paramount.\\" Kousbroek, Rudy Het Oostindisch kampsyndroom. (Publisher: Olympus, 2005) P.114 His ashes were scattered in the Java Sea at Sunda Kelapa in Jakarta the same year.

(Publisher: Olympus, 2005) P.130 Legacy Part of his literary legacy is the fact that he wrote much of his work in the Indo mix language called Petjok, also known as petjo or pecuk, giving it a status that it never had in the Dutch East Indies and providing academic linguistic research a substantial database.Stokhof, Wim \\"Proceedings of the seventh International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics: Leiden 22‚Äì27 August 1994\\" (Publisher: Rodobi, Amsterdam, 1997) Chapter II, Morphology, Verbal morphology in Javindo and Pecok, by Jan W. de Vries.

He was the twenty-sixth (26th) Kabaka of Buganda. Claim to the throne He was the son of Kabaka Kyabaggu Kabinuli, Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned between 1750 and 1780. His mother was Nanteza, the seventeenth (17th) of his father's twenty (20) wives. He ascended to the throne upon the death of his father. He established his capital at Magonga. Married life He is recorded to have married four wives: * Katagya, daughter of Gabunga, of the Mamba clan * Nakamu I, daughter of Lwoomwa, of the Ndiga clan * Nakamu II, daughter of Katambala, of the Ndiga clan * Tebwaaza, daughter of Kasamba, of the Mbogo (Water Buffalo) clan Issue He is recorded to have fathered three children; one son and two daughters: * Prince (Omulangira) Semalume, whose mother was Nakamu I * Princess (Omumbejja) Nakabiri, whose mother is not mentioned * Princess (Omumbejja) Kyomubi, whose mother was Katagya His reign During his reign, Buganda conquered Buddu (in present-day Masaka District) from Bunyoro. His reign was interrupted by the struggle between him and his brother Prince Semakookiro, who rebelled against him. During the rebellion, Semakookiro ordered his men to go and capture Kabaka Jjunju and bring him to the rebel prince. The expedition went badly. Kabaka Jjunju was killed during the attempted capture. When the regiment sent to capture the Kabaka came back to report that they had killed him, Semakookiro was so upset that he expelled all the regiment members together with their families and friends from Buganda, or else they would suffer the same fate as his brother. The expelled people fled Buganda and went westwards to present day Kitagwenda in Kamwenge District and Bunyaruguru in Rubirizi District, Western Uganda. This group of descendants were the reason why Kitagwenda and Bunyaruguru are called thus today. Kitagwenda seems to mean those who cannot go further and Bunyaruguru means those with strong-legs. Indeed, Kitagwenda is east of Bunyaruguru and is a plain area while Bunyaruguru is a hilly area west of Kitagwenda. Those without strong legs stayed in Kitagwenda and those who moved on and climbed the hills became the Banyaruguru. The final years He was killed in the Battle of Kiwawu, against his brother Semakookiro, in 1797. He was buried at Luwunga, Busiro. Another version of the death of Junju is that he was killed by the then Baganda of Ssese Islands, following a disagreement that erupted as a result of mistreatment. The aggreaved group fled to the east escaping from the attacks that were being planned by the mainland Baganda. When they reached the area of present-day Busoga and Samia region, they identified themselves as \\"bagenyi\\" which means \\"visitors\\" to the people of those areas. They settled in the area and took on new names such as \\"Musana\\", \\"Wegulo\\", \\"Wacha\\" in order to hide from the Kabaka's agents who were looking for them. They adopted new culture and their language was amalgamated with Samia and Lusoga. Today these migrants are known as Bakenyi or Bakenye. The Bakenyi can be found among the Basoga, Bagwere, Balamogi, and the Samia proper. Some retained some aspects of their Kiganda culture; members of the Ngo Clan (Leopard Clan) renamed themselves the Babango and changed their totem to the Guinea Fowl (Nkofu). The Ngabi Clan (Antelope Clan) became the Bakoma and the Bagulu.

His parents divorced, and his mother later married her long-time paramour, the architect (Sir) Roy Grounds. Ramsay studied at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1957. He worked briefly for the BBC then returned to Australia. He joined the fledgling Union Theatre Company in Melbourne, whose members included Zoe Caldwell and Barry Humphries. He starred in the first Adelaide Festival in 1960, in Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. He went to the United States in 1961 and joined the Theatre Company of Boston. He then toured the country in The National Repertory Theatre, with Eva Le Gallienne and Faye Emerson. In 1964 he took the role of Fagin in the hit musical Oliver! on Broadway, a role he played for a further two years in New York, followed by a record-breaking national tour. He shared the bill with the Beatles, singing a song from the musical in a subsequently memorable edition of The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1966 Ramsay recreated his role of Fagin for a West End revival of Oliver!, with Marti Webb as Nancy. Returning to Australia, Ramsay's role as Charlie Cousens, the dodgy real estate agent in Bellbird, Australia's first successful television soap opera, garnered him considerable public notice. A regular character on the show from August 1967, Ramsay decided to leave in May 1968 to take the role of Fagin in a Japanese stage production of Oliver!. When the show's producers decided to kill off his character, staging what has been described as \\"one of the most-watched and best-remembered moments in Australian TV history\\",Superstar: The Australian Production at MilesAgo: Australasian Music & Popular Culture 1964-1975 Accessed 5 November 2012 fans wrote protesting his death and even sent flowers to his funeral. Ramsay returned to the theatre playing the controversial priest Daniel Berrigan in the Trial of the Catonsville Nine in Sydney. He went on to play Pontius Pilate in 's original production of Jesus Christ Superstar. He was in the first production at the opening of the Sydney Opera House in 1972: playing MacHeath in The Threepenny Opera. Polly Peachum was played by Pamela Stephenson. Ramsay spent the next few years as a leading actor with the Sydney Theatre Company the Melbourne Theatre Company, and working in film and television. He has twice won the Melbourne Critics Circle Award for Best Actor. He was in Medea the opening production of the Melbourne Arts Centre, playing opposite Zoe Caldwell. In 1977, with Rodney Fisher, he developed his first solo show, drawn from the writings of Henry Lawson, The Bastard From The Bush. at Cameron's agency. Accessed 5 November 2012. This refocusing on Lawson as a sophisticated short-story writer and diarist, rather than as a 'bush poet', radically altered Australia's view of their favourite icon. The play toured to Riverside Studios in London, and played extended seasons at Sydney's Belvoir Street Theatre and the Victorian Arts Centre. The production won the Australian Arts Award In the early 1980s Ramsay was commissioned to create a new solo show celebrating the life and times of Rabindranath Tagore, India's Nobel Prize- winning poet: titled Borderland. The invitation came from the Indian High Commission in Canberra. The play was performed in Australia, then toured to more than 60 countries, in tandem with The Bastard From The Bush. The tour was sponsored by the Australian Government, the British Council and the Indian Government. Ramsay then formed his own chamber theatre company, \\"Open Secret\\", and continued touring internationally, developing new productions, notably Vikram Seth's Beastly Tales from Here and There and incorporating local musicians into the company's presentations. His new solo play The Accidental Mystic, high times on the Indian ashram trail, written by his wife Barbara Bossert, opened at Melbourne's Malthouse Theatre in 1995, after seasons in Sydney and the Edinburgh Festival. The play toured to London and throughout India. Ramsay was nominated for a Melbourne Critics Circle Best Actor Award for his performance. In 1994 he played Julie Christie's husband, Wilf Barlow, in the miniseries Dada is Death, and toured to the Tokyo International Theatre Festival with the Playbox Theatre. In 2008 he produced and directed the feature film Tao of the Traveller, a spiritual adventure film which won a Best Film Award at the South African International Film Festival 2008, and has been selected for screening at the British Film Festival Los Angeles 2009, Egypt International Film Festival 2009, Thailand International Film Festival 2009, and Swansea Bay International Film Festival 2009. In 2008 the film was also invited to the Fallbrook Film Festival in California, and won awards in the Research and Experimental categories at the Accolade Film Festival. Ramsay became interested in Eastern spiritual matters in the 1960s and studied Taoism and Buddhism and many of the mystical poets such as Rumi, Tagore and Hafiz. During the 1980s, he came across the teachings of Brother Lekhraj Kripalani, now formalised as the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University, while still performing with Open Secret. From 2003 to 2006 he was coordinator of a Brahma Kumaris retreat centre near Wilton New South Wales. Ramsay was invited to recreate his Tagore show Borderland in London, for the Lord Mayor of London's \\"India Now\\" celebrations. In 2008 Ramsay was asked by BK management to make a film on the history of the Brahma Kumaris. After research in the British and New York public libraries, it became apparent that the group's history had been seriously compromised in its statements and publications. Ramsay's subsequent film on the group, drawn from original BKWSU sources, after its initial popular screening to adherents, was banned from being screened to stakeholders by BK management. BK management held a poll among those who had attended the screening, claiming the audience had strongly disapproved of the film. This turned out to be false, and management apologised. Since 2009 Ramsay has been a curator of the forest retreat 'Sanctuary Australia' in northern NSW. The retreat is run on Brahma Kumaris principles, while embracing a cruelty free diet and lifestyle, that is to say Vegan, unlike BKWSU. Select filmography *Mercury TV series.

It is popular not only in Nepal but also in Gorkhali or Nepalese diaspora households worldwide. The annual production of gundruk in Nepal is estimated at 2,000 tons and most of the production is carried out at the household level. Gundruk is obtained from the fermentation of leafy vegetables (saag; ). It is served as a side dish with the main meal and is also used as an appetizer. Gundruk is an important source of minerals, particularly during the off-season when the diet consists of mostly starchy tubers and maize, which tend to be low in minerals. Raw material preparation In the months of October and November, during the harvest of the first broad mustard, mustard green, radish and cauliflower leaves, large quantities of leaves accumulate ‚Äî much more than can be consumed fresh. These leaves are allowed to wilt for one or two days and are then shredded with a knife or sickle. Not only the leaves of the radish but also the roots are used to make a better quality gundruk. The roots of the radish can be mixed with the leaves and smashed together. When it is smashed, care should be taken not to make the pieces too small. In the mountainous regions of the central part of Nepal, the smashed radish and leaves are put into an earthenware container, compressed, and the mouth of container is closed tightly. It is then buried in a safe and sunny place. It may be placed in an open place. After a few days, the acidity can be tasted, or this can be gauged from its smell. It is then dried in sunlight. Gundruk prepared in this manner is more tasty, more flavorsome and more acidic. Processing The shredded leaves are tightly packed in an earthenware pot, and warm water (at about 30 ¬∞C) is added to cover all the leaves. The pot is then kept in a warm place. After a week, a mild acidic taste indicates the end of fermentation and the Gundruk is removed and dried in the sun. This process is similar to sauerkraut or kimchi production except that no salt is added to the shredded leaves before the start of gundruk fermentation. The ambient temperature at the time of fermentation is about 18 ¬∞C. Pediococcus and Lactobacillus species are the predominant microorganisms active during Gundruk fermentation. During fermentation, the pH drops slowly to a final value of 4.0 and the amount of acid (as lactic) increases to about 1% on the sixth day. It has been found that a disadvantage with the traditional process of Gundruk fermentation is the loss of 90% of the carotenoids, probably during sun-drying. Improved methods of drying might reduce the vitamin loss.

Building of the present church began on 4 June 1889, with the laying of the foundation stone by the Bishop of Guildford. It was opened on 13 October 1892.  History  Saint Aubin was a busy port at least as far back as the 16th century, with its own harbour and Court House. In 1747 a church was built at St Aubin, the first to be erected in the island since the Reformation. This was the result of a petition to the Bishop of Winchester from the merchants of St Aubin in which they made their case for the erection of a chapel of ease, in which they mentioned the difficulty of travelling to St Brelade, a distance of about two miles: \\"[T]he road to the said Church is very difficult by reason of many rugged steep ascents and descents, and a great way of moving sands, and the said inhabitants are exposed to great fatigue by sheer scorching heat in the summer, and the storms of impetuous westerly winds which usually blows there in Winter ‚Ä¶\\" The original church was a square building which stood on the site of the present church car park. In 1888 it was pronounced unsafe. A meeting was held on 19 April 1889, and it was resolved that a committee be formed to collect funds and arrange the building of a new church. The foundation stone of the present building was laid by the Bishop of Guildford on 4 June 1889. The granite of the old building was re-used and the funds raised (¬£2,500) also allowed extra columns, arches and windows in Mont Mado granite. St Aubin on the Hill is very fine example of a Victorian Gothic style building. The small north window in the Lady Chapel is notable for being the only Pre-Raphaelite window in Jersey, created by the firm of William Morris from designs by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. At the north end of the nave, the altar which bears the logo of the St Brelade Group of Churches, and the platform on which it stands, were added in the 1980s under the curacy of Robert Booth. In the early part of 1992 further re-ordering saw the removal of a number of pews and the construction of a platform around the font at the south end. There were no burials at St Aubin until the 1980s, when authority was granted by the Ecclesiastical Court of Jersey to allow the curate, the Reverend Robert Booth to inter some ashes which had been sent for burial from England.

Often a film becomes successful, popular or attains cult status and the franchise produces spin-offs that may include comics. The comics can be direct adaptations of the film, a continuation of the story using the characters, or both. Comics allow a degree of flexibility which can result in crossovers with other film characters as well as those from comics. In particular, the Aliens and Predator comics have crossed over with The Terminator, Superman, Batman, Judge Dredd and Green Lantern. There are a number of companies that specialise in licensed properties, including Dark Horse, Titan, Avatar and Dynamite Entertainment.

This instrument is the 12 string variant of the Rickenbacker 360. Rickenbacker uses an innovative headstock design that incorporates both a slotted-style peghead and a solid peghead, thereby eliminating the need for the larger headstock normally associated with a twelve-string guitar. Another feature unique to Rickenbacker twelve-strings is the ordering of the courses. Most twelve-strings have the octave course on the bass side of the standard course; Rickenbacker reverses this convention. This feature along with the semi-hollow body design and thru-body neck structure contribute to its unique timbre. The 360/12 was given worldwide attention when George Harrison used it on many Beatles recordings, introducing the distinctive new sound of this guitar on \\"I Call Your Name\\", which the band recorded in March 1964.The Beatles and their Rickenbacker Guitars In the late 1960s, the company made alternative models such as the Rickenbacker 370/12, which became the favored instrument of Roger McGuinn of the Byrds. Origin Rickenbacker began developing its electric twelve-string in 1963. The folk music revival of the early '60s witnessed a surge in the popularity of acoustic twelve-string guitars, but the electric variety was still rare. The company created three prototypes, all incorporating the unique headstock design submitted by employee Dick Burke. The design features three tuners on each side mounted as on a standard guitar, with the tuner posts projecting out from the face of the headstock. Two parallel channels are machined into the face of the headstock, reminiscent of the slots in the headstock of a classical guitar, but cut only halfway through the headstock. The headstock routes on 360/12s made after 2005 extend through the headstock, though vintage reissue guitars such as the 360/12C63 remain as before. Three more tuners are attached to each side of the headstock. The knobs of the tuners project towards the rear of the headstock, and the posts transect the slots in the headstock. The original tuners (machines) were Kluson brand, though after 1982 Grover Rotomatics were used for a time, with Schaller M6 Minis becoming standard in 1985. This innovation minimizes the size of the headstock, and keeps the instrument from feeling \\"head-heavy\\" in the player's hands. It is also one of the very few twelve string guitars to use a conventional width six-string neck, making it somewhat more difficult to play cleanly for those with large hands/fingers, as the string courses are much closer together than they would normally be on most twelve string guitars. The Beatles in 1964, showing George Harrison with his original style 1963 Rickenbacker 360 12 stringRickenbacker gave the first of these prototypes to Suzi Arden, a Las Vegas country music entertainer. Another prototype was featured at a special display at the Savoy Hilton hotel in New York City in 1964. This display was a showcase for The Beatles, who were in town to play on The Ed Sullivan Show. Despite missing the display due to illness, George Harrison ended up with the twelve-string prototype. His prominent use of the instrument in the film A Hard Day's Night led to high demand for Rickenbacker's twelve-string. When production began in 1964, Rickenbacker changed some features from those of the prototype. The edge of the body was rounded off around the top of the guitar, and white plastic binding was added to the soundhole. Production models retained the prototypes' use of the rectangular trapeze tailpiece until late 1964, when twelve-string models were fitted with Rickenbacker's \\"R\\" tailpiece. The last 360/12 OS was produced in Fireglo and made in December 1968 S/N HL1725.(Ref. R.Smith) After 1969, the 360/12 gained a 24-fret neck instead of the traditional 21-fret neck. Two models were produced: the two-pickup 360/12, and the three-pickup 370/12 (favored by Roger McGuinn of The Byrds). The distinctive \\"jangly\\" sound of the Rickenbacker 360/12, while approached by other electric twelve strings, has a uniqueness of tone that is unavailable in other guitars of the same type, making it a high-value commodity to musicians attempting to get that particular sound. It continues to sell well to the end of 2018. A notable variant of the 360/12 was the Model 366, that took a standard 360/12 and added a convertible comb device to the body used to clamp the octave strings down against the fretboard, effectively muting them on the fly for obtaining a conventional six string sound from the same instrument during live performances.

It is a tributary of the Una, into which it flows near Bosanski Novi. It is the longest of the nine rivers that flow through Sanski Most, and is 142 km long. It is not a navigable waterway. TOC Name The name of the river derives from the Latin word sana, which means \\"healthy\\". Course and sections The Sana and Ribnik rivers wellspring groups One of three major wellsprings of the Sana =Springs and Upper Sana= The Ribnik river is a short but significant tributary of the Sana The Sana in its upper course is fast mountain river with upland freshwater ecology, and its waters being very clear and cold. Gushing out of the karst plateau with Ovƒçara as most prominent summit (1576 m), between Klekovaƒça and Vitorog mountains, and flows toward alluvial plains of the Bosanska Krajina with lowland freshwater ecology. Well-spring areal is located in the vicinity of Mariƒái village, between surrounding villages of Gornja and Donja Peƒçka, Gornji and Donji Vrbljani, and Medna, on the territories of Ribnik and Mrkonjiƒá Grad municipality not far from the town of ≈†ipovo. The source itself consists of four major and water abundant karstic well-springs, with relatively high average discharge, and after about hundred meters first three individual wellsprings merge with a main course, which is set by the small stream of Korana coming from the right form direction of Gornja Peƒçka village, receiving the Sana springs one-by-one, with first three supplementing it from the left and, after just a little more than one kilometre downstream, with the fourth from the right. This fourth well-spring is also known for the Mraƒçaj karstic cave from which it emerges. From this point the Sana is formed river, with steady average discharge. The river at this point is still with low average discharge, and receiving the waters of several other smaller streams, but after just about 17 km the Sana meet with its first major tributary, the short but water abundant river, the Ribnik. The area surrounding confluence of the two rivers is called Ribnik, and is divaded between two settlements, Gornji and Donji Ribnik. From Ribnik, the Sana runs through a valley in a south-to-north-northwestern direction as it reach the historic town of Kljuƒç. =Middle course= The Sanica river, lower section, just few kilometres before it meat the Sana. At this point, passing through Kljuƒç, the upper course ends and river enters its midsection narrow gorge, with steep but relatively low slopes, while turning its course to more clear south-to-north direction. The river here combines with the waters of several typical karstic streams, abundant in water but short in length. Its main tributary is water abundant the Sanica river, which flows east-to-west from the direction of Grmeƒç mountain, and in this section reaches the Sana from the left at . After 72 km and the altitude difference of 262.52 m, the Sana then passes through Sanski Most and combines with the significant tributary rivers, the Dabar, the Zdena and the Bliha river, both from the left, and two other smaller one. From here it runs toward the town of Prijedor, where its middle section ends, and where it receives the waters of Gomjenica river from the right. =Lower Sana= The Sana river in Prijedor Novi Grad The Sana then turns sharply under an angle of almost 90 degrees and heads west toward its final destination in Bosanski Novi (also known as Novi Grad), where it empties into the Una river as its most important and largest tributary. From Sanski Most, through Prijedor, to its confluence with the Una in Bosanski Novi, average drop is 41.21 m. Between Prijedor and Bosanski Novi, the river also serves as a natural border between the two subregions, Potkozarje and Podgrmeƒç. In this section the Sana is characteristically lowland river. Before the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a paper mill \\"Celpak\\" in Prijedor was draining wastewater into the Sana, just downstream from the town, so that the further flow of the river was considered polluted. From the outset of the war, and after the war to this day, the factory has been shut down and the discharge of wastewater is reduced to significantly smaller scale. At the center of Bosanski/Novi Grad the Sana reaches the Una river.

It was first proposed by mathematician David Blackwell. In this model, a transmitter transmits one of three symbols to two receivers. For two of the symbols, both receivers receive exactly what was sent; the third symbol, however, is received differently at each of the receivers. This is one of the simplest examples of a non-trivial capacity result for a non-stochastic channel.  Definition  The Blackwell channel is composed of one input (transmitter) and two outputs (receivers). The channel input is ternary (three symbols) and is selected from {0, 1, 2}. This symbol is broadcast to the receivers; that is, the transmitter sends one symbol simultaneously to both receivers. Each of the channel outputs is binary (two symbols), labeled {0, 1}. Whenever a 0 is sent, both outputs receive a 0. Whenever a 1 is sent, both outputs receive a 1. When a 2 is sent, however, the first output is 0 and the second output is 1.

Knox grew up in the Mojave Desert. Her father was an accountant and mother, a speech therapist. Her father was from Nova Scotia, and being from Nova Scotia she explains he had a very satirical sense of humor, Nova Scotians share the British love of understated, self-deprecating satire. Influences Knox names poets Richard Hugo, Denis Johnson, James Galvin, Wallace Stevens and James Tate, and fiction writers Italo Calvino and Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe as great influences. Style The poetry of Jennifer L. Knox is very bold and real. Her poems are filled with humor, pop culture, and quite frequently, profanity. She delves into the pop culture of modern America today without censorship. Knox makes use of strong diction, hyperboles, and metaphors. What's striking about Knox's work is that she seems willing to say almost anything, which sounds like it could be self- indulgent but which in her hands turns into a powerful, idiosyncratic account of American culture. She has described her reader as \\"a man, dressed like a woman, is over 40 but wider than a mile, 9 feet tall, all that, is a Camaro owner ... happily answers all telephone surveys\\" \\"In workshops, my poems were often described as ‚Äúsarcastic‚Äù and ‚Äúironic‚Äù‚Äîbut neither label ever made sense to me.

ISSN 0891-1851 A version with the front electric sustainer is available Design and construction Alisport Silent 2 The fuselage is carbon and glass fiber composite with epoxy resin. The wings have an elliptical planform, vertical or elliptical design winglets. The wing structure includes extensive use of carbon fiber, both in the sandwich skins and in the tapered I-beam wing spar which uses pultruded carbon rods for the spar caps. The wing geometry is notable in that it varies non-linearly from the root to the tip, both in overall planform shape and in wing section profile. The flaperons stretch for 11.0 meters of the full wingspan and their range of motion varies from positive landing L +8¬∞, to +4¬∞ for thermalling, to 0¬∞, -4¬∞, and S -8¬∞ reflex positions for cruising. Schempp-Hirth-type spoilers extend on the upper wing surface only. There is a fixed main wheel behind the pilot, with shock absorber and drum brake activated via spoiler control lever aft travel. Safety and operational qualities The Silent 2 has light ailerons, light elevator, generous rudder. The roll rate is quick because of the lively feel of the ailerons. Stall is predictable and recovery simple. In level flight as airspeed is reduced when approaching the stall speed the sailplane vibrate a little, at this point decreasing the angle of attack results in airspeed increase and normal flight resume, from a climbing attitude the sailplane stall decisively, the nose pitch down gently and recovery is easy with stick forward.

He is currently club chairman of Lega Pro club Ischia. Playing career After developing in the Ischia Isolaverde Youth Sector, Tagliatela transferred to the Napoli Youth Sector, and was promoted to the first team during the 1987‚Äì88 season, as the club's third-choice keeper, behind Claudio Garella and Raffaele Di Rusco, failing to make an appearance with the club. Taglialatela began his professional playing career while on loan with Palermo during the 1988‚Äì89 season, while they were in Serie C1; after appearing with Avellino in Serie B the following season, he began to gain attention from Serie A clubs. Taglialatela moved to his native club Napoli in 1990 during their peak, but played in only three games, making his Serie A debut on 6 January 1991, in a 1‚Äì0 away defeat to Juventus. After three loan spells at Serie B sides Palermo, Ternana, and Bari, he returned to Napoli, following Giovanni Galli's transfer to Torino, playing with the club from 1993 until 1999. On this occasion, he was finally able to break into the first team, and became the club's number one keeper for several years, as well as the club's captain in 1999, also attracting attention from larger clubs, including Inter, although he elected to remain with Napoli, despite the club's financial crisis. During his third stint with Napoli, he narrowly missed out on the Coppa Italia during the 1996‚Äì97 season, as Napoli lost the final to Vicenza. His later seasons with the club were less successful, as Napoli suffered Serie B relegation during the 1997‚Äì98 season, conceding numerous goals. =Fiorentina= After leaving Napoli, Taglialatela moved to Fiorentina for 5 billion lire in a co-ownership deal (‚Ç¨2.582 million),A.C.

The plans for the fortress included heavy coastal artillery pieces along the northern and southern shores of the Gulf of Finland. The emphasis was put on the defences of the gulf's narrowest point, between Porkkala, (in current day Finland) and Tallinn, (in current day Estonia). This was a strategic point, as the two fortresses of M√§kiluoto and Naissaar were only 36 kilometres apart. The coastal artillery had a range of about 25 kilometres and could thus \\"close\\" the gap between the shores, trapping enemy ships in a crossfire. Furthermore, a new major naval base was constructed in Tallinn. Purpose The decision to start construction of the naval fortress line came after the disastrous events at Tsushima, where the whole Russian Baltic Fleet had been annihilated. The road to Saint Petersburg was then unprotected and open. The quickest and cheapest way of dealing with this problem was to protect Saint Petersburg with a seemingly impenetrable zone of coastal artillery until a new fleet had been constructed. The idea was presented for the first time in 1907. Czar Nicholas II approved the plans on July 5, 1912, and the construction began soon thereafter. Defensive lines The system consisted of several zones of defence: # The innermost zone consisted of the fortresses at Kronstadt, Krasnaya Gorka and Ino, and the land and coastal fortresses near Vyborg. The latter were to prevent the enemy circling the Kronstadt line by landing near the Bay of Vyborg. # The second line was between Kotka and Narva, following the between-lying islands. # The third and main line of defence was between Tallinn and Porkkala. # The fourth line was between Hiiumaa and the Hanko Peninsula. Further, Helsinki and Tallinn were encircled with defensive lines on land, consisting of thousands of kilometers of railway, bunkers connected with tunnel systems, and cannon fire positions. The fortification around Helsinki, Krepost Sveaborg, was centered on the old fortress of Suomenlinna. The construction of the defensive system was slowed due to the outbreak of World War I. The naval fortress was only partly finished when both Finland and Estonia declared their independence, following the Russian October revolution. The German Navy performed one major landing operation on the shores of the Gulf of Finland during World War I. In April 1918, following a request from the Senate of Vaasa in Finland, the German Ostsee Division, led by R√ºdiger von der Goltz, landed in Hankoo, joined the Finnish Whites in the fight against the Reds, and conquered Helsinki. The heavy batteries of the Tallinn-Porkkala line 356 mm TM-1-14 railroad gun in WWII The heaviest batteries were supposed to consist of 356 mm/52 m 1913 guns.

The defense would be strengthened by minefields and patrolling submarines from the Finnish and Estonian navies. These plans were however nullified with the Soviet demands of air and naval bases in the Baltic States in 1939. The fortress in Porkkala, along with its 305 mm guns was leased to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Armistice of 1944. When the territory was returned to Finland in 1956, the guns were demolished.

It analyzes users in terms of the roles they play in relation to systems and employs abstract (essential) use casesSee Constantine (1995) and Constantine and Lockwood (2001) for task analysis. It derives visual and interaction design from abstract prototypes based on the understanding of user roles and task cases. Usage-centered design was introduced by Larry Constantine and Lucy Lockwood. The primary reference is their book.Constantine and Lockwood (1999); see also Constantine (1996) Usage-centered design methods Usage-centered design is largely based on formal, abstract models such as models of interaction between user roles, UML workflow models and task case and role profiles. Usage-centered design proponents argue for abstract modelling while many designers use realistic personas, scenarios and high-fidelity prototypes. The techniques have been applied with particular success in complex software projects, some of which have been reported in case studies.See, for example, Windl (2002) and Strope (2003) Usage-centered design and activity-centered design approach Usage- centered design share some common ideas with activity-centered design. It is concerned more with the activities of users but not the users per se.

Royal descent Danish historian J√∏rgen Nybo Rasmussen (Rasmussen 1974, 1986) has asserted that Jacob was a son (possibly extramarital) of King John of the Kalmar Union and a younger brother of King Christian II, both Danes. This has not been mentioned by all historians but is also the basis for a novel Brother Jacob by Danish author Henrik Stangerup. Key arguments in a case for Jacob's royal lineage are the facts that he described himself as coming from Gottorp, the estate of Kings Christian I and John of Denmark; that he had an excellent education normally reserved for the higher nobility; and that he seemed to enjoy the protection of higher political forces. It was also common for younger sons of royalty to enter into the clergy, since they normally would not inherit the thrones. Jacob's position as an inter-continental missionary would have been very unusual for a royal prince. A number of modern authors have counted Jacob ‚Äì or James ‚Äì as a Danish-Norwegian-Swedish prince and one of the legitimate children of King John and Queen Christina, but Rasmussen's thesis was also met with scepticism. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark visited his burial site, in respect to Jacob being a famous brother of one of her House of Oldenburg ancestors and predecessors, while on a state visit to Mexico in 2006. Life in Denmark until the Reformation Entering the Franciscan Order as a young man, Jacob received a good education studying Latin, Greek and Hebrew as well as his mother tongues German and Danish. In the years prior to the reformation he lived in a convent in Malm√∏ (now in Sweden), where he argued against the Lutheran leaders. In 1530 the Fransciscans were driven from the convent, as they were in the following from the other Danish towns. He described this in the Chronicle of the expulsion of the Greyfriars, written to serve as evidence in a potential trial to attempt to reclaim the convents later. Such a trial never came. During the religious wars known as the Count's Feud, fought between the supporters of his deposed brother, the Catholic King Christian II, and the forces of King Christian III of Denmark, many Franciscans left Denmark and went to Catholic provinces in northern Germany. Jacob stayed in Denmark until the fall of Malm√∏ in 1536 when the region's Lutheran Reformation was completed and the proscription of Mendicant orders forced him into exile. First he went to Mecklenburg under the protection of Duke Albrecht who had fought on the Catholic side in the civil war. Here he was made the last Provincial (head) of the Franciscan province of Dacia, whence his name. He subsequently went to Spain where he studied the Arabic language and was authorized by King Charles V of Spain to go to New Spain as a missionary. Missionary to Mexico In 1542, Brother Jacob arrived in Veracruz, and was to remain in New Spain for the rest of his life, learning several indigenous languages and founding several convents. He spent three years at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco studying Nahuatl before being sent to Michoac√°n to work among the Pur√©pecha, where the bulk of his missionary work was done. He learned the Pur√©pecha language and worked ardently to improve Indian rights, causing problems with the colonial authorities and with local church leadership, alike. He wrote a treatise, Declamacion del pueblo barbaro de los Indios, que habiendo recibido el bautismo, desean recibir los demas sacramentos, in which he argued that Indians should be allowed to be ordained into the priesthood. In this question he was overruled by church authorities and had to do penitence for these actions ‚Äì he had claimed that denying Indians the right to ordination was in fact tantamount to heresy, a standpoint which has been vindicated in the modern Roman Catholic Church. He died in the convent of Tar√©cuato, in the bishopric of Zamora where he had served as a guardian. Beginning in 1996, attempts have been made toward his canonization.

It is a charitable organisation that opened in October 2002. It is located in a terraced house in north London, and provides a one-off stay of five days and four nights for up to four guests at a time. Contact is generally severed following a stay, although help is provided for guests regarding their long-term wellbeing after Maytree.http://www.maytree.org.uk/arranging-stay.php Aims and objectives Maytree aims to support people in suicidal crisis. It provides a non medical environment where people who are feeling suicidal can rest, reflect and talk confidentially. The idea behind Maytree is that people who are in a suicidal crisis are able to come to a place where they can feel safe and secure, but also a place where they can talk through their problems. Maytree is a registered charity and provides this service at no cost. Maytree is intended to help those in a one-off suicidal crisis, as well as those that have longer term mental health problems. Its overall goal is to reduce suicide ideation. How Maytree works The Maytree model to suicide prevention is a therapeutic approach, based on the principle of befriending. =Befriending= The concept of befriending, a term originally used by The Samaritans, is a process based on a relationship of compassion and trust to facilitate changes in thoughts, feelings, understanding, intentions and actions that may lead to suicide. Befriending intends to enable another person to feel heard and valued. Ideally, the befriender discards assumptions, offers unconditional acceptance, compassion, empathy and concern, whilst respecting and encouraging the other's autonomy and sense of equality. The essence of befriending is the giving of undivided attention to the other, tuning in and connecting to mood and feelings, assimilating consciously and intuitively every aspect of the others presence. =Assessment of Suitability= All potential guests are assessed before an offer of stay is made. The process of assessment begins at the first contact, via an agency or a self-referral. Maytree accepts referrals from GPs, hospitals, psychotherapists, counsellors, friends, family and self-referrals, nationwide. Following a series of telephone conversations between potential guests and volunteers, a one=hour informal conversation will determine for both parties whether a stay is in everyone's best interests. Maytree is not for everyone so alternative options are explored for those who are not considered to benefit from a brief period of respite. =Characteristics of Maytree Guests= Maytree has had 300 guests in the period up to January 2007, the majority from London, but also from all over England.

He was a brother of Ferdinand VII, as well as the uncle and father- in-law of Isabella II. His education at the Spanish court was derailed by the Napoleonic intervention in Spain. The departure of the fourteen-year-old Infante to exile in May 1808 provoked a popular uprising that was violently suppressed by French troops. For the next ten years, Infante Francisco de Paula lived in exile with his parents, first in Marseille and later in Rome. Infante Francisco de Paula returned to Spain in 1818, being called by his eldest brother, King Ferdinand VII, who showered him with honors and privileges. Interested in artistic pursuits, Francisco was an amateur singer and painter. In 1819, he married his niece, Princess Luisa Carlotta of Naples and Sicily, the eldest daughter of his older sister Maria Isabella. The couple had eleven children and were very active in political affairs. Luisa Carlotta was instrumental in securing the succession for Ferdinand VII's daughter, Queen Isabella II. During the regency of Isabella II, Francisco was excluded from the government by his sister-in-law, Queen Maria Christina. Siding with the liberals, Francisco de Paula and his wife became active in the opposition and were forced to move to France in 1838. They returned to Spain under the government of Maria Christina's successor as regent, General Espartero. As they also conspired against Espartero, they were sent back into exile. The proclamation of Queen Isabella II's majority allowed them to return. The Infante and his wife centered their hopes on marrying their eldest son, Infante Francisco de Asis, to Queen Isabella II. Luisa Carlotta died in 1844, but, under pressure from French diplomacy, Queen Isabella II married Francisco de Asis in October 1846. As father-in-law to his niece the Queen, Infante Francisco de Paula occupied a prominent position at court during Isabella II's reign. However, as he tried to intervene in politics, he was briefly exiled once again in 1849. In 1852, with the Queen's approval, he contracted a morganatic marriage. He died twelve years later. Early life Infante Francisco de Paula by Francisco de Goya Born on 10 March 1794 at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, Infante Francisco de Paula was the fourteenth child of King Carlos IV of Spain (1748‚Äì1819) and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma (1751‚Äì1819), a granddaughter of King Louis XV of France.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 109. He received the names Francisco de Paula Antonio Maria. His parents had married twenty-nine years earlier and Francisco de Paula was the couple's last child. As the youngest in a large family, he was his mother's favorite.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 149 His father, King Carlos IV, had a passion for hunting and collecting clocks, but little interest in political affairs.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 110. He took a passive role in the direction of his own kingdom, leaving the government to his wife and to his prime minister, Manuel Godoy. Queen Maria Luisa thoroughly dominated the king. Lacking the political acumen necessary to hold power on her own, Maria Luisa deposited her trust and the rule of government on Godoy, whom she raised to prominence. Court rumors attributed the paternity of Francisco de Paula and his sister Maria Isabel, not to the king, but to Godoy. However, recent biographers and historians have found these claims to be both unproven and unlikely.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 259. As a child, Francisco de Paula had blond hair, brown eyes and a tender expression.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 111. In the spring 1800, at the age of six, he was painted with his family by Francisco Goya in the portrait Charles IV of Spain and His Family. Francisco de Paula's education was different from the one provided to his two eldest brothers Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias and Infante Don Carlos.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono, p. 150 The plan of studies assigned to him was inspired by the pedagogical theories of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Trying to implement this system of education throughout Spain, Godoy convinced the royal couple to apply it to their youngest son. Although his parents intended Francisco de Paula to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the Infante's education was abruptly interrupted by the Napoleonic intervention in Spain. With the pretext of solving the differences between Charles IV and his eldest son, Ferdinand VII, who took over the government after the Mutiny of Aranjuez, Napoleon invited father and son to a meeting in Bayonne, France, pressing them both to renounce the Spanish crown and give it to him.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 65. After achieving his objective, Napoleon gave Spain to his brother Joseph Bonaparte and ordered the remaining members of the Spanish royal family out of the country.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 112.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 131. While his parents and eldest brothers were at the conference in Bayonne with Napoleon, Francisco de Paula, then fourteen years old, was left behind at the Royal Palace of Madrid with his sister, the deposed Queen of Etruria, and her children. On 2 May 1808, at the departure of the Infante, the last remaining male member of royal family on Spanish soil, a crowd gathered in front of the Royal Palace in an attempt to prevent his removal. The appearance of Francisco de Paula, pale and overcome by emotion, touched the crowd. Poorly armed, the population confronted the French troops. The spontaneous popular uprising against the French invaders spread throughout Madrid, but the French General Murat brutally crushed the rebellion.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 256. Exile Infante Francisco de Paula in his teens For the next six years all the members of the Spanish royal family lived in exile. Ferdinand VII, his brother Infante Don Carlos and their uncle, old Infante Don Antonio, were confined under close surveillance at the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 112. Francisco de Paula, still a teenager, was the only child allowed to accompany his parents in exile in France.Mateos, That Sweet Young Infante, p. 199. King Carlos IV, the Queen and Infante Francisco de Paula, always followed by Godoy, were installed at the Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne to the north-east of Paris. Looking for a warmer climate, they moved to Marseille in October 1808.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 143. They spent the next four years there, under increasingly strained circumstances. The Infante's sister, the former Queen of Etruria, was imprisoned in a convent in Rome by Napoleon. In order to be closer to her ‚Äì and with fond memories of their early years in Naples and Parma ‚Äì Francisco de Paula's parents moved with him to Rome in July 1812. They settled at Palazzo Borghese. During the Hundred Days, following Napoleon's escape from Elba, Murat, who had been King of Naples since 1808, marched on Rome in the Emperor's name. The family fled to Verona. After Napoleon's final defeat, the Spanish royal party returned to Rome, moving to Palazzo Barberini.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 243. While in exile, Francisco de Paula's education was neglected. Godoy, who shared the same household with the deposed royal family, gave him some classes. In Rome, Francisco de Paula's parents tried to lead him to a career in the Church. He received minor orders, wore religious garments daily and the Pope offered to make him cardinal. However Francisco de Paula had no real inclination for clerical life. With no sibling near his age, Francisco's constant companion was Godoy's daughter, Carlota de Godoy Borbon, Duchess of Sueca. In 1814 Francisco de Paula was twenty years old and Carlota was fourteen. As they were fond of each other, Queen Maria Luisa wished them to marry. Francisco de Paula was reluctant. Unhappy with Godoy's overwhelming presence and the corruption around him, the Infante wrote to his brother the king, asking him to be permitted to renounce his religious orders, and be allowed to follow a career in the Spanish army instead.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 151 Ferdinand VII, restored to the Spanish throne after Napoleon's fall, called his brother back to Spain in order to frustrate the prospect of a wedding with Godoy's daughter. By August 1816, both Carlos IV and Queen Maria Luisa allowed their youngest son to leave as his behaviour in Rome had created concern.Smerdou, Carlos IV en el exilio , p. 272. The Infante left Rome on 22 November 1816. While in Lyon on his way to Spain, he became entangled in a scandal that derailed the trip. It was discovered that he had taken as lover the mistress of one of his servants, who took financial advantage of the situation. The Infante asked for forgiveness. Ferdinand VII pardoned his brother but delayed his return to Madrid, ordering him to travel around the European courts.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 152 For the next seventeen months the Infante visited Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Berlin, Weimar, Leipzig, Dresden, Prague, and Vienna. There were plans to marry him to a Princess of Saxony. In December 1817, Carlos IV proposed to marry Francisco to one of the twin daughters of the King of Bavaria.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 153 Neither of these two projects came to fruition. The Infante wanted to marry his niece, Princess Maria Luisa Carlota of Parma, then fourteen years old. However, the princess's mother, Maria Luisa (the former Queen of Etruria), opposed the union, considering her twenty-two-year-old brother too reckless for her young daughter. In March 1818, Ferdinand VII, pressed by his wife Isabel of Braganza, finally ordered his brother to return to Spain. Honours and privileges Princess Luisa Carlota of Bourbon Two Sicillies Infante Francisco de Paula returned to Spain in April 1818. Ferdinand VII did not allow his brother a position of command in the Spanish Army as Francisco had wished, but otherwise showered him with honors and privileges. The Infante was made a Knight of the orders of Santiago, Calatrava, Alcantara and Montesa, as well as being given the control and income of some of the large properties these orders held in Spain. He also became a senior knight of the orders of St John of Jerusalem which brought similar benefits. He received the French order of Saint Spirit and was made an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Arts. As Infante Francisco settled in the Royal Palace, his father, Carlos IV, shortly before his death, negotiated Francisco's marriage to Princess Luisa Carlotta of Bourbon Two Sicillies.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 154 This was with the consent of Ferdinand VII. Luisa Carlotta was the eldest daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain, Infante Francisco's sister.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 114. This was a union between uncle and niece. The couple married by proxy on 15 April 1819. On 14 May, Luisa Carlotta arrived in Barcelona. The ceremonial wedding took place on 9 June 1819 at the Royal Palace of Madrid. Francisco de Paula was twenty-five years old; Luisa Carlotta was only fifteen. She was lively, witty, strong willed, hot tempered and ambitious. Luisa Carlotta quickly dominated her husband, won the King's heart, and began to produce children who were granted the rank and status of Infantes of Spain.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 115. Between 1820 and 1834 the couple had eleven children. The family lived in a wing of the royal palace of Madrid and also spent periods of time at the palaces of la Granja, Aranjuez and Sevilla.Mateos, That Sweet Young Infante, p. 200. The position of Francisco de Paula and his wife at court was, however, a modest one. The Infante was only fifth in the line of succession‚Äîafter his brother Don Carlos and Don Carlos's three sons. Hoping to have descendants, Ferdinand VII, who had no children from his first two wives, married for a third time four months after Francisco's wedding. During the 1820s Spain was a country in constant political turmoil, facing economic hardships. The economy had been devastated in the war of independence from France and by the loss of the Spanish colonies in the continental Americas. A revolution in 1820 imposed on Ferdinand VII the liberal constitution of 1812. This period lasted for three years. In 1823, with the approval of Britain, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria, a French army invaded Spain and reinstated the King's absolute power. Constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives, who had the upper hand, continued. In this political struggle, Francisco de Paula, grateful, loyal and subservient to his brother the king, supported Ferdinand VII's conservative policies.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 155 However, as the infante's political views were moderate, the ultra-royalist party at court viewed him as a liberal.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono, p. 156Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 158 With a placid personality, Infante Francisco de Paula was more interested in art than in politics. The Infante, who in his childhood had received drawing lessons from the court painter and miniaturist Antonio Carnicero, was himself an amateur painter. Some of his works, including an oil painting of Saint Jerome, have survived. The Infante's main passion was music. Until he was forced to leave Spain for exile in 1808, he received music lessons from Pedro Anselmo Marchal and violin lessons from Francesco Vaccari.Lozano & Soto, La colecci√≥n de m√∫sica del infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n, p. 20 The Infante was a skillful singer with a good bass singing voice. His rooms at the Royal Palace were a gathering place for musicians and singers and he used to sing with them.Lozano & Soto, La colecci√≥n de m√∫sica del infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n, p. 23 The Infante also sang during musical evenings at the royal palace in the company of professional singers. From his youth until the end of his life, Francisco de Paula gathered an extensive sheet music collection that included almost 700 scores.Lozano & Soto, La colecci√≥n de m√∫sica del infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n, p. 33 This collection, acquired by the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a, has been preserved to this day.Lozano & Soto, La colecci√≥n de m√∫sica del infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n, p. 17 When Ferdinand VII created the Madrid Royal Conservatory in 1830, the infante was made an honorary member. Political struggles Infante Francisco de Paula by Bernardo L√≥pez Piquer King Ferdinand VII remained childless during the 1820s. His third wife, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony was barren. It was expected that his second brother, Infante Carlos, would succeed him. Religious and conservative, Don Carlos was married to the Portuguese Infanta Maria Francisca of Braganza. The couple had three sons. Infante Francisco de Paula supported his brothers's absolutist political views even if his own were more moderate liberal, but his energetic wife constantly dragged him into endless political struggles. Luisa Carlotta, although constantly pregnant, was meddlesome with a keen interest in government affairs.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 118. As she had a grudge against Maria Francisca and Maria Francisca's sister, Maria Teresa, Princess of Beira (widow of Francisco de Paula's cousin, Infante Pedro Carlos), Luisa Carlotta was determined to avoid Don Carlos becoming King after Ferdinand VII's death.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 159 The opportunity came with the death of Queen Maria Josepha in May 1829.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 117. On good terms with her brother in law Ferdinand VII, Luisa Carlotta convinced the king to marry her sister Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies. Their wedding took place in December that same year. The eldest of Ferdinand VII and Maria Christina's two daughters, Isabella, became heir to the crown thanks in great part to Luisa Carlotta's intervention. Don Carlos and his family opposed the change of the succession and they had to leave the country. Ferdinand VII died shortly after, on 29 September 1833. At the ascension to the Spanish throne of the three-year-old Isabella II of Spain, under the regency of Queen Maria Christina, Infante Francisco de Paula was disappointed at not being included in the new government. Three months after Ferdinand VII's death, Maria Christina secretly contracted a morganatic marriage with a sergeant from the royal guard. Luisa Carlotta quarreled with her sister over this marriage.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 119. Within months, Don Francsico and his wife began to conspire against the regent with the support of the liberals. Spain plunged into turmoil as Don Carlos and his ultra-royalist followers attempted to seize power by force, unleashing a civil war (1833 -1839). Maria Christina held on to power with the help of the moderates. She mistrusted her ambitious sister and when in 1837 Don Francisco claimed a place in the senate, Maria Christina refused to approve his appointment. This not only thwarted the Infante's appointment, but cemented the enmity between Luisa Carlotta and her sister, the Queen regent.Rubio, Reinas de Espa√±a, p. 508 Their relationship never recovered. For the next five years Francisco de Paula and his wife intrigued against Maria Christina, undermining her power. These political intrigues were such as that Maria Christina ordered Infante Francisco and his family to move abroad. Exiles and returns Infante Sebastian) In the spring 1838 Infante Francisco de Paula, his wife and their children settled in exile in France accompanied by the Infante's personal secretary the Count of Parcent. They found a prominent position at the court of Louis Philippe King of the French, whose wife Queen Maria Amelia, was an aunt of Infanta Luisa Carlotta. The Duchess of Dino who met Don Francisco de Paula and his family at the French court, described them as follows: \\" The Infanta is very fair, with a face which, though washed out, is none the less stern, with a rough manner of speaking. I felt very ill at ease with her, although she was very courteous. Her husband is red-haired and ugly, and the whole tribe of little infantes, boys and girls, are utterly detestable\\". Meanwhile, in Spain, General Espartero, credited for the victory over the Carlists in 1839, took the post of prime minister. He soon became virtually a dictator, and forced Queen Maria Cristina to resign the regency, sending her to exile in France in October 1840. Maria Cristina's fall from power opened the door for Infante Francisco de Paula return to Spain.Rubio, Reinas de Espa√±a, p. 519 Once back in Spain, Francisco de Paula and Luisa Carlotta initially settled in Burgos as Espartero banned them from approaching the capital. Eventually, the regent relented and allowed them to live in Madrid, but not in the Royal Palace. The couple hoped to exert influence over the Queen and foster their plan of marrying Isabella II and her sister, Infanta Luisa Fernanda to their sons Infantes Don Francisco de Asis and Don Enrique. When they tried to pressure Espartero in sanctioning the double marriages, he banished them to Zaragoza in August 1842.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 165 Arriving in Zaragoza in October 1842, the Infante and his wife were at the center of the opposition of Espartero's government. In November, the Infante's supporters tried to provoke a coup d'√©tat overthrowing the regency in favor of Don Francisco de Paula. When the plan was discovered, Espartero expelled the infante and his wife from Spain once again. However his new exile was short lived. In July 1843, a military upraising combined with a conspiracy of the moderates overthrew the regency. The rebels declared Queen Isabella of age, and Espartero went into exile in England.Rubio, Reinas de Espa√±a, p. 519 Infante Francisco returned to Madrid with his family. From then on they lived at their own residence, the Palace of San Juan, built in 1815 by Ferdinand VII, near the park of El Retiro. They also had a house in close proximity to the Royal Palace at No 40 La Luna street.Lozano & Soto, La colecci√≥n de m√∫sica del infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n, p. 25 On 29 January 1844, Luisa Carlotta died suddenly of measles, aged 39.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espana, p. 122. Widowed, Francisco de Paula continued living at the palace of San Juan. He wished to remarry and made a proposal to his sister-in-law and niece Princess Maria Carolina of the Two Sicilies, but the project did not come to fruition.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espana, p. 123. He renewed his efforts in his plan to marry his nieces to his two sons, but was not successful. However, under pressure of French diplomacy, Maria Cristina, who personally disliked his nephew Francisco de Asis, agreed to sanction the marriage of her daughter Queen Isabella to her cousin. Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France, was chosen as Infanta Luisa Fernanda's husband. The rejected Infante Don Enrique was involved in a conspiracy and had to go into exile. Last years Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain in old age As his son, Francisco de Asis, became king consort on 10 October 1846, Francisco de Paula's profile at court rose. He was well liked by Isabella II and one of his daughters, Infanta Josepha, became the Queen's best friend. However, the marriage between his son and his niece was an unhappy one. In 1849, Infante Francisco de Paula tried to intervene in an effort to reconcile the spouses. He sided with the Queen, but because at the same time he suggested her to form a cabinet with members of the progressive party, the moderate government expelled him from Spain. In 1850, he was allowed to return.Moral, El Infante don Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n: masoner√≠a y liberalismo a la sombra del trono , p. 166 Back in Spain, Infante Francisco de Paula was involved in a scandal.Mateos, The Sweet Young Infante, p. 202. He was found playing sexual games with two women while blindfolded.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 124. The women were sent away by the police. Eventually, at age fifty-eight, Francisco de Paula contracted a morganatic marriage on 19 December 1852 in Madrid.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 125. Little is known about his second wife, Teresa de Arredondo y Ramirez de Arellano, except that she was from Murcia and a good dancer. Her age is unknown, but she was much younger than her husband. She was not short of economical means as she brought into her marriage a considerable dowry. The couple had a son, Ricardo Mar√≠a de Arredondo, born a week after the wedding, on 26 December 1852.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 126. The child was not permitted to carry the Bourbon last name, instead he was given the title of Duke of San Ricardo by Isabella II in 1864. His second marriage lasted twelve years and was a happy one. In letters and documents, Infante Francisco de Paula praised his wife's devotion to him. They lived a discreet life at the palace of San Juan. Don Francisco de Paula appeared frequently in court events, but always without his wife. Do√±a Teresa died, still young, on 29 December 1863.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 127. Their eleven-year-old son, Ricardo Mar√≠a, was put under the care of his maternal grandmother. In his will, Infante Francisco de Paula tried to protect his youngest son's inheritance and placed him under the custody of Queen Isabella II. Less than a year after his second widowhood, Infante Francisco de Paula died of colon cancer on 13 August 1865. He had wished to be buried at the church of San Francisco, but he was buried at the Escorial as was due a person of his rank. Marriages and children Francisco de Paula married twice. His first wife was his niece Princess Luisa Carlotta of Naples and Sicily, daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain. They married on 12 June 1819 in Madrid and had eleven children. * Francisco de Asis de Borb√≥n, Infante of Spain (6 May 1820 - 15 November 1821) * Isabel de Borb√≥n, Infanta of Spain (1821-1897); married, morganatically, Count Ignaz Gurowski * Francisco de Asis de Borb√≥n, Duke of C√°diz, king-consort of Spain (13 May 1822 - 16 April 1902).

Background The party was founded after Shmuel Flatto-Sharon had fled to Israel from France in 1976 after being charged with embezzling $60 million. In order to prevent his extradition, which France had requested, and despite hardly speaking Hebrew, he decided to run in the 1977 Knesset elections, hoping to gain parliamentary immunity. Named after himself, Flatto-Sharon's party ran on right-wing populism (he was a supporter of the Gush Emunim settlement movement) and promises to provide apartments to young voters. The new party won 2% of the vote, enough for two seats. However, as it was a one- man list, only one seat was taken. It has been suggested that the surprising level of support that the party won was a response to France's refusal to extradite Abu Daoud, who was wanted in Israel for the murder of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich. Once ensconced in the Knesset, Flatto-Sharon joined Menachem Begin's coalition, with one of his first acts being to vote in favour of a law that prohibited the extradition of Israeli citizens. Later during the Knesset session he renamed the party Development and Peace and also helped in negotiations to free Israeli POWs. However, after serving for two years, Flatto-Sharon was convicted of vote buying, sentenced to nine months in prison and suspended from the Knesset. After several appeals, he was finally jailed for three months in 1984. The party ran in the 1981 and 1984 elections, but did not pass the electoral threshold of 1% in either, and subsequently disappeared. Flatto-Sharon was never extradited to France to serve the five- year sentence given to him in his absence, as the five-year statute of limitations had expired. He was an established businessman and billionaire until his death in 2018.

A moving group, in astronomy, is a group of stars that share a common motion through space as well as a common origin. This moving group is named for Beta Pictoris. The Beta Pictoris Moving Group is an important object for astronomical study as it is the closest youthful group of stars to the Earth. The star Beta Pictoris is known to have a large disk of gas and dust, possibly a protoplanetary disk. There is also evidence of a young gas giant planet around the star. A free-floating planet has also been found in the moving group, PSO J318.5-22. The age and distance of the group makes it a candidate for directly imaging extrasolar planets. Constituents The Beta Pictoris Moving Group consists of 17 stellar systems, comprising a total of 28 individual component stars, including identified brown dwarfs. The core of the group is located some 115 light-years from Earth, and has an average estimated age of between 20 and 26 million years. The majority of the group is made up of cool, dim K and M class stars. Most are not visible to the naked eye. The members that are visible to the naked eye are: *Beta Pictoris *Eta Telescopii *51 Eridani *HD 203 *HD 146624 *HD 165189 *HD 172555 *Beta Trianguli Australis The group covers a region of space for the most part visible only in the Southern Hemisphere, and lies in the constellations Eridanus, Lepus, Pictor, Scorpius, Fornax, Triangulum Australe and Telescopium. Discovery An early estimated age for the star Beta Pictoris at about 10 million years proved problematic due to the star's apparent isolation in space. According to current theory regarding stellar evolution, extremely young stars of this age should be located near other young stars that formed from the same region in space. It is not until significantly later that gravitational interactions with other stars causes stellar 'siblings' to disperse. In 1999 the situation was resolved by the discovery of a pair of dim red dwarf stars that were found to have a similar velocity and age to Œ≤ Pictoris, lending credence to the estimated age of the star. Further work published in 2001 identified a total of 17 stellar systems with a similar motion and age as the Beta Pictoris moving group, named for the primary member of the association. Origin The movements of the group were tracked to the positions they occupied 11.5Myr ago, where they occupied a space 3 times smaller than their current distribution (24pc, versus 72pc today) situated in between two regions of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB star group, and it was suggested that they originated there when a supernova from either OB region of Scorpius-Centaurus OB would have been close enough to trigger stellar formation.

In the monohalides the oxidation state of indium is +1 and their proper names are indium(I) fluoride, indium(I) chloride, indium(I) bromide and indium(I) iodide. The intermediate halides contain indium with oxidation states, +1, +2 and +3. Indium trihalides In all of the trihalides the oxidation state of indium is +3, and their proper names are indium(III) fluoride, indium(III) chloride, indium(III) bromide, and indium(III) iodide. The trihalides are Lewis acidic. Indium trichloride is a starting point in the production of trimethylindium which is used in the semiconductor industry. =Indium(III) fluoride= InF3 is a white crystalline solid with mp 1170 ¬∞C. Its structure contains 6 coordinate indium. =Indium(III) chloride= InCl3 is a white crystalline solid mp 586 ¬∞C. It has the same structure as AlCl3. =Indium(III) bromide= InBr3 is a pale yellow crystalline solid, m.p. 435 ¬∞C. It has the same structure as AlCl3. InBr3 is finding some use in organic synthesis as a water tolerant Lewis acid.Zhan-Hui Zhang Thieme Connect Synlett 2005 711 =Indium(III) iodide= Ball-and-stick model of the In2I6 molecule InI3 is a coloured crystalline solid, usually described as orange. Distinct yellow and a red forms are known. The red form undergoes a transition to the yellow at 57 ¬∞C. The structure of the red form has not been determined by X-ray crystallography, however spectroscopic evidence indicates that indium may be six coordinate.Taylor M. J., Kloo L. A. Journal of Raman Spectroscopy 31, 6, (2000), 465 The yellow form consists of In2I6 with 4 coordinate indium centres. It is used as an \\"iodide getter\\" in the Cativa process. Intermediate halides A surprising number of intermediate chlorides and bromides are known, but only one iodide, and no difluoride. Rather than the apparent oxidation state of +2, these compounds contain indium in the +1 and +3 oxidation states. Thus the diiodide is described as InIInIIIX4. It was some time later that the existence of compounds containing the anion In2 were confirmed which contains an indium- indium bond. Early work on the chlorides and bromides involved investigations of the binary phase diagrams of the trihalides and the related monohalide. Many of the compounds were initially misidentified as many of them are incongruent and decompose before melting. The majority of the previously reported chlorides and bromides have now either had their existence and structures confirmed by X Ray diffraction studies or have been consigned to history. Perhaps the most unexpected case of mistaken identity was the surprising result that a careful reinvestigation of the InCl/InCl3 binary phase diagram did not find InCl2.Meyer G., Blachnik R.Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 1983, 503, 126 The reason for this abundance of compounds is that indium forms 4 and 6 coordinate anions containing indium(III) e.g. In, In as well as the anion In2 that surprisingly contains an indium-indium bond. =In7Cl9 and In7Br9= In7Cl9 is yellow solid stable up to 250 ¬∞C that is formulated InI6(InIIICl6)Cl3H.P.

G.,Z Anorg Allgem Chem 552 9 113 =In4Br7= In4Br7 is near colourless with a pale greenish yellow tint. It is light sensitive (like TlCl and TlBr) decaying to InBr2 and In metal. It is a mixed salt containing the In and In anions balanced by In+ cations. It is formulated InI5(InIIIBr4)2(InIIIBr6) The reasons for the distorted lattice have been ascribed to an antibonding combination between doubly filled, non-directional indium 5s orbitals and neighboring bromine 4p hybrid orbitals.R.Dronskowski, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 34 (1995) 1126. =In5Cl9= In5Cl9 is formulated as InI3InIII2Cl9.

InBr2 is soluble in aromatic solvents and some compounds containing Œ∑6-arene In(I) complexes have been identified. (See hapticity for an explanation of the bonding in such arene-metal ion complexes). With some ligands InBr2 forms neutral complexes containing an indium-indium bond.Sinclair I., Worrall I.J Can. J. Chem./Rev. can. chim. 60(6): 695-698 (1982) = InI2= InI2 is a yellow solid that is formulated InIInIIII4. Monohalides The solid monohalides InCl, InBr and InI are all unstable with respect to water, decomposing to the metal and indium(III) species. They fall between gallium(I) compounds, which are more reactive and thallium(I) that are stable with respect to water. InI is the most stable. Up until relatively recently the monohalides have been scientific curiosities, however with the discovery that they can be used to prepare indium cluster and chain compounds they are now attracting much more interest. =InF= InF only known as an unstable gaseous compound. =InCl= The room temperature form of InCl is yellow, with a cubic distorted NaCl structure.J.M.

C61, 200 Anionic halide complexes of In(III) The trihalides are Lewis Acids and form addition compounds with ligands. For InF3 there are few examples known however for the other halides addition compounds with tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral coordination geometries are known. With halide ions there are examples of all of these geometries along with some anions with octahedrally coordinated indium and with bridging halogen atoms, In2 with three bridging halogen atoms and In2 with just one. Additionally there are examples of indium with square planar geometry in the InX52‚àí ion. The square planar geometry of In was the first found for a main group element. =In and In= Salts of In, In and In are known.

It was published every two months, with the first issue going on sale in May 2007. Typical issues were 132 pages, perfect bound, on glossy paper. History Death Ray was created by Matt Bielby, the ex-Future Publishing staff member who was editor on some of that company's significant titles, including Total Film magazine and SFX magazine, the dominant SF title. Death Ray is published by Blackfish Publishing, Bielby's magazine company, based in Bath, UK. At their launches in 2007 Death Ray and SciFiNow, launched April 2007, were the first magazines in recent years to challenge SFX's dominance of the science fiction magazine market in the UK Issue 6, The New Kids on the Block , Pages 11-15, Hub Magazine (11 May 2007), Retrieved 6 December 2007 but neither has yet to approach SFX in terms of popularity or sales. (A UK version of the American science fiction magazine Starlog was published for a couple years beginning in May 2000.) However, the magazine has been described by one source as wordier and offering greater depthSF Diplomat: REVIEW - Death Ray Magazine (Issue One) than its two main competitors. In August 2008, Blackfish Publishing announced it had been bought by Rebellion Developments, the video game producer who already publish 2000 AD and Abaddon Books.

Name Bielby has said that the magazine's name is influenced by a combination of a) the name of the influential 1990s Californian music magazine Ray Gun, b) the name of the Martian 'heat-ray' weapon from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (1898), c) the single issue story 'The Death Ray' from Daniel Clowes' Eightball comic book, d) an Australian comic book from WW2 called The Death Ray, and e) issue 64 of Marvel Comics' The Mighty Avengers, '...Like a Death Ray From the Sky!'

Physical wealth, as in wealth that comes from the ground is not portable, which means it can easily be taxed, or worse, expropriated. His most recent book, A World of ChanceReuven Brenner, Gabrielle A. Brenner and Aaron Brown, A World of Chance: Betting on Religion, Games, Wall Street. Cambridge University Press (2008). argues that at one time gambling fulfilled roles performed by venture capital and banking today, and that modern financial institutions retain a strong gambling core. The book shows how people dealt with uncertainty and risk since antiquity; how they rationalized a variety of beliefs and institutions that made it appear that decisions had some solid backing; and how people in fact made decisions on a variety of issues linked to finance, gambling, insurance, religion and politics. In his 2002 book, Force of Finance,Reuven Brenner, Force of Finance: Triumph of the Capital Markets. Texere (2002). Brenner notes that economic success in certain countries often results from \\"political blunders of other nations,\\" that lead \\"to the rapid outflow of both capital and talented people.\\" The book also discusses the various monetary policy options, pointing out the flaws in inflation rate targeting and floating exchange rates, and suggests that economists have misunderstood the proper role of gold. Brenner also integrates his views about democratization of capital markets and entrepreneurship with issues such as nationalism and tolerance, as well as with details about political institutions that can best maintain accountability, illustrating the latter with Swiss' unique \\"direct democracy.\\" In addition to Force of Finance, Reuven Brenner is the author of seven other books. Labyrinths of ProsperityReuven Brenner, Labyrinths of Prosperity: Economic Follies, Democratic Remedies. University of Michigan Press (1994). helps to explain among other things why the Dutch are seen as frugal, why education spending rose in the United States after 1958, and why Russians refrained from buying apartments there after the U.S.S.R.'s collapse. For the macro-focused, he points out that statistics such as GDP sustain \\"the illusion that prosperity is necessarily linked with territory, national units, and government spending in general.\\" In Gambling and SpeculationReuven Brenner and Gabrielle A. Brenner, Gambling and Speculation: A Theory, a History, and a Future of some Human Decisions. Cambridge University Press (1990). Brenner makes an argument for gambling legalization. He uses history and theory to cover measures of risk taking, noting that risk-taking that is a daily part our lives. In Educating Economists,David Colander and Reuven Brenner, Educating Economists. University of Michigan Press (1992). Brenner and co-author David Colander discuss ways to improve the training of future economists. In the chapter Making Sense out of Nonsense, Brenner discusses what's wrong with the social sciences and academia today, and in two other chapters focusing on the main courses being taught in economics either being empty of content, or wrong. Rivalry: In Business, Science, Among NationsReuven Brenner, Rivalry: In Business, Science, Among Nations. Cambridge University Press (1990). posits a theory of business enterprise that suggests risks are taken as a way to be outranked by one's peers in the hierarchical sense. The book also deals with antitrust, state owned enterprises, and advertising, showing how the latter saves significant search costs, and how recommendations of family and friends (the non-digital ones of the 1980s) were a good substitute for advertising.

He was notable for his contributions of ethnographic and typological studies of the indigenous peoples of Botswana and South Africa. Additionally, he was one of the founders of the group that would develop British social anthropology. Not only did Schapera write numerous publications Heald Suzette, \\"Isaac Schapera: A Bibliography\\", Pula: Botswana Journal of African Studies Vol. 12 No. 1 & 2 (1998) 100-115, of his extensive research done in South Africa and Botswana, he published his work throughout his career (1923‚Äì1969), and even after he retired. As an anthropologist he focused on the lives and customs of the indigenous peoples of South Africa and was considered to be a specialist in the topic. Early in his career he would focus on studies of the Khoisan of South Africa until the 1930s, when he would begin to focus on Tswana of Botswana. Schapera also received many honours and titles, such as being the president of the Royal Anthropology Institute.Schapera Isaac, Picturing a Colonial Past; The African Photographs by Isaac Schapera, ed. Comaroff et al. (University of Chicago; 2007). Additionally, he was awarded an honorary doctorate when the University of Botswana was founded in 1985, was elected as Chair of the Association of Social Anthropology, and the Journal of African Law was founded in his honour. To compile his work for future generations and note his anthropological contributions a bibliography was published in the Botswana Journal of African African Studies.Heald Suzette, \\"Isaac Schapera: A Bibliography\\", Pula: Botswana Journal of African Studies Vol. 12 No. 1 & 2 (1998) 100-115. This academic journal has also dedicated an entire issue to the work he had done throughout his career. In 2003 his obituary was published in the academic journal Anthropology Today, titled \\"The Legacy of Isaac Schapera\\".Heald Suzette, \\"The Legacy of Isaac Schapera\\", Anthropology Today Vol. 19 No. 6, (December 2003) 18-19. In the wake of his death, photographs he had taken of South Africa were published in a book Picturing a Colonial Past; The African Photographs by Isaac Schapera and the Recovering the Botswana project would be dedicated to him. Life, education, and career Schapera was born in Garies, Namaqualand, South Africa where his father owned a general store. In his youth he attended school, and later university, in Cape Town, South Africa. During his early university career he was enrolled in law, but would later switch to anthropology. He was a student of Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown, who is considered a founder of structural-functionalism theory in anthropology.Schapera Isaac, Picturing a Colonial Past; The African Photographs by Isaac Schapera, ed. Comaroff et al (University of Chicago; 2007). After finishing his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in anthropology, Schapera completed his doctorate at the London School of Economics and Politics (LSE) where he would be influenced by Bronislaw Malinowski. Thereafter he taught briefly at the University of Witwatersrand before returning to Cape Town. There he worked as a professor of social anthropology before joining the Department of Anthropology at LSE. His continued to work there until he retired in 1969. Schapera's students would include future important figures of anthropology, such as Eileen Krige, Hilda Kuper, Max Gluckman, John Comaroff, Johan Frederik Holleman and Jean Comaroff. After his death, a research program called \\"Recovering the Schapera Project\\" was carried out by the University of Botswana to build upon Schapera's research. As a professor he was noted by Kuper as \\"not being an inspiring lecturer, but [having] wonderful material\\". Schapera's life was his work, and he never married. In his later years, Schapera rarely returned to the place of his studies, but did return to Botswana to receive the honorary degree awarded to him by the University of Botswana.Schapera Isaac, Picturing a Colonial Past; The African Photographs by Isaac Schapera, ed. Comaroff et al. (University of Chicago; 2007) Additionally, because of the damages to his vocal cords caused by surgery, he withdrew from socializing, though he maintained contact with students to stay up to date with ongoing anthropological studies. His legacy \\"Recovering the Schapera Project\\" is the continuation of the extensive research made by Schapera of the people of Botswana. His style of recording and studying was applied to all aspects of life Heald Suzette, \\"The Legacy of Isaac Schapera,\\" Anthropology Today Vol. 19 No. 6, (December 2003) 18-19. and thus resulted in a wealth of unpublished material. This material includes unpublished genealogies, history, and other culturally significant data. The Shapera Project is funded by the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Botswana for the university overtook assessing this data and building upon it after Schapera's death. Published material He published numerous journal articles, nearly 200, as mentioned in the academic Journal of African Studies, which published a bibliography in 1998. Notable titles include: \\"The Khoisan Peoples of South Africa\\" (Schapera; 1930), \\"A Handbook of Tswana Law and Custom\\" (Schapera; 1938), \\"Married Life in an African Tribe\\" (Schapera; 1940), \\"The Ethnic Composition of Tswana Tribes\\" (Schapera; 1952); \\"The Tswana\\" (Schapera; 1953), \\"Government and Politics in Tribal Societies\\", (Schapera; 1956), \\"Praise Poems of Tswana Chiefs\\" (Schapera; 1965), \\"David Livingstone's Journals and Letters\\" (Schapera; 1841‚Äì1856 (6 vols), 1959‚Äì1963), \\"David Livingstone: South African papers\\" (Schapera; 1849‚Äì1853, 1974).

A pupil of Xenocrates, he believed that philosophy should be practiced rather than just studied, and he placed the highest good in living according to nature. Life Polemon was the son of Philostratus, a man of wealth and political distinction. In his youth, he was relatively irresponsible, but one day, when he was about thirty, on his bursting into the school of Xenocrates, at the head of a band of revelers, his attention was drawn to the sayings of Xenocrates, who continued on calmly in spite of the interruption; it just so happened that Xenocrates was discussing temperance. Polemon immediately tore off his garland and remained an attentive listener, and from that day he adopted a modest and restrained course of life, and continued to frequent the school. On the death of Xenocrates, he even became the scholarch, in 315 BC. His disciples included Crates of Athens, who was his eromenos, and Crantor, as well as Zeno of Citium and Arcesilaus. According to Eusebius (Chron.) he died in 270/269 BC (or possibly, as in some manuscripts, 276/275 BC). Diogenes La√´rtius says that he died at a great age, and of natural decay. Crates was his successor in the Academy. Philosophy Diogenes reports that he was a close follower of Xenocrates in all things. He esteemed the object of philosophy to be to exercise people in things and deeds, not in dialectic speculations; his character was grave and severe; and he took pride in displaying the mastery which he had acquired over emotions of every sort. In literature he most admired Homer and Sophocles, and he is said to have been the author of the remark, that Homer is an epic Sophocles, and Sophocles a tragic Homer. Writings According to Diogenes La√´rtius, Polemon wrote several treatises, of which none were extant when the Suda was compiled. There is, however, a quotation made by Clement of Alexandria, either from Polemon or from another philosopher of the same name, \\"in Concerning the Life in Accordance with Nature\\" (),Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, vii. p. 117 and another passage,Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, ii. p. 410 upon happiness, which agrees precisely with the statement of Cicero,Cicero, de Finibus, iv. 6 that Polemon placed the summum bonum (highest good) in living according to the laws of nature.

The screenplay by George Zuckerman is based on the 1935 novel Pylon by William Faulkner. Plot Disillusioned World War I flying ace Roger Shumann (Robert Stack) spends his days during the Great Depression making appearances as a barnstorming pilot at rural airshows with his parachutist wife LaVerne (Dorothy Malone), worshipful son Jack (Chris Olsen), and mechanic Jiggs (Jack Carson) in tow. New Orleans reporter Burke Devlin (Rock Hudson) is intrigued by the gypsy-like lifestyle of the former war hero, but is dismayed by his cavalier treatment of his family and soon finds himself attracted to the neglected LaVerne. Meanwhile, Roger barters with wealthy and aging business magnate Matt Ord (Robert Middleton) for a plane in exchange for a few hours with his wife. Tragedy ensues when Jiggs' anger about his employer's refusal to face family responsibilities causes him to make a rash and fatal decision. He manages to start Shumann's aircraft, with some difficulty, but the plane crashes and Shumann is killed. After rejecting and then reconciling with Devlin, LaVerne returns to Iowa with son Jack.

Stack and Malone played brother and sister in their previous appearance together, with Malone's character infatuated with Hudson's. Sirk chose to shoot Angels in black-and-white to help capture the despondent mood of the era in which it is set. Faulkner considered the film to be the best screen adaptation of his work.William Faulkner at the Special Collections Library of the University of Michigan Critical reception The film premiered in London in November 1957 and got its first American date on Christmas Day 1957 in Charlotte, North Carolina, before going into general release in January.IMDb entryMotion Picture Daily In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther said the film \\"was badly, cheaply written by George Zuckerman and is abominably played by a hand-picked cast. The sentiments are inflated ‚Äî blown out of all proportions to the values involved. And the acting, under Douglas Sirk's direction, is elaborate and absurd.\\" Variety called the film \\"a stumbling entry. Characters are mostly colorless, given static reading in drawn-out situations, and story line is lacking in punch.\\" More recent reviews, penned after a resurgence of interest and respect for Sirk's directing, are uniformly positive. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100. Dave Kehr writes in The New York Times: \\"'The Tarnished Angels' is among Sirk‚Äôs most self-conscious and artistically ambitious creations.... This is bravura filmmaking in the service of a haunting vision. Yet there are moments of almost microscopic subtlety: the camera movement that expresses the moral reversal of the Hudson and Stack characters, one growing larger than the other; the infinite tenderness with which Hudson strokes Ms. Malone‚Äôs hair, helplessly trying to comfort her after a shock.\\" TV Guide rates it four out of a possible four stars and calls it \\"the best-ever adaptation of a Faulkner novel for the screen, directed with passion and perception by Sirk . . . The acting is first-rate here, and the script is outstanding, full of wit, black humor, and occasional fine poetic monologues.\\" See also * List of American films of 1957 References  External links   American films American aviation films Films about journalists Films set in the 1930s 1957 drama films American black-and-white films English-language films Films directed by Douglas Sirk Universal Pictures films Films based on American novels Films based on works by William Faulkner Films scored by Frank Skinner ","title":"The Tarnished Angels"},{"id":"9734327","text":"Ben Patrick (born August 23, 1984) is an American football tight end who is currently a coach at Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe, Arizona.

The battle was one of the rare examples of an American armoured force being repulsed by a screen of Iraqi entrenched infantry, APCs, and Iraqi T-72 tanks during Desert Storm. The incident also involved American friendly fire casualties. Background The initial skirmishes between American and Iraqi Republican Guard units took place earlier that day around pre-established line 73 Easting, some 30 miles west of Wadi al Batin, where the 2 ACR managed to destroy two Iraqi armoured brigades. The skirmishes in this sector were still going on when the 3rd Armoured Division, positioned north, made the first contact with a brigade of the Tawakalna Armoured Division around 03:30pm. Weather conditions were extremely poor, hampering visibility and identification of targets. Flank screen maneuver As the usual practice for armored reconnaissance, a troop of M3 Bradleys (Alpha Troop), belonging to the 4th Squadron of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, was scouting ahead of the main tank force. The flank screen maneuver took place along the southern boundaries between the 2 ACR and 3rd Armored Division operational areas. Task Forces 4-34 and 4-32 were advancing from the rear. The general movement of the US forces followed an eastward direction. The fumes from hundreds of oil wells set on fire by the Iraqis, combined with an intense shamal, forced the US vehicles to use thermal sights.Atkinson, p. 431 Surprising contact At 03:00pm, the reconnaissance troop of 14 Bradleys received information from the GHQ of the 3rd Armoured Division that no enemy unit remained between them and the Kuwaiti border. Suddenly, they found a screen line of Iraqi APCs straight ahead, barely to the east. The poor weather, along with burning oil fumes, reduced the visibility conditions to almost zero. The enemy screen line was part of the 9th Armored Brigade of Tawakalna Division. Tanks from 3rd Armored Division Brigade along the Line of Departure A burst of small-arms and heavy machine gunfire, RPGs and Sagger missiles erupted. Initially, the American commander thought they were engaging dismounted infantry supported by BMPs, but later he realized that they were also receiving main-gun tank rounds.See this official sketch of the Iraqi screen line The US vehicles retaliated by firing TOW missiles, 25 mm cannon and machine guns. The contact lasted for about two hours, until the Bradleys, battered by enemy and friendly fire and running out of ammunition, were forced to withdraw.Atkinson, p. 433 American M1 Abrams tanks from TF 4-34, positioned in the rear echelon, fired in support of the IFVs, destroying at least one T-72 and several Iraqi APCs. They also hit three Bradleys (A-24, A-31 and A-22), causing two American deaths.See this official report (scan) The 2 ACR also became entangled in the fighting from the rear right.

As we were shifting, my loader was reloading a TOW missile. When we took up position, we engaged another BMP and a tank. We were getting low on ammo, so I told my driver to pivot so we could reload. I realized we were still up front so we started backing up. It sounded like we lost a track, so I told him to stop. As soon as we stopped, we took a round in the transmission. Later, we found out it was from a 12.7-mm machine gun.\\"Bin, Hill and Jones, page 195, according to a more detailed account by Sgt Jones: *\\"The weather was bad, and I couldn't see anything without the thermal sights.

She was put on trial in S√£o Paulo in July 2006 and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Life Suzane von Richthofen is the daughter of German engineer Manfred Albert von Richthofen and Lebanese-Brazilian psychiatrist Marisia von Richthofen (n√©e Mar√≠sia S√≠lvia Abdalla). √öltimo Segundo Manfred was a director of DERSA, a state-owned company which manages S√£o Paulo's highway system, and the chief engineer for the M√°rio Covas beltway project. Suzane has a younger brother, Andreas Albert von Richthofen. After graduating from a German high school, Suzane studied law at the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo. In the summer of 1999, she started attending a Brazilian jiu- jitsu class and met Daniel Cravinhos de Paula e Silva, who became her boyfriend. Suzane's family had a declared net worth of R$5.5 million. However, prosecutors suspect that two anonymous accounts in Swiss banks, containing at least ‚Ç¨10 million, were opened by Suzane's father in her name in November 2001, when she turned 18. Manfred von Richthofen is thought to have embezzled this money from DERSA. Because the accounts are in Suzane's name, nothing prevents her from gaining access to the money after serving her sentence.\\"Feliz anivers√°rio, Suzane!\\" Isto√© Brasil 15 November 2006 \\"Promotor faz revela√ß√µes exclusivas sobre o caso Richthofen\\" redetv.com.br 31 October 2012 Murder In the late hours of October 31, 2002, Suzane von Richthofen, who had planned the murder of her parents for months, checked if they were already asleep, then disconnected the alarm system of the estate and opened the door to her 21-year-old-boyfriend, Daniel Cravinhos and his brother, 26-year-old Christian Cravinhos, who had been waiting outside. The Cravinhos brothers went upstairs to the parents' bedroom and hit them with iron bars before strangling them with towels. Suzane was waiting in the living room downstairs. After the murder was accomplished, the three simulated a break-in by pocketing money they found, spreading papers in the library, and creating a mess in the house. Then they left; Suzane and Daniel went to a motel, while Christian went to a fast-food restaurant. Early in the morning, Suzane and Daniel picked up her little brother, Andreas, then aged 15, at an internet cafe and went home, where they \\"discovered\\" the crime, called the police at once and told them their story. The investigating officers, however, doubted that the crime was a burglary and suspected that the perpetrators were known to the victims; they soon began to question the children and the employees of the Richthofen family. What made them suspicious was not only the crime scene, with the alarm system switched off and the papers spread very regularly, as if by design, but also Suzane's extraordinarily cold behavior ‚Äì she was seen in the house's swimming pool with Daniel the day after the murder, and celebrated her 19th birthday with friends just hours after the parents' burial. The investigators focused their attention on Suzane and her boyfriend and began shadowing them. The clue for the arrest came with Christian Cravinhos, who had bought a motorcycle a few days later and paid cash in 100-dollar bills. A few days later, on November 9, 2002 he was arrested, as well as his brother and Suzane, who soon confessed to the murder. Suzane was released from prison in May 2005, when the Supreme Court of Justice granted her habeas corpus. She then awaited her trial under house arrest. Motives Suzane's parents, who at first allowed her relationship to Daniel Cravinhos, changed their opinion when they discovered that he used marijuana almost daily. Also, his lower- class background and his unwillingness to work or to attend school caused their disagreement. In July, 2002, her parents were on vacation, so Daniel moved in with the children for a month, much to Suzane's delight. When the parents came back home, Suzane suggested they buy her a flat in which she could live with Daniel, but her father refused, saying that she could do whatever she liked to only if she earned money herself. She continued meeting Daniel secretly. Suzane claimed that she did all for love, for fear that Daniel would leave her if the parents were not killed.\\"Suzane von Richthofen muss wegen Elternmordes hinter Gitter\\" Handelsblatt Her lawyer, Denivaldo Barni, said that Suzane had no motive at all, but was forced to the crime by Daniel, whom she adored like a god. Another part of the motive may have been the parents' wealth, estimated at about seventeen million dollars, which Suzane would inherit in the event of the parents' death. As Prosecutor Roberto Tardelli put it, Suzane wanted to \\"get her hands on the money and assets her parents had worked so hard to obtain\\"; she \\"wanted her freedom and independence without having to work for it\\". On trial, Daniel Cravinhos claimed that Suzane was physically violated by her father, which she and her brother Andreas von Richthofen deny. It was also claimed that the Richthofen parents were alcoholics, but in the autopsy no alcohol was detected in their bodies. In 2018, a justice denied request of freedom for von Richthofen, citing her egocentrism and a narcissistic personality disorder as serious personality traits that may have led to her crime. Trial On June 5, 2006, Suzane von Richthofen, along with the Cravinhos brothers, was put on trial in S√£o Paulo for homic√≠dio qualificado, the equivalent of First Degree Murder in Brazilian law. The trial was delayed and finally started on July 17. On trial, Suzane blamed Daniel Cravinhos for everything, while the Cravinhos brothers claimed that they acted on her wishes. Prosecutor Roberto Tardelli, however, called Suzane the \\"mastermind\\" of the crime. Roberto Tardelli called for 50 years imprisonment for each of the three defendants. Suzane was described as a \\"personification of the evil blonde\\". On July 22, 2006, Suzane was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the crime. Daniel Cravinhos got the same sentence and his brother Christian was sentenced to 38 years for conspiracy. , she is in custody in a women's prison outside S√£o Paulo. Brazilian public attention The case generated significant media attention in Brazil due to the stark contrast between the brutal crime and what was initially perceived to be the personality of the daughter. While the Cravinhos brothers fit the stereotype of the uneducated, unemployed, drug-addicted killers, this was not true for Suzane: She was a pretty girl from an upper-middle-class family of German and Lebanese descent, \\"well-behaved\\", always doing well at school, speaking three foreign languages and doing ballet. A discussion emerged in the Brazilian public about the worth of family values and the effects of education: Does a high standard of education and high class status lead to good character? The question as to whether Suzane was the evil mind behind the crime or just Daniel's tool was also widely discussed. Many people who initially were emotionally on Suzane's side, changed their opinion when a TV interview with her was shown. Before the interview, when the cameras were already on, she was instructed for the interview by her lawyer. He told her to cry out loud during the broadcast, to create public sympathy. In the outcome, however, the interview dealt a major blow to her credibility. In court, Suzane still was very cold, while the Cravinhos brothers were crying most of the time. At one occasion, she even started to laugh.

It was erected between the years 1320 and 1326 by Kokos of Brezovica on the site of an ancient stronghold surrounded by earthen walls in the Pieniny mountains. The Niedzica Castle stands at an altitude of 566 m, on a hill upstream from the Dunajec River mouth, measured from the center of the dam on Lake Czorsztyn. The outline of Niedzica Castle can best be viewed from the ruins of Czorsztyn Castle on the other side of the lake. It is known as one of the most picturesque castles in the country and adorns the covers of many books. History The castle was an important centre of Polish-Hungarian relations since the 14th century. It was a place where the money lent by the Polish king to the Hungarian king Sigismund had to be returned following an agreement signed in 1412. Once the loan was paid back, the Polish king returned the 16 Spi≈° towns given to him by Sigismund as collateral. For centuries the castle was a border-post with Hungary. At the time of the Turkish invasion five hundred years ago, a deal was struck at Niedzica to make it a Polish protectorate. The castle was built by a Hungarian known as Kokos from Brezovica with family rights dating back to 1325. In 1470 it became the property of the aristocratic Z√°polya family. However, in 1528, the entire county including the castle was given away by John Z√°polya aspiring to the Hungarian throne, and became the property of Viliam Drugeth who received it as a reward for his support. Sixty years later it became the property of Hieronim ≈Åaski and his son Olbracht. At the end of the 16th century the castle was bought by J√°n Horv√°th from Plaveƒç. The fortress was renovated many times in the fifteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth and in the beginning of the 19th century by its successive owners. The last Hungarian inhabitants remained there until in 1943 when the coming of the front in World War II inspired the Salamon family to abandon it. The last countess left with her children two years before the Red Army marched in. The final reconstruction of the castle was completed in 1963 under the supervision of the Polish Ministry of Culture. It has served as a historical museum ever since. Recent conservation concerns A new artificial reservoir, Lake Czorsztyn, was created in 1994 by damming the Dunajec River downstream of the castle. The castle now stands approx. above the upper water level. The castle hill consists of limestone rock saddled on shale and marl found much below the current bed of the Dunajec River. Studies and analyses show that rock strata forming the limestone bank are weather- resistant, and provide secure foundation for the castle in spite of visible surface deterioration. In order to secure the stability of the hill, a number of reinforcing works were effected in the strip between the high- and low- water marks. The works include concrete reinforcement of rocks, substratum (weathered shale and marl) replacement, and surface protection elements on the hill. The castle and the hill are subject to constant monitoring. The museum Niedzica Castle courtyard Although in large part only ruins remain of what used to be the Gothic castle in Niedzica, its dungeons and a number of rooms survived, as have some of the paintings ‚Äî including the Crucifixion that once adorned the chapel ‚Äî and furnishings which are not entirely as they were in the 1930s. The architectural design consists of a densely packed complex of buildings with a courtyard surrounded by residential wings with arcades, towers and fortified walls. The museum in Niedzica holds archaeological artifacts related to the castle, remnants of the masonry that once adorned its interiors, prints and engravings with views of the castle from various periods, and historical documentation. The museum's collections include ethnographic exhibits from the Spi≈° region, a collection of antique clocks, 18th and 19th century pistols, hunting rifles, and taxidermied game. In 1996, a new collection was added. Because of the fortress's Hungarian origins, √Åkos Engelmayer, Hungarian ambassador to Poland (1990-1995), donated his collection of Hungarian-related items of historical interest from Poland, such as maps of Hungary from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries, engravings depicting various Hungarian kings and castles, as well as cities and battlegrounds; which it is hoped have become the largest collection of Hungarian-related materials outside of Hungary. The castle is a great place to visit. The views are magnificent, particularly to the south over the Pieniny mountains. The legend Before the Czorsztyn reservoir was built, the castle had a very Dracula-like setting, perched high on a wall above the Dunajec River. It was a place rich in tales and legends with some of the former residents resembling characters from gothic novels. In the post-World War II period Polish newspapers wrote at length about Sebasti√°n Berzeviczy (one of Niedzica's owners) who traveled to the New World in the 18th century. About Sebasti√°n Berzeviczy at www.pieniny.sk/ciele/niedzica/en.html According to a popular legend, he fell in love with the alleged Inca princess. Their daughter UminaUmina, the Inca daughter of Sebasti√°n Berzeviczy (source in Polish only) married the nephewAndr√©s T√∫pac Amaru, nephew of Tupac Amaru II, mentioned alongside rebel leader Tupac Katari in Wikipedia of an Inca insurrection leader T√∫pac Amaru II, whose assumed name implied descent from Inca kings. T√∫pac Amaru was eventually executed by the Spaniards after rebelling against the colonial government. The legend goes on to claim that the sacred scrolls of the Incas had been handed down to his surviving family members. His nephew, Andr√©s T√∫pac Amaru a.k.a. AndreasAndreas and Umina in Europe. (source in Polish only) with wife UminaPrincess Umina mentioned in \\"The Inca Trail\\" by Roy Davies and his father-in-law Sebasti√°n Berzeviczy fled to Italy, where Andr√©s was killed in suspicious circumstances. Consequently, Umina with son and her father fled to Hungary and settled at the castle. Sources claim that Umina was assassinated there some time later. Her testament to son Anton, written in 1797 and stored there, allegedly contained information about the lost treasure of the Incas. There was a leaden case found at the castle with some ‚Äúquipu‚Äù writings, but it was lost in Krak√≥w in the following years. Later, news appeared about expeditions searching for fantastic treasures at Lake Titicaca in Peru. The notion that the Inca treasure map could be hidden somewhere in the depths of the castle is still cherished today. Other tales follow the exploits of a motley crew of the castle's other former owners. They include stories of counts and jesters who tortured village folk, stabbed priests and misbehaved. The graphic novel The legend of Niedzica was also the inspiration for a graphic novel, \\"Rainbow and the Sun\\" by Roko Zaper, which follows Andre Benesz as he discovers his heritage and the past he never knew.

United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), was a United States Supreme Court case decided during the Franklin Delano Roosevelt presidency, regarding the powers that a President of the United States has to remove certain executive officials of a \\"quasi-legislative,\\" \\"quasi-judicial\\" administrative body created by Congress, for purely political reasons and without the consent of Congress.. Background President Calvin Coolidge appointed William Humphrey as a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1925, and he was reappointed for another six-year term in 1931. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, he became dissatisfied with Humphrey as Humphrey did not, in Roosevelt's view, support his New Deal policies vigorously enough. Twice, Roosevelt requested Humphrey to resign from the FTC, requests to which Humphrey did not yield. Finally, in 1933 Roosevelt fired Humphrey: \\"Effective as of this date you are hereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.\\" Nevertheless, Humphrey continued to come to work at the FTC even after he was formally fired. However, the Federal Trade Commission Act permitted the President to dismiss an FTC member only for \\"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\\" Roosevelt's decision to dismiss Humphrey was based solely on political differences rather than job performance or alleged acts of malfeasance. Supreme Court decision The case went to the Supreme Court, but Humphrey died in 1934 before the case could be decided. The case was then pursued by the executors of his estate; thus, the case obtained the title \\"Humphrey's Executor\\". The Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers. The latter may be removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress; the former serve at the pleasure of the President and may be removed at his discretion. The Court ruled that the Federal Trade Commission was a quasi- legislative body because of other powers it had and so the President could not fire an FTC member solely for political reasons; thus, Humphrey's firing was improper. U.S. Attorney General Robert H. Jackson, later to join the Supreme Court himself, said in his memoirs that Roosevelt was particularly annoyed by the Court's decision, as the President felt that it had been rendered in spite. William Humphrey died before the Supreme Court could rule on whether his dismissal by the President from the Federal Trade Commission was valid.

The city of Chester was founded as a fort, known as Deva, by the Romans in AD 79. The city was the scene of battles between warring Welsh and Saxon kingdoms throughout the post- Roman years until the Saxons strengthened the fort against raiding Danes. Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, Chester came under the Earl of Chester. It became a centre of the defense against Welsh raiders and a launch point for raids on Ireland. The city grew as a trading port until the power of the Port of Liverpool overtook it. However the city did not decline and during the Georgian and Victorian periods was seen as a place of escape from the more industrial cities of Manchester and Liverpool. Roman Model of how Deva Victrix would probably have looked. The Romans founded Chester as Deva Victrix in AD 70s in the land of the Celtic Cornovii, according to ancient cartographer Ptolemy,Ptolemy (1992), Book II Chapter 2 as a fortress during the Roman expansion north.Mason (2001), p. 42. It was named Deva either after the goddess of the Dee,Salway, P. (1993) The Oxford Illustrated History of Roman Britain. ISBN CN 1634 or directly from the British name for the river. The 'victrix' part of the name was taken from the title of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix who were based at Deva.Mason (2001), p. 128. A civilian settlement grew around the settlement, probably starting as a group of traders and their families who were profiting from trade with the fortress.Mason (2001), p. 101. The fortress was 20% larger than other fortresses in Britannia built around the same time at York (Eboracum) and Caerleon (Isca Augusta);Carrington (2002), p. 33-35. this has led to the suggestion that the fortress may have been intended to become the capital of the province rather than London (Londinium).Carrington (2002), p. 46. The civilian amphitheatre which was built in 1st century could sit between 8,000 and 10,000 people, is the largest known military amphitheatre in Britain,Carrington (2002), p. 54-56. and is also a Scheduled Monument. The Minerva Shrine in the Roman quarry is the only rock cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain. The fortress was garrisoned by the legion until at least the late 4th century. Although the army would have abandoned the fortress by 410 when the Romans retreated from BritanniaMason (2001), p. 209-210. the civilians settlement continued and its occupants probably continued to use the fortress and its defences as protection from raiders in the Irish Sea. Sub-Roman and Saxon period Pennant's, A tour in Wales, 1778 The Roman withdrawal from Britain was effectively complete by 410 and the Britons established a number of successor states. The area of Chester is thought to have formed part of the kingdom of Powys, whose early kings claimed descent from the exile Vortigern.

In Welsh legend, King Arthur is said to have fought his ninth battle against the Saxon invasion at the \\"city of the legions\\" and later came to the city to try and subjugate the Welsh bishops to his mission. In 616, √Üthelfrith of Northumbria defeated a Welsh army at the Battle of Chester and probably established the Anglo-Saxon position in the area from then on. The Anglo-Saxons adopted the native name as the calque Legeceaster, which over time was shortened to Ceaster and finally corrupted to Chester. In 689, King √Üthelred of Mercia founded the Minster Church of West Mercia on what is considered to be an early Christian site and known as the Minster of St John the Baptist, Chester (now St John the Baptist's Church), which later became the city's first cathedral. In the 9th century, the body of √Üthelred's niece, was removed from Hanbury in Staffordshire; in order to save its desecration by Danish marauders, she was reburied in the Church of & Paul--later to become the Abbey Church and present cathedral. Her name is still remembered by the St Werburgh's Street which passes beside the cathedral. The Saxons extended and strengthened the city walls to protect the city against the Danes, who occupied it for a short time until Alfred seized all the cattle and laid waste the surrounding land to drive them out. In fact it was Alfred's daughter √Üthelfleda, \\"Lady of the Mercians\\", who rebuilt the Saxon burh. In 907, she dedicated a new church to . The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that, in 973, King Edgar came to Chester following his coronation at Bath. He held his court in a place located in what is now called \\"Edgar's Field\\", near the old Dee bridge in Handbridge. Taking a barge up the River Dee from his court to the Minster of the Baptist, Edgar supposedly took the helm of the vessel while it was rowed by six or eightIn the account of the monk Henry Bradshaw. tributary \\"kings\\" (, \\"little kings\\"). The Chronicles of Melrose and of Florence of Worcester describe that \\"eight petty kings, namely, Kynath, king of the Scots, Malcolm, king of the Cumbrians, Maccus, king of several isles and five others, named Dufnall, Siferth, Huwall, Jacob and Juchill, met him there as he had appointed and swore that they would be faithful to him, and assist him by land and by sea\\". After the kings swore fealty and allegiance they rowed him back to the palace. As he entered he is reported to have said that with so many kings' allegiance his successors could boast themselves to be kings of the English. Middle Ages Chester Castle Hugh d'Avranches' Hall and Parliament House, Chester. c.1781 The arms granted to Chester City following to conquest After the 1066 Norman Conquest and the Harrying of the North, the Normans took Chester, destroying 200 houses in the city. Hugh d'Avranches, the first Norman earl (it was first given to a Fleming, Gherbod, who never took up residence but returned to Flanders where he was captured, and later killed) was William's nephew. He built a motte and bailey near the river, as another defence from the Celts. It is now known as Chester Castle and was rebuilt in stone by Henry III in 1245, after the last of six Norman earls died without issue. Chester's earls were a law unto themselves. They kept huge hunting forests - Hugo was said to have 'preferred falconers and huntsmen to the cultivators of the soil', and Ranulf I converted the Wirral farmlands into another hunting forest. Before Ranulph, Hugo's son had inherited at the age of seven but died in the White Ship, along with the king's heir, William, on his way to England from France, where he was educated under the guardianship of Henry I. Earl Ranulf II, Ranulph's son, even helped to capture King Stephen in 1140, and ended up controlling a third of England after supporting Henry II's claim to the throne. Other earls were Hugh II, Ranulf III and John the Scot. The traditional independence that Chester had under the earls was confirmed by a charter of Richard II in 1398 stating that 'the said county of Chester shall be the principality of Chester'. The earls are remembered with their shields on the suspension bridge over the river Dee, and again on the Grosvenor Park lodge. The first earl had endowed a great Benedictine monastery dedicated to Saint Werburgh in 1092 (on the site of the church of dedicated to St Peter and St Paul). The monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in 1540 and was rededicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary to become Chester Cathedral. Previously, the first Chester Cathedral was begun in 1075 by the first Norman Bishop of Mercia, Peter de Leya after the See was moved from Lichfield in Chester. De Leya's successor moved the See to Coventry and it later returned to Lichfield. St John's became the co-Cathedral and Collegiate Church. There is a popular belief that it was the silting of the River Dee that created the land which is now Chester's racecourse (known as the Roodee), on which a stone cross still stands which is said to have been erected in memory of Lady Trawst who died as a result of an image of the Virgin Mary called Holy Rood falling upon her in Hawarden church a few miles down the river). But the Roodee was in existence as early as the 13th and 14th centuries, so it cannot have been created by later silting. The silting which led to the creation of the Roodee, in its current form, is well established on a sequence of post-medieval maps dating from the later 16th century. It has also been established by archaeological evaluations and excavations in the area of the Old Port, known as the Roodee tail. Physical evidence for the silting of this area of the city is shown by the building of the 14th-century port watch tower, now known as the Water Tower, which projects from the north-west corner of the city walls. This tower was originally built out into the river. Maps of the 16th century, its archaeological form and related documentary evidence all demonstrate this. Despite stories to the contrary, the weir above the Old Dee Bridge was not built by the Romans but by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester between 1077 and 1101 to hold water for his river mills. The purpose of the weir on the river was to keep water levels high for these mills, one of which gave rise to the traditional song \\"Miller of Dee\\", which reflects the attitude of the happy miller who was granted a monopoly on grinding. It also prevents the salty tidal waters from entering the Dee fresh water basin. Chester's port flourished under Norman rule. In 1195 a monk, Lucian, wrote 'ships from Aquitaine, Spain, Ireland and Germany unload their cargoes of wine and other merchandise'. In fact wine was only imported through four other English ports. During the 13th century Chester was famous for its fur trade and even by the mid-16th century the port was importing large amounts of fur and skins. In 1543 one ship alone brought in '1600 shhep fells, 68 dere, 69 fawne skins and 6300 broke (badger skins)' . However the estuary was silting up so that trading ships to the port of Chester had to harbour downstream at Neston, Parkgate, and \\"Hoyle Lake\\" or Hoylake. Chester's first known mayor was William the Clerk. The second known mayor was Walter of Coventry, who served between 1241 and 1245. The town's third mayor was Walter de Livet (Levett) who was named as mayor in a royal decree from May 1246.Appointment of Walter Lyvet, Chester, by King Henry III, Windsor, 1251, Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III Preserved in the Public Record Office, London, 1908 (Walter of Coventry and Walter de Livet may be the same person.)Mayors and Sheriffs of Cheshire, British History Online During early Chester history, the mayor often held his position for 10 years or more; apparently the early mayor's terms were open- ended. Late medieval Chester, 1230-1550, A HIstory of the County of Cheshire: Volume 5, Part 1, C. P. Lewis, A. T. Thacker, Victoria County HIstory, British History Online, british-history.ac.uk Tudor and Stuart times Originally the port was located to the north of the Watergate just below the city wall. To the south of the Watergate the Roodee existed in smaller form than today. The map sequence shows the river moving its course from against the wall north of the Watergate out to its current location between 1580 and approximately the 1830s. By the first edition OS map the river had reached its current position. However, it is apparent that some rivulets and inlets have been lost since, although some have been identified in archaeological work on the site of the former House of Industry and Gasworks. In September 1642 tension between King Charles I and Parliament was growing and civil war looked like it might be a possibility. Charles visited Chester and ensured the election of pro-royalist mayor William Ince. In March 1643, leading Chester royalist Francis Gamull was commissioned to raise a regiment of foot to defend the city. Colonel Robert Ellis, an experienced soldier, was asked to construct outer defences to the city. A series of earthworks were constructed around the city from Boughton through Hoole and Newton to the Water Tower. The earthworks consisted of a ditch and mud wall with a series of 'mounts' or gun platforms were added along with turnpike gates on incoming roads. Parliamentary forces began to lay siege to the city of Chester. In the early morning of 20 September 1645, parliamentary forces overran the eastern earthworks at the Boughton turnpike and captured the east suburbs of the city up to the walls. They began to construct cannon batteries within range of the city. A cannon battery placed in St John's churchyard breached the city walls on 22 September near the Roman amphitheatre. A hole some 25 feet wide was made with thirty-two cannon shots. Following the breach an attempt was made to storm the city, but the defenders repelled the charge. According to an account at the time by Lord Byron, the breach was stopped up with woolpacks and featherbeds from all parts of the town. One can see to this day the repairs made to the wall, the section of which is next to the Roman Gardens (see photo below). On the evening of 23 September 1645, King Charles I entered the City of Chester with 600 men via the Old Dee Bridge. He stayed the night at Sir Francis Gamull's house on Bridge Street. Also during the evening Sydenham Poyntz, a Parliamentarian in pursuit of the King's forces, entered Whitchurch (15 miles to the south) with 3000 horse. A battle looked likely. Later that evening the King became aware of Poyntz's movements, as a messenger was intercepted at Holt. A decision was made to send out Lord Gerrard's horse troops and five hundred foot soldiers in the morning. On the morning of 24 September 1645 the Battle of Rowton Heath occurred in moor land called Miller's Heath near the village of Rowton, two miles to the south east of Chester on the modern A41 road. Parliamentary forces crushed the Royalist loyal Cavaliers. The city was under siege at the time by the Parliamentary army. Royalist forces were coming to lift the siege and join up with Scottish allies, but were intercepted by Parliamentary Forces outside Chester. The engagement lasted all day starting at 9am and continued throughout the day in three stages as Royalists were pushed back towards the City and its walls. The battle was mainly conducted on horseback with musketeers supporting the cavalry's flanks. As the battle went on into the afternoon, more troops were ordered to march out of the Northgate in support of the Royalists on Rowton Moor, but this decision was too late‚Äîthe battle was already lost. As the fighting reached the suburbs it was watched by King Charles I and Sir Francis Gamull from Chester's Phoenix Tower (now also called King Charles' Tower) on the city walls. The King quickly withdrew to the Cathedral tower, but even this was not safe, as the captain standing next to him was shot in the head by musket fire from the victorious Parliamentarians who took residence in the St John's Church tower. The battle cost the lives of 600 Royalists and an unknown number of Parliamentarians. Among the Royalist dead was Lord Bernard Stuart (1622‚Äì1645) Earl of Lichfield, the king's cousin. His portrait is displayed in the National Gallery. Also slain at the same time was William Lawes (1602‚Äì1645) a noted English composer and musician. He was buried in Chester Cathedral without a memorial. He was remembered by the king as the 'Father of Musick' and his portrait as a cavalier hangs in the Faculty of Music at Oxford. Today there is a small memorial to the battle in the village of Rowton. It consists of a brief history and a battle plan of field at the time.1940s Map of the Battle Site The next day the king slipped out of Chester and crossed the Old Dee Bridge en route to Denbigh. He left instructions for the city to hold out for 10 days more. By 1646, after having refused to surrender nine times and with Lord Byron at the head of the city's defences, having only spring water and boiled wheat for lunch ‚Äî the citizens (17,000) had already eaten their dogs ‚Äî a treaty was signed. The mills and the waterworks lay in ruins. When the exultant Puritan forces were let loose on the city, despite the treaty, they destroyed religious icons including the high cross, which was not erected again for over three centuries. In 1646 King Charles I was proclaimed a traitor beside its base. Worse was to come. The starved citizens then bore the full brunt of the plague, with 2099 people dead from the summer of 1647 to the following spring. In 1643 Sir Richard Grosvenor petitioned the Assembly to enclose the Row which ran through the front of his town house on Lower Bridge Street, and his request was granted. At the time he was employed in the Royalist army as a Commander. Some speculate that perhaps the room was being used to organise the Royalist Resistance in Chester. In the years after the war, people further down the street also asked for the Row to be enclosed. Eventually Lower Bridge Street lost its rows. The only trace can now be found at number 11. Most of Chester was rebuilt after the Civil War. There are many fine half-timbered houses dating from this time still standing today. Chester port declined with most of the ships going from the colonies now going to Liverpool, although it was still the major port of passenger embarkation for Ireland until the early 19th century. A new port was established on the Wirral called Parkgate, but this also fell out of use. The road to the port of Chester was called the 'Great Irish Road' and ran from Bristol to Chester. Georgian and Victorian eras A plan of the city of Chester, c.1782 The port declined seriously from 1762 onwards. By 1840 it could no longer effectively compete with Liverpool as a port, although significant shipbuilding and ropemaking continued at Chester. It was once thought that Chester's maritime trade was brought to an end by the silting of the River Dee, although recent research has shown this was not the case. It was the use of larger ocean-going ships that led to the diversion of the trade to the relatively young town of Liverpool and other locations on the River Mersey, which had long been rivals to Chester, such as Runcorn. In the Georgian era, Chester became again a centre of affluence, a town with elegant terraces where the landed aristocracy lived. This trend continued into the Industrial Revolution, when the city was populated with the upper classes in fleeing to a safe distance from the industrial sprawls of Manchester and Liverpool. Edmund Halley (of comet fame) was the deputy controller of Chester Castle for a short time and on 10 May 1697 recorded a fall of one inch hailstones in the area. William Molyneux was in exile here from Ireland in 1691 and was working on his book Dioptrics published in London the following year. The Industrial Revolution brought the Chester Canal (now part of the Shropshire Union Canal) to the city (which was dubbed 'England's first unsuccessful canal', after its failure to bring heavy industry to Chester) as well as railways and two large central stations, only one of which remains. The building of the route to Holyhead involved one particularly notable tragedy, when a cast iron bridge over the river Dee just by the Roodee race course, collapsed. The Dee bridge disaster sent shock waves through the whole nation because there were many other bridges of similar design on the growing national rail network. Robert Stephenson was the engineer to the new line, and he came in for heavy criticism at the inquest held locally. The design was faulty, and many other bridges had to be demolished or replaced. In an attempt to strengthen the brittle cast iron girders of the bridge, Stephenson added tough wrought iron straps along the length of the spans, but, far from improving the structure, added little or no extra strength. A Royal Commission was set up to investigate the problem, and they confirmed the conclusions of the Railway Inspectorate that the design was wrong. Chester Town Hall A leadworks was established by the canal in 1799; its shot tower, which was used for making lead shot for the Napoleonic Wars, is the oldest remaining shot tower in the UK. The Ruskinian Venetian Gothic Town Hall was ceremoniously opened by Prince of Wales in 1869; its design, following a public competition held to replace the Exchange building, which had stood at the centre of Northgate Street until it burnt down in 1862, was by William Henry Lynn (1829‚Äì1915) an Irish architect with a practice in Belfast. Along with the Cathedral Church of Christ & the Blessed Virgin Mary, it still dominates the city skyline with its clock tower with only three faces, with the Wales-facing side remaining blank. The reason for this was popularly reported to be simply because \\"Chester won't give the Welsh the time of day\\". However, this did not stop the town hosting Wales's National Eisteddfod in 1866. The Volunteer Street drill hall was completed in 1868. The Eastgate clock was also built at this time, and is a central feature as it crosses Eastgate street, and is part of the city walls. The clock is very popular with tourists, and this has given it the grand title of the second most photographed clock in the UK (perhaps even the World) after Big Ben.

Life She was the daughter of Charles-Thomas Gibert (1765‚Äì18??) and Marie-Fran√ßoise Le Gras de Vaubercey (1766‚Äì1842). The marriage of her parents ended in divorce,Her Parents and she became the adopted stepdaughter of Antoine Rouyer de Lametz (1762‚Äì1836), Chevalier d'Empire and Knight of the Legion of Honour. She was the paternal granddaughter of Thomas Gibert and Fran√ßoise Moret. Marie Caroline was originally a stage actress, as was her future spouse, Florestan. Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz and Prince Florestan of Monaco, at that time both actors, married in Commercy on 27 November 1816 and had two children: Prince Charles III, and Princess Florestine. She was described as a skillful businesswoman: she handled the economy of the family, and successfully managed the fortune her spouse inherited from his mother (who had excluded her eldest son from her will because of his illegitimate issue) in 1826.Anne Edwards, The Grimaldis of Monaco, 1992 =Princess of Monaco= Florestan ascended to the throne in Monaco in 1841, but he was never prepared to assume the role of prince ‚Äî he had been an actor in the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ambigu-Comique ‚Äî and the real power during his reign lay in the hands of his wife, who reportedly possessed great intelligence and \\"excelled at social skills.\\" According to the historian Gustave Saige, Princess Caroline's intelligence was required to figure out the affairs of state, which Honor√© V had handled absolutely by himself, not trusting anyone to advise or assist him. By introducing a tax reform, she was able to alleviate the difficult economic situation stemming from the Congress of Vienna assigning Monaco as a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia rather than France. Her involvement in state politics, however, gave bad publicity to Florestan.Anne Edwards, The Grimaldis of Monaco, 1992 When their son once reproached her for her de facto regent position, she replied that she ruled simply because she wanted to take responsibility for the welfare of the family.Anne Edwards, The Grimaldis of Monaco, 1992 The couple attempted to meet local demands for greater democracy and offered two constitutions to the local population, but these were rejected, particularly by the people of Menton, who were given a better offer by King Charles Albert of Sardinia. The Prince and Princess of Monaco then handed over power to their son Charles (later Prince Charles III). Encouraged by the Revolutions of 1848, however, the towns of Menton and Roquebrune revolted and declared themselves independent. The crisis worsened when the King of Sardinia garrisoned Menton, Florestan was dethroned, arrested, and imprisoned. Florestan was restored to the throne in 1849, but Menton and Roquebrune were lost forever. They had hoped to be annexed by Sardinia, but this did not occur, and the towns remained in a state of political limbo until they were finally ceded to France in 1861. =Later life= After her husband's death in 1856, her son, Prince Charles III took over control of the throne, after having been well prepared to assume power by his mother.

Adopted in 1889, use of the MKS system of units succeeded the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units (CGS) in commerce and engineering. The metre and kilogram system served as the basis for the development of the International System of Units (abbreviated SI), which now serves as the international standard. Because of this, the standards of the CGS system were gradually replaced with metric standards incorporated from the MKS system. An advantage of MKS units is that the derived units (like joules) are based on MKS units, using MKS units naturally gives answers in the appropriate SI unit. For example, the kinetic energy of an object is defined by . If the calculation is done in MKS units of kilogram and metres per second then the result is in joules, the SI unit for energy. If the same calculation is done using CGS units the answer is in ergs (). The exact list of units used in the MKS system changed over time. It incorporated base units other than the metre, kilogram, and second in addition to derived units. An incomplete list of the base and derived units appears below. Since the MKS system of units never had a governing body to rule on a standard definition, the list of units depended on different conventions at different times. * Cycle (This dimensionless quantity became synonymous with the term \\"cycle per second\\" as an abbreviation.

This theory was proposed by Lisa Feldman Barrett to resolve what she calls the \\"emotion paradox,\\" which she claims has perplexed emotion researchers for decades, and describes as follows: People have vivid and intense experiences of emotion in day-to-day life: they report seeing emotions like \\"anger\\", \\"sadness\\", and \\"happiness\\" in others, and they report experiencing \\"anger\\", \\"sadness\\" and so on themselves. Nevertheless, psychophysiological and neuroscientific evidence has failed to yield consistent support for the existence of such discrete categories of experience. Instead, the empirical evidence suggests that what exists in the brain and body is affect, and emotions are constructed by multiple brain networks working in tandem. Despite this evidence, most other theories of emotion assume that emotions are genetically endowed, not learned, and are produced by dedicated circuits in the brain: an anger circuit, a fear circuit, and so on. This point of view is very much in line with common-sense conceptions of emotion. The theory of constructed emotion calls this assumption into question. It suggests that these emotions (often called \\"basic emotions\\") are not biologically hardwired, but instead are phenomena that emerge in consciousness \\"in the moment\\" from more fundamental ingredients.  Statement of the theory  The theory is given in simplified form as: > \\"In every waking moment, your brain uses past experience, organized as > concepts, to guide your actions and give your sensations meaning. When the > concepts involved are emotion concepts, your brain constructs instances of > emotion.\\" In greater detail, instances of emotion are constructed throughout the entire brain by multiple brain networks in collaboration. Ingredients going into this construction include interoception, concepts, and social reality. Interoceptive predictions provide information about the state of the body and ultimately produce basic, affective feelings of pleasure, displeasure, arousal, and calmness. Concepts are embodied knowledge (from your culture), including emotion concepts. Social reality provides the collective agreement and language that make the perception of emotion possible among people who share a culture. As an analogy, consider the experience of color. People experience colors as discrete categories: blue, red, yellow, and so on, and these categories vary in different cultures. The physics of color, however, is actually continuous, with wavelengths measured in nanometers along a scale from ultraviolet to infrared. When a person experiences an object as \\"blue\\", she is (unconsciously) using her color concepts to categorize this wavelength. And in fact, people experience a whole range of wavelengths as \\"blue.\\" Likewise, emotions are commonly thought of as discrete and distinct -- fear, anger, happiness -- while affect (produced by interoception) is continuous. The theory of constructed emotion suggests that at a given moment, the brain predicts and categorizes the present moment via interoceptive predictions and the emotion concepts from one's culture, to construct an instance of emotion, just as one perceives discrete colors. This process instantiates the experience of \\"having an emotion\\". For example, if someone's brain predicts the presence of a snake as well as the unpleasant affect that would result upon encountering a snake, that brain might categorize and construct an experience of \\"fear.\\" This process takes place before any actual sensory input of a snake reaches conscious awareness. In contrast, a \\"basic emotions\\" researcher would say that the person first sees the snake, and this sensory input triggers a dedicated \\"fear circuit\\" in the brain. =Earlier incarnations of the theory= Early incarnations of the theory were phrased in terms of core affect rather than interoception. Core affect is a neurophysiological state characterized along two dimensions: * Pleasure vs. displeasure, measured along a continuous scale from positive to negative. * High arousal vs. low arousal, measured along a continuous scale between these endpoints. According to the original conceptual act model, emotion is generated when a person categorizes his/her core affective state using knowledge about emotion. This theory combines elements of linguistic relativity and affective neuroscience. The term \\"core affect\\" was first used in print by Russell and Barrett in 1999 in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology where it is used to refer to the affective feelings that are part of every conscious state (as discussed by Wundt in his 1889 System der Philosophie). The term \\"core affect\\" also appears to have been used as a phrase that relates to neuropsychological understanding of behavior as a morbid affect at the roots of any type of human behavior. =Related thinking= Joseph LeDoux has reached similar views.

Location The Cordillera de la Costa montane forests extend across a series of isolated coastal mountains with an area of . Most parts of the ecoregion are surrounded by La Costa xeric shrublands. In the west, the ecoregion adjoins Lara-Falc√≥n dry forests. The two most eastern segments are surrounded by Araya and Paria xeric scrub. Physical The Cordillera de la Costa montane forests ecoregion consists of eleven enclaves between in elevation. The Venezuelan Coastal Range, which is actually two parallel ranges, runs east and west across northern Venezuela, separating the Orinoco River basin to the south from the Caribbean Sea to the north. The range consists of western and eastern sections. The Coastal Range is a northeastern extension of the Andes Mountains, separated from the Cordillera de M√©rida to the southwest by the Yaracuy Depression. These forest enclaves are surrounded at lower elevations by the dry La Costa xeric shrublands, and are separated from both the moist forests of the Andes and of Amazonia by dry shrublands and the vast Llanos grasslands of the Orinoco basin. Climate Koppen climate type in the area The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Aw\\": equatorial, winter dry in most of the region. While at higher elevation of mountain range, the K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Cwb\\": warm temperate, winter dry. Flora The ecoregion is home to three main plant communities, evergreen transition forests, evergreen montane cloud forests, and upper montane elfin forest, which are determined by elevation and exposure. =Evergreen transition forests= The Evergreen transition forests extend from 600‚Äì900 metres to 1000 metres elevation. They lie above the drier lower montane semi-deciduous forests of the La Costa xeric shrublands. The transition forests have a closed canopy made up of Trophis racemosa, Ficus macbridei, Tetragastris caracasana, Zanthoxylum ocumarense, Banara nitida, etc. The giant endemic tree Gyranthera caribensis, which can grow up to 60 m in height, forms small emergent stands that rise above the forest canopy. The understory is composed of woody shrubs, ferns, and large herbs like Heliconia bihai, Heliconia revoluta, and Dieffenbachia maculata. =Evergreen montane cloud forests= The Evergreen montane cloud forests range from 1000 to 2000‚Äì2400 m elevation, and the most species-rich plant community in the ecoregion. The forests have a closed canopy of 15‚Äì20 m elevation. Palms are common in both the canopy and the understory, growing as solitary trees or in large clumps, depending on the species. The forests support a dense understory of shrubs, herbs, and ferns, and the trees are festooned with abundant epiphytes (ferns, orchids, bromeliads, ericads and gesneriads). =Upper montane elfin forest and scrub= The Upper montane elfin forest and scrub is found above 2000‚Äì2400 m. It consists of low mossy forests of dwarfed trees, including Clusia multiflora, Weinmannia spp., and Prumnopitys harmsiana, as well as open scrublands dominated by Libanothamnus neriifolius. Fauna Endangered amphibians include Allobates mandelorum, Atelopus cruciger, Flectonotus fitzgeraldi, Gastrotheca ovifera, Hyalinobatrachium pallidum, Mannophryne neblina, Mannophryne riveroi and Pristimantis turumiquirensis. Endangered birds include Venezuelan flowerpiercer (Diglossa venezuelensis), scissor- tailed hummingbird (Hylonympha macrocerca), Paria whitestart (Myioborus pariae), grey-headed warbler (Basileuterus griseiceps), helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi), Urich's tyrannulet (Phyllomyias urichi), red siskin (Spinus cucullatus) and black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori).

The language of these books is Ge Ωez, also called Classical Ethiopic. These books are completely different in content and subject from the various better known books of Maccabees in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles. The account of the \\"Maccabees\\" described in these sacred texts are not those of the advent of the Hasmonean dynasty of Judea, nor are they an account of the \\"Five Holy Maccabean Martyrs\\", nor the \\"woman with seven sons\\", who were also referred to as \\"Maccabees\\" and are revered in Orthodox Christianity as the \\"Holy Maccabean Martyrs\\". The Maccabees who are referenced do not correspond to known martyrology and their identity is never fully clarified by the ancient author. However, they do assume the familiar moniker of being \\"a Maccabee\\", the etymological origins of which remain disputed. Like much of the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon, until the 21st century it was only accessible in the Ge'ez or Amharic tongue. There are now two complete translations available in English that are accessible to the general public - a translation into standard English by Feqade Selassie, and an Iyaric translation by Ras Feqade Tebbaqiw in use by Rastafarians. Additionally, the First Book of Ethiopian Maccabees has also been translated into English by DP Curtin.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3DuFDwAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&redir;_esc=y&hl;=en#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Despite this, there is still currently no significant academic scholarship available on the books' authorship or origins. First Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (1 Meqabyan) The text has 36 chapters in total, and gives the account of two separate revolts against Seleucid rule over Judea. The first account begins by stating that there was an idol-worshipping king of Media and Midian who is devoted to the cult of his idols. Unlike the more familiar narrative found in the books of Maccabees, his name is given as \\"Tseerutsaydan\\" (or \\"Tsirutsaydan\\"); this is possibly a folk memory of the historical Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who held court at the Phoenician cities, after he began minting coins with the names \\"Tyre and Sidon\\" (Tsur u Tsaydan) stamped in Punic alongside his image.John Mason Harden, An Introduction to Ethiopic Christian Literature, 1926, p. 38; Ernst Hammerschmidt, √Ñthiopien: Christliches Reich zwischen gestern und morgen, 1967, p. 105. According to this book, a certain man from the territory of Benjamin called Meqabis (or Maccabeus) had three sons Abya (Amharic: ·ä†·â•·ã´ - Abijah), Seela (Amharic: ·à¥·àã - Shelah), and Pantos (Pantera, or Fentos), who opposed the tyrannical policies of the king and refused to worship his idols. Their account consumes only a short section of the book, spanning chapters 1 through chapter 4. They are noted elsewhere in the hagiographical text of the Ethiopian Synaxarion, and hold a feast day within the Ethiopian Church. A second group of brothers are later introduced in Chapter 15. They are called: Yihuda (Amharic: ·ã≠·àÅ·ã≥ - Judah), Meqabis (or Maccabeus) and Mebikyas, and they are said to have led a successful revolt against the ruthless King Akrandis of Midian. This is possibly a historical allusion to the king Alexander I Balas, who ruled the Seleucid Empire after the death of Antiochus IV, and who supported the legitimacy of the Maccabees cause. However, in this folk rendering of history, Mebikyas enters the king's military camp and decapitates him at his dinner table, while his food was still in his mouth. The rest of the book contains no further narratives about the Maccabeans and offers no further historical narrative, instead focusing on principles such as the primacy of God, the importance of good works, and the vanity of earthly power, often illustrated using examples from the Old Testament. =Chapter summary= * Chapter 1: Tseerutsaydan, a king of Midian and Median country, worships idols, offering sacrifices to them and compelling his subjects by force to do likewise. * Chapter 2: Three sons of Maccaebeus, of the tribe of Benjamin (the Meqabyans), refuse to worship the idols, stating instead that they worship the one true God. Being powerful warriors, they elude capture by Tseerutsaydan's forces and escape to the mountains. The king's forces return to the city and threaten to destroy it unless its inhabitants capture the Meqabyan on their behalf; the city's inhabitants plead with the Meqabyan to give themselves up. * Chapter 3: Three of the brothers - Abya, Seela and Fentos - give themselves up to the king's forces, who then deliver them to Tseerutsaydan. After again refusing to worship the king's idols, they are tortured and thrown into jail for three days. They again refuse to worship the idols, and suffer further torture. Tseerutsaydan then decides to feed them to bears, tigers and lions, however the animals refuse to attack them, instead turning on the king's forces, killing 75 of them. In the confusion two other (unnamed) sons of Maccabeus come to release Abya, Seela and Fentos, however the three refuse and then all five are imprisoned. The five brothers are then burned alive in a fire pit, whereupon they die and enter Heaven. * Chapter 4: Tseerutsaydan attempts to dispose of their corpses by burning, drowning and feeding them to vultures, but their bodies remain unharmed at each attempt. At night Tseerutsaydan has a vision of the brothers, and seems to be repentant, however they state that it is up to God how to deal with him, and reiterate the uselessness of his idols. * Chapter 5: An extended attack on the faithlessness of Tseerutsaydan, using the examples of Hiram and Nebuchadnezzar; the glory of God and his angels, as was shown to Tobit and Moses; the primacy of God over earthly kings. * Chapter 6: The contrasting fates of kings in the afterlife: good kings who rule in truth and righteousness shall enter the Hall of Heaven, a brilliant place of abundance and joy; evil kings who ruled unjustly go to Gehenna. This is followed by an extended commentary on King Saul, and his refusal to heed the warnings of the prophet Samuel. * Chapter 7: A king's power comes from God; the vanity of earthly power, which passes away whereas God remains forever; Gehenna awaits arrogant kings and others who neglect God. * Chapter 8: The fate of the soul after death, and the resurrection of the dead; the contrasting fates of sinners and the righteous. * Chapter 9: Idol- worshipping nations (such as Deemas, Cyprus, Athens and Media) will be judged at the Final Judgement. * Chapter 10: The certainty of physical resurrection - the Biblical patriarchs wished to be buried together so that they would arise together. * Chapter 11: As Zebulon, Edom, Armon and Tyre and Sidon will be judged for their idolatry and sin, so will Jerusalem. * Chapter 12: Like Sodom and Gomorrah, Jerusalem devoted itself to sin and idolatry, and shall be judged accordingly. * Chapter 13: Many of Israel's neighbours have been misled by the Devil, a fallen angel who arrogantly rejected God and now misleads many in Israel. * Chapter 14: God's promise to Noah; the sin of Israel, which failed to heed Moses on Mount Sinai; attacks on Israel by surrounding nations a punishment from God. * Chapter 15: King Akrandis of Midian gathers an army and attacks Israel; Israel repents; Akradis is defeated by the three brothers Judah, Mebikyas and Maccabeus; Israel then returns to sin. * Chapter 16: Overview of the nations surrounding Israel. * Chapter 17: Amalek and Edom - two ungodly nations committed to sin and idolatry. * Chapter 18: The judgement of ungodly generations, such as the descendants of Seth and Cain in former times. * Chapter 19: Cain killed Abel for his wife, and fled with her to Qiefaz in the west; the importance of passing on God's Law to the next generation. * Chapter 20: God will protect the righteous and ensure they prosper. * Chapter 21: David and Hezekiah believed in God's law and prospered, Manasseh did not and was defeated; God will punish the wicked and hand them over to the righteous. * Chapter 22: God will judge the good and bad accordingly; the importance of assisting widows and orphans. * Chapter 23: The example of Cain and Abel - those who follow the way of Cain will be sent to Gehenna for eternity. * Chapter 24: The destructive ways of evil persons - gluttony, drunkenness, robbery, hypocrisy and idolatry. * Chapter 25: All that is on the earth and in the heavens is God's and under his control. * Chapter 26: The rich and poor are equal before God. * Chapter 27: Recounting of the seven days of creation and the Fall. * Chapter 28: Genesis story continued: Cain and Abel, Seth, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; the Devil misled many into worship idols; the repeated cycle of Israel's fall into sin, punishment by God and subsequent repentance, as illustrated by David, Jephthah, Gideon, Samson, Barak, Deborah, Judith, Abimelech, Mattathias; this seemingly endless cycle tested God's patience, resulting in the Babylonian captivity; the story of Esther. * Chapter 29: The Exodus from Egypt; the noble examples of David and Samuel. * Chapter 30: God's message to Samuel - Saul to be stripped of the crown; God honours those who honour Him. * Chapter 31: God's message continued - Kings reign by God's will; God honours righteous kings such as David. * Chapter 32: God's message continued - God's care for His creation; the impudence of those who deny their creator. * Chapter 33: God's message continued - God will punish those who reject him, and honour those who remember him. * Chapter 34: Many kingdoms will rise and fall before God's final judgement. * Chapter 35: Israel shall be judged and destroyed for the sins of its rulers. * Chapter 36: God will also judge Israel's neighbours; the importance of living a good life, as exemplified by Abraham, Moses, Isaac and Jacob. God honoured Israel, however they flouted his Law and adopted the foreign gods of their neighbours; the cycle of punishment, repentance and subsequent backsliding; the noble example of Abraham. Second Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (2 Meqabyan) This book contains 21 chapters.Book of Meqabyan II, Wayback Machine, archived from March 2, 2005. Chapters 1-4 recount that a king of Moab named Meqabis (or Maccabeus) made war against Israel, which was God's punishment for their sins. He later repents and is taught the law of the God of Israel by the prophet Re'ay, instituting a golden age in his kingdom, until it is attacked by King Tseerutsaydan. Chapters 5-8 and 12-13 recount the same narrative of 1 Meqabyan of the three brothers who refuse to worship Tseerutsaydan's idols. The rest of the book covers more general religious teachings, with a strong emphasis on the doctrine of physical resurrection after death. =Chapter summary= * Chapter 1: Maccabeus, a man of Ramoth in Moab, unites with the Amalekites and Edom and attacks Israel, with each nation then returning to their homelands in triumph. * Chapter 2: The prophet Re'ay (or Ra'ay) states the attack was God's judgement, and Israel must repent of its wrongdoings. It is stated that at this time Maccabeus, frightened of God's judgement for his sinful conduct, repents and wears dust and sackcloth. * Chapter 3: God instructs Re'ay to visit Maccabeus, who is standing in a pit up to his neck as part of his repentance. Re'ay informs Maccabeus that the success of the attack was in fact due to God, and that God accepts his repentance. Maccabeus removes himself from the pit, and asks Re'ay to provide him knowledge of God's law; as a result Maccabeus returns home, destroys all the idols and temples, and casts out the magicians. Some of the children who had been captured in the attack on Israel help teach the Law to Maccabeus. Meanwhile Israel finds itself in a cycle of degenerating into idolatry, being punished by God via the use of attacks from neighbouring peoples, followed by Israel's repentance. * Chapter 4: Maccabeus follows the Law and institutes it in Moab; as a result the kingdom prospers, its people are glad and its enemies are overcome. * Chapter 5: After Maccabeus dies, his children continue to live righteously. However, after five years, King Tseerutsaydan of Chaldea comes and attacks their kingdom. Despite the manifold sins of his rule, the children of Maccabeus continue to live in righteousness. * Chapter 6: Tseerutsaydan is devoted to his idols, and demands that his subjects also worship them, however the children of Maccabeus refuse to do so. As a result he throws them into a fire, where they die. However he is later visited by them in a night vision, and they rebuke him for his idolatry, stating that he will descend into Gehenna after death. * Chapter 7: They continue to rebuke him and his Devil-inspired idolatry; the vision ends, and Tseerutsaydan stays up all night in fright. * Chapter 8: Despite the visitation Tseerutsaydan continues in his idolatry, growing arrogant in his conquests, and oppressing his subjects; the text reminds us that God will punish evildoers, as Joshua punished the kings of Canaan. * Chapter 9: The evil and unjust will be punished by God, and end up in Gehenna; the importance of following the Law. * Chapter 10: Exhortation to abide by God's word; the example of Balaam and Balak; God punishes those who break his Law, even Israel itself, whom He allowed to be captured and exiled, and Jerusalem destroyed, for their many sins. * Chapter 11: The example of Moses, who stayed loyal to God even as his siblings opposed him (presumably a reference to Miriam and Aaron opposing his taking of a Cushite wife, as recounted in the Book of Numbers, chapter 12) and also during the rebellion of Korah; the importance of the Tabernacle to God and Israel. * Chapter 12: God will punish religious hypocrites and those who disobey his Law, whilst rewarding the righteous. Meanwhile Tseerutsaydan, at the height of his arrogance, proclaims himself immortal, claiming that the powers of God are his. At that precise moment the angel of death (Thilimyakos) kills him, and the Chaldeans, who had been preparing to fight him, come and plunder his kingdom (presumably a separate or insurgent group of Chaldeans, as Tseerutsaydan is earlier stated to be the king of Chaldea in chapter 5). * Chapter 13: The example of the five children of Maccabeus who, by refusing to offer sacrifices to the king's idols, rightly feared punishment in the hereafter more than punishment on earth, and who are therefore assured of eternal bliss in heaven. * Chapter 14: The teachings of Jewish sects, such as the Samaritans, Pharisees and Sadducees, on the resurrection (namely, that physical resurrection will not occur) condemned. * Chapter 15: All will be judged according to their works on the Day of Judgements; those who denied physical resurrection will be condemned. * Chapter 16: Contrasting fates of righteous believers and iniquitous unbelievers in the afterlife. * Chapter 17: Allegory of plants - as God feeds them water to grow and flourish, likewise with the human soul with His teachings; drunkenness condemned. * Chapter 18: Those who deny physical resurrection destined for Gehenna. * Chapter 19: Death comes to all - powerful and weak, good and evil; final judgement shall occur after physical resurrection. * Chapter 20: Good works and bad will be revealed at the final judgement; the good shall be led to heaven by angels, the bad to Gehenna by demons. * Chapter 21: Thieves and murderers will be punished; the noble example of Moses, who showed Israel the Law; the righteous will reside with God forever. Third Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (3 Meqabyan) This is the shortest of the three books, containing 10 chapters.Book of Meqabyan III, Wayback Machine, archived from April 26, 2005. At times, within the liturgical practices of the Ethiopian Church, the 2nd and 3rd Books of Meqabyan are collapsed to form a single text. It is a diffuse account of salvation and punishment, and the importance of maintaining faith in God, illustrated from the lives of various Biblical patriarchs, such as Adam, Job, and David. Much of the book is concerned with the Devil and how he tempts humans to sin. It is stated that the Devil was originally an angel who was punished by God for arrogantly refusing to bow down to his creation Adam (this same story appears in various non-canonical Apocryphal works concerning Adam, as well in the Iblis narratives of the Quran). =Chapter summary= * Chapter 1: The Devil will be brought low; the text details a long speech by the Devil, where he boasts in how he turns humans away from God's Law, leading them to Gehenna; the Devil (here assumed to have originally been an angel) was punished by God for refusing to bow to Adam; a debate between God and the Devil; those who refuse God will be given over to the Devil. * Chapter 2: The Devil states how he misleads humans with the temptations of the world; the creation of Adam was partly a response to the Devil's arrogance when an angel; how the Devil corrupted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. * Chapter 3: Despite the Fall, God continued to care for Adam and Eve. * Chapter 4: The arrogance of the Devil condemned; Adam was created to praise God; the contrition of Adam contrasted with unrepentant arrogance of the Devil. * Chapter 5: Good and bad deeds will be weighed up at the Day of Judgements; the dangers of sin. * Chapter 6: Contrasting fates of good and evil people. * Chapter 7: The importance of maintaining faith in God, using the example of David. * Chapter 8: The importance of maintaining faith in God, using the example of Job. * Chapter 9: All things on earth are God's, and only God has omniscience; the importance of maintaining faith in God; sinners and idolaters will end up in Gehenna. * Chapter 10: Reward and punishment will be meted out at the time of physical resurrection; the need to do good works in this life, as it will be too late on the Day of Judgement.

As a constructive theologian, Keller's work is oriented around social and ecological justice, poststructuralist theory, and feminist readings of scripture and theology. Both her early and her late work brings relational thinking into theology, focusing on the relational nature of the concept of the divine, and the forms of ecological interdependence within the framework of relational theology. Her work in process theology draws on the relational ontology of Alfred North Whitehead, fielding it in a postmodern, deconstructive framework. Education Keller received a Ph.D. in Philosophy of Religion and Theology from Claremont Graduate School in 1984, a M.Div. from Eden Theological Seminary in 1977, and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) equivalent in Theology from University of Heidelberg in 1974. Academics Keller's work stresses an interdisciplinary approach, pulling from sub-fields such as feminist thought, environmental thought, and Continental philosophy. She has played a leading role in building interdisciplinary connections into, and out of, the field of theology. Since 2001 she has had a central role in directing and developing Drew University's Transdisciplinary Theological Colloquium. The colloquia seek to \\"foster a fresh style of theological discourse that is at once self-deconstructive in its pluralism and constructive in its affirmations\\". Recent colloquia have brought theology into conversation with movements such as Queer Theory and Animal Studies, have offered novel perspectives on debates about Religion and Science, and have explored topics such as political theology. Notable scholars from outside the field of theology who have participated in the colloquia in recent years include: William E. Connolly, Karen Barad, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Daniel Boyarin, and Amy Hollywood. With John Caputo, Roland Faber and others, Keller provides leadership in the field of theopoetics.

The plot revolves around Pi and his attempt to win the heart of Cordelia while dealing with a tiger shark that is terrorizing him and the reef's inhabitants. The film was a critical and commercial failure. It was largely criticised for borrowing heavily from other films such as Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo, DreamWorks' Shark Tale, and Walt Disney's The Little Mermaid (and at one point, a reference to Star Wars and The Karate Kid), and despite the well known actors and comedians involved in the voiceover work, was a box-office bomb. Despite being an American-South Korean co-production, the movie did not receive a theatrical release in the United States, where it was released direct to DVD in 2007. A direct-to-DVD sequel, The Reef 2: High Tide was released in 2012. Plot Pisces, or Pi (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), is a 5-year-old orange fish that lives happily with his parents Pike and Piper in the polluted harbor of Boston, Massachusetts, until a fishing boat scoops them from the sea. Pi's parents manage to help him escape, but cannot escape themselves. Before they are taken away, Piper tells Pi to promise her he would go live with his aunt. Pi's porpoise friends Percy (Trent Ford) and Percy's mother Meg (Megahn Perry) agree to take him, but Pi refuses to leave in case his parents return, Meg sadly tells him that once anyone is taken by a net they can never come back; Pi is heartbroken that his parents are gone forever. Meg and Percy take Pi to live with his aunt Pearl on an exotic reef. When Pi reaches the reef, he is 18 years old and has stayed with the porpoises for most of his life. The first residents Pi comes across are three elderly marlin named Moe, Jack, and Manny, which direct him towards Pearl's home. On his way there, Pi immediately falls in love with Cordelia (Evan Rachel Wood), a celebrity fish that has appeared on the front cover of National Geographic. He also meets his cousin Dylan (Andy Dick), that quickly becomes Pi's best friend. However, Pi soon encounters Troy (Donal Logue), the meanest, toughest tiger shark in the ocean, who is not only terrorizing everyone in the reef community, but also has his eye set on Cordelia to become his mate. Pi confronts Troy, only to be physically assaulted by him. Cordelia tells Pi that the only dangerous place on the reef is between Troy and whatever he wants claiming that Troy is her problem, and if Pi wishes to help, he won‚Äôt interfere. Pi and Dylan find their way home, where Pearl (Fran Drescher) is excited to see that Pi has arrived. She is a fortune teller along with her assistant Madge, a sea star and uses a pink pearl that Dylan's deceased father gave to her as a crystal ball. Pearl reads Pi's future and is surprised, saying that he is destined for great things and that the reef is the best place he will be able to find it. Pearl then tells Pi that he can go anywhere on the reef excluding an old pirate wreck and a forbidden place called \\"flat bottom\\". Pearl leaves Dylan in charge of showing Pi around. Dylan tells Pi about Nerissa (Rob Schneider), a wise old hermit loggerhead turtle that lives in the old shipwreck and practices martial arts, leading to rumors that he is a wizard. Eventually they stumble upon flat bottom, the open sea which is outside of the wildlife sanctuary free for humans to come with their fishing nets. Dylan leaves after a close encounter and Pi sees Cordelia, but per her instructions does not interact. Until he hears her scream after getting a lure stuck in her fin and swears to help her. Pi brings Cordelia to Buddy and Lou who successfully remove it, she invites him to go to a concert with her. Beforehand, Pi meets Dylan once again and they observe Nerissa defend his blue pearl using the sea from a gang of squid nappers. At the amphitheatre that night with Cordelia, Pi learns about the performer Thornton (John Rhys Davies) a harbor seal that tangled with a large creature. Afterwards, Pi and Cordelia look at the stars and she falls in love with him. Suddenly, Troy arrives and chases them before eventually catching up to them both. Pi refuses to leave Cordelia, but Troy starts abusing him worse than ever, until Cordelia makes a deal with him: if he leaves Pi alone, she will marry Troy (which, in this case, is done when someone \\"accepts someone else's pearl\\"), Pi is knocked unconscious by Troy and is carried to Nerissa's shipwreck by a current. When Nerissa tells Pi the following day, he decides he has had enough of Troy's abuse towards him, and asks Nerissa to teach him the ways of the ocean to combat Troy. Nerissa initially refuses, Pi asks other residents to help him, but the marlins think because of their age, they won't be useful. Pi asks Thornton, he states Pi must be crazy, Pi only reminds Thornton of his tale of his encounter with a sea monster. However, he states that he did not actually fight a monster, but due to his \\"poetic license\\" it didn‚Äôt count as lying. Meanwhile, Troy's henchmen Bart and Eddie try to steal Nerissa's pearl, but are frightened away by Pi and Dylan. Nerissa arrives and is impressed with Pi's skills, agreeing to train him the next morning. On Pi's first day of training, Pearl is worried, telling Pi that she could not live with herself if he were killed. Pi reminds his aunt how she told him he would find his destiny on the reef, and he did when he met Cordelia. Stating now he‚Äôs losing her as how he lost his parents. Pi reminds Pearl how he couldn't do anything to save them, but he can still save Cordelia. Nerissa starts by telling Pi that Troy picks on anyone smaller than him, and he has never learned about things bigger than him, Nerissa says the ocean itself is bigger than Troy and if Pi can use the ocean against him, his own size would not matter. Nerissa leads Pi down a valley with obstacles, including razor-sharp elkhorn coral, burning fire coral, a long, narrow tunnel known as Bottleneck Alley, and finally a current known as the West Indies current, full of Portuguese man o' war that could kill someone Pi's size. Meanwhile, Cordelia is informed by Buddy and Lou about Pi's upcoming battle with Troy. Nerissa reveals the story of his blue pearl to Pi and he gave it to his wife, but she got hooked in the open sea. Nerissa desperately tried to call for help, but no one was brave enough to help. Pi understands, but is unsure how to stop Troy for good; Nerissa tells him to offer Troy something he wants and then give him something he doesn't want. Cordelia finds Pi and tries to convince him to reconsider, willing to sacrifice herself for his life. That night Pearl's pearl has been stolen by Troy's henchmen. She is heartbroken, being as Dylan's father gave her the pearl. Pi realizes that he cannot back down now no matter how much everyone else doubts him. After mastering the ways of the ocean, Cordelia, Dylan, Thornton, Buddy, Lou and the marlins (who reveal they were once friends of Nerissa's), band together to stop Troy's crew in a final showdown. Pi initiates a chase with Troy. As Pi swims away from Troy through the valley Nerissa instructed him to take, Troy is hit by all of the obstacles until they get to the open sea. Nerissa tries to help by throwing an old boot at Troy's henchmen Bart and Eddie, and Dylan shoves them down a lobster hole, retrieving his mother's pearl in the process. Pi is then swatted by Troy's tail into a cliff, burying him in rocks. Nerissa attempts to help him, but is hit by Troy; just as all seems lost the marlins arrive to fight Troy and apologize to Nerissa for not helping him when he needed them. Percy and Meg return and free Pi. Troy then sets Percy as a target. Pi sees a net and plans to trick Troy into it. Pi distracts Troy who believes Pi is doomed since they are now in open water. Troy chases him up to the surface, where he manages to lead Troy into a fishing net and narrowly escapes the shark's jaws as he leaps through the top of the net. Troy, trapped in the net, is lifted from the sea. Pi is proclaimed a hero by the population of the reef who all mock Troy believing that he will be made into seafood. Nerissa admits he sees Pi as his son and gives him his pearl. Pi is honored and does not know what to say. Nerissa states that Pi knows exactly what to say, but he is just not the one to whom he needs to be saying it. Pi presents Cordelia with the pearl and she accepts it, they share a kiss as the reef celebrates, including a redeemed Bart and Eddie, which rejoice that they are all free from Troy.

These days he writes for TechCrunch, but he also founded the popular Photocritic photography blog, wrote a series of books about photography, and for starting the Triggertrap company. Short bio Born in Leiderdorp, South Holland to parents Hielke Kamps and Lizeth Rovers, Haje moved to Norway in 1988 when he was seven years old, and to the UK in 2001 when he was nineteen. In England, he studied Journalism at Liverpool John Moores University, and started a stint working in publishing and media. He now lives in San Francisco, California Media career In 1998 when he was sixteen, Kamps discovered that there weren't any decent websites about photography in Norwegian, and decided that he could do better. He, together with Martin Lexow Wirak, started Digitalkamera.no, a major Norwegian technology news and reviews website about digital photography which later evolved into akam.no. In 2002, while working at Granada Television, on a Coronation Street specials series, Kamps started a website called Photocritic, which became extremely popular in December 2005, when it was featured on Slashdot, and subsequently got heavy coverage on Digg and dozens of other large blogs. It was later awarded the best DIY photography gadget in Lifehacker. The Photocritic.org photography blog continues to be popular., but was purchased by Sterling Publishing, and is now hosted at Pixiq, where Kamps posts regularly. In 2007, Kamps wrote a book on macro photography for John Wiley & Sons publishing, entitled Macro Photography Photo Workshop (). He has worked at Future Publishing as web editor for Fast Car Magazine and T3 magazine, and then as a senior producer at Five, the British TV channel. At Five, Kamps was the senior producer on the highly successful FiveFWD website. Kamps still works as a freelance (ghost-)writer and editorial consultant. He also acts as a guest in different photography competitions. But in 2011, he created Triggertrap, which now commands most of his time.

The character and the events she goes through are loosely based on the actual historical figure Pocahontas. Pocahontas, as the daughter of a Native American paramount chief of the Powhatan paramountcy, is the first American Disney Princess. Pocahontas is also the first Disney Princess to have two love interests. In both films she is voiced by and physically modeled after Native American actress Irene Bedard, and her singing vocals were performed by Broadway singer Judy Kuhn. Pocahontas is the seventh member of the Disney Princess line-up. Development =Conception and writing= A portrait engraving of the actual Pocahontas. Following his directorial debut with The Rescuers Down Under (1990), Mike Gabriel happened upon an image of Pocahontas in a history book and decided that he wanted to pitch a film about her to Disney executives. Feeling that he was not adept at drawing women, he went to the pitch meeting with a Xeroxed image of Tiger Lily from Peter Pan (1953) which he added animals to. His one sentence pitch for the film was: \\"An Indian princess falls in love with an English settler, then is torn between her father's wish to destroy the settlers and her need to help them.\\" When Disney executives asked Gabriel to summarize Pocahontas' character, he replied: \\"She's a girl with a problem.\\" Inspired by William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, the film's directors Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg wanted the story of Pocahontas to feature two characters of very different backgrounds falling in love. Story supervisor Tom Sito, who became the project's unofficial historical consultant, did extensive research into the early colonial era and the story of John Smith and Pocahontas, and was confronted over the historical inaccuracies from historians. Already knowing that in reality Pocahontas married John Rolfe, Gabriel explained it was felt that \\"the story of Pocahontas and Rolfe was too complicated and violent for a youthful audience\\" so instead, they would focus on Pocahontas's meeting with John Smith. While the real Pocahontas was eleven or twelve years old upon meeting John Smith, she is depicted as being around eighteen or nineteen years of age in the film, according to her supervising animator Glen Keane. Keane explained that this change was made because a film wherein a thirty year-old Smith falls in love with a child would be \\"sleazy\\". Roy E. Disney felt that making the character older than the historical figure would make the film \\"more dramatic\\". Disney sought to consult Native American actors and a Native American organization in an attempt to accurately portray Indigenous culture onscreen. Elaine Dutka of the Los Angeles Times theorized that this decision was made due to the negative reception of Aladdin (1992) by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee; Disney denied Dutka's theory. Native American activist Russell Means who plays Pocahontas' father Powhatan in the film, suggested that Pocahontas say she was \\"honored\\" by a gift Powhatan gives in a scene of the film to reflect the ways that Native Americans talked; Disney changed the film's script in accordance with Means' suggestion. Michael Eisner pushed for Pocahontas to have a mother, lamenting that \\"We're always getting fried for having no mothers.\\" The writers countered that Powhatan was polygamous and formed dynastic alliances among other neighboring tribes by impregnating a local woman and giving away the child, so it was believed that Pocahontas herself probably did not see her mother that much. Storyboard artist Joe Grant would conceive the idea of the swirling leaves to represent Pocahontas's mother. Pocahontas became the first Native American Disney Princess and the first woman of color to be the lead character in a Disney film. As of 2014, she remains the only Disney Princess to be based on a historical figure. =Personality and design= Animator Glen Keane likened Pocahontas to a tribal version of Eve. Keane also wanted Pocahontas to be written as a confident adult, unlike Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) or Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991). The film's producer, Jim Pentacost, viewed the character as \\"the strongest heroine we've ever had in a Disney film.\\" Disney spokesman Howard Green said that the studio desired for the film to portray its Native American characters in a \\"real\\" and \\"fair\\" way, in contrast to the \\"very comic, broad\\" and inaccurate portrayal of Native Americans in Peter Pan (1953). Green also said that the studio did not want the film to reinforce stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America. The film's crew met with Ray Adams, the chairman of the United Indians of Virginia, and showed him ten minutes of unfinished animation and the song \\"Colors of the Wind\\" to see if they had portrayed Pocahontas in a way which would not be offensive. Adams felt that the character's outfits were an accurate representation of Native American clothing and commented that Pocahontas was shown as \\"very beautiful and very intelligent and very loving, which the Native Americans are. We usually aren't portrayed as being loving, but the settlers would not have survived the first three winters if we had not been loving and helped them.\\" Renowned for animating female characters such as Ariel, supervising animator Glen Keane was immediately tapped to draw the titular Indian princess. Following the demands of Jeffrey Katzenberg to make the title character \\"the most idealized and finest woman ever made\\", Keane first began to sought his inspirations for his depictions for Pocahontas from Shirley 'Little Dove' Custalow-McGowan and Devi White Dove, women he had met during the research trip to Virginia. Keane recalled meeting the women: > So I turned around and there's this beautiful Indian woman walking up; a > Native American. She said 'Are you Glen Keane? The animator that's going to > do Pocahontas?' I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree > another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, > and this is my sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from > Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of > them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind ‚Äì I could see > her. Other inspirations were Christy Turlington, Natalie Belcon, Naomi Campbell, Jamie Pillow, white supermodel Kate Moss, Charmaine Craig, and Irene Bedard, who provided the character's speaking voice. Keane also looked to a 1620 depiction of Pocahontas from a history book, though Keane would state she was \\"not exactly a candidate for Peoples 'Most Beautiful' issue [so] I made a few adjustments to add an Asian feeling to her face.\\" Pocahontas and all her tribesmen were depicted barefoot in the movie, presumably to signify their connection to nature. Due to the complexity of the color schemes, shapes, and expressions in the animation, a total of 55 animators worked on the design of Pocahontas' character alone, including Mark Henn and Pres Romanillos. Filipina college student Dyna Taylor was paid $200 to model for the character. She was given an image of the character that Keane autographed with the words \\"To Dyna, with gratitude for the inspiration you gave us.\\" Disappointed that she was not credited in the film, Taylor considered suing Disney but was advised against doing so by a lawyer she consulted. Keane told The New York Times that he deemed Taylor's contributions to the film unworthy of a screen credit. Keane felt that the final version of the character was akin to a tribal version of Eve and less sexual and more athletic than earlier Disney character Jessica Rabbit. Themes Pocahontas has been identified as a feminist character who stands up against her father's patriarchal views in her refusal to marry the man her father wants her to marry. Megan Condis, assistant professor of English at Stephen F. Austin State University, has stated that compared to previous Disney Princesses \\"Pocahontas was definitely a very different type of character in that she isn't as defined by romantic relationships and she's a lot more active. Also, she is one of the first princesses to actually take an active role in governing.\\" Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic opined that in creating the character \\"Disney had, for the first time, provided an independent and fearless heroine with a strong sense of self.\\" Gilbert noted that unlike Snow White or Cinderella, Pocahontas is able to find happiness outside of marriage. MTV's Lauren Vino noted that Pocahontas is not a damsel in distress, as she saves Smith's life rather than vice versa. Upon the twentieth anniversary of Pocahontas, The A.V. Club Caroline Siede said that the film \\"remains probably the most high profile story of a Native American in pop culture.\\" Tom Brook of the BBC said that the character's portrayal was impacted by how \\"[t]he rights of Native Americans were strengthened in the two decades from the mid-1970s by legislation protecting tribal rights and interests\\". Appearances =Pocahontas= Pocahontas in Mickey and the Magical Map at Disneyland in 2014. In the beginning of the film, Pocahontas learns that Kocoum, one of her father's bravest warriors, has asked to marry her. (In place of a wedding ring, Pocahontas is given her deceased mother's wedding necklace, and she wears it throughout most of the film.) However, Pocahontas does not feel that this is the right path for her. She is the first one to spot the ship carrying the Europeans, mistaking the ship's sails for clouds. Pocahontas later encounters one of the settlers, John Smith. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that her mother has died and that she lives with her father. Over time, the two get to know each other, asking all sorts of questions about each other's people, lives, and different worlds. However, the conversation goes sour when John Smith unintentionally reveals his prejudices towards Native Americans. Pocahontas explains to him the beauty and importance of nature and respecting the earth through the song, \\"Colors of the Wind\\". This causes John to see the ill of his thoughts and change his ways, and the two fall in love with each other. When Kocoum stumbles upon Pocahontas and John Smith kissing, he becomes enraged and attacks the white man. Pocahontas attempts to break them up, but Thomas, who had been sent to find John, shoots and kills Kocoum. John Smith takes the blame for Kocoum's death, is arrested by Chief Powhatan's men, and sentenced to death by beheading at sunrise. Pocahontas realizes that she must stop the execution that will lead to war between the Native Americans and the settlers. She runs to where the execution takes place, calling out to the forces of nature to help her reach them in time. Pocahontas reaches John Smith just in time to throw herself over him and save him from being decapitated by her father, who then comes to his senses and releases Smith. When, enraged, Governor Ratcliffe shoots at the chief, John Smith pushes Powhatan out of the way and takes the bullet instead. Soon after, a wounded John Smith asks her to come with him to England, but she explains that her place is in Virginia, with her people. To comfort him, she tells him that \\"no matter what happens, I'll always be with you, forever\\". They kiss, and the men carry him onto the ship. As it is leaving, Pocahontas runs as fast as she can to a cliff overlooking the ocean. John waves goodbye in the Powhatan fashion, and Pocahontas waves back in the Powhatan fashion, as she showed him earlier when the two first met. =Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World= In Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World, Pocahontas goes to London as a diplomat to stop a potential attack upon her people being ordered by King James in a plot by Ratcliffe. There, she is accompanied by John Rolfe and slowly develops a romance with him. In the end, she is reunited with John Smith but explains to him that they are \\"no longer following the same path that they went on years ago\\", and parts ways with him. Successfully exposing Ratcliffe, who is then arrested by order of the King, Pocahontas and John Rolfe get on a ship going back to Virginia together, and kiss as the ship sails off into the sunset. Other appearances She is featured in Disney's Hollywood Studios nighttime fireworks stage show Fantasmic! and World of Color at Disney's California Adventure Park. She makes cameo appearances in numerous episodes of the Disney's House of Mouse television series. She appears daily at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in Frontierland and at Disney‚Äôs Animal Kingdom for meet and greets alongside Meeks and John Smith. She is the most common Pocahontas character, next to Meeko. She and John Smith appear in the Disney Cruise Line stage show The Golden Mickeys. She is also known to come out for meet-and-greets on the ships. Pocahontas, Meeko, and Flit make cameo appearances in the Hong Kong Disneyland version of It's a Small World. She had her own show entitled \\"Pocahontas and her Forest Friends\\" at Disney's Animal Kingdom, which ran from 1998 to 2008. Pocahontas appears in several stories of Disney's 365 Bedtime Stories.

The charge for the package was a one-time $69 charge per year. Description Viewers were able to watch games which did not air on their CBS affiliate, and Mega March Madness also had a multiplex channel allowing all four games to be framed on the same screen. Game coverage still used CBS coverage and announcers, though DirecTV promotional advertising replaced CBS station local breaks and the games were uninterrupted by in-game analysis or a cut-over to a more compelling game like was done on the main CBS broadcasts. Decline and discontinuation In many markets however, CBS also provided sub-feeds of games for affiliates to air on digital subchannels or secondary sister stations. Though these games featured regular advertising and analysis and were only aired in standard definition, it was regarded as duplicative and as the stations offered the coverage for free, Mega March Madness was among the lowest-subscribed DirectTV sports packages as many viewers utilized a secondary cable connection or antenna to receive the games without charge, although in latter years CBS only allowed stations coverage of one further game on a digital subchannel to protect the Mega March Madness package. Further development of streaming of all games over video on demand on the Internet cut further into the package's appeal. After the 2010 tournament, Mega March Madness was discontinued, as the NCAA's new tournament deal with CBS and the networks of Turner Broadcasting System (TBS, TNT, and truTV),NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament Expands To 68 Teams; CBS Adds Turner To Television Team press release via TV by the Numbers called NCAA March Madness, facilitated national coverage of every game on a cable or broadcast channel without cut-aways or staggered scheduling, making the Mega March Madness package superfluous.Turner Networks To Air 41 March Madness Tournament Games Multichannel News February 10, 2011 External links *March Madness on Demand References CBS Sports College basketball on television in the United States Television channels and stations established in 2002 Television channels and stations disestablished in 2010 Out-of-market sports packages ","title":"Mega March Madness"},{"id":"9734965","text":"The W3C Device Description Working Group (DDWG), operating as part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Mobile Web Initiative (MWI), was chartered to \\"foster the provision and access to device descriptions that can be used in support of Web-enabled applications that provide an appropriate user experience on mobile devices.\\" Mobile devices exhibit the greatest diversity of capabilities, and therefore present the greatest challenge to content adaptation technologies.

History  Scanair was founded in Denmark in June 1961 and was partially owned by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). The first aircraft operated was the Douglas DC-7 for charter flights to Spain, North Africa, and the United States. In 1965 the headquarters was moved to Stockholm and SAS supplied Scanair with Douglas DC-8 aircraft. Soon thereafter two Boeing 727 joined the growing fleet and Scanair soon became the biggest charter company in Scandinavia. Other destinations served throughout the years the Canary Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the winter resorts of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. To increase capacity the Airbus A300 was acquired but the A300's range was not sufficient for the needs and those were soon replaced with Douglas DC-10s. Scanair grew so much that by the 1980s was carrying over 2 million passengers a year, but that was not enough to turn a profit so it mergers with the Danish airline Conair of Scandinavia on January 1, 1994.

He graduated from Fort Vancouver High School in Vancouver, Washington. Hunter, who threw and batted right-handed, was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 2nd round (35th Overall) of the 1989 amateur draft. Hunter spent a little over five and a half seasons in the minor leagues. He began his pro career with the Gulf Coast League Astros in 1989. Hunter then went on to spend the next three seasons in class A playing for the Asheville Tourists of the South Atlantic League in 1990 and then the Osceola Astros of the Florida State League for two seasons 1991‚Äì1992. After a season in Class AA with the Jackson Generals of the Texas League, Hunter moved up to Class AAA and played part of the season with the Pacific Coast League's Tucson Toros in 1994. Major league career Hunter made his major league debut for the Astros on June 27, 1994 against the Cincinnati Reds. In five at bats he contributed with one hit, and stole his first base in this game.

She played Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson on The Wire and wrote a 2007 memoir, Grace After Midnight, detailing her troubled childhood and time in prison for second-degree murder. Early life Pearson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of two incarcerated drug addicts, and was raised in an East Baltimore foster home. Born a premature crack baby weighing three pounds, she was not expected to live. She was so small that she was fed with an eyedropper until she could be fed normally. According to her memoir, Grace After Midnight, she met her biological parents very few times, her mother was a crack addict, and her father was an armed robber. As a result of this, she decided to go by her foster family's surname. Pearson was a tomboy from a young age and worked as a drug dealer as a teenager. At the age of sixteen, she was convicted of second degree murder after the shooting of a girl named Okia Toomer and was sentenced to two eight-year terms, to be served consecutively, at the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women in Jessup, Maryland. She was released after six and a half years. Pearson said her life turned around at the age of eighteen, when Arnold Loney, a local drug dealer who looked out for her and sent her money in prison, was shot and killed. He had coined her nickname \\"Snoop\\", because she reminded him of Charlie Brown's beagle Snoopy in the comic strip Peanuts. While in prison, Pearson earned her GED. She was released in 2000, and landed a local job fabricating car bumpers, but was fired after two weeks when her employer learned she had a prison record. Career =Television= Pearson met Michael K. Williams, who played Omar Little on The Wire, in a Baltimore club. He invited her to come to the set one day, and introduced her to the writers and the producers. After subsequent auditions, she was offered a role in the series. For her performance in The Wire, Stephen King called her \\"perhaps the most terrifying female villain to ever appear in a television series.\\" Her appearance on the show kickstarted her acting career, leading to appearances in music videos for R&B; singer Lil' Mo's \\"Dem Boyz,\\" rapper Rick Ross' \\"The Boss,\\" and \\"Here I Am,\\" rapper Ace Hood's \\"Cash Flow\\", A$AP Ferg's \\"Shabba (feat ASAP Rocky)\\" and Snoop Dogg‚Äôs \\"So Many Pros\\".https://hiphopwired.com/459205/the-wire-actors-in- music-videos/ She has appeared in the Spike Lee films Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, and Chi-Raq, and in the CBS police procedural drama Blue Bloods, titled \\"Good Cop Bad Cop\\". Pearson joined the cast of the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York for its seventh and eighth seasons. =Music= Pearson is featured in the song \\"It's A Stick Up\\" with Tony Yayo and Mazaradi Fox, with its music video featuring clips from The Wire. =Volunteer work= Pearson has volunteered as a prison visitor, worked on anti-violence and literary campaigns for youth, and supported The Stay Strong Foundation. Personal life On March 10, 2011, Pearson and sixty others were arrested and charged with drug offenses. The arrest was made during a predawn raid at her home in Baltimore, following a five-month DEA operation. At the first hearing after Pearson's arrest, Judge John Addison Howard denied her bail due to Pearson's acting ability, stating: \\"Well, you can change your appearance, I've seen the episodes of The Wire in which you appear. You look very different than you do here today, and I'm not talking about the jumpsuit, I'm talking about your general appearance.\\" After a month in jail, Pearson was offered bail of $50,000 on April 8, 2011. In August 2011, she pleaded guilty to the charges the day before her trial was to begin. She was sentenced to a suspended seven-year prison term, with credit for time served, and given three years of supervised probation. Pearson is a lesbian, and has an autobiography, Grace After Midnight.

The victim‚Äîwhose murder is approximated to have occurred in 1941‚Äîremains unidentified, and the current location of her skeleton and autopsy report is unknown. Discovery On 18 April 1943, four local boys (Robert Hart, Thomas Willetts, Bob Farmer and Fred Payne) were poaching or bird‚Äìnesting in Hagley Wood, part of the Hagley estate belonging to Lord Cobham near to Wychbury Hill when they came across a large wych elm. Thinking the location to be a particularly good place to hunt birds' nests, Farmer attempted to climb the tree to investigate. As he climbed, he glanced down into the hollow trunk and discovered a skull. At first he believed it to be that of an animal, but after seeing human hair and teeth, he realised that he had found a human skull. As they were on the land illegally, Farmer put the skull back and all four boys returned home without mentioning their discovery to anybody. However, on returning home, the youngest of the boys, Willetts, felt uneasy about what he had witnessed and decided to report the find to his parents.  Investigation  The skull of \\"Wych Elm Bella,\\" as retrieved 18 April 1943 When police checked the trunk of the tree they found an almost complete skeleton, with a shoe, a gold wedding ring, and some fragments of clothing. The skull was valuable evidence, in that it still had some tufts of hair and had a clear dental pattern, despite some missing teeth. After further investigation, the remains of a hand were found some distance from the tree. The body was sent for forensic examination by Prof. James Webster. He quickly established that it was that of a female who had been dead for at least 18 months, placing time of death in or before October 1941; Webster also discovered a section of taffeta in her mouth, suggesting that she had died from suffocation. From the measurement of the trunk in which the body had been discovered, he also deduced that she must have been placed there \\"still warm\\" after the killing, as she could not have fitted once rigor mortis had taken hold. Police could tell from items found with the body what the woman had looked like, but with so many people reported missing during the war, records were too vast for a proper identification to take place. They cross-referenced the details they had with reports of missing persons throughout the region, but none of them seemed to match the evidence. In addition, they contacted dentists all over the country since the dentistry was quite distinctive. In 1944 a graffiti message, related to the mystery, appeared on a wall in Upper Dean Street, Birmingham, reading Who put Bella down the Wych Elm - Hagley Wood. This led investigators down several new leads tracing who Bella could have been. Other messages in the same hand appeared too. Since at least the 1970s, the graffiti has sporadically appeared on the Hagley Obelisk near to where the woman's body was discovered, which asks the slightly modified Who put Bella in the Witch Elm?. = Facial reconstruction = An episode of the television programme Nazi Murder Mysteries described a forensic facial reconstruction undertaken by the Liverpool John Moores University's \\"Face Lab\\", from photographs of the skull. It was commissioned by Andrew Sparke, for his books on the incident.  Theories  The Lyttelton Arms, Hagley In a Radio 4 programme first broadcast in August 2014, Steve Punt suggested two possible victims. One possible victim was reported to the police in 1944 by a Birmingham prostitute. In the report, she stated that another prostitute called Bella, who worked on the Hagley Road, had disappeared about three years previously. The name ‚ÄúBella‚Äù (or ‚ÄúLuebella‚Äù) suggested the graffiti artist was probably aware of the identity of the victim or of the killer. A second possibility came from a statement made to police in 1953 by Una Mossop, in which she said that her ex-husband Jack Mossop had confessed to family members that he and a Dutchman called van Ralt had put the woman in the tree. Mossop and van Ralt met for a drink at the Lyttelton Arms (a pub in Hagley). Later that night, Mossop said the woman became drunk, and passed out while they were driving. The men put her in a hollow tree in the woods in the hope that in the morning she would wake up and be frightened into seeing the error of her ways. Jack Mossop was confined to a Stafford mental hospital, because he had recurring dreams of a woman staring out at him from a tree. He died in the hospital before the body in the wych elm was found. The likelihood of this being the correct explanation is questioned because Una Mossop did not come forward with this information until more than 10 years after Jack Mossop's death. Another theory comes from an MI5 declassified file about Josef Jakobs - the last man to be put to death in the Tower of London on 15 August 1941. An Abwehr agent, he parachuted into Cambridgeshire in 1941 but broke his ankle when landing and was soon arrested by the Home Guard. On his person was found a photo purportedly of his lover, a German cabaret singer and actress named Clara Bauerle. Jakobs said that she was being trained as a spy and that, had he made contact, she might have been sent over to England after him. However, there is no evidence that Clara Bauerle was parachuted into England, and several witnesses describe that Clara Bauerle was around tall, while Bella was . In September 2016, it was determined that Clara Bauerle had died in Berlin on 16 December 1942. In 1945, Margaret Murray, an anthropologist and archaeologist from University College London, proposed a more radical theory‚Äîwitchcraft‚Äîwhere the severed hand was consistent with a ritual called the Hand of Glory, after Bella had been killed by gypsies during an occult ritual. Her ideas excited the local press and led investigators to consult another seemingly ritualistic killing of a man, Charles Walton, in nearby Lower Quinton. In 1953, another theory surfaced, namely that Bella was a Dutchwoman named Clarabella Dronkers, killed by a German spy-ring consisting of a British officer, a Dutchman and a music hall artist, for \\"knowing too much.\\" Available records and evidence were unable to support the story. Popular culture \\"Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm\\" was cited as a direct influence on the 2018 novel The Wych Elm, by Tana French. The case was the topic of the fourth episode of season six of web series BuzzFeed Unsolved, under the title; The Creepy Quandary of Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm.

Vandenbergh et al. in 1975, in which an early induction of the first estrous cycle in prepubertal female mice occurs as a result of exposure to the pheromone-laden urine of a sexually mature (dominant) male mouse. Physiologically, the exposure to male urine induces the release of GnRH, which provokes the first estrus. The Vandenbergh effect has also been seen with exposure to adult female mice. When an immature female mouse is exposed to the urine of mature female mouse, estrus is delayed in the prepubertal female. In this situation, GnRH is inhibited and therefore delays puberty in the juvenile female mouse.An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology, 3rd edition. Randy J. Nelson. Sinauer Associates, 2005. The Vandenbergh effect is caused by pheromones found in a male's urine. The male does not have to be present for this effect to take place; the urine alone is sufficient. These pheromones are detected by the vomeronasal organ in the septum of the female's nose. This occurs because the female body will only take the step to begin puberty if there are available mates around. She will not waste energy on puberty if there is no possibility of finding a mate. In addition to GnRH, exogenous estradiol has recently implicated as having a role in the Vandenbergh effect. Utilizing tritium-labeled estradiol implanted in male mice, researchers have been able to trace the pathways the estradiol takes once transmitted to a female. The estradiol was found in a multitude of regions within the females and appeared to enter her circulation nasally and through the skin. Their findings suggested that some aspects of the Vandenbergh effect as well as the Bruce effect may be related to exogenous estradiol from males. Additional studies have looked into the validity of estradiol's role in the Vandenbergh effect by means of exogenous estradiol placed in castrated rats. Castrated males were injected with either a control (oil) or estradiol in the oil vehicle. As expected, urinary androgens in the castrated males were below normal levels. Additionally, castration by itself rid the males of the capacity to induce growth of the uterus in prepubescent females or to disrupt implantation of the blastocyst in females that had previously been inseminated. However, when resupplied with estradiol, the castrated males regained the ability to induce uterine growth or halt blastocyst implantation. These studies further support estradiol's role in mediating the Vandenbergh effect (as well as the Bruce effect).

For specific concerns or questions about official government flight policy, refer to the official circular at the Office of Management and Budget As stated in the circular, government aircraft are to be used for \\"defined official purposes\\", which is restricted to three categories:OMB Circular A-126, Section 5: Definitions (22 May 1992)OMB Circular A-126, Section 7: Use of Government Aircraft (22 May 1992) # \\"[T]ravel to meet mission requirements\\" i.e., travel to discharge an agency's official responsibilities # \\"[R]equired use travel\\" i.e., government aircraft are required to meet \\"bona fide communications or security needs\\" or as dictated by \\"exceptional scheduling requirements\\" # \\"[O]ther travel for the conduct of agency business\\" There are outlined specifics that define \\"official travel\\" that must meet these specific criteria:OMB Circular A-126, Section 8: Travel on Government Aircraft (22 May 1992) * when no commercial airline or aircraft (including charter) service is reasonably available; specifically any schedule that does not meet the traveler's departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24-hour period * the cost of government aircraft usage is not more than the cost of using commercial airline or aircraft, including charter flights * aircraft may not be used on a \\"space available\\" basis unless: ** the aircraft is already scheduled for an official purpose ** the \\"space available\\" does not require a larger aircraft than needed ** the \\"space available\\" use results in a minor additional cost to the government =Cost and reimbursement= The following conditions are not considered official business and require reimbursement to the government: * incidental private travel activities of an employee undertaken while on official travel that result in increased operating costs * wholly personal or political trips (reimbursement level set at \\"the full coach fare\\") * official trip during which political activities are attended and engaged in (the appropriate share of the full coach fare) * in which the employee flies to one or more locations for personal reasons (the excess of the full coach fare for all flights taken above the cost of the full coach fare to official business destinations) The government is reimbursed for the cost or portion of the \\"full coach fare\\" applicable to the time not spent on required use travel.OMB Circular A-126, Section 9: Reimbursement for Use of Government Aircraft (22 May 1992) The \\"full coach fare\\" is defined as the cost of a ticket on a commercial airline available to the general public between the time the travel was planned and the day the travel was taken. For political travel, other laws and regulations may apply that require reimbursement in an amount greater than the \\"full coach fare\\". =Approval and documentation for government travel= Typically only an agency head or officials that are designated by the agency head may approve the use of agency aircraft, but government aircraft may also be used when it is also designated to transport senior Federal officials, members of their families or other non- Federal travelers on a \\"space available\\" basis but only when a written certification is presented by the agency. This certification must show that the mission activity is bona fide and that the minimum mission requirements are not surpassed to transport the additional travelers not required for official business. In emergency situations, this certification may be produced after-the-fact.OMB Circular A-126, Section 10: Approving the Use of Government Aircraft (22 May 1992) At a minimum, those individuals appointed by the agency head must be one organizational level above the person(s) traveling. If this is not possible, then another appropriate approval is required. Travel requests must also be approved in advance and in writing. This approval must be done on a trip-by-trip basis from the agency's senior legal official or their principal deputy. There are two exceptions:OMB Circular A-126, Section 11: Approving Travel on Government Aircraft (22 May 1992) * the agency head has determined that all travel by the individual qualifies as required use travel or * the President has determined that all travel by the agency head qualifies as required use. All use of government aircraft by agencies must be reported semi-annually to the General Services Administration (GSA). These reports must be formatted within GSA standards and must list the following information for trips taken during the preceding six-month period: * name of each traveler * official purpose of trip * destination(s) * the appropriate allocated share of the full operating cost of the trip In addition to the GSA, summary data of these reports must also be submitted semi-annually to the OMB in the same format. The exception to this rule are any classified trips, which then must be maintained by the agency and be made available for review under authorization. For all uses of federal aircraft, the following documentation must be retained for a minimum of two years:OMB Circular A-126, Section 12: Documenting the Use of Government Aircraft (22 May 1992) * tail number of the plane used * date(s) used * name(s) of pilot(s) and flight crew * purpose(s) of the flight * the route(s) flown * names of all passengers =Eligibility= Status as a federal employee does not automatically result in authorization for use of government aircraft. There are three categories of people who require advance authorization in writing: * senior Federal officials * members of their families * non-Federal travelers All authorizations must conform to the same policies as authorized agency travel. In this circular, the term 'Senior Official' is defined by anyone employed by an Executive or independent agency at a payrate of Level I of the Executive Schedule or employed in the Executive Office of the President at a payrate of Level II of the Executive Schedule (). Simply put, a 'Senior Official' is anyone who meets the criteria as being employed and paid at a rate equal to or greater than the basic pay equivalent to a member of the Senior Executive Service (). Active duty military officers are exempted from this definition. =Audit responsibility= All agency officials with the statutory authority to procure aircraft must ensure that their policies and procedures comply with the requirements of OMB Circular A-76, and that those programs comply with the internal control requirements of OMB Circular A-123. Any material weaknesses must be reported to the President and the United States Congress.OMB Circular A-126, Section 13: Responsibilities (22 May 1992) The development of policies and procedures must be done in cooperation with the GSA. If the agency does not have systems that conform to these policies, a period of one year from the date of issuance of GSA standards is given to implement those systems. =Accounting= Those systems which are implemented that conform to GSA standards must permit justification of use of government aircraft services and the determination of usage over commercial or alternative government aircraft; recovery of operation costs of the aircraft; the cost-effectiveness of their aircraft program; and cost-comparison to justify in-house operation of government aircraft in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.OMB Circular A-126, Section 14: Accounting for Aircraft Costs (22 May 1992) History =Use by Speaker of the House= Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, air transportation security has become a major issue for all aspects of American culture, including government transportation. Because of concerns for safety of elected government officials, the Speaker of the House‚Äînext in line behind the Vice President in the order of succession‚Äîhas been granted use of military planes for secure travel services. Nancy Pelosi In February 2007, a controversy arose regarding the capability of aircraft for travel requested by newly elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). The previous speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), flew in a C-20 which is a modified version of a Gulfstream III. Pelosi requested an upgrade from this plane, which is incapable of flying non-stop the required 2,800+ miles to Pelosi's home district of San Francisco, California. There was some question as to whether or not Pelosi's friends and associates would be allowed to travel with her, and that further consultation with the Air Force, and Department of Defense would be required. =Trump administration= After a number of news articles detailing the cost of flights on charter and government-owned aircraft, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter to the Trump administration, questioning recent travel by Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Other administration officials named as having recently taken charter, military, or private aircraft were Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. The acting chief of the Office of Government Ethics, David J. Apol, issued a letter to agency heads asking them to ensure their actions are \\"motivated by the public good and not by personal interests.\\" Tom Price In a series of reports starting in September 2017, Politico reported that since May 2017, Price had expended more than $1 million of Department funds for travel on private charter jets and military aircraft. Many of the flights were between cities that are easily accessible by train or car and have frequent, low-cost commercial airline service. The reports from Politico sparked a larger inquiry into the use of private planes by Trump administration officials. The House Oversight Committee started a bipartisan investigation led by Representatives Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) of all use of private and government-owned planes by non-elected government officials of the Executive Branch on September 26, citing , which states \\"The travel of an employee shall be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and shall be commensurate with the nature and purpose of the duties of the employee requiring such travel.\\" Senator Grassley's letter to the White House asked to \\"detail what steps the administration has taken to ensure that cabinet secretaries use the most fiscally responsible travel in accordance with the public trust they hold and the spirit and letter of all laws, regulations, and policies that apply.\\" Price vowed to pay back $52,000, the cost of his share of travel that was \\"approved through the normal process\\". On September 29, Price resigned following what reporters called \\"an optics nightmare\\" for \\"the appearance of a millionaire Cabinet secretary flying routes easily navigated by far cheaper means.\\" Steven Mnuchin After his wife, Louise Linton, posted a controversial photograph on August 21, 2017, to Instagram showing her deplaning a government jet in Kentucky, the Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened up an inquiry into Mnuchin's use of government aircraft. Mnuchin reimbursed the government for Linton's travel to Kentucky. According to the OIG's review, the total cost of the operating the Gulfstream C-37B to Louisville and Fort Knox was $26,900. The reimbursement of Linton's cost of travel was $595.90, as the typical reimbursement paid by requesting federal executive agencies only covers the cost of an equivalent coach ticket on a commercial flight. The OIG released its report on October 4, 2017, concluding that there was \\"no violation of law in these requests and uses\\" of government aircraft by Mnuchin, but also expressing concern regarding \\"a disconnect between the standard of proof called for in the Daley memo and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests\\". The referenced Daley Memo was issued by then-White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley on April 4, 2011, and it stated the standards for use of government aircraft by senior executive branch officials were given in OMB Circular A-126, dated February 10, 1993. The Daley Memo also states that travel using military aircraft must be considered a White House Support Mission, taken at the specific direction of the President under one of a set of limited circumstances that \\"make commercial transportation unacceptable\\". In the report, the OIG reviewed nine travel requests by Mnuchin for military air transportation since March 2017, of which seven were approved and taken, one was withdrawn, and one was approved with travel pending in late October 2017. The total cost of the seven trips taken was $811,800, calculated from per-hour cost and operating hours for the specific aircraft, or Air Force-provided direct costs of operations.

Background Maria was born into a period of constant political turmoil. The civil life of Vallecorsa was marred by the feuding of a number of competing factions. The small kingdoms and republics on the Italian peninsula were constantly at war with one another. Commerce was disrupted; in the face of economic uncertainty and lack of steady work, young men who found it easier to live by banditry joined those who were outlaws for political reasons, holed up in mountain enclaves. They lived by raiding and intimidating the peasants and villagers. Gang leaders became popular and romantic figures.\\"St Maria de Mattias - 1805-1866\\" Biography =Early years= De Mattias was born 4 February 1805 in Vallecorsa, in the Province of Frosinone, Italy, to a religious and upper-class family\\"Maria De Mattias\\", Vatican News Service which valued education. She was the second of four children of Giovanni de Mattias and Ottavia de Angelis. Because her family had property and wealth, it was not safe for Maria and her brothers to play outside‚Äîthe bandits made a practice of kidnapping children for ransom. Although women during her time did not normally receive a formal education, she was able to teach herself how to read and write. In her mid-teens, she was withdrawn and focused more on her looks than religion. She was proud of her long blond hair, and spent hours before her mirror, posing and arranging her clothes. However, at the age of 16 she was inspired by a mystical vision and began to break out from her sheltered upbringing. =Religious life= In 1822 Saint Gaspar del Bufalo, C.PP.S., founder of the Missionaries of the Precious Blood, preached a mission in her town. De Mattias decided that she would devote her life to caring for the needy and spreading the word of God. Through the preaching of Gaspar del Bufalo on devotion to the Precious Blood of Jesus, Maria De Mattias was drawn to see this mystery of Christ's life as a model for self-sacrifice. On March 4, 1834, at the age of 29, under the guidance of del Bufalo's successor, the Venerable Giovanni Merlini, C.PP.S., she founded the Congregation of the Sisters Adorers of the Blood of Christ to advance this service. She had been called by the Administrator of Anagni, Bishop Giuseppe Maria Lais, to teach the young girls‚Äîshe had learned to read and write on her own. The religious order was founded as an apostolic order, an active teaching order, rather than a monastic order. In 1855 the young order received papal approval. Maria De Mattias made a public vow of chastity, receiving a gold heart imprinted with three drops of blood. The symbol was given to her by John Merlini, CPPS, her spiritual director who later served as superior general of the Precious Blood Missionaries. A silver heart is still worn by the sisters around the globe.\\"History of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ\\", Newman University Mother Matilda spent over 30 years travelling throughout Italy to help establish communities of her Sisters. This involved treks ranging from walking long distances to taking treacherous journeys on donkeys. She was so eager to proclaim the mystery of Jesus' redemptive love shown through his shedding of his Precious Blood that she would preach in towns wherever she went.\\"Maria de Mattias\\", The Adorers of the Blood of Christ Her communities were often very poor, sometimes not even having food in their cupboards, but they were always willing to share whatever they had with the poor among whom they lived. During her lifetime, the Congregation established over 70 communities throughout Europe. De Mattias died in Rome on August 20, 1866Colacino, C.PP.S., John A., \\"At the Heart of the Christian Life: The Charism of Gaspar del Bufalo as the Basis for a Lay Spirituality\\", 1993 and was buried in Rome‚Äôs Campo Verano Cemetery, in a tomb donated by Pope Pius IX. Veneration On 28 June 1896, the required waiting period after De Mattias's death at that time, the process for her canonization was begun at the request of Mother Caterina Pavoni, A.S.C., her successor as Superior General of the Congregation then. She was beatified October 1, 1950 by Pope Pius XII, at which time her remains were transferred to the Chapel of the Precious Blood at the Congregation's General Motherhouse in Rome. She was canonized on May 18, 2003 by Pope John Paul II, with her feast day set as 20 August, the anniversary of her death. Legacy Today the almost 2,000 Sisters of the Congregation continue the work of their foundress around the world. In addition to Italy, communities are also established in Bolivia, Brazil, China, Guatemala, Liberia, South Korea the United States, and Vietnam.

In 1552 the forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Kara Ahmed Pasha laid siege to the Castle of Eger, located in the northern part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but the defenders led by Istv√°n Dob√≥ repelled the attacks and defended the castle. The siege has become an emblem of national defense and patriotic heroism in Hungary. Background Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent commenced his expansion of the empire in 1520 after the reign of Selim I. He began assaults against Hungarian- and Austrian- influenced territories, invading Hungarian soil in 1526. The Hungarian army was crushed at the Battle of Moh√°cs and the way was paved for an attack on the Danube Basin. The battle also brought about the death of the King of Hungary and Bohemia, Louis II, leading to a disputed claim for the throne. Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I succeeded to the Bohemian throne but was challenged to the Hungarian throne by the pretender John Z√°polya, whose claim was backed by nobles and the Sultan. The power struggle continued beyond John's death in 1540 when his son John II Sigismund Z√°polya succeeded to the throne. It was not resolved until he renounced the throne in 1570, when he was succeeded by Maximilian I. The Ottomans met resistance during the Siege of G√ºns (K≈ëszeg) in 1532, where a force of 800 men under Nikola Juri≈°iƒá managed to hold back the Ottoman armies. However, this only delayed their campaign by 25 days, and they continued to close in on Buda, finally occupying the capital in 1541. Buda became the seat of Ottoman rule in the area, with the Ottoman-supported John II governing the occupied territories. The loss of Christian forts at Temesv√°r and Szolnok in 1552 were blamed on mercenary soldiers within the Hungarian ranks. When the Turks turned their attention to the northern Hungarian town of Eger in the same year, few expected the defenders to put up much resistance, particularly as the two great armies of the Ottoman lords Ahmed and Ali, which had crushed all opposition previously, united before Eger. Eger was an important stronghold and key to the defense of the remainder of Hungarian soil. North of Eger lay the poorly reinforced city of Kassa (present-day Ko≈°ice), the center of an important region of mines and associated mints, which provided the Hungarian kingdom with large amounts of quality silver and gold coinage. Besides allowing a takeover of that revenue source, the fall of Eger would also enable the Ottoman Empire to secure an alternate logistic and troop route for further westward military expansion, possibly allowing the Turks to lay sieges to Vienna more frequently. Castle The Castle of Eger is located east of the town on a hillside. Its actual location was not ideal from a military point of view--it overlooks only the southern and western parts of the walled town--but it had the advantage over the Ottoman forces as it provided excellent locations for gun positions. The castle comprised an inner and outer fortress with a gate tower to the southeast and six bastions on the walls: the Earth Bastion and Prison Bastion to the northwest, S√°ndor Bastion on the north wall, Bolyky Bastion on the northeast corner, Bebek Bastion on the eastern corner of the outer fortress, and the Dob√≥ Bastion on the western wall. The Varkoch gate sat on the southern wall of the inner fortress, while a further bastion, Church Bastion, lay at the center of the wall separating the two parts of the fortress. The fortress of Eger was built on the ruins of an earlier stone fort, which replaced an ancient earthen encampment, possibly erected by the Huns. This made Eger's foundations stronger than usual and greatly hindered the work of Ottoman miners. As was usual during sieges at that time, both the attackers and the defenders tried to dig tunnels under the walls and plant gunpowder charges to either open gaps into the fortress or destroy the attacker's trenches. None of these attempts were successful during the siege of Eger. Siege Old Hungarian data and G√°rdonyi's estimate of the size of the Ottoman Army amount to 150-200,000 men. In reality, the Ottoman army numbered 35-40,000 men from the Rumelian army (and an Anatolian contingent) and the troops of Ahmed Pasha from Buda.Magyarorsz√°g hadt√∂rt√©nete, Zr√≠nyi katonai kiad√≥, Budapest 1985. editor.: Liptai Ervin The Ottomans had 16 zarbuzans (very large siege cannons) as well as 150 medium and smaller pieces of artillery and 2000 camels, which proved to be highly useful in the collection and transportation of wood to the site used for the construction of temporary siege platforms. The defenders had six large and about a dozen smaller cannons and about 300 trench guns with ample supplies of ammunition. Despite the difference in troop numbers, Eger's strong walls and the high morale of its defenders allowed the fortress to withstand five major assaults and continuous cannon fire (excluding the ones stuck in the walls of the stronghold, almost 12,000 cannonballs landed inside the fortress before the siege ended). The fortress was defended by 2,100-2,300 people, a mixture of professional soldiers, peasants, and a few dozen women. The defenders were commanded by Istv√°n Dob√≥ and his deputy Istv√°n Mekcsey, who had assumed command in 1549. Among the approximately 1,530 combat-ready personnel there were only a handful of foreign mercenaries: Dob√≥ had hired six cannonmasters from Germany in order to make the most efficient use of Eger's artillery. Another noted officer, famous in Hungarian literature and folklore, was Gergely Bornemissza. He commanded a detachment of 250 Hungarian infantry; however, it was his skill with explosives that was to make this young officer's name. During the siege Bornemissza devised primitive but lethal grenades and powderkeg-sized bombs to use against the attackers as well as a water-mill wheel packed with gunpowder which he rolled into the Ottoman ranks. His secret lay in the gunpowder not simply exploding but sparking even more fire. He loaded these weapons with oil, sulfur, and flint in order to shower the enemy with burning missiles. The Ottomans had expected an easy victory, but the bravery of the castle's defenders, as well as Dob√≥'s inspired leadership, resulted in their repelling repeated Ottoman assaults. Even after the storage tower containing 24 metric tons of black gunpowder exploded and caused extensive structural damage, the invaders still could not find a way into the castle compound. After 39 days of bloody, brutal, and intense fighting the Ottoman Army withdrew, beaten and humiliated. The defenders' losses amounted to about one-third of their ranks, including those killed and permanently maimed in combat. Dob√≥ lost both of his squires. According to modern historical research, several external factors contributed to the defenders' success. There was significant in-fighting between the two Ottoman leaders, Pasha Ali and Pasha Ahmed. Ahmed was the senior and contributed twice as many troops to the united army, but Ali showed more strategic talent and proved his skill in artillery, badly damaging the castle walls with his battery of just four large siege guns. During the siege the Ottoman army ran out of gunpowder and cannonballs (which were carved out of marble) at least twice, limiting Ahmed's use of heavy artillery for a week or more. The end of autumn arrived earlier than usual with heavy rain and freezing nighttime temperatures. Reduced rice rations and allegations of corruption among the officers caused discontent among the Ottoman troops. Despite the failure at Eger, the Ottomans had no reason to lament the campaign of 1552, for they had taken Veszpr√©m, Temesv√°r, Szolnok, and Lippa, as well as some 25 Hungarian strongholds.The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571, Kenneth Meyer Setton, page 585, 1984 After the victory Dob√≥ and his officers resigned, in order to protest King Ferdinand's refusal to contribute any material help to the defense. Gergely Bornemissza was appointed to take over command of the fortress. He was later ambushed, captured, and hanged by the Ottomans. The fortress of Eger remained defiant of Ottoman attacks until 1596 when 7,000 defenders, mostly foreign mercenaries, capitulated to Ottoman forces personally commanded by the Sultan, Mehmed III. The town remained in Ottoman hands for 91 years. Eger has become an emblem of national defense, a symbol of patriotic heroism and the superiority of a national army over an unmotivated foreign mercenary force. In art and literature Earliest records of the siege were recorded by the chronicler Sebesty√©n Tin√≥di Lantos in 1554 who wrote musical verses of the exploits of the people of Eger. It was not until the 19th century that the siege was seized upon by Hungarian writers as the basis of fictional accounts. The first was the poem Eger by Mih√°ly V√∂r√∂smarty in 1827. The most famous account was by author G√©za G√°rdonyi who wrote his popular 1899 historical novel Egri csillagok about the events of this period. It chronicles the events leading up to and including the siege and tells the tale of Gergely Bornemissza, as well as Captain Dob√≥, and his co-commander Istv√°n Mekcsey. During the 1960s the novel was adapted into a feature-length film, which is still regularly shown on Hungarian television. Bertalan Sz√©kely's painting Az Egri N≈ëk (Women of Eger) depicts the defense of the fortress, especially by the womenfolk, and hangs in the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest.

It is shaped like an isosceles triangle with each side approximately in length, and with one side directly adjacent to the Kremlin Wall parallel to Red Square. The building has three floors and is painted in the same yellow color as many other administrative buildings within the Moscow Kremlin. The triangular structure has an inner courtyard, and is divided by hallways into a central pentahedral portion and two side trihedral portions. In the middle of the main fa√ßade is an arched passage fashioned like a triumphal arch leading to the inner yard. Inside is Rotunda Hall (diameter , internal height), once called The Pantheon of Russia.

History Kremlin Senate (top floor, roof, and flag) at night seen from Red Square. The Governing Senate was an institution created by Tsar Peter the Great in 1711. It had six departments, four of which were in St Petersburg and two of which were in Moscow. Empress Catherine the Great had been a frequent guest in Moscow at the time when the city, neglected by past monarchs, did not have enough state offices. She ordered the construction of a building to house the Moscow branches of the Governing Senate, namely the national judiciary administration and the seat of elected administration for the Moscow region. The new building was designed by Matvey Kazakov who had participated in the design of the Moscow Arsenal, and construction was started in 1776 by Karl Blank on a large triangular property in the north-east of the Moscow Kremlin, following a 1775 draft by Kazakov.Russian: Original drawings by Kazakov The site once housed the Trubetskoy family palace and at least three churches.Russian: –ò–ª—å–∏–Ω –ú., –ú–æ–∏—Å–µ–µ–≤–∞ –¢., \\"–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ –∏ –ü–æ–¥–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—å–µ\\", –ú., 1979 In 1779 Blank was demoted, and Kazakov took the lead. He envisaged Governing Senate as a ‚ÄúTemple of Law‚Äù, and designed the structure in a Neoclassical style characterized by symmetry and rigour. The building was completed in 1787, with interior work continuing to 1790. Kazakov's building cost 759,000 roubles. According to Ivan Kondratiev, Catherine was so impressed by the building that she gave Kazakov her gloves, saying \\"I'll pay your bills later, for now - this is a token for your wife\\".

Stalin maintained a small service apartment within the Kremlin Senate, although he chose not to live within the Senate building as his main residence.

(2001). The Haunted Smile: The Story of Jewish Comedians in America, PublicAffairs, a member of the Perseus Books Group. (pbk) April 27, 1911 ‚Äì February 14, 1971) was an American comedian who worked primarily during the 1950s and 1960s. She was known for her foul mouthed, bawdy, irreverent humor. Comedy career Annabelle Salzman, born in 1911, was the ninth child of a Manhattan merchant and, at a very early age, started performing at Borscht belt hotels and small nightclubs. Her first husband was Peter Barth, whose surname she retained when they divorced. In 1950, she moved to Miami Beach, where she married executive D. Thorne in 1954. Belle worked small clubs throughout the area, occasionally travelling to New York and Chicago to perform. In 1953, Barth was arrested and fined 25 dollars for her act; several other cases against her were thrown out of court, including one lawsuit for 1.6 million dollars, brought by two schoolteachers who claimed that Barth's act had corrupted them morally and harmed their health. In spite of these charges, Barth did not modify her act. While living in Miami Beach, she opened Belle Barth's Pub in the Coronet Hotel on 21st Street and Collins Avenue. During the 1960s, she performed often in New York and Las Vegas. In 1960 her talents were discovered by Stanley Borden who broke ground by signing her to his After Hours record label. Her 1960 single, If I Embarrass You Tell Your Friends, was the number one record of the year in Quebec. In 1961, she played both the Roundtable club in New York (where she recorded her second album) and a midnight show at Carnegie Hall on November 25, 1961. In Las Vegas, she played at the Thunderbird, then Caesar's Palace in Nero's Lounge. She returned to Miami Beach to play at venues including Harry's American Showroom at the Eden Roc, the Red Room at the Saxony, the Hotel Plaza in Joe's Lounge for Lovers, and Sans Souci lounge. She was usually accompanied by Margie Sherwin on piano. Personal life Barth was married five times; she and her last husband George B. Martin married twice, either side of a month-long divorce through March 1966. She had no children, but her family included many siblings, nieces and nephews. Death Barth became ill in Las Vegas in May 1970, after her final performance in Miami Beach, at Joe's Lounge at the Hotel Plaza, during March 1970. She performed at the Flamingo once more in September 1970. She died at 10 p.m. on February 14, 1971, aged 59, at her Miami Beach home. Posthumous In 2000, Sophie, Totie & Belle: a fictional meeting of Sophie Tucker, Totie Fields and Belle Barth, written by Joanne Koch and Sarah Blacher Cohen, with some original music by Mark Elliott, lyrics by Mark Elliott and Joanne Koch, appeared for a limited engagement off Broadway at Theatre Four. The show had numerous productions before and after 2000. An April 28, 1996 review in The New York Times by Alvin Klein of the Forum Theatre ‚ÄìQueens Theatre in the Park New York and New Jersey production singled out the Belle Barth section of the show as outstanding: > ‚ÄúIf Belle ‚Äî 'Miami's answer to Lenny Bruce' ‚Äî is the star of this occasion, > blame her defiantly funny, audience winning material. And blame Vicky > Tripodo [as Belle] who is having the smash hit of her career.‚Äù In 2007, Barth was featured in the Off-Broadway production, The J.A.P.

He is well known for his numerous reviews of dance performances in The New York Times and Dance Magazine as well as for his scholarly studies in dance history and for eleven volumes of poetry. Early life and education Jack Warren Anderson was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where his father, George, was a motion picture projectionist at a downtown movie theater and his mother, Eleanore, was a hospital administrator. As a youth, Jack took piano lessons and acted in little theater groups before leaving home to go to college. At Northwestern University he earned a bachelor's degree with a major in theater and minors in English literature and philosophy, and at Indiana University he earned a master's degree in creative writing.\\"Anderson, Jack,' in Who's Who in America (New Providence, N.J.: Marquis Who's Who, 2014). Also available via Marquis Biographies Online. He pursued further graduate study at the University of California at Berkeley but abandoned it after a year when he got his first job with a newspaper. Journalism In 1959, Anderson joined the staff of the Oakland Tribune, starting as a copy boy but becoming the assistant drama critic the next year. He also began writing dance criticism for the English monthly Ballet Today and contributing to Dance Magazine, the leading dance periodical in America. In 1964 Anderson moved to New York and joined the editorial staff of Dance Magazine, where he worked until 1970. After leaving his staff position he continued to contribute critical reviews of dance performances until 1978, when he became one of the three dance critics of The New York Times, along with Anna Kisselgoff and Jennifer Dunning. He remained in this prestigious post for many years, until 2005. He has since continued his affiliation with the Times, preparing listings and writing obituaries of notable figures in the dance world. Since 2007 Anderson has also reviewed dance for www.nytheatre-wire.com. In 1970‚Äì71, while living in London with his partner, George Dorris, he served as the deputy dance critic to Oleg Kerensky (1930‚àí1993) for the Daily Mail and occasionally appeared on the BBC radio show Kaleidoscope, talking about dance, and in 1972 he became the New York correspondent for The Dancing Times of London. In acknowledgment of his expertise, he was asked to serve on the dance panel of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1975 to 1978. Dance history Largely self-taught as a dance historian, at a time when there were no established programs in dance history, Anderson began writing and teaching dance history during the 1970s. In 1977 he and George Dorris became the founding co-editors of the scholarly journal Dance Chronicle: Studies in Dance and the Related Arts.\\"Anderson, Jack\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance, edited by Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell (Oxford University Press, 2000). Together, they made it one of the leading periodicals of dance history, with high standards of scholarship. After many successful years, they passed it on to younger editors in 2007. Widely recognized as an effective teacher and an entertaining lecturer, Anderson was invited to teach dance history and criticism at the American Dance Festival, the University of Adelaide (Australia), the North Carolina School of the Arts, the University of Minnesota, the College of St. Catherine (St. Paul, Minnesota), the New School for Social Research, Herbert L. Lehman College (New York City), and the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. In 2011 he was named to the Brackett Distinguished Visiting Artist Chair at the University of Oklahoma and was invited to give the commencement address at the college division of the New World School of the Arts in Miami. From the 1970s through the 1990s, Anderson undertook various research projects in dance history and eventually produced seven books on various subjects: * Dance. New York: Newsweek Books, 1974. * The Nutcracker. London: Bison Books, 1979. * The One and Only: The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1981. * Ballet & Modern Dance: A Concise History (1983). 2d ed. Pennington, N.J.: Princeton Book Company, 1995. Third edition, 2018. * The American Dance Festival. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1987. * Choreography Observed. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1987. * Art without Boundaries: The World of Modern Dance. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1997. His comprehensive and detailed account of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, which flourished in the United States from 1938 until the early 1960s, won the 1981 Jos√© de la Torre Bueno Prize for the best English-language writing in dance history, and his concise history of ballet and modern dance, published in 1986, was so popular with general readers and as a textbook for students that a second edition was issued in 1992. Poetry Throughout his adult life, Anderson has been drawn to poetic expression. In 1969 he published the first two of his ten books of poetry. His poems have also appeared in many literary magazines and anthologies, and one of his prose poems provided the title for the anthology The Party Train (Minneapolis: New Rivers Press, 1995). He has been a visiting writer at the College of DuPage in Illinois, a poet-in- residence at the University of Kansas, and reader of his poems at various colleges and cultural centers in the United States, Canada, England, and Australia. Anderson's published collections of poems are as follows: * The Hurricane Lamp. Trumansburg, N.Y.: New/Books, 1969. * The Invention of New Jersey. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1969. * City Joys. New York: Release Press, 1975. * Selected Poems. New York: Release Press, 1975. * Toward the Liberation of the Left Hand. Pittsburgh. University of Pittsburgh Press, 1977. * The Dust Dancers. Kansas City: Book Mark Press, 1978. * The Clouds of That Country. Brooklyn: Hanging Loose Press, 1982. * Field Trips on the Rapid Transit.

Brooklyn: Hanging Loose Press, 2009. * Backyards of the Universe. Brooklyn: Hanging Loose Press, 2017. In recognition of the excellence of his work, Anderson received both a National Endowment for the Arts creative writing fellowship and a National Endowment literary award.\\"Anderson, Jack,' in Who's Who in America (2014). He has also enjoyed the approval and recognition of fellow poets. Morton Marcus (1936‚Äì2009), for one, offered the following encomium: \\"Jack Anderson's prodigious imagination creates alternate realities as easily as if they were prefabricated worlds, but so close to our own are they in every wickedly funny and poignant detail that we soon realize we've not been looking out a window but at a mirror. . . . His pictures of the life we lead are satiric gems, yet so consummate an artist is he that at each thrust of his sardonic wit the reader can do nothing but laugh uproariously and demand more.\\"\\"Morton Marcus with Jack Anderson,\\" sound recording of an episode of The Poetry Show, recorded on 22 November 1998 and broadcast by KUSP in Santa Cruz, California. Anderson reads from his book Traffic and is interviewed by Marcus. Personal life Jack Anderson and George Dorris, a dance scholar and retired professor of English, have been life partners for many years. Having known each other slightly at Northwestern University, they met again in 1965 on the subway platform at Lincoln Center after a New York City Ballet performance. Together, they have traveled widely and become friends with dance writers and scholars in many countries around the world. They were married in Toronto in 2006.Wedding announcements, The New York Times (25 July 2006).

Alligator shears are generally set up as stand-alone shears; however, there are types for excavators. The jaw size can range from long. They are generally used to cut ferrous members, such as rebar, pipe, angle iron, or I-beams... Operation Older alligator shears were powered by a flywheel. These shears ran continuously, which posed a safety hazard. Now alligator shears are hydraulically actuated. When actuated, the piston arm extends and slowly closes the upper jaw of the alligator shear, which passes alongside the bed or lower jaw of the shear to perform the cut. Uses Alligator shears are used for cutting long metal stock or scrap, generally where accuracy is not an important consideration, and the size or shape of the material makes other cutting or shearing options (such as a cutting torch) impractical. Alligator shears are often used in conjunction with large metal shredders in the metal recycling industry, to 'clean' or prepare scrap for shredding by removing unwanted fittings and other parts the shredder will not accept. Safety The safety requirements for other powered metalworking shears are contained in ANSI B11.4, but alligator shears are specifically exempted from that standard. Federal OSHA and various state OSHA programs have requirements for guarding alligator shears, and newly manufactured alligator shears are provided with guards that adjust to the size of the stock or scrap being cut. The purpose of this guard, however, is to prevent pieces of metal from being ejected during cutting. Such a guard also prevents inadvertent exposure of the operator's hands, but does not conform to more stringent 'point of operation' guarding requirements. In an interpretive letter dated June 24, 1981, Federal OSHA discussed the guarding dilemma presented by the alligator shear. > In instances where the shear is exclusively used for routine cuts on > standardized stock, safeguarding of the point of operation is definable. In > other instances, the operator is safeguarded from exposure to the point of > operation by the physical size and configuration of the material being cut. These practical considerations for guarding are not exclusive to alligator shears. A much more common type of equipment, the press brake, also requires point of operation guarding when used with standardized stock, but not with large-dimension stock.

In 1984, the Shariatpur District was formed and named after him. Early life Shariatullah is generally acknowledged to have been born into a Bengali Muslim family of Taluqdars in Char Shamail, a village in present-day Shibchar, Madaripur. The exact date or time of his birth and the name of his mother has not been mentioned by any peer-reviewed historical text, but some have estimated it to be circa 1781 CE. Coming from a family with no high educational background, his father was Abd al-Jalil Taluqdar, a landowner who had farming as his primary source of income. At around eight years old, Shariatullah lost his father and was then taken care of by his uncle, Azim ad-Din, who nurtured him in a very loving manner and made Shariatullah's youth \\"carefree\\" with little concern for discipline. However, when he reached the age of twelve, Shariatullah ran away to Calcutta supposedly due to being reprimanded by his uncle on a certain occasion. There, he met a Quran teacher known as Maulana Basharat Ali who subsequently enrolled Shariatullah into his classes. Ali had a crucial impact on the direction of Shariatullah's life, encouraging him to study the Arabic and Persian languages, something that would later allow him to respectively develop a comprehensive understanding of Islamic texts and master the lingua franca of the subcontinent. Shariatullah reached proficieny in these two languages in two years. Following this, Shariatullah then headed north to Murshidabad to meet with his uncle, Ashiq Miyan, who was working in the district as a court official. Shariatullah continued to enhance his proficiency in the two languages during the twelve months he spent with his uncle and aunt. Upon the decision of his uncle and aunt, they set off to visit their ancestral village in Shamail which Shariatullah had not visited since he ran away at the age of twelve. During the journey, a vigorous storm broke down the small sailboat resulting in the martyrdom of Shariatullah's uncle and aunt. Shariatullah was so disturbed by this calamity that he headed back to Calcutta returning to his teacher, Basharat Ali. Migration to Arabia By the time Shariatullah returned to his teacher Basharat Ali in Calcutta, Ali had become so concerned by the British colonial rule that he had made the decision to emigrate to Arabia, home to Makkah and Madinah - the two most holiest sites in Islam. Shariatullah also expressed his strong desire of accompanying him, and was given permission by Ali to join the journey to Arabia in 1799. Shariatullah's first stay in Makkah lasted until 1818 and significantly enhanced his familiarity with Islam and impassioned him even more to enhance his knowledge and understanding on the religion. The time he spent in Arabia is generally divided into three distinct phases. During the first two years, Shariatullah stayed in the home of Mawlana Murad, a Bengali Muslim migrant who permanently resided in Makkah. Shariatullah studied Arabic literature and fiqh during his time with Murad. The second phase of his stay was the most notable and spanned over a 14 year time period in which Shariatullah studied under a prominent Hanafi jurist known as Tahir al-Sumbal Makki where he was introduced to tasawwuf and the Qadiriyya. In the third phase, Shariatullah sought permission from Makki to go and study Islamic philosophy at Al-Azhar University in Islamic Cairo. It is reported that permission was ultimately granted with reluctance, possibly due to a fear of rationalism. It has not been confirmed whether Shariatullah officially enrolled in any courses at the university though he is said to have spent long hours at the university's library. Return to Bengal and the Faraizi Movement According to James Wise and Hidayet Hosain, Shariatullah came back to Bengal from Arabia as a skilled scholar of Islam and Arabic. Upon his return, he had a long beard and wore a turban at all times, something indicative of his strong commitment to all authentic teachings of Islam. When he first visited his uncle Azim al-Din's house in Shamail, no one was able to identify him for his change in appearance. Soon after, his uncle died and reportedly requested him to take care of the family as he had no male heir. Shariatullah was unable to attend his uncle's funeral due to disagreements he had with the local villagers on the manner in which the Islamic funeral had to be conducted. On another occasion, Shariatullah made the call to prayer for Maghrib, to which no one showed up for. He became concerned after finding that many Muslims were indulging in superstitious and Hindu-influenced practices which he viewed as un-Islamic. Thereafter, he began propagating Islam to the Muslim community of Bengal and India. These series of events encouraged him to play his role in guiding the local Muslim population to what he believed to be the pure Islam. This struggle, founded in 1818, came to be known as the Faraizi Movement. Surprisingly, Shariatullah faced a lot of opposition from the Muslim elites in Bengal who also tried to entrap him into legal matters. Following the initial failure of his propagatory activities, Shariatullah decided to return to Makkah. It is believed that this trip took place somewhere between 1818 and 1820. Shariatullah believed that his efforts of purifying Islam in Bengal had met failure because he had not formally requested permission from his teacher Tahir al-Sumbal Makki for moving ahead with this step in his life. This is clearly indicative of the impact his teachers had on his life, and the high degree of respect he had for them. It is also reported but has never been confirmed that a turning point in his struggles for purifying Islam was a dream that he had of Prophet Muhammad during this stay. According to the unconfirmed accounts, Shariatullah was encouraged in the dream to purify Islam in his homeland. As a result, he returned to Bengal in circa 1821 with much more enthusiasm and passion than during his prior visit. Though founded in 1818, the Faraizi Movement became popular and well-known in Bengal, following his second attempt in 1821. Durr-i-Muhammad describes the impact of Faraizi movement in the words ‚ÄúAll these bidat were then abolished and the sun of Islam rose high in the sky‚Äù. Hunter takes a similar stand by saying ‚ÄúHaving arrived there Haji Shariatullah propagated (true) religion throughout Bengal‚Äù. An example of one tradition would be the planting of a banana tree when a woman menstruates for the first time. Shariatullah wanted the Muslims to focus on the teachings of the Quran in an orthodox manner, and he effectively devoted the later portion of his life towards his movement. The beliefs of Haji Shariatullah had a significant overlap with those of Wahhabism and continue to be very popular to date. Teachings Shariatullah's Faraizi movement focused on reforming the priorities of Bengali Muslims based on the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence. It called for Muslims to recognise and partake in their compulsory duties (fard); one example being the five daily prayers. He instructed his followers to assimilate every religious duty required by the Quran and Sunnah. He called for observance of the five pillars, the complete acceptance and observance of tawhid and prohibited all digressions from the original doctrines of Islam such as shirk (polytheism) and bid ªah (innovation). The movement also fought for the rights of Muslims under the colonial rule; deeming British domination as detrimental to the religious life of Muslims. It branched on to becoming not just a religious but also a socio-economic issue, when some of the elites, mainly Muslim and Hindu zamindars, attempted to entrap Shariatullah into legal matters. This was upon their disagreement with the ways he was propagating his beliefs, especially regarding his disagreement to paying non-Islamic taxes and the slaughtering of cows. =Reception= The Faraizi Movement was very popular in its time among the general population and its remnants remain very popular to date. It began to circulate with astonishing speed from Madaripur to the districts of Dacca, Faridpur, Backergunge, Mymensingh and Comilla. Some wealthy Bengalis on the other hand, particularly the landlords of Dhaka, hence, reacted sharply against him and this caused a riot in Noyabari, Dacca. The reaction of these landlords, both Muslim and Hindu, as well as European indigo planters, caused the movement to become a socio-economic issue. Gradually, incidents caused by the Faraizi movement could be witnessed in various parts of Bengal. The outraged landlords built up a propaganda campaign with the British officials, incriminating the Faraizis with mutinous mood. In 1837, these Hindu landlords accused Shariatullah of attempting to build up a monarchy of his own, similar in lines to Titumir. They also brought several lawsuits against the Faraizis, in which they benefitted dynamic cooperation of the European indigo planters. Shariatullah was placed under the detention of the police in more than one instance, for purportedly inciting agrarian turbulences in Faridpur.  Death and legacy  ‚ÄúHaji Shariatullah died at his native village Shamail in 1840 at the age of 59‚Äù and was buried in the backyard of his home. His grave was washed away in a flooding of his home, but his tomb inscription has been preserved by the Asiatic Society of Pakistan. After his death, the Faraizi Movement was led by Dudu Miyan, Haji Shariatullah's only son and child. Shariatullah remains one of the most celebrated and prominent Muslim reformers to date, especially amongst the category of those who pertain to the history of Islamic leaders in the Indian sub-continent. He is very well known and acknowledged by Muslim communities of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan with his Faraizi Movement as being the epitome of his legacy and services. Details about Faraizi Movement can be found in common school textbooks as well as in Islamic historical books. After the death of Haji Shariatullah in 1840, leadership of the Faraizi movement passed to his only son, Muhsinuddin Ahmad popularly known as Dudu Miyan. Palong thana of Madaripur, a district in the Dhaka Division of Bangladesh, was named Shariatpur District in honor of Haji Shariatullah. Bangladesh issued a postage stamp commemorating him on 10 March 1993. As of 2005, the Haji Shariatullah Bridge over the Arial Khan River on the Mawa-Bhanga highway in Shibchar is named after him. A biography film was made in Bangladesh titled Haji Shariatullah directed by Hafizuddin and portrayed by Ilias Kanchan.

The mission is based in downtown Toronto and aims to offer practical, emotional, and spiritual support for thousands of people each year. Morris Zeidman, an ordained Presbyterian minister who was born in Czƒôstochowa, Poland, and converted to Christianity from Judaism, founded The Scott Mission with his wife Anne in 1941. It was their belief that the hunger of the soul needed to be addressed as well as the hunger of the physical body. Services Outside The Scott Mission, Toronto, May 17, 2007 The Scott Mission has two locations in Toronto. At 502 Spadina Avenue, the Mission offers hot meals, free bag lunches, overnight shelter for 45-50 men each night, shower and laundry facilities, a food and clothing bank, Bible study groups, and fellowship activities. The Mission opened the O'Connor Family Centre in May 2013, at 1550 O'Connor Drive, designed to serve families in the east end of Toronto. They offer a Christian Childcare Centre, food and clothing bank, youth programs, and a variety of resources for families. The Mission also has a lodge in Collingwood, Ontario, that is used as a retreat centre away from the city. The Lodge is located on on the Blue Mountain overlooking Georgian Bay, and was a gift to the Mission in honour of founder Rev. Morris Zeidman. The group owns a campground in Caledon, Ontario, about a 45-minute drive north of Toronto. In the summer, around 600 children and youth from low-income neighbourhoods attend The Scott Mission's camp. Funding The Mission spends about $8,000,000 per year, including capital projects.

During this period limited services operated using a variety of different buses on route 521. In September 2009, as part of the move to replace London's articulated buses, the O530Gs were replaced by Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaros. Another criticism of articulated buses was the low number of seats, with only 49 per vehicle. A standard rigid Citaro has 44 seats, however the new ones for route 521 have just 21, with room supposedly for up to 76 standers, leading to criticism the new buses were \\"cattle trucks\\" and even more crowded than the buses they replaced.

Although the dish's name is derived from Huancayo, a city in the Peruvian highlands, this dish is from Lima - Per√∫. It has become a staple of everyday and holiday cuisine throughout the country. It is typically served cold as a starter over lettuce leaves and garnished with black olives, white corn kernels and hard boiled egg quarters. The sauce is made of queso fresco (fresh white cheese), vegetable oil, aj√≠ amarillo (yellow Peruvian pepper), evaporated milk and salt mixed in a blender. Some recipes call for garlic, onion and crushed saltines. This sauce is also used in many other Peruvian dishes. In the south of Peru (Cuzco, Puno, Arequipa) it is served with ocopa rather than Huanca√≠na sauce, made from freshly toasted peanuts, fried onions and tomatoes, aj√≠ amarillo, cream or condensed milk, crushed crackers or dried bread, salt, and huacatay (Tagetes minuta). Because it is served cold, Papa a la huanca√≠na is a favorite food of Peruvians to take on picnics and trips.  Origin  The origin of Papa a la huanca√≠na is controversial. On one side, stories exist that point to the area of Lima: * The most well-known story explains that it emerged during the construction of Peru‚Äôs Central Railroad, stretching from Lima to Huancayo. Food for the workers was prepared by Huancan women who boiled potatoes and served them with a cheese, pepper and milk sauce, which would become Papas a la Huancaina. * A more modern story explains that the plate was served at the railway stations between Lima and Huancayo, sold to passengers as a light food consisting of potatoes bathed in a delicious cheese and pepper sauce. From that came the name ‚Äúpotatoes that you eat in route to Hauncayo‚Äù which would later be changed to Papa a la Huancaina. While the cheese and the potato are produced along the Peruvian sierra, they are also produced along the coast. In fact, the cultivating of the yellow pepper takes place only in coastal zones (4,000-year-old yellow pepper remnants have been found in the archaeological sites of Huaca Prieta and Ancon). In addition, the olives that accompany the preparation, also originate from the coast, and not the city of Huancayo. It should also be mentioned that it does not match the preparation style of typical Huancan food, which often consists of hot foods made with red meat, additionally in the cities along the Peruvian sierra it is uncommon to serve appetizers.

It is located east of the border crossing with Germany along national road DK22. The village lies about 25 kilometres (or 16 miles) northwest of Sulƒôcin and southwest of Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski. The village borders Poland's Uj≈õcie Warty National Park stretching to the north. S≈Ço≈Ñsk had town privileges from 1808 to 1947, consequence of a small population size. During the Second World War, S≈Ço≈Ñsk (Sonnenburg) was the site of a Nazi concentration camp, now a museum. History =Middle Ages= S≈Ço≈Ñsk castle before destruction Present-day S≈Ço≈Ñsk was founded within the historic Lubusz Land, which formed part of the Kingdom of Poland since the establishment of the state in the 10th century until the mid-13th century, when it was acquired by the German Margraviate of Brandenburg. Most Slavic Polish inhabitants of the region were gradually Germanicized in the centuries that followed. Then known as Sonnenburg, the settlement first appears in documents in 1295. The Knights Templar held lands and buildings in the town. From 1312, the Margrave of Brandenburg and the Bishop of Lebus were joint overlords of Sonnenburg. Henning and Arnold von Uechtenhagen later received Sonnenberg as a fief and built the first castle there in 1341. From 1373 to 1415 it was part of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown. From the 15th century, the town maintained a close connection with the Order of Saint John (the Knights Hospitaller), who had purchased it from Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg. The castle became the seat of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg of the Order, which greatly enlarged the town, building a new church (between 1474 and 1522), a new castle (between 1545 and 1564), and a model hospital (in the 19th century). =Modern era= Victims of the Sonnenburg concentration camp found in 1945 by the Soviets From the 18th century the town formed part of Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it also formed part of Germany. A severe prison was built in the town in 1832. It held such Polish fighters for independence as Karol Libelt and Bronis≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski (the son of General Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski). In 1933, German authorities converted the prison into the Sonnenburg concentration camp, in which such anti-Nazi activists as Carl von Ossietzky and Hans Litten were held.Jean-Michel Palmier, Weimar in exile: the antifascist emigration in Europe and America, Verso, 2006 , p. 41. Google Books During World War II, Polish defenders of the Pozna≈Ñ citadel were held in the prison after capture during the invasion of Poland in 1939, and in 1944 some of the former fighters in the Warsaw Uprising were incarcerated there. During the war also Frenchmen, Luxembourgers, Dutchmen, Danes, Norwegians, Belgians, Czechs, Yugoslavs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Austrians, the Swiss, Estonians, Russians and Spaniards were held in the camp. Before withdrawal, during the night of 30‚Äì31 January 1945, the SS executed 819 political prisoners from many European countries at Sonnenburg.History of S≈Ço≈ÑskBiuletyn G≈Ç√≥wnej Komisji Badania Zbrodni Przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu Instytutu Pamiƒôci Narodowej, Wrasaw, 1994, p. 273 Google Books =After World War II= Gmina office Sonnenburg (S≈Ço≈Ñsk) was captured by the Soviet Red Army in the spring of 1945 as the Second World War in Europe drew to a close. During the Potsdam Conference held from 17 July to 2 August 1945 Sonnenburg along with the rest of the recovered territories was awarded to postwar Poland, and renamed legally as S≈Ço≈Ñsk. Most of the German inhabitants fled ahead of the front or were expelled soon thereafter, as occurred throughout the former eastern territories of Nazi Germany. The town was repopulated with the Poles expelled by the Soviet Union from the formerly Polish territories of Kresy Wschodnie, and by settlers from central Poland. In 1947 S≈Ço≈Ñsk lost its town rights and was given the status of a village due to small population size. A museum dedicated to the victims of the Nazi German concentration camp was founded in 1974.

The dish originated as part of the chifa tradition, the Chinese cuisine of Peru, though its popularity has made it part of the mainstream culture. Dish The dish is normally prepared by marinating sirloin strips in vinegar, soy sauce and spices, and stir frying these with red onions, parsley, tomatoes, and possibly other ingredients. The use of both potatoes (which originated in Peru) and rice (which originated in Asia) as starches are typical of the cultural blending that the dish represents. In his 2013 article in the Huffington Post UK, British-Peruvian chef Martin Morales called lomo saltado \\"one of Peru's most loved dishes\\" and that this dish \\"shows the rich fusion of old and new worlds. This juicy mixture of beef, onions, tomatoes, aji Amarillo paste and soy sauce sauteed in a large pan (or wok) is one of the many contributions Chinese immigration brought to Peru.\\" He explains, \\"Lomo Saltado is sometimes known as a Criollo dish but more known as a Peruvian- Chinese dish; a favourite Chifa dish. These are its true roots\\". According to a 2011 article that was published in the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio, the book \\"Diccionario de la Gastronom√≠a Peruana Tradicional\\" published in 2009 by Sergio Zapata Acha, includes an old description for lomo saltado, which fails to mention its Asian influence. Although this doesn't deny the dish's widely accepted Chinese-Peruvian roots, the article's author then ponders possible relations to similar dishes like lomo de vaca and lomo a la chorrillana. The word saltado refers to stir fry (salteado in other Spanish-speaking countries, from the french saut√©e, which means to \\"jump\\"), a widely recognized Chinese cooking technique. Hence, saltado dishes are commonly known in Peru to have a Chinese cuisine influence. The same 2011 newspaper article mentions that having a Chinese cook (or servant) was considered a luxury at the time and that years later after completing their indenture contracts, many Chinese Peruvians opened restaurants that became known as Chifa by 1921. A census of Lima in 1613 show the presence of Chinese (and other Asians) in Peru, mainly servants (and slaves). Later, large numbers of Chinese immigrant workers arrived between 1849 and 1874, to replace African slave laborers, while Peru was in the process of abolishing slavery. So it is not a surprise that a 1903 Peruvian cookbook (\\"Nuevo Manual de Cocina a la Criolla\\") included a short description of lomo saltado. An indication of assimilation of Chinese cooking technique in Peruvian cuisine. The culinary term saltado is unique to Peru, and didn't exist in other Latin countries of that era, nor used in any Spanish cuisine terminology. This old cookbook description of the dish is very short and does not mention soy sauce or other typical Asian ingredients of the dish known today. It also does not mention black pepper, vinegar, or Peruvian chilies. A few critics incorrectly theorized a purely Peruvian origin (without foreign influence) based on this cookbook, which features an assorted variety of regional Peruvian dishes (from Arequipa, Chorrillos, Moquegua, etc.). But this cookbook's list of traditional Peruvian Criollo cuisine includes many dishes with Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Guatemalan and Chilean origins. The 1903 cookbook is not an all-inclusive list of old Peruvian dishes available in the country, and it does not contradict the Chinese-Peruvian roots of lomo saltado. It serves as an example (the opinions of its editor) of a variety of dishes that were commonplace in Peru of that era, regardless of origin. In a 2014 video interview for the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio, noted Peruvian chief Gast√≥n Acurio demonstrates how he makes his version of lomo saltado.

Computer Gaming World, October, 1994. it is a Point Of View (POV) video-based experiment in simulated socializing that takes place in an anonymous city late one night. Players navigate between several locations, and can interact with one or more people in each location to varying effects based on the player's \\"reactions\\" to that person. The main technical innovation of Midnight Stranger is its use of an emotional continuum Mood Bar for interaction with the in-story characters rather than a text interface or an itemized set of options for each interaction. The Mood Bar simulates some of the frustration and uncertainty when dealing with other people in social situations,Rahlmann, Reed. Newmedia Magazine, September, 1994. and provides a more realistic role playing experience.Lowell, Jeremy. Shift, Winter 1995. Gameplay The major technical innovation of the gameOttawa X Press, February 23, 1994, \\"Do You Want To Be A Midnight Stranger?\\". is its user interface which consists of a continuous coloured band called the Mood Bar that appears below the characters when they pause in the ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù for user input. The red, left end of the bar represents a negative response (\\"no\\", \\"I disagree\\", \\"I don‚Äôt like that\\"), the blue central part of the band represents a neutral response (\\"I don‚Äôt know\\", \\"I don‚Äôt care\\", \\"I have no opinion\\"), and the green right end of the bar represents a positive response (\\"yes\\", \\"I agree\\", \\"I like that\\").Jim Gasperini, Wired, December 1994, \\"Virtual Loneliness\\". While the bar is a smooth colour gradient that shows no clear demarcations, giving the illusion of infinite choice, there were usually only three possible pathways from any given bar, with varying percentages of the bar devoted to the choices depending on circumstance. Only one other production has been published using this device (Mode, 1995). Navigation is primarily between still images of street scenes and building fronts. Moving the mouse raised a small \\"GO\\" icon in directions you may progress, bringing up another still image location. Some of these icons appear on entrances to public locations; a movie theatre, restaurants, clubs, etc. Clicking on these takes you to an interior scene including people. Rolling over some of these people raised a \\"TALK\\" icon, indicating that clicking on them will instigate a \\"conversation\\".Gerry Blackwell, The Toronto Star, February 16, 1995, \\"Take a virtual walk on the Wild Side\\". Because of disc size restrictions at the time of creation there was a serious limitation in the amount of video content that could be included on a disc. To accommodate this and still have enough material to constitute a viable product, Green conceived of a technique for embedding small frames of video into full screen still frames, usually the head and shoulders of the speaking character being the only part of the frame that moved.Reed Rahlmann, NewMedia Magazine, September 1994. This approach was both laudedDavid Wade, CD-ROM Today, October 1994. and criticized in published reviews, since it is a clever solutionEden Maxwell, Computer Gaming World, October 1994, \\"Relationships That Pass In The Night\\". yet often creates distracting disjoints between character motion and the framing image.Matt Foley, Axcess Magazine, Vol. II, No. 5. Midnight Stranger has eighteen onscreen performers with varying depths of content. Only three of the characters are involved in a plot that can lead to various \\"endings\\", involving a supernatural object of extraterrestrial origin. In an effort to create a filmic feel, a feature causes that after a given amount of time (about sixty minutes) in game play the \\"relationship\\" with any character will lead to an \\"ending\\" that triggers the credits. If you manage to find the object there are several scenes where an icon appears representing the object. If you click the icon a brief special effect ensues, depending on the circumstance.Drew Carnwath, Campus Canada, November 1994. The overarching concept is that \\"you\\" are a stranger in a late- night city who engages random people in conversation, on the street, in bars, clubs or restaurants. These conversations, dictated by Mood Bar choices, can lead to dead ends or various \\"fulfillments\\", depending on the character. Three of the female characters can lead to short sex encounters with minimal (waist- up) nudity.Ty Burr, Entertainment Weekly, October 14, 1994, \\"Looking for love in all the ROM places\\". The disc was given an \\"adults-only\\" rating mostly because of the extremely strong language, mostly delivered by one character (\\"The Hood\\"). Development In 1992 the Animatics Multimedia Corporation, founded by Alfredo Coppola and Simon Goodwin, was a middle-level computer graphics and multimedia purveyor for Ottawa corporations and Canadian government departments. Through a friendship with Jeff Green they were allowing him to use their graphics hardware to produce animation for his television show \\"Cowboy Who?\\". When Goodwin came up with an idea for a social video-based interactive \\"game\\" they called on Green to help them develop the idea and to write and direct the final product. Using friends, they produced a brief demo and began shopping it to multimedia publishers. After several false starts they finally established a relationship with Gazelle Technologies, a San Diego-based company primarily associated with mail order CD-ROM distribution, and began the production process. Originally Green wrote a complicated multi-layer script that would have called for hundreds of hours of final footage, but when he began the auditions he became fascinated with the extraordinary life stories the (predominantly inexperienced) applicants told him, and he decided on a different direction that would use their life stories in improvised performances. Locations were selected and, in June 1993, Green began the shooting using a Sony Hi-8 handycam, sometimes doing all set preparation and lighting himself. Principal photography was completed in July 1993 and Goodwin began the programming. A beta version was presented at the Macromedia International User's Conference in San Francisco, September 1993, where it won a People's Choice Award, and the first Mac consumer version was released in November of that year. A PC version followed in early 1994. Awards * 1993 -- Macromedia People's Choice Award, San Francisco, Macromedia International User's Conference * 1995 -- Murphy Award for Best Story in an Interactive Multimedia Title, March 1995, Electronic Entertainment Trivia * The product was originally named simply ‚ÄúStranger‚Äù but a copyright search revealed that Marvel Comics held the rights to the name for possible CD-ROM development, so the ‚ÄúMidnight‚Äù was added. * Footage was shot to present potentially erotic encounters designed for a heterosexual woman and a gay man, but space restrictions led the producers to cut them, leaving only material geared for a straight male. Much press criticism was leveled at the product because of this limited orientation. * With exception of a quasi-sci- fi storyline involving an alien artifact, most of the character content was developed by Green in collaboration with the performers, drawing material from their real lives, so that their improvised performances would be as naturalistic as possible. In the case of the Actress this approach led to some controversy. She and Green decided to pursue the recreation of a traumatic assault she had suffered. In order for the player to get to this assault they must first listen to her lengthy emotional description of a previous rape, then repeatedly refuse to leave and then refuse repeated requests to stop. The rape footage was POV, about 20 seconds, with no nudity, and the game immediately after shut down with a message that \\"this is not acceptable conduct, even for a game\\". When a Ryerson feminist was informed about this footage (having never actually played the game) she began a letter-writing campaign demanding that Midnight Stranger be banned as a \\"high-tech rape game\\". The sequence was removed from the principal pressings. * The Homeless Man encountered on the street was played by Lyle Burwell, a Canadian performer and stand-up monologist who used some material from his routine in his character's performance. * The drunk in the parking lot who the Hood convinces you to beat up is played by Midnight Stranger's producer Alfredo Coppola. * In the original production, footage shot but not included in the final disc, the middle (male) dancer in the Dance Club was also accessible, led to a short conversation in a stairwell, and a brief (implicitly heterosexual) erotic encounter. * In the original production, footage shot but not included in the final disc, the Bar Fly in the Rock Club would take you to a gay performance club where you could watch a cabaret show, meet one of the performers, and go home with him for a brief (implicitly homosexual) erotic encounter. * The stand-up comic is played by Rick Kalbars, who is a real comic and writer. The story he tells about having a friend he was responsible for sending to prison who has just been released (the character of the Hood) was based on fact. * Randy Kay both created the music for the production (in the title credits and the dance club) and played the Hood. He is not actually a criminal and has never killed anybody. He also appears in Jeff Green's TV series \\"Cowboy Who?\\" as a surly children's TV host named Mack Yavellian. * The footage was all shot in the downtown area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Several commentators thought it looked like a small town, while others claimed to have recognized locations in San Francisco, Seattle, and Paris. * In the comedy club when you sit down to talk to the Comic at the bar, if you pause before clicking on the Comic you will see a short ad for \\"Kitchen Hammer\\" run on the bar's TV screen. This segment is taken from Green's TV series \\"Cowboy Who?\\". * The alien object is a painted tennis ball. * The Graffiti Artist will take you to his home, which scene was shot in a studio of the Ottawa School of Art. He is supposedly obsessed with the alien object, which he has had dreams about, and where he is sitting is surrounded by circular artworks, most of which were objects and paintings by students that had been found in the studio during set preparation.

Its critical success did lead to an association of Green and Animatics with the Ottawa-based Corel Corporation, which financed an elaborate follow-up CD-ROM (Mode) and associated web-based version (\\"Club Mode\\"). * CD-ROM Magazine (Vol. 5 Issue 1): \\"This is a landmark game: unlike any other computer game, this really does start to feel like real life... this could well be the way first person adventure games will go...\\" * NewMedia Magazine (Sept. 1994, Reed Rahlmann): \\"Midnight Stranger is particularly successful at showing the frustrations of social interaction... There is good replay ability... The many characters are not fleshed out; most play along one emotional note or narrative. And the sexual encounters are for heterosexual men. Still, the design is clever enough to carry anyone along for the ride. The navigation is speedy and the pacing satisfying. This is one weird city!\\" * CDROM World (Oct. 1994, Todd Harris): \\"This adults-only urban drama has all the elements of a kitschy classic: psychos, rude bartenders, and bad production values. An interesting but failed experiment.\\" * CDROM Today (Oct. 1994, David Wade): \\"The problem with Midnight Stranger is the shortfall between the ambitions of its conceptual reach and what finally ends up within its aesthetic grasp... Midnight Stranger deserves good marks for attempting some ingenious solutions to the problems of digital world building.

The creators of MS deserve kudos for dialogue that is extremely funny, intelligent, and, well, REAL... and much credit goes, too, to the actors who bring the characters to life...

It has the flavor of close collaboration with a talented group of actors, and as such gives a sense of what theatre people might do with the interactive medium... At its best the writing neatly ‚Äòsamples‚Äô what would in reality be a lengthy conversation, creating a naturally flowing sense of high point and ellipsis. But the structure's potential has not been fully utilized. The story to which all this cleverness is applied ends up being about as meaningful as an evening spent cruising singles bars. The overall approach is interesting enough, though; the next title using it should be something to look forward to.\\" * Axcess Magazine (Vol.II, No.5, Matt Foley): \\"The best thing about Midnight Stranger is that it is not really a game; there is an interesting story going on behind the scenes, but you can do whatever you want. This disk is like going out on the town with no set plans, only a vague mission to have fun.\\" * Computer Gaming World (Oct.'94, Eden Maxwell, \\"Relationships That Pass In The Night\\"): \\"Mature audiences will find themselves captivated by Midnight Stranger from the opening screen... What distinguishes Stranger is an intelligent script that elevates characters from objects to people you develop feelings for ... Directing the characters, including yourself, in this free form cinema verit√© experiment is exciting and habit forming...\\" * Electronic Entertainment (Mar. 1995, James Daly): \\"Midnight Stranger isn‚Äôt perfect, but if offers an intriguing glimpse of how multimedia games can move beyond glorified cartoons. The game can be gritty, frustrating, and sometimes just plain weird; but it delivers enough intrigue and hidden surprises to keep anyone interested... And the disc never plays the same twice.\\" * Nautilus CD (Feb. 1995, Steve Stein): \\"I cannot recommend this game too highly. If you‚Äôre not offended by the content, pick up a copy. There's nothing like it.\\" * Shift (Winter 1995, Jeremy Lowell): \\"Admittedly, the CD-ROM is sometimes chauvinistic, cheesy and the acting amateurish.

The dish's name is a portmanteau of the Spanish words \\"salchicha\\" (sausage) and \\"papa\\" (potato). Salchipapas typically consist of thinly sliced pan-fried beef sausages and French fries, mixed together with a savory coleslaw on the side. The dish is served with different sauces, such as ketchup and mustard, crema de aceituna (olive sauce), along with aji or chili peppers. Sometimes a fried egg or cheese is added on top; it can also come with tomato and lettuce, and is occasionally garnished with oregano.  History  Salchipapa consumption has expanded beyond Lima, and its recipe adopted by various Latin American cuisines. The salchipapa was invented as a street food in Lima, Peru. Over the years, it expanded to other places in Peru. In Latin America, the dish's popularity has expanded beyond Peruvian cuisine, and is now also typical of Ecuadorian and Bolivian cuisine. The dish is also sold on Argentinian streets and markets. The range of the dish keeps expanding due to the Bolivian immigration in Argentina and Peruvian restaurants in the United States and Chile. There's a variant known as \\"choripapas\\" (made with chorizo instead of sausage). They can also be found in Mexico.

The Queen of Ireland: An Historical Account of Ireland's Devotion to the Blessed Virgin (Dublin: M.H. Gill, 1938).\\"  University life and life as professor  Concannon was educated by the Loreto nuns in Coleraine. In 1897, she studied modern languages at the Royal University of Ireland on a three-year scholarship. She studied abroad during these years as in 1899, she travelled to Germany and studied German in Berlin University accompanied by her friend, Mary Macken. Concannon then travelled to France to study French in Sorbonne. In 1900, Concannon graduated Bachelor of Arts with first class honours and went on to study Master of Arts in 1902 at the Royal University of Ireland. Concannon was fortunate to being one of the first generation of educated women. In 1906, Concannon married Thomas Concannon who she met in 1900, when he arrived home from America. They settled down in County Galway where they shared the same love for the Irish Language and wrote many Irish texts. In Galway, Concannon was a professor at the University of Galway where she taught history, which mainly involved the history of Irish Women. In 1909, Concannon was offered a lectureship at University of College Dublin, in Italian, but the offer was then drawn before she could accept, so she decided to pursue the writing career. Writing career In 1909 she was offered a lecturer position at University College Dublin and after the offer was withdrawn she began her writing career. She produced over twenty books and published a number of works on religion, history of Ireland and Irish women's history. Her works were highly impacted by her political and nationalist views. Her 'analyses of Irish history was based on Catholicism and patriotism'. She was also an advocate of Irish language restoration. Her first writings were love poems to her husband Tom√°s B√°n √ì Conceanainn. These poems were 'simple, sensuous and passionate'. She also produced a number of imaginative historical text for children. She used her married name for her publications and her first book was published in 1914 titled as A Garden of girls, or the famous schoolgirls of former days, it was about 'school life and education of real little girls'. Her next well known piece was the Life of St. Columban in 1915, which was a study about the Irish ancient monastic life and a biography of a sixth-century saint. Two of her books, Daughters of Banba (1922) and St. Patrick (1932), received the Tailteann Medal for Literature, and The Poor Clares in Ireland (1929) won the National University Prize a DLitt higher doctorate degree for historical research. Her most common publication the Women of Ninety Eight was dedicated to all the dead women and all the living ones who have given their loved ones. This book emerged on the ideologies of Catholicism and patriotism \\"praising the devotion of Irish nationalist women while emphasising the centrality of women's spiritual and domestic role in the home to the well-being of the nation\\" As this work was written during the time of the War of Independence, Concannon stressed the importance of women help during the rebellion as \\"they acted as messengers and intelligence officers\\", and in some cases, they fought as any men.  Life in the D√°il  Concannon started her political career in D√°il √âireann, she was in the D√°il from 8 February 1933, after the 1933 general election, until 14 June 1937. She was as a Fianna F√°il TD for the National University of Ireland constituency. Concannon, in 1933, voted 'Yes' along with 81 others for De Valera to become the President of the Executive Council. In 1935, she voted for 'The Control of Imports Orders' Quota 2 and Quota 3 along with 65 other TDs in the first and 60 others in the latter. She voted yes with the majority on every issue posed on 13 February 1935 Concerning the 'Land Purchase (Guarantee Fund) Bill, 1935' which according to Bennet would have negatively impacted the rural middle class of which he was a representative, Bennet accuses Concannon and her fellow Dublin men of not caring about the people of the country \\"If Deputy Kelly, Deputy Donnelly or Deputy Mrs. Concannon were asked to apply a retrospective liability of this character to the citizens of Dublin, would they comply with the request? They know they would not. Because this Bill affects, in the main, the hardworking agriculturists, Deputy Kelly, Deputy Mrs. Concannon and other City Deputies can view it with equanimity.\\"-Bennet Concannon went on to vote that the Dail should disagree with the Seanad propose bill with 71 others Though, she was a TD in the D√°il as a University representative, she voted to annexe University representation in the D√°il, in following with her party's views. Leading to one TD saying \\" I am very much surprised to see such a distinguished scholar and such a great contributor to Irish literature as Deputy Mrs. Concannon voting for the disfranchisement of the University that she has so well and so ably represented. \\"-Mr. J.M. Burke Concannon spoke on behalf of Irish women in the D√°il in 1936. She spoke on how Irish women a fundamental role in Ireland's agricultural economy and so more money should be put towards educating these women. She did not contest the D√°il election of 1937  Life in the Seanad  Concannon was elected in the 1938 general election to the Seanad Eireann for the National University of Ireland constituency. She was a popular figure and was re-elected each election in the Seanad until she died in office in 1952. Concannon was one of the minority voices against the part appointed to women De Valera's constitution. Concannon was a member of the Seaned for 8 years.

Drake often wrote about challenges and achievements in race relations as a result of his extensive research. While studying at University of Chicago, in 1945 Drake co-authored with Horace R. Cayton, Jr. the work Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City, a landmark study of race and urban life. Drake was one of the first African-American faculty members at Roosevelt University in Chicago, at a time when academic opportunities for Black scholars were usually limited to historically black colleges and universities. He continued his research while a professor at Roosevelt for 23 years, before leaving to found the African and African American Studies program at Stanford University.Bond, George C., and St. Clair Drake, \\"A Social Portrait of John Gibbs St. Clair Drake,\\" American Ethnologist, 15(4), 1988, pp. 762‚Äì781. A major element in Drake's career was an interest in Africa and the pan-African movement, which sprang from his dissertation work with immigrants from Africa living in the United Kingdom, and was expanded upon during his later research projects conducted in West Africa. Ultimately he spent years working in the newly independent country of Ghana as an academic and an informal advisor to the national government there, before his return to the United States and his academic career in that country. Early life and education John Gibbs St. Clair Drake was born in Suffolk, Virginia, on January 2, 1911. Later in life, including professionally, he went by his last name only, St. Clair Drake. His father immigrated to the United States from Barbados in the British West Indies, becoming a Baptist minister and an international organizer for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association.\\"Drake, St. Clair.\\" William A. Darity, Jr. (ed.), International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, 2nd edition. Vol. 2. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008, pp. 442‚Äì443. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. October 17, 2013. His father's devout religious faith did not allow for activities like dancing, going to the movies, or using playing cards, all of which were forbidden to Drake in his childhood. Drake's mother, Bessie Lee, was a native of Staunton, Virginia. When Drake was two years old, the family moved to Harrisburg, Virginia, when his father decided it would be best for the family to join the many African Americans who were then moving northward. During his childhood, St. Clair lived in a multi-ethnic neighborhood. He recalled that his understanding of race and prejudice was vague, but at least one of his fights occurred when he was insulted about the color of his skin. Drake attended elementary school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he remained through the 7th grade. He then returned to Virginia to attend high school. He inevitably learned \\"the facts of Southern life\\", and in his first contact with the Negro press, he remarked: \\"It was rather exciting, this learning that one is a Negro and what it means ‚Äì also rather frustrating.\\"\\"St. Clair Drake\\", Biographical Sketch, St. Clair Drake Papers, Roosevelt University Archives, Chicago. At this time, with the encouragement of his teachers, he began to write poetry, generally about nature. That same year, he also edited the school yearbook. He completed high school in three years. In 1927, Drake left Staunton, Virginia, to attend Hampton Institute (now Hampton University). Hampton's appeal, according to Drake, was its offer to allow students to work their way through college. Drake met the cost of his education by working as a waiter and then as a front desk clerk at the Holly Tree Guesthouse. Both of these forms of employment were segregated jobs, intended only for black workers. Drake was almost immediately dissatisfied with the faculty's \\"civilizing mission\\" attitude, which he attributed to the intellectual legacy of Booker T. Washington, and he complained that the Institute's faculty did not include any African Americans among its full professors. Drake and other Hampton students engaged in a strike beginning on October 9, 1927, only a few weeks after Drake arrived on campus.Baber, Willie L. (1999), \\"St. Clair Drake\\", in Ira E. Harrison and Faye V. Harrison (eds), African-American Pioneers in Anthropology, Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, pp. 196‚Äì198. While the list of student demands exceeded sixty specific points, many of them dealt with the need for more black teachers, higher academic standards, the dismissal of racist and unqualified faculty, an end to various strict disciplinary policies, and amnesty for those involved in the strike. Due to the intervention of administrators and parents, the strike ended in defeat. But as scholar Andrew Rosa concluded, the \\"administration lost the war.\\"Andrew J. Rosa, \\"New Negroes on Campus: St. Clair Drake and the Culture of Education, Reform, and Rebellion at Hampton Institute,\\" History of Education Quarterly 53, no. 3 (August 2013): 203‚Äì232. Many reforms eventually became implemented, and Drake flourished at the college over the next three years there. In the course of his studies at Hampton, Drake served as the president of the student body, led the college chapter of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, became the editor of the Hampton Script, and even played on the college's soccer team. He graduated from Hampton in 1931 with a B.S. degree in Biology and a minor in English. Career as an academic From 1932 to 1933, Drake was on the faculty of the Christiansburg Institute, an African-American trade high school in Christiansburg, Virginia. At the Christiansburg Institute, he taught a variety of subjects, coached soccer, led chapel prayer, and began to write professionally. During this time Drake continued pursuing his interests in academic and social justice pursuits at Pendle Hill, a Quaker retreat and graduate center. Drake worked as an instructor at Dillard University in New Orleans from 1935 to 1937. In 1935, Drake also joined a research team led by Allison Davis, a former colleague from Howard University. The anthropological research explored the caste system of the American south, and they later published their observations in the book Deep South: A Social Anthropological Study of Caste and Class. Drake was moved by the potential that social science could have in racial causes, and ultimately followed Davis to study anthropology as a doctoral student at the University of Chicago.Baber (1999), pp. 200‚Äì1. During the late 1930s in Chicago, Drake worked as the assistant director for the Illinois State Commission on the Condition of the Urban Colored Population, and conducted research in churches serving Chicago's black community.\\"St. Clair Drake Papers, 1935-1990\\", New York Public Library. He returned briefly to Dillard in 1940 to work as an assistant professor, but was dismissed in the following year for supporting a student strike, and subsequently returned to his studies at Chicago. =After World War II= After World War II, he was the co-author, with Horace R. Cayton, Jr., of Black Metropolis, a study of the lives of African Americans living in Bronzeville, a neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. The book was characterized in Drake's obituary in the New York Times as \\"a landmark of objective research and one of the best urban studies produced by American scholarship\\". Drake became one of the more prolific chroniclers, in books and scholarly articles, of the turmoil and development of race relations in the 1960s. In 1946, Drake became an assistant professor of sociology at Roosevelt University along with chemist Edward Marion Augustus Chandler, modern dancer Sybil Shearer, and sociologist Rose Hum Lee. He remained a member of the Roosevelt sociology department until 1968. He commented years later that the offer to join Roosevelt came as \\"a surprise\\". He fully expected only to be considered by \\"Negro\\" colleges of the time. He found a home at Roosevelt which he embraced as an \\"experimental institution\\" where he was able to develop his calling as an \\"activist anthropologist,\\".George C. Bond and St. Clair Drake, \\"A Social Portrait of John Gibbs St. Clair Drake\\", American Ethnologist, 15(4), 1988, pp. 762‚Äì781, 775. He was perhaps the most distinguished faculty member ever to have taught at Roosevelt University, and was also one of the first black faculty members at Roosevelt. While there, he created one of the first African American Studies programs in the United States. Among his many honors, he received an honorary degree from Roosevelt.\\"Scholar In Afro-american Studies\\", Chicago Tribune, June 21, 1990. Drake taught at Roosevelt for 23 years before leaving in 1969 to found the African and African American Studies program at Stanford University. He remained at Stanford until his retirement in 1976. =Two years in the United Kingdom= Drake spent nearly two years in the United Kingdom, 1947-948. He conducted his dissertation research in 1947 in Cardiff, Wales, where he studied a community of African seamen and their Welsh families. Drake examined the forms of social action that arose in response to British racial and colonial domination. At this time, he was one of the first scholars studying race relations in the British Isles and was considered one of the foremost scholars on the subject. Kenneth Little published his PH.D. thesis, Negroes in Britain, which was a study of the Black and minority ethnic communities of Cardiff. Drake worked with the Black community of Cardiff, drafting a response in which the local community said they \\"distrust people who survey us and study us, who write about us and publicize us, and who try to reform and lead us.\\" =After retirement= Even after his retirement from the faculty at Stanford, Drake remained active as a scholar and author. Another of Drake's works, which demonstrates his continued interest in race relations throughout his career, was Black Folk Here and There: An Essay in History and Anthropology, published in two volumes in 1987 and 1990 as part of a series entitled Afro-American Culture and Society. One of Drake's former students characterizes his research as drawing heavily from urban sociology and history, which led his peers in the 1940s to see \\"his scholarship ... [as] more sociological than anthropological\\" and \\"virtually ignored within anthropology as a consequence.\\"Harrison, Faye V. (2008), Outsider Within: Reworking Anthropology in the Global Age. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, p. 38. Contributions to the Pan-African movement Drake's connections to the African continent began early in his academic career. He met Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, and Mbiyu Koinange when he was completing his fieldwork in Cardiff, Wales as a part of his dissertation at Chicago.\\"The Black Diaspora in Pan-African Perspective\\", Black Scholar, 7.1 1975: 2‚Äì13. Black World Foundation. October 7, 2013. As a result of this early contact with pan-African advocates, Drake pursued research projects in Liberia and Ghana in the 1950s, funded in part by a grant he received from the Ford Foundation.Baber (1999), pp. 204‚Äì205. From 1958 to 1961, Drake served as head of the department of sociology at the University of Ghana. Drake's connections allowed him to participate in increasingly important discussions connected to the newly independent nation of Ghana. At the request of George Padmore, Nkrumah's advisor, Drake presented and participated in the planning meetings for the All-African Peoples' Conference held at Accra in December 1958. Padmore's relationship with Drake \\"allowed Drake to acquire unrivaled knowledge of Ghana's political leaders.\\"Baber (1999), p. 205. Drake served as an informal adviser to leaders of several newly independent African nations in the early 1960s, particularly Nkrumah, who by this time had become Ghana's prime minister, but later chose to leave Africa and this political work after coups installed military leaders in many of these nations: Drake later remarked that he would not \\"work under generals.\\"Flint, Peter B., \\"St. Clair Drake, Pioneer in Study Of Black Americans, Dies at 79\\", New York Times, June 21, 1990. Drake's personal commitment to see Ghana succeed and his concerns about the privacy of the people and conversations he observed led him to elect not to publish books or articles based directly on his work in Africa or with African immigrants in Britain. However, he did conduct several research studies during his time in Africa with his wife and fellow anthropologist Elizabeth Dewey Johns, though these were not directly associated with his political or personal connections in the countries he visited. Drake was also able to further social interest in African countries through his work with the Peace Corps. He provided cultural sensitivity training for a group of 50 American students planning to work in Ghana.\\"Scholar in Afro-American studies,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, 1990. Personal life St. Clair Drake was married to a colleague, Elizabeth Dewey Johns. Johns was a graduate student in sociology at the University of Chicago when Drake began work there as a graduate student in anthropology. As a fellow student, she helped introduce Drake to theories connected with cultural and behavioral relativism. After their marriage, the two of them worked together conducting research in West Africa.Baber (1999), pp. 201‚Äì204. The couple raised two children, Sandra and Karl. During World War II, Drake was a conscientious objector in response to the U.S. military's segregation policies, and he served in a civilian capacity in the U.S. Maritime Service.

Function  In Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis, POR is a C-terminal domain of CYP102, a single-polypeptide self-sufficient soluble P450 system (P450 is an N-terminal domain). The general scheme of electron flow in the POR/P450 system is: The definitive evidence for the requirement of POR in cytochrome-P450-mediated reactions came from the work of Lu, Junk and Coon, who dissected the P450-containing mixed function oxidase system into three constituent components: POR, cytochrome P450, and lipids. Since all microsomal P450 enzymes require POR for catalysis, it is expected that disruption of POR would have devastating consequences. POR knockout mice are embryonic lethal, probably due to lack of electron transport to extrahepatic P450 enzymes since liver-specific knockout of POR yields phenotypically and reproductively normal mice that accumulate hepatic lipids and have remarkably diminished capacity of hepatic drug metabolism. The reduction of cytochrome P450 is not the only physiological function of POR. The final step of heme oxidation by mammalian heme oxygenase requires POR and O2. In yeast, POR affects the ferrireductase activity, probably transferring electrons to the flavocytochrome ferric reductase.  Gene organization  Human POR gene has 16 exons and the exons 2-16 code for a 677-amino acid POR protein (NCBI NP_000932.2). There is a single copy of 50 kb POR gene (NCBI NM_000941.2) in humans on chromosome 7 (7q11.23).  Mutations and polymorphisms  Five missense mutations (A287P, R457H, V492E, C569Y, and V608F) and a splicing mutation in the POR genes have been found in patients who had hormonal evidence for combined deficiencies of two steroidogenic cytochrome P450 enzymes - P450c17 CYP17A1, which catalyzes steroid 17Œ±-hydroxylation and 17,20 lyase reaction, and P450c21 21-Hydroxylase, which catalyzes steroid 21-hydroxylation. Another POR missense mutation Y181D has also been identified. Fifteen of nineteen patients having abnormal genitalia and disordered steroidogenesis were homozygous or apparent compound heterozygous for POR mutations that destroyed or dramatically inhibited POR activity. More than 200 variations in POR gene have been identified.  POR Deficiency ‚Äì Mixed Oxidase Disease  POR deficiency is the newest form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia first described in 2004. The index patient was a newborn 46,XX Japanese girl with craniosynostosis, hypertelorism, mid-face hypoplasia, radiohumeral synostosis, arachnodactyly and disordered steroidogenesis. However, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with POR deficiency are long known in the literature as so-called mixed oxidase disease, as POR deficiency typically shows a steroid profile that suggests combined deficiencies of steroid 21-hydroxylase and 17Œ±-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase activities. The clinical spectrum of POR deficiency ranges from severely affected children with ambiguous genitalia, adrenal insufficiency, and the Antley-Bixler skeletal malformation syndrome (ABS) to mildly affected individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome-like features. Some of the POR patients were born to mothers who became virilized during pregnancy, suggesting deficient placental aromatization of fetal androgens due to a lesion in microsomal aromatase resulting in low estrogen production, which was later confirmed by lower aromatase activities caused by POR mutations. However, it has also been suggested that fetal and maternal virilization in POR deficiency might be caused by increased dihydrotestosterone synthesis by the fetal gonad through an alternative \\"backdoor pathway\\" first described in the marsupials and later confirmed in humans. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of urinary steroids from pregnant women carrying a POR-deficient fetus described in an earlier report also supports the existence of this pathway, and the relevance of the backdoor pathway along with POR dependent steroidogenesis have become clearer from recent studies. The role of POR mutations beyond CAH are being investigated; and questions such as how POR mutations cause bony abnormalities and what role POR variants play in drug metabolism by hepatic P450s are being addressed in recent publications. However, reports of ABS in some offspring of mothers who were treated with fluconazole, an antifungal agent which interferes with cholesterol biosynthesis at the level of CYP51 activity - indicate that disordered drug metabolism may result from deficient POR activity. = Williams syndrome = Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the deletion of genetic material approximately 1.2 Mb from the POR gene (POR). Cells with this genetic deletion show reduced transcription of POR, it seems, due to the loss of a cis-regulatory element that alters expression of this gene. Some persons with Williams syndrome show characteristics of POR deficiency, including radioulnar synostosis and other skeletal abnormalities. Cases of mild impairment of cortisol and androgen synthesis have been noted, however, despite the fact that deficient POR impairs androgen synthesis, patients with Williams syndrome often show increased androgen levels. A similar increase in testosterone has been observed in a mouse model that has globally decreased POR expression. Structure The 3D crystal structure of human POR has been determined.); The molecule is composed of four structural domains: the FMN-binding domain, the connecting domain, the FAD-binding domain, and NADPH-binding domain. The FMN-binding domain is similar to the structure of FMN-containing protein flavodoxin, whereas the FAD-binding domain and NADPH-binding domains are similar to those of flavoprotein ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR). The connecting domain is situated between the flavodoxin-like and FNR-like domains. POR homologs The other enzymes containing homologs of POR are nitric oxide synthase (), NADPH:sulfite reductase (), and methionine synthase reductase ().

One who imposes a khumra on oneself in a given instance is said to be makhmir (). The rationale for a khumra comes from Deuteronomy 22:8, which states that when one builds a house, he must build a fence around the roof in order to avoid guilt should someone fall off the roof. This has been interpreted by many as a requirement to \\"build a fence around the Torah\\" in order to protect the mitzvot. An obligation or prohibition can be adopted by an individual or an entire community. Early references to khumrot are found in the Talmud, and the understanding and application of them has changed over time. Most often found in Orthodox Judaism, khumrot are variously seen as a precaution against transgressing the Halakha or as a way of keeping those who have taken on the stringency separate from those who have not. A second meaning of khumra is simply \\"a stricter interpretation of a Jewish law (Halakha), when two or more interpretations exist\\". This meaning is closely related to the first meaning, because people who follow the more lenient interpretation (qulla) believe that their interpretation is the baseline requirement of the law, and that people who observe the stringency are doing something \\"extra\\". However, people who observe the khumra, in this sense, believe that they are following the baseline requirement, and to do any less would be to violate halakha entirely. In many cases, a rule followed by the majority (or even totality) of halakha-observant Jews today is a stringency in comparison with more lenient rabbinic opinions which have existed in the past or even today. For example, universal halakhic practice today is to wait at least one hour (and even as much as six hours) after eating meat, before consuming milk. However, Rabbenu Tam, in 12th-century France, ruled that it was sufficient merely to conclude the meat meal by reciting a blessing and removing the tablecloth, and then milk could be consumed immediately. Thus, today's universal halakhic practice of waiting between meat and milk would be considered a khumra in comparison to Rabbenu Tam's ruling.

Social signals, or social stimuli, have an effect on reproduction in all mammals. For certain female mice, the pheromones contained in the urine of male mice can be such stimuli, inducing synchronous estrus.Ochiogu, Izuchukwu S., Chike F. Oguejiofor, and Ambrose N. Nwagbo. \\"Males' Non-Enhancement of Bruce and Whitten Effects in Female Mice ‚Äì Mus Musculus.\\" Animal Research International 6 (2009): 1077-081. When the pheromones contained in the urine of male mice stimulate synchronous estrus in a population of female mice, it is known as the Whitten effect. This is a phenomenon observed by Wesley K. Whitten (1956, 1966, 1968), whereby male mouse pheromone-laden urine synchronizes the estrus cycle \\"among unisexually grouped females,\\" and is an example of male-to-female pheromonal effects in mice, similar to the Bruce effect.Jemilio, Bozena, Scott Harvey, and Milos Novotny. \\"Promotion of the Whitten Effect in Female Mice by Synthetic Analogs of Male Urinary Constituents.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 83 (1986): 4576-579. The Whitten effect occurs when a group of female mice are exposed to the urine produced by a male mouse. The male‚Äôs urine contains certain volatile, or airborne, pheromones that affect the hormonal processes of the females that control their reproductive status. A sexually mature and viable male must produce the urine, as the pheromones that produce the Whitten effect are dependent on male sex hormones such as testosterone. The female mice do not require direct contact with the male‚Äôs urine to produce the Whitten effect, as the pheromone contained in the urine is airborne and therefore is taken up by the females through their olfactory system.Gangrade, B.K., and C.J. Dominik. \\"Studies of the Male- Originating Pheromones Involved in the Whitten Effect and Bruce Effect in Mice.\\" Biology of Reproduction 31 (1984): 89-96. The reproductive cycle of female mice in isolation is approximately 4 to 5 days, and the reproductive cycles of grouped females are often longer and more irregular.Ma, Weidong, Zhongshan Miao, and Milos V. Novotny. \\"Introduction of Estrus in Grouped Female Mice (Mus Domesticus) by Synthetic Analogs of Preputial Gland Constituents.\\" Chem. Senses 24 (1999): 289-93. However, when grouped female mice are exposed to the pheromones contained in a male‚Äôs urine, the Whitten effect occurs, and the majority of the female mice will enter a new estrus cycle by the third day of exposure.

The Stowe Recreation Path has received several awards and honors, and many people consider it a great improvement to the town.\\"History of the Stowe Recreation Path\\", Town of Stowe  Beginnings  The planning for a recreation path in Stowe was initiated in 1964 to combat heavy traffic on the Mountain Road (Route 108). The Stowe Better Business Association voted in favor of constructing a walking path running parallel to the Mountain Road in an attempt to reduce traffic. The idea was forgotten until 13 years later. In 1977, Claire Lintilhac commissioned the Vermont Highway Department to design a route along the Mountain Road. Plans were made, but nothing was done with them for four years. In 1981, a Bike Path Coordinator, Anne Lusk, was hired, and funds and land were acquired.  Construction and extension  Between 1981 and 1984, the first of the wide trail were paved and 16 bridges were constructed at a cost of $300,000. Easements across the 27 different parcels of land the path crossed were donated to the town.Lusk, Anne (November/December 1989). \\"Stowe, Vermont, Builds a Greenway: A Multi-purpose Path Rejuvenates Community Life\\" in Small Town, pp 14-21. A extension to the path was constructed between 1986 and 1989 at a cost of $380,000. In addition to the fundraising techniques used for the first leg, $120,000 was solicited from the town's tax funds. Due to the popularity of the first leg, the funds were granted. This second leg crossed land owned by 4 people, mostly agricultural land and included the construction of 4 bridges. When finished, the Bike Path was long, and had been completed at a cost of $680,000. Funding The $680,000 to build the path came from many sources. $186,000 came from private sources, $178,000 came from the Land and Water Conservation Funds, $134,000 came from the Lintilhac Foundation, which was started by Claire Lintilhac, $120,000 was set aside from local taxes, and $62,000 came from Revenue Sharing Funds. The majority of the $186,000 raised privately was acquired by selling pieces of the path: an inch cost $2, a foot was $15, and a yard was $45.

It is located on Gas Street, off Broad Street, and between the Mailbox and Brindleyplace canal-side developments. History The Birmingham Canal, completed in 1773, terminated at Old Wharf beyond Bridge Street. When the Worcester and Birmingham Company started their canal at a point later known as Gas Street Basin the Birmingham Canal Navigations Company (BCN) insisted on a physical barrier to prevent the Worcester and Birmingham Canal from benefiting from their water. The Worcester Bar, a straight barrier long was built perpendicular to the run of the two canals. Cargoes had to be laboriously manhandled between boats on either side. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal opened between Birmingham and Selly Oak on 30 October 1795 but took until 1815 to complete to Worcester, at which time, after much lobbying by iron and coal masters and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company, an Act of Parliament was passed to open up the bar and the bar lock was built. There were toll offices either side of the bar lock and tolls were collected by each company from boats using the canals. The Worcester Bar still exists, with boats moored to both sides of it. It is connected to Gas Street via a footbridge reconstructed to a design by Horseley Ironworks of the 19th century. During the 1990s much of the area around the basin was redeveloped and older buildings refurbished. The wall and ramp down from Gas Street, the Tap and Spile pub, and the neighbouring building are all grade II listed, as is the Martin & Chamberlain building built on top of the Broad Street Tunnel. In 1973, the basin featured prominently in the Cliff Richard film Take Me High. A canal-side cottage there was used as the home of a character in the long-running soap opera Crossroads.

Their construction was started by the Romans when they established the fortress of Deva Victrix between 70 and 80 AD. It originated with a rampart of earth and turf surmounted by a wooden palisade. From about 100 AD they were reconstructed using sandstone, but were not completed until over 100 years later. Following the Roman occupation nothing is known about the condition of the walls until √Üthelfl√¶d refounded Chester as a burgh in 907. The defences were improved, although the precise nature of the improvement is not known. After the Norman conquest, the walls were extended to the west and the south to form a complete circuit of the medieval city. The circuit was probably complete by the middle of the 12th century. Maintenance of the structure of the walls was an ongoing concern. They were further fortified before the Civil War, and were damaged during the war. Following this they ceased to have a defensive purpose, and were developed for leisure and recreation. The walls are now a major tourist attraction, and form an almost complete circuit of the former medieval city, with a total walkway length of . Upkeep and repair of the walls continues to be a problem. History =Military use= Roman-era sandstone ashlar is present within the lower tiers of the north west section. In about 74 or 75 AD the Roman legion Legio II Adiutrix established a fortress in Chester. The fortress was initially defended by an earth rampart surmounted by a wooden palisade and surrounded by a ditch with a sharp V-shaped profile. It is likely that the rampart was about high on a base of about . The earth for the rampart was obtained from digging the ditch. It was set on a base of logs and held together by branches and brushwood. At intervals of about along the ramparts were wooden towers with a square base of about ; they were probably about high. On each of the four sides was a main gate with timber towers. The gates on the north and east sides stood on the present sites of Northgate and Eastgate. From about 90 AD Chester was occupied by Legio XX Valeria Victrix, who started a programme of rebuilding, including the improvement of the walls. Starting in about 100 AD the earth walls were reconstructed using sandstone. A wall of stone was added to the earth rampart. This consisted of large square blocks of stone built on a chamfered plinth up to a walkway about above the base. It was surmounted by an elaborately carved cornice, and a parapet topped by capstones. The gates and towers were also rebuilt in stone. It is thought that the north gate was a single arch, while the others had twin portals. The east gate formed the main entry to the fortress, and was particularly impressive, possibly with three storeys. The stone was quarried locally from the immediate area of the fortress. Although started in about 100 AD, the rebuilding of the walls was abandoned in the early part of the 2nd century, perhaps with the walls incomplete, and was not finished until over 100 years later. The walls continued to be maintained throughout the Roman occupation, with major repairs undertaken during the 4th century. The south east section of the medieval walls by Barnaby's Tower. Nothing is known about the condition of the walls between the end of the Roman occupation in the late 4th century and the refounding of Chester by √Üthelfl√¶d as a burgh in 907 as part of the reconquest of Mercia by the Anglo-Saxons. Parts of the Roman walls were still present, as they continue to stand today. The Anglo-Saxons certainly repaired the northern and eastern sections of the Roman walls. At some time Roman stones, including tombstones, were used in repairs, but it uncertain whether this was during this period or later. There is evidence, including the discovery of a Saxon U-shaped ditch, that the wall was extended from the southeast corner of the Roman wall to the river, forming an L-shaped defence, but whether this would have been a stone or an earth defence is unknown. There is a reference to repairing the walls in the Domesday Survey. Following the Norman conquest the army of William the Conqueror arrived in Chester in 1069‚Äì70, and the king ordered that a castle should be built. This was constructed outside the site of the Roman fortress, to the southwest in an elevated position overlooking the River Dee. This necessitated the extension of the walls to the west and south to incorporate the castle, leading to the circuit of the walls currently present. Three new gates were built, the Watergate in the west wall, and the Shipgate and Bridgegate. The latter two gates were certainly built by the 1120s, and it is thought that the medieval circuit of the walls was complete by 1162. They then consisted of the curtain wall itself, gates, towers and a ditch. The Saxon ditch has been filled in, and the medieval ditches were dug further from the walls. The earlier ditch had been shallow, probably no more than deep. However, following a siege of Chester Castle during the Second Barons' War in 1265, a larger ditch was dug, this one being over 2 m (6 ft) deep. The finance required for the upkeep of the walls was mainly by a series of murages granted by the king, duties levied on merchandise passing into and out of the city. The main gates were under the control of hereditary sergeants who collected tolls and organised watches on the walls. During the 15th century the granting of murages was delegated to the city authorities, but keeping up with the necessary repairs was a continuing problem. Breaches occurred in 1569, 1608 and 1629, and in both 1589 and in 1641 the walls were described as being \\"ruinous\\". In the expectation of the coming Civil War, repairs were carried out in the early 1640s, and further fortifications were added to the walls and in the outer suburbs. The walls were heavily damaged during the siege of the city by Parliamentarian forces in 1645, this included two major breaches. =Recreational use= The Wishing steps in the south east corner of the city walls. After the end of the Civil War, the walls ceased to have any military or defensive function, and increasingly became used for recreational purposes. In 1707 the City Assembly made a grant of ¬£1,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to repair and re-flag the walls to make a walkway with an unfortified parapet. Notable people walking the walls in the early 18th century included John Wesley and Samuel Johnson. By this time the main gates were too narrow for the increasing traffic, so they were all rebuilt with wider arches. The gates had also prevented an unobstructed perambulation of the walls, and the opportunity was taken to carry the walkway over the new gates. Eastgate was replaced in 1768, Bridgegate in 1781, and Watergate in 1788. Other measures were taken to improve the accessibility for walkers; these included the building of Recorder's Steps in 1720 on the southern part of the walls, and the Wishing Steps in 1785 on a steeply inclined section to the east of the Recorder's Steps. Between 1808 and 1810 Northgate was rebuilt. This gate had contained the city gaol, and a new gaol was built in the south of the city. The gaol yard extended southwards towards the river and this necessitated removing Shipgate, thus creating a permanent breach in the wall. Improvements in transport in the 19th and 20th centuries have resulted in further alterations to the walls. Until the early 19th century the only bridge over the Dee had been the Old Dee Bridge immediately to the south of Bridgegate. In the 1820s Grosvenor Bridge was built, passing through the walls at the southwest corner. In 1846 the Chester and Holyhead Railway was built, cutting the walls and passing through arches under the northwest corner. By the 1930s road traffic had increased and was causing severe congestion in the middle of the city, particularly at Chester Cross. A new road was created to the south of the centre of the city, breaching the east wall to the west of the Amphitheatre. Newgate was built to allow the traffic to pass and to take the walkway over the road; this opened in 1938. Following the Second World War traffic increased further and in the 1960s the Inner Ring Road was built to take traffic from Grosvenor Bridge to the west of the city centre. Where it breached the north wall a concrete footbridge, named St Martin's Gate, was built and opened in 1966. Conservation Morgan's Mount, on the northern section of walls, was built for Royalist cannons during the English Civil War (pictured from St Martin's Gate). Chester city walls comprise the most complete Roman and medieval defensive town walls in Britain. The circuit, which measures almost in circumference, is now a major tourist attraction for visitors to the city. The walls are recognised as a Scheduled Monument, with every section of the walls recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. the only exception being the section of the walls between Bridgegate and the County Hall which is listed at Grade II*. The walk is approximately rectangular in plan, on a continuous elevated walkway, apart from a short section on the south of the city. It incorporates medieval structures, including Bonewaldesthorne's Tower, attached to the Water Tower at the northwest corner, Pemberton's Parlour and Morgan's Mount on the north section of the walls, Phoenix Tower, Thimbleby's Tower and Barnaby's Tower on the east section of the walls, and the base of a drum tower on the south section. It crosses roads on the four major medieval gates to the city, Northgate, Eastgate, Bridgegate, and Watergate, and more modern roads on Newgate and St Martin's Gate. The walk also crosses Kaleyard Gate on the eastern section of the walls, and passes the Recorder's Steps on the south section. Upkeep and repair of the walls is an ongoing conservation project. In 2008 part of the wall collapsed near the Eastgate. After repairs, the section was reopened in 2010. There have been several fatal accidents of people falling from the walls. Since 2011, a section of wall between Morgan's Mount and Northgate Bridge has been closed because it was found to be moving and had to be propped up. In January 2020 a SE section of wall collapsed while development work was being carried out nearby.

It is a comprehensive school for children of ages 11‚Äì18 from Ayr. Ayr Academy's catchment area covers Newton-on-Ayr, Whitletts and the outlying villages of Coylton, Annbank, and Mossblown. In 2007, the closure of Mainholm Academy resulted in the addition of approximately 100 pupils attending Ayr Academy. As of November 2017, 426 pupils attended Ayr Academy which is the smallest pupil intake numbers in the whole of South Ayrshire. The school's motto, Respice, Prospice, is Latin for \\"Look Backwards, Look Forwards\\". In economical terms, Ayr Academy is one of the schools within South Ayrshire with high levels of economic deprivation and disadvantage, with more pupils attending Ayr Academy from deprived backgrounds than most within South Ayrshire. This was highlighted nationally in 2015 upon the release of national examination results across Scotland, with Ayr Academy's performance in the national examinations being the worst in South Ayrshire ‚Äì Director of Education for South Ayrshire Council, Douglas Hutchinson, claiming that \\"Research shows that young people who are less economically advantaged achieve less well across Scotland. Therefore, to compare schools that may experience greater levels of deprivation does not reflect the hard work by staff and young people\\". Pupils who attend Ayr Academy reside in areas that are north of Ayr, including neighbourhoods such as Whitletts and Dalmilling as well as former coal mining villages. Comparing this to nearby Kyle Academy where pupils reside in more affluent areas of Ayr such Park Circus and Bellevue Crescent, the examination results for Kyle Academy was the best for the South Ayrshire area in comparison to Ayr Academy performing the worst. The new school was built within Craigie and the handover to South Ayrshire Council was completed on 4 August 2017 for the start of term on 18 August 2017. The old Ayr Academy closed for the final time to pupils on 23 June 2017 and to staff on 28 June 2017. History The school has existed, in various guises, since 1233 although it did not come to be known as Ayr Academy until 1796. It moved from the Sandgate to its location on Fort Street in 1800, with a further extension to the building added in the 1930s where it remained until the new school was built within Craigie and the Fort Street building closed in 2017. After the Reformation the school was taken over by the council of the Royal Burgh of Ayr, the school moved to its former site on Fort Street in Ayr town centre site in 1602. In 1794 a Royal Charter converted the school into Ayr Academy. Ayr Academy's coat of arms was awarded in 1912 and bears the school motto Respice Prospice which means look backwards, look forward. In November 2016, following a decision made at a leadership panel of South Ayrshire Council, it was decided by councillors and South Ayrshire Council's Director of Education, Douglas Hutchinson, that for the first time since its establishment, Ayr Academy would not have a sole Head Teacher leading the schools staff, pupils and curriculum. Rather, a controversial decision was made to share a Head Teacher with nearby secondary school Kyle Academy. The controversial decision was met with harsh reactions from parents and carers of children attending both Ayr and Kyle Academies, with many speculating that in the future that both schools would merge to save money ‚Äì a rumour South Ayrshire Council has since denied. Ayr Academy's Fort Street site had fallen into a state of disrepair, leading South Ayrshire Council to put forward proposals to construct a new build at University Avenue on the Craigie estate in Ayr, costing ¬£25 million to create the Ayr Academy Learning Campus. Construction for the new school commenced in January 2016, with the new school opening to staff and pupils in August 2017. The new Ayr Academy build has the capacity for up to 1,000 pupils and will include two unique ‚Äòlearning plazas‚Äô ‚Äì open spaces that can be used to bring together multiple classes for collaborative learning and discussions. The project was delivered by Hub South West, created in conjunction with SFT and other partner organisations to deliver major public sector building projects. Construction work was undertaken by Kier Construction. Shared Head Teacher (2016‚Äì2018) On 1 November 2016, South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel approved to pilot a Shared Headship arrangement between Ayr Academy and Kyle Academy due to a number of factors which had resulted in pupil attainment in national qualifications in National 5 and Higher Qualifications being significantly lower than national comparators. The purpose of the Shared Headship programme was to ensure sharing of practice and standards in order to raise attainment at Ayr Academy. The pilot has proved successful in addressing the areas identified within the November 2016 report to the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel. Overall, there has been an increase in attainment at every level within Ayr Academy except for advanced higher; the decline in pupil roll is reversing with less placing requests being made out of Ayr Academy, pupil attendance has improved, along with exclusion numbers declining. Due to greater community and parental engagement, transitions from primary to secondary are more effective and smooth for children; there is greater pupil participation in initiatives such as the Scottish Rugby School and SFA School of Football and project working with Community Learning and Development. Additionally, there has also been a successful move to a new fit for purpose Ayr Academy school building that was completed and opened in August 2017.https://ww20.south- ayrshire.gov.uk/ext/committee/committeepapers2017/Leadership%20Panel/28%20November%202017/Tabled%20Item.pdf The Shared Headship programme was set to run until June 2018, with reports being published in September 2018 by South Ayrshire Council to determine its success. However, in November 2017, it was reported that Lyndsay McRoberts, Executive Head Teacher at Ayr Academy (and Kyle Academy), was appointed to Head Teacher at Duncanrig Secondary School in East Kilbride. This has resulted South Ayrshire making the decision to advertise for both Head Teacher posts at both Ayr and Kyle Academies, despite the Shared Headship trial not yet being completed. The post of Executive Depute Head Teacher at both Ayr and Kyle Academies will remain in place until June 2018.

These proteins contain a conserved basic DNA binding domain that binds the E box DNA motif. They dimerize with other HLH containing proteins through an HLH-HLH interaction.  MRF Gene Family Evolution  There are typically four vertebrate MRF paralogues which are homologous to typically a single MRF gene in non-vertebrates. These four genes are thought to have been duplicated in the two rounds of whole-genome duplication early in vertebrate evolution that played a role in the evolution of more complex vertebrate body plans. The four MRFs have four distinct expression profiles, though with some redundancy, as MyoD and Myf5 are both involved in myoblast determination, and are followed by the activation of Myf6 (MRF4) and Myog in myoblast differentiation. There have also been instances of independent duplication of the MRFs in invertebrate lineages, similarly followed by subfunctionalization of the expression of the genes in time and/or in space. In amphioxus, an invertebrate chordate closely related to vertebrates, there are five MRFs which are expressed in different patterns during development.

In August 1995, the institution was renamed the Kangan Institute of TAFE in honour of Myer Kangan, the founder of the TAFE system in Australia. On 1 July 1997, it merged with the John Batman College of TAFE to form Kangan Batman TAFE. The merger resulted in the closure of the former John Batman TAFE's campus in Gaffney Street, Coburg, but the amalgamated body expanded again in 1998 when it absorbed the Richmond Automotive Campus of Barton TAFE after a major state government review. The Avondale Heights campus closed in 2005. The \\"Automotive Centre of Excellence\\" campus at Docklands initially opened in September 2006; the completion of the three-stage Docklands development in 2011 resulted in the closure of the remaining Coburg campus (Dawson Street). The organisation reverted to the \\"Kangan Institute\\" name in 2010, dropping the reference to \\"Batman\\" from the 1997 merger. In 2014, it formally merged with Bendigo TAFE to form the Bendigo Kangan Institute. The two organisations retained their separate operational branding, but formed a shared administration based in Bendigo. The then state opposition Labor Party and the Australian Education Union criticised the merger over process and funding concerns. Campuses Kangan Institute operates five campuses: Broadmeadows, Essendon, a health campus at Moonee Ponds, a creative industries campus in Richmond and the Automotive Centre of Excellence in Docklands.

R. P. Dickson in Kuwait in 1919. Lieutenant Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson (4 February 1881 - 14 June 1959) was a British colonial administrator in the Middle East from the 1920s until the 1940s, and author of several books on Kuwait. Life H. R. P. Dickson was one of six children of John Dickson, a diplomat in the Levant from 1872‚Äì1906, and Edith Wills. He was born in Beirut, Lebanon and was taken at a young age to Damascus, Syria where his father was Consul. There his mother's milk failed and Shaikh Mijwal al Mazrab, the husband of Lady Jane Digby, provided the young child with a wet nurse from the 'Anizah tribe. Islamic law lays out the permanent family-like relationships that are created by wet nursing, and this \\"blood affinity\\" between Dickson and the 'Anizah meant he was treated as a member of the tribe. He stated that this blood tie 'in later life has been of assistance to me in my dealings with the Badawin [bedouin] of the high desert and around Kuwait'. Following the death of Lady Jane Digby, the Dickson family rented her house in Damascus, and Dickson recalled that he 'spent my childhood days rambling about the lovely garden that had once been [her] pride and happiness.'. Dickson met his wife Dame Violet Dickson n√©e Lucas-Calcraft (1896 - 1991) in Marseilles, France, shortly after the end of World War I, where she was working in a bank. She travelled out to meet him in India, where he was stationed and where they were married. Shortly afterwards he was posted to Iraq. Dickson served as British Political Agent in Bahrain from 1919-1920. He also served in Persia (present-day Iran). In 1929 he was appointed British Political Agent to Kuwait, and served in this role until 1936. He briefly held this role again in 1941. Some of his reports have been published in Political Diaries of the Arab World: Persian Gulf 1904-1965. The publishers' description of this volume reads in part: \\"Perhaps the most idiosyncratic [contributor to the volume] was Lt. Col. H. R. P. Dickson who wrote voluminously in the 1920s and 1930s on his trips into the Saudi hinterland, his meetings with rulers and all the machinations and gossip that sometimes go into political intelligence- gathering.\\" After retiring from his political career he worked for the Kuwait Oil Company, for which company he had been the first Chief Local Representative in Kuwait. Dickson had a detailed knowledge of bedouin life and customs, and produced two books which are considered valuable chronicles of a now-threatened way of life. These books, The Arab of the Desert: A Glimpse into Badawin Life in Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia, first published in 1949, and Kuwait and her Neighbours, first published in 1956, have been described as 'monumental', and are now sought-after collector's items.

The Dickson House Cultural Centre, Kuwait City The British Political Agency in Kuwait was based in a house that had been built in 1870 for a Kuwaiti merchant. The Dicksons moved into the house in 1929, and the building served as the British political agency until 1935. Dickson lived there until his death in 1959 and Dame Violet until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when she was evacuated to Britain. Dame Violet died before the liberation of Kuwait. The house was ransacked during the invasion, but has since been restored by the Kuwaiti National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters, and is now a tourist attraction. It is one of few surviving examples of nineteenth century Kuwaiti architecture, with thirty rooms on two floors. H. R. P. Dickson archive Papers by and relating to H. R. P.

The word order is therefore Aux-S (auxiliary‚Äìsubject), which is the opposite of the canonical SV (subject‚Äìverb) order of declarative clauses in English. The most frequent use of subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion in English is in the formation of questions, although it also has other uses, including the formation of condition clauses, and in the syntax of sentences beginning with negative expressions (negative inversion). In certain types of English sentences, inversion is also possible with verbs other than auxiliaries; these are described in the article on subject-verb inversion. Overview Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion involves placing the subject after a finite auxiliary verb,Concerning the obligatory status of the verb that undergoes inversion as an auxiliary, see Radford (1988:149f.). rather than before it as is the case in typical declarative sentences (the canonical word order of English being subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject). The auxiliary verbs which may participate in such inversion (e.g. is, can, have, will, etc.) are described at English auxiliaries and contractions. Note that forms of the verb be are included regardless of whether or not they function as auxiliaries in the sense of governing another verb form. (For exceptions to this restriction, see below.) A typical example of subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion is given below. ::a. Sam has read the paper. ::b. Has Sam read the paper? Here the subject is Sam, and the verb has is an auxiliary. In the question, these two elements change places (invert). If the sentence does not have an auxiliary verb, this type of simple inversion is not possible. Instead, an auxiliary must be introduced into the sentence in order to allow inversion:Concerning do-support, see for instance Bach (1974:94), Greenbaum and Quirk (1990:232), Ouhalla (1994:62ff.). ::a. Sam enjoys the paper. ::b. *Enjoys Sam the paper? ::c. Does Sam enjoy the paper? For details of the use of do, did and does for this and similar purposes, see do-support. For exceptions to the principle that the inverted verb must be an auxiliary, see below. It is also possible for the subject to invert with a negative contraction (can't, isn't, etc.). For example: ::a. He isn't nice. ::b. Isn't he nice? Compare this with the uncontracted form Is he not nice? and the archaic Is not he nice?. Uses of subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion The main uses of subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion in English are described in the following sections, although other types can occasionally be found.Concerning the environments illustrated here in which subject-auxiliary inversion can or must occur, they are illustrated and discussed in numerous places in the literature, e.g. Bach (1974:93), Quirk et al. (1979:378f.), Greenbaum and Quirk (1990:232, 410f.), Downing and Locke (1992:22f, 230f.). Most of these uses of inversion are restricted to main clauses; they are not found in subordinate clauses. However other types (such as inversion in condition clauses) are specific to subordinate clauses. =In questions= The most common use of subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion in English is in question formation. It appears in yes‚Äìno questions: ::a. Sam has read the paper. ::b. Has Sam read the paper? and also in questions introduced by other interrogative words (wh- questions): ::a. Sam is reading the paper. ::b. What is Sam reading? Inversion does not occur, however, when the interrogative word is the subject or is contained in the subject. In this case the subject remains before the verb (it can be said that wh-fronting takes precedence over subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion): ::a. Somebody has read the paper. ::b. Who has read the paper? ::c. Which fool has read the paper? Inversion also does not normally occur in indirect questions, where the question is no longer in the main clause, due to the penthouse principle. For example: ::a. \\"What did Sam eat?\\", Cathy wonders. ::b. *Cathy wonders what did Sam eat. ::c. Cathy wonders what Sam ate. Similarly: ::a. We asked whether Tom had left. ::b. *We asked whether had Tom left. =Negative inversion= Another use of subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion is in sentences which begin with certain types of expressions which contain a negation or have negative force. For example, ::a. Jessica will say that at no time. ::b. At no time will Jessica say that. This is described in detail at negative inversion. =Inversion in condition clauses= Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion can be used in certain types of subordinate clause expressing a condition: ::a. If the general had not ordered the advance,... ::b. Had the general not ordered the advance,... Note that when the condition is expressed using inversion, the conjunction if is omitted. More possibilities are given at , and variations are described at . =Other cases= Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion is used after the anaphoric particle so, mainly in elliptical sentences. The same frequently occurs in elliptical clauses beginning with as. ::a. Fred fell asleep, and Jim did too. ::b. Fred fell asleep, and so did Jim. ::c. Fred fell asleep, as did Jim. Inversion also occurs following an expression beginning with so or such, as in: ::a. We felt so tired (such tiredness) that we fell asleep. ::b. So tired (Such tiredness) did we feel that we fell asleep. Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion may optionally be used in elliptical clauses introduced by the particle of comparison than: ::a. Sally knows more languages than her father does. ::b. Sally knows more languages than does her father. Inversion with other types of verb There are certain sentence patterns in English in which subject‚Äìverb inversion takes place where the verb is not restricted to an auxiliary verb. Here the subject may invert with certain main verbs, e.g. After the pleasure comes the pain, or with a chain of verbs, e.g. In the box will be a bottle. These are described in the article on subject-verb inversion. Further, inversion was not limited to auxiliaries in older forms of English. Examples of non-auxiliary verbs being used in typical subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion patterns may be found in older texts or in English written in an archaic style: ::Know you what it is to be a child? (Francis Thompson) The verb have, when used to denote broadly defined possession (and hence not as an auxiliary), is still sometimes used in this way in modern standard English: ::Have you any idea what this would cost? Inversion as a remnant of V2 word order In some cases of subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion, such as negative inversion, the effect is to put the finite auxiliary verb into second position in the sentence. In these cases, inversion in English results in word order that is like the V2 word order of other Germanic languages (Danish, Dutch, Frisian, Icelandic, German, Norwegian, Swedish, Yiddish, etc.). These instances of inversion are remnants of the V2 pattern that formerly existed in English as it still does in its related languages. Old English followed a consistent V2 word order. Structural analyses Syntactic theories based on phrase structure typically analyze subject-aux inversion using syntactic movement. In such theories, a sentence with subject-aux inversion has an underlying structure where the auxiliary is embedded deeper in the structure. When the movement rule applies, it moves the auxiliary to the beginning of the sentence.For examples of the movement-type analysis of subject-auxiliary inversion, see for instance Ouhalla (1994:62ff.), Culicover (1997:337f.), Adger (2003:294), Radford (1988: 411ff., 2004: 123ff). ::Subject-auxiliary inversion illustration 1' An alternative analysis does not acknowledge the binary division of the clause into subject NP and predicate VP, but rather it places the finite verb as the root of the entire sentence and views the subject as switching to the other side of the finite verb. No discontinuity is perceived. Dependency grammars are likely to pursue this sort of analysis.Concerning the dependency grammar analysis of inversion, see Hudson (1990: 214-216) and Gro√ü and Osborne (2009: 64-66). The following dependency trees illustrate how this alternative account can be understood: ::Subject-auxiliary inversion trees 2 These trees show the finite verb as the root of all sentence structure. The hierarchy of words remains the same across the a- and b-trees. If movement occurs at all, it occurs rightward (not leftward); the subject moves rightward to appear as a post-dependent of its head, which is the finite auxiliary verb.

(2004) Hearing ‚Äì An Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics 4th Ed. New York, Marcel Dekker Auditory masking in the frequency domain is known as simultaneous masking, frequency masking or spectral masking. Auditory masking in the time domain is known as temporal masking or non-simultaneous masking. Masked threshold The unmasked threshold is the quietest level of the signal which can be perceived without a masking signal present. The masked threshold is the quietest level of the signal perceived when combined with a specific masking noise. The amount of masking is the difference between the masked and unmasked thresholds. Figure A ‚Äì adapted from Gelfand (2004) Gelfand provides a basic example.Gelfand, S.A. (2004) Hearing ‚Äì An Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics 4th Ed. New York, Marcel Dekker Let us say that for a given individual, the sound of a cat scratching a post in an otherwise quiet environment is first audible at a level of 10 dB SPL. However, in the presence of a masking noise (for example, a vacuum cleaner that is running simultaneously) that same individual cannot detect the sound of the cat scratching unless the level of the scratching sound is at least 26 dB SPL. We would say that the unmasked threshold for that individual for the target sound (i.e., the cat scratching) is 10 dB SPL, while the masked threshold is 26 dB SPL. The amount of masking is simply the difference between these two thresholds: 16 dB. The amount of masking will vary depending on the characteristics of both the target signal and the masker, and will also be specific to an individual listener. While the person in the example above was able to detect the cat scratching at 26 dB SPL, another person may not be able to hear the cat scratching while the vacuum was on until the sound level of the cat scratching was increased to 30 dB SPL (thereby making the amount of masking for the second listener 20 dB).  Simultaneous masking  Simultaneous masking occurs when a sound is made inaudible by a noise or unwanted sound of the same duration as the original sound.Moore, B.C.J. (2004) An Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing, 5th Ed. London, Elsevier Academic Press For example, a powerful spike at 1 kHz will tend to mask out a lower-level tone at 1.1 kHz. Also, two sine tones at 440 and 450 Hz can be perceived clearly when separated. They cannot be perceived clearly when presented simultaneously. =Critical bandwidth= If two sounds of two different frequencies are played at the same time, two separate sounds can often be heard rather than a combination tone. The ability to hear frequencies separately is known as frequency resolution or frequency selectivity. When signals are perceived as a combination tone, they are said to reside in the same critical bandwidth. This effect is thought to occur due to filtering within the cochlea, the hearing organ in the inner ear. A complex sound is split into different frequency components and these components cause a peak in the pattern of vibration at a specific place on the cilia inside the basilar membrane within the cochlea. These components are then coded independently on the auditory nerve which transmits sound information to the brain. This individual coding only occurs if the frequency components are different enough in frequency, otherwise they are in the same critical band and are coded at the same place and are perceived as one sound instead of two.Moore, B.C.J. (1986) Frequency Selectivity in Hearing, London, Academic Press The filters that distinguish one sound from another are called auditory filters, listening channels or critical bandwidths. Frequency resolution occurs on the basilar membrane due to the listener choosing a filter which is centered over the frequency they expect to hear, the signal frequency. A sharply tuned filter has good frequency resolution as it allows the center frequencies through but not other frequencies (Pickles 1982). Damage to the cochlea and the outer hair cells in the cochlea can impair the ability to tell sounds apart (Moore 1986). This explains why someone with a hearing loss due to cochlea damage would have more difficulty than a normal hearing person in distinguishing between different consonants in speech.Moore, B.C.J. (1995) Perceptual Consequences of Cochlear Damage, Oxford, Oxford University Press Masking illustrates the limits of frequency selectivity. If a signal is masked by a masker with a different frequency to the signal, then the auditory system was unable to distinguish between the two frequencies. By experimenting with conditions where one sound can mask a previously heard signal, the frequency selectivity of the auditory system can be tested.Moore, B.C.J. (1998) Cochlear Hearing Loss, London, Whurr Publishers Ltd =Similar frequencies= Figure B ‚Äì Adapted from Ehmer How effective the masker is at raising the threshold of the signal depends on the frequency of the signal and the frequency of the masker. The graphs in Figure B are a series of masking patterns, also known as masking audiograms. Each graph shows the amount of masking produced at each masker frequency shown at the top corner, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz. For example, in the first graph the masker is presented at a frequency of 250 Hz at the same time as the signal. The amount the masker increases the threshold of the signal is plotted and this is repeated for different signal frequencies, shown on the X axis. The frequency of the masker is kept constant. The masking effect is shown in each graph at various masker sound levels. Figure C ‚Äì Adapted from Gelfand 2004 Figure D ‚Äì Adapted from Gelfand 2004 Figure B shows along the Y axis the amount of masking. The greatest masking is when the masker and the signal are the same frequency and this decreases as the signal frequency moves further away from the masker frequency. This phenomenon is called on-frequency masking and occurs because the masker and signal are within the same auditory filter (Figure C). This means that the listener cannot distinguish between them and they are perceived as one sound with the quieter sound masked by the louder one (Figure D). Figure E ‚Äì adapted from Moore 1998 The amount the masker raises the threshold of the signal is much less in off-frequency masking, but it does have some masking effect because some of the masker overlaps into the auditory filter of the signal (Figure E) Figure F ‚Äì adapted from Moore 1998Off-frequency masking requires the level of the masker to be greater in order to have a masking effect; this is shown in Figure F. This is because only a certain amount of the masker overlaps into the auditory filter of the signal and more masker is needed to cover the signal. =Lower frequencies= The masking pattern changes depending on the frequency of the masker and the intensity (Figure B). For low levels on the 1000 Hz graph, such as the 20‚Äì40 dB range, the curve is relatively parallel. As the masker intensity increases the curves separate, especially for signals at a frequency higher than the masker. This shows that there is a spread of the masking effect upward in frequency as the intensity of the masker is increased. The curve is much shallower in the high frequencies than in the low frequencies. This flattening is called upward spread of masking and is why an interfering sound masks high frequency signals much better than low frequency signals. Figure B also shows that as the masker frequency increases, the masking patterns become increasingly compressed. This demonstrates that high frequency maskers are only effective over a narrow range of frequencies, close to the masker frequency. Low frequency maskers on the other hand are effective over a wide frequency range. Figure G ‚Äì adapted from a diagram by Gelfand Harvey Fletcher carried out an experiment to discover how much of a band of noise contributes to the masking of a tone. In the experiment, a fixed tone signal had various bandwidths of noise centered on it. The masked threshold was recorded for each bandwidth. His research showed that there is a critical bandwidth of noise which causes the maximum masking effect and energy outside that band does not affect the masking. This can be explained by the auditory system having an auditory filter which is centered over the frequency of the tone. The bandwidth of the masker that is within this auditory filter effectively masks the tone but the masker outside of the filter has no effect (Figure G). This is used in MP3 files to reduce the size of audio files. Parts of the signals which are outside the critical bandwidth are represented with reduced precision. The parts of the signals which are perceived by the listener are reproduced with higher fidelity. =Effects of intensity= Figure H ‚Äì adapted from Moore 1998 Varying intensity levels can also have an effect on masking. The lower end of the filter becomes flatter with increasing decibel level, whereas the higher end becomes slightly steeper. Changes in slope of the high frequency side of the filter with intensity are less consistent than they are at low frequencies. At the medium frequencies (1‚Äì4 kHz) the slope increases as intensity increases, but at the low frequencies there is no clear inclination with level and the filters at high center frequencies show a small decrease in slope with increasing level. The sharpness of the filter depends on the input level and not the output level to the filter. The lower side of the auditory filter also broadens with increasing level. These observations are illustrated in Figure H. Temporal masking Temporal masking or non-simultaneous masking occurs when a sudden stimulus sound makes inaudible other sounds which are present immediately preceding or following the stimulus. Masking which obscures a sound immediately preceding the masker is called backward masking or pre-masking and masking which obscures a sound immediately following the masker is called forward masking or post-masking. Temporal masking's effectiveness attenuates exponentially from the onset and offset of the masker, with the onset attenuation lasting approximately 20 ms and the offset attenuation lasting approximately 100 ms. Similar to simultaneous masking, temporal masking reveals the frequency analysis performed by the auditory system; forward masking thresholds for complex harmonic tones (e.g., a sawtooth probe with a fundamental frequency of 500 Hz) exhibit threshold peaks (i.e., high masking levels) for frequency bands centered on the first several harmonics. In fact, auditory bandwidths measured from forward masking thresholds are narrower and more accurate than those measured using simultaneous masking. Temporal masking should not be confused with the ear's acoustic reflex, an involuntary response in the middle ear that is activated to protect the ear's delicate structures from loud sounds. Other masking conditions figure I ‚Äì ipsilateral simultaneous masking Ipsilateral (\\"same side\\") masking is not the only condition where masking takes place. Another situation where masking occurs is called contralateral (\\"other side\\") simultaneous masking. In this case, the instance where the signal might be audible in one ear but is deliberately taken away by applying a masker to the other ear. The last situation where masking occurs is called central masking. This refers to the case where a masker causes a threshold elevation. This can be in the absence of, or in addition to, another effect and is due to interactions within the central nervous system between the separate neural inputs obtained from the masker and the signal. Effects of different stimulus types Experiments have been carried out to see the different masking effects when using a masker which is either in the form of a narrow band noise or a sinusoidal tone. When a sinusoidal signal and a sinusoidal masker (tone) are presented simultaneously the envelope of the combined stimulus fluctuates in a regular pattern described as beats. The fluctuations occur at a rate defined by the difference between the frequencies of the two sounds. If the frequency difference is small then the sound is perceived as a periodic change in the loudness of a single tone. If the beats are fast then this can be described as a sensation of roughness. When there is a large frequency separation, the two components are heard as separate tones without roughness or beats. Beats can be a cue to the presence of a signal even when the signal itself is not audible. The influence of beats can be reduced by using a narrowband noise rather than a sinusoidal tone for either signal or masker. Mechanisms of masking There are many different mechanisms of masking, one being suppression. This is when there is a reduction of a response to a signal due to the presence of another. This happens because the original neural activity caused by the first signal is reduced by the neural activity of the other sound.Oxenham, A.J. Plack, C.J. Suppression and the upward spread of masking, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 104 (6) pp. 3500‚Äì10 Combination tones are products of a signal and a masker. This happens when the two sounds interact causing new sound, which can be more audible than the original signal. This is caused by the non linear distortion that happens in the ear. For example, the combination tone of two maskers can be a better masker than the two original maskers alone. The sounds interact in many ways depending on the difference in frequency between the two sounds. The most important two are cubic difference tones and quadratic difference tones . Cubic difference tones are calculated by the sum. 2F1 ‚Äì F2Lee, Kyogu and Kim, Minjong. Estimating the Amplitude of the Cubic Difference Tone Using a Third-Order Adaptive Volterra Filter, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx‚Äô05), Madrid, Spain, September 20‚Äì22, 2005, p. 297 (F1 being the first frequency, F2 the second) These are audible most of the time and especially when the level of the original tone is low. Hence they have a greater effect on psychoacoustic tuning curves than quadratic difference tones. Quadratic difference tones are the result of F2 ‚Äì F1 This happens at relatively high levels hence have a lesser effect on psychoacoustic tuning curves. Combination tones can interact with primary tones resulting in secondary combination tones due to being like their original primary tones in nature, stimulus like. An example of this is 3F1 ‚Äì 2F2 Secondary combination tones are again similar to the combination tones of the primary tone. Off frequency listening Off frequency listening is when a listener chooses a filter just lower than the signal frequency to improve their auditory performance. This ‚Äúoff frequency‚Äù filter reduces the level of the masker more than the signal at the output level of the filter, which means they can hear the signal more clearly hence causing an improvement of auditory performance. Applications Auditory masking is used in tinnitus maskers to suppress annoying ringing, hissing, or buzzing or tinnitus often associated with hearing loss. It is also used in various kinds of audiometry, including pure tone audiometry, and the standard hearing test to test each ear unilaterally and to test speech recognition in the presence of partially masking noise. Auditory masking is exploited to perform data compression for sound signals (MP3).

In 2007, OFSTED rated the school as \\"good\\". In 2010, OFSTED described it as \\"good with outstanding features\\". In 2014, the school was judged to be requiring improvement overall. In 2016, the OFSTED report described the school as \\"good\\". School history Playing fields of Hathershaw College, the college buildings are in the centre background As the 'Hathershaw Technical High School', it opened in 1955; it had a selective intake. The school was housed in three blocks (a main building, a science block and a craft/engineering block). The school was sponsored by the aviation manufacturer Avro, and the ground plan of the main building was inspired by the outline of a Lancaster bomber. It competed for intake with Oldham's state grammar schools, but offered a more technical syllabus. Provision of equipment and machinery for metalwork and woodwork was considered to be amongst the finest available nationally. In 1966 the school became a co-educational comprehensive school. In 1970 it was made into an 'upper-school' for pupils in the 14‚Äì18 age range, supplied by two separate 'lower-schools', Greenhill and Fitton Hill. The two feeder schools, which were on sites significantly distant from each other and Hathershaw School, educated pupils from 11 to 14 years of age. In the school year 1977‚Äì78 the system was reorganized and Hathershaw again catered for the full 11 to 18 age range, with sixth form entry. In the same year the school uniform colours changed from blue/black to maroon/grey, at present they are maroon/black. The loss of selective entry in 1966 and the system of split-site feeder schools led to a period of falling academic attainment. The trend was reversed after the appointment of John Cole to the headship in 1976. He has been credited as having \\"transformed Hathershaw School.\\" In 1981, Oldham's first joint school/community sports hall was built. In a 1992 reorganisation, it became an 11-16 school - losing its sixth form to Oldham Sixth Form College. In December 1999 it was recognised by the government as one of the 50 most improved secondary schools in the country. In September 2000 the school became a Technology College and in May 2003 was admitted to the Specialist Schools Trust \\"Value Added\\" club for significantly improving examination results between Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4.Taylor and Ryan, pp. 103‚Äì104. Taylor, Cyril and Ryan, Conor (2004) Excellence in Education: the Making of Great Schools, David Fulton. In November 2004, the school received more than ¬£1 million in lottery funding to improve its sports facilities. Hathershaw became the first dual-specialism school in England, in March 2005, specialising in sport as well as technology. In October 2005, the school opened a ¬£350,000 netball complex. The OFSTED inspection of November 2007 gave the school an overall rating of \\"good\\". In November 2010, the school was re-visited by OFSTED and given the official description 'good with outstanding features'. On 1 August 2011, The Hathershaw College gained academy status. In 2016, the College achieved its best GCSE results to date: with 60% gaining 5 A*-C grades including both English and Maths, above both local and national averages. This was equalled in 2017, despite the introduction of the new numerical GCSE grading system in Maths and English. In April 2016 the OFSTED inspection rated the school as \\"good\\".

Early life Vladimir Peniakoff was born on 30 March 1897 in Huy, Belgium, to affluent Jewish Russian emigre parents where his father, Dmitri, owned and operated an aluminium factory. Peniakoff began an engineering degree at Free University of Brussels at the age of 15 before his studies were interrupted by the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914.Willett. Popski. Willett interviewed many of Popski's surviving Jewish relatives after World War II. His father took him to England where Peniakoff resumed his studies at St John's College, Cambridge reading mathematics. He initially had conscientious objections to participation in the conflict, but by his fourth term at Cambridge his views had altered, and he went to France to volunteer as a gunner in the French artillery. He was injured during his service with the French Army and was invalided out after the Armistice in November 1918. In 1924 Peniakoff emigrated to Egypt where he worked as an engineer with a sugar manufacturer. During this period of his life he learned to sail, fly and navigate vehicles through the desert, and also become a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Peniakoff was a polyglot who spoke English, Russian, Italian, German, French and Arabic well. World War II Peniakoff was commissioned as a second lieutenant on the British Army General List on 4 October 1940, serving in the Libyan Arab Force. He commanded the unit known as \\"Popski's Private Army\\" in the Middle East and Italy. He was eventually promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the conflict he was awarded the Military Cross on 26 November 1942, and on 26 April 1945 he was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Post-war, in 1947, he was made a Belgian Officier de l'Ordre de la Couronne avec Palme and awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre 1940 avec Palme. Peniakoff became the British-Russian liaison officer in Vienna before demobilisation, naturalisation and achieving fame as a British writer and broadcaster. In 1950 he wrote the book Private Army about his experiences; it sold very well and was reprinted several times that year.  Personal life  In Egypt he married Josephe Louise Colette \\"Josette\\" Ceysens, an Egypt-born Belgian, on 10 November 1928 and had two daughters, Olga and Anne, born in 1930 and 1932. After receiving his commission he divorced Josephe in March 1941 and sent the family to South Africa. On 2 April 1948 he married Pamela Firth in Chelsea. Death Peniakoff died on 15 May 1951 of a brain tumour at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. His body was buried in the graveyard of St. Leonard's Church, Wixoe, in the County of Suffolk, joined in 2005 by his second wife Pamela Firth.

The Brewers Guild has three levels of membership - brewery, allied trade, and enthusiast. All levels are renewed annually. A brewery member can be any company that holds a brewer, microbrewer, or brewpub license issued by the State of Michigan. An allied trade member can be any company commercially involved in the sale, promotion, or distribution of beer, or in the sale, promotion, production, or distribution of goods or services used by the craft beer industry. An enthusiast member can be any person who does not qualify as a brewery member or an allied trade member, but wishes to support the Brewers Guild on a personal level. Enthusiast members receive early entry to the Guild's beer festivals, a T-shirt, invitations to VIP brewery tours, and discounts at member breweries. The website also includes information on beer and food pairing, cooking with food, beer styles and ingredients (including locally sourced hops and barley tied to Michigan's agricultural industry) and beer-cations and brewery tourism options around the state - tied in the Pure Michigan campaign. Regular updates can be found on the Guild's website, . Information regularly includes festival beer and brewery lists, local hotel information, ticket outlets, and press releases regarding member breweries. Information about beer and food pairings, beer styles and ingredients (including locally sourced hops and barley) as well as suggested beer-cations and brewery tourism options are also available online. History The Michigan Brewers Guild was founded by representatives from thirty different Michigan brewing operations December 1997 as an organization dedicated to championing the cause of craft brewed beer in the State of Michigan. There are currently 300+ member breweries in the Michigan Brewers Guild representing over 90% of the brewing licenses in the state. Beer Festivals The Guild hosts four yearly outdoor beer festivals. The Summer Beer Festival, established 1997, is held in the historic Depot Town neighborhood of Ypsilanti the fourth Saturday (and the Friday before) of July. The Winter Beer Festival, established 2006, is held Grand Rapids the fourth Saturday of February. The UP Fall Beer Festival is held in Marquette the Saturday after Labor Day. Finally, the Detroit Fall Beer Festival is held at Eastern Market in Detroit the fourth Saturday of October. Events typically sell out. In 2020, a fifth outdoor beer festival, the Spring Beer Festival, was scheduled for May 16 at Turtle Creek Stadium in Traverse City. It was canceled due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Beginning in 2008, the Brewers Guild set a goal to operate its beer festivals as \\"Zero-Waste\\" events. They work closely with local recycling and composting companies to manage the removal of any plastic, aluminum, paper, and food waste to ensure that as much of it is recycled or composted as possible. Their efforts have resulted in less than 10% of the event waste going to landfill (based on weight). This has been achieved by requiring the use of plates and bowls made from sugarcane, cutlery made from potatoes, and \\"plastic\\" cups made from corn (PLA) - all of which are compostable! There are also bulk water stations instead of bottled water. So if you attend one of the Guild's festivals, do your part by not bringing any products with you that may not be able to be recycled or composted.

Many studies of the human language comprehension process have focused on reading of single utterances (sentences) without context. Extensive research has shown that language comprehension is affected by context preceding a given utterance as well as many other factors. Ambiguity Sentence comprehension has to deal with ambiguity in spoken and written utterances, for example lexical, structural, and semantic ambiguities. Ambiguity is ubiquitous, but people usually resolve it so effortlessly that they do not even notice it. For example, the sentence Time flies like an arrow has (at least) the interpretations Time moves as quickly as an arrow, A special kind of fly, called time fly, likes arrows and Measure the speed of flies like you would measure the speed of an arrow. Usually, readers will be aware of only the first interpretation. Educated readers though, spontaneously think about the arrow of time but inhibit that interpretation because it deviates from the original phrase and the temporal lobe acts as a switch. Instances of ambiguity can be classified as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like Someone shot the servant of the actress who was on the balcony (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or The cop chased the criminal with a fast car (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out. Local ambiguities persist only for a short amount of time as an utterance is heard or written and are resolved during the course of the utterance so the complete utterance has only one interpretation. Examples include sentences like The critic wrote the book was enlightening, which is ambiguous when The critic wrote the book has been encountered, but was enlightening remains to be processed. Then, the sentence could end, stating that the critic is the author of the book, or it could go on to clarify that the critic wrote something about a book. The ambiguity ends at was enlightening, which determines that the second alternative is correct. When readers process a local ambiguity, they settle on one of the possible interpretations immediately without waiting to hear or read more words that might help decide which interpretation is correct (the behaviour is called incremental processing). If readers are surprised by the turn the sentence really takes, processing is slowed and is visible for example in reading times. Locally-ambiguous sentences have, therefore, been used as test cases to investigate the influence of a number of different factors on human sentence processing. If a factor helps readers to avoid difficulty, it is clear that the factor plays a factor in sentence processing. Theories Experimental research has spawned a large number of hypotheses about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Issues like modularity versus interactive processing and serial versus parallel computation of analyses have been theoretical divides in the field. = Architectural issues =  Modular vs. interactive  A modular view of sentence processing assumes that each factor involved in sentence processing is computed in its own module, which has limited means of communication with the other modules. For example, syntactic analysis creation takes place without input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information, which are processed separately. A common assumption of modular accounts is a feed-forward architecture in which the output of one processing step is passed on to the next step without feedback mechanisms that would allow the output of the first module to be corrected. Syntactic processing is usually taken to be the most basic analysis step, which feeds into semantic processing and the inclusion of other information. A separate mental module parses sentences and lexical access happens first. Then, one syntactic hypothesis is considered at a time. There is no initial influence of meaning, or semantic. Sentence processing is supported by a temporo-frontal network. Within the network, temporal regions subserve aspects of identification and frontal regions the building of syntactic and semantic relations. Temporal analyses of brain activation within this network support syntax-first models because they reveal that building of syntactic structure precedes semantic processes and that these interact only during a later stage. Interactive accounts assume that all available information is processed at the same time and can immediately influence the computation of the final analysis. In the interactive model of sentence processing, there is no separate module for parsing. Lexical access, syntactic structure assignment, and meaning assignment happen at the same time in parallel. Several syntactic hypotheses can be considered at a time. The interactive model demonstrates an on-line interaction between the structural and lexical and phonetic levels of sentence processing. Each word, as it is heard in the context of normal discourse, is immediately entered into the processing system at all levels of description, and is simultaneously analyzed at all these levels in the light of whatever information is available at each level at that point in the processing of the sentence. Interactive models of language processing assume that information flows both bottom-up and top-down, so that the representations formed at each level may be influenced by higher as well as lower levels. A framework called the interactive activation framework that embeds this key assumption among others, including the assumption that influences from different sources are combined nonlinearly. The nonlinearity means that information that may be decisive under some circumstances may have little or no effect under other conditions. In the interactive activation framework, the knowledge that guides processing is stored in the connections between units on the same and adjacent levels. The processing units that they connect may receive input from a number of different sources, which allows the knowledge that guides processing to be completely local while, at the same time, allowing the results of processing at one level to influence processing at other levels, both above and below. A basic assumption of the framework is that processing interactions are always reciprocal; it is this bi-directional characteristic that makes the system interactive. Bi-directional excitatory interactions between levels allow mutual simultaneous constraint among adjacent levels, and bi-directional inhibitory interactions within a level allow for competition among mutually incompatible interpretations of a portion of an input. The between-level excitatory interactions are captured in the models in two-way excitatory connections between mutually compatible processing units.(McClelland) Syntactic ambiguities are in fact based at the lexical level. In addition, more recent studies with more sensitive eyetracking machines have shown early context effects. Frequency and contextual information will modulate the activation of alternatives even when they are resolved in favor of the simple interpretation. Structural simplicity is cofounded with frequency, which goes against the garden path theoryMacDonald, Pearlmutter & Seidenberg, 1994).  Serial vs. parallel  Serial accounts assume that humans construct only one of the possible interpretations at first and try another only if the first one turns out to be wrong. Parallel accounts assume the construction of multiple interpretations at the same time. To explain why comprehenders are usually only aware of one possible analysis of what they hear, models can assume that all analyses ranked, and the highest-ranking one is entertained. = Models = There are a number of influential models of human sentence processing that draw on different combinations of architectural choices.  Garden path model  The garden path model is a serial modular parsing model. It proposes that a single parse is constructed by a syntactic module. Contextual and semantic factors influence processing at a later stage and can induce re- analysis of the syntactic parse. Re-analysis is costly and leads to an observable slowdown in reading. When the parser encounters an ambiguity, it is guided by two principles: late closure and minimal attachment. The model has been supported with research on the early left anterior negativity, an event- related potential often elicited as a response to phrase structure violations. Late closure causes new words or phrases to be attached to the current clause. For example, \\"John said he would leave yesterday\\" would be parsed as John said (he would leave yesterday), and not as John said (he would leave) yesterday (i.e., he spoke yesterday). Minimal attachment is a strategy of parsimony: The parser builds the simplest syntactic structure possible (that is, the one with the fewest phrasal nodes).  Constraint-based model  Constraint-based theories of language comprehension emphasize how people make use of the vast amount of probabilistic information available in the linguistic signal. Through statistical learning, the frequencies and distribution of events in linguistic environments can be picked upon, which inform language comprehension. As such, language users are said to arrive at a particular interpretation over another during the comprehension of an ambiguous sentence by rapidly integrating these probabilistic constraints.  Good enough theory  The good enough approach to language comprehension assumes that listeners do not always engage in full detailed processing of linguistic input. Rather, the system has a tendency to develop shallow and superficial representations when confronted with some difficulty. The theory takes an approach that somewhat combines both the garden path model and the constraint based model. The theory focuses on two main issues. The first is that representations formed from complex or difficult material are often shallow and incomplete. The second is that limited information sources are often consulted in cases where the comprehension system encounters difficulty. The theory can be put to test using various experiments in psycholinguistics that involve garden path misinterpretation, etc.\\"Good enough language processing: A satisficing approach Fernanda Ferreira, Paul E. Engelhardt, Manon W. Jones, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Cog Sc Proceedings, 2009\\"Good enough representations in language comprehensions Ferreira, Bailey and Ferraro, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2002 Methods =Behavioral tasks= In behavioral studies, subjects are often presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word (lexical decision), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Speed (often reaction time: time taken to respond to the stimulus) and accuracy (proportion of correct responses) are commonly employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Researchers infer that the nature of the underlying process(es) required by the task gives rise to differences; slower rates and lower accuracy on these tasks are taken as measures of increased difficulty. An important component of any behavioral task is that it stays relatively true to 'normal' language comprehension‚Äîthe ability to generalize the results of any task is restricted when the task has little in common with how people actually encounter language. A common behavioral paradigm involves priming effects, wherein participants are presented first with a prime and then with a target word. The response time for the target word is affected by the relationship between the prime and the target. For example, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. She asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a \\"yes\\" response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a \\"no\\" response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread- stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs, which suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding. =Eye-movements= Eye tracking has been used to study online language processing. This method has been influential in informing knowledge of reading. Additionally, Tanenhaus et al. (1995) established the visual world paradigm, which takes advantage of eye movements to study online spoken language processing. This area of research capitalizes on the linking hypothesis that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention. =Neuroimaging and evoked potentials= The rise of non- invasive techniques provides myriad opportunities for examining the brain bases of language comprehension. Common examples include positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy), and each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in language comprehension. =Computational modeling= Computational modeling is another means by which to explore language comprehension. Models, such as those instantiated in neural networks, are particularly useful because they requires theorists to be explicit in their hypotheses and because they can be used to generate accurate predictions for theoretical models that are so complex that they render discursive analysis unreliable. A classic example of computational modeling in language research is McClelland and Elman's TRACE model of speech perception. A model of sentence processing can be found in Hale (2011)'s 'rational' Generalized Left Corner parser. This model derives garden path effects as well as local coherence phenomena. Computational modeling can also help to relate sentence processing to other functions of language. For example, one model of ERP effects in sentence processing (e.g., N400 and P600) argues that these phenomena arise out learning processes that support language acquisition and linguistic adaptation.

He serves in the Trump administration as the Assistant to the President, Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, and the national Defense Production Act policy coordinator. He previously served as a Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the White House National Trade Council, a newly created entity in the executive branch of the U.S. government, until it was folded into the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, a new role established by executive order in April 2017. He is also a professor emeritus of economics and public policy at the Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, and the author of Death by China, among other publications. Navarro ran unsuccessfully for office in San Diego, California, five times. Navarro's views on trade are significantly outside the mainstream of economic thought, and are widely considered fringe and misguided by other economists. A strong proponent of reducing U.S. trade deficits, Navarro is well known as a critic of Germany and China and has accused both nations of currency manipulation. He has called for increasing the size of the American manufacturing sector, setting high tariffs, and \\"repatriating global supply chains.\\" He is also a vocal opponent of multilateral free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Early life and education Navarro was born on July 15, 1949, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father, Alfred \\"Al\\" Navarro, a saxophonist and clarinetist, led a house band, which played summers in New Hampshire and winters in Florida. After his parents divorced when he was 9 or 10, he lived with his mother, Evelyn Littlejohn, a Saks Fifth Avenue secretary, in Palm Beach, Florida. As a teen, he lived in Bethesda, Maryland in a one-bedroom apartment with his mother and brother. Navarro attended Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. Navarro attended Tufts University on an academic scholarship, graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He defaulted on a federally funded student loan, and was sued in 1979 in Boston Municipal Court by Tufts University trustees for failing to repay the $1,652.83 loan. He then spent three years in the U.S. Peace Corps, serving in Thailand. He earned a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1979, and a PhD in Economics from Harvard under the supervision of Richard E. Caves in 1986.  Career  =Academic career= From 1981 through 1985, he was a research associate at Harvard's Energy and Environmental Policy Center. From 1985 through 1988, he taught at the University of California, San Diego and the University of San Diego. In 1989 he moved to the University of California, Irvine as a professor of economics and public policy. He continued on the UC Irvine faculty for more than 20 years and is now a professor emeritus. He has worked on energy issues and the relationship between the United States and Asia. He has received multiple teaching awards for MBA courses he has taught. As a doctoral student in 1984, Navarro wrote a book entitled The Policy Game: How Special Interests and Ideologues are Stealing America, which discussed that special interest groups had led the United States to \\"a point in its history where it cannot grow and prosper.\\" In the book, he also called for greater worker's compensation to help those who had lost jobs to trade and foreign competition. His doctoral thesis on why corporations donate to charity is one of his most cited works. He has also done research in the topic of wind energy with Frank Harris, a former student of his. =Publications= Navarro has written over a dozen books on various topics in economics and specializing in issues of balance of trade. He has published peer-reviewed economics research on energy policy, charity, deregulation and the economics of trash collection. Navarro \\"is a prolific writer, but has no publications in top-tier academic journals... [although] his research interests are broader than the average economist‚Äôs.\\" The Coming China Wars is a book published by FT Press in (2006). Navarro examines China as an emerging world power confronting challenges at home and abroad as it struggles to exert itself in the global market. He also discusses how China's role in international commerce is creating conflicts with nations around the world over energy, natural resources, the environment, intellectual property, and other issues. A review in Publishers Weekly describes the book as \\"comprehensive\\" and \\"contemporary\\" and concludes that it \\"will teach readers to understand the dragon, just not how to vanquish it\\". Navarro discusses his work, Death by China, arguing China cheats in the world trade system at University of Michigan in 2012 Death by China (2011) is a book by Navarro and Greg Autry. According to The Economist, \\"the core allegations Mr. Navarro makes against China are not all that controversial. He accuses China of keeping its currency cheap ... He deplores China‚Äôs practice of forcing American firms to hand over intellectual property as a condition of access to its market. He notes, correctly, that Chinese firms pollute the environment more freely and employ workers in far worse conditions than American rules allow.\\" Navarro argues that China violates fair trade by \\"illegal export subsidies and currency manipulation, effectively flooding the U.S. markets\\" and unfairly making it \\"virtually impossible\\" for American companies to compete. It is a critique of \\"global capitalism\\", including foreign labor practices and environmental protection. Currency manipulation and subsidies are stated as reasons that \\"American companies cannot compete because they're not competing with Chinese companies, they're competing with the Chinese government.\\" In 2012, Navarro directed and produced a documentary film based on his book, Death by China. The film, described as \\"fervently anti-China\\", was released under the same title and narrated by Martin Sheen. From 2011 until 2016, Navarro was a frequent guest on the radio program The John Batchelor Show. =Political career= Campaigns for public office While teaching at UC Irvine, Navarro ran unsuccessfully for office in San Diego, California, five times. In 1992, he ran for mayor, finishing first (38.2%) in the primary, but lost with 48% to Susan Golding in the runoff. During his mayoral campaign, Navarro ran on a no-growth platform. He paid $4,000 in fines and court costs for violating city and state election laws. In 1993, he ran for San Diego city council, and in 1994 for San Diego County board of supervisors, losing each time. In 1996, he ran for the 49th Congressional District as the Democratic Party nominee, touting himself as an environmental activist, but lost to Republican Brian Bilbray, 52.7% to 41.9%. In 2001, Navarro ran in a special election to fill the District 6 San Diego city council seat, but lost in a special election with 7.85% of the vote. Veteran political consultant Larry Remer, who ran two of Navarro‚Äôs campaigns, describes him as \\"the biggest asshole I‚Äôve ever known.\\" Political positions Navarro‚Äôs political affiliations and policy positions have been described as \\"hotly disputed and across the spectrum.\\" While he lived in Massachusetts studying for his PhD at Harvard, he was a registered Democrat. When he moved to California in 1986, he was initially registered as nonpartisan, and became a registered Republican in 1989. By 1991, he had again re-registered as an Independent, and carried that affiliation during the 1992 San Diego mayoral election. Around this time, he still considered himself a conservative Republican. Navarro rejoined the Democratic Party in 1994 and remained a Democrat during each of his subsequent political campaigns. In 1996, while he was running for Congress, Navarro was endorsed by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton and spoke at the 1996 Democratic Convention, saying, \\"I'm proud to be carrying the Clinton-Gore banner.\\" He positioned himself as a \\"strong environmentalist and a progressive on social issues such as choice, gay rights, and religious freedom.\\" Navarro supported Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Presidential campaign in 2008. Navarro supported President Barack Obama's phase-out of incandescent light bulbs, the adoption of wind energy, and carbon taxes in order to stop global warming. During the 2016 Presidential election, Navarro described himself as \\"a Reagan Democrat and a Trump Democrat abandoned by my party.\\" Despite this, Navarro was critical of Ronald Reagan‚Äôs defense spending, called GDP growth during the administration a \\"Failure of Reaganomics\\" and described the \\"10-5-3\\" tax proposal as \\"a very large corporate subsidy.\\" During the early stage of the Trump administration, Navarro was still known to be a Democrat, but by February 2018 he had again re-registered as a Republican.  Trump campaign advisor  In 2016, Navarro served as an economic policy adviser to Donald Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign. He advocated for an isolationist and protectionist American foreign policy. Navarro and the international private equity investor Wilbur Ross authored an economic plan for the Trump campaign in September 2016. Navarro was invited to be an adviser after Trump‚Äôs advisor and son-in- law Jared Kushner saw on Amazon that he co-wrote Death by China. When told that the Tax Policy Center assessment of Trump's economic plan said it would reduce federal revenues by $6 trillion and reduce economic growth in the long term, Navarro said that the analysis demonstrated \\"a high degree of analytical and political malfeasance\\". When the Peterson Institute for International Affairs estimated that Trump's economic plan would cost millions of Americans their jobs, Navarro said that writers at the Peterson Institute \\"weave a false narrative and they come up with some phony numbers.\\" According to MIT economist Simon Johnson, the economic plan essay authored by Navarro and Ross for Trump during the campaign had projections \\"based on assumptions so unrealistic that they seem to have come from a different planet. If the United States really did adopt Trump's plan, the result would be an immediate and unmitigated disaster.\\" When 370 economists, including 19 Nobel laureates, signed a letter warning against Trump's stated economic policies in November 2016, Navarro said that the letter was \\"an embarrassment to the corporate offshoring wing of the economist profession who continues to insist bad trade deals are good for America.\\" In October 2016, along with Wilbur Ross and Andy Puzder, Navarro co-authored an essay titled \\"Economic Analysis of Donald Trump's Contract with the American Voter\\".Wilbur Ross, Andy Puzder & Peter Navarro, , Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., October 30, 2016 White House trade advisor Director Peter Navarro addresses President Donald Trump's promises to American people, workers, and domestic manufacturers (Declaring American Economic Independence on June 28, 2016) in the Oval Office with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross before President Trump signs Executive Orders regarding trade in March 2017Presidential Executive Order Regarding the Omnibus Report on Significant Trade Deficits , White House, March 31, 2016Presidential Executive Order on Establishing Enhanced Collection and Enforcement of Antidumping and Countervailing Duties and Violations of Trade and Customs Laws , White House, March 31, 2016 On December 21, 2016, Navarro was selected by President-elect Trump to head a newly created position, as director of the White House National Trade Council. He outlines Trump's trade policy as aiming to create jobs, revive the manufacturing sector, and improve the country's trade balance. He warned that trade deficits could jeopardize U.S. national security by allowing unfriendly nations to encroach on American supply chains. One of his main missions is to focus on behaviors by other countries that he considers abusive, cheating, illegal, and unfair against the U.S. Director of Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy In April 2017, the National Trade Council became part of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, of which Navarro was appointed Director. By September 2017, the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy had been folded into the National Economic Council, which meant that Navarro would report to NEC Director Gary Cohn. In February 2018, several media outlets reported that Navarro's influence in the administration was rising again and that he would likely be promoted from the secondary billet of Deputy Assistant to the President to Assistant to the President, giving Navarro parity with the NEC Director. Josh Rogin, writing for The Washington Post, reported that Navarro had used his prior time of lower influence to lead several low-profile policy items, such as working to increase military funding, drafting Executive Order 13806, and leading the effort to solve a dispute between the United States and Qatar over the Open Skies Agreement between the two countries. In explaining his role in the Trump administration, Navarro said that he is there to \\"provide the underlying analytics that confirm [Trump's] intuition [on trade]. And his intuition is always right in these matters.\\" In June 2018, Navarro said that there was \\"a special place in hell\\" for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, after Trudeau said that Canada would respond to U.S. tariffs against Canada with retaliatory tariffs. Trudeau‚Äôs remarks and Canada's response to these tariffs were already public and well-known when Navarro made this comment. Navarro later apologized. In May 2019, Navarro said that Trump's decision to place tariffs on Mexico unless Mexico stopped illegal immigration to the United States as \\"a brilliant move\\". In September 2019, after Trump tasked him with combatting China's usage of international mail rates to more cheaply ship products into the US, Navarro successfully led a diplomatic effort to the third Extraordinary Congress of the Universal Postal Union, where it agreed member countries could opt-in to self-declare their rates starting in July 2020. This agreement arose following repeated threats from the Trump administration to leave the UPU unless global postage rates were changed; at the summit, Navarro claimed that countries like China were unfairly benefitting from international delivery prices, particularly when it came to e-commerce deliveries. Navarro continued to promote policies challenging amid trade negotiations between the two countries. Navarro worked with the DHS to initiate a crackdown on counterfeited and pirated e-commerce goods from overseas, and he promoted the administration's actions on the matter. Trump signed an executive order on the matter on January 31, 2020. In February 2020, it was reported that Navarro was conducting his own investigation into the identity of the author of an anonymous op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the Trump Administration. Infrastructure plan During the campaign Navarro, together with Wilbur Ross, who became Trump's Commerce Secretary, designed a $1 trillion infrastructure development plan for Trump's presidential campaign. The plan called for $137 billion in tax credits to private business to induce them to financing the bulk of infrastructure spending. Economists across the political spectrum derided the proposal. Trump released a $1.5 trillion version of this plan in February 2018 but the Republican-controlled Congress showed little enthusiasm for the proposal, with The Hill reporting, \\"President Trump's infrastructure plan appears to have crashed and burned in Congress\\". Coronavirus pandemic On January 29, 2020, Navarro issued a memo warning that novel coronavirus could \\"evolv[e] into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans\\" and that the \\"risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked\\". He argued for restrictions on travel from China. Navarro wrote another memo on February 23, 2020, arguing that the disease \\"could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls\\" and calling for an \\"immediate supplemental appropriation of at least $3 billion.\\" At the same time that Navarro issued these warnings, he publicly stated that the American people had \\"nothing to worry about\\" regarding the coronavirus. On March 27, 2020, Trump appointed Navarro to coordinate the federal government's Defense Production Act policy response during the coronavirus pandemic. In this position, Navarro promoted domestic production of coronavirus-related supplies in addition to a general nationalist agenda. Navarro clashed with Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, over whether the administration should promote the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus, even though the drug's effectiveness was unproven. In July 2020, Navarro touted a widely criticized study as showing that hydroxychloroquine was an effective coronavirus treatment; public health experts pointed to limitations with the study and to the fact that multiple randomized controlled trials failed to conclude that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment. Navarro advocated for reducing U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains, stating that \\"never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures.\\" Among other statements, he accused China of \\"profiteering\\" from the coronavirus and warned of economic disruptions resulting from the virus. In May 2020, Navarro criticized stay-at-home orders, arguing that the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns will kill \\"many more\\" people than the coronavirus. In August 2020, administration officials terminated a contract that Navarro had directly negotiated for the purchase of 42,900 ventilators for use in the pandemic. A US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spokesperson said the cancellation was \\"subject to internal HHS investigation and legal review\\", as an oversight subcommittee of the US House of Representatives concluded that the government had overpaid for the ventilators by US $500 million.  Views on trade  Navarro has been a staunch critic of trade with China and strong proponent of reducing U.S. trade deficits. He has attacked Germany, Japan and China for currency manipulation. He has called for increasing the size of the American manufacturing sector, setting high tariffs, and repatriating global supply chains. He was a fierce opponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. According to Bloomberg News, Navarro had \\"roots as a mainstream economist\\" as he voiced support for free trade in his 1984 book The Policy Game. He changed his positions as he saw \\"the globalist erosion of the American economy\\" develop. According to Politico, Navarro's economic theories are \\"considered fringe\\" by his fellow economists. A New Yorker reporter described Navarro's views on trade and China as so radical \\"that, even with his assistance, I was unable to find another economist who fully agrees with them.\\" The Economist described Navarro as having \\"oddball views\\". The George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen has described Navarro as \\"one of the most versatile and productive American economists of the last few decades\\", but Cowen noted that he disagreed with his views on trade, which he claimed go \\"against a strong professional consensus.\\" University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers described Navarro's views as \\"far outside the mainstream,\\" noting that \\"he endorses few of the key tenets of\\" the economics profession. According to Lee Branstetter, economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and trade expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Navarro \\"was never a part of the group of economists who ever studied the global free-trade system ... He doesn't publish in journals. What he's writing and saying right now has nothing to do with what he got his Harvard Ph.D. in ... he doesn't do research that would meet the scientific standards of that community.\\" Marcus Noland, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, described a tax and trade paper written by Navarro and Wilbur Ross for Trump as \\"a complete misunderstanding of international trade, on their part.\\" In August 2019, Navarro asserted the tariffs of the ongoing China‚ÄìUnited States trade war were not hurting Americans. Citing extensive evidence to the contrary, Politifact rated Navarro's assertion \\"Pants on Fire.\\" = Border adjustment tax = Navarro supports a tax policy called \\"border adjustment\\", which, as commonly used in the VATs of most countries, taxes all imports at the domestic rate while rebating tax on exports, essentially transforming taxes from taxes on production to taxes on consumption. In response to criticism that the border adjustment tax could hurt U.S. companies and put jobs at risk, Navarro called it \\"fake news\\". = Criticism of China = According to Politico, \\"Navarro is perhaps the most extreme advocate in Washington, and maybe in all of economics, for an aggressive stance toward China.\\" Navarro put his attention to China in the mid-2000s. His first publication on the subject is the 2006 book The Coming China Wars: Where They Will Be Fought, How They Can Be Won. Navarro has said that he started to examine China when he noticed that his former students were losing jobs, concluding that China was at fault. In Politicos description of the book, \\"Navarro uses military language to refer to China's trade policies, referring to its 'conquest' of the world's export markets, which has 'vaporized literally millions of manufacturing jobs and driven down wages.' ... China's aspirations are so insatiable, he claims, that eventually there will be a clash over \\"our most basic of all needs‚Äîbread, water, and air.'\\" Navarro has described the entry of China to the World Trade Organization as one of the United States' biggest mistakes. To respond to the Chinese threat, Navarro has advocated for 43% tariffs, the repudiation of trade pacts, major increases in military expenditures and strengthened military ties with Taiwan. The New York Times notes that \\"a wide range of economists have warned that curtailing trade with China would damage the American economy, forcing consumers to pay higher prices for goods and services.\\" Navarro has reportedly also encouraged Trump to enact a 25% tariff on Chinese steel imports, something that \\"trade experts worry... would upend global trade practices and cause countries to retaliate, potentially leading to a trade war\\". Navarro has said that a large part of China's competitive advantage over the United States stems from unfair trade practices. Navarro has criticized China for pollution, poor labor standards, government subsidies, producing \\"contaminated, defective and cancerous\\" exports, currency manipulation, and theft of US intellectual property. In his 2012 documentary, Navarro said that China caused the loss of 57,000 US factories and 25 million jobs. Navarro has maintained that China manipulates its currency and, on August 5, 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department officially designated China as a \\"currency manipulator.\\" Of the more than dozen China specialists contacted by Foreign Policy, most either did not know of Navarro or had only interacted with him briefly. Kenneth Pomeranz, University of Chicago professor of Chinese History, said that his \\"recollection is that [Navarro] generally avoided people who actually knew something about the country.\\" Columnist Gordon G. Chang was the only China watcher contacted by Foreign Policy who defended Navarro, but even he noted that he disagreed with Navarro's claims of currency manipulation, opposition to the TPP, and calls for high tariffs. James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said that Navarro's books and documentary on China \\"have close to zero credibility with people who know the country,\\" and are filled with \\"hyperbole, inaccuracies\\" and a \\"cartoonish caricature of China that he puts out.\\" Some of Navarro's views on China fit within the mainstream, such as criticism of Chinese currency manipulation (pre-2015), concern that China‚Äôs rapid ascension to the World Trade Organization harmed the Rust Belt, and criticism of China's weak environmental regulations and poor labor standards. = Ron Vara = In six of his books about China, Navarro quotes a \\"Ron Vara\\", whom he describes as a China hawk and former Harvard PhD doctoral student in economics, and who says Sinophobic things about China and the Chinese. An investigation by the Chronicle of Higher Education found that no such person existed, and that Ron Vara (an anagram of Navarro) appeared to represent views that Navarro himself held. Navarro has admitted to making up the character, an author surrogate, and quoting him in his books. Economist Glenn Hubbard, who co-authored Seeds of Destruction with Navarro, has said he was not aware that Vara was fictional, and that he did not approve of Navarro attributing information to a fictional source. In December 2019, a memo apparently authored by Ron Vara began circulating in Washington DC. The memo highlighted the \\"Keep Tariff Argument\\" and the use of tariffs against China a few days before an additional 15% tariff on $160 billion of Chinese made goods was set to be implemented. Navarro later confirmed that he had written the memo. = Germany = Navarro drew controversy when he accused Germany of using a \\"grossly undervalued\\" euro to \\"exploit\\" the US and the rest of the European Union. Politico noted that the German government does not set the value of the euro. Economists and commentators are divided on the accuracy of Navarro's remarks. Economist Paul Krugman said that Navarro was right and wrong at the same time: \\"Yes, Germany in effect has an undervalued currency relative to what it would have without the euro... But does this mean that the euro as a whole is undervalued against the dollar? Probably not.\\" Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff described Navarro's accusation of Germany as a currency manipulator as \\"#stupideconomics\\". = Manufacturing = Navarro argues that the decline in US manufacturing jobs is chiefly due to \\"unfair trade practices and bad trade deals. And if you don't believe that, just go to the booming factories in Germany, in Japan, in Korea, in China, in Malaysia, in Vietnam, in Indonesia, in Italy‚Äîevery place that we're running deficits with.\\" However, many economists attribute the decline in manufacturing jobs chiefly to automation and other innovations that allow manufacturing firms to produce more goods with fewer workers, rather than trade. Navarro has been a proponent of strengthening the manufacturing sector's role in the national economy: \\"We envision a more Germany-style economy, where 20 percent of our workforce is in manufacturing. ... And we're not talking about banging tin in the back room.\\" The New York Times notes that \\"experts on manufacturing ... doubt that the government can significantly increase factory employment, noting that mechanization is the major reason fewer people are working in factories.\\" = Opposition to NAFTA = Navarro has called for the United States to leave the North American Free Trade Agreement, and has tried to convince Trump to initiate a withdrawal. = Repatriation of global supply chains = Navarro has called for repatriating global supply chains. According to Politico's Jacob Heilbrunn, such a move \\"would be enormously costly and take years to execute\\". = Trade as a national security risk = Navarro has framed trade as a national security risk. Navarro has characterized foreign purchases of U.S. companies as a threat to national security, but according to NPR, this is \\"a fringe view that puts him at odds with the vast majority of economists.\\" Dartmouth economist Douglas Irwin noted that the US government already reviews foreign purchases of companies with military or strategic value, and has on occasion rejected such deals. Irwin said that Navarro had not substantiated his claim with any evidence. Navarro has also said that the United States has \\"already begun to lose control of [its] food supply chain\\", which according to NPR, \\"sounded pretty off-the-wall to a number of economists\\" who noted that the US is a massive exporter of food. Dermot Hayes, an agribusiness economist at Iowa State University, described Navarro's statement as \\"uninformed\\". Navarro criticized the outsourcing of critical materials ‚Äî like the production of essential medical supplies ‚Äî to China. = Trade deficits = Navarro is a proponent of the notion that trade deficits are bad in and of themselves, a view which is widely rejected by trade experts and economists. In a white paper co-authored with Wilbur Ross, Navarro stated, \\"when a country runs a trade deficit by importing more than it exports, this subtracts from growth.\\" In a Wall Street Journal op-ed defending his views, Navarro stated, \\"If we are able to reduce our trade deficits through tough, smart negotiations, we should be able to increase our growth.\\" Harvard University economics professor Gregory Mankiw has said that Navarro's views on the trade deficit are based on the kind of mistakes that \\"even a freshman at the end of ec 10 knows.\\" Tufts University professor Daniel W. Drezner said about Navarro's op-ed, \\"as someone who's written on this topic I could not for the life of me understand his reasoning\\". According to Tyler Cowen, \\"close to no one\\" in the economics profession agrees with Navarro's idea that a trade deficit is bad in and of itself. Nobel laureate Angus Deaton described Navarro's attitude on trade deficits as \\"an old-fashioned mercantilist position.\\" The Economist has described Navarro's views on the trade deficit as \\"dodgy economics\\", while the Financial Times has described them as \\"poor economics\\". Economists Noah Smith, Scott Sumner, Olivier Blanchard, and Phil Levy have also criticized Navarro's views on the trade deficit. Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, goes so far as to call Navarro a \\"charlatan\\" and says that \\"99.9 per cent of respectable economists would eschew\\" what he says: \\"He says imports deduct from output, and he calls that accounting identity the 'economic growth formula'. He thinks that for every dollar we import, our GDP is reduced by a dollar. I don't know how he got his PhD at Harvard.\\" = Opposition to Trans- Pacific Partnership = Navarro opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In an April 2015 op-ed, Navarro said, \\"To woo us, their spinmeisters boast the TPP will spur American exports to stimulate sorely needed economic growth. In truth, the American economy will suffer severely. This is because the TPP will hammer two main drivers of economic growth‚Äîdomestic investment and 'net exports.'\\" Navarro said in March 2017 that TPP \\"would have been a \\"death knell\\" to America's auto and vehicle parts industry that we \\"urgently need to bring back to full life.\\" Politico's Jacob Heilbrunn and the Economist argue that there may be a disconnect between Navarro's policy on China and his opposition to the TPP, as scuttling the TPP will strengthen China's hand.  Personal life  In 2001 Navarro married Leslie Lebon, a California architect. The couple lived in Laguna Beach with Lebon's son from a previous marriage while Navarro was a professor at UC Irvine. In late 2018, Lebon filed for divorce in Orange County.

As with the previous year in the rugby union 1972 Five Nations Championship, threats were made by Republican activists against visiting British teams, which in this year meant England and Wales. To prevent violence but keep the tournament running, Northern Ireland's \\"home\\" games were transferred to Goodison Park, the home of Everton F.C. in Liverpool in England. This step meant that Ireland played just a short ferry ride from Belfast (where the match was originally scheduled) in a city with a substantial Irish population, but where the police were able to exercise a greater measure of control over who was able to attend. The shift to England did not substantially hinder the Irish, who claimed a rare and respectable second place behind England, who achieved yet another whitewash of their near neighbours. Beating the Irish in Liverpool to match Scotland's win over Wales, England then inflicted defeat on the same team at Wembley, whilst the Irish recovered from their first game to beat the Scots in Scotland. In the final two games, Northern Ireland beat Wales, setting up a close encounter in the final game, in which the winner would take the tournament but a draw would benefit the Irish. The game was a close encounter, made more interesting by an English 5‚Äì0 thrashing of Scotland two months earlier in a testimonial match celebrating one hundred years of international football.

It aired on KBS2 from November 13, 2006 to January 8, 2007 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes. Synopsis The drama starts with Han Tae-woong (Hyun Bin), a quiet, 17 year old math genius, entering a prestigious high school. There he meets Kim Jung-kyu, also a genius in mathematics. The two immediately develop rivalry and tension, but later become best friends. Through their conversations, we learn that Jung-kyu is a big boxing enthusiast. Meanwhile, Tae-woong stumbles upon a little girl being bullied in the street and saves her. The girl develops a crush on him and gives him her pager so that she can see him again, but they never exchange names or contacts. They promise to meet again soon, but this never happens. In a highly anticipated International Math Olympiad, Jung-kyu fails to fulfill his father's expectations to win the gold medal, and commits suicide in shame. Tae-woong, who wins the gold medal instead, struggles from guilt, as he feels like he is partly responsible for Jung-kyu's death. From guilt, Tae-woong quits school, leaves home, and disappears. Eight years later, Tae-woong, now 25, is a nameless boxer, living a completely different life. He abandoned his mother, dropped out of school, left mathematics, and pursued boxing in honor of Jung-kyu, but he still bears painful memories of his past. He then meets Bo-ra (Sung Yu-ri), a beautiful, but cold-hearted young woman. She is the daughter of a rich businessman, but has an incurable disease. After a chain of events, Tae-woong is hired as her chauffeur. They end up falling in love, but Tae-woong discovers that she was the little girl that he met eight years earlier, and that she is Jung-kyu's little sister. Throughout the story the two learn to find true happiness by helping each other. Tae-woong melts Bo- ra's heart with love and helps her open up her heart. In return Bo-ra helps Tae-woong with his painful memories of the past.

Adenite culture became distinct from other Yemenite Jewish culture due to British control of the city and Indian-Iraqi influence as well as recent arrivals from Persia and Egypt. Although they were separated, Adeni Jews depended on the greater Yemenite community for spiritual guidance, receiving their authorizations from Yemeni rabbis. Virtually the entire population emigrated from Aden between June 1947 and September 1967. As of 2004, there were 6,000 Adenites in Israel, and 1,500 in London. History =Early history= In 1489, Rabbi Obadiah di Bertinora encountered Jews in Jerusalem who had come from Aden, and who described for him their polity and settlement in the land of Yemen, as also knowledge about Moses' progeny who were settled some fifty-days' walking distance from their place as one journeys in the desert, and that they were encompassed by the river Sambation. He says that the Jews of Aden were only knowledgeable in the writings of Rabbi Alfasi and Maimonides, in the latter work of which they were especially well- versed.Avraham Yari, Igros Eretz Yisroel (Letters of the Land of Israel), in the \\"Letter of Rabbi Obadiah di Bertinora from Jerusalem to his Brother,\\" written in 1489, Tel-Aviv 1943, p. 140 (in PDF); See also Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah, Venice 1585 (Hebrew), who testified in the name of Rabbi Obadiah di Bertinoro who had said that there came Jews in his days to Jerusalem, who had come from the southeastern hemisphere, along the sea of the [Indian] ocean, and who declared that they had no other book beside the Yad, belonging to Maimonides. Rabbi Yihya Saleh, speaking more distinctly about this episode, writes in his Questions & Responsa (Pe‚Äôulath Sadiq, vol. ii, responsum 180) that he was referring there to the Jews of Yemen who had made a pilgrimage to the Land of Israel at that time. The Cairo Genizah (discovered in 1896) contains amazing letters from an earlier period of the sages which reveal connections between the Jewish communities of Egypt and Aden, and trade to India via Aden.S.D. Goitein & M.A. Friedman, India Traders of the Middle Ages: Documents from the Cairo Geniza ('India Book'). The Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem & Brill, Leiden-Boston. xxix+918 pp. Bibliography, Indexes, 15 plates and 3 maps. Some of the letters were sent by the heads of rabbinical academies to the Adeni and other communities seeking financial support for their institutions. Digs at Beit She'arim in Israel provide proof that Jews were settled in Aden, Yemen during the mishnaic period (2nd and 3rd centuries CE). A hall was discovered there containing tombs of the Jews from Yemen. These Jews had been brought from Himyar for burial in the holy land. Tombstones were also found in Jewish cemeteries in Aden, dating as far back as the 12th century. Epitaph of Ahron, son of Yeshua, from the year 32 of the Contracts calendar In the 10th century relations between the Jews of Yemen-Aden and of Babylonia became closer as evidenced by the adoption of upper pointing by the former, (sometimes called Babylonian pointing, in which the vocal marks are placed above instead of below the line as is the case today.) Although this did not last long, they retained this practice even after books began to be printed. Adeni Jewry possessed Saadia Gaon's translations into Arabic of the Torah and the five megilloth. The prayers and liturgies composed by the Babylonian sages, such as the \\"Hosha'not\\" for Sukkoth, which is contained in Saadia Gaon's prayer book, were adopted by the Aden Jews and have been retained by them ever since. In one of the Cairo documents there appear instructions from Madmon Ben Yafter Ben Bendar, the ruler of Yemen and himself from Aden, to Halfon Ben Nethaniel Halevi from Fustat in Egypt, which indicates that already in the 10th century there was a small Jewish settlement in Aden. From 1083‚Äì1173 Aden was ruled by an Arab dynasty called the Zura'ites. From this time onwards Aden served as an important community centre and became crucial as a port from the commercial sea lanes between the Mediterranean sea, India and further into the far east. The Jews became heavily involved in international trade and as a result they were able to support generously the yeshivoth of Babylonia, Egypt and the Land of Israel. From the 10th to the 13th centuries, Aden was the centre of Yemeni Jewish life. The \\"Yemeni governors\\" or the \\"ministers of the communities\\" sat in Aden and from there led the entire community, including Abu Ali Hasan in the late 11th century. Their influence spread as far as Persia and Babylonia and throughout the Arabian Peninsula as far as the Hijaz in the north and Hadramout in the east. = Under the British Protectorate = The British Empire began to expand into the Middle East during the mid-19th century, and the Jews of Aden fared considerably better under the Aden Protectorate than under Muslim rule, which attracted Jewish immigrants from the rest of Yemen. After 1838, there were roughly 5,000 Jews in the city of Aden itself, and some 2,000 in the rest of what would become the Aden protectorate. In 1911, the Jewish community in Aden was visited by Zionist emissary Shemuel Yavne'eli who, equipped with 26 questions drafted by the chief rabbi of Ottoman Palestine, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, posed these questions to the leaders of the community. Yavne'eli's papers (including the responsa) are now preserved at the Central Zionist Archives (CZA) in Jerusalem.Central Zionist Archives, Yavne'eli Collection - A237/19, \\"Responsa of the Bet-din of Aden\\". Adenite Diaspora Jews from Aden established communities in Eritrea and Ethiopia. In 1935, sixty percent of Asmara's Jews were Adeni, while twenty percent were Yemeni. Shoa Menahem Joseph, an Adeni Jew, was a leader of the Eritrean Jewish community from 1927 until his death in 1966. Although the Adenim depended on them for religion, many Adenites wished to distance themselves from Yemeni Jews, worrying that associating with them would harm their status in Italian Eritrea's racial hierarchy. As Adeni Jews were British subjects, they were considered members of the colonial group, while Yemeni Jews were considered indigenous subjects. Attempts were made by Jewish leaders to equalize rights for all Eritrean Jews, however they were rejected by Italian authorities. A Yemeni Jew from Sana'a named Hubbara reported that when he first got to Asmara, a local Adeni refused to walk beside him as he did not want to seem too friendly with an indigenous black person. Hubbara elaborates: : The Italians divided people into two groups: whites and blacks. The Europeans were white and the Abyssinians and other Africans were black. As for the Jews, those who dressed in European fashion were considered white, while those dressed in oriental clothing would be despised and humiliated just like the blacks. Addis Ababa at one point had a prominent Adenite community. Most of them left fairly quickly, however some stayed and established synagogues and Hebrew schools. In 1986, there were six Adeni families left in the city, and almost all of their property was seized by the Mengistu regime. Synagogues of Aden Grand synagogue of Aden Before the last World War there were seven synagogues in Aden, and the Jewish population numbered several thousand. In 1858 the Grand synagogue of Aden called the \\"Shield of Avraham\\" or \\"al- Milama'l-kabira\\" was built. It was large enough to house over 2000 worshippers. A yeshiva called \\"Torah ve Hamitzvah\\" was also built next to the synagogue. The \\"Shulchan Aruch\\", Zohar, \\"Tikkun Hatzot\\", psalms, \\"the law of Israel\\" and \\"Ein Ya'akov\\" (composed by Ya'akov Havib) was studied at the yeshiva. While the great synagogue was the hub of the Jewish community, several smaller synagogues also existed. Most notable among these were the al- Farhi synagogue, which house the highly venerated Al-Farhi Torah scroll and the synagogue of \\"Shemuel Nissim\\" which served as the Talmud Torah for boys until the early 1940s. Another Synagogue was referred to as \\"Mi'lamat Hanokh\\". It was established in Aden by a man named Moshe Hanokh Halevi. He had emigrated to Aden and made his livelihood by the importation of sacred books from Europe. On the eve of rosh Hashanah in 1924 a new synagogue named \\"Sukkat Shalom\\", popularly known as \\"Mialamat Silim\\", was inaugurated and celebrations continued into the night.  Anti-Jewish riots in Aden  In May 1932, a riot began when Muslims accused Jews of throwing excrement into a mosque courtyard. Sixty persons, including 25 Jews, were injured but there were no fatalities.Secretary of State for India, House of Commons debates of May 30, 1932 and June 1, 1932. However, says there was one fatality. The Farhi synagogue was desecrated. Much more serious events occurred in December 1947, in the wake of the United Nations' approval of the Partition Plan for Palestine. On 2 December, a three-day strike was called to protest the decision. Demonstrations led to stone and bottle throwing between Jews and Muslims in the Jewish quarter of Aden. Jewish houses and shops were looted, and military control was declared when the crisis exceeded the capacity of the small police force. The main military force available was the 1,800 strong Aden Protectorate Levies who were locally recruited soldiers with British and Arab officers. Assistance was also received from several British warships, which sent landing parties, and the equivalent of two companies of British infantry flown in from the Canal Zone. Order was not restored until 6 December. The main violence occurred in three locations. In Aden town (also called Crater), an attempt to impose a curfew was largely unsuccessful. Jewish schools and houses were looted and set alight. On the second day rifle fire began. The Levies proved unreliable and worse; some fired indiscriminately and probably contributed to the casualties. In the port towns of Steamer Point and Tawahi, most of the Jews were evacuated but some whose presence was not known to the police were killed. Several Arabs who were apparently innocent were shot accidentally. In the Arab town of Sheikh Othman, which had a large Jewish compound, a military contingent arrived to evacuate the 750 Jews to safety. However, several declined to leave and were later found dead. The official casualty count was 76‚Äì82 Jews (6 persons were unidentified) and 38 Arabs killed, and 76 Jews wounded. At least 87 Arabs were known to have been wounded but many others failed to report their condition. The dead included one Indian Medical Officer and one Levy. More than 100 Jewish shops were looted and 30 houses burned. An official enquiry conducted by Sir Harry Trusted determined that many individual Levies were sympathetic to the rioters and did not act to control them. Nine Levies were imprisoned for looting. Trusted put most of the blame on Yemeni \\"coolies\\", workers temporarily in the country who \\"have a low standard of life, are illiterate, fanatical and, when excited, may be savage.\\" He did not find claims of Jewish sniping to be convincing, though the Governor Sir Reginald Champion secretly reported to the British government that the two military fatalities were killed \\"almost certainly by Jewish sniper\\". Jewish leaders acknowledged \\"many instances of Arabs and Indians sheltering and otherwise befriending their Jewish neighbours.\\" The British government was severely embarrassed by the riots, noting privately that they were urging the Arab states to protect their Jews when they themselves were unable to. Remnants of Jewish community destroyed In March 2020, it was reported that the Jewish cemetery in Aden was destroyed.See . Writings There never was a Hebrew printing press in Yemen, with the exception of Aden, and all the thousands of holy books used by the Jews there were handwritten. Manuscript page from Adeni Midrash ha-Gadol. The main Adeni synagogue in London was given the same name as the book Nahalat Yosef (1906). This book was written by Rabbi Shmuel Ben Yosef, grandson of the third dayan of the Aden rabbinical court Mori Yeshu'ah. This book covers all the religious practices of the Aden Jewish Community since the conclusions of the Jerusalem Talmud in the 5th century CE. Midrash ha-Gadol written by David bar Amram al-Adani in the 13th century is a compilation of aggadic midrashim on the Pentateuch taken from the two Talmuds and earlier Midrashim. In addition, it borrows quotations from the Targums and Kabbalistic writings, and in this aspect is unique among the various midrashic collections.

Its origins and history are much less well documented than those of many other \\"big box\\" illusions but some sources indicate it might be one of the earliest examples of that type of trick. References and picture captions indicate it was the creation of British magician and designer Val Walker. Description The magician recruits several volunteers from the audience. A female assistant is then introduced and one or more of the volunteers are invited to help her into a series of restraints, which consist of leather straps with short chains or cords attached. Four short straps are fitted as cuffs around her wrists and ankles, a slightly longer one as a collar around her neck and an even larger one as belt around her waist. As the first group of volunteers complete the fastening of the restraints to the assistant the magician presents a cabinet and invites the remaining volunteers to inspect it. The cabinet is just large enough to accommodate a person in a standing position and it is initially open at the front and back. A panel, with a series of slots and holes in, is presented and fitted to the back of the cabinet. The assistant, now fitted out with the straps and chains, steps into the cabinet. The chains are passed through holes in the side of the cabinet and secured to fixings on the outside. This leaves the assistant apparently held in a standing posture inside the cabinet, with her arms at her sides and with little leeway for movement. A second panel, similar to the first, is presented and fitted to the front of the cabinet. This second panel has a stylised silhouette of a female figure painted on it, which indicates the approximate position of the assistant who is now hidden inside. The magician then pushes a series of rods through holes in the front panel (these are shown to have emerged through matching holes in the rear panel). The first rods apparently serve to further prevent any movement by the assistant and later ones look as if they must actually be pushed through her body. In addition a series of blades are pushed through slots in the front panel so that it appears the cabinet is divided into sections, each of which is too small for the assistant. Finally, a large square-sectioned tube is pushed through the middle of the cabinet from front to back. It is demonstrated that it is possible to see through the tube and pass objects through it. The tube, the blades and the rods are then pulled out of the cabinet and the front panel is removed, revealing the assistant unharmed and still held in position by the restraints. History References listed below attribute the creation of this illusion to British magician Val Walker. Tad Ware, writing in the magazine Magicol, has made a case that The Radium Girl was a source of inspiration to P.T. Selbit when he created an illusion called Sawing Through. Given that Selbit is widely credited with performing the first \\"sawing a woman in half\\" illusion in 1921 this would suggest that The Radium Girl pre-dates many other well-known \\"big box\\" type illusions. Some sources give 1919 as the date when Walker first presented The Radium Girl. Known performances in more recent times include a presentation by English magician Jeffery Atkins at the FISM congress in Paris in 1973. Atkins, together with host Paul Daniels and an assistant named Jackie, also performed the illusion on an episode of the BBC television series The Paul Daniels Magic Show (see picture). Another television magician, David Nixon, performed a version on one of his shows in the 1970s using singer Anita Harris as his assistant. He titled it the Thai Torture Trial but, other than the omission of some restraints, it was essentially the same as the Radium Girl.

The cloister. The Cathedral of St. Mary of La Seu Vella (Catalan and Spanish: Catedral de Santa Maria de la Seu Vella, English: St. Mary of the Old See) is the former cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lleida, in Lleida, Catalonia, Spain, located on top of Lleida hill. In 1707, the Gothic cathedral was turned into a military citadel by decision of King Philip V of Spain. The new cathedral, known as the Seu Nova (New See) and located downhill at Carrer Major, was consecrated in 1781.La Catedral nueva de Lleida Nevertheless, the Seu Vella is the defining monument of Lleida, the symbol of the city, being visible from its hilltop site anywhere in the city. History The site was previously occupied by a Palaeo-Christian and Visigothic cathedral, which later, after the Islamic conquest of Spain, was rebuilt in 832 to be used as a mosque. In 1149, after the city's conquest by the Christian Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona and Ermengol VI of Urgell (1149), the structure was reconsecrated as \\"Santa Maria Antiqua\\", and entrusted to canons regular. In 1193, however, the cathedral chapter ordered the construction of a new edifice, following the contemporary Romanesque architectural canons, to master Pere de Coma. The first stone was laid in 1203 by King Peter II of Aragon and count Ermengol VII of Urgell. Construction continued throughout the reign of James I of Aragon. It was consecrated to the Virgin Mary on 31 October 1278. The cloisters not were completed until the 14th century. The bell tower was begun in 14th century and finished in 1431. The portal Porta dels Ap√≤stols begun in the 14th and completed in 15th century. In 1707, the city was conquered by the troops of Philip V: the king ordered the destruction of the cathedral because it has taken a prominent part in the city's defense. Nevertheless, the order was never executed, and the cathedral was converted into barracks. The building was declared a national monument in 1918, and restoration works were started in 1950. View from east of La Seu Vella, old cathedral and bishop's buildings (1286) and fortress (1707) on Tur√≥ de la Seu Vella in Lleida (Photo 2017) Description The cathedral is designed in a transitional style between Romanesque and Gothic. It lacks almost any influence of Islamic architecture. The floor plan is of a basilica in a Latin cross with a nave and two aisles. The tower is octagonal with a central space of five apses. The interior was decorated in painted murals and sculpture, much of which is still preserved, but much of which has been despoiled during the War of Spanish Succession. The octagonal tower is in diameter at its base, but at the top. Its maximum height is and it contains 238 steps. A bell named M√≤nica announces the quarter-hours and one Silvestra announces the hours. The bells are of the international Gothic style of the 15th century. Star of David, in the cloister of the Old Cathedral of Lleida. The cloister is unusually placed in front of the main entrance of the church, and is notable for both its rare opened gallery with views over the city and for its extraordinary size. In fact, this cloister has been regarded as one of the largest cloisters in Europe. This cloister has 17 ornate Gothic windows, each of them different. Among them, one could point out the Muslim window of \\"the palmtrees\\" and the central one of the westernmost wing, with a complex decoration which includes both a King David's Star and a Christian cross.

Many defendants were accused of high treason. One of them ‚Äì Jaan Tomp ‚Äì was sentenced to death and 39 other people to forced labour for life. The trial of the 149 was one of the largest trials in the pre-war Republic of Estonia. Background During the 1920s, Estonia was a politically stable country with a mainly agrarian economy, the industrial base was relatively small and the peasantry were largely satisfied with the government's land redistribution policies of 1919‚Äì1920, thus there was little sympathy for the communists. Following the failed Hamburg Uprising and Bulgarian September Uprising, the Estonian authorities decided to crack down on the small but very militant Estonian Communist Party. On 21 January 1924, the security police raided a club called \\"The Workers' Cellar\\" (T√∂√∂liste kelder) where 185 representatives of workers' organisations had gathered for a meeting. The names of people present were recorded and the chairmen of the meeting ‚Äì Hendrik Allik, Paul Keerdo and Jaan Tomp ‚Äì were arrested. That same day, Vladimir Kangur was arrested in Narva. They all were accused of being the founders of the Workers' United Front (T√∂√∂rahva √úhine V√§erind). Several members of the Riigikogu also belonged to this organisation. This raid was the first in a series of operations that led to the arrest of 200 people. Communist newspapers and organisations were shut down. 229 workers' societies were dissolved as they were accused of unconstitutional activities. Some of the arrested communists managed to escape and they could not be tried. In the end 149 people were prosecuted. Trial Most of the accused did not admit guilt. Some of those who did came up with the excuse that they needed the money provided by Soviet communists to improve their life. Of 149 defendants, 88 declined a lawyer. Not all defendants were present in the courtroom, and some had to be removed as they started to protest. One of the removed persons was Vladimir Kangur, a member of Riigikogu. Some people could not be arrested and tried because of their status as members of parliament. Some of these included Eliise Priks, Eduard Luts and Aleksander Rimmel. The defendants faced different charges. The whole bill of indictment was 150 pages long. The most general and common charge was \\"participation in a pan-Estonian secret communist organisation\\". Verdict The verdict was read on 27 November 1924. * 39 people were sentenced to forced labour for life; * 28 people were sentenced to forced labour for 15 years; * 6 people were sentenced to forced labour for 12 years; * 19 people were sentenced to forced labour for 10 years; * 6 people were sentenced to forced labour for 8 years; * 15 people were sentenced to forced labour for 6 years; * 5 people were sentenced to prison for 4 years; * 11 people were sentenced to prison for 3 years. Seven defendants were acquitted of all charges: Otto Laas, August Palovere, Peeter Palovere, Jaan Pois, Bernhard Sepp, Paul Sepp and Johan Steinfeldt. Jaan Tomp had received his verdict before the others. He had been sentenced to death and executed on 14 November 1924. =Life sentences= The 39 defendants sentenced to forced labour for life were: Hendrik Allik, Aleksander Jaanson, Vladimir Kangur, Paul Keerdo, August Hansen, Madis Kask, Johannes Kuppar, Peeter Petree, Jaan Kamberg, Aleksander Reinson, Johannes Suuster, Joosep Saat, Herman Arbon, Karl Tuisk, Elfriede Morgenson, Rosalie Veltson, Leena Laid, Aliide Sommerling, Wilhelmine Kruul, Olga K√ºnnapuu, Oskar Sepre, Voldemar Sassi, Peeter Mihelson, August Kuhlberg, Jakob Saar, Arnold Veimer, Georg Abels, Wladimir Rea, J√ºri Vilt, Peeter Jentson, Johannes Oinas, Johannes Roots, Paul Krams, Karl Kuusk, Karl Pauk, Andrei Murro, Voldemar Jurjev, Johannes Jaama, and Adolf Pauk. =15 years forced labour= The 28 defendants (including seven children) sentenced to 15 years of forced labour were: Aleksander Resev, Richard Busch, Leontine Vels, Elmar Bauer, Alfred Valdsak, Johan Leesment, Heinrich Kallas, Johannes Leimann, Eduard Vei, August M√§emat, Elise Briks, Jakob Ts√µgankov, Gustav Lange, Hans Tiruson, Jaan Tagel, Boris Kumm, Anton Leerimaa, Feliks Tipman, Ludmilla Uusmann/Ausmann, Aleksander Rimmel, Eduard Luts, Ernst Heidemann, Adolf Silmer, Johannes Oravas, Bernhard Tinnori, Voldemar Hannibal, Alide Silberg/Silber and Eduard Jaama.

Formerly placed in the family Emberizidae, it is now considered a tanager. It is found in grassland in southernmost South America. There are two subspecies: M. m. melanodera in the Falkland Islands and M. m. princetoniana in southern Argentina and Chile. Description left The male is grey-green above and yellow below with a grey head and upper breast. It has a black throat and mask which are bordered with white. There are large yellow patches in the wings and tail. Females are brown with dark streaks. They have yellow outer tail- feathers and yellow fringes to the wing feathers. It is 14‚Äì15 cm long. Birds on the mainland are smaller than those on the Falklands with a smaller bill and more yellow in the wings and tail. The call is a short, high-pitched note and the song is a repeated series of two or three whistles. It sings from a low perch such as a rock or grass tussock. Distribution and habitat It is common throughout the Falklands where it occurs up to about 150m above sea- level but is most often found in coastal areas. On the South American mainland it is thinly-distributed up to 580m above sea-level in Magallanes Region in Chile and Santa Cruz Province in Argentina. Its range extends southwards from about 47¬∞S to northern Tierra del Fuego. It is typically found in flat areas of grassland, heathland, farmland or dunes. The population on the Falklands is about 7,000-14,000 pairs and the species is not considered to be threatened. However it is thought to be declining on the mainland because of overgrazing. Behaviour It forages on the ground, feeding mainly on seeds, especially those of grasses. The nest is built of grass and lined with hair or feathers. It is placed low down in grass or between stones. Three or four eggs are laid, these are blue-grey or grey-green with purple-brown markings towards the larger end. References * BirdLife International (2006) Species factsheet: Melanodera melanodera.

They had close contacts with the Tervingi, another Gothic people, who lived west of the Dniester River. To the east of the Greuthungi, living near the Don river, were the Alans. When the Huns arrived in the European Steppe region in the late 4th century, first the Alans were forced to join them, and then a part of the Greuthungi. Alans and Goths became an important part of Attila's forces, together with other eastern European peoples. Many Greuthungi, together with some Alans and Huns, crossed the Lower Danube to join a large group of Tervingi who had entered the Roman empire in 376. These peoples defeated an imperial army in the Battle of Adrianople in 378, and came to a settlement agreement within the Roman empire by 382. The original tribal names of the Goths fell out of use within the empire. Many of the 382 settlers appear to have become an important component of the Visigoths who formed under Alaric I. Based upon interpretations of the Getica by the 6th century writer Jordanes, although it never mentions the Greuthungi, the Greuthungi are strongly associated with both the Gothic king Ermanaric, and the later Amal dynasty who were among Attila's Goths. After the collapse of Attila's empire, the Amals founded the Ostrogothic kingdom in the Roman Balkans. Etymology The root greut- is probably related to the Old English greot, meaning \\"gravel, grit, earth\\", thus implying that the name refers to a geographical region where the Greuthungi lived.Sch√∂feld, W√∂rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und v√∂lkernamen, p.113 It has been argued, for example by Herwig Wolfram, who agrees with the older position of Franz Altheim that this is part of a body of evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea ‚Äî both before and after Gothic settlement there. More specifically, Wolfram argues that the name Greuthungi may indicate that they lived on gritty steppes or \\"pebbly coasts\\", and should be seen as contrasting with the Tervingi Goths, whose name may be related to the English word \\"tree\\" and indicate a forest origin. Another proposal is that the name of the Greuthungi goes back to a time when Goths apparently lived near the Vistula, and that the name is connected to the Polish place-name on that river, GrudziƒÖdz. It has also been proposed that the name Greuthungi has pre- Pontic Scandinavian origins, earlier than the Vistula settlement. Wolfram for example notes that J. Svennung, has proposed that it may mean \\"rock people\\", and refer to a rocky homeland west of the Gauts in what is today G√∂taland in southern Sweden. It has also been noted by some scholars, starting with Karl M√ºllenhoff in the 19th century, that in a list of peoples living on the island of Scandza, Jordanes listed \\"Mixi, Evagre, and Otingis\\" among those who \\"live like wild animals in rocks hewn out like castles\\".Latin and translation given at M√ºllenhoff proposed that the last part referred to the Greutungi, but no consensus has arisen to explain all the names of peoples in this list. History An unreliable later text, the Historia Augusta text concerning the Emperor Probus (died 282), mentions the Greuthungi together with Vandals and Gepids, who were supposedly settled in Thrace, together with 100,000 Bastarnae. While the Bastarnae remained faithful, the other three peoples broke faith and were crushed by Probus, according to this account.Historia Augusta, \\"Probus\\". See . Still more doubtful, in the Historia Augusta article for Emperor Claudius Gothicus (reigned 268-270), the following list of \\"Scythian\\" peoples is given who had been conquered by that emperor when he earned his title \\"Gothicus\\": \\"peuci trutungi austorgoti uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli\\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \\"Peuci, Grutungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, Celtae etiam et Eruli\\". The first event which can confidently be ascribed to the Greuthungi was much later, in the 369 campaign against the Goths by Emperor Valens, in retribution for the support of the usurper Procopius (died 366). This was described by Ammianus Marcellinus writing in the 390s, decades later.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book 27, 5.6. Valens crossed the Lower Danube at Novidunum and went deep into Gothic territory where he came across the warlike people called the Greuthungi. Their apparent leader Athanaric who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \\"iudicem potentissimum\\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the Tervingi, raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths. The Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book 31. The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. Jordanes in his history of the Goths, the Getica, written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the Ostrogoths and Visigoths of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, Ammianus Marcellinus, himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, implying that his kingdom was not as large as that described by Jordanes.Heather, Peter, 1998, The Goths, Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, Rome's Gothic Wars, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112. According to Ammianus, the defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax, while Videricus, Vithimer's son, was a boy. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the Carpathians. In 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the Lower Danube entering the Roman Empire with weapons, under the command of Fritigern, who had split from Athanaric. As tensions rose, Alatheus and Saphrax also crossed with Greuthingi and their king Videricus, despite their requests for permission having been rejected. Athanaric, who was apparently with them before they crossed, moved instead to a mountainous and forested region called Caucalanda, forcing Sarmatians out of the area. Alans and Huns also crossed in 377. The displacement of the Goths into the Balkans peninsula led to the Gothic War of 376‚Äì382 during which the Greuthungi of Alatheus and Saphrax were allied with the Tervingi of Fritigern. Greuthungi cavalry contributed to the decisive Gothic victory at the Battle of Adrianople of 9 August 378. In 382 there a more lasting settlement agreement was made for the large number of Goths to settle peacefully in the Balkans, and contribute to the Roman military. Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear. In 380, some of the Greuthungi under Alatheus and Saphrax appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the Diocese of Pannonia in the Northern Balkans, but were defeated by Emperor Gratian. The outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by Gratian, or that they reached a separate peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.Peter Heather, The Fall of the Roman Empire. A New History of Rome and the Barbarians (2005), 183-185. Several sources report more Greuthungi who were still outside of the empire in 386, under a leader from outside the Empire named Odotheus. He gathered large forces north of the Lower Danube, including peoples from far away. He attempted to cross the river, but was massacred by a Roman general named Promotus. It appears to be these Greuthungi were then settled in Phrygia and rebelled in 399-400. They are referred in a poem by Claudian which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting that land together, and fighting for the Roman military, ready to be aroused by some small offense, and return to their natural ways.Concerning the Phrygian Greuthungi: *Claudian, Against Eutropius, 2.141 *Commentary relevant to the Greutungi: , *On the connection to the 386 Greuthungi see *On the dating of Claudian's poem see . The poem associates this rebellious squadron (alae) in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, Tribigild. Claudian uses the term Ostrogoth once, and in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \\"Getic\\" (an older word, used for Goths generally in this period). Zosimus also mentioned Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch Eutropius the consul (died 399). Gainas, the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.Zosimus, New History, Book 5. For more context on this incident see In contrast, the Amal dynasty, around whom the later and better- known Othogothic kingdom formed, were in neither of these groups who entered the Roman Empire in the 4th century, because into the 5th century they were apparently Gothic leaders within Attila's Hunnic Empire. Archaeology In time and geographical area, the Greutungi and their neighbours, the Thervingi, correspond to parts of the archaeological Chernyakhov culture. =Settlement pattern= Chernyakhov settlements cluster in open ground in river valleys. The houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall- houses. The largest known settlement (Budesty) is 35 hectares. =Burial practices= Chernyakhov cemeteries include both cremation and inhumation burials in which the head is to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools but almost never any weapons. Relationship with Ostrogoths The Tervingi were first attested by 291, indicating that different Gothic peoples already had distinct identities and names by that time.Wolfram, 24. The Greuthungi are first named by Ammianus Marcellinus, writing no earlier than 392 and perhaps later than 395. The earliest events where he describes the Grethungi were in the 360s. The Ostrogoths, are also first mentioned in a poem by Claudian which describes the Ostrogoths and Greutungi inhabiting the land of Phrygia. Despite such records which seem to show the Ostrogoths and Greutungi as distinct, according to Herwig Wolfram, the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greutungi or Vesi/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs. When the names were used together, Wolfram argues that it is significant that the pairing was always preserved, as in Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi. The nomenclature of Greuthungi and Tervingi fell out of use shortly after 400. In general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after it entered the Roman Empire. Wolfram believes that because the term Greuthungi was a geographical identifier the terminology dropped out of use after the Goths were displaced by the Hunnic invasions.Burns, 44. In support of this, Wolfram cites Zosimus as referring to the group of \\"Scythians\\" north of the Danube who were called \\"Greuthungi\\" by the barbarians north of the Ister in 386.Wolfram, 387 n57. Wolfram concludes that these were in fact the Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest. according to this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people. That the Greuthungi were the Ostrogothi is an idea derived from the medieval writer Jordanes.Heather, 52-57, 300-301. He identified the Ostrogothic kings from Theodoric the Great to Theodahad as the heirs of the Greuthungian king Ermanaric. Although Jordanes' explanation of the family succession is in direct conflict with the more reliable and contemporary information of Ammianus, there has been a long tradition of scholarly attempts to reconcile the two accounts, but these have not succeeded in creating any consensus. Peter Heather for example has written that the \\"Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name\\".
