It is one of the oldest cantonments in India, the construction of which was started in 1848 after the first Anglo-Sikh War, when the British settled in Northern India. The original scope of this cantonment was limited to troops to quell disturbances from adjoining States for the maintenance of peace and order. In 1920 the cantonment was the scene of mutiny by Irish soldiers, who took down the Union Flag and replaced it by the flag of the Irish Republic, proclaimed at the time in Dublin (See The Connaught Rangers#Mutiny in India, 1920). Jalandhar CantonmentCantonment is dotted with buildings dating back to British eraThe departure of British from India and subsequent partition of the country changed the complexion of the Cantonment. It has gained tremendous importance on account of its nearness to the border with Pakistan. The Cantonment is located between latitude 30¬∞ 18' and longitude 75¬∞ 37' on the southwest and at a distance of 2 km from Cantonment Railway Station and 5 km from City Railway Station. It is situated beside Grand Trunk Road at a distance of 89 km from Amritsar and 371 km from Delhi. It covers an area of 5.87 square miles (15.2 km¬≤). It is on Amritsar-Delhi Broad Gauge Main Line. A Class-I airfield at Adampur is situated at a distance of 19 km. The airfield is linked with Jalandhar Cantonment by rail and road. It has a Recruiting Office located on Kothi #1. This Recruiting Office was responsible for enlisting the soldiers for Army, Navy and Air Force. The first Recruiting Officer who held this post until 1952 was Col. Dilbagh Singh Minhas of Jallandhar Doab. History Jalander cantonment is the ancient cantonment of India which was constructed after the first Anglo-Sikh war in 1848. Most of the families settled here are from Rajasthan. 70% of people are Marwari. The first family that came here is family of Shri Om Parkash Gupta. In 1920 Irish soldiers let down the union flag and it was later restored by the Irish Republic from Jalander cantonment. It is the part of Jalandhar.

It was begun in the 1980s as Miracle Ultra Mart, and was an attempt by the Miracle Mart department store and Miracle Food Mart supermarket chains to expand. Both chains were owned by Steinberg's Stores, a Quebec-based supermarket chain. When Steinberg's Ontario grocery operations were acquired by A&P; Canada in 1990, the Miracle Food Mart stores continued to operate under their former banner until eventually being converted to A&P; Canada's \\"A&P;\\" and \\"Dominion\\" banners. A&P; Canada continued the Miracle Ultra Mart banner as Ultra Mart, before changing its name to Ultra Food & Drug in the mid-1990s. The Miracle Mart department stores (rebranded \\"M\\" by the time) were not included in this transaction, and remained part of Steinburg until they were closed when the company went bankrupt in 1992. Ultra Food & Drug returned to ownership by a Quebec company in 2006 when A&P; Canada was acquired by Metro Inc. Up and until this date, A&P; Canada had left the Ultra Food & Drug banner alone. It was well noted in the communities of the Ultra stores that A&P; owned and operated the Ultra stores. Many customers who had grown up in the Toronto area were familiar with and happy to shop at Dominion stores. The relationship between the A&P;, Dominion and Ultra banners remained strong and customers came to expect the same experience when visiting any of the three banners. Many customers who would travel to other areas of Ontario from Toronto would notice the similar design and branding as the Dominion stores. The Ultra banners were primarily found outside of the GTA, specifically in Guelph, Oakville/Burlington, Brampton (Bramalea), as well as some eastern Ontario cities such as Belleville, Ontario. The Ultra banner store sales were a significant portion of A&P; Canada's revenues, and the stores seemed to \\"survive on their own,\\" with little management. Although many of the Ultra stores had \\"above average store sales,\\" some of the Ultra stores were known to outperform many of the A&P; and Dominion stores, primarily the Ultra Food&Drug; store located at Stone Road and Edinburgh in Guelph. The Guelph Ultra store was known by many at A&P;'s head office as being a market leader. The Guelph store had fierce competition from Zehrs Markets, a division of Loblaws, Inc. The Ultra store opened in Guelph on February 13, 1997 and maintained a healthy market share, primarily because of the noticeable customer service over their competitors. Guelph's store employed a number of high school and University of Guelph students that took on customer service head-on under the leadership of the store management. Many of these students were allotted power and authorization not seen in any of A&P;'s other stores. This focus on customer service was initially seen as critical in order to make the store successful. While customer service was critical to the success of the Guelph store, the store was also well known for being open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - something no other grocer in the city of Guelph offered. The Guelph store was also seen regularly participating in local community events such as the Santa Clause Parade, Guelph's July 1 celebrations at Riverside Park, Heart and Strokes Big Bike event (a bicycle built for 30 people) as well as 365 days a year bin drop off for the Guelph Food Bank. On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it will invest $200 million consolidating the company's conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all Dominion, A&P;, Loeb, the Barn and Ultra banners were converted to be Metro; the Food Basics brand was retained in the discount food segment.The Globe and Mail, \\"Metro battles brand confusion with a $200-million makeover\\", 7 August 2008 The final three Ultra Food and Drug locations were converted by November 14, 2008.

Each line of motion controlling G-code consists of two parts: the type of motion from the last cutter location to the next cutter location (e.g. \\"G01\\" means linear, \\"G02\\" means circular), and the next cutter location itself (the cartesian point (20, 1.3, 4.409) in this example). \\"G01 X20Y1.3Z4.409\\" The fundamental basis for creating the cutter paths suitable for CNC milling are functions that can find valid cutter locations, and stringing them together in a series. There are two broad and conflicting approaches to the problem of generating valid cutter locations, given a CAD model and a tool definition: calculation by offsets, and calculation against triangles. Each is discussed in a later section of this article. The most common example of the general cutter location problem is cutter radius compensation (CRC), in which an endmill (whether square end, ball end, or bull end) must be offset to compensate for its radius. Since the 1950s, CRC calculations finding tangency points on the fly have been done automatically within CNC controls, following the instructions of G-codes such as G40, G41, and G42. The chief inputs have been the radius offset values stored in the offset registers (typically called via address D) and the left/right climb/conventional distinction called via G41 or G42 (respectively). With the advent of CAM software, which added a software-aided option to complement the older manual-programming environment, much of the CRC calculations could be moved to the CAM side, and various modes could be offered for how to handle CRC. Although 2-axis or 2.5-axis CRC problems (such as calculating toolpaths for a simple profile in the XY plane) are quite simple in terms of computational power, it is in the 3-, 4-, and 5-axis situations of contouring 3D objects with a ball-endmill that CRC becomes rather complex. This is where CAM becomes especially vital and far outshines manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to servo inputs themselves, internally.  By offsets  Start with a UV parametric point in a freeform surface, calculate the xyz point and the normal, and offset from the point along the normal in a way consistent with the tool definition so that the cutter is now tangent to the surface at that point. Problems: may collide or gouge with the model elsewhere, and there is no way to tell this is happening except with a full implementation of the triangulated approach. Most published academics believe this is the way to find cutter locations, and that the problem of collisions away from the point of contact is soluble. However, nothing printed so far comes close to handling real world cases.  Against triangles  Start with the XY component for a cutter location and loop across every triangle in the model. For each triangle which crosses under the circular shadow of the cutter, calculate the Z value of the cutter location required for it to exactly touch the triangle, and find the maximum of all such values. Hwang et al. describe this approach in 1998, for cylindrical, ball-end, and bull-end milling tools. These ideas are further developed in a 2002 paper by Chuang et al. In a paper from 2004 Yau et al. describe an algorithm for locating an APT-cutter against triangles. Yau et al. use a kd-tree for finding overlapping triangles. Problems: requires a lot of memory to hold enough triangles to register the model at a tight enough tolerance, and it takes longer to program to get your initial cutter location values. However, they are at least guaranteed valid in all cases. This is how all major CAM systems do it these days because it works without failing no matter what the complexity and geometry of the model, and can be made fast later. Reliability is far more important than efficiency. The above refers to 3-axis machines. 5-axis machines need a special entry of their own.  ZMap  The ZMap algorithm was proposed in the academic literature by Byoung K Choi in 2003 as a way of precalculating and storing a regular array of cutter location values in the computer memory. The result is a model of the height map of cutter positions from which in between values can be interpolated. Due to accuracy issues, this was generalized into an Extended ZMap, or EZMap, by the placement of \\"floating\\" points in between the fixed ZMap points. The location of the EZMap points are found iteratively when the ZMap is created. EZMap points are only placed where sharp edges occur between the normal ZMap points; a completely flat source geometry will not require any EZMap points.

He was appointed to the Army of the North under Manuel Belgrano as commander of artillery, and later founded the first sapper corps in the Argentine Army (1813). Son of Eduard Kaunitz and Amalia O'Donell, Holmberg studied in military academy in Prussia between 1794 and 1795. He served during the Napoleonic Wars with the Duchy of Berg and later on fought in Spain where he met and established a relationship with the future Argentine army officers Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Jos√© Zapiola and Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear. Around 1812 he traveled to Buenos Aires on the British frigate George Canning, which was transporting the Aregine fighters from Europe, attracted by the possibility of fighting in the South American wars of independence. He arrived on 9 March and was noted in the daily Gazeta de Buenos Ayres a few days later: Kaunitz was an amateur botanist, and had in his luggage several collections of bulbs from floral plants unknown in Argentina. On 20 March 1812 he joined the Army of the North, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the artillery of Belgrano's army. He made excellent relations with the general, being of assistance at the battles of Las Piedras (1812) and Tucum√°n, but he had uneasy relations and some enmities with other army officers which made him leave this army after the last battle. He continued the campaign at the front in Montevideo, where in 1813 he would found the first sapper corps in the army. At the beginning of 1814 the government commanded him to fight and capture Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, but he fell wounded at the battle of Espinillo fighting Fernando Torgu√©s, whom pardoned his life and released him along with his adjutant, lieutenant Hilari√≥n de la Quintana. Kaunitz married Antonia Balbastro, a cousin of Alvear; his son Eduardo Wenceslao also served as an officer under Juan Lavalle. The national government gave him in 1821 the task of building forts in the south of Buenos Aires Province. In 1826 he fought in the war with Brazil under the command of his old friend from the campaigns in Spain, Alvear. He died in 1853, a little after the birth of his first grandson, Eduardo Ladislao, who would become one of the greatest naturalists of the country.

The Buddhist texts don't mention him, and instead name the first Nanda ruler as robber-turned-king Ugrasena, who was succeeded by his eight sons, the last of whom was Chandranada And Ghananada.  Life  According to the Puranas, the first Nanda king was called Mahapadma or Mahapadma-pati (literally, \\"lord of immense wealth\\"). While some sources claim that he was the son of the last Shaishunaga king Mahanandin there are many texts and sources which claim that Mahapadma Nanda was actually a barber who was of low-caste and a few others claim that his mother was a shudra and his father was the Shaishunaga king Mahanandin. A few texts say that Mahapadma Nanda, a barber before ascending the throne, became the former queen's paramour thanks to his attractive looks,then he treacherously assassinated the then king, usurped the supreme authority by pretending to act as a guardian for the then princes, and later killed the princes thus become the Emperor of the new Nanda Empire The Puranas describe him as ekarat (sole sovereign) and sarva-kshatrantaka (destroyer of all the Kshatriyas). The Kshastriyas (warriors and rulers) said to have been exterminated by Mahapadma include Maithalas, Kasheyas, Ikshvakus, Panchalas, Shurasenas, Kurus, Haihayas, Vitihotras, Kalingas, and Ashmakas. The Matsya Purana assigns Mahapadma an incredibly long reign of 88 years, while the Vayu Purana mentions the length of his reign as only 28 years. The Puranas further state that Mahapadma's eight sons ruled in succession after him for a total of 12 years, but name only one of these sons: Sukalpa. Indologist F. E. Pargiter dated Nanda's coronation to 382 BCE, and historian R. K. Mookerji dated it to 364 BCE. Historian H. C. Raychaudhuri places the event at c. 345 BCE. Beginning of Nanda reign is also assign as early as 5th century BC.  Other descriptions of the first Nanda king  * According to the Buddhist texts, the first Nanda king was Ugrasena, not Mahapadma. ** Unlike the Puranas, which assign mixed royal-Shudra ancestry to Mahapadma, the Buddhist texts describe Ugrasena as of \\"unknown lineage\\". According to the Mahavamsa-tika, Ugrasena was a native of the frontier region: he was captured by a gang of robbers, and later became their leader. ** The Greco-Roman sources call the Nanda king ruling at the time of Alexander's invasion \\"Agrammes\\", which is possibly a corruption of the Sanskrit term \\"Augraseniya\\" (literally, \\"son or descendant of Ugrasena\\"). ** Unlike the Puranas, the Buddhist texts describe the next eight kings as brothers - not sons - of the first Nanda king. Also, according to the Buddhist tradition, the Nandas ruled for a total of 22 years. The last of these kings was Dhana Nanda. * According to the Jain texts such as Parishishtaparvan and Avashyaka sutra, which do not mention the name \\"Mahapadma\\" either, the Nanda king was the son of a courtesan by a barber. They state that Nanda succeeded Udayin after his death from a rival king. They further state Kalpaka, a non- violent Jain, as his chief-minister, who is believed to have sacrificed his life for peace. * The Greco-Roman sources suggest that the founder of the Nanda dynasty was a barber, who usurped the throne from the last king of the preceding dynasty. Roman historian Curtius (1st century CE) states that according to Porus, this barber became the former queen's paramour thanks to his attractive looks, treacherously assassinated the then king, usurped the supreme authority by pretending to act as a guardian for the then princes, and later killed the princes. The Nanda king who was the contemporary of Porus and Alexander was the son of this barber.

The journal Unsere Liebe Frau von Himmerod (\\"Our Lady of Himmerod\\") appears three times a year, and the newsletter Himmeroder Rundbrief (ed. Father Stephan) about 10 times a year. Himmerod memorandum From 5 October to 9 October 1950, officers of the former Wehrmacht, on the authority of the West German government, met in conference at Himmerod Abbey to prepare for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to launch the re-armament of Germany. The conference produced the Himmerod memorandum (German: Himmeroder Denkschrift), which laid out the prerequisites for re-armament and suggested what Germany could contribute to the defense of western Europe. This was an important step toward the official founding of the Bundeswehr in 1955.

Today Michael Park is an integrated Area School, providing seamless education for students from Playgroup (children aged 2‚Äì3 years), Nursery (2¬Ω - 4 years), Kindergarten (4‚Äì6 years), lower school (6‚Äì14 years) to high school (students aged 14‚Äì18 years). The Steiner School refers to the years 2 to 13 as Class 1 to Class 12.  Steiner's Philosophy  Unlike 'conventional' state schools, the Steiner philosophy encourages a slightly later development, and a more creative environment. Another unique aspect of Michael Park is their keen eye for aesthetics. The belief is that more graceful architecture will be beneficial to student's learning, meaning that there are less right angles in the school buildings and more curves. =Independent Study= One of the key things making Rudolf Steiner schools unique is the year-long project of each and every 7th Form/Year 13 student. The student is encouraged to learn or develop a skill, complete an exercise and assist the community. Some recent projects have included: learning to play a musical instrument, making a short film, learning authorship or painting, restoration/building of cars, boats, etc. The student study is assessed on many levels including the presentation of an oral speech, and development of records (i.e., keeping a diary or their efforts) and compiling a visual display to represent their work and what they've learned over the course of the year. The final result of the Independent Study contributes substantially to their Steiner certificate results for the year.  Qualifications  This is a state integrated school (i.e., they are largely funded by Government subsidy). This way, Michael Park School students can participate in both government standard assessment, NCEA as well as Steiner School Certificate. Currently Steiner School Certificate is offered at Level 1. Sporting success Michael Park has had an unusually high proportion of students representing New Zealand in sport, particularly lacrosse. Their school team, the MPS Storm, contained eight members of the Under-19 New Zealand Men's Lacrosse team, including the captain, Toby Delamore.

His website, at PlantSystematics.org, also presents material on plant taxonomy including the Reveal system. He published extensively on North American flora, was a member of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and was one of the authors of the APG II and APG III classifications. At the time of his death, Reveal was a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, adjunct professor at Cornell University's Department of Plant Biology and honorary curator at the New York Botanical Garden. Biography =Early life and education= James Lauritz Reveal was born on March 29, 1941, in Reno, Nevada to Arlene Hadfield Reveal and Jack Lilburn Reveal (1912-1988), a librarian and a forester/botanist, respectively.The elder Reveal collected extensively in California, Nevada, and (with Reid Moran) Baja California, Mexico. Reveal attended Utah State University (B.S. 1964, M.S. 1966) and received his Ph.D. from Brigham Young University in 1969. He held a post-doctoral fellowship with the Smithsonian Institution from 1967 to 1969. =Career= In 1969, Reveal joined the Botany faculty at the University of Maryland, serving as director of the Norton-Brown Herbarium of the University of Maryland between 1979 and 1999. During his tenure, the Norton-Brown Herbarium amassed one of the greatest collections of Polygonaceae subfam. Eriogonoideae in the world. Reveal's research interests included botanical studies in the American West, especially endangered and threatened species. He studied the history of botanical exploration in the New World and botanical nomenclature and taxonomy as well, with much of his research and writing devoted to the Polygonaceae subfamily Eriogonoideae, commonly known as the wild buckwheats. His interest in combining history and botany led to projects on botanical history of colonial Maryland and on the botanical discoveries of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, about which he wrote several books and articles. A prolific collector, author, and speaker, Reveal collected more than 9,000 plant specimens from North America, Central America, and China, and published over 500 papers; he presented more than 100 invited talks. As a member of the Smithsonian Institution's Endangered Species Committee (1974-1982), Reveal was instrumental in attaining the addition of endangered plant species to the original Endangered Species Act. Reveal discovered or identified over fifty plant varieties, most of these discoveries being flowering plants of the American Southwest. In 1968, Reveal identified five new plant varieties at a Nevada nuclear testing site. In 1981, Reveal and Norlyn James Bodkin, then professor of Botany at James Madison University, identified a new lily variety, the first new plant discovery along the eastern U.S. seaboard since the 1940s. They named the new variety of Virginia Wake Robin Trillium pusillum var. monticulum (Shenandoah Wake Robin). In 1978, Reveal married his University of Maryland colleague, the botanist C. Rose Broome (later with the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture). They collaborated on many research projects, most notably the botanical studies of colonial Maryland and explorations in Mexico that identified two new plant varieties. Reveal helped document the flora of Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic and assisted in Broome's 1979 publication of the first checklist of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plant Species in Maryland. In 1992, Reveal's illustrated Gentle Conquest: The Botanical Discovery of North America was published. Gentle Conquest encompasses the history of botanical exploration in the New World from the first settlement to the end of the Western frontier. Reveal retired from the Botany Department at the University of Maryland in 1999, but remained active, holding emeritus appointments including Honorary Curator of the New York Botanical Garden (2003-2015) and Adjunct Professor at Cornell University (2007-2015), working on the Intermountain Flora project and collecting plant specimens throughout several Western U.S. states, including California, Colorado, and Nevada. He made numerous contributions to the website, Discovering Lewis & Clark. In 2009, Reveal received the North American Rock Garden Society's Edgar T. Wherry award for his contributions to the genus Eriogonum. Reveal died on January 9, 2015 in Ithaca, New York.  Reveal system  Reveal made major contributions to the systematic taxonomy of the flowering plants. in 1997 he published his own system of classification online in ten parts as lecture notes comparing the major systems in use at that time, but without accompanying rationale. Following this Reveal became an author with the consensus Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) on the APG II 2003 and APG III 2009 processes. Although this largely supplanted the earlier and competing systems, he collaborated with Robert Thorne on his system (2007), and subsequently continued to develop his own system. Eriogonum ‚Äì a genus of wild buckwheats native to North America James Reveal worked on his entire life. Legacy Reveal made major contributions to the systematics of Polygonaceae subfamily Eriogonoideae, and other families. For his many contributions to botany, seven species and one genus have been named in his honor (patronyms). *Castilleja revealii N. H. Holmgren (Orobanchaceae) *Eriogonum revealianum S. L.

He served the Russian SFSR, was a leader of the Communist Party of Estonia, the first premier of the Soviet Executive Committee of Estonia, and the chairman of the Council of The Commune of the Working People of Estonia (Estonian Eesti T√∂√∂rahva Kommuun). Imprisoned during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in 1937, he died from the injuries sustained during a beating by Aleksandr Langfang while in NKVD custody.Eesti biograafiline andmebaas ISIK: ANVELT, JAAN  Early life  Anvelt was born to a peasant family in Oorgu, V√µisiku Parish (now in Kolga-Jaani Parish), Viljandi County, Governorate of Livonia. He studied to become a schoolteacher, beginning in Dorpat (now Tartu), and then in St. Petersburg, where he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party's Bolshevik faction. He was employed as a schoolteacher from 1905 to 1907, concurrently being involved in revolutionary activity. From 1907 to 1912, Anvelt studied part-time as a student of jurisprudence at St. Petersburg University.  October Revolution  On November 5, 1917 (by the current Gregorian calendar ‚Äì October 23 by the Julian calendar still in use in Russia at the time), Bolshevik leader Jaan Anvelt led his leftist revolutionaries to the revolution in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and took political power.  Post-Revolution  After the defeat of the revolutionaries in the Baltics, Anvelt went underground, remaining active as a revolutionary, emerging as one of the leaders of the 1924 Estonian coup d'√©tat attempt. In 1925, Anvelt arrived in the USSR, in 1926‚Äì29 working as a political commissar of the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. From 1929 to 1935 he worked in top positions of the civilian air fleet's main administration. During the period from 1935 to 1937 Anvelt served as a member and an executive secretary of a department within the Comintern. Anvelt was arrested in 1937. Interrogated in custody, he died from the injuries inflicted by the interrogator Aleksandr Langfang on 11 December 1937, and was denounced as an enemy of the people afterwards. In 1956, when Khrushchev distanced himself from Stalinism, Anvelt was rehabilitated. His grandson Andres Anvelt became the Estonian Interior Minister for the Social Democratic Party in 2016.

About Cat Cat was a blustery, boozy, cigarette puffing beautician. She first appeared in Charnham as the wife of philanderer Dave Matthews, stepmother to Josh. She ran a hairdressing salon on the site later taken by Roy Farmer's cybercafe, and she employed Yasmin McHugh as an apprentice hairdresser (Yasmin's mother, Dusty was a partner in the business), however the business soon failed. After Cat's marriage to Dave broke down she moved in with Pete Callan. After several months Pete convinced her to transfer her home into his name for taxation reasons, and once she had done so revealed he had only moved in with her to con her out of her house. After the relationship ended she realised she was pregnant, and was initially unsure whether the child was Dave's or Pete's. After tests it was revealed to be Pete's. When Cat fell on hard times while struggling to raise Dave Junior and resenting Pete's interference, she fell into prostitution, and then was briefly and unhappily married to Jim Webb. She later worked as a beautician again when Yasmin opened a salon of her own. Cat eventually found happiness in her marriage to Doug MacKenzie in 2004.

However unlike the split in the Communist Party of Latvia, the split in EKP did not follow ethnic lines.

Monkeys  Macaca nigra When occurring on an animal's buttocks, as with baboons, they are specifically called ischial callosities. Ischial relates to the ischium: it forms the lower and back part of the hip bone. The pads enable the monkeys to sleep sitting upright on thin branches, beyond reach of predators, without falling. The ischial callosities are one of the most distinctive pelvic features which separates Old World monkeys from New World monkeys.Steudel (1981), p 399  Right whales  Callosities on a North Atlantic right whale In whales, the term callosity refers to the rough, calcified skin patches found on the heads of the three species of right whales. These callosities are a characteristic feature of the whale genus Eubalaena; because they are found on the head of the whale and appear white against the dark background of the whale's skin, they make it very easy to identify these species. The callosities themselves are grey; the white appearance is due to large colonies of whale lice, whale barnacles and parasitic worms which reside on them. Young whales and diseased individuals are often infested with a different species of cyamid, which gives an orange hue rather than white on these whales. Callosities arise naturally and are present even in late-term whale fetuses, although the work of lice digging into the surface of the skin may make them more jagged and hard over time. Callosities are found on the upper surface of the whale's head, above the eyes, on the jawline and chin and surrounding the blowholes. Callosities form a unique pattern on every right whale and though callosities which are overgrown break off, the patterns do not change over a lifetime. This makes them a very useful tool for the purposes of photo-identification and conservation. The evolutionary purpose of callosities is unknown. Male right whales have a higher density of callosities than females. Males have been observed scratching one another with their callosities and it has been suggested by Payne & Dorsey (1983) that this is a sexually dimorphic feature used for intra-specific sexual aggression. This explanation is not entirely satisfactory, as it does not account for the appearance of callosities in females. Alternative natural role of callosities has been considered as being optional tools against predators, and declines of right whales might have consequenced in declines of barnacles as well.https://www.researchgate.net/figure/265049647_fig3_Fig-S3-Stranded- Pacific-right-whale-Eubalaena-japonica-at-Izu-peninsula-Shimoda  See also  * Callus  Notes  References * *Callosities by Mason T.

Description The Tjurk√∂ bracteates were discovered in 1817 near Tjurk√∂ when cultivating, for the first time, a field on a stony hill.Montelius & Lindberg (1869:49). The bracteates were found in the roots of the grass among the rocks. Also discovered with the bracteates was a gold coin of the Emperor Theodosius II of the Eastern Roman Empire that has been dated to 443 AD. The Tjurk√∂ 1 bracteate is dated to the Germanic Iron Age between 400 and 650 AD and is now at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities (SHM 1453:25). It is a typical C-bracteate, similar to the Vadstena bracteate, and shows a stylized head in the center above a horse and beneath a bird. This iconography is usually interpreted as depicting an early form of the Norse pagan god Odin with his associated animals, a horse and a raven. Inscription =Tjurk√∂ 1 bracteate= The inscription of the Tjurk√∂ 1 bracteate reads: : Transliteration: :wurte runoz an walhakurne heldaz kunimundiuProject Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for DR BR75. Proto-Norse transcription: :Wurte runoz an walhakurne Heldaz Kunimundiu English translation: :Heldaz wrought runes on 'the foreign grain' for Kunimunduz. There is a consensus that walha-kurne is a compound word referring to the bracteate itself, and that walha (cognate with Modern English Welsh) means \\"foreign, non-Germanic\\" - here perhaps more specifically \\"Roman\\" or \\"Gallic.\\" However, differing explanations have been proposed for the second element kurne. According to one interpretation, kurne is the dative singular of kurna (cognate with Modern English corn), and walha-kurne \\"Roman or Gallic grain\\" is a kenning for \\"gold;\\" cf. the compounds valh√∂ll, valrau√∞r and valbaugar in the Old Norse poem Atlakvi√∞a.Looijenga (2003:42, 109). This may refer to the melting of solidi as source of the gold for the bracteate. An alternative interpretation of the second element sees kurne as an early loan from Latin corona \\"crown,\\"Brate (1922:14-15). but this is now considered to be unlikely since \\"crowns\\" as currency appear only in medieval times, from images of crowns minted on the coins' faces. The personal name Heldaz is derived from *held- \\"battle\\" (Old English hild, Old Norse hildr, etc.), while Kunimundiu (dative singular of Kunimunduz) is from kuni- \\"kin\\" (which appears with connotations of royalty as the first element of Old English compounds, cf. Modern English king) and mund- \\"protection.\\" =Tjurk√∂ 2 bracteate= The Tjurk√∂ 2 bracteate is dated to the same period and has an inscription of just three runes that read ota, which translates as \\"fear.\\"Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for DR BR76.

He was Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at Trinity College, Oxford, for more than forty years, a long-serving officer of arms, and Lord Mayor of Oxford 1970‚Äì71. Career Maclagan was born in London and educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated from Christ Church with a first class degree in 1935, and was awarded the Gladstone Memorial Exhibition. After two years as a lecturer at Christ Church, he was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1939 (the last Fellow to be so elected before the outbreak of World War II). At both Winchester and Oxford he was a member of the Officer Training Corps; and he served as President of the Oxford University Archaeological Society. =World War II= In February 1941, Maclagan was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 16th/5th Lancers, Royal Armoured Corps. He spent much of the war in staff and intelligence jobs: for a period he was in Cairo, but he was subsequently posted to Military Operations in the War Office in London, where his proficiency in Italian and Serbo-Croat stood him in good stead. He ultimately reached the rank of major. =Post-war= In 1946, Maclagan returned to Trinity College, where he remained as Fellow and Tutor in Modern History until his retirement in 1981. For many years he shared teaching duties with the early modern scholar John Phillips Cooper (1920‚Äì1978). He held various college offices (including Dean, Librarian, Senior Tutor, Vice-President, and steward of the Senior Common Room); was Senior Proctor for the University in 1954‚Äì5; and he also served as Senior Librarian (1960‚Äì70) and Trustee (1970‚Äì99) of the Oxford Union. Outside the University, he served as a university-appointed alderman on Oxford City Council, and held the offices of Sheriff in 1964‚Äì5, and Lord Mayor in 1970‚Äì71. He served as Chairman of the Oxford Diocesan Advisory Committee, 1961‚Äì85; and as Master of the Scriveners' Company, 1988‚Äì9. He had lifelong interests in heraldry and genealogy, and served both as a private officer of arms and at the College of Arms in London. He began his heraldic career in 1948 with an appointment as Slains Pursuivant of Arms, and held that office until 1970. This appointment was made by the Chief of the Name and Arms of Hay after the resurgence of private armorial officers following World War II. In 1953 Maclagan was made an Officer Brother of the Venerable Order of Saint John, and served as a Gold Staff Officer at the Coronation and as a Green Staff Officer at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. In 1970, he was appointed Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary at the College of Arms. He held this post for 10 years until his promotion to the office of Richmond Herald on 14 July 1980. Maclagan held this last office until his retirement in 1989, at the age of 75. Scholarship Maclagan was characterised by his obituary-writer in The Times as an antiquary, rather than an historian.\\"Lives in Brief\\", The Times, 21 Aug. 2003. Patric Dickinson, in the Independent, called him \\"the quintessential Oxford don ‚Äì a scholar of the old school, erudite, antiquarian and stylish\\", who \\"seemed to have strayed from an earlier age\\".P. L. Dickinson, \\"Michael Maclagan\\", The Independent, 2 Sept. 2003. He had an eclectic range of historical interests spanning all periods (particularly, but far from exclusively, in the fields of genealogy, heraldry and bibliography); he was more concerned with arcane detail, for which he had a remarkable memory, than with grand narrative; and he tended to pursue topics and projects which appealed to him, rather than those which might advance his career. All this meant that he published less than he might have done. He was a proficient linguist, fluent in Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian and Serbo-Croat, and with some knowledge of Arabic. His first book, in 1949, was a translation of part of the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation. Many of his core interests were genealogical. He had a longstanding expertise in the history of the medieval Anglo-Norman family of de Clare, although little of this came to print. His principal foray into modern history was a well-received biography of a kinsman (through his mother), the first Earl Canning, who was Governor-General of India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and first Viceroy of India. He is best known to students of royal and noble genealogies and royal families as co-author (with Ji≈ô√≠ Louda, who compiled and drew the tables, while Maclagan wrote the text) of the best-selling Lines of Succession, first published in 1981, and subsequently reprinted and revised on several occasions. He was also interested in Byzantine history, and in 1968 published a history of Constantinople. For many years he spent part of his summer vacation as a popular lecturer on Swan Hellenic cruises in the eastern Mediterranean. He was a keen bibliophile, and built up an extensive collection of rare books. In 1960 he published an edition of Bishop Richard de Bury's Philobiblon, one of the earliest studies of librarianship. He was a meticulous indexer: his biography of Canning was awarded the Society of Indexers' Wheatley Medal in 1962; and in 1988 he compiled the index for Francis Jones's Catalogue of Welsh Manuscripts in the College of Arms. Family Michael Maclagan was the son of Sir Eric Maclagan (1879‚Äì1951), for many years director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. His mother, Helen Elizabeth Lascelles (10 October 1879 ‚Äì 19 October 1942),Wombat's Family Forest -Family History and Genealogy who married Eric Maclagan on 8 July 1913, was a granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Harewood: she was a sister of Sir Alan \\"Tommy\\" Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI and a second cousin once removed to the 7th Earl of Harewood who married Mary, Princess Royal, only daughter of King George V and sister to King George VI. Maclagan's paternal grandfather was the Most Reverend William Dalrymple Maclagan (1826‚Äì1910), Archbishop of York from 1891 to 1908, and the cleric who had crowned Queen Alexandra in 1902. His paternal grandmother, second wife of the Archbishop, was the Honourable Augusta Anne Barrington (1836‚Äì1915),The Peerage.com daughter of the 6th Viscount Barrington. (Augusta Maclagan had money settled upon her when she married Maclagan, then Bishop of Lichfield, in 1878: about half her money was settled on her son Eric when he married in 1913, giving him and his wife a considerable degree of financial independence.Financial position of the Honourable Augusta Maclagan, her son Eric Maclagan, etc, in a scholarly paper on women's investments 1900-1939 (cache version)) Through both his mother and his paternal grandmother, Maclagan thus had connections to several British aristocratic families.Kittybrewster The Honourable Augusta Maclagan was a great-granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne; thus making her grandson Michael Maclagan a distant kinsman to the Queen. Personal life Maclagan was twice married. His first marriage in 1939 to a cousin, Brenda Alexander, was dissolved by divorce in 1946. His second marriage in 1949 to Jean Elizabeth Brooksbank Garnett lasted almost 54 years; she died on 3 August 2003. He died ten days later on the day of her funeral. Maclagan had a son by his first marriage, and a son (who died, aged 26, in 1984) and two daughters by his second marriage. Portrait On his retirement from Trinity in 1981, a portrait of Maclagan in his herald's tabard by Paul Brason was commissioned by the Trinity Society and presented to the College: it is now hung in the screens passage to the College dining hall.Reproduced in colour in Trinity College Oxford Report (1981), p. 2.

History The monastery was founded in 1160 at Viby, close to Sigtuna, but under the patronage of King Knut Eriksson (ca 1150 ‚Äì died 1195) who donated land and a right to parts of the fishing at √Ñlvkarleby. It was relocated in 1180 to S√§by by the lake √ñljaren in Julita. The monastery was therefore also known as S√§by, or Saba in Latin. It continued to receive rich donations from King Erik Knutsson (1210-1216), and later from other members of the aristocracy and royal circles. It was finally the owner of some 80 farms, mostly in S√∂dermanland. At the time of the Protestant Reformation, King Gustavus Vasa appropriated the abbey in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden and gave it in fief to Olof Arvidsson, a bailiff in Nyk√∂ping, in 1527. The secular estate thus created later had various possessors, including diplomat Matthias Palbitzki and members of the Lewenhaupt family. Julita Socken i S√∂dermanlands l√§n, Oppunda h√§rad Nordisk familjebok, vol. 13 (1910) In 1944, the Nordic Museum assumed the ownership of the estate in accordance with the will of the last private owner, Arthur B√§ckstr√∂m (1861-1941). The manor is now a large open-air museum, incorporating a small part of the abbey in the basement of one of its wings, which is open to the public. Together with another small building originally located outside the cloisters, this is all that can be seen of the abbey today, though archaeological excavations have revealed the full extent of the main abbey buildings.

Career Born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, Jim began his professional baseball career in the International League for the Utica, New York team. He showed his versatility by playing many different positions, as well as having a well known good throwing arm. He helped lead the Utica team to the International League championship in . This showing earned him a spot on the Cleveland Blues for the season, where he played in 109 games, batted .222, and played mainly at first base, but again showed his ability at other positions, including catcher, and all three outfield positions. Toy played minor league baseball in Brooklyn, New York for the and seasons, mainly as a catcher. He joined the Gladiators later that season, playing in 44 games, batting .181, and gathering only seven RBI. His career ended after suffering an injury when he was hit with a foul tip in the groin. Because of the lack of modern medical attention, the injury plagued him throughout the rest of his life along with cutting his career short. First Native American player? According to writer Ed Rice, Louis Sockalexis was the first American Indian player in major league baseball. In 1963, baseball writer Lee Allen claimed that Toy, an early American Association catcher, had a Lakota (Sioux) father. This claim was disputed by Rice, who located Toy's death certificate listing his race as \\"white.\\"Baseball's First Indian, Tidemark Press, 2003. Controversy still remains on this subject, due to the inaccuracy of many birth records during that time period. Modern historians have become less worried about whether the player is a \\"full-blooded\\" Native American, but rather if the player identified and aligned himself socially and culturally with his native people. Sockalexis fits this view of history, unlike Toy, who did not. Jim died at the age of 61 in Cresson, Pennsylvania, and is interred at Beaver Cemetery in Beaver, Pennsylvania.

Pribina was the first ruler of Slavic origin to build a Christian church on Slavic territory in Nitra, and also the first to accept baptism.Spiesz et al. 2006, p. 20. He was attacked and expelled from his homeland by Mojmir I, duke of Moravia. Pribina first fled to Ratpot, one of the border lords in East Francia. Thereafter he was wandering in Central and Southeastern Europe for several years. Finally, in the late 830s, Louis the German, king of East Francia granted Pribina lands near Lake Balaton (now in Hungary) where he set up his own principality under the king's suzerainty. He died fighting against the Moravians.  Early life  According to a marginal notation to the Conversion that has by now been incorporated into its main text, Pribina's allodial lands were situated in Nitrava ultra Danuvium where Archbishop Adalram of Salzburg (821-836) consecrated a church, Since Nitrava has been identified, although not unanimously, with modern Nitra in Slovakia, Pribina is considered to have ruled the large early medieval fortress excavated at that town. The consecration of the church in Nitrava took place around 827, thus it was the first church in all Eastern Europe whose existence is documented in writing. That the church was consecrated for Pribina himself (who, all the same, still remained a catechumen), or for his wife cannot be decided.Sommer et al. 2007, p. 221. She seems to have been a member of the Bavarian Wilhelminer family. Whether Pribina held Nitrava as a lieutenant of Mojmir I, the first known ruler of Moravia, or he was ‚Äì maybe the second or third ‚Äì prince of an independent Slavic principality is still debated by modern historians.Kirschbaum 2007, pp. 207., 232. The best source of his life, the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum never regarded him as dux (gentilis).SZ≈êKE, B√©la Mikl√≥s, A K√ÅRP√ÅT-MEDENCE A KAROLING-KORBAN √âS A MAGYAR HONFOGLAL√ÅS, p. 2. Nevertheless, according to the Conversion, he was \\"driven across the Danube by Mojmir, duke of the Moravians\\" shortly after the defense of the eastern marches in East Francia had been taken over by Ratpot in around 833.Bowlus 1994, pp. 101., 104., 106.  Wanderings  Having been expelled, Pribina fled to Ratpot who presented him to Louis the German. The king ordered that Pribina be baptized in the church of Traismauer (Austria) and then serve with his followers in Ratpot's army. Before long, however, Ratpot and Pribina fell out, and the latter, fearing for his life, fled with his son Koceƒæ to the First Bulgarian Empire. However, Malamir of Bulgaria had by that time made peace with East Francia, thus Pribina was unable to persuade him to act against the Franks. Subsequently, Pribina departed for Lower Pannonia, the region ruled by a Slavic prince, Ratimir. Since Lower Pannonia was part of Ratpot's prefecture, Ratimir's harboring of Pribina was tantamount to rebellion. Therefore, in 838 Louis the German sent Ratpot at the head of a large Bavarian army to crush Ratimir, but Pribina and his followers took refuge with the count of Carniola, Salacho. In short time the latter brokered a reconciliation between Ratpot and Pribina. Louis the German now devised a plan to solve the ongoing instability in Lower Pannonia by making Pribina himself the new client ruler of that region. On January 10, 846, at the request of his followers, the king granted Pribina lands near Lake Balaton on the river Zala where he was to rule as Louis the German's faithful dux (\\"duke\\").  Dux in Lower Pannonia  Principality of Lower Pannonia under Pribina's rule Pribina's main duty was to gather the groups of Slavs who were fleeing from various directions, and to keep them loyal to the Franks. For this purpose, he began to build in 846 a large fortress as his seat of power in the region of Lake Balaton, in a territory of modern Zalav√°r surrounded by forests and swamps along the river Zala. His extremely well fortified castle that became known as Blatnohrad (Blatnograd) or Moosburg (\\"Swamp Fortress\\") served as a bulwark both against the Bulgarians and the Moravians. Pribina's authority stretched from the R√°ba river to the north, to P√©cs to the southeast, and to Ptuj to the West. Pribina undertook to Christianize the local population and built churches in the region. At his request, the archbishop of Salzburg consecrated a number of churches in Lower Pannonia, among them one at modern P√©cs. Pribina also made a donation of three hundred homesteads and vineyards on a knee of the river Zala to the monastery of Niederaltaich, which was confirmed in 860 by Louis the German. Pribina seems to have played a prominent role in Louis the German's campaigns against Mojmir I of Moravia. For example, in 846 the king made a generous gift of one hundred homesteads in the Bavarian marches to him, presumably in order to help supply Pribina's troops in the upcoming campaign. Moreover, in 847 Louis the German converted all Pribina's benefices near Lake Balaton, save those he held from the archbishop of Salzburg, into personal property in order to reward him for his loyal service, presumably in the recent campaigns against the Bohemians and the Moravians. There is some uncertainty about Pribina's death. He may have been killed in a battle with the Moravians who supported Louis the German's son, Carloman in a revolt against the king, or he may have been captured and handed over to the Moravians by Carloman. His son, Koceƒæ was installed as the ruler of Lower Pannonia in 864 by Louis the German. See also *Principality of Nitra *Principality of Lower Pannonia  References   Sources  *Bartl, J√∫lius (2002).

He served as Alabama State Geologist for 34 years and was director of the Alabama Museum of Natural History. Jones undertook the first large-scale, scientific excavation of the Moundville Archaeological Site, and he founded the Jones Museum at Moundville Archaeological Park. Born in Alabama, Jones earned his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Alabama and his doctorate from Johns Hopkins University. Jones and his three brothers, Howard, Edwin, and Raymond, served in World War I and World War II; a fourth brother Carl served in World War II. During World War II, he was stationed in New Guinea and sent anthropological collections back to the Alabama Museum of Natural History. Jones's oldest son, Nelson Bolling Jones, was killed in Germany, April 2, 1945, fighting the German Army, but he lived to see another son, Douglas Epps Jones, become a professor of geology at the University of Alabama. His other son, Warren Phelps Jones, managed an electro- chemical manufacturing plant in Huntsville, until his retirement in 1994.

The method is now in widespread use in schools across the UK and the USA. In Scotland many primary schools use the method regularly and it is starting to be introduced into secondary schools. It is a special time to share fingerplays, chants and rhymes, songs, play rhythm instruments, read a story, and participate in movement games and relaxation activities. Circle time provides a time for listening, developing attention span, promoting oral communication, and learning new concepts and skills. It is a time for auditory memory, sensory experiences, socialization, and a time for fun. Circle time can be a complex, dynamic interaction among adults, children, and resources used. Teachers have the power to make group time more effective and enjoyable for all involved. It also has roots in social group work and in solution focused therapeutic approaches. Murray White was the first British author to publish a book on circle time and his Magic Circles raised the profile and popularity of circle time during the 80s. Jenny Mosley is credited with pioneering and popularising its use in schools, and other group environments. She says that industry used it \\"to overcome the gulf that can develop between management and the shop floor...the reputation for quality which Japan enjoys can be attributed largely to the widespread use of the approach\\". Circle time in the United States is a less formal program. Childcare centers often have one, two, or three group gatherings a day that are referred to as \\"Circle Time.\\" During this time, the children sit in a circle (usually on a rug) and the teacher may read a book aloud, lead a sing-along, or engage the children in a discussion. Circle times may start with an analysis of the weather and a correlation between the type of clothing that the children are wearing. Circle time is generally used for children ages 2‚Äì11. Organization The ideal number of people to be involved is between 6 and 18 because any more than that and it becomes difficult for everyone to take a full part in proceedings. An open circle is made of chairs or cushions (there should not be any tables or desks which could act as a barrier), allowing everyone to face each other clearly. Many schools also use a \`talking object\` to facilitate discussion. The talking object can be anything (a stuffed toy, a cushion or a decorated piece of wood or plastic). This talking object is then passed around the circle and only the person who has the talking object is allowed to speak. The teacher sits on the same type of chair or cushion as everyone else. This helps to signal that what is happening is a special kind of classroom activity in which the teacher is a facilitator rather than a director. The teacher has a special responsibility to make sure that structured rules of the Circle Time are kept, that everyone's emotions are protected and that suitable activities are prepared. The teacher must also be ready to draw a session to a close if students are persistently breaking the rules. Rules The most important thing about the rules for circle time is that they should be discussed and agreed by all members. This is one of the first activities that should take place. The three basic rules which should be discussed are: 1\\\\. One person speaks at a time 2\\\\. Everyone listens to the person speaking 3\\\\. They all have fun Quality Circle Time Quality Circle Time is a democratic and creative approach used to consider a wide range of issues affecting the whole school community and was developed primarily by Jenny Mosley in response to England's Primary schools' need for a whole school Behaviour Policy as a part of Personal, Social and Health Education. Quality Circle Time is based on the promotion of self- discipline and self-esteem. Students learn and understand the consequences of their behaviour and begin to take on responsibility for themselves and their immediate and wider community. This has been shown to gradually shift responsibility for discipline from the teacher to the children themselves. At the heart of the Circle Time Model is a class meeting which involves the whole class sitting in a circle to look at issues relating to personal, social, moral and health education. The circle meetings aim to encourage the development of positive relationships, self-discipline, conflict resolution, assertive communication and democratic group processes alongside the skills of speaking, listening, observing, thinking and concentrating. Circle Time follows a clear structure over half an hour: *Opening game: pulls the group together, provides a sense of fun and enjoyment, used to teach learning skills, moral values and codes of conduct *Round Table: gives everybody a chance to speak. A speaking object such as a conch can be used to enable a focus on the speaker and indicate that all others must listen. It is this section of Circle Time where scripted sentences are often used. Examples might include: I find it easiest to work in class when‚Ä¶I get fed up when... I was pleased with myself when... *Open Forum: an open, free discussion phase which can be used to discuss and solve problems and set targets *Celebration of successes: a chance for pupils to thank others, both children and adults, for acts of kindness etc. during the past week *Closing game: brings a sense of closure and bridges into the next part of the school day The structure is designed to build a sense of class community and the teacher acts as a non- authoritarian facilitator, encouraging co-operation and creating a climate of emotional safety. Problem solving Circle time can be used to help solve problems which have been identified by either the teacher or students. Issues and problems can be identified by brainstorming or by rounds such as, \\"the best thing about this school is...\\" and \\"the worst thing about this school is...\\". Then the idea is to make sure that if a real problem is identified at least one positive suggestion is agreed on before the session ends. (e.g. The teacher will arrange for Jack and Jill to have a meeting with the Principal/Headteacher to discuss the bathrooms). Games and activities can be engaged in and are designed to promote trust, respect, empathy and understanding which offers participants the security and freedom to explore issues and find ways forward. Evaluation and assessment opportunities As a well established model used in many Primary schools throughout the UK much evaluation has taken place on the effects of the model in schools. In addition to positive assessment by OFSTED, various studies have evaluated the impacts of the model, e.g. A report on the use of Circle Time in Wiltshire Primary Schools and A report on the use of Jenny Mosley's Whole School Quality Circle Time Model in Primary Schools in the UK (1999) commissioned by All Round Success Charity Headteachers have expressed concerns about lack of resources and training. They also emphasise the importance of the adult who conducts Circle Time. Without adequate training, the process can become diluted and ineffectual. In untrained or inexperienced hands, Circle Time can be disappointing or even destructive. At its worst, it can be misused by teachers to try and shame children publicly and coerce them into 'behaving'. Or, it can be simply mediocre, where it can become boring and repetitive. Furthermore, there is the danger of an appreciable gulf between the values demonstrated in Circle Time and the reality witnessed around the school in terms of teachers' attitudes towards each other or towards children. If this is so obviously apparent children can become demoralised and lose faith in the moral values. In many cases the school fails to act on the listening, i.e. they fail to incorporate many of the management issues raised by children into their subsequent action plans. Children can then become cynical and apathetic towards the process, detecting a divide between values and action and may come to see it as little more than another control mechanism. Much emphasis is placed on the mental health of adult teams in the school and on training. It is impossible to expect adults to respond positively, warmly and calmly if they themselves are emotionally and physically exhausted and /or lacking in team support. Effective training is seen as vital to the success of Circle Time. Measures include: *The introduction of the model at teacher training level *Local authorities (formerly LEA (local education authorities)) personnel and link advisors/inspectors attending an accredited Jenny Mosley Training course *Local authorities programmes involving a number of schools and/or whole school INSET (in-service education and training program) led by accredited Jenny Mosley Trainers. Demonstration circle time sessions involving a specialist and a group of children is often included as part of the INSET *Research suggests that headteachers consider on-going training an essential pre-requisite for the success of Circle Time and it is strongly advised that schools undergo a process of training from accredited trainers.

The Ch√¢teau de Beauregard is a Renaissance castle in the Loire Valley in France. It is located on the territory of the commune of Cellettes, a little south of the city of Blois and a few miles from other famous Loire ch√¢teaux such as Cheverny. Although still inhabited, it can be visited by tourists. The castle is renowned for its Gallery of portraits decorated in the 17th century with 327 portraits of famous people. History Most of the castle was built around 1545, when it was bought by Jean du Thiers, Lord of Menars, and Secretary of State to Henri II. The commissioned interior included frescoes on the fireplace of the royal chamber, which have survived. In the Great Gallery there is a fireplace in Italian style from this period. However its main feature was commissioned by Paul Ardier, Comptroller of Wars and Treasurer, who bought the ch√¢teau in 1617. He added further interior decorations over the next few decades, including a gallery of portraits. The castle is built on the edge of the Russy Forest. The ruins of a chapel, prior to the fifteenth century, are still visible in the park. It shows, in stone, shell of the pilgrims of Saint Jacques de Compostela and the motto of the crusaders \\"God wills it.\\" The original manor house was built in the late fifteenth century by the family Doulcet. Jean Doulcet, Master of the House of Coins of Duke Charles of Orleans. In 1495, Louis of Orleans (future Louis XII), erected in the land of Beauregard lordship, was authorized by Edict build a dovecote. The son of John Doulcet Francis, Master of the House to Deniers of Louis XII, was dismissed for defrauding the Crown during the Italian campaigns, and Beauregard then confiscated and incorporated into the royal domain. In 1521, Francis I, who used until the castle as a hunting rendezvous, offered it to his uncle Ren√© de Savoie, who died at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, and the area fell to his widow. In 1545, at a price of 2000 gold crowns, the estate was purchased by John Thier, Secretary of State for Finance for Henry II and a great humanist, protector of poets Joachim du Bellay and Pierre Ronsard. Jean Thier was the real builder of the castle. He incorporated the old house into the new building, built in the Renaissance style, the central gallery that connected the two residential building body. The architect is unknown. From 1553, Jean du Thier appealed to many foreign artists who were working for King Henry II to undertake the interior decoration,. The painter Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate decorated with frescoes in the destruction of the north wing of the nineteenth century. Joiner King Francisque Scibec Carpi carved woodwork of the study, the Cabinet of Bells. At the foot of the windows of the south wing, Jean du Thier created a typical Renaissance garden, strictly scheduled. He presented collections of rare plants meet the owner of the botanical tastes. The castle was designed and described in the book of Androuet Hoop, The most excellent buildings of France (Second Volume, 1579). Florimond Robertet took over Beauregard in 1566. On the death of Jean Thier in 1559, Catherine de' Medici appointed Robertet as Secretary of State for Finance. He undertook no developments to Beauregard, then being absorbed by the construction of his castle of Bury. The heirs of Florimond Robertet gave way to Paul Beauregard Ardier in 1617. The new owner of the castle had to withdraw from the service of Louis XIII after 55 years spent with the kings Henry III, Henry IV and Louis XIII. Controller General of War, Grand Treasurer of the savings, he was 72 years old when he devoted himself to embellish his new domain. He destroyed the old house to surround the central gallery of modern two symmetrical wings. It also gave the public their current appearance. The major work of Paul Ardier was the setting for the Portrait Gallery which also occupied the next two generations. His son, Paul Ardier, President of the Chamber of Accounts and the husband of his granddaughter, Gaspard de Fieubet, Chancellor of the Queen Mother Anne of Austria, continued his work. The land of Beauregard was built by Viscount Louis XIV. The domain of Beauregard left the Ardier wealth in 1816 to be sold to the Viscount of Pr√©val. The Comtesse de Sainte Aldegonde, born Adelaide Josephine Bourlon Chavagne, widow of the Duke of Castiglione, succeeded him to the castle. The October 8, 1839 his daughter, Marie-Josephine Valentine (1820-1891), married to Alexandre-Edmond de Talleyrand-P√©rigord castle, Duke of Dino and son of the Duke of Talleyrand; she became the mistress of wealthy Russian subject Anatole Demidoff, made Prince of San Donato in 1840 by ducal decree and ephemeral husband of Mathilde-Laetizia Bonaparte, daughter of Jerome prince and cousin of Napoleon III. In 1837 Virginia St. Aldegonde, Duchess of Mortemart, inherited from Tourzel Henriette, Duchess of Charost Castle Meillant (Cher), she was restored from 1842. In 1850, Jules, comte de Cholet (1798-1884), new owner, entrusted the restoration of the castle at the Jules Morandi√®re, and in 1864 it was classified a historic monument by Prosper M√©rim√©e and remained in his family for seventy-two years. In 1912, Louis Thillier launched a major modernization and restoration. The domain belongs since 1925 to the family of Gosselin from which the Count Guy of Cheyron Pavilion, which today continues the restoration of the castle and the gallery of portraits with his wife.  Description  The main building has two floors of the gallery: the ground floor is a covered porch gallery with seven arches and the first floor is a gallery. In the 16th century, the galleries were designed to connect the two residential buildings. On the south of it, at the right angles, there are advanced wings with two floors and a chimney that's tall and narrow decorated with stale inclusions. You would have to imagine the other side of the court, another wing, probably the body of the primitive home of the 15th century, including Jean du Thier during the constructing duration of the castle. This wing, visible on the plans of Androuet du Cerceau, was destroyed in the seventeenth century to make way for a more modern building that has disappeared in the 19th century. The rear facade overlooking the park was changed in the 19th century. It was abolished by the court of the tennis court to double the central building. Thus, the residential wings are no longer front and the back cover is decidedly more massive. The gallery of portraits Galeries des Illustres The gallery of portraits (Galeries des Illustres in French), the largest in Europe to have survived to our days, is the masterpiece of the castle : built during the first half of the 17th century at the request of Paul Ardier, it is 26 meters long, its pavement is entirely made of 5 500 Delftware tiles and its walls are decorated with 327 portraits of famous people having lived between 1328 (date of the beginning of the reign of Philippe VI of France) and 1643 (death of Louis XIII). The French kings are depicted accompanied by portraits of their queens, ministers, marshals, diplomats etc. Apart from French personalities, other important historical people of 25 nationalities are represented. Marie Ardier, daughter of Paul Ardier, committed the decoration of the ceiling to the painter Jean Mosnier and its family. The blue color which dominates has been obtained by the use of lapis lazuli, one of the most precious and expensive mineral stones in the 17th century. Paul Ardier, owner of Beauregard in 1617, realized in the whole gallery of his castle, a historian dream tell through a collection of portraits 315 years of history of France. 3 generations of his family have run for 60 years to design this exceptional piece. = Presentation = Located on the \\"noble floor\\", the gallery is 26 meters long by 6 meters wide. The collection, which is right around the room, includes 327 portraits on 3 levels in 12 panels. Each portrait painted on the canvas measures on average 55 cm by 45 cm. The characteristics are represented by 2 exceptions and . The large equestrian portrait of Henri IV de France is placed on the fireplace dated in the 16th century. The portraits of the 14 characters that surround it are significantly smaller than the entire collection. The ceremonial portrait of covers three levels of portraits. The number of portraits were variable depending on the king which they are associated. For example, the reign of Philippe IV has six portraits. Charles VIII has 21 portraits and Louis XIII de France has 40 portraits. The dates of the reigns concerned as well as the emblem and motto of King are painted on wood located between the ground and portraits. = Portrait Galleries, an Italian inspiration = The first collections of historical portraits appeared in Italy in the 17th century. Through the intellectual current of humanism revived the ancient interest to men who played a dominant role in the course of history. Many people who fascinated by the life and actions and also by the characteristics of the illustrious we tried to reflect closely as possible. The most famous Italian collections was that of Paul Jove bishop of Nocera gathers in his villa by Lake Como, set consisting of 240 paintings of political and artistic personalities who enjoyed a considerable impact in Europe. A copy of this collection, commissioned by the Medici, is now visible at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. In the late sixteenth century, the taste for portrait galleries spread in France. These collections have been dispersed or permanently lost the galleries such as Henry IV ordered the Louvre Richelieu in his Cardinal's palace (Palais Royal) . Both collections gathered political figures and announced the theme which was chosen for the Hall of Beauregard Illustrious. Beauregard Gallery is by no means an isolated initiative, it must be understood within a mode. However, since the seventeenth century, this collection was distinguished by his contemporaries: we find an admiring mention in the memoirs of the Grande Mademoiselle when he came to the castle in 1655. The excess of the project and the care taken in the realization of the book rendered the famous gallery since its creation, which remains today the largest collection of historical portraits of characters known in Europe . Visiting the Chateau de Richelieu (1630-1642) in early September 1663, Jean de La Fontaine noticed there a place he said \\"Lined with portraits For most about major / Like toilet mirrors ; / If we had had more time / Less haste , another interpreter, I would tell you what people . You can judge that it is not ye of little stuff : Richelieu Cardinal , Duke ( his nephew Armand -Jean Vignerot ) who inherited his name ; Admiral fire Breze (...) . The rest is full of kings and queens,lords, the great figures of France , then that is the history of the nation that cabinet. One guard had to forget all the people who have triumphed over kings ; it is the Mona Lisas , beautiful Agnes and those illustrious conquerors without Henri fourth that would have been invincible prince.\\" \\\\- Jean de La Fontaine Another collection of portraits are visible in France, but its theme and scale are very different; this is that which was gathered in the seventeenth century, the castle of Bussy- Rabutin in Burgund. Ernest de Ganay tells the Neuville castle in Gambais in 1939 a \\"curious royal portrait gallery\\", some attributed to students Clouet; consists of 192 leading figures in the history of France from Fran√ßois I to the 1789 Revolution, it would have been created in the eighteenth century by Francis Nyert. In the nineteenth century, in his castle of Azay-le-Rideau the Marquis of Biencourt contitua from 1830 a collection of 300 ancient effigies, which was promptly shown to the public; a notable part, acquired in public auction of the furniture of the house (1898) by one of their descendants, Montaigne Viscountess de Poncins, was bequeathed by her in 1939 at Mus√©e Cond√© Chantilly, where it is stored. = The portrait achievements = Between 1620 and 1638, Paul Ardier passed the command of the 327 portraits from a Paris art school. Some portraits of leaving groups have a unity of style to think they are the work of one artist. But no tables signature or trademark holder to identify the painter or the painting school in charge of the order. Following the tradition of portrait collections of Italian Renaissance, the picture is designed as a genuine historical document. The search of the safest iconographic sources was a key aspect of the work of Paul Ardier and its painters. The paintings are mostly copies made in other French and European galleries. Copyists Ardier Paul worked in various existing collections, for instance, that the Chateau de Selles-sur-Cher, near Beauregard where Philippe de Bethune had gathered a collection of historical portraits. It was in the Richelieu gallery at Palais Cardinal in 1635, the painting of Louis XIII was copied from the painting of Philippe de Champaigne. We recognize famous works such as Charles VII by Jean Fouquet, Marie de' Medici by Van Dyck or the Count of Olivares by Velasquez. About the characters of the oldest kingdoms, when pictorial representations did not exist, paint school students worked after medals, drawings but also by observing, in churches, funeral effigies and stained glass. This concern for fidelity to the physical resemblance was completed by careful identification of the characters. In the upper part of each portrait is the name and function of the illustrious. = Choice of chronology and characters = Paul Ardier formed his collection following a rigorous logic. As a statesman, he Axa his work on political history. Beauregard 's Famous are the characters who, by their actions, have influenced the political history of the kingdom of France. The temporal boundaries were strictly fixed: the timeline begins at the throne of Philip VI of France in 1328 and ends with the death of Louis XIII in 1643. Geographically, the project was not limited to domestic politics, France is systematically replaced in its European policy . The choice of characters depicted was the fruit of a long reflection for Paul Ardier. This was to illustrate the political life of the most comprehensive and representative as possible way. European dimension he gave to his gallery did not facilitate its task. = French and European Politics = Philip VI of France begins this history of France in 1328 when he ascended the throne following the so-called \\"cursed\\" Kings, marking the advent of the Valois dynasty and the beginning of the Hundred Years' War. Fourteen kings of France succeeded him, surrounded by influential politicians of their reign. Louis XIII completes the collection. He was the last king knew that Paul Ardier. In this unique course, we recognize the great counselors and ministers of the kings of France. In the panel dedicated to Louis XIII, Cardinal Mazarin succeeded Richelieu. The major warlords, as the constable and Joan of Arc, appear surrounded by their comrades. According to the alliances and wars throughout the European story unfolds. Kings and queens, emperors, popes, generals and ministers of Europe punctuate the gallery. 26 countries are well represented at the turn of the 327 portraits. Edward III of England is the first of seven rulers of England present. For feats, their generals, as the Black Prince and Talbot, take place in the gallery. In the hundred years war succeeded the Italian countryside. It is then the kings and dukes of Naples, Milan and Florence that appear near Charles VIII, Louis XII and Francis. Europe's sovereign draw three centuries of French diplomatic history: Spain, Austria, Hungary, Sweden ... Until the Turkish sultans of Murad I in Suleymaniye, testify to the Ottoman power. Twenty-one women are present in the collection. Queens of England or Spain, countries where women could exercise the power only six queens of France. Very few of them could get out of their role as mothers to exercise real political power. They appear in the gallery in their role as regent queens, only official political function accessible to women in France. Isabeau of Bavaria we can cross that ruled during the madness of Charles VI, Catherine de' Medici, Marie de' Medici and Anne of Austria. Mary appears to her young husband Francis II. It is identified as \\"Queen of France and Scotland.\\" = Room decor = The portrait collection is embedded in a true decorative casket; the decor of the room was to the extent of the collection. = Delftware = Paul Ardier the Younger, oversaw the laying of some 5,500 Delft tiles adorning the floor of the gallery. Ordered from the famous Dutch earthenware from Delft, the 150 square meters of tiles represent an entire army in working order. There are 17 body regiments in costume inspired Louis XIII engraving Jacques De Gheyn. This Delft earthenware pavement is the largest in the world. = The painted decoration = For the realization of the painted decoration, Ardier Marie and her husband Gaspard Fieubet, grandchildren Paul Ardier, spoke to Mosnier family, which you can admire the works at the Luxembourg Palace and the castle of Cheverny. Peter, son of Jean Monier represented the currencies and the emblems of the kings of France on the woodwork beneath portraits. The dominant color of the ceiling to the French, the blue was obtained with powdered lapis lazuli, one of the gems of the old regime . We then estimated the price to seven times that of gold. = Collection through the centuries = Paul Ardier son continued the work begun in the gallery by decorating a room adjoining tables corresponding to the reign of Louis XIV, but this collection, there is nothing left; only the entablature of the ceiling still bears the name and dates of the Sun King. The vigilance of the various owners of the castle and the celebrity of the gallery prevented the dispersion and alteration of the main collection. In 1834, Louis -Philippe I at Versailles created a historical museum \\" dedicated to all the glories of France.\\" On his orders, 89 paintings were copied to the Beauregard gallery to enrich the museum's collections to the glories of France. The restoration of all the paintings began in 1986 and continues to this day. = The cabinet of bells = This small room, fully sheeted oak woodwork, is in the tradition of Italian Studiolo. Originally, the workroom was connected to the Gallery through a small door sacrificed in the seventeenth century at the time of the establishment of the portrait collection. Jean Thier commanded the paneling of his study to the cabinetmaker Francisque Scibec Carpi. The Italian artist worked for Francis I at Fontainebleau, to the Louvre Henri II and Diane de Poitiers the Chateau d'Anet. The order date of 1554, the price remains unknown. Achieving the woodwork necessitated six months of work only. The coffered ceiling, pegged, is considered one of the finest in France. It consists of a large octagon surrounded by eight small hexagons finely carved. In its center, the ceiling carries the coat of arms of Jean Thier: \\"Azure three bells placed two on one\\" (three gold bells on a blue background). Jean Thier commanded indeed a very personal decor. The elements of its image are the major decorative features of the room. The friezes of bells that adorn the walls gave his nickname to the firm. In the upper part of the woodwork are embedded paintings by local artists from cartons Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate. Jean Thier surrounded himself in his study, his favorite activities: arts (painting, sculpture, literature, music and silverware) and more physical disciplines (art of war, hunting and tennis court). In the seventeenth century, Paul Ardier had busted the original fireplace. The coats of arms of his family adorn the amounts. A painting of Louis XIII on horseback adorned the fireplace until the early twentieth century. To overcome her disappearance in 1925, the family Gosselin commanded at the Louvre, a copy of the huntress Diana Francois Clouet. = The park = The park The walled castle park has 70 hectares; 40 hectares are the flower garden, the rest of the property is occupied by wood. = The Renaissance = Castle Jean Thier was a pleasure castle, remains a country facing its gardens. In 1551 Henry II gave to his minister and friend 1500 trees (oak, elm, beech, holly and hazel) to take in the royal forests. Jean Thier was known to his contemporaries as a lover and collector of rare plants. Beauregard garden was greeted in the sixteenth century, Androuet Hoop get echoed. In his book, The most excellent buildings in France, he spent three prints the castle and its grounds. The largest pavilion of the house looked a learned audience. It was a geometrically ordered garden, with many species of rare plants. He had the characteristics of the Renaissance garden: wooden galleries ending with small temples, a fountain in the center, using the box to delimit the parterres. Beauregard garden had a utilitarian purpose. From Jean Thier and plans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, we note the presence in significant number of fruit trees (cherry, plum, almond, walnut). The acres of vineyard were located along the south side. The vegetable garden was deep in the park, at the site of the current Jardin des Portraits. Everything remained embellished with architectural elements and alleys to combine business with pleasure. = The modern era = In 1617, the castle came into the heritage of the Ardier family. Paul Ardier The interest focused on interior design. He did not neglect the park either. Two years after his arrival in 1619, he closed the park walls. Buying new land, it radically changed the perspective of the castle. On the plans of Androuet Hoop, we see that the castle entrance was on the west side of the castle. Paul Ardier ordered the construction of a new driveway centered on the gallery. Along this line, the current path of honor, were planted fruit trees. The walled garden of Jean Thier was preserved, he adapted to the new gardens in the French fashion. In 1661, the documents attest to the existence of a building reserved for orange and in 1718, was raised a large body of which he remains today only half. An inventory of the early eighteenth century, counted 74 orange and lemon reflecting the real interest of Beauregard lords for their orangery. = The 19th century = Fashion landscaped gardens arrived in France in the late eighteenth century. In England, landowners were enthusiastic about all landscaping that preserved the natural appearance of sites. In France, one of the most successful examples of these gardens are landscaped gardens of the Petit Trianon at Versailles created for Queen Marie Antoinette . The eighteenth century also saw the appearance in France previously unknown species brought back from scientific expeditions in North America and the Middle East . Some of these rare species will enrich the Beauregard gardens like a cedar of Lebanon, the tulip tree magnolia grandiflora or. The author of the park to Beauregard Castle English is unfortunately not known. In the eighteenth century or the Empire, the English tradition supplanted the garden \\"to the French.\\" = The rehabilitation in the 20th century = In 1992, the park was listed as a historical monument. A major restoration work was then undertaken. Inspired by a Gilles Cl√©ment project, the Beauregard gardens evidence a concern to ensure the link between the past centuries and modern times. The various collections of trees and plants (oak, cedar, bamboo, decorative barks) are the direct descendants of the botanical likes of Jean Thier. Portraits of the garden or the recent renovation of the cooler demonstrate continuous innovation. Portraits of the garden was created in 1992 by Gilles Cl√©ment. Portraits of the garden consists of 12 portraits gardens recalling the 12 groups in the Castle Gallery. Protected by its high walls plant, garden or each \\"room\\" is a variation on a dominant color and a scholarly exercise of landscape gardening. More than 400 species of perennials and shrubs seem to evolve without any constraints. The color of the rooms can be symbolically associated with a character or an event recounted in the great gallery of the castle. For example, a red room is associated with blood of St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. The castle's ice-room was renovated during the winter 2007/2008. Dating from the seventeenth century, it shows an unknown technical heritage of the general public. These vessels were designed for ice storage and conservation throughout the year. The park has been designated as a \\"Remarkable Garden\\". = Expositions = Since 2010, this takes place every year, the Portrait of the International Exhibition, the third edition guest of honor Jean -Pierre Alaux. = See also = * Liste des ch√¢teaux de la r√©gion Centre = Notes and references = * Coordonn√©es v√©rifi√©es sur G√©oportail et Google Maps * ¬´ Notice no PA00098404 ¬ª [archive], base M√©rim√©e, minist√®re fran√ßais de la Culture * Lettres √† Mme de La Fontaine, dans Oeuvres compl√®tes de La Fontaine, tome VI, Paris, P.

Her husband was Juqu Mujian (Prince Ai). It is not known when she was created Princess Wuwei, either by her father or by her brother Emperor Taiwu, but in a move to ensure Juqu Mujian's loyalty, Emperor Taiwu married her to Juqu Mujian in 437, forcing Juqu Mujian to divorce his prior wife, Princess Li Jingshou. However, Juqu Mujian also carried on an affair with his brother's wife, Lady Li, and Lady Li and Juqu Mujian's sisters carried out a plot to poison Princess Tuoba. Emperor Taiwu, hearing that his sister had been poisoned, sent a number of doctors to the Northern Liang capital Guzang (ÂßëËáß, in modern Wuwei, Gansu), and they were able to save her. Emperor Taiwu demanded that Lady Li be turned over, but Juqu Mujian refused and sent Lady Li away instead. In 439, Emperor Taiwu conquered Northern Liang, and took Juqu Mujian as a captive to the Northern Wei capital Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé, in modern Datong, Shanxi), but because of Princess Wuwei's sake, continued to honor Juqu Mujian as a brother-in-law with the title Prince of Hexi.

It was formed in 1990 as a merger between three regional agricultural colleges. In 2012 it became part of Scotland's Rural College. The work of the SAC in education and training, research and development and consultancy services, is continued by the SRUC. History In 1899 the agricultural department of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College amalgamated with the Scottish Dairy Institute and formed the West of Scotland Agricultural College (WSAC). In 1900 WSAC was based in Blythswood Square, Glasgow. In 1927 the estate of the late John Hannah of Girvan Mains, at Auchincruive near Ayr, was given to the college and in 1974 the Blythswood Square site was closed. The Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture had premises at George Square, Edinburgh, which were enlarged in 1904.Dictionary of Scottish Architects - DSA Building/Design Report accessed 23 March 2012.

Formed in June 2006 by the merger of two companies, Axalto and Gemplus International. Gemalto N.V.'s revenue in 2018 was ‚Ç¨2.969 billion. Purchased by Thales Group in April 2019 and now operating as Thales DIS (Digital Identity and Security), Gemalto was until its acquisition the world's largest manufacturer of SIM cards. Thales DIS is headquartered in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and has subsidiaries and group companies in several countries. It has approximately 15,000 employees in 110 offices; along with 24 production sites, 47 personalization centers, and 35 R&D; centers in 47 countries.  History  In June 2006, smart card providers Gemplus and Axalto merged to become Gemalto (a portmanteau of the original company names.) Axalto was a Schlumberger IPO spin-off in 2004. Between the merger and 2015, Gemalto completed a series of acquisitions: the Leigh Mardon's personalization center (Taiwan), Multos International, NamITech in South Africa, NXP mobile services business, the mobile software solution provider O3SIS, Trusted Logic (the secure software platform provider), Serverside (personalization of bank cards with digital images generated by end users), XIRING's banking activity, Netsize (a mobile communications service and commerce enabler), Valimo Wireless, a provider in mobile authentication, the internet banking security specialist Todos AB in Sweden, Cinterion the German specialist of machine-to- machine (M2M), SensorLogic (an M2M service delivery platform provider), Plastkart in Turkey, Ericsson‚Äôs mobile payment platform IPX, the information security company SafeNet and Buzzinbees, the automatic SIM activation expert. =Axalto and Schlumberger= Schlumberger began its chip card activities in February 1979 when it licensed and marketed certain chip card technologies developed and patented by Roland Moreno, who is generally credited with the invention of the chip card. Schlumberger developed the first telephone chip cards for France Telecom and the Swedish telecommunications operator Telia in the early 1980s. The company developed ties with telecommunications operators in several countries, and played a role in industry-wide efforts to develop new digital mobile communication standards, particularly the GSM transmission standard (Global System for Mobile Communication). Schlumberger designed its first SIM card in the early 1990s for the launch of GSM in Europe, and this led to the use of microprocessor card technology as an access and security solution for mobile telephony worldwide, in 3 billion handsets today. In the early 1980s, the French banking sector decided to migrate from the magnetic stripe card-based payment system to a more modern and secure microprocessor card-based system. Schlumberger received its first contract in June 1981 to provide GIE Cartes Bancaires, the French credit/debit card issuers‚Äô association, with 5,000 microprocessor cards and 200 associated POS terminals. The microprocessor card-based payment system subsequently became standard in France and eventually led to a global standard known as EMV, set up by Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Schlumberger experienced internal and external growth since the launch of its chip card operations in the early 1980s through the 1990s and 2000s, both in terms of revenue and product portfolio, particularly with the substantial growth in GSM-based mobile telecommunications. Acquisitions of regional companies in card production and personalization included Cowells (United Kingdom), Malco (United States), Printer (Mexico) and Cardtech (Brazil), followed by Solaic in 1996 and Bull- CP8 from Bull in 2001, in France and China. In 2003, Schlumberger created Axalto as a division to consolidate into one company all of its card and POS terminal activities, which until then had been managed by several subsidiaries and joint ventures of the Schlumberger group. Subsequently, Axalto was listed on the Euronext Paris market on May 18, 2004. =Gemplus= Founded by Marc Lassus (among others), Gemplus started its operations in 1988 as a supplier of prepaid phonecards. Because of its presence in the market of the prepaid phonecards during the 1990s, the company developed ties with the telecommunications industry along with Schlumberger. Prior to 1999, the business was conducted through Gemplus S.C.A., a French limited partnership. In December 1999, Gemplus Associates, the general partner of Gemplus S.C.A., merged into Gemplus S.C.A., which became a joint stock company, Gemplus SA. In February 2000, the corporate structure was reorganized and a new holding company, Gemplus International SA, a Luxembourg corporation, was created. Texas Pacific Group became a shareholder of Gemplus at the time of its equity contribution in February 2000. In December 2000, the company completed an initial public offering of its capital stock, in the form of ordinary shares traded on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris, and ADSs traded on the U.S. NASDAQ exchange. In 2004, the company completed the planned reorganization of its corporate structure by transferring most of the subsidiaries of Gemplus SA to Gemplus International SA. In April 2005, Gemplus acquired Setec Oy, a company headquartered in Finland that, among other things, supplies conventional and electronic travel passports to various government agencies and products involving secure printing. In June 2006, smart card providers Axalto and Gemplus merged to become Gemalto. = Android patent lawsuit = In October 2010, Gemalto filed a lawsuit against Google, Samsung, HTC and Motorola over the Android operating system in the Eastern District of Texas. Gemalto said that Android phones had memory-utilization features that it had first developed and patented, and accused the defendant companies of infringing three of its patents. Ars Technica quoted ING analysts who estimated that winning this lawsuit could potentially bring the company royalty receipts amounting to 30-50 million Euros per annum.

Snowden stated that \\"When the NSA and GCHQ compromised the security of potentially billions of phones (3g/4g encryption relies on the shared secret resident on the sim), they not only screwed the manufacturer, they screwed all of us, because the only way to address the security compromise is to recall and replace every SIM sold by Gemalto.\\" The breach subsequently refueled suspicions against Gemalto chairman Alex J. Mandl, given his role in the CIA venture capital firm In-Q-Tel. GCHQ and NSA declined to comment on the matter.

Education Saks grew up in South Africa. His father was a first generation South African of Lithuanian descent. His mother was Scottish of Ukrainian extraction. He had an aunt who was an accomplished opera singer in South Africa but he had no interest in singing at first. He had originally wished to become an actor, dropping out of school at the age of sixteen because \\"I hated it\\". He auditioned for drama school at the Little Theatre under the direction of Mavis Taylor but was told he had to be eighteen for admission and they suggested he study singing in the meantime. He began his musical studies under Angelo Gobatto, the director of the opera school at the South African College of Music which is a department of the University of Cape Town.Stimpson, Mansel (2008). \\"The Time is Ripe: Gidon Saks and The Tales of Hoffman\\" on www.classicalsource.com. In order to avoid the military conscription which was mandatory for all white South African males at the time, he moved to the U.K. to study at the Royal Northern College of Music, after a year at opera school in Cape Town. While still a student at Northern College, he began drawing designs for college productions and these were used in Brecht/Weill's Happy End, Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Mozart's Don Giovanni and Berg's Wozzeck. Early career At the age of 22, at the urging of his voice teacher in Toronto, Patricia Kern, he debuted in Brian Macdonald's production of The Mikado at the 1982 Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada, which went on tour as well as being televised. With the Canadian Opera Company, he sang the role of Lord Rochefort in Donizetti's Anna Bolena, with Dame Joan Sutherland; Daland in Der fliegende Holl√§nder; Wurm in Luisa Miller; Bluebeard in Bluebeard's Castle and Boris Godunov.Conservatorium Hogeschool Gent He acknowledged in an interview that his performances at this early time in his career were sometimes less than polished. Nevertheless, his admiration for Kern borders on the religious in his own estimation, such was her inspiration and influence on his career. Switzerland As has been the case with many aspiring opera singers, the experience Saks gained by performing with some of the myriad small state-funded opera companies on the continent was invaluable. He earned a scholarship to the Zurich Opera Studio which led to a three-year contract at the Musiktheater im Revier in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Later he earned another three-year contract at the Bielefeld Opera in Bielefeld, Germany. While in Switzerland, he perfected his German and also added several Entartete Kunst roles to his repertoire.Intermusica During this time he began to receive engagements to sing in Berlin and he performed in the opening concert in the Berliner Festwochen (Berlin Festival) in C√©sar Franck's Beatitudes under the direction of Vladimir Ashkenazy. Designing and directing As well as designing the production, he directed Giovanni Paisiello's Il Barbiere di Siviglia at the Gatti√®res Festival in France, and as a free-lancer has designed four operas for the Scottish Opera, Glasgow where he also produced and directed Maurice Ravel's L'enfant et les sortil√®ges and Puccini's La boh√®me. Later he was responsible for the successful design and direction of the premier of Le Grand Macabre by Gy√∂rgy Ligeti in Vienna. He also directed Georges Bizet's Carmen, Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te with the Berlin Opera Academy. Repertoire He has sung at the Royal Opera House where he made his debut in 1995 as Flint in Billy Budd, the Op√©ra National de Paris, the San Francisco Opera, the Berlin State Opera, the Houston Grand Opera, the Teatro Real in Madrid, the New York City Opera, at La Monnaie in Brussels, the English National Opera, Welsh National Opera, Scottish Opera, New Israeli Opera, and the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve. He has also been heard at the KlangBogen Festival in Vienna. Recent years have included the roles of Hagen (G√∂tterd√§mmerung) for Seattle Opera and in London for English National Opera, Pizarro (Fidelio) and Kaspar (Der Freisch√ºtz) for the Deutsche Staatsoper, Philip II (Don Carlos) in Geneva and Palermo, Boris Godunov (title role) in London and Toronto, Claggart (Billy Budd) in Paris and London, Nick Shadow (The Rake's Progress) in London, Daland (Der fliegende Holl√§nder), Kochubei (Mazeppa) for Welsh National Opera, Hunding (Die Walk√ºre), Hagen (G√∂tterd√§mmerung), and Scarpia (Tosca) for Washington National Opera, and the 4 villains (The Tales of Hoffmann) at the Royal Opera House.

Influences In an interview, Saks spoke about his early love of Leontyne Price's sound, as well as being impressed with Franco Corelli, Brigitte Fassbaender and \\"inevitably\\" Maria Callas. He was helped greatly in his development by his voice teacher at Northern College, John Cameron, as well as Patricia Kern who encouraged him to go out and audition while he was still a student in Canada. More recently, after his voice was damaged in a Wagnerian role (Der Fliegender Hollander), he sought out voice teacher Susanna Eken of whom he said, \\"It's fair to say that she rescued me, not so much because my voice was a mess but because my confidence had gone\\". Recordings Recordings include the title roles in Handel's Saul and Hercules, Claggart (Billy Budd), Apollyon and Lord Hate-Good (The Pilgrim's Progress, Ralph Vaughan Williams). He has also appeared in film versions of Anna Bolena and The Mikado.

APP asked the Government of Pakistan for financial support, which was granted in the form of loans and subsidies. Government support enabled APP to subscribe to the services of the world's news agencies and to open offices in major cities of Pakistan. =Government takeover= Since its inception after the independence of Pakistan, APP was being run under a trust. The financial situation of APP continued to deteriorate until it was on the verge of collapse. This was a direct result of the withholding of payment of funds from the Government of Pakistan due towards APP from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in an effort to create a financial crisis for the national news agency. In the early 1960s, APP owed about Rs. 8 lakhs (Rupees 800,000) to the government's Post and Telegraph Department and another Rs. 12 lakhs (Rupees 1200,000) in unpaid subscription fees to foreign news agencies. The Government of Pakistan intervened and took over the agency on 15 July 1961 following the instructions of certain vested interests within the Government of Pakistan. A government ordinance was issued for it. The given reason was to strengthen APP's financial foundation. The takeover took place with several changes: Malik Tajuddin was removed and A K Qureshi, a senior government officer with some journalistic experience, was hired as Administrator of APP. The head office of the agency was shifted to Islamabad, the new capital of Pakistan. While the financial position of the agency further deteriorated, its coverage became more biased as the government started to use it as an official mouthpiece. A K Qureshi was a member of the ill-fated National Press Trust delegation traveling to London by PIA Flight 705 that crashed at Cairo on 20 May 1965. He is buried in a mass grave at Cairo alongside his fellow passengers: victims of Pakistan's first jet aircraft disaster.From the past pages of Dawn: 1965: Fifty years ago: 122 die in air disaster Dawn (newspaper), Published 21 May 2015, Retrieved 2 August 2019 In 2015, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid and a three member committee had conducted interviews of 18 candidates for the position of Managing Director of Associated Press of Pakistan to be able to finally appoint a Managing Director. Editorial operation Besides its head office in Islamabad, APP maintains five bureaus at Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar Quetta and Rawalpindi and seven news centres at Sukkur, Multan, Quetta, Faisalabad, Larkana, Hyderabad, Muzaffarabad and now Gilgit-Baltistan . The editorial function of any news agency is the same as that of a newspaper i.e. it is divided between reporting teams and the news desk. In smaller centres, the editorial staff consists of a reporter and sub-editor. The reporting team is composed of about reporters, responsible for specific beats such as economy, sports, crime, national and provincial assemblies or major government departments. These news desks are responsible for copy-writing and for coordinating activities of the reporting team. They also handle press releases of government information and private organisations including national and international NGOs, embassies and foreign missions The whole news operation is monitored by a Central News Desk (CND) located at the head office in Islamabad. News stories, features, write-ups from all bureaus are sent to Islamabad for editing and from there the combined service is distributed nationally. The CND is connected with foreign news agencies, local and foreign newspapers, government entities, TV channels, Radio via an internet. =Communication networks= Despite APP being considered Pakistan's \\"premier\\" news agency, for decades the agency ran on old, obsolete and unreliable equipment. News copy was being carried on a 50-baud duplex circuit between Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore. M. Aftab, APPs General-Manager in 1991, undertook to improve the agency's technical resources. The resulting upgrade saw a transformation of data output speed from 50 words per minute (WMP) to 1200 WPM, most of which is now directly fed into the computers of the subscribers simultaneously throughout Pakistan and overseas. =Subscribers= Being the national news agency of Pakistan, APP collects and disseminate domestic and international news to 84 (1992) newspapers of Pakistan besides radio, television and government offices and some foreign media. APP‚Äôs subscription rates are higher than other agencies in Pakistan, due to its credibility and services. For this reason every newspaper in Pakistan tries to subscribe to its services. Notable newspaper subscribers to APP's services include: Dawn, Pakistan Times, Frontier Post, The Statesman, The Nation, The News International, Business Recorder, The Observer, The Post and Nawa-i-Waqt, Jang, Khabrain, Daily Express (Urdu newspaper), The Express Tribune and some other English and Urdu national newspapers. =Staff= The number of APP's employees is estimated at between 800 and 1000, of whom over 200 to 350 are journalists and photographers while the rest are administrative staff, including computer engineers, technicians, peons, traffic attendants, data entry operators and finance staff. In addition there are a small number of \\"stringers\\" (part-time correspondents) at various district headquarters in Pakistan and aboard. After decades gap the system of journalists posting aboard was revived during the first tenure of Mr. M. Aftab. He secured approval of the Ministry to post four senior journalists as special correspondents in Washington D.C., London, Beijing and New Delhi. The massive political induction by Musharraf government's Information Minister Muhammad Ali Durrani and subsequently by PPP-led democratic government at federation from 2008 up till now (October 2015) have badly affected the financial position of APP. The organisation is unable to pay medical, telephones, newspapers bills, over time, feature and other allowances. The very unfortunate thing was that the backbone of the organisation are journalists but they are very less in number as compare to other staff members of the entity. Management and financing APP is a government organisation, responsible to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The agency is headed by a Director-General, appointed by the Ministry. Also it has a Managing Director (MD) of APP, appointed by the government. Since the government takeover, APP has continued with an undefined status ‚Äì neither an official government body nor an independent news outfit, APP has drawn criticism as a mouthpiece for the government of the day. In 1998, however, a Bill was proposed to convert APP into a corporation. On 19 October 2002 an Ordinance converted APP into a corporation and renamed it Associated Press of Pakistan Corporation (APPC). Due to this unclear status, there is no long-term financing in place for APP, with allocations being made on an annual basis by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. APP‚Äôs annual expenditure is now placed at Rs. 140 million. APP generates 60% of its revenue from the government, and the remainder is raised through subscription from electronic media including television and radio and newspapers as well as foreign news agencies, business and non-media subscribers. Services provided by APP =News service= Pakistan has two major news agencies: Associated Press of Pakistan and Pakistan Press International.Pakistan's two major news agencies on GoogleBooks Retrieved 3 August 2019 The APP News Service is mainly divided into three main areas: official, political and district news. Official news APP provides detailed coverage of the activities and statements of government dignitaries. Newspapers and the government-controlled radio and television rely heavily on APP for government news. According to renowned journalist Zamir Niazi: :\\"Most of the time and energy of APP since the days of Ayub Khan is being consumed in creeding long speeches of the president and other ministries, the rest are allocated to the government press notes and other lesser government functionaries.\\" Political & Other news Being the government agency, APP mainly focuses on government news, besides promoting cultural, social, economic and other sectors of national life. The organisation is well known for its credibility, as being a state owned news agency it has to demonstrate it indeed. APP also gives coverage to opposition leaders and parties in center and at provincial level but keeping in view its policy and as allow by the federal government. District news APP's district news service is not highly regarded, as its resources are so thinly placed across the country that most of the information from this department comes from government information officers. =Foreign news= APP has become the main source of international news for the Pakistani media. The agency subscribes to Reuters, AFP, and the Associated Press of America (AP). United Press International was also linked with APP, but the agreement was allowed to lapse. APP has co-operation agreements with some 35 news agencies, mainly in third world countries. Under these agreements, news is exchanged on a barter basis. Prominent among these are the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), the Press Trust of India, and MENA (Egypt). =Commercial service= The commercial service of APP provides currency and commodity rates from Reuters, financial and economic services, banks and large business houses. APP planned to expand this service, but suffered a setback in the mid-1980s when Reuters bypassed APP and began to sell its financial services directly to business houses and newspapers in Pakistan. =Photo service= APP has its own photographic section equipped with photo receivers and photo transmitters in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Quetta respectively. Islamabad is the head office to receive photographs from within Pakistan and aboard, and transmits them to the agency's bureaux and stations which distribute them to local newspapers. =Urdu service= The agency‚Äôs Urdu language service started in the 1980s to cater for the needs of the growing number of Urdu language dailies in Pakistan. The idea behind the setting-up of the service was to avoid errors and ensure accuracy. As a practice, Urdu speech was often translated into English by the APP and then back into Urdu by newspaper editor ‚Äì greatly increasing the chances of translation, emphasis or context errors. The Urdu Service, while still small, has been effective in producing text in both languages. Feature & Write Up Service APP editorial staff regularly contribute English and Urdu feature and write ups on socio-economic issues including education, health, business which are well carried by national dailies.Featured article provided by the Associated Press of Pakistan on The Express Tribune (newspaper) Retrieved 3 August 2019 Video News Service The Visual News Service (VNS)was launches during 2007 with a special focus to provide electronic news coverage of President, Prime Minister, Parliament House to private media national and international channels The project was initiated on an idea to launch APP's own news channel but financial restraints have hindered the idea and confined it to VNS service only.

She first appeared on-screen during the episode broadcast 31 January 2000. She last appeared on 1 December 2003. The character arrived as part of the Warrington/Scott family and has been labeled a \\"serial adulterer\\" due to her many affairs. Arriving with husband Andrew Warrington (Simon Cook), she has an affair with his son Luke Warrington (Royce Cronin). She is unfaithful to Luke with her ex-husband Adrian Scott (Ariyon Bakare) and later Jim Webb (Jo Dow). Nikki later finds love once again and marries Roy Farmer (Miles Petit). Her affair with Luke earned her the title of the \\"wicked stepmother\\" from Soaplife magazine. Development =Characterisation= A writer from five.tv described Nikki as one to always cause controversy. She is equally loved and hated by her neighbours for her behaviour. She is also the peacemaker and always there to mediate her children's many arguments. The wardrobe department kitted Nikki out with a plain dress code. Blake told Susan Riley of Soaplife that \\"Nikki's clothes are slowly getting trendier but she's very dowdy. When I used to see how frumpy I looked on-screen, I'd hotfoot it down to wardrobe and try to lose a few of her outfits.\\" When Blake first joined the show she was styling a shorter hair cut. But while filming her hair would drop over her face and Blake believed it made Nikki look like a muppet. =Affair with Luke= Nikki arrives in Charnham with her children Becky Scott (Chandra Reugg) and Darren Scott (Joe Fox). She is accompanied by her husband Andrew Warrington (Simon Cook) and his grown up children Sara Warrington (Beth Cordingly) and Luke Warrington (Royce Cronin). Though an attraction develops with the latter and they begin an affair. Blake defended her character's actions by noting that Nikki only ever acted on her feelings for Luke following alcohol consumption. Nikki's ex-husband Adrian Scott (Ariyon Bakare) is introduced into the show and he learns of their affair. Blake told Diana Hollingsworth from Soaplife that \\"Nikki can't bear for the children to find out that she slept with Luke. She doesn't want to decimate the family set-up she's worked so hard to create. And Andrew is very much part of that package.\\" Adrian uses his knowledge of the affair into forcing her to let him take Becky and Darren away. But Blake explained that Nikki believes that Adrian will not be able to support them and will return them home. She then blames their departure on Andrew's family problems. But the deceit and her children's absence proves too much for the character. Blake stated \\"She's blown to pieces, utterly destroyed [...] Nikki is distraught. She keeps breaking down and is finding it very hard to hold everything together.\\" Becky is miserable living with Adrian and runs away to visit Luke at university. Nikki goes to collect her but ends up sleeping with Luke despite the trouble their affair already created. This was because the duo have a \\"strong sexual chemistry\\". Blake also believed that Nikki had fallen in love with Luke. But she remains determined to stay with Andrew. Blake reasoned that \\"It would blow the family apart completely. He's a very straight guy ‚Äì I don't think he could envisage a bigger betrayal. It couldn't be worse.\\" Andrew begins to suspect an affair when he returns from an American lecture tour. He is suspicious of Adrian taking the children and demands answers. Nikki lies to Andrew claiming she has been unfaithful with a colleague. Andrew is angry with Nikki but also willing to save their marriage. Cook told Alison James of Soaplife that \\"he still loves Nikki and wants to make a go of things. But he doesn't make it easy for her. there's no way he intends to just forgive and forget.\\" Luke confesses to Sara that he is Nikki's lover. However Sara realises that Nikki will continue sleeping with Luke and makes sure Andrew catches them having sex. Cook believed that it was the ultimate betrayal from his wife and son. The shock leaves him numb and devastated. Andrew blames Nikki and believes that she corrupted her own son for an affair. Cook added that Nikki \\"completely abandoned her responsibilities\\". Cook thought that Nikki's reasons for wanting to remain with Andrew were selfish. He added \\"Nikki's desperate to save it, probably because she'll lose everything ‚Äì a sizeable income and her kids.\\" Cook said there was no hope of Nikki and Andrew repairing their relationship. Producers decided to write Andrew out of the show. They realised that Andrew could not live on the same street as Nikki. =Affair with Adrian= Nikki faces trouble at home when her son Darren (Ike Hamilton) refuses to accept her relationship with Luke. He decides to behave rudely and hope it pushes Nikki closer to Adrian. His plan succeeds when Nikki comforts Adrian after he decides to search for a man who sexually assaulted him. The emotional moment results in them sleeping together. Blake told James that \\"Nikki's fond of Adrian, but she's moved on and regards him as a kind of brother. She ended up making love with him because it felt kind of normal.\\" Blake said that Nikki views it as a one off because it did not rekindle her old feelings for Adrian. But Adrian presumes that they can become a family again. Blake said that her character worries and wants to stop Adrian from believing they have a future. Though Blake noted that Luke did not play a part in her decision to rebuff Adrian. She believed that Nikki and Luke did not work as a couple. It is a fantasy for Nikki, they have no future and she does not see him as a father figure. Blake believed that Luke would have been ideal for Nikki when she was younger, but she chose to be a mum instead. Blake came to the conclusion that her character needed to live her lost adolescence to finally grow up. She added that she is \\"trying to relive her lost youth. I'd like to see her hand the kids over to Adrian for a while and get those wild oats out of her system once and for all!\\" Luke soon discovers Nikki and Adrian's affair. Reception Hollingsworth branded Nikki \\"Charnham's wicked stepmum\\" for sleeping with Luke. While she later added \\"Nikki Warrington gave the term 'wicked stepmother' a whole new meaning when she fell into the arm's of her husband Andrew's son.\\" Their colleague Alison Riley said that Nikki's life was a \\"right mess\\". A reporter from the Birmingham Mail said that Nikki had a confusing \\"tangled love life\\" which was made worse by sleeping with Adrian.

Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on March 11, 1950, and stars Bugs Bunny. Plot Bugs wakes up after a long night to find that a burly construction worker (whom Bugs derisively dubs \\"Hercules\\") has just shoveled up his rabbit hole near a highrise building being built. Bugs kindly asks Hercules to put his hole back, and Hercules pretends to comply, before he dumps Bugs and the dirt into the dump truck. Bugs angrily shouts \\"Hey, you big gorilla! Didn't you ever hear of the sanctity of the American home?\\" before another mound of earth falls on him and the truck hauls him away. When Hercules exits the crane, Bugs calls him from the building under construction (\\"Yoo hoo! Hercules! Here's a message for ya!\\") dropping a brick on him (along with a telegram labeled \\"Eastern Onion\\" reading \\"Okay Hercules... You asked for it... Bugs Bunny\\"), then a steel girder, and then plays with the elevator controls while Hercules is inside the elevator. He accidentally breaks the controls, causing the elevator to fly off, and Hercules to fall into a pile of wet concrete. Bugs then impersonates the project engineer and orders Hercules to make a high brick wall, followed by several attachments. Once done, Hercules is trapped at dizzying heights on a teeterboard. As Bugs removes the bricks from one end, Hercules on the other end strips off his clothes to save weight. This only works temporarily; by the time Bugs removes the last brick, Hercules is down to nothing but his underwear. Hercules takes the fall, but suddenly manages to knock Bugs out temporarily with a steel girder, causing Bugs to dumbly \\"sleepwalk\\" through a harrowing series of moving girders and other objects. He finally regains his senses when he falls into a barrel full of water, then witnesses his nemesis bullying a shy employee, swiping his lunch and ordering him back to work. Infuriated, Bugs decides to put the goon out of commission once and for all (\\"Action, he says? Action he shall get.\\"). Appropriating a red-hot rivet with pliers, Bugs takes a look at the posted floor plans for the building and finds his mark. He releases the rivet down a hole; it bounces around through an elaborate maze of objects and finally lands and burns through a rope holding up a giant steel casing which falls on top of Hercules (who echoes Candy Candido's radio catchphrase, \\"I'm feelin' mighty low\\"). Bugs' ultimatum: \\"Do I get my home back or do I have to get tough?\\" prompts Hercules to finally wave the white flag in defeat. The next shot is of the finished skyscraper, with a slight indentation in the middle. At the bottom, Bugs sits in his hole - the building has been built around it - and declares: \\"After all, a man's home is his castle.\\" Cast Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny John T. Smith as Hercules (uncredited) Alternate edits Some television broadcasts omit the shot of Bugs dropping a brick on Hercules' head.

Originally built as the official residence and guest house of the British High Commissioner in Malaya, it is now owned by the Government of Malaysia. The name is a composite of the two colonial mansions located on the compound: the residence, named Carcosa (completed in 1898), and the guest house, now named Seri Negara (1913). The buildings figured prominently in the Malaysian independence movement, with several meeting held there. Since Independence in 1957, it has been used as residences for visiting dignitaries (1957‚Äì1989), and as a luxury hotel (1989‚Äì2015). Since 2017, it has been used as a museum. Design Carcosa Seri Negara refers to two buildings, the larger Carcosa and the smaller (and newer) Seri Negara (or King's House). =Carcosa= The Carcosa mansion was built in 1896‚Äì1897 as the official residence of Sir Frank Swettenham, the first British High Commissioner of the then Resident-General of the Federated Malay States. It was designed by Arthur Benison Hubback under instruction from the State Engineer of Selangor Public Work Department Charles Edwin Spooner, and sometimes also credited to Arthur Charles Alfred Norman. According to a letter he wrote in 1936, Swettenham chose the name Carcosa as a portmanteau of two Italian words, cara and casa, intended to mean \\"desirable dwelling\\". =Seri Negara= Seri Negara ('Beautiful Country' in Malay), was originally known as the Governor's Residence when it was opened in 1913 as the official guest house of Governor of the Straits Settlement. It was later known as the King's House. History =Colonial Malaya= Swettenham moved into Carcosa during construction, and the official housewarming party was not held until August 28, 1898. During World War II, the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army occupation government of Malaya were at Carcosa Seri Negara. The Constitution of Malaysia was drafted in Seri Negara between 1955 and 1957. The Federation of Malaya Agreement was signed on August 8, 1957 at King's House, and the property was then vacated by the British High Commissioner on August 31, 1957, when it was returned to the Malayan Government. It was then opened as the Istana Tetamu (Guest's Palace), hosting many visiting dignitaries, including Queen Elizabeth II in 1986. =Post-independence= With Malayan independence imminent in September 1956, the Chief Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, presented the deeds of Carcosa and its of land to the British Government as a gift, a token of goodwill. He moved a resolution in the Federal Legislative Council which read, \\"That this Council approve of the proposal to make a free gift of the house and buildings known as \\"Carcosa\\", together with the gardens and land attached, as a token of the goodwill of the Malayan people to Her Majesty's Government, for use as the residence and office of the future representative of that government in an Independent Federation.\\" Carcosa then became residence to a succession of post-independence diplomatic British High Commissioners. The Carcosa \\"issue\\" was taken up by young radical politicians, in particular Anwar Ibrahim and Mahathir Mohamad, his mentor. Tun Daim Zainuddin successfully led the campaign for the Malaysian government to own it, yet again. In 1987, possession of the Carcosa estate was returned to the Government of Malaysia. =Hotel= Soon after the acquisition of the estate, the Malaysian government proceeded to repurpose the estate into a hotel, which opened in 1989, by leasing the estate to hospitality companies: first to Malaysia-based Landmark Hotels and Realty from 1989 to 2010 and then to Saujana Hotels & Resorts (the hospitality subsidiary of Malaysia-based Peremba Group) from 2010 to 2016. From 2004 to 2010, Singapore-based General Hotel Management managed day-to-day operations. The lease was set for a renewable 10-year term. Carcosa and the Guest's Palace both served as hotels, with the latter rebranded as Seri Negara. Marketed as a luxurious heritage boutique hotel, much of the mansions' colonial architecture and interior designs were preserved, carefully adapted, and complemented with colonial-themed hotel service. In its inaugural year as a hotel, Carcosa Seri Negara served as the temporary official residence for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip when the 1989 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was held in Kuala Lumpur. By 2000, Carcosa was subdivided into seven suites, and Seri Negara held six more, each with a personal butler. After the lease for the estate was officially transferred from Landmark to Saujana in December 2010, only Seri Negara resumed operation as a hotel, carrying the Carcosa Seri Negara brand on its own. Carcosa was largely vacated, confined to limited uses, and had been reported to receive only basic maintenance. After the expiry of Saujana's lease in December 31, 2015, the hotel was entirely closed for business and the estate was placed under the safekeeping of the property and land management division of the Prime Minister's Department. Plans have been made to assign management of the buildings to the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, with a currently undetermined hospitality company conducting day-to-day operations. The Logo The Carcosa Seri Negara Logo was designed by Johan Design Associates (JDA) in 1989. The Logo was derived from metaphors (involving natural elements, environment, humanity, charm and beauty etc.), in this case a swan, are quite common, especially in the hospitality-related outlets, exotic resorts, nature‚Äôs goodness, romance and gender-enhanced branding, where specific nuances are drawn into play. It exude perceptions of warm hospitality, sense of wellbeing, nature‚Äôs exuberance, high society living and dining. Afternoon Tea One of Carcosa Seri Negara's trademarks was the English afternoon tea, served in the elegant drawing room, or on the charming wrap-around verandah, overlooking the beautiful gardens. It was served daily. =Museum= In April 2017, the Asian Heritage Museum signed a lease to rent Carcosa Seri Negara. In popular culture * Scenes for The 7th Dawn were filmed at Carcosa Seri Negara. * The residence appeared in an episode of The Amazing Race: All-Stars, in which competing teams checked into a \\"Pit Stop\\" on the property. * The 2018 film Crazy Rich Asians filmed scenes set at the ancestral Young mansion, named Tyersall Park, based on the former estate in Singapore of the same name, at the then-abandoned Carcosa Seri Negara. * Carcosa Seri Negara serves as the residences of the Blacketts and Mr Webb in the television production of The Singapore Grip.

Built and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, it is also used for wildlife management and recreation. Several parks are located along its shoreline, including Wilson State Park. History The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation authorized construction of Wilson Lake for the purposes of irrigation, navigation enhancement, flood control, recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, and water quality assurance. However, the salinity of the water in the Saline River, which would feed the reservoir, made using it for irrigation unfeasible. The Bureau then turned over management and operation of the project to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps of Engineers planned, designed, and constructed Wilson Dam, completing it in 1964 at a cost of $20 million, and continues to manage the reservoir to the present day. Geography Wilson Lake is located at (38.9401464, -98.5567638) at an elevation of . It lies in north-central Kansas in the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. Most of Wilson Lake lies in Russell County with a small portion of its southeastern arm extending into Lincoln County. The reservoir is impounded at its northeastern end by Wilson Dam. The dam is located at (38.9666777, -98.4947876) at an elevation of . The Saline River is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the west and outflow to the east. Smaller tributaries include Elm Creek, which flows from the south into the western part of the reservoir, and Hell Creek, which feeds the reservoir's southeastern arm. Kansas Highway 232 runs generally north-south along the reservoir's eastern shore and across the top of Wilson Dam. Shoreline Road, a paved county road, runs generally east-west parallel to the southern shore, crossing the reservoir's southeastern arm. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Corps of Engineers vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and the reservoir is considered full when filled to the capacity of its multi-purpose pool. When full, Wilson Lake has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Since the reservoir's initial flooding, sedimentation has gradually accumulated on the reservoir bottom thus raising its elevation. Infrastructure Wilson Dam is an earth-fill embankment dam with a foundation of rock and soil. It stands tall and long. At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . An uncontrolled, spillway is located at the southeast end of the dam. The dam's outlet works consist of one gated conduit wide and long. When the reservoir is filled to maximum capacity, the spillway has a discharge capacity of . When it is filled to flood control capacity, the outlet works conduit has a discharge capacity of . Management The Kansas City District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages Wilson Dam, Wilson Lake, and of land surrounding the reservoir for the purposes of flood control, recreation, fish and wildlife management, and downstream water quality improvement. Corps staff maintain the dam and outlet works, conduct dam safety inspections, and make water release changes to the Saline River outflow in accordance with the Kansas City Water District Control Section. They also provide visitor assistance, conduct park maintenance and patrolling, and perform wildlife food plot management. Operations such as trash removal, fee collection, and facility cleaning are outsourced to private contractors. Of the land surrounding Wilson Lake, the Corps directly manages and has licensed the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) to manage of native prairie and cropland as the Wilson Wildlife Area. Management activities include prescribed burning, tree and native grass plantings, invasive species control, and agricultural leases. Fisheries management activities include fish sampling and stocking, population monitoring, habitat work, and aquatic vegetation enhancement. Parks and recreation The Corps of Engineers manages three parks at Wilson Lake: Lucas Park, Minooka Park, and Sylvan Park. Lucas Park is located on the north shore of the reservoir's eastern end and includes the Rocktown Natural Area. Minooka Park, named after the Otoe word for \\"good earth\\", lies on the south shore of the central part of the reservoir. Sylvan Park lies below Wilson Dam immediately northeast of the reservoir. Both Lucas Park and Minooka Park host swimming beaches and boat ramps. All three parks include hiking trails and camping facilities. The Corps of Engineers also operates a visitor center located below Wilson Dam near Sylvan Park. The KDWP operates Wilson State Park located on the south shore of the reservoir's eastern end. The park is divided into two areas by the reservoir's southeastern arm: the Hell Creek Area on the west side and the Otoe Area on the east side. The Hell Creek Area hosts a marina. Both areas include hiking trails, swimming beaches, boat ramps, and camping facilities. Wilson Lake is open to sport fishing. Hunting is permitted on the public land around the reservoir although it is restricted in certain areas. =Points of interest= Rocktown Natural Area is a site comprising in Lucas Park. It is named for the sandstone pillars, ranging in height from to , that occupy its landscape. It is also home to a number of plant species uncommon to the region: Fremont's clematis, shortstem spiderwort, and Maryland senna among others. Portions of the Dakota Formation are exposed in multiple locations around the reservoir. They contain extensive fossil material dating back to the Cretaceous period. Wildlife Fish species resident in Wilson Lake include black bass, channel catfish, crappie, smallmouth bass, striped bass, walleye, and white bass. Two invasive species, the white perch and the zebra mussel, live in the lake as well. Game animals living on land around the reservoir include common pheasants, deer, ducks, geese, prairie chickens, quail, rabbits, and turkeys. Part of the Wilson Wildlife Area at the far western end of the lake is home to a concentration of several native mixed grass prairie species: big bluestem, blue gramma, buffalo grass, Indian grass, little bluestem, sideoats gramma, and switchgrass.

The story spans the title character's junior, or eleventh grade, year in high school. Plot summary The novel begins with the return of Betsy's childhood friend Thelma (Tib) Muller, who had been living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin since her parents were independent and they wanted to return to their old life, and the departure of Betsy's older sister, Julia, for college at the University of Minnesota. Julia's desire to bypass college and begin a musical career cause her to be relatively uninterested in classes and to focus instead on her desire to join a sorority. Excited by her sister's stories of college life, Betsy and her friends Tacy and Tib join with five other girls in establishing a local sorority at the high school level. Over time, Betsy finds that the social whirl of the sorority distracts her from her studies and also eventually causes a backlash of resentment among the rest of the student body, which leads to her group's being excluded from their usual leading role in school activities. Moreover, the exclusiveness of the sorority concept pushes away others she would like to welcome into her social circle. Julia likewise becomes less interested in sororities after she is temporarily blackballed for having attracted the romantic attentions of a man who had dated other sorority members. By April, both girls have decided against sorority membership -- Betsy in order to have a wider circle of friends and Julia to have the long- awaited chance to travel abroad and begin her musical training in earnest. The novel also revisits a theme from the previous novel in the series, Betsy in Spite of Herself. Having been reunited with her old friends Betsy and Tacy, and re-entering a co-educational setting after years in a girls-only school, Tib is initially very interested in her friends' advice on attracting young men by seeming less practical and knowledgeable than she really is. However, at various points in the novel the narrator portrays this dumbing-down as a silly and unnecessary self-denial that is not very satisfying.

Crowell Co.) Betsy and Joe (1948) is the eighth volume in the Betsy-Tacy series by Maud Hart Lovelace. This installment spans the title characters' senior, or twelfth grade, year in high school.  Plot summary  Betsy and Joe details the events of Betsy Ray's senior year (1909-1910) at Deep Valley High School in Deep Valley, Minnesota. Betsy had first met Joe Willard in the fifth book of the series, Heaven to Betsy, at Willard's Emporium, a store in the country owned by Joe's uncle. The two of them did not become close friends initially, as they competed in school for top marks in English class and in the annual high school essay competition. Joe's parents had died earlier, causing him to have to spend his time working to support himself and making him, in Betsy's opinion, proud. At the end of the previous book, Betsy Was a Junior, Betsy's classmate, Joe Willard, sent her a postcard requesting to correspond over the summer while he was away working in the harvest fields. Joe soon moved to North Dakota to help run a newspaper, and over the summer while Betsy is away on vacation at Murmuring Lake, Betsy and Joe corresponded, Betsy on her \\"scented, greensealed\\" stationery replying to Joe's \\"typewritten letters.\\" While at Murmuring Lake, Betsy is often visited by her good friend, Tony Markham. Tony tends to run with a wild crowd, so Betsy encourages his visits to keep him with the Crowd. In September, school begins, and Joe makes his first visit to Betsy's home and soon he comes every Sunday night for \\"Sunday Night Lunch.\\" The first dance of the school year is announced, and to Betsy's dismay Tony asks her first. After Betsy explains the situation to Joe, he makes a blanket invitation for her to go to all the rest of the dances with him. Betsy declines because she feels it would be unfair to Tony to shut him out of her life like that, even though she only likes him as a friend. The fall progresses with Tony and Joe both taking Betsy to various events, and soon it is time for the New Year's Eve dance. Again, Tony asks Betsy first -- despite Betsy's having tried to give Joe a chance to invite her first -- and Betsy feels she can't say no, so she accepts even though she would rather go with Joe. When Joe finds out, he is angry and says they should stop seeing one another. When school resumes after break, the two of them are no longer friends and scarcely talk to each other. Tony becomes more serious about Betsy. Just before Easter break, Tony tries to kiss Betsy and she tells him she only likes him as a friend. She then goes away for a week to visit friends of her father in the country, the Beidwinkles. At the end of the week, Betsy and the Beidwinkles visit Willard's Emporium, where Betsy and Joe meet again and rekindle their friendship in the place where it began. They spend the day together, and when they both return to Deep Valley they begin \\"going together.\\" Tony leaves school to go work on Broadway in New York, and Joe and Betsy end the year happily \\"almost engaged.\\"  Other storylines  A football star, Ralph Maddox, moves to Deep Valley, and begins to go with Tib. The team suffers loss after loss due to his unwillingness to sacrifice his good looks for the win, until a skit at the final pep rally mocks him and Tib threatens to stop dating him unless they win. Betsy's best friend, Tacy, turns 18 in February 1910, and soon meets Harry Kerr, a business associate of Mr. Ray's, who is roughly 10 years older than Tacy. After meeting the first time and spending the evening together at Sunday Night Lunch, Mr. Kerr tells Mr. Ray that he has decided he's going to marry Tacy, no matter how long he has to wait.

In 1999, Josh embarked on a singing career and recorded a CD that didn't sell. Later that year, Josh also started a romance with Yasmin McHugh (Ebony Thomas). Josh did stints working as a barman and working in Dusty (Doreen Ingleton), Yasmin's mother's store. The week before that Christmas, Josh and Yasmin were married and went on their honeymoon to Jamaica. Only three months into his marriage to Yasmin, Josh became bored and soon began having an affair with Pete's daughter Julie- Ann Jones (Chloe Howman) and left Charnham for Greece with her, leaving Yasmin heartbroken. However, many months later Josh returned and wanted to patch things up with Yasmin. Josh, along with his father, Dave, endured a long- running enmity with Pete Callan. Pete had had an affair with Cat while Dave was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and had fathered Cat's baby, Dave Jr. When Pete opened The Black Swan, which became the local pub, Josh was compelled to work there to pay off a debt. At around this time in mid-2000, Josh had fallen for barmaid Siobhan Jones (Jemma Walker), who happened to be the half-sister of Julie-Ann and began an affair with her. Josh was crushed when he found out Pete and Siobhan were engaged to be married and Siobhan told him to go back to Yasmin, who was pregnant with Josh's baby. Josh then paid a visit to Claire Toomey (Tina Hall), Pete's ex-wife who revealed that she was still married to him. One night in 2000, Josh went to confront Pete in the flat above the pub and the two got into a fight. Siobhan who had woken up, saw Pete in difficulty, acted instinctively and hit Josh over the head with a candlestick. When Siobhan turned the lights on, she panicked and rang for an ambulance. Pete used this opportunity to deal the already stunned Josh another blow, killing him. Siobhan and Pete were subsequently questioned. Pete was released, but Siobhan was detained. Yasmin initially blamed Siobhan for Josh's death, but Dave was certain Pete was behind it but had no way of proving it. Eventually in 2001, The case went to trial and neither Pete nor Siobhan were found guilty.

It is designed to wound or kill by explosive fragmentation. The mine is similar to the American M18 Claymore with a few differences.Brassey's Essential Guide to Anti-personnel Landmines, Eddie Banks, p.244 Design It has folding scissor type legs for supporting and aiming, but it also has an attachment point on the bottom for connecting a special clamp/spike which can be attached to wood, metal etc. It has a peep sight centered on the top which is flanked by two detonator cavities. The mine contains 700g of RDX (PVV-5A) to propel approximately 540 or 485 fragments to a lethal range of 50 meters in a 54¬∞ arc (spread of 45 meters at 50 meter range). The fragments can be steel balls (540) or short steel rods (485) depending on the variant. The MON-50 is usually command actuated using a PN manual inductor and an EDP-R electric detonator. It can also be actuated by a variety of booby trap (BT) switches including the MUV series pull; the MVE-72 electric breakwire; or the VP13 seismic controller. The MON 50 will usually be mounted above ground level on the surface or up in trees to give the greatest dispersion of fragments. It is waterproof and will function effectively from +50 to -50 ¬∞C (it can be buried in snow as long as the pack in front of the mine doesn't exceed 10 cm, any more will greatly reduce the mine effectiveness). The mine can be located visually or with metal detectors under most field conditions. Depending on its actuation method the MON-50 may be resistant to blast overpressure from explosive breaching systems like the Giant Viper and M58 MICLIC. The MON-50 is currently manufactured in Russia and also manufactured for export in Bulgaria. The MON 50 is widely used in many parts of the world. It comes in a two pouch cloth bandolier which holds all the components for securing and command actuating the mine. It may also come packed in a VKPM-2 set which contains 4 mines complete with miscellaneous fuzes, control panel and wire.

It is a hand laid directional fragmentation mine which is normally command actuated (always secure command wires). The MON-50 is known to be used with the VP13 seismic controller which prevents close approach for any clearance operations, or to a variety of BT fuzes.

He began his education in the common schools of his native town, and mastered the higher branches in Barre Academy and Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire. While in Barre at the age of 17, he used an odometer in surveying for a county map of Caledonia County, a task which occupied him for two months. From the age of nineteen until the spring of 1861, he was his father's assistant in his extensive business. Civil War Statue of Wells in Battery Park (Burlington, Vermont). An identical statue can be found in Gettysburg National Park. At the outbreak of the Civil War, William Wells and three of his brothers joined the Union army. Wells enlisted as a private soldier on September 9, 1861, and assisted in raising Company C of the 1st Vermont Cavalry. He was sworn into Federal service October 3, 1861, and was soon promoted first lieutenant and then captain in November of that year. He was in the thickest of the fight at Orange Court House, Virginia, August 2, 1862, and was promoted to major on October 30, 1862. =Medal of Honor= Wells commanded the Second Battalion, 1st Vermont Cavalry, in the repulse of Stuart's Cavalry at the Battle of Hanover during the Gettysburg Campaign. In the famous and desperate cavalry charge on Big Round Top on the third day at Gettysburg (July 3, 1863), he commanded the leading battalion, rode by the side of General Farnsworth, the brigade commander, and, almost by a miracle, came out unharmed, while his commander fell in the midst of the enemy's infantry. A few days later, in the savage cavalry melee at the Battle of Boonsboro in Maryland, Wells was wounded by a sabre cut. At Culpeper Court House, Virginia, September 13, 1863, he charged the enemy's artillery with his regiment and captured a gun, and was again wounded, by a shell. Congress later awarded Wells a Medal of Honor \\"for distinguished gallantry at the battle of Gettysburg, July 3, 1863.\\" After the return of the regiment from the Kilpatrick raid, in March 1864, Major Wells was detached and placed in command of the 7th Michigan Cavalry (which had lost its commander) for a month. He commanded a battalion of Sheridan's cavalry at the Battle of Yellow Tavern, in which J.E.B. Stuart was killed. Wells was promoted to colonel on June 4, 1864. From September 1864 to April 1865, he was several times in command of the Third Cavalry Division. In the Battle of Tom's Brook, Virginia (October 9, 1864), a cavalry action, Wells commanded a brigade of Custer's division, and at Cedar Creek, his brigade took a foremost part in turning the rout of the morning into a decisive victory at nightfall, capturing forty-five of the forty-eight pieces of artillery taken from Jubal Early's fleeing army. Plaque of General Wells's military record (Battery Park, Burlington, VT) Wells was appointed brevet brigadier general of volunteers on February 22, 1865. On the personal recommendations of Generals Sheridan and Custer, Wells was commissioned brigadier general May 16, 1865, and he was appointed brevet major general of volunteers, March 30, 1865, \\"for gallant and meritorious service,\\" having received more promotions than any other Vermont officer during the war (from Private to General in less than three and a half years). Wells served under Generals Kilpatrick, Sheridan, and Custer, and was with Kilpatrick in his famous raid on Richmond, and with James H. Wilson in his daring foray to the south of that city. At Appomattox Court House, on the morning of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, Wells' brigade had started on its last charge and was stopped by General Custer in person. He distinguished himself repeatedly in action. Sheridan remarked: \\"He is my ideal of a cavalry officer.\\" Following Appomattox, the departure of Sheridan and Custer for Texas left Wells as the ranking officer and last commander of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. At the Grand Review in Washington, D.C. on May 22, 1865, he commanded the Second Brigade of Custer's Division of the Cavalry Corps, which led the advance. Wells participated in seventy cavalry engagements, in eighteen of which he led a brigade or division. He was honorably mustered out of army January 15, 1866. Postbellum career The Wells Richardson Building on College Street in Burlington, Vermont, where Paine's Celery Compound was made. Part of the Wells Richardson Historic District as listed on the National Register of Historic Places Soon after General Wells' return to civil life, he became a partner in a firm of wholesale druggists at Waterbury. In 1868 they transferred their business to Burlington, which was thereafter his residence. He represented Waterbury in the legislature of 1865-66, being chairman of the military committee and an influential legislator. In 1866 he was elected adjutant general of Vermont, and held the office until 1872. He was succeeded by James Stevens Peck and accepted appointment as collector of customs for the district of Vermont, a position which he filled with efficiency and credit for thirteen years. At the end of that time, he resumed his active connection with the business house known the world over as the Wells Richardson Company, manufacturer of Paine's Celery Compound. General Wells was married with two children ‚Äî Frank Richardson and Bertha Richardson Wells (who later married Dr. Horatio Nelson Jackson). In 1886, Wells was state senator from Chittenden County, Vermont. He was active in veteran soldiers' societies; was one of the presidents of the Reunion Society of Vermont Officers, and president of the Society of the First Vermont Cavalry. He was one of the trustees, and first president of the Vermont Soldiers' Home, and was a member of the Gettysburg Commission of 1889-90. He was the first commander of the Vermont Commandery of the Loyal Legion, and would have been re-elected had he lived until the coming annual meeting of the Commandery. He was a member of Stannard Post, No. 2, G. A. R., Department of Vermont, and would have been made department commander several years ago had he been willing to accept an election as such. He was a member of the Vermont Society of Sons of the American Revolution. Statue by J. Otto Schweizer at Gettysburg. General Wells was identified with many important business enterprises in the city, being president of the Burlington Trust Company, president of the Burlington Gas-Light Company, president of the Burlington Board of Trade, director in the Burlington Cold Storage Company, director in the Rutland Railroad Company and director in the Champlain Transportation Company. He was a member and a vestryman of St. Paul's church, and was one of the trustees of the Young Men's Christian Association of Burlington, and one of its most liberal supporters. Few men, if any, touched the life of the community in which he lived in so many important capacities. His sudden death from angina pectoris in New York City removed, while in the prime of life, a most genial, courteous and kind-hearted man, a gallant soldier, and one of the most respected citizens of the Green Mountain state. Burlington effectively shut down for his funeral. His remains lie at Lakeview Cemetery on North Avenue.

Biography  Desnitsky was born in Nizhyn, present-day Ukraine. He was the second son of a meschanin, a member of the petty bourgeoisie. After a brief spell in the Trinity Lavra seminary, he attended Moscow University, starting in 1759. He went to continue his education at the University of Glasgow, where he studied with Adam Smith. In 1767, upon receiving a doctor of laws degree (LLD), he returned to Russia and was appointed professor of law at Moscow University. Desnitsky was the first Russian professor to question the authority of Samuel von Pufendorf on legal matters and the first to introduce the doctrines of Adam Smith and David Hume to Russian students. He also translated the works of Sir William Blackstone (Commentaries of the laws of England) and advocated equality of the sexes in family law. Desnitsky pioneered the comparative approach to the study of law and regarded property as a cornerstone of every legal system. There was a great outcry over his rejection of Latin as the sole language of instruction; but Catherine II of Russia personally settled the issue in his favour.

She was 18 years old in 1974 when she and hired killer Marthinus Choegoe stabbed Susanna Magdalena van der Linde, the wife of Lehnberg‚Äôs 47-year-old lover Christiaan van der Linde, to death with a pair of scissors. At 19 she was then the youngest woman to be convicted of murder in South Africa. Both Lehnberg and Marthinus Choegoe received the death penalty, but this was later set aside and she served 11 years of her 20-year sentence in Pollsmoor Prison outside Cape Town. Background In February 1972, Lehnberg began her first job as a clerical assistant/receptionist at the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Rondebosch, Cape Town. She started work in the orthopaedic workshop alongside Christiaan van der Linde. Van der Linde was the workshop's chief technician and Lehnberg, a bright, intelligent and attractive 16-year-old, was apparently drawn to him from the start. Lehnberg's upbringing had been both ultra-conservative and strict. Her father was puritanical, a man who rarely displayed any affection towards his daughters. She had not been allowed to socialise and had never been to the cinema during the time she was in high school, she was a very intelligent young girl academically and often came first in her class but had no experience of boys or men, she was very naive and innocent and tried hard to get attention via her studies. She was drawn to van der Linde, a person whom she saw as a being warm and friendly father figure. She later recalled \\"he said \\"welcome\\" and my heart beat faster.\\" Van der Linde and Lehnberg struck up a father-daughter type relationship which grew closer as the months passed. In April 1973, a year after they first met, the couple began an affair. The affair Throughout the remainder of 1973, Lehnberg and Van der Linde continued to meet in secret at Rondebosch Common and Paarden Eiland. Then, early in 1974, their intimacy stopped. Van der Linde suspected that they were being watched because his wife was receiving anonymous telephone calls. Despite the fact that Van der Linde had declared that he would never leave his wife and family, Lehnberg was convinced that the only obstacle to them having a more permanent relationship was the presence of Van der Linde's wife, Susanna. By July 1974, Lehnberg was becoming desperate and started talking about leaving Cape Town. Christiaan van der Linde persuaded her not to, but by September she had finally tired of the situation and decided to confront Susanna. Lehnberg called and explained that she and Christiaan were very much in love and were seeing each other every night. She wanted to know what Susanna van der Linde intended doing, but Susanna van der Linde hung up on her. A few weeks later, Lehnberg telephoned again. This time she made an appointment to go and see her. They met in Bellville early in October. Initially, Lehnberg had hoped that she and Susanna van der Linde could come to some sort of arrangement concerning Christiaan, but this meeting was to change all of those ideas. Not only did Susanna van der Linde tell Lehnberg that she would never give her husband a divorce because of the children, she also added, she didn‚Äôt mind playing second fiddle as long as Lehnberg didn't mind either. It was obvious to Lehnberg that Susanna van der Linde was prepared to do anything to keep her husband. Run-up to the murder It was around this time that Lehnberg met Marthinus Charles Choegoe, who had lost a leg in a motorcar accident. He had come to the Orthopaedic Workshop to have an artificial limb fitted. He was unemployed and his disabilities, both physical and social, had destroyed his self-esteem. This may have made him particularly susceptible to Lehnberg's approaches. Lehnberg first contacted Choegoe by letter, which she wrote to him care of Solly's Trading Store, his local shop. In the letter she asked him to come and see her at the Orthopaedic Workshop, adding that if he was clever he could still earn good money. When he arrived at the workshop Lehnberg gave him R1.00 and asked him to meet her at the Rondebosch town hall at 7 p.m. that evening, at which time she gave him a bottle of gin and said that she wanted him to murder a woman for her. Choegoe declined at first, saying that he was afraid of being sent to the gallows. After some discussion Choegoe finally agreed to Lehnberg's request. Several days later he went to the address in Boston, Bellville which Lehnberg had given him, later claiming that he planned to warn Susanna van der Linde that her life was in danger. But instead of warning Susanna van der Linde of Lehnberg's plans, he simply asked her for some money. She said she didn't have any and went back inside the house. A week later Choegoe and Lehnberg met in Rondebosch once more. This time he admitted that he was too afraid to go through with the murder. Lehnberg gave him a radio and promised that she would help him to receive an artificial limb if he did away with Susanna van der Linde. Choegoe went to Bellville again but on this occasion he simply walked past the house and made no attempt to enter. Shortly afterward Lehnberg sent Choegoe a second letter, again urging him to go through with the murder, using a knife if he had to. She got another message to him, asking him to telephone her at work. During the subsequent conversation Lehnberg insisted that Choegoe go through with the murder. She promised to give him a car and have sex with him after the crime had been committed. Murder In October 1974 Lehnberg handed in her notice at the hospital and told van der Linde that she was going to leave Cape Town. On 24 October Lehnberg collected Choegoe from his home in Retreat and drove him to Bellville in her car. He was armed with a hammer which was to be used to kill Susanna van der Linde. Lehnberg dropped him off in the vicinity of Boston and sped away. Shortly afterward Choegoe was spotted by Susanna van der Linde. She was alarmed because she had seen him in the area on more than one occasion. She telephoned the Bellville Police Station and Choegoe was picked up by the police about two blocks from her house. At the police station he was beaten and warned not to return to the area. In the face of repeated failure Lehnberg decided to take matters into her own hands again. A few days after Choegoe's failed attempt, she approached Rob Newman, a 24-year old engineering student whom she knew, and asked to borrow his Llama pistol. When he refused she asked if he would kill someone for her. Again he refused but on 28 October Newman's pistol was stolen from his room. He reported the theft to the police and suggested Lehnberg as a likely suspect. Around 8.30 a.m. on the morning of Monday 4 November 1974 Lehnberg arrived at Choegoe's home. She said that her car was packed and she was on her way to Johannesburg, but before she left she needed Choegoe to come with her to van der Linde's house. He claimed in a statement that it wasn't until she handed him the Llama pistol on the way to Bellville that he realized that she wasn't just going to say goodbye. They arrived outside the house just after 9 a.m. Susanna van der Linde was alone inside. From this point on Choegoe's and Lehnberg's account of what followed differ. =Different accounts= Lehnberg claimed that she got out of the car, rang the doorbell and returned to the car while Choegoe entered the house alone and committed the murder. Choegoe, however, maintained that they acted together throughout. Choegoe's account was supported by a neighbour of the van der Linde's, Mrs. Marais. On the morning in question, Marais had walked past Lehnberg's white Ford Anglia twice in the space of ten or twelve minutes while it was parked opposite the van der Linde house and on both occasions the car was empty. Choegoe said that after Lehnberg rang the bell they went into the house together. When Susanna van der Linde saw them both she became frightened and threatened to phone the police. She attempted to get away, but was tripped by Lehnberg, fell and hit her head on the door. While Susanna van der Linde was on the floor Lehnberg struck her on the jaw with the butt of the pistol. On Lehnberg's instructions Choegoe began to throttle the semi-conscious Susanna van der Linde. Lehnberg then gave him a pair of scissors she had taken from the sideboard. Choegoe said he remembered stabbing Susanna van der Linde three times but the pathologist later noted seven stab wounds, six of which had penetrated the chest. After the murder Lehnberg squirted green dye over Choegoe using a gas pistol belonging to Susanna van der Linde. After warning Choegoe that she would deny any involvement in the murder if he went to the police, Lehnberg took him home. She set off for Johannesburg, collecting two speeding tickets at Beaufort West on the journey When the police brought van der Linde home to identify his wife he casually turned the body with his foot and said that it was his wife. This was reported at the time by the police officers present as appearing callous and almost as if he had been expecting it. It was suggested at the time that van der Linde had influenced Lehnberg in order to get her to murder his wife but this was not proven and he was never charged. =Arrest= Choegoe kept both of the pistols that were used at the scene of the crime which were later seized by police. When he was asked why he hadn't discarded them he replied that it was dangerous to throw pistols away. Susanna van der Linde's body was discovered at about 1 p.m. by her daughter. van der Linde attempted to telephone his wife a number of times that morning and eventually became concerned when there was no reply. He spoke to his daughter Zelda, who worked at Tygerberg Hospital, and asked her to go home during her lunch break to see if there was anything wrong. When she arrived home the house was locked up, but through a window she caught a glimpse of her mother lying on the floor in the living room. The police immediately began an intensive murder investigation. Their chief suspect was \\"a crippled coloured man\\" who had been seen in the area on at least two occasions prior to the murder. In fact, it was because of Choegoe that Susanna van der Linde insisted that her husband buy her a dye pistol. At first nobody considered that Lehnberg was involved or that she may have hired an assassin. For the next week police efforts to establish Choegoe's identity and whereabouts proved fruitless. But at around 7.30 a.m. on 13 November a breakthrough occurred. Lieutenant Roland Fourie of the Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad in Johannesburg went to see Lehnberg, who was staying at her uncle's house in Bryanston and asked her to accompany him to Brixton Police Station where he wished to ask her some questions. Lehnberg admitted on the way to the police station that van der Linde was her lover. She added that she had been expecting the police to contact her ever since she first heard about the murder of Susanna van der Linde from her mother. When asked if she had an association with \\"a coloured man named Marthinus\\" she denied the allegation. Fourie also asked her if she had once requested a Robert Newman to give her his pistol so that she could get rid of Susanna van der Linde. Lehnberg admitted that she had, but that the request had been made in fun. Although Fourie had no specific evidence to tie Lehnberg to the murder it did strike him that she seemed unnaturally nervous at times during the interview. While Fourie was on the telephone to Cape Town another detective, Major van Aswegen, began asking Lehnberg questions. She suddenly blurted out that she took Choegoe to the van der Linde house, waited for him outside and took him home afterwards. Lehnberg was arrested and formally charged with the murder of Susanna van der Linde. Later that day she made a full statement in which she admitted that she had asked Choegoe, if he would do away with Susanna van der Linde. In the statement she claimed that she had waited in the car while her accomplice had committed the crime. Choegoe was arrested the same day. The trial of Lehnberg and Choegoe began at the Cape Town Supreme Court on 5 March 1975. The trial drew hundreds of spectators who fought for seats in the packed courtroom. After a hearing which lasted seven days, during which the State called more than 30 witnesses, the Judge, Justice Diemont and his two assessors, A.J. van Niekerk and F. van Zyl Smith, deliberated overnight and returned verdicts of guilty for both accused. The court found no extenuating circumstances and Lehnberg and Choegoe were sentenced to death. Appeal and imprisonment Two months later, the case was re-opened on appeal. In July 1975, the death sentences were set aside. Lehnberg was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and Choegoe to 15 years.Case History - The belated psychiatrists Choegoe, however, was released in June 1986 and became an evangelical preacher, while Lehnberg was paroled in December of the same year. Lehnberg ended her life in October 2015, five days before her 60th birthday. She had suffered from osteoporosis for years and had also been diagnosed with breast cancer. She could no longer take the severe pain she was in and committed suicide alone at home, and in relative obscurity. Choegoe died in a car accident in 1992 on the N7 near Nuwerus in the Western Cape. The third member of the tragic triangle, Christiaan van der Linde, died a lonely man in 1983. After the trial, he moved to Krugersdorp so that he could visit his wife's grave on her family's farm in the Magaliesberg mountains every day. He expressed remorse of ever having met Marlene Lehnberg. Aftermath After the trial a law known as the \\"Marlene Lehnberg Clause\\" was passed in South Africa, preventing convicted criminals from profiting from their crimes, since it was believed that Lehnberg planned to sell her story to the press for a large sum of money.

It is broadly similar to the M18A1 Claymore mine. The casing is a light green color with two detonator wells and three crude sight lines on the top and an embossed grid pattern on the front of some early mines. Two detachable metal legs fit in slots on the bottom to secure the mine when it is ground mounted. The body of the MRUD is waterproof and the mine can be used in temperatures from -30Àö to + 50Àö C. The mine body contains 900 grams of TNT-based explosive and 650 5.5-millimeter steel balls. When fired the fragmentation has a lethal arc of 60 degrees and a lethal range of 40‚Äì50 meters. The MRUD kit comes packed with a manual inductor, circuit test device and an EK-40-69 electric detonator. The mine can be command detonated from up to 30 meters away using a manual inductor or another electrical power source. The fuse cavities also accept any Serbian booby trap fuse with an M10 x 1 mm including the UMP-1 and UMP-2 pull and the UMNOP-1 multi-function fuse. The MRUD comes packed in a grey/green colored canvas shoulder bag which also contains the firing cable a circuit tester and a manual inductor. Ten of these sets come packed in a natural wooden crate. These mines have been encountered mounted high in trees as well as the more conventional ground mounting. The MRUD can be located visually as well as with metal detectors. Depending on the actuation method the MRUD will have a limited resistance to blast overpressure from explosive breaching methods like the Giant Viper and MICLIC.

When the blast mine actuated, the MRUD was actuated as well. If an insulated wire is encountered, care must be taken to establish control of both ends of the wire before attempting to neutralize the mine. The mine should be approached from a 90Àö angle (never from the front) in order to remain outside of its blast arc. When tracking the route of a tripwire, keep in mind that additional anti-personnel blast mines may have been buried along its length. It is all too easy to concentrate on following the tripwire, forgetting what may lie concealed underneath it.

Book contents  * Section I - a review of mathematics, epistemology and science from the classical to the early modern period. * Section II - a review of the ineluctable rise of formalism in mathematics and in fundamental physical science, which, Omn√®s argues, was not a choice, but was forced on researchers by the nature of the subject matter. * Section III - the central section of the book, in which the recovery of common sense, as outlined below, is presented. * Section IV - a short section of reflections on possible future steps.  Brief summary of Omn√®s' central argument  Omn√®s' project is not quite as it at first sounds. He is not trying to show that quantum mechanics itself can be understood in a common sense framework, quite the opposite. He argues that modern science has, necessarily, become more and more formal, and more and more remote from common sense, as it strives to make itself an accurate reflection of the physical world. But he argues that we have now come near enough to scaling the 'magnificent peaks' of the formal mathematics needed to describe reality for one thing to have finally become clear: it is now possible to demonstrate, formally, and starting from the underlying principles of quantum mechanics, that the laws of classical logic, classical probability and classical dynamics apply to objects at the macroscopic level. As Omn√®s makes explicit, this is the exact opposite of the classical epistemological project. It has always, up to now, been necessary to access reality by first presupposing the laws of classical common sense. Now finally, we can enter the world either at the formal level, or at the classical level, and we find that each entails the other: experiment has led to the quantum formalism; the quantum formalism now, finally, allows the recovery of the framework of classical reasoning under which the experiments took place. Omn√®s emphasises throughout that no new principles, other than those described when quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s, are needed. Moreover, some additional principles which seemed to be required then (such as wavefunction collapse, or its slightly more formal sister, wavefunction reduction) are no longer needed. Classical behaviour can now be recovered in a system described entirely by a single, unitary (time-reversible) wavefunction. The mathematical developments which allowed this progress have taken place in two fields: quantum decoherence and the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics. The consistent histories approach makes mathematically explicit which sets of classical questions can be consistently asked of a single quantum system, and, conversely, which sets of questions are fundamentally inconsistent, and thus meaningless when asked together. We can therefore demonstrate formally why it is that the questions which Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen assumed could be asked together, of a single quantum system, simply cannot be asked together. On the other hand, we can demonstrate that classical, logical reasoning often does apply, even to quantum experiments ‚Äì but we can now be mathematically exact about the limits of classical logic. Quantum decoherence, on the other hand (in combination with the consistent histories approach), recovers classical behaviour at the macroscopic level. The formal mathematics of this approach allows us to demonstrate, finally, that is impossible (or rather, massively improbable) for a macroscopic Schr√∂dinger's cat to exist for longer than a minuscule time (related to the macroscopic energy dissipation time by a factor involving the square of Planck's constant) in a quantum superposition of its and . states. Even for a cat otherwise isolated from the rest of the Universe, and even with no observer present, there are so many unknowns in the quantum state of the whole cat, that the relevant mathematics determine that only the normally observed classical states of the cat are at all probable, except over the very shortest of timescales. This reasoning is developed formally within measurement theory, and applies to any macroscopic, non-super cooled measuring device, whether or not there is an observer to watch it.  Collaborators  Omn√®s makes clear that others contributed materially to the research described in his book, including Robert Griffiths, Murray Gell-Mann, and James Hartle.

A barker would often conduct a brief free show, introducing performers and describing acts to be given at the feature performance. Professional barkers strongly disliked the term and instead referred to themselves as \\"talkers\\". Perhaps the most famous fictional barkers are Billy Bigelow, the protagonist of Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic stage musical Carousel, and Tin Man, a supporting protagonist from the 1978 musical film The Wiz portrayed by Nipsey Russell. Bigelow, in turn was an Americanized version of Liliom, the protagonist of Hungarian author Ferenc Moln√°r's non- musical play Liliom, on which Carousel is based.

Early home computers lacked the power and storage necessary for true multimedia.

The Amiga 1000 from Commodore International has been called the first multimedia computer. Its groundbreaking animation, graphics and sound technologies enabled multimedia content to flourish. Famous demos such as the Boing Ball and Juggler showed off the Amiga's abilities. Later the Atari ST series and Apple Macintosh II extended the concept; the Atari integrated a MIDI port and was the first computer under US$1000 to have 1 megabyte of RAM which is a realistic minimum for multimedia content and the Macintosh was the first computer able to display true photorealistic graphics as well as integrating a CD-ROM drive, whose high capacity was essential for delivering multimedia content in the pre-Internet era. Multimedia capabilities were not common on IBM PC compatibles until the advent of Windows 3.0 and the MPC standards in the early 1990s. The original PCs were devised as \\"serious\\" business machines and colorful graphics and powerful sound abilities weren't a priority. The few games available suffered from slow video hardware, PC speaker sound and limited color palette when compared to its contemporaries. But as PCs penetrated the home market in the late 1980s, a thriving industry arose to equip PCs to take advantage of the latest sound, graphics and animation technologies. Creative's SoundBlaster series of sound cards, as well as video cards from ATI, Nvidia and Matrox soon became standard equipment for most PCs sold. Most PCs today have good multimedia features. They have dual- or single- core CPUs clocked at 3.0 GHz or faster, at least 1GB of RAM and a 128 MB or higher video card. Popular graphics cards include Nvidia Gforce or ATI Radeon. The Intel Viiv platform, and Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition are some of today's products aimed at multimedia computing.

Sikking, and Joe Regalbuto. The film was written by Roderick Taylor and Peter Hyams and directed by Hyams. Its title is taken from the name of the Star Chamber, the notorious 15th‚àí17th-century English court. Plot Judge Steven Hardin (Michael Douglas) is an idealistic Los Angeles judge who becomes frustrated when the technicalities of the law prevent the prosecution of three criminals. The first is a man who was charged with murdering several elderly women for their welfare money. The second and third are two men who were accused of raping and killing an eight-year-old boy as part of a suspected child pornography ring. The suspected child murderers attracted the attention of two police officers when they were driving slowly late at night. The police officers suspected that the van's occupants might be burglars. After checking the license plate for violations, the officers pulled the van over for expired paperwork. They also claimed to have smelled marijuana, and then saw a bloody shoe inside the van. However, the reason for stopping the van turned out to be spurious: the paperwork was actually submitted on time (it was merely processed late). Since the traffic stop was illegal, based on the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine Hardin has no choice but to exclude any evidence discovered as a result of the traffic stop, including the bloody shoe. Hardin becomes even more distraught when the father of the murdered boy attempts to shoot the criminals in court, but misses and shoots one of the arresting officers instead. After another boy is discovered raped and murdered, the father of the original boy tells Harding \\"This one is on you, your Honor. That boy would be alive if you hadn't let those men go.\\" The father then commits suicide while in jail. Judge Hardin learns from his friend, Judge Caulfield (Hal Holbrook), of the existence of a modern-day Star Chamber. This is a group of judges that identifies criminals who cannot be brought to justice through the judicial system, and takes action against them using a hired assassin. Judge Hardin participates in one of the Star Chamber proceedings, and the assassin is dispatched to kill two other unrelated murderers who were released on technicalities despite their own confessions, as well as the suspected child murderers. Soon afterward, however, police detective Harry Lowes (Yaphet Kotto) comes to Hardin with conclusive evidence that someone else raped and killed the boy. Realizing that he and the Star Chamber have just sentenced two men to die for a crime that they did not commit, Hardin implores the Star Chamber to recall the assassin, but is told by the other judges that the hit cannot be canceled. For the judges' protection, there is a cut-out between them and the assassin; they do not know who he is, and he doesn't know who they are. They tell Hardin that, although an occasional mistake is inevitable and regrettable, what they are doing still serves society's greater good. They argue that the two targeted men are clearly criminals who are guilty of numerous other crimes, even if they are not guilty of the specific crime for which the group convicted them. Hardin makes it clear that he does not accept their reasoning. Caulfield warns him to back down because the members of the group will do whatever they have to in order to protect themselves. Hardin decides to make an effort to stop the men from being killed. He tracks down the men in an abandoned warehouse and attempts to warn them. However, he has stumbled across an illegal drug operation, and the men do not believe that he is there to rescue them. They attack Hardin, but the hitman, disguised as a police officer, kills them before they can kill Hardin. The hitman threatens to kill Hardin, but at the last moment Lowes arrives and kills the hitman. The film ends with the Star Chamber deciding another \\"case\\" without Hardin, who is outside in a car with Lowes recording their conversation.

Hyams said \\"I wanted first and foremost to make a film that is connected to an issue, not whether a bunch of judges getting together and ordering people's deaths is a credibility problem. The issue is the breakdown of the legal system and the resulting hysteria of crime . . . I was nervous about how young I could make Judge Hardin (Douglas), but I spent a lot of time at the Superior Court and there are silver foxes, sure, but there are also quite a few good-looking, 40-year-old judges on the bench.\\"The agony and the ecstasy Hyams tries for brass ring with new film Fraser, Matthew. The Globe and Mail1 3 July 1983: P.13. Reception The Star Chamber grossed $5.6 million. =Critical response= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives The Star Chamber a score of 71% based on reviews from 14 critics and a rating of 6 out of 10. Critic Roger Ebert wrote: \\"The Star Chamber works brilliantly until it locks into a plot. Then it stops dancing and starts marching. The movie opens with a series of intriguing scenes showing a series of shocking miscarriages of justice. Fiends and perverts are caught red-handed, confess to their crimes and then are put back on the streets again because of minor legal technicalities. [...] The ending of the movie was especially infuriating.\\" Critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote: \\"Peter Hyams has shown himself, with films like Busting, Outland, and Capricorn One, to be a stylish, flippant director, capable of generating a great deal of suspense as well as action scenes that really pack a wallop. The Star Chamber, which opens today at Loews Tower East and other theaters, begins so excitingly that Mr. Hyams appears to have outdone himself. [...] But The Star Chamber can't live up to its own initial promise ‚Äì nor does it really live up to Mr. Hyams's. His powerhouse style finally sabotages the issues raised by The Star Chamber, which remain much more delicate than the treatment they have been given here.

However, he was not a good student and barely passed the final examination. Initially commencing a science degree at Lausanne in 1868 Wiedersheim switched after one semester to a medical degree at T√ºbingen, following his father's wishes. He studied at T√ºbingen from 1868 to 1870 under Franz Leydig. In 1871 he moved his studies to W√ºrzburg and the following year to Freiburg. In 1872 Wiedersheim finished a doctoral thesis on the finer structural relations of the glands in the gizzard of birds, a subject suggested to him by Carl Hasse while in W√ºrzburg. In 1873 Wiedersheim married Mathilde (Tilla) Sophie Gruber with whom he had one son, Walter Wiedersheim. After finishing his studies Wiedersheim returned to W√ºrzburg where he worked as an assistant to Albert von Koelliker until 1876. In 1876 he became an associate professor of anatomy at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg where he taught until 1918.Goerttler K.

(1893) The Structure of Man: An Index to His Past History. Second Edition. Translated by H. and M. Bernard. London: Macmillan and Co. 1895. p.3 The structure of Man began as a much shorter academic treatise, Der Bau der Menschen, produced in 1887 with a small intended circulation. In its original form it lacked any illustrations and gave only a brief overview of many of its topics. Thanks to a high degree of interest and correspondence regarding the work Wiedersheim decided to publish a revised and expanded version.Wiedersheim, R. (1893) The Structure of Man: An Index to His Past History. Second Edition. Translated by H. and M. Bernard. London: Macmillan and Co. 1895. p.xi The German second edition was published in 1893 with an English translation by Henry and Matilda Bernard following in 1895. As part of the book Wiedersheim included a list of the organs discussed in the text which might be considered vestigial. He writes, \\"comparative morphology points not only to the essentially similar plan of organization of the bodies of all vertebrates, ... but also to the occurrence in them of certain organs, or parts of organs, now known as 'vestigial.' \\"By such organs are meant those which were formerly of greater physiological significance than at present.\\" He picked up on Darwin's concept of \\"rudimentary\\" organs such as listed in The Descent of Man: the muscles of the ear, wisdom teeth, the appendix, the coccyx (tail bone), body hair, and the semilunar fold in the corner of the eye. The list, however, contains structures which today are known to be essential, and thus represents a historical record of the physiologic understanding of the day. Evolutionists have used the credited examples of this list as an argument for evolution as they are evolutionary leftovers, of little use to the current organism. Creationists, on the other hand, have used the discredited examples as an argument against evolution. There is no \\"scientific\\" proof, they say, of the uselessness of a particular organ. It is important to note that a vestige is not necessarily a completely useless organ. Although defined as \\"useless\\" in popular media, a vestige as defined in evolutionary biology may still have some use, but the use has since diminished. This definition is consistent with Wiedersheim, who said that vestigial organs are \\"wholly or in part functionless\\" (Wiedersheim 1893, p. 200) and have \\"lost their original physiological significance\\" (p. 205). Although Wiedersheim's originally published list contains 86 items, later interpretations enlarged his list to 180 vestiges. The zoologist Horatio Newman said in a written statement read into evidence in the Scopes Trial that \\"There are, according to Wiedersheim, no less than 180 vestigial structures in the human body, sufficient to make of a man a veritable walking museum of antiquities.\\"Darrow, Clarence and William J.

In 1945 he became the first town mayor of the Soviet occupying forces in Berlin. Biography Berzarin was born in Saint Petersburg as the son of a pipefitter and a seamstress. He had one brother and four sisters. In 1925, he married bank employee Natalja Prosinjuk, with whom he had two daughters, Larissa and Irina. =Training= In 1918 Berzarin enlisted in the Red Army and fought against Allied troops in Archangelsk. Between 1921 and 1923 he received more military training at the Leningrad Command Courses, machine gun course at the \\"Vistrel\\" and a command course at the Siberian Military District. In 1922, he became a member of Komsomol. In 1923 he was assigned to Siberia. In 1926, after officer training, he became a member of the CPSU. =Military career= He began service as an enlisted soldier in the Soviet Union in Petrograd, and after service on the Northern Front against the Allied Intervention also participated in the suppression of the Kronstadt Rebellion (1921). In 1924 he was serving as a junior officer in the Amur region against the bandit raiders. In 1927 he returned to Siberia, where he was an assistant to commander of an officers training unit in Irkutsk. From 1933 to 1935, he served in the staff of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army; from 1935 to 1937 he led the 77th Rifle Regiment of the 26th Rifle Division of the Far Eastern Army. Until 1938, he was the chief instructor of the Amur group. During the Great Purge, he was accused of owing his career to the \\"enemies of the people\\", but was supported by various Communist Party members. As commander of the 32nd Rifle Division, he repelled Japanese attacks at Lake Khasan (1938), for which he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. After his appointment as Major General, he was transferred at his own request to Riga, and became commander of the 27th Army in May 1941. He fought against the German armed forces after their assault on the Soviet Union. From December 1941 to May 1944 he was Commander-in-Chief of several armies; he was badly wounded in March 1943 and was hospitalized for six months. He received the Order of Lenin and was promoted to Colonel General for his success in breaking through German lines in the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive. After conquering Chi»ôinƒÉu in August 1944, the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts began their march on Berlin. =Commander of Berlin= Berzarin on a 2019 stamp of Transnistria During the Battle of Berlin, Berzarin's 5th Shock Army reached the eastern outskirts of Berlin on 21 April 1945, making them the first Soviet Army to do so. On 24 April, he was appointed commander of the city by Marshal Zhukov, in an echo of the Tsarist tradition of rewarding the first commander to enter a city with command over it. By his \\"Order No. 1\\" on 28 April, Berzarin assumed all governmental power. He worked to re-establish order in the ruined German capital, creating a city police force and supplying the population with food, water, gas and electricity, as well as re-opening schools and theatres. On 17 May, he appointed non-partisan Arthur Werner the first post-war Mayor of Berlin presiding over a civil city government. On 16 June 1945, after only 55 days in office, he was killed in a motorcycle accident when he collided with a truck convoy near his office in Berlin- Friedrichsfelde, aged 41. Rumors that scattered Nazi Werwolf forces had assassinated him were never established. Berzarin is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Honorary citizenship Memorial plaque at Bersarinplatz, Berlin-Friedrichshain In 1975 Berzarin posthumously was bestowed honorary citizenship of East Berlin. After German reunification he was formally removed from the roll of honorary citizens by the Senate of Berlin in 1992. Upon a resolution by the Berlin Abgeordnetenhaus parliament, he regained his honorary citizenship in 2003, in view of his merits concerning the supply of the local population. Detractors of the re-awarding claimed that Berzarin was a Stalinist and involved in Soviet war crimes being responsible for the deportation of 47,000 Balts in 1940. These accusations, however, were proven wrong later on, as Berzarin was deployed in Vladivostok at the questioned time. Sp√§ter stellte sich heraus, dass der Russe zu dieser Zeit gar nicht im Baltikum, sondern im sibirischen Wladiwostok eingesetzt war. ‚Äì Later on it turned out that the Russian was not deployed at the Baltikum but in Wladiwostok, Sibiria From 1947 until 1991 Petersburger Stra√üe in Berlin- Friedrichshain, a section of the Inner Ring Road, was named Bersarinstra√üe in his honour, the Bersarinplatz roundabout bears his name up to today.

Bolotov was born and spent most of his adult life in the family estate of Dvoryaninovo, in the Tula region to the south of Moscow. He was brought up by his parents in Livland, where his father's regiment was stationed. After taking part in the Seven Years' War he settled into retirement in Dvoryaninovo. During his life there, he brought out a pioneering manual on crop rotation and elaborated an innovative system of pomology which included more than 600 cultivars of apple and pear. Always interested in plant breeding, Bolotov discovered dichogamy of apple-trees and pointed out to the advantages of cross-pollination. Bolotov's works brought him to the attention of Count Orlov, who asked him to manage the neighbouring estate of Bobriki, where Catherine II's illegitimate son, Count Bobrinsky, was being raised. Bolotov turned Bobriki into the most up-to-date agricultural estate in provincial Russia and ensured the keen interest which later Counts Bobrinsky would take in agriculture. Bolotov was also active in the Free Economic Society, which published his treatise on forestry. Together with Nikolay Novikov, he edited the journals The Village Resident (1778‚Äì79) and The Magazine of Economics (1780-89), which brought him the income of 400 roubles a year, a very considerable sum for the time. His extensive memoirs, entitled Life and Adventures of Andrei Bolotov, in 26 parts and written between 1789 and 1816, went through several editions and were translated into English. Bolotov died in Dvoryaninovo aged 94. Thomas Newlin wrote of him: > Andrey Timofeevich Bolotov stands out as the most prolific writer that > Russia has ever produced, penning, by one estimate, the equivalent of some > 350 volumes of written material--memoirs, diaries, letters, poems, plays, > criticism, and translations, as well as a vast array of other works of > literary, philosophical, religious, didactic, scientific, agricultural, and > historical natures--over the course of his long and quietly astonishing > career.

Jijeung continued this program in the following years, with a reform of ceremonial dress in 504 and of local administration in 505. In that reform, he incorporated the old territory of Siljik-guk into the Silla administrative system. He established a market in eastern Gyeongju in 509.

It is a major tributary of the Eel River and drains , mostly in Humboldt County, with a small portion in Trinity County. The river travels from its headwaters on the west side of the North Coast Range to its confluence with the Eel River, about upstream from the Pacific Ocean and south of Eureka, California. The river's elevation is over at its source and only when it merges with the Eel River. The river has two forks in its upper reaches. The North Fork travels northwest until it reaches the small town of Dinsmore, where it starts flowing west. The Little Van Duzen, which also flows northwest, joins the North Fork a few miles later. The river flows roughly west from then on. It meets its largest tributary, Yaeger Creek, about before it reaches the Eel River. The river is used for recreation at locations including Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park and for industrial, agricultural and municipal water supply by residents living along the western portion of California State Route 36. The river also provides wildlife habitat for preservation of rare and endangered species including cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning.State of California Water Quality Control Plan North Coastal Basin 1B July 1975 p.13 The primary land use in the watershed is timberland. Road construction and poor logging practices, particularly historical, have increased erosion, leading to excessive sediment buildup in the river and its tributaries. In addition, gravel mining, particularly at the confluence of the Van Duzen and Eel River, has increased erosion, affected channel alignment and may block fish migration. About 26 percent of the land is owned by industrial timber companies. About 31 percent is privately owned, but not industrial, land used for timber production and ranches. Residential land makes up 26 percent and public land makes up 17 percent. Most of the public land is near the river's headwaters in Six Rivers National Forest.

Griffiths (February 25, 1937) is an American physicist at Carnegie Mellon University. He is the originator of the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics, which has since been developed by himself, Roland Omn√®s, Murray Gell-Mann, and James Hartle. Early life and education Robert B. Griffiths was born in Etah, Uttar Pradesh in 1937 to Presbyterian missionaries. Griffiths attended Woodstock School, India from fourth standard to tenth, along with his brothers and sisters. Even during his Woodstock days, Griffiths' mathematical and scientific aptitude was apparent. The 1952 year book remarks that \\"Robert is famous for his long arguments (and unsurpassed knowledge) in chemistry class, his ability to 'recite' the log tables indelibly written in his brain, and his skill when it comes to fixing anything electrical.\\" This knack for electrical systems kept Griffiths at Woodstock through part of 1953, working with the school's various wiring systems. Academic career Following his time at Woodstock, Griffiths attended Princeton University where he earned a BA in Physics in 1957. He then earned both an MSc and PhD in Physics from Stanford University in 1958 and 1962 respectively. He was a Postdoctoral Fellow of the University of California, San Diego, from 1962‚Äì1964, Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University from 1964‚Äì1967, becoming Associate Professor in 1967 and Professor in 1969. Since that time, Griffiths' academic contributions have been widely recognized. Robert Griffiths was awarded a Phi Beta Kappa in 1956, was a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow from 1962‚Äì1964, an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow from 1966‚Äì1968, a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow in 1972, and was given the US Senior Scientist Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 1973. In 1981, he was awarded the A. Cressy Morrison Award of the New York Academy of Sciences, in 1984, the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, and in 1987 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Griffiths is well known for his research on statistical mechanics in the sixties and seventies of the last century, including exact inequalities in the Ising model and the introduction of the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model, describing tricritical points. Within his more recent work and research, Griffiths' primary focus has been in the field of quantum mechanics. Of the research, he has noted that \\"Quantum mechanics is hard to understand not only because it involves unfamiliar mathematics, but also because the usual discussion in textbooks about how to relate the mathematics to the real world is incomplete\\". It is this application of quantum information to the real world that Griffiths strives for. In 1984, he initiated a research program which sought to supply the missing link between theory and application while working out an entirely consistent form of quantum theory. Along with contributions of several key colleagues, the project eventually resulted in what is now commonly called the consistent (or decoherent) history approach to quantum theory, now effectively studied and applied in several areas of the field of quantum mechanics. At present, Griffiths is the Otto Stern University Professor of Physics at Carnegie Mellon University. He has published over 140 articles, as well as the book Consistent Quantum Theory. He is a member of Sigma Xi, a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Fellow of the American Scientific Affiliation. Griffiths' research interests continue to include the foundations of quantum mechanics, quantum computation, and the relation of physical science and Christian theology.

Buses serving the Taft Avenue and Rizal Avenue routes and nearby routes, jeepneys, taxis, tricycles, and kalesas stop at and around the station. Kalesas and tricycles are particularly used in Binondo, due to the district's narrow streets.

CAMHS services are organised locally, and the exact services provided may vary, often by local government area. Service organisation In the UK CAMHS are organised around a four tier system: :;Tier 1 ::general advice and treatment for less severe problems by non-mental health specialists working in general services, such as GPs, school nurses, social workers, and voluntary agencies. :;Tier 2 ::usually CAMHS specialists working in community and primary care, such as mental health workers and counsellors working in clinics, schools and youth services. :;Tier 3 ::usually a multi-disciplinary team or service working in a community mental health clinic providing a specialised service for more severe disorders, with team members including psychiatrists, social workers, board certified behaviour analysts, clinical psychologists, psychotherapists and other therapists. :;Tier 4 ::highly specialist services for children and young people with serious problems, such as day units, specialised outpatient teams and in-patient units. =Specialist CAMHS ‚Äì Tiers 3 and 4= Generally patients cannot self-refer to Tier 3 or 4 services, which are sometimes called specialist CAMHS. Referrals can be made by a wide range of agencies and professionals, including GPs and school nurses. The aim is to have a team led by a consultant psychiatrist, although other models exist and there is limited evidence of what system works best. It is suggested that there should be a consultant psychiatrist for a total population of 75,000, although in most of the UK this standard is not met. The Tier 4 service includes hospital care, with about 1,450 hospital beds provided in England for adolescents aged 13 to 18. Typical conditions that sometime require hospital care include depression, psychoses, eating disorders and severe anxiety disorders. The service may, depending on locality, include: *Psychiatry *Occupational therapy *Clinical psychology *Psychiatric nursing *Social worker interface *Psychotherapy *Language development *Behaviour analysis *Forensic CAMHS, working with young offenders or those at risk of offending Performance As of December 2016, some young English people with eating disorders were being sent hundreds of miles away to Scotland because the services they required were not available locally. Not withstanding good care in Scotland it was said that being away from friends and family compromised their recovery. In response the government had adopted a policy of ending such arrangements by 2021, and had allocated a cumulative ¬£150M to improve local availability of care. There are concerns that not enough is being done to support people at risk of taking their own lives. 1,039 children and adolescents in England were admitted to beds away from home in 2017‚Äì18, many had to travel over from home. Many had complex mental health issues frequently involving a risk of self-harm or suicide, like severe depression, eating disorders, psychosis and personality disorders.Children forced to travel hundreds of miles for NHS mental health treatment The Guardian In 2017-18 at least 539 children assessed as needing Tier 3 child and adolescent mental health services care waited more than a year to start treatment, according to a Health Service Journal survey which elicited reports from 33 out of the 50 mental health trusts. History The development of CAMHS within a four-tiered framework started in 1995. In 1998, 24 CAMHS Innovation Projects started, and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established related youth offending teams. In 2000 the NHS Plan Implementation Programme required health and local authorities to jointly produce a local CAMHS strategy. In November 2008 the independent CAMHS Review was published. From about 2013 onward major concerns have been expressed about reductions in CAMHS services, and apparently increasing demand, and in 2014 the parliamentary Health Select Committee investigated and reported on provision. In 2015 the government published a review, and promised a funding increase of about ¬£250 million per year. However the funds were not ring-fenced and as of 2016 only about half of England's Clinical commissioning groups had increased local CAMHS funding. CAMHS funding remains a popular topic for political announcements of funding and the current aim is to increase funding to the level that 35% of young people with a disorder are able to receive a specialist service. Different models of service organisation are also advocated as part of this transformation.https://www.elht.nhs.uk/services/east-lancashire-child-and- adolescent-services/understanding-camhs-what-it In Scotland, between 2007 and 2016 the number of CAMHS psychologists had doubled, reflecting increased demand for the service. 131 new CAMHS beds were commissioned by NHS England in 2018, increasing the existing 1,440 bed base by more than 10%. 56 will be in London, 12 at Bodmin Hospital and 22 at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital in Leeds.

New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2006. Retrieved 6 October 2008. Published by Longman, Brown, Green & Longmans in six fascicles between 1844 and 1846, the book detailed Talbot's development of the calotype photographic process and included 24 calotype prints, each one pasted in by hand, illustrating some of the possible applications of the new technology. It is regarded as an important and influential work in the history of photography and was described by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as \\"a milestone in the art of the book greater than any since Gutenberg's invention of moveable type.\\" At the time The Pencil of Nature was published, photography was still an unfamiliar concept for most people‚Äîthe Athenaeum magazine described Talbot's work as \\"modern necromancy\\"‚Äîand the book was the first opportunity for the general public to see what photographs looked like. To avoid any confusion, Talbot inserted the following notice into the book: The cover page for The Pencil of Nature clashed designs, which was characteristic of the Victorian era, with styles inspired by baroque, Celtic, and medieval elements.Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W. \\"Graphic Design and the Industrial Revolution\\" History of Graphic Design. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.152-153. Its symmetrical design, letterforms, and intricate carpet pages are similar to and a pastiche of the Book of Kells. The Pencil of Nature was published and sold one section at a time, without any binding (as with many books of the time, purchasers were expected to have it bound themselves once all the installments had been released). Talbot planned a large number of installments; however, the book was not a commercial success and he was forced to terminate the project after completing only six. Photographs View of the Boulevards at Paris Articles of China The Open Door Fac-simile of an Old Printed Page The Haystack The Ladder The 24 plates in the book were carefully selected to demonstrate a wide variety of potential applications for photography. They include a variety of architectural studies, scenes, still-lifes, and closeups, as well as facsimiles of prints, sketches, and text. Due to the long exposure times involved, however, Talbot included only one portrait, The Ladder (Plate XIV). Talbot also sought to demonstrate photography's potential as a new artistic medium with images like The Open Door (Plate VI). The complete list of plates is as follows: *Part 1 **I. Part of Queen's College, Oxford **II. View of the Boulevards at Paris **III. Articles of China **IV. Articles of Glass **V. Bust of Patroclus *Part 2 **VI. The Open Door **VII.

A Fruit Piece Text Each plate is accompanied by a short text which describes the scene and the photographic processes involved in obtaining it. Talbot emphasized the practical implications of his images (for instance, \\"The whole cabinet of a Virtuoso and collector of old China might be depicted on paper in little more time than it would take him to make a written inventory describing it in the usual way.\\"), but he also recognized their artistic value (\\"The chief object of the present work is to place on record some of the early beginnings of a new art, before the period, which we trust is approaching, of its being brought to maturity by the aid of British talent.\\") Due to the novelty of the subject, Talbot needed to point out some things that seem obvious today; for instance, \\"Groups of figures take no longer time to obtain than single figures would require, since the Camera depicts them all at once, however numerous they may be.\\" He also speculated about such questions as (among others) whether photographs would stand up as evidence in court and whether a camera could be made to record ultraviolet light. At the beginning of the book, Talbot included an incomplete history of his development of the calotype, titled \\"Brief Historical Sketch of the Invention of the Art.\\" The history ends rather abruptly, and though Talbot expressed his intention to complete it at a later date, he never did.

They are traditionally made from vulcanised rubber, but available in more modern PVC, neoprene and Gore-Tex variants. Waders are generally distinguished from counterpart waterproof boots by shaft height; the hip boot extending to the thigh and the Wellington boot to the knee. For the sake of emphasis, therefore, waders are sometimes defined by the extent of their coverage as thigh waders, chest waders or full-body waders. As a drysuit variant, full- body waders come with leaktight cuffs or gloves fitted to the sleeves and with a leaktight collar or hood fitted to the neck, enabling the wearer to remain dry when standing or walking in deeper water. Waders are available with boots attached or can have attached stocking feet (usually made of the wader material), to wear inside boots, or inside swimfins in the case of float tube fishing.  Origin  The first manufactured waders were made as early as the 1850s by a company called Hodgman. When rubber became popular around 1912, they started making the waders out of this particularly waterproof and durable material. Then rubber was more or less perfected in 1942 for World War II, so they used the same technology to make waders that are closer to what we have today. Types Chinese-made full-body chest-entry wading suit with attached boots, gloves and hood with uncut facepiece. Chinese-made full-body chest- entry wading suit with attached socks, wristseals and neckseal. There are two main types of waders: stocking-foot and boot-foot. Stocking-foot is separate from the boot and connects to it, while boot-foot includes the boot already.Bootfoot or stocking foot waders? Orvis News, 24 September 2012.  Uses  Fly fishermen using chest waders to stay dry. Waders have a wide range of applications. For leisure purposes, they are worn while angling, water gardening, playing with model boats, waterfowl hunting, and off-road riding of all-terrain vehicles. In the world of work, heavy-duty waders are used predominantly in the chemical industry, agriculture, aquaculture and in the maintenance of water supply, sewerage and other utilities. Waders are frequently worn by pastors during full-immersion baptism and they have an important application during flooding, when walking outdoors or indoors. Trench foot is common in those who spend a lot of time in the water without proper protection. People like fly fishermen use waders because they stay in the water for hours on end, and they need the proper protection.Medical Dictionary EMedicineHealth. Retrieved 5 December 2012. Depending on the kind of fish that the fisherman is catching, they might not need waders. Some fish are best caught on land. But some fish are best caught when the fisherman is chest deep in the water. Waders are also essential for keeping warm during colder months, because they keep the cold water off the skin, which otherwise could cause hypothermia or other problems.  Environmental impact  Many states in the US are beginning to ban certain types of waders, specifically those with porous, felt soles. These kinds of soles easily host various types of invasive species that could be carried from one water source to another. The invasive organisms and plants pose a threat to fish stocks and important fish habitats. For example, effective March 1, 2012, most counties in Missouri ban these kinds of waders while sport fishing in fresh water. And in all of Alaska, as of January 1, 2012, the same law applies.Preventing invasive species Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Retrieved 5 December 2012. In New Zealand, the use of felt-soled waders and boots for sports fishing was banned in 2008 as part of the containment measures put in place following the discovery of the invasive alga, didymo, in South Island rivers in 2004.

It is currently owned by the city of Durand and leased by Durand Union Station, Inc. a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation, restoration, and maintenance of the building and its surrounding property. The building also houses three small railroad history museums: the Michigan Railroad History Museum (which doubles as a gift shop), the Grand Trunk Western Railroad Museum, and the Ann Arbor Railroad History Museum.

He was born in Maassluis, South Holland, and now lives in Brielle. Career After working as a process operator for Shell Chemicals, Verhaas qualified as a class 1 snooker referee in 1990. In 1989 he had been helping at tournaments at a friend's snooker club in Rotterdam, when referee Michael Clarke advised him about refereeing and encouraged him to qualify. His first professional match as a snooker referee was in 1993 (between Tony Drago and Steve Davis). In 2003 he became the first man from outside the United Kingdom to referee the final of the World Snooker Championship, and he refereed the 2006 World Final between Peter Ebdon and Graeme Dott. Verhaas was in control of all three Masters finals which the late Paul Hunter won, and he describes them as his most memorable matches. During his time as a snooker referee, Verhaas has occasionally been involved in controversy. On 21 January 2007, he was the referee of the final of the Masters between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Ding Junhui, in which he ejected at least one fan from Wembley Arena for heckling the 19-year-old Chinese player. On 19 January 2012, at the Masters, Verhaas mistakenly stopped Graeme Dott in the middle of a break to adjust the score, before realising he made an error and the score was in fact correct. After apologising to Dott, the player then missed his next shot and went on to lose the frame, and the match. Verhaas played a notable role in Ronnie O'Sullivan's record 10th maximum break on 20 September 2010 at the World Open. After finding out that there was no special prize for completing a 147, O'Sullivan shook hands with opponent Mark King after potting the last pink. Verhaas, however, persuaded O'Sullivan to pot the last black and finish his break. For several years he also refereed nine-ball pool tournaments organised by Matchroom Sport. This included several appearances at the Mosconi Cup and the initial Matchroom-organised 1999 World Professional Pool Championship, which was won by Efren Reyes. He was elected as a board member of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association in 2016.

Current crowding is one of the limiting factors of efficiency of light emitting diodes. Materials with low mobility of charge carriers, e.g. Aluminium gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP), are especially prone to current crowding phenomena. It is a dominant loss mechanism in some LEDs, where the current densities especially around the P-side contacts reach the part of the emission characteristics with lower brightness/current efficiency. Current crowding can lead to localized overheating and formation of thermal hot spots, in catastrophic cases leading to thermal runaway. Nonhomogenous distribution of current also aggravates electromigration effects and formation of voids (see e.g. Kirkendall effect). Formation of voids causes localized nonhomogeneity of current density, and the increased resistance around the void causes further localized temperature rise, which in turn accelerates the formation of the void. Conversely, localized lowering of current density may lead to deposition of the migrated atoms, leading to further lowering of current density and further deposition of material and formation of hillocks, which may cause short circuits. In large bipolar transistors, the resistance of the base layer influences the distribution of current density through the base region, especially at the emitter side. Current crowding occurs especially at the areas of localized lowered resistance, or in areas where the field strength is concentrated (e.g. at the edges of layers).

It has been used medically to help with smoking cessation. Its molecular structure has some similarity to that of nicotine and it has similar pharmacological effects. Like varenicline, cytisine is a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Cytisine has a short half-life of 4.8 hours, and is rapidly eliminated from the body. The use of cytisine for smoking cessation remains relatively unknown outside Eastern Europe, however, it is currently being investigated in clinical trials in the United States, being conducted by Achieve Life Sciences.  Sources  Plant species that contain cytisine are found in several genera of the subfamily Faboideae of the family Fabaceae, including Laburnum, Anagyris, Thermopsis, Cytisus, Genista, Retama and Sophora. Cytisine is also present in Gymnocladus of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae.  Uses  =Smoking cessation= As a pharmaceutical preparation called Tabex or Desmoxan, cytisine has been used in Eastern Europe available for the treatment of tobacco smoking. Cytisine is also available in Canada under the brand name Cravv. Cytisine has some structural and pharmacological similarities to the smoking cessation drug varenicline. Cytisine is an acetylcholine agonist, and has strong binding affinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It is extracted from the seeds of Cytisus laborinum L. (Golden Rain acacia) and has been available in former socialist economy (FSE) countries for more than 40 years as an aid to smoking cessation under the brand name Tabex produced by the Bulgarian pharmaceutical company Sopharma AD. It was first marketed in Bulgaria in 1964 and then became widely available in FSE countries. In Poland it is sold under the brand name Desmoxan. In 2011, a randomized controlled trial with 740 patients found cytisine improved 12-month abstinence from nicotine from 2.4% with placebo to 8.4% with cytisine. A 2013 meta-analysis of eight studies demonstrated that cytisine has similar effectiveness to varenicline but with substantially lower side effects. A 2014 systematic review and economic evaluation concluded that cytisine was more likely to be cost-effective for smoking cessation than varenicline. =Recreational= Plants containing cytisine, including the scotch broom and mescalbean, have also been used recreationally. Positive effects are reported to include a nicotine-like intoxication. =Reagent for organic chemistry= (-)-Cytisine extracted from Laburnum anagyroides seeds was used as a starting material for the preparation of \\"(+)-sparteine surrogate,\\" for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched lithium anions of opposite stereochemistry to those anions obtained from sparteine. Toxicity Cytisine can interfere with breathing and cause death; i.v., in mice is about 2 mg/kg.The Merck Index, 10th Ed. (1983) p.402, Rahway: Merck & Co. Cytisine is also teratogenic. MƒÅmane (Sophora chrysophylla) can contain amounts of cytisine that are lethal to most animals. The palila (Loxioides bailleui, a bird), Uresiphita polygonalis virescens and Cydia species (moths), and possibly sheep and goats are not affected by the toxin for various reasons, and use mƒÅmane, or parts thereof, as food. U. p. virescens caterpillars are possibly able to sequester the cytisine to give themselves protection from getting eaten; they have aposematic coloration which would warn off potential predators.

The company was founded by Robert Barclay at Stobcross in Glasgow, Scotland during 1818.Grace's Guide: Barclay Curle In 1862, the company built a large engineering works at Stobcross in Glasgow. In 1876, the company moved their yard down the river to Whiteinch. It was incorporated in 1884 as Barclay Curle. In 1912, Barclay Curle acquired the nearby Elderslie Shipyard in Scotstoun from John Shearer & Sons, to take the excess orders that the firm's existing Clydeholm yard in Whiteinch could not handle. Barclay Curle itself was acquired in 1912 by Swan Hunter. In 1913, the North British Diesel Engine Works was built at the company's Clydeholm Shipyard in Whiteinch, a seminal modernist building designed by Karl Bernhard and supervised by John Galt that was influenced by Peter Behrens' 1909 AEG turbine factory in Berlin and continues to stand today. In 1920 a large Titan Crane was constructed on the quayside adjacent to the engine works at the Clydehom Yard by Sir William Arrol & Co. to enable transfer of engines for fitting out of ships berthed alongside. It remains one of four examples to remain on the River Clyde, along with those at Finnieston, Clydebank and Greenock. During the First World War the Barclay Curle yard built several Insect class gunboats for the Royal Navy. The Swan Hunter owned Barclay Curle ceased building ships in its Clydeholm Shipyard at Whiteinch, Glasgow in 1968, focusing its operations on its Tyneside yards. The Elderslie Dockyard, which lay further west on the other side of Scotstoun and operated by Barclay Curle, was acquired by Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1974. The North British Diesel Engine Works continued and was purchased by the marine engineering company Sulzer until it was nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders under the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 and transferred production to naval weapon systems by British Aerospace (Sea Dart and Sea Wolf missiles) in the late 1970s, finally becoming an industrial estate in the mid-1980s.

The car takes its name from the mythical Yamata no Orochi 8-headed Japanese dragon.mitsuoka-orochi.com. Yamata-no-Orochi is a dragon like serpent,... Accessed 2008-08-28. Mitsuoka says \\"Orochi is the car to ride to gather attention from everyone\\", and categorizes this car as a \\"Fashion-Super Car\\". Development and design Mitsuoka Orochi The Orochi was originally unveiled at the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show as a concept car based on the Honda NSX platform. Mitsuoka unveiled a new convertible version at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show, calling it the Orochi Nude Top. In October 2006, Mitsuoka officially launched the production version of the Orochi. Production was limited to 400 units over four years. The first Orochis were set to be delivered in January 2007. The name Orochi is derived from Yamata no Orochi, a legendary eight-headed eight-tailed Japanese dragon. =Interior= The Orochi's interior is fully trimmed with leather. The car is also equipped with motorized wing mirrors and windows, A/C, airbags, low-beam side HID, an immobilizer, and a Panasonic satnav. Variants =Orochi Kabuto= A Mitsuoka Kabuto at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show At the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, Mitsuoka unveiled the as a concept car. The Kabuto retained the Orochi's basic construction, but has been fitted with carbon fiber panels, a body kit, and a rear spoiler. The Orochi Kabuto was later released as a production car in 2009, and was limited to five cars. Like the concept car, the production Orochi Kabuto was equipped with carbon fiber body panels, a body kit, and a rear spoiler. The car was also given four tail pipes for its exhaust system to enhance exhaust noise. The engine was further tuned to produce more power. The interior saw updates as well; several interior parts were replaced with aluminium counterparts. The seats in the Orochi Kabuto were leather with diamond stitching. =Orochi Zero= As a cheaper alternative to the Orochi, Mitsuoka launched the in January 2008. The Orochi Zero had fewer metal-plated accessory parts, synthetic leather, and reduced soundproofing around the engine to reduce costs. The Zero's exterior paint and interior leather colour were also not customisable. Production was limited to 20 Orochi Zeros per year. =Orochi Gold Premium= In 2010, Mitsuoka revealed the model of the Orochi. Limited to 20 vehicles, the car was made available first in Japan and then to a wider Asian market. The Gold Premium model has both an additional front and rear spoiler and modified variable note exhaust system with four tail pipes as opposed to two on the standard Orochi. The interior now uses alcantara on the seats and steering wheel. On the exterior, the Orochi Gold Premium has been given a new paint job with gold trim and badges, from which it derives its name. =Orochi Final Edition= In April 2014, Mitsuoka announced that the Orochi is due to be discontinued. It also revealed that in order to celebrate its production run, a Final Edition was unveiled. Only five cars will be produced. This car features two exclusive paint hues, Gold Pearl and a purple hue called 'Fuyoru' by the company. Three cars will be painted in Gold Pearl, with the other two will be painted in Fuyoru. It also features exclusive black-painted alloy wheels that are not found on other Orochis. Other cosmetic differences include a new front lip spoiler and a rear wing. The interior also gains new colour-specific trims. Cars painted in Gold Pearl will have a centre console with an Ash Grey and Dark Red colour combination, complete with Alcantara-wrapped seats and steering wheel. Fuyoru- coloured cars get an Ash Grey-coloured centre console, with a similar Alcantara seat trim and contrasting purple stitching. The engine does not have any power upgrades. The vehicle will be priced at approximately US$125000 =Seven Eleven Evangelion Limited Edition= In November 2014 another edition was announced, with a striking multi-coloured paint scheme designed to invoke the giant robots from the 1990s Evangelion anime series. It is based on the Gold Premium platform, will be limited to one car, and sell for 16 million yen (USD $151,022). =Orochi Devilman= In September 2018, Mitsuoka collaborated with Go Nagai, creator of Devilman Crybaby, to create the Orochi Devilman, modeled after a car from the anime series. It is limited to one car and will sell for 19.8 million yen (USD $175,364). Reception The Mitsuoka Orochi has been widely panned by American and English reviewers. Commonly called the \\"World's Ugliest Car\\" by Jalopnik, the Orochi has been greatly criticized for its appearance and design. Not all reviewers were as harsh, however.

With the likes of Arthur Young and Jacques Necker among its honorary members, the Society was \\"supposed to publicize advanced methods of farming and estate management as practiced in foreign countries.\\"John T. Alexander. Catherine the Great: Life and Legend. Oxford University Press, 1989. . Page 100. Despite the Society's self-professed independence, the mastermind behind its early activity was Catherine II of Russia, who viewed agriculture as the mainstay of Russia's economy. She endowed the Society with funds for a library and a building on Palace Square; it was she who secretly suggested a famous essay competition on the subject \\"What is more beneficial to society ‚Äî that the peasant should have land as property, or only movable property, and how far should the right of property be extended?\\" In this international competition, held in 1766, only five essays out of 160 were in Russian; some entries (including Voltaire's) were singularly conservative; others were too libertine to be printed (e.g., Professor Desnitsky of the Moscow University declared that \\"worst of all is the serf who could not own even the smallest bit of property\\"). Encouraged by the success of this venture, the Society subsequently sponsored 243 other essay competitions.  19th century  Nikolay Mordvinov was the Society's president between 1823 and 1840. Early members of the society ‚Äî including agriculturist Andrey Bolotov, general Mikhail Kutuzov, admiral Aleksey Senyavin, and poet Gavrila Derzhavin ‚Äî largely shared the Physiocratic ideals then prevalent in France. They were anxious to spread the cultivation of potatoes in the Russian countryside and hailed the new crop as \\"ground apples\\". During the Napoleonic Wars, attention shifted to agricultural developments in Great Britain. Under the direction of Admiral Mordvinov (1823‚Äì40), the Society acquired British agricultural machinery and sought to intervene into traditional farming techniques as practiced by Russian peasants. Mordvinov himself was \\"an Anglophile so fanatic that he imported the \\"best\\" English gravel to cover the roads of his estates.\\"Esther Kingston-Mann. In Search of the True West: Culture, Economics, and Problems of Russian Development. Princeton University Press, 1998. . Page 66. After Konstantin Kavelin was elected President in 1861, the Free Economic Society concentrated on discussing the future of the Russian village commune (obshchina). The Society gathered statistics about agricultural production in Imperial Russia, compared the economic well-being of various regions, contributed to the mapping of soils in Russia, and published Vasily Dokuchayev's famous monograph on chernozem. Such luminaries as Dmitry Mendeleyev, Aleksandr Butlerov, Pyotr Semyonov, and Leo Tolstoy were involved in the Society's practical activities, ranging from the advancement of beekeeping (Butlerov) to the enlightenment of peasant children (Tolstoy).  Last decades  In 1895 Count Geiden became the Society's President. Under his guidance, the Society evolved into \\"an expanded cultural center, in which academics, agricultural experts, journalists, and leading spokesmen of the feuding socialist groups argued rather freely about current economic and political issues\\"Reinhard Bendix. Kings Or People: Power & the Mandate to Rule. University of California Press, 1980. . Page 542. Public debates of Pyotr Struve and Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky on the precepts of Legal Marxism attracted many non-members (Maksim Gorky, Yevgeny Tarle) to attend the meetings. Such activities resulted in the liberal institution's being closed down by the authorities in 1900. The Society resumed its activities before long, but non-members would not be admitted to take part in the meetings again. With the outbreak of World War I, the activity of the Society was suspended; it was finally abolished by the Bolsheviks in 1919. During 154 years of its existence, the Society issued a variety of specialized journals, more than 280 volumes of the Proceedings, and a number of supplements to these. In 1992, the All-Soviet Economic Society, which had been functioning in the USSR since 1982, assumed the name of the Free Economic Society of Russia, with the Moscow mayor Gavriil Popov as its President.

From this point of view, he is a figure closely related to his appearance and has been opposed to the monarchy of the royal family since King Gyeongdeok. Hyegong of Silla was appointed to Sangdaedeung in 780 (King Seongdeok 1) for his work to calm down the turmoil at the end of King Hyegong's reign. In 780, Wonseong fought alongside his kinsman Kim Yang- sang to defeat the rebellion of Kim Ji-jeong. The rebellion left King Hyegong dead, and Kim took the throne as King Seondeok. The new king gave Wonseong the title of sangdaedeung. After Seondeok died without an heir, the nobles chose Wonseong as the new king. In 787, Wonseong sent tribute to Tang China and requested a title. In 788, he established the national civil service examination for the first time, on the Tang model. After his death in 798, the king was buried south of Bongdeoksa.

Population: 21,400 (1972). History It was founded in 1702 on the spot of the village of Mokrishvitsa, where Peter the Great had established the Olonets Shipyard. In 1703, the first ship of the Baltic Fleet was built here‚Äîa 28-cannon frigate called Shtandart. In 1704, six more frigates, four shnyavas, four galleys, and twenty-four semi-galleys were constructed, which would form the first Russian squadron in the Baltic Sea. Over four hundred sailboats and rowboats were built throughout the shipyard's existence. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Lodeynoye Pole was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known from 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, it was transferred to the newly established Novgorod Governorate, and in 1776, it was further transferred into newly established Olonets Oblast. In 1781, Olonets Oblast was transferred to St. Petersburg Governorate, and in 1784, it was transformed into an independent administrative unit, Olonets Viceroyalty. In 1785, Lodeynoye Pole was granted an uyezd town status. 1788 coat of arms of Lodeynoye Pole In 1799, Olonets Viceroyalty was abolished and divided between Novgorod and Arkhangelsk Governorates. Lodeynopolsky Uyezd was merged into Olonetsky Uyezd. In 1801, Olonets Governorate was established, and in 1802, Lodeynopolsky Uyezd was restored. In 1922, Olonets Governorate was abolished and Lodeynopolsky Uyezd was transferred to Petrograd Governorate (later Leningrad Oblast). On August 1, 1927, the uyezds in Leningrad Oblast were abolished and Lodeynopolsky District, with the administrative center in Lodeynoye Pole, was established. It was a part of Lodeynoye Pole Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. In 1931, the infamous Soviet concentration camp Svirlag was established, with the headquarters in the former Alexander-Svirsky Monastery, several kilometers from Lodeynoye Pole. Thousands of victims (to a great extent Russian Orthodox clergy) lost there their lives.

Background Roman Hispania (Iberia) in approx. 10 AD During the Punic wars, after the defeat of Hannibal the Romans decided to deprive Carthage of its most valuable possession, Hispania. After the defeat of the Carthaginians by Scipio Africanus in eastern Hispania, the pacification of western Hispania was led by Consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus. He obtained the alliance of Olisipo (which sent men to fight alongside the Roman legions against the northwestern Celtic tribes) by integrating it into the Roman Republic in 138 BC. Between 31 BC and 27 BC the city became a Municipium.http://www.portugalromano.com/2011/01/museu-da-cidade-lisboa/ Local authorities were granted self-rule over a territory that extended . Exempt from taxes, its citizens (belonging to the Galeria tribe) were given the privileges of Roman citizenship (Civium Romanorum), and the city was integrated within the Roman province of Lusitania (whose capital was Emerita Augusta). Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus also fortified the city, building city walls as a defence against Lusitanian raids and rebellions. Among the majority of Latin speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves. Lisbon's name was written Ulyssippo in Latin by the geographer Pomponius Mela. The city population is estimated to have been around 30,000 at the time. Earthquakes were documented in 60 BC, several between 47 and 44 BC, several in 33 AD, and a strong quake in 382 AD, but the exact amount of damage to the city is unknown. The city =Buildings= During the time of Augustus (63 BC to 14 AD) the Romans built a large theatre (which was restored in 57 AD on the order of Caius Heius Primus). The galleries underneath the current Rua da Prata date from 20‚Äì35 AD; they were rebuilt in 330 AD.http://hemerotecadigital.cm- lisboa.pt/OBRAS/RevMunicipal/N49/N49_master/N49.pdf The Thermae Cassiorum (Cassian Baths, relating to Quintus Cassius Longinus and Lucius Cassius) were built in 44 AD. The building was renovated in 336 AD.http://www.igespar.pt/media/uploads/revistaportuguesadearqueologia/12_2/191_207.pdfhttps://smobile.blogs.sapo.pt/199119.htmlhttp://eda- bea.es/pub/record_card_1.php?order=3&page;=917&rec;=21280 Several temples were built in the city, dedicated to Jupiter, Concordia, Livia, Diana or Minerva (on the castle hill), Cybele (near current Largo da Madalena), Tethys (current S√£o Nicolau church) and Phrygiae (an uncommon cult from Asia Minor), to the Imperial Cult and to Vestal Virgins (in Chelas). A large necropolis from the 1st‚Äì4th centuries AD existed under Pra√ßa da Figueirahttp://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/8130/2/5_Disserta%C3%A7%C3%A3o.pdf and it is known that a large forum (probably in current Largo dos L√≥is) and an aqueduct were built. A circus and hippodrome was built around the 3rd or 4th century AD. Buildings such as insulae (multi-storied apartment buildings) existed in the area between the modern Castle Hill and downtown. The city wall was strengthened in the 4th to 5th century AD, and around the city there were also bridges (in Sacav√©m and Alc√¢ntara) and villae.

Wine, salt and the city's famously fast horses were also exported. The city came to be very prosperous through suppression of piracy and technological advances, which allowed a boom in the trade with the newly Roman Provinces of Britannia (particularly Cornwall) and the Rhine, and through the introduction of Roman culture to the tribes living by the river Tagus in the interior of Hispania. The city was connected by a broad road to Western Hispania's two other large cities, Bracara Augusta in the province of Tarraconensis (today's Portuguese Braga), and Emerita Augusta, the capital of Lusitania (now M√©rida in Spain). =Government= The city was ruled by an oligarchical council dominated by two families, the Julii and the Cassiae. The Caecilli also held some power. Petitions are recorded addressed to the governor of the province in Emerita and to Emperor Tiberius, such as one requesting help dealing with \\"sea monsters\\" allegedly responsible for shipwrecks. Around 80 BC, the Roman Quintus Sertorius led a rebellion against the dictator Sulla. During this period, he organized the tribes of Lusitania (and Hispania) and was on the verge of forming an independent province in the Sertorian War when he died. The city was administered by two duumviri and two aediles. * Lucius Iulius Maelo Caudicus was one of the duumviri in the 1st century AD. * Lucius Iulius Iustus (son of Lucius Iulius Reburrus) was one of the city aedils in the 1st or 2nd century AD. Between 140 and 150 Lucius Statius Quadratus, a governor, was in Olisipo. In 185 Sextus Tigidius Perennis, governor of Lusitania, visited the region. Between 200 and 209 Junius Celanius, a governor, also came to Olisipo. Lucidius was the native Roman governor of the city in 468, having helped the Suebi under Remismund to take it. =Religion= Olisipo, like most great cities in the Western Empire, was a centre for the dissemination of Christianity. Its first attested Bishop was St. Potamius (c. 356), and there were several martyrs killed during persecutions, such as the Diocletianic Persecution; Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia are the most significant names. According to legend the three were sons of a Roman senator, martyred in Lisbon in the 4th century, under the Roman governor Ageian or Tarquinius in the time of Emperor Diocletian. A temple was then built in the Campolide area, whose ruins still existed in the Middle Ages. In the middle of the 4th century the Olisipo diocesis was formed.http://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/3855/1/ulfl096138_tm.pdf There is also the legend of Saint Gin√©s (S√£o Gens), presented as one of the first martyr bishops of Lisbon and remembered in the Nossa Senhora do Monte chapel. At the end of Roman rule, Olisipo was one of the first Christian cities.

In 457, while Framta was still ruling, Maldras led a large raid on Lusitania.Thompson, 167. The raiders sacked Lisbon by pretending to come in peace and, once admitted by the citizens, plundering the city.Thompson, 171. In 468 the city of Lisbon was occupied by the Suebi under Remismund with the help of a native Roman governor named Lucidius, but in effect Roman dominion over the city had ended.

It is presented by Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis, and is also referred to as Punt and Dennis: It's Been a Bad Week. More than 100 episodes have been broadcast , the latest series ending on 22 June 2006. Mitch Benn has since confirmed the show has \\"bitten the dust\\". It was normally broadcast on Thursdays at 10pm, with each episode being repeated on Saturdays at 1:30pm. The show was recorded the week of broadcast at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. The show was co-presented by regular guests Mitch Benn, Toby Longworth (Series 6 onwards), Sue Perkins (Series 6 onwards) and Simon Greenall (Series 8 onwards). Past co-presenters have been Mervyn Stutter (Series 1-2), Jon Culshaw (Series 1-5), Emma Clarke (Series 1-5) and Jo Caulfield (Series 6), although these varied in some weeks. One famous guest appearance was Canadian comedy legend Leslie Nielsen (series 3, episode 8). The other contributor to the show was their fictional sound effects man, \\"Van Man\\", so called because he supplied the sound effects from his white van, \\"illegally parked outside Ronnie Scott's.\\" It‚Äôs Been a Bad Week is a mock awards show, where true stories and urban legends alike compete for the tongue-twisting \\"The Worst Week of the Week Award, Awarded Weekly, on a Week-By-Week Basis\\". Episodes are sometimes repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra. TOC Format Each show originally began with the \\"Bad Week Round-up\\", which is described as the section for \\"Bad Week stories they couldn't fit anywhere else\\". This was a quick two-minute recap of what had been going on in the news that week. This was later replaced with \\"Van Man's Week of Sound\\", where Van Man illustrated that week's news with his sound effects. Currently, Van Man just plays the main sound effect of the week. A recurring gag is that Van Man's sound effect seems to refer to one of the week's main news stories but actually refers to a different one. The show consists of three sections, \\"Sections 1, 2 and 3\\". In each section, there are three or sometimes four stories from around the world of bad things which have really happened. Usually each section consists of one story related by Punt, one by Dennis and one by another presenter. Benn normally chooses a music-related candidate and sings a song relating to it, Longworth or Greenall often do stories about dumb criminals (frequently American), and Perkins covers something sexual. Sometimes there will be a \\"Bad Week Update\\", where a story previously featured returns, because either the same thing has happened again or a new aspect to the story has surfaced. In every section, Van Man illustrates each story with his sound effects. Originally he also chose the winner of each section; now it is done by a topical \\"guest announcer\\" (impersonated). After the three finalists are chosen, the audience take their electronic keypads (also fictional) and vote for the winner of \\"The Worst Week of the Week Award, Awarded Weekly, on a Week-By-Week Basis\\".

It is one of nine dams on the Tennessee River owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the mid-1960s to replace the outdated Hales Bar Dam upstream. The dam impounds the Nickajack Lake and feeds into Guntersville Lake. Nickajack Dam is named for a Cherokee village once located just upstream from the dam (the site is now submerged). The village was the namesake for Nickajack Cave, which was partially flooded by the reservoir.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Nickajack Project: A Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, Initial Operations, and Costs, Technical Report No. 16 (Knoxville, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1972), pp. 1-9, 32-34, 284. Location Nickajack Dam is located above the mouth of the Tennessee River, near the point where the states of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama meet. This stretch of the river marks a region where the river begins to exit the once treacherous Tennessee River Gorge en route to the flatlands around Guntersville, Alabama. The Sequatchie River empties into the dam's tailwaters, and the city of South Pittsburg is just over downstream from the dam. Nickajack Lake stretches northeast for over , all the way to the base of Chickamauga Dam in Chattanooga. Tennessee State Highway 156 passes just south of Nickajack Dam, and Interstate 24 passes a few miles to the north. Capacity Nickajack Dam is high and long. Its reservoir has of shoreline and of water surface. The dam's 10 spillway bays have a combined discharge of . The electrical generating capacity of Nickajack is 104 megawatts.Tennessee Valley Authority, Nickajack Reservoir. Retrieved: 15 January 2009. Nickajack is serviced by a auxiliary lock that can lift or lower as many as nine large barges at a time between Guntersville Lake and Nickajack Lake. The dam's original design allowed for an main lock beside the auxiliary, but it was never completed. This lock, as well as every lock on the Tennessee River, is operated and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Background and construction TVA's design plan for Nickajack Dam, circa 1964 Before the completion of Hales Bar Dam in 1913, the Tennessee River Gorge was one of the major impediments-- along with Muscle Shoals and the Elk River shoals-- to year-round navigation on the Tennessee River. Along with unpredictable water levels, the gorge was filled with numerous water hazards, some of which had been given nicknames such as \\"The Suck\\", \\"The Skillet\\", and \\"The Pan.\\" In the early 1900s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers realized that a dam near the southwestern end of the gorge would flood the water hazards and eliminate the gorge's rapid downstream current. Chattanooga engineer Josephus Conn Guild offered to raise funds to build this dam in exchange for rights to the dam's electrical output. After receiving authorization from Congress in 1904, he organized the Chattanooga and Tennessee River Power Company (later TEPCO) in 1905, and the company began building Hales Bar Dam in October of that year.Gilbert Govan and James Livingood, The Chattanooga Country, 1540-1962: From Tomahawks to TVA (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1963), pp. 445-447. Hales Bar's weak limestone foundation-- which hadn't been considered in the selection of the dam site-- presented numerous obstacles from the outset, but the dam was finally completed in 1913. Aerial view of Nickajack's lock In 1939, after a contentious court battle, TEPCO was forced to sell its assets-- including Hales Bar Dam-- to the Tennessee Valley Authority.Timothy Ezzell, \\"Jo Conn Guild.\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 15 January 2009. The dam had been leaking since its construction, and TVA immediately initiated a series of foundation improvements that by 1943 had succeeded in halting the leaks. In 1960, however, the leaks had returned, spilling at an alarming . Around the same time, TVA began expanding locks on its dams to at least to accommodate the increase in traffic the river had experienced since World War II, and it was determined that expanding the Hales Bar lock would be \\"prohibitively\\" expensive. Rather than spend the necessary expenses to upgrade Hales Bar, a decision was made in 1963 to build a new dam altogether on a more solid bedrock a few miles downstream. The Nickajack Dam project was authorized January 9, 1964, and construction began April 1, 1964. Funding set aside for repair work on Hales Bar was transferred to the Nickajack project. The reservoir's construction-- which basically involved extending the Hales Bar Reservoir downstream to Nickajack-- required the purchase of , of which had to be cleared. 82 families and of roads had to be relocated. Two generators and several switchyard parts were moved from Hales Bar Dam to the new dam. Construction was completed on December 14, 1967, at a cost of $73 million. Operations at Hales Bar Dam were halted the following day, and by September 1968, Hales Bar Dam had been dismantled and its reservoir merged with Nickajack Lake.

He sustained injuries in a crash which hampered his later football career. In the late 1940s and 1950s he played as a defender for Charlton Athletic, Dartford, Headington United (later Oxford United) and Kidderminster Harriers. He lived in Cheltenham in the 1950s, where he founded the heavy machinery company Liner-Croker Ltd. The company, specializing in earth-moving equipment, grew successfully throughout the 1960s. He sold the company in 1973. The Football Association, anxious to improve the commercial aspects of football, appointed him Secretary in 1973 to succeed the retiring Denis Follows. The position was effectively that of Chief Executive, overseeing the day-to-day running of the FA.

Various Hispanic groups in the United States still use the term. The Raza Unida Party was active as a political party representing Mexican- American racial identity politics in the 1970s. The Hispanic advocacy organization National Council of La Raza was formed in 1968 (renamed to UnidosUS in 2017). La Raza was the name of a Chicano community newspaper edited by Eliezer Risco in 1968. Risco was one of the \\"LA Thirteen\\", a group of young Mexican-American men who were political activists identified by the government as being leaders of a Brown Power movement in Los Angeles. Raul Ruiz joined the staff of La Raza while a student at California State University, Los Angeles. Other community newspapers of the time were Inside Eastside and Chicano Student Movement. Ruiz, a key journalist in the movement, eventually became the editor of La Raza. It became the most influential Chicano-movement publication in southern California. The publications filled a void: for the most part, there had heretofore been no media coverage of any type for the Brown Power movement and its activities. The movement's own print-media publications were really the only forum that the Brown Power movement had to keep party members informed about what was going on in the movement across the Los Angeles area. The lack of the mainstream media coverage contributed to silencing the movement and its activities, unlike with the Black Power movement; the latter received much more coverage, which contributed to that movement's success in spreading their message and growing their movement.

The station began broadcasting in 1959 and was the first commercial FM station in the Hartford radio market. The station is owned by John Fuller's Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, with studios are located on Blue Hills Avenue in Bloomfield, Connecticut with other radio stations and transmitter site in Meriden, Connecticut. History WDRC- FM traces its roots to the Doolittle Radio Company, which established what would become WDRC in 1922. In 1941, Doolittle upgraded an experimental FM station to a commercial license and used the call letters WDRC-FM. Doolittle sold the FM station in 1956 to General Broadcasting Corporation and the AM station in 1959 to Buckley Broadcasting. Buckley inherited a second FM license, which it used to establish the current WDRC-FM. The original WDRC-FM is now WHCN. The current WDRC-FM was issued a program test authority by the FCC on October 26, 1959. It officially signed on at 8:15 p.m. that same day. On August 31, 1966, WDRC-FM increased power from 7,000 to 17,500 watts, then to 50,000 watts the following May. It began broadcasting in stereo in September 1969. In 1973, the station began calling itself \\"Big D 103,\\" and employed a Top 40 format. In 1977, the station flipped to album rock, with a much deeper playlist than its rivals WCCC and WHCN. However, by 1979, the station leaned Rock/AC, and then abruptly flipped back to Top 40 in early 1980. By 1984, WDRC-FM was an oldies-based Adult Contemporary station, but only played oldies on the weekends. Due to positive listener feedback, on September 26, 1986, WDRC-FM became an oldies station full-time.R&R; archive At that point, the station focused on hits of 1964 to 1969, with about four songs per hour from the 1955-63 era. The station also played about one song from the early 1970s per hour. The AM station also offered oldies until 1990. Core artists included The Beatles, The Four Seasons, Elvis Presley, Supremes, Everly Brothers, Temptations, The Hollies, The Righteous Brothers, and Dion, among others. The station also had quite high ratings, even being number one at least a few times. The format continued throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s virtually unchanged. In August 2000, WDRC-FM stopped using the \\"Big D 103\\" name and became known as \\"Oldies 102.9 DRC-FM.\\" The station stopped referring to themselves as \\"Oldies\\" a short time later. In 2001, WDRC-FM began playing several songs from the 1970s, adding artists like Billy Joel, Doobie Brothers, Eagles, James Taylor, and others into the mix. The station also began adding about a dozen or so songs from the 1980s by oldies artists, playing about one every couple of hours. They also began decreasing music from the pre-1964 era; eventually, all the pre-1964 oldies were eliminated, and a lot of 1980s music was added to the mix, becoming more of a classic hits station. The station also became heavily based in the 1970s, playing only a few 1960s songs per hour along with about the same amount of 1980s hits. To appease traditional oldies fans, WDRC-FM launched an internet radio station playing music from 1955 to 1964. In the winter of 2007, WDRC-FM slowly phased out most of the 1980s music, cutting that back to about one every couple hours. The station also increased the 1964 to 1969 product, making those songs core hits once again on a gradual basis. The amount of 1970s music was cut back slightly to about 5 per hour. The station even brought back select songs from the 1950s and early 1960s, playing them about once every 90 minutes. By 2008, the station began increasing 1980s songs to about one per hour. Its HD-2 station now plays a blend of 1950s and 1960s oldies focusing on the pre-1964 era. In the early 2010s, the main station identified itself as \\"Good Time Rock 'n' Roll\\", while occasionally using in the \\"Big D\\" moniker. Its music playlist once again focused on the 1960s from 1964 on, while also emphasizing 1970s hits and including a few 1980s songs. Jingles were also reintroduced in 2008. In late 2008, the station started adding reverb to the audio chain as well as improving the audio processing, thus improving the overall audio quality of the station. On March 5, 2014, Buckley Broadcasting announced that it would sell its Connecticut radio stations, including WDRC-FM, to Connoisseur Media. The sale was consummated on July 7, 2014 at a price of $7,922,035. On July 7, 2014, WDRC-FM changed their name to \\"102.9 DRC\\", and modified their slogan to \\"Classic Hits of the 70s, 80s and More.\\" In addition, a majority of the station's airstaff was let go. On January 20, 2015, at 10:29 a.m., after briefly stunting with a loop of the old Hartford Whalers theme \\"Brass Bonanza\\", WDRC-FM changed their format to classic rock, branded as \\"102.9 The Whale\\".WDRC-FM Flips to Classic Rock The Whale On January 15, 2018, it was announced that the station was sold to Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation.

During his fifteen-year career he played with the Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds. Walker played in 1,784 major league games over 15 seasons with a career batting average of .294, with 1,991 hits, 124 home runs and 998 RBI. He had 223 stolen bases, finishing nine times among the top ten for the season. He played for the Tigers in two World Series; 1934 when they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals, and 1935 when they beat the Chicago Cubs. Early years Born in Gulfport, Mississippi, Walker attended the University of Mississippi and was a member of the Class of 1930. He played both football and baseball at Ole Miss, and is in both the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and the Ole Miss Sports Hall of Fame. Career Gee ‚Äî a fiery competitor and a clown ‚Äî became a favorite in Detroit. His antics earned him the moniker \\"The Madman from Mississippi.\\" He hit .300 or better in five of his first seven seasons. Though regularly among the league leaders in stolen bases, he could also be inattentive and overzealous on the basepaths. He once tried to steal a base during an intentional walk. In the 1934 World Series, he was picked off first while arguing with the Cardinal bench. Earlier that year, on June 30, he was picked off base twice in the same inning. After Hank Greenberg singled, Walker reached on an error but was caught off base when the catcher threw to first. Greenberg tried to draw a throw by running to third base and was thrown out, with Walker taking second base. Moments later, with Walker standing six feet off the bag, the pitcher threw to second base and Walker was tagged out. Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane was so angered by Walker's inattention that he suspended Walker for 10 days and fined him $20. In 1936, Walker hit .353 ‚Äî the highest batting average of his career and 6th highest in the American League. He also hit 55 doubles ‚Äî second only to his teammate Charlie Gehringer. In 1937, Walker began the season on fire. On Opening Day, he hit for the cycle ‚Äî the only player to accomplish that feat on Opening Day. He did it in reverse order (called an \\"unnatural cycle\\") ‚Äì starting with a home run, followed by triple, then a double and finally a single. He continued his hot hitting with a 27-game streak in April and May, and his fast start put him in the 1937 All- Star Game, although he did not appear in the game. He ended 1937 with a career-high 18 HR, 113 RBIs and .335 average. Despite Walker's strong performance that year, the Tigers (reportedly unhappy with his antics) traded him after the season. They sent two of their most popular players, Walker and Marv Owen, to the White Sox for Vern Kennedy, Tony Piet and Dixie Walker. The trade caused an uproar with Tiger fans, and owner Walter Briggs was forced to issue an announcement from his Miami home that \\"the deal was made with my approval.\\" Walker continued to hit well for several years afterward, but was traded four more times. In December 1939, he was traded to the Washington Senators for Pete Appleton and Taffy Wright. In December 1940, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Doc Cramer and then sent to the Cleveland Indians. While playing for the Cincinnati Reds in 1942, in the second game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals on May 30, Walker collided in the outfield with fellow Mississippi native Harry Craft, and both were unable to finish the game. Their injuries led to the major league debut of Clyde Vollmer the next day. Later years After retiring as a player, Walker served for a year as a coach for the Cincinnati Reds, in 1946. Walker died in 1981 at Mississippi State Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, at age 73 after a long illness. He was survived by four sons, a daughter and two brothers, one of whom, Hub Walker, was also a former major league outfielder, with Detroit and Cincinnati.

History  Matthews was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After graduating from the University of Tulsa in 1959, with a bachelor's degree in engineering physics, Matthews joined the U.S. Marine Corps as an aviator. Matthews' involvement in trying to mesh human voices to technology was many years in the making. A fellow friend and pilot perished in a mid-air collision, which Matthews believed was caused when he momentarily took his eyes off of his plane's controls to adjust his radio frequency. After he was discharged from the military, Matthews went to work for IBM to help develop voice-activated cockpit controls which would help lessen similar types of catastrophic errors in the future. After IBM, Matthews went to work for Texas Instruments in 1966. =Inspiration and first commercial system= Matthews has said that the inspiration for his invention came in 1970, while visiting a client's office on business. He noticed a number of trash bins overflowing with message slips used by receptionists and secretaries to inform their bosses that someone tried to call him while he was in a meeting or otherwise unable to take the call himself. Very quickly, he developed a concept for an electronic system to store and receive messages. His first attempt, he said, \\"...required 64 telephone lines, 114 Intel 8086 microprocessors and four refrigerator-sized 200-megabyte hard drives.\\" The hard part would be to find a company willing to buy an untested system.Stroh, Michael. \\"The face behind voice mail.\\" Baltimore Sun. March 30, 2001.. Retrieved July 6, 2018. Matthews presented his concept at a conference attended by a Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) company executive named James Jensen, who immediately recognized the potential boom in executive productivity offered by the proposed system. By 1980, Jensen had persuaded his superiors to install the first system, which cost about $500,000 to serve about 3,000 users. = Founding of VMX = In 1979, Gordon Matthews founded a company in Texas called ECS Communications. The first VMX system was engineered by John Cayton under the direction of Gordon Matthews. In 1979, Matthews also filed a method patent for voicemail, which was granted on February 1, 1983. Matthews patented what was called \\"Voice Message Exchange,\\" U.S. Patent No. 4,371,752, and was a significant patent for voicemail. While there was prior art for voicemail, Matthews' patent was never adjudicated and held up until its expiration. Matthews eventually held over thirty-five patents, many of which related to voicemail. Matthews later changed the name of his company to VMX Inc. He eventually developed a 3,000-user voice messaging system called the VMX/64. VMX was arguably the first company to offer voicemail for sale commercially for corporate use. Matthews was able to sell his system to several notable large corporations, such as 3M, Kodak, American Express, Intel, Hoffman La Roche, Corning Glass, ARCO, Shell Canada, Zenith Data Systems and Westinghouse. This impressive list of early adopters started the ball rolling on corporate voicemail. While some claim that VMX and Gordon Matthews invented voicemail or that he was the \\"father of voicemail\\", this claim is not true. The first inventor of record was Stephen Boies of IBM in 1973, six years before Matthews filed his first patent. IBM released its first implementation of Speech Filing System (SFS) in 1975, four years before VMX was launched. SMS was later called Audio Distribution System (ADS). Also, Delphi Communications of California first released their Delta 1 system in 1976, three years before the first patent filing by Matthews. = Legacy of VMX = In general, executives loved the voice mail systems, however time revealed some downsides: * While executive productivity may have improved, many secretarial and administrative jobs were eliminated; * Paper notices about calls were eliminated, but VM did not necessarily improve call-backs by recipients; * Information technology (IT) employees were needed to maintain the VM system. * By 1990, articles in the popular press complained about, \\"...\\"voice mail jail\\" ‚Äì being trapped in a labyrinthine series of telephone prompts that never seemed to lead to a human. In 1988, when VMX was on the verge of bankruptcy, it was acquired by Opcom, a designer and seller of computer software products for handling telephone calls. Opcom was acquired in 1994 by Octel Communications, the largest provider of voice mail equipment and services in the world. In 1997, Octel was acquired by Lucent Technologies and spun off several years later as part of Avaya.

Olivia's mother feels she was betrayed by Paul and failed by her own musician father, so she does not want her daughter to be involved in what she sees as the decadent world of rock music. In spite of her mother's attempts to keep them apart, Olivia and Paul get to know each other and become the family they should have been all along.

The first castle on this site was built in the 14th century, but was soon destroyed by the forces of the Archbishop of Utrecht in 1380. The Van Twickelo, Van Renesse and Van Pallandt families have lived in castles on this site since. In the early 1920s, baron Philip van Pallandt deeded the castle and surrounding land to the Order of the Star in the East, an organization connected to the famous philosopher and spiritual teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti, of whom the baron was an avid follower. The Order held annual gatherings of its members in the castle grounds until its dissolution in 1929; the deed to the estate was officially transferred back to the van Pallandt family in 1931, however Krishnamurti continued to occasionally use the estate for lectures and meetings until the outbreak of World War II. During the war the estate had been used as a concentration camp (Camp Erika) by the occupying German forces, and afterwards Krishnamurti felt this precluded its use as a proper meeting space.Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening, Mary Lutyens, 1975, published by Farrar Straus & Giroux, p 276.

A 400-acre parcel was kept by a Krishnamurti-affiliated trust until the end of the war, whereupon it was returned to baron van Pallandt. In 1934, the castle was turned into a school for Jewish children threatened by the Nazi regime. This school, founded by the Quakers, had to be closed under pressure from the German occupiers in 1943.

It is usually an annual five-day event in mid-October and is held in theatre venues located in the Long Island area of New York, United States. Approximately 18,000 visitors attend each festival and close to a hundred films are featured each year, including an annual representation of at least twenty countries and an awards package worth over $200,000. HIFF was founded as a celebration of independent film in a variety of forms, and to provide a forum for independent filmmakers with differing global perspectives. The festival places a particular emphasis upon new filmmakers with a diversity of ideas, as a means to not only provide public exposure for festival content and its creators, but to also inspire and enlighten audiences. The festival has presented films that have subsequently been considered highly successful productions; the 2008 event featured eventual winners of the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Independent Spirit Award \\"Best Picture\\" accolades, and the 2011 season consisted of 24 Academy Award nominations. HIFF primarily showcases short films, documentaries and narrative films and is a qualifying festival for the Academy Awards. The festival offers special presentations, including: \\"Breakthrough Performers\\" showcasing new emerging acting talent; \\"A Conversation With\\", a Q&A; session with a film luminary; and \\"Conflict & Resolution\\" which \\"utilizes the power of cinema to increase understanding of the human realities of war and conflict\\". HIFF offers an awards package worth $165,000. The festival is also involved with other events during the remainder of the year, including screenings in other parts of New York State and an annual Screenwriters Lab.  Screenwriters Lab  The Hamptons Screenwriters‚Äô Lab is an intimate gathering that takes place each Spring in East Hampton. The Lab seeks to develop new screenwriting talent by introducing established writers to emerging screenwriters, the latter having been chosen by the organizers of the film festival and key industry contacts. The mentors advise in a \\"one-on-one\\" laboratory setting, whilst scheduled daily events allow participants to engage with board members, sponsors, the local creative community and other festival supporters. The Lab facilitates the improvement of participating screenwriters' work, as the selected writers consult with industry professionals to attain insight into the mechanisms of the film industry. The Lab actively seeks a broad selection of screenplays that cumulatively address a diversity of subject matter. The Lab also encourages the submission of fresh, innovative screenplays that explore science, technology, mathematics, invention and engineering as part of its partnership with The Alfred P.

With Pellegrino da San Daniele he is one of the main representatives of Renaissance art in the Friuli region of north-east Italy.  Biography  A member of a family of artists, Giovanni was the son of Martin and the grandson of Domenico da Tolmezzo. For many years, he was identified as the painter, also from Udine, who signed John the Baptist and worked in Udine and in the Friuli, between the end of the 15th and early 16th century. Currently these works are attributed to Giovanni Battista da Udine, a follower of Alvise Vivarini. St Mark and Saints, 1501 Chapel of St Mark, Udine Cathedral Dormitio Virginis - detail from the Mortegliano altarpiece Giovanni Martini's first signed work, in 1501, is the altarpiece St. Mark and St. John the Baptist, with Saints Stephen, Jerome, Ermacore, Abbot Anthony, and the Blessed Bertrand, located in the Chapel of St. Mark in Udine Cathedral. This work was highly criticized by Giacomo Gordino, the dean of the chapter of the cathedral, in a letter to Domenico Grimani, Patriarch of Aquileia, complaining of the martial aspect given to St. Mark by the painter, which may be a portrait of Antonio Loredan, lieutenant of Friuli.Alessandro Cosma, MARTINI, Giovanni, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 71 (2008) Another altarpiece, the St. Ursula Altarpiece, dated 1507 on its back, was created for the Saint Peter Martyr church in Udine. These two altarpieces demonstrate Martini's knowledge of the works of Alvise Vivarini and Cima da Conegliano, and are connected with the traditions of Friuli. In 1507 he inherited his father and uncle's workshop and took on the tradition of carved wooden altars, adapting the traditional Gothic style of Friuli to the fashion of the Venetian Renaissance. He completed a wooden altar in 1515 for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Prodolone (in San Vito al Tagliamento). The rhythm of the composition of the statues of this set shows a still strong link with the tradition of the school of Tolmezzo in the Quattrocento. The most representative of Martini's wooden altars is that in Mortegliano,Maurizio Driol, L‚Äôaltare ligneo di Giovanni Martini a Mortegliano , Scheda 2.1.3, Progetto Integrato Cultura del Medio Friuli which he completed in 1526. For this impressive work he was paid the enormous sum for the time of 1180 ducats. The altar, which stands more than five meters high and is the largest in Friuli, consists of 60 statues. It is divided into registers and subdivided into individual cells, as previously, but it has a spatial continuity through the columns of the architectural framework, as can be seen for example linking the Piet√† group and the Dormitio Virginis. It is regarded not only as the artist's masterpiece, but also as one of the highest expressions of wooden sculpture of the Renaissance. Other examples can be found in the parish churches of Faedis and Remanzacco.  Works  Martini's principal mature painted works are * Holy Family with Simeon (1498), oil on panel, 96 x 71 cm, Museo Correr, Venice * St. Mark and St. John the Baptist, Stephen, Jerome, Ermacora, Abbot Anthony and the blessed Bertrand (1501), Udine Cathedral * Altarpiece of Saint Ursula (1507), created for the church of San Pietro Martire Udinese in Udine, now divided between the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan (central panel), the Civic Museums of Udine (upper part), and a private collection; * Presentation in the Temple (1515), Portogruaro Cathedral (Duomo di Sant'Andrea apostolo); * Altarpiece of Santa Maria in Collevillano (1522), created for the church of the same name at Faedis, now lost; * Presentation in the Temple (1530), Spilimbergo Cathedral.

Early life and background Born in Denver, Colorado on July 4, 1926, she attended Catholic girls schools and graduated from University of Denver in 1947 and then spent three years teaching skiing in Aspen, Colorado. Career In 1950, she made the first ski ascent of Mount Columbia, the second highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, and also of Snow Dome, the hydrographic apex of the continent. After marrying Edward LaChapelle, she spent a year with him in Davos, Switzerland from 1950 to 1951, and then they moved to Alta, Utah. In 1952, their son Randy was born in Denver, Colorado (Randy changed his name to David LaChapelle in his adult years). As a family they would rotate three times a year to their homes and workstations in Alta, Utah, where they spent winters and Randy/David was homeschooled; the Olympic Mountains Blue Glacier Washington, where they spent summers; and Kirkland, Washington. Dolores and Ed moved to Silverton, Colorado in 1973 initially because it was here that Ed carried out avalanche research. Later they would separate though they maintained their friendship and professional literary companionship. Ed set up life in Alaska. Dolores, however, enjoyed the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado, the rest of her life. She operated \\"Way of the Mountain center\\" from her home publishing, writing, teaching, skiing, sharing ceremony and music. Dolores was first and foremost a philosopher and researcher. The extent of her research spanned a complex set of topics, which she tracked in a vast library of books and articles. She noted and cross-referenced every text in such a tight web of interrelated material that she would eventually include in her collection, over a dozen thick and hand-typed, three-ring binder compendiums linking it all together. This rare body of research includes hundreds of biographical files chronicling a rich lifetime of mountain climbs, as she climbed all 14K (above 14,000 feet) mountains of Colorado Rockies by age 20, letter correspondence with authors and poets such as Gary Snyder and Art Goodtimes and her overlapping years married to pioneering avalanche and snow scientist Ed LaChapelle. This body of wisdom was stored in Silverton awaiting the opportunity for better archiving and accessibility until July 2011 when the collection's steward, Ananda Foley, (equivalent of Dolores' daughter-in-law) arranged a proper home for this unique collection with Aspen Center for Environmental Studies. Ananda has organized the biographical materials and stories of the LaChapelle lives. A posting of this project can be found at the LaChapelle Legacy website. She looks forward to hearing from persons interested in participating in this biographical project (info current as of July 2012). In 2004 Dolores LaChapelle received the \\"Ski History Maker\\" award from the University of Utah as one of the ten women who figured most prominently in the history of skiing. Of all the women in her field to receive this award, she was the \\"only back-country skier in the bunch\\", according to her close friend Peter. LaChapelle died on January 21, 2007 after an enjoyable evening of Copper River salmon supper with David Grimes who said they enjoying singing \\"Goodnight Irene, Goodnight\\" before she turned in for bed.

The latter two derived it while working on an extension of quaternions called octonions. In algebraic terms the identity means that the norm of product of two octonions equals the product of their norms: \\\\ab\\\\ = \\\\a\\\\\\\\b\\\\. Similar statements are true for quaternions (Euler's four-square identity), complex numbers (the Brahmagupta‚ÄìFibonacci two-square identity) and real numbers. In 1898 Adolf Hurwitz proved that there is no similar bilinear identity for 16 squares (sedenions) or any other number of squares except for 1,2,4, and 8. However, in the 1960s, H. Zassenhaus, W. Eichhorn, and A. Pfister (independently) showed there can be a non-bilinear identity for 16 squares. Note that each quadrant reduces to a version of Euler's four-square identity: :(a_1^2+a_2^2+a_3^2+a_4^2)(b_1^2+b_2^2+b_3^2+b_4^2)= ::(a_1b_1 - a_2b_2 - a_3b_3 - a_4b_4)^2+ ::(a_1b_2 + a_2b_1 + a_3b_4 - a_4b_3)^2+ ::(a_1b_3 - a_2b_4 + a_3b_1 + a_4b_2)^2+ ::(a_1b_4 + a_2b_3 - a_3b_2 + a_4b_1)^2 and similarly for the other three quadrants. By Pfister's theorem, a different sort of eight-square identity can be given where the z_i, introduced below, are non-bilinear and merely rational functions of the x_i, y_i. Thus, :(x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2+x_5^2+x_6^2+x_7^2+x_8^2)(y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2+y_4^2+y_5^2+y_6^2+y_7^2+y_8^2) = z_1^2+z_2^2+z_3^2+z_4^2+z_5^2+z_6^2+z_7^2+z_8^2 where, ::z_1 = x_1 y_1 - x_2 y_2 - x_3 y_3 - x_4 y_4 + u_1 y_5 - u_2 y_6 - u_3 y_7 - u_4 y_8 ::z_2 = x_2 y_1 + x_1 y_2 + x_4 y_3 - x_3 y_4 + u_2 y_5 + u_1 y_6 + u_4 y_7 - u_3 y_8 ::z_3 = x_3 y_1 - x_4 y_2 + x_1 y_3 + x_2 y_4 + u_3 y_5 - u_4 y_6 + u_1 y_7 + u_2 y_8 ::z_4 = x_4 y_1 + x_3 y_2 - x_2 y_3 + x_1 y_4 + u_4 y_5 + u_3 y_6 - u_2 y_7 + u_1 y_8 ::z_5 = x_5 y_1 - x_6 y_2 - x_7 y_3 - x_8 y_4 + x_1 y_5 - x_2 y_6 - x_3 y_7 - x_4 y_8 ::z_6 = x_6 y_1 + x_5 y_2 + x_8 y_3 - x_7 y_4 + x_2 y_5 + x_1 y_6 + x_4 y_7 - x_3 y_8 ::z_7 = x_7 y_1 - x_8 y_2 + x_5 y_3 + x_6 y_4 + x_3 y_5 - x_4 y_6 + x_1 y_7 + x_2 y_8 ::z_8 = x_8 y_1 + x_7 y_2 - x_6 y_3 + x_5 y_4 + x_4 y_5 + x_3 y_6 - x_2 y_7 + x_1 y_8 and, ::u_1 = \\\\frac{(ax_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2)x_5 - 2x_1(bx_1 x_5 + x_2 x_6+ x_3 x_7+ x_4 x_8)}{c} ::u_2 = \\\\frac{(x_1^2+ax_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2)x_6 - 2x_2(x_1 x_5 + bx_2 x_6+ x_3 x_7+ x_4 x_8)}{c} ::u_3 = \\\\frac{(x_1^2+x_2^2+ax_3^2+x_4^2)x_7 - 2x_3(x_1 x_5 + x_2 x_6+ bx_3 x_7+ x_4 x_8)}{c} ::u_4 = \\\\frac{(x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+ax_4^2)x_8 - 2x_4(x_1 x_5 + x_2 x_6+ x_3 x_7+ bx_4 x_8)}{c} with, ::a=-1,\\\\;\\\\; b=0,\\\\;\\\\; c=x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2 Incidentally, the u_i obey the identity, ::u_1^2+u_2^2+u_3^2+u_4^2 = x_5^2+x_6^2+x_7^2+x_8^2  See also  *Pfister's sixteen-square identity *Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction *Hypercomplex number *Latin square External links *Degen's eight-square identity on MathWorld *The Degen‚ÄìGraves‚ÄìCayley Eight-Square Identity *Pfister's 16-Square Identity Analytic number theory Mathematical identities Squares in number theory ","title":"Degen's eight-square identity"},{"id":"4982248","text":"left Lemele is a town in the Dutch province of Overijssel.

The Hiwassee River empties into Chickamauga lake at Hiwassee Island, just north of the Highway 60 bridge at mile 500 (804.5 km). Chickamauga Lake is immediately downstream from Watts Bar Lake and immediately upstream from Nickajack Lake. Full pool for Chickamauga lake is above sea level; the current lake level can be checked here. The normal operating zone is between and through the end of March, rising steadily to a summer range of by the middle of May. Then, full pool is maintained through the end of August, at which time the level drops steadily back down to by the end of November. Actual lake levels vary due to weather conditions and power needs.

The dam is owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the late 1930s as part of a New Deal era initiative to improve navigation and bring flood control and economic development to the Tennessee Valley. The dam impounds the Chickamauga Lake and feeds into Nickajack Lake. The dam and associated infrastructure were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Chickamauga Dam is named for the Chickamaugas, a politically detached branch of the Cherokee whose chief village was located just north of the dam site during the 18th century.TVA: Chickamauga Reservoir fact sheet, TVA website The tribe's name has also been applied to several streams in the Chattanooga area, as well as an important American Civil War battle and a sandbar that existed at the dam site prior to its construction.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Chickamauga Project: A Comprehensive Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, and Initial Operations of the Chickamauga Project, Technical Report No. 6 (Knoxville, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1942), 1-12, 41-43, 49, 246. Location Chickamauga Dam is located upstream from the mouth of the Tennessee River, just east of downtown Chattanooga at the river's confluence with North Chickamauga Creek. The reservoir stretches for from Chickamauga Dam to the base of Watts Bar Dam, and includes parts of Hamilton, Bradley, McMinn, Rhea, and Meigs counties. The reservoir's notable embayments include Harrison Bay at its confluence with Wolftever Creek approximately upstream from the dam and the Soddy Creek embayment at upstream. Along with its main Tennessee River channel, the reservoir is navigable across the lower of the Hiwassee River, which joins the Tennessee River above the dam. The Wilkes T. Thrasher Bridge carries Tennessee State Route 153 across the top of Chickamauga Dam. The road connects the dam to Interstate 75 to the south and U.S. Route 27 to the north. The Tennessee Riverwalk, a walkway along the Tennessee River, begins at the dam. Capacity Generator hall of the powerhouse Chickamauga Dam is a concrete gravity-type dam long and high. Its hydroelectric generating capacity is 119 megawatts. The dam has 18 spillway bays with a combined discharge of . A navigation lock allows barges and other boats to travel past the dam, raising or lowering vessels between Chickamauga and Nickajack reservoirs. Background and construction Design plan for Chickamauga Dam, circa 1935 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the Chickamauga Island site in the 1920s as a possible site for a dam to protect Chattanooga, which had suffered serious flood damage in 1867, 1875, 1886, and 1917, and to enhance navigation along the river. When the Tennessee Valley Authority was formed in the mid-1930s, it assumed control of navigation and flood control operations in the Tennessee Valley. After extensive surveying, TVA chose the tip of Chickamauga Island over several other sites surveyed by the Army Corps in the vicinity. The Chickamauga project was authorized December 31, 1935, and dam construction began January 13, 1936. Map showing the parts (shaded) of downtown Chattanooga flooded when the Tennessee River broke its banks in March 1867 The construction of Chickamauga Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of of land, of which were wooded and had to be cleared. 903 families, 24 cemeteries, and of roads had to be relocated. An embankment was built to protect parts of Dayton, Tennessee from the reservoir's backwaters, and several roads and buildings in the town of Soddy were relocated or modified. A total of 39 bridges affected by the reservoir were either raised or moved. The navigation lock at Chickamauga Dam was designed by the Army Corps of Engineers, and was based on the lock design at Guntersville Dam. The lock was initially , although the dam was designed in a way that allowed a larger lock to be installed if increases in river traffic ever required it. Chickamauga Dam was completed and its gates closed on January 15, 1940, constructed at a cost of $42,065,000. The lock was placed into operation on February 26, 1940, and the first generator went online May 4, 1940. Two recreational areas-- Booker T. Washington State Park and Harrison Bay State Park-- were developed as segregated parks along Chickamauga Lake's shores, with the former originally being for African-Americans and the latter originally being for caucasians. Renovations By the early 2000s, the concrete of the original lock had deteriorated due to \\"concrete growth\\" caused by chemical reactions between its constituent cement and rock aggregate. A $375 million project to replace the lock began in 2003. The new lock was scheduled to be completed by 2014. New lock takes shape at Chickamauga Dam , Chattanooga Times Free Press, August 11, 2008 Progress was hampered, however, by lack of funding due to the depletion of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund that finances U.S. Army Corps of Engineers work on river navigation infrastructure. Some $52 million in additional funding was made available for the project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. By 2013, $183 million had been spent, the total estimated cost of the project had grown to $693 million as a result of delays and increasing costs for construction materials, and an additional five years of work was estimated to remain. The existing lock is expected to become unsafe for continued use some time before 2023. In October 2004 TVA installed a new warning system to alert individuals downstream when the dam is releasing water. The warning measures include strobe lights, signs and alarm horns. TVA conducts periodic maintenance on Chickamauga Dam using sawcut expansion holes, a type of expansion joint used in concrete construction. In 2010, engineering contractor S&ME; used a Geoprobe drill to open and repair the expansion holes and cut new joints.

For example, women are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, while men are more likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Nonbinary or genderqueer identification describes people who do not identify as either male or female. People who identify as nonbinary or gender queer show increased risk for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.Blueprint for the Provision of Comprehensive Care for Trans People and Trans Communities in Asia and the Pacific . Health Policy Project. Retrieved 2019-03-25. People who identify as transgender demonstrate increased risk for depression, anxiety, and post- traumatic stress disorder. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. When considering gender and mental illness, one must look to both biology and social/cultural factors to explain areas in which men and women are more likely to develop different mental illnesses. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women.  Gender differences in mental health  = Gender-specific risk factors = Gender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Some gender-specific risk factors that disproportionately affect women are income inequality, low social ranking, unrelenting child care, gender-based violence, and socioeconomic disadvantages. = Anxiety = Women are two to three times more likely to be diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) than men and have higher self-reported anxiety scores. In the United States, women are two times more likely to be diagnosed with Panic Disorder (PD) than men. Women are also twice as likely to be affected by specific phobias. In addition, Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) occurs among women and men at similar rates. Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD) affects both women and men equally. Anxiety can occur with other mental illnesses. Compared to men, women are more likely to have multiple psychiatric disorders in their lifetimes such as a combination of general anxiety disorder and major depression. As a coping mechanism, 30% of men with anxiety use substances. Women also have a higher chance of having an anxiety disorder earlier than men. Girls have an increased likelihood of having an anxiety disorder than boys. Anxiety during a girl's childhood and adolescence are significantly associated with later depressive episodes and later suicide attempts. In most cases, anxiety treatment is indifferent to sex. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is around 60-70% successful for both women and men. =Depression= Regardless of one's age and country of origin, women are more likely to have depression than men. Major depressive disorder, also known as unipolar depression or MDD, is twice as common in women. Risk factors such as traumatic experiences, gender-based roles, and stress are connected to depression. In the United States and European region, women are more likely to attempt suicide than men. However, the suicide rate in the United States is four times higher for men than women. Another population of women affected by depression is older women. Depression is one of the leading mental disorders of older adults, and women are the majority of older adults with depression. Although men may have similar diagnosing scores to women, the presence of a gender bias results in an increased diagnosis of depression in women than men. According to a World Health Organization report from 2016, the burden of depression falls disproportionately on girls and women.World Health Organization. Out of the shadows: Making mental health a global development priority. 2016 http://www.who.int/mental_health/advocacy/wb_background_paper.pdf?ua=1 Retrieved November 26, 2016. Moreover, women report higher rates of violent victimization, which might contribute to the gender gaps in depression.  Postpartum depression  Men and women experience postpartum depression. Maternal postpartum depression affects around 13% of women. The rates of female postpartum depression are higher in developing countries at around 20%. Paternal postpartum depression (PPPD) affects 1 out of 10 men. It is associated with a decrease in testosterone and an increase in depressive symptoms. Maternal postpartum depression is a significant risk factor of paternal postpartum depression. In the United States, 1 out of 7 women experiences postpartum depression. In some American states, 1 out of 5 women is affected by postpartum depression. = Eating disorders = Women constitute 85-95% of people with anorexia nervosa and bulimia and 65% of those with a binge-eating disorder. Factors that contribute to the gender disproportionality of eating disorders are perceptions surrounding \\"thinness\\" in relation to success and sexual attractiveness and social pressures from mass media that are largely targeted towards women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. It has been found that clinicians are not well-trained and lack sufficient resources to treat men with eating disorders. Men with eating disorders are likely to experience muscle dysmorphia.  Gender differences in adolescence and mental health  Adolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. Children also approach goals differently, which in turn can cause different reactions to stressors such as bullying. = Bullying = Studies have shown that adolescent males are more likely to be bullied than females. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Bj√∂rkqvist et al. showed that the motivation of male bullies between the ages of 14-16 was the status goal of establishing themselves as more dominant. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by Ren√© Veenstra et al. reported that bullies were more likely to be rejected by peer groups who saw them as a possible threat. The study cited an example of a male elementary school bully who was rejected by their female peers for targeting a female student while a male bully who only targeted other males were accepted by females but rejected by their male peers. = Eating disorders = The fashion industry and media have been cited as potential factors in the development of eating disorders in adolescents and pre-adolescents. Eating disorders have been found to be most common in developed countries and per scholars such as Anne Becker, the introduction of television has prompted an increase of eating disorders in media-na√Øve populations. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \\"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women‚Äôs magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\\". Other potential reasons for eating disorders among adolescents and pre- adolescents can include anxiety, food avoidance emotional disorder, food refusal, selective eating, pervasive refusal, or appetite loss as a result of depression. = Suicide = Data has shown that suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents and that gender has an impact on the avenue an adolescent may use when attempting suicide. Males are known more to use guns in their suicide attempts, whereas females are more likely to cut their wrists or take an overdose of pills. Triggers for suicide among adolescents can include poor grades and relationship issues with significant others or family members. Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook can have a significant impact on a user's body-image by inciting body-surveillance. = Effects of Social Media on Body Image = During early adolescence, one's perception of physical appearance becomes increasingly important, having a significant impact on one's self-worth. Studies have shown that social media use among adolescents is associated with poor body image. This is due to the fact that social media use increases body surveillance. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. Both adolescent boys and girls are impacted by the objectifying nature of social media, however young girls are more likely to body surveil due to society's tendency to overvalue and objectify women. A study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence found that there is a significantly stronger correlation between self-objectified social media use, body surveillance, and body shame among young girls than young boys. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth. Consequently, low self-esteem can increase one's risk of developing an eating disorder, depression, and/or anxiety.  Gender differences following a traumatic event  = Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) = Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the most common reactions in response to a traumatic event. Research has found that women have higher rates of PTSD compared to men. According to epidemiological studies, women are two to three times more likely to develop PTSD than men. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is about 10-12% in women and 5-6% in men. Women are also four times more likely to develop chronic PTSD compared to men. There are observed differences in the types of symptoms experienced by men and women. Women are more likely to experience specific sub-clusters of symptoms, such as re-experiencing symptoms (e.g. flashbacks), hypervigilance, feeling depressed and numbness. These differences are found to be persistent across cultures. A significant risk factor or trigger of PTSD is rape. In the United States, 65% of men and 45.9% of women who are raped develop PTSD. Epidemiological studies have found that men are more likely to have PTSD as a result of experiencing combat, war, accidents, nonsexual assaults, natural disaster, and witnessing death or injury. Meanwhile, women are more likely to have PTSD attributed to rape, sexual assault, sexual molestation, and childhood sexual abuse. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to different rates of exposure to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at a greater risk for developing PTSD. Additionally, it has been found that when looking at those who have only experienced sexual assaults, women remained approximately twice as likely as men to develop PTSD. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD. = Depression = While PTSD is perhaps the most well- known psychological response to a trauma, depression can also develop following exposure to traumatic events. Under the definition of sexual assault as pressured or forced into unwanted sexual contact, women encounter two times the rate of sexual assault as men. A history of sexual assault is related to increased rates of depression. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault contributes to 35% of the gender difference in adult depression. Increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood also explains the observed gender difference in major depression. Studies show that women have an increased risk of experiencing traumatic events in childhood, especially childhood sexual abuse. This risk has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression. As with PTSD, evidence of a biological difference between men and women may contribute to the observed gender difference. However, research on the biological differences of men and women who have experienced traumatic events is yet to be conclusive.  Gender differences in mental health within the LGBTQ+ community  = Risk factors and the minority stress model = The minority stress model takes into account significant stressors that distinctly affect the mental health of those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or another non-conforming gender identity. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender- affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. The compounding of these everyday stressors increase poor mental health outcomes among individuals in the LGBTQ+ community. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBTQ+ individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination. In addition, there are a lack of access to mental health resources specific to LGBTQ+ individuals and a lack of awareness about mental health conditions within the LGBTQ+ community that restricts patients from seeking help. = Limited research = There is limited research on mental health in the LGBTQ+ community. Several factors affect the lack of research on mental illness within non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities. Some factors identified: the history of psychiatry with conflating sexual and gender identities with psychiatric symptomatology; medical community's history of labelling gender identities such as homosexuality as an illness (now removed from the DSM); the presence of gender dysphoria in the DSM-V; prejudice and rejection from physicians and healthcare providers; LGBTQ+ underrepresentation in research populations; physicians' reluctance to ask patients about their gender; and the presence of laws against the LGBTQ+ community in many countries. General patterns such as the prevalence of minority stress have been broadly studied. There is also a lack of empirical research on racial and ethnic differences in mental health status among the LGBTQ+ community and the intersection of multiple minority identities. = Stigmatization of LGBTQ+ individuals with severe mental illnesses = There is a significantly greater stigmatization of LGBTQ+ individuals with more severe conditions. The presence of the stigma affects individuals' access to treatment and is particularly present for non-heterosexual and gender non-conforming individuals with schizophrenia. = Anxiety = LGBTQ+ individuals are nearly three times more likely to experience anxiety compared to heterosexual individuals. Gay and bisexual men are more likely to have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as compared to heterosexual men. = Depression = Individuals who identify as non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming are more likely to experience depressive episodes and suicide attempts than those who identity as heterosexual. Based solely on their gender identity and sexual orientation, LGBTQ+ individuals face stigma, societal bias, and rejection that increase the likelihood of depression. Gay and bisexual men are more likely to have major depression and bipolar disorder than heterosexual men. Transgender youth are nearly four times more likely to experience depression, as compared to their non-transgender peers. Compared to LGBTQ+ youth with highly accepting families, LGBTQ+ youth with less accepting families are more than three times likely to consider and attempt suicide. As compared to individuals with a level of certainty in their gender identity and sexuality (such as LGB- identified and heterosexual students), youth who are questioning their sexuality report higher levels of depression and worse psychological responses to bullying and victimization. 31% of LGBTQ+ older adults report depressive symptoms. LGBTQ+ older adults experience LGBTQ+ stigma and ageism that increase their likeliness to experience depression. = Post-traumatic stress disorder = LGBTQ+ individuals experience higher rates of trauma than the general population, the most common of which include intimate partner violence, sexual assault and hate violence. Compared to heterosexual populations, LGBTQ+ individuals are at 1.6 to 3.9 times greater risk of probable PTSD. One-third of PTSD disparities by sexual orientation are due to disparities in child abuse victimization. = Suicide = As compared to heterosexual men, gay and bisexual men are at a greater risk for suicide, attempting suicide, and dying of suicide. In the United States, 29% (almost one-third) of LGB youth have attempted suicide at least once. Compared to heterosexual youth, LGB+ youth are twice as likely to feel suicidal and over four times as likely to attempt suicide. Transgender individuals are at the greatest risk of suicide attempts. One-third of transgender individuals (both in youth and adulthood) has seriously considered suicide and one-fifth of transgender youth has attempted suicide. LGBT+ youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Youth who are questioning their gender identity and/or sexuality are two times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. As compared to white transgender individuals, transgender individuals who are African American/black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native, or Multiracial are at a greater risk of suicide attempts. 39% of LGBTQ+ older adults have considered suicide. = Substance abuse = In the United States, an estimate of 20-30% of LGBTQ+ individuals abuse substances. This is higher than the 9% of the U.S. population that abuse substances. In addition, 25% of LGBTQ+ individuals abuse alcohol compared to the 5-10% of the general population. Lesbian and bisexual youth have a higher percentage of substance use problems as compared to sexual minority males and heterosexual females. However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Lesbian and bisexual women are twice as likely to engage in heavy alcohol drinking as compared to heterosexual women. Gay and bisexual men are less likely to engage in heavy alcohol drinking as compared to heterosexual men. Substance use such as alcohol and drug use among LGBTQ+ individuals can be a coping mechanism in response to everyday stressors like violence, discrimination, and homophobia. Substance use can threaten LGBTQ+ individuals' financial stability, employment, and relationships. = Eating disorders = The average age for developing an eating disorder is 19 years old for LGBTQ+ individuals, compared to 12‚Äì13 years old nationally. In a national survey of LGBTQ youth conducted by the National Eating Disorders Association, The Trevor Project and the Reasons Eating Disorder Center in 2018, 54% of participants indicated that they had been diagnosed with an eating disorder. An additional 21% of surveyed participants suspected that they had an eating disorder. Various risk factors may increase the likelihood of LGBTQ+ individuals experiencing disordered eating, including fear of rejection, internalized negativity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or pressure to conform with body image ideals within the LGBTQ+ community. 42% of men who experience disordered eating identify as gay. Gay men are also seven times more likely to report binge eating and twelve times more likely to report purging than heterosexual men. Gay and bisexual men also experience a higher prevalence of full-syndrome bulimia and all subclinical eating disorders than their heterosexual counterparts. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours. However, lesbian women are more likely to report positive body image compared to heterosexual females (42.1% vs 20.5%). Transgender individuals are significantly more likely than any other LGBTQ+ demographic to report an eating disorder diagnosis or compensatory behaviour related to eating. Transgender individuals may use weight restriction to suppress secondary sex characteristics or to suppress or stress gendered features. There is limited research regarding racial differences within LGBTQ+ populations as it relates to disordered eating. Conflicting studies have struggled to ascertain whether LGBTQ+ people of colour experience similar or varying rates of eating disorder proneness or diagnosis.  Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders  = Violence against women = There are different type of levels of violence that can occur against women. Violence was defined by World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group of community, which either results in has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\" = Intimate partner violence/ domestic violence = Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. Data collected from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18‚Äì65 found that women were significantly more likely than men to experience physical and sexual IPV. According to The National Domestic Violence Hotline, \\"From 1994 to 2010, about 4 in 5 victims of intimate partner violence were female.\\" There have been numerous studies conducted linking the experience of being a survivor of domestic violence to a number of mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, substance dependence, and suicidal attempts. Humphreys and Thiara (2003) assert that the body of existing research evidence shows a direct link between the experience of IPV and higher rates of self-harm, depression, and trauma symptoms. The NVAWS survey found that physical IPV was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, substance dependence problems, and chronic mental illness. A study conducted in 1995 of 171 women reporting a history of domestic violence and 175 reporting no history of domestic violence confirmed these hypotheses. The study found that the women with a history of domestic violence were 11.4 times more likely to suffer dissociation, 4.7 times more likely to suffer anxiety, 3 times as likely to suffer from depression, and 2.3 times more likely to have a substance abuse problem. The same study noted that several of the women interviewed stated that they only began having mental health issues when they began to experience violence in their intimate relationships. In a similar study, 191 women who reported at least one event of IPV in their lifetime were tested for PTSD. 33% of the women tested positively were lifetime PTSD, and 11.4% tested positive for current PTSD. As far as males are concerned, it is estimated that 1 in 9 men experience severe IPV. For men as well, domestic violence is correlated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal behavior.  Causes of intimate partner violence  One can identify several factors that are likely to lead to intimate partner violence: * Intimate partner violence depends on socio-economic status (SES). The higher SES the less likely relationships will have financial difficulties. Financially stability can decrease IPV. Women who are not economically independent are less likely to escape a violent relationship since they might feel dependent and vulnerable. Additionally, lack of resources increases the levels of stress and conflict in the household. * Food-insecurity at the household level is associated with increase experience of IPV. vulnerable without them. Higher SES is associated with IPV. * Domestic violence can also appear as a repetitive scheme. Indeed, men who witnessed their fathers using violence against their wife or children who experienced violence themselves are more likely to perpetrate inmate partner violence in their adult relationship. * Poverty and substance may contribute to a violent behavior, since these substances diminish the control over one's violent impulsions. * Lower levels of education * a history of exposure to child maltreatment (perpetration and experience); * Antisocial personality disorder * Community norms that privilege or ascribe higher status to men and lower status to women; * Low levels of women's access to paid employment.  How (IPV) impacts women's mental health  The United Nations estimates that \\"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\\" Women's well-being are reported to be at risk due to Intimate partner violence. Indeed, evidence shows that women who have been confronted to IPV or sexual violence report higher rates of depression, psychosis, abortion and acquiring HIV, than women who have not. \\"Domestic violence is associated with depression, anxiety, PTSD and substance abuse in the general population. Additionally, women who are at risk can develop suicidal thoughts, depression, PTSD and anxiety.\\" The presence of domestic violence in their life causes psychiatric disorders amongst women survivors of domestic violence. Another study found that in a group of women in a psychiatric inpatient hospital ward, women who were survivors of domestic violence were twice as likely to suffer depression as those were not. All twenty of the women interviewed fit into a pattern of symptoms associated with trauma-based mental health disorders. Six of the women had attempted suicide. Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. The direct psychological effects of IPV may contribute directly to the development of these disorders. In Humphreys' and Thiara's study, 60% of the women interviewed feared for their life, 69% feared for their emotional wellbeing, and 60% feared for their mental health. Some of the women discussed an undermining of their self-esteem, as well as an \\"overwhelming fear and erosion of their sense of safety.\\" Johnson and Ferraro (2000) refer to this overwhelming fear as \\"intimate terrorism,\\" decimating a women's sense of security and contributing to a worsening psychological state. Humphreys and Thiara (2003) refer to these consequential mental disorders as \\"symptoms of abuse\\". That sentiment is echoed by some survivors who don't feel comfortable identifying with loaded diagnoses such as depression or PTSD. = Sexual violence = The National Coalition against Domestic Violence provides useful guidelines to distinguish between sexual violence and domestic violence. Sexual violence describes a sexually abusive behavior by a partner or non- partner that can result in rape and sexual assault. Sometimes, in abusive relationships, sexual and domestic violence can intersect. \\"Between 14% and 25% of women are sexually assaulted by intimate partners during their relationship.\\" Global estimates published by the World Health Organization indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. Sexual violence increasingly impact adolescent girls who are subjected to forced sex, rape and sexual assault. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life.  How sexual violence impacts women's mental health  Sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse are likely to impact a women's mental health on a short and long-term basis. Many survivors are \\"mentally marked by this trauma and report flashbacks of their assault, and feelings of shame, isolation, shock, confusion, and guilt.\\" Additionally, victims of rape or sexual assault are at a higher risk for developing depression, PTSD, Substance Use Disorders, Eating Disorders, Anxiety. As an example, data suggests that 30 to 80 percent of sexual assault survivors develop PTSD. = Social Media Pressures and Criticism = Social media is highly prevalent and influential among the current generation of adolescents and young adults. Approximately 90% of young adults in the United States have and use a social media platform on a regular basis. Social media has a substantial influence on how young adults perceive their physicality due to its appearance-focused nature. When individuals self-objectify by comparing themselves to others on social media, it can lead to increased body shame and body surveillance. In turn, these behaviors can results in an increased risk for disordered eating. The effect of social media use on self-objectification is greater in female users. Women receive greater amounts of pressure and criticism surrounding their physical appearance, making them more likely to internalize the body ideals that are glorified on social media. Consequently, women face a higher risk of developing in body dissatisfaction or unhealthy eating behaviors.  Gender bias in medicine  A gender bias exists in the very treatment of mental disorders. According to a study by the World Health Organization, \\"doctors are more likely to diagnose depression in women compared with men, even when they have similar scores on standardized measures of depression or present with identical symptoms\\". Accordingly, gender stereotypes regarding the over- exposure of women to emotional problems and the higher risk of alcoholism among men, reinforce social stigma. Men and women willingly or unwillingly internalize these stereotypes. This internalization is then a barrier to accurate diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. This phenomenon leads to a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy and traduces in patterns of help seeking for both men and women. Indeed, women are more likely to disclose mental health disorders to their physician while men are more likely to disclose problems with alcohol use. Female patient with sleep hysteria The diagnosis of hysteria is a bright example of a medical diagnosis that was once almost exclusively applied to women. For hundred of years in Western Europe, hysteria was seen as an excess of emotion and a lack of self-control, that would mostly impact women. The diagnosis was used as a form of social labeling to discourage women from venturing outside of their role, that is a tool to take control over the increasing emancipation of women. Implicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Due to internalized societal and medical bias, physicians are more likely to diagnosed LGBTQ+ patients with anxiety, depression and suicidality.  Socioeconomic status (SES)  Socioeconomic Status is a global term which refers to a person's income level, education and position in society. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \\"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\\" = Gender disparities in socioeconomic status (SES) = SES is a key factor in determining one's opportunities and quality of life. Inequities in wealth and quality of life for women are known to exist both locally and globally. According to a 2015 survey of the U.S Census Bureau, in the United States, women's poverty rates are higher than men's. Indeed, \\"more than 1 in 7 women (nearly 18.4 million) lived in poverty in 2014.\\" US Gender Pay Gap by state in 2006 When it comes to income and earning ability in the United States, women are once again at an economic disadvantage. Indeed, for a same level of education and an equivalent field of occupation, men earn a higher wage than women. Though the pay-gap has narrowed over time, according U.S Census Bureau Survey, it was still 21% in 2014. Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \\"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\\". = The impact of gender disparities in SES on women's mental health = Increasing evidence tend to show a positive correlation between lower SES and negative mental health outcomes for women. Firstly, \\"Pregnant women with low SES report significantly more depressive symptoms, which suggests that the third trimester may be more stressful for low-income women (Goyal et al., 2010).\\" Accordingly, postpartum depression has proven to be more prevalent among lower-income mothers. (Goyal et al., 2010). Secondly, women are often the primary care-taker for their families. As a result, women with insecure job and housing experience higher stress and anxiety since their precarious economic situation places them and their children at higher risk of poverty and violent victimization (World Health Organization, 2013). Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \\"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences Research have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. = Post-traumatic stress disorder = Biological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been proposed for both men and women. The HPA helps to regulate an individual's stress response by changing the amount of stress hormones released into the body, such as cortisol. However, a meta-analysis found that women have greater dysregulation than men; women have been found to have lower circulating cortisol concentrations compared to healthy controls, where men did not have this difference in cortisol. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Women are reported to be more likely to appraise events as stressful and to report higher perceived distress in response to traumatic events compared to men, potentially leading to an increased dysregulation of the HPA in women than in men. Recent research demonstrates a potential link between female hormones and the acquisition and extinction of fear responses. Studies suggest that higher levels of progesterone in women are associated with increased glucocorticoid availability, which may enhance consolidation and recall of distressful visual memories and intrusive thoughts. One important challenge for future researchers is navigating fluctuations hormones throughout the menstrual cycle to further isolate the unique effects of estradiol and progesterone on PTSD. = Depression = Expanding on the research concerning the HPA and PTSD, one existing hypothesis is that women are more likely than men to have a dysregulated HPA in response to a traumatic event, like in PTSD. This dysregulation may occur as a result of the increased likelihood of women experiencing a traumatic event, as traumatic events have been known to contribute to HPA dysregulation. Differences in stress hormone levels can influence moods due to the negative effect of high cortisol concentrations on biochemicals that regular mood such as serotonin. Research has found that people with MDD have elevated cortisol levels in response to stress and that low serotonin levels are related to the development of depression. Thus, it is possible that a dysregulation in the HPA, when combined with the increased history of traumatic events, may contribute to the gender differences seen in depression. Coping mechanisms in PTSD For PTSD, genders differences in coping mechanisms has been proposed as a potential explanation for observed gender differences in PTSD prevalence rates. Tough PTSD is a common diagnosis associated with abuse and trauma for men and women, the \\"most common mental health problem for women who are trauma survivors is depression\\". Studies have found that women tend to respond differently to stressful situations than men. For example, men are more likely than women to react using the fight-or-flight response. Additionally, men are more likely to use problem-focused coping, which is known to decrease the risk of developing PTSD when a stressor is perceived to be within an individual's control. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. These coping strategies have been found in research to correlate with an increased likelihood of developing PTSD. Women are more likely to blame themselves following a traumatic event than men, which has been found to increase an individual's risk of PTSD. In addition, women have been found to be more sensitive to a loss of social support following a traumatic event than men. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. These described differences in coping mechanisms are in line with a preliminary model of sex- specific pathways to PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. In this model, variables such as dissociation, social support, and use of emotion-focused coping may be involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD in women, whereas physiological arousal, anxiety, avoidant coping, and use of problem-focused coping may be more likely to be related to the development and maintenance of PTSD in men. However, this model is only preliminary and further research is needed. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page.  Coping mechanism among the LGBTQ+ community  Each individual has its own way to deal with difficult emotions and situations. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These coping mechanisms tend to be developed during youth and early-adult life. Once a risky coping mechanism is adopted, it is often hard for the individual to get rid of it. Safe coping-mechanisms, when it comes to mental disorders, involve communication with others, body and mental health caring, support and help seeking. Because of the high stigmatization they often experience in school, public spaces and society in general, the LGBTQ+ community, and more especially the young people among them are less likely to express themselves and seek for help and support, because of the lack of resources and safe spaces available for them to do so. As a result, LGBTQ+ patients are more likely to adopt risky coping mechanisms then the rest of the population. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \\"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

It is a part of the municipality of Ommen, and lies about 16 km south of Hoogeveen. The statistical area \\"Ommerschans\\", which also can include the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 290.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Statline: Kerncijfers wijken en buurten 2003‚Äì2005. As of 1 January 2005. History The OmmerschansVereniging De Ommerschans, History of the Ommerschans (in Dutch) . was a fortress built in 1628 as part of a defence line to defend the northern provinces of Groningen and Friesland from the marauding count Hendrik van den Bergh (in Spanish service) after the expiration of the Twelve Years' Truce. Its defences were strengthened again in the middle of the 17th century to defend against a possible invasion from the east. Nonetheless the fortress was captured without any resistance when the Catholic bishops Bernhard von Galen of M√ºnster and Maximilian Henry of Cologne invaded in 1672, the so-called rampjaar (or disaster year) that started the Franco-Dutch War. The 146 musketeers and 55 pikemen stationed at Ommerschans fled north, only to return later that year when the bishops retreated after their failed siege of the northern city of Groningen. Under pressure from the citizens of Ommen and after the Peace of Utrecht of 1713, the fortress was closed down in 1715, only to be reinstated as a fortified arsenal in 1740 when war reignited in Continental Europe. During the Patriot Revolt of 1787, militias from Zwolle, Kampen and Vollenhove conquered and pillaged Ommerschans, stealing all its weaponry to help them in their paramilitary struggle against the regime. The fortification became abandoned and would never again be used for military purposes. In the early 19th century, the Dutch government changed it into a resocialisation institution and labour camp for beggars, prostitutes and alcoholics from Amsterdam and other western cities. They were supposed to learn farming and morals by experience so they could reintegrate into society. In reality the beggars were used for semi- forced and all-but-unpaid labour to reclaim the wetlands surrounding Ommerschans, eventually reclaiming an area of 4 by 2¬Ω kilometres. Politician and novelist Jacob van Lennep visited Ommerschans during his walking tour with Dirk van Hogendorp the younger across the newly independent United Kingdom of the Netherlands in the summer of 1823, and documented his appal at the conditions at the labour camp: \\"These hours are certainly among the saddest I have lived through.\\" When the institution went bankrupt in 1859 the Dutch government managed the labour camp until 1889, when it was finally closed down. During its years in operation, between several hundred and two thousand workers would live at Ommerschans at any one time, and an estimated 5448 workers died whilst at Ommerschans. After its closure, the lands around Ommerschans became part of the state penitential institution Fpc Veldzicht, a few kilometers north at the village of Balkbrug. The grounds are still being cultivated by means of enforced labour.

Prince Albert I had only one legitimate child, the Hereditary Prince Louis, then heir apparent to the principality. As World War I drew to a close, Prince Louis, at the age of forty-eight, remained (legally) childless, unmarried, and unbetrothed. Dynastic dilemma Louis' nearest legitimate next of kin was Prince Albert I's first cousin Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach (1864‚Äì1928). He was born in Monaco in 1864, and was largely raised there as a Francophone Roman Catholic by his mother after her widowhood in 1869. He was educated at the former Jesuit School until 1882.Journal de Monaco No. 3,665; 29 March 1928. He was, however, a Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg national, and his adult domicile and main assets (including Lichtenstein Castle) were in W√ºrttemberg. Although he was awarded the Grand Cross of Monaco's Order of Saint-Charles and was a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, he also was awarded much later the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of W√ºrttemberg and was a knight of Kaiser Wilhelm II's Order of the Black Eagle. In 1871 W√ºrttemberg became a part of the German Empire, Wilhelm joined the W√ºrttemberg army in 1882, and by 1911 this coloured the status of his claim to Monaco. His father Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach, had many connections to France before his marriage in 1863 to Princess Florestine. His first wife Th√©odolinde de Beauharnais was a grand-daughter of Empress Jos√©phine, Napol√©on‚Äôs first wife. His cousin Catharina had married J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, and their son Prince Napol√©on Bonaparte was a senior adviser in the Second French Empire at the time of Princess Florestine‚Äôs marriage. Another cousin, Alexander, had married a daughter of Louis Philippe I in 1837. In turn, Wilhelm the 2nd Duke‚Äôs wife Duchess Amalie was descended through her mother from Louis XV. So there was no cultural or dynastic aspect in the von Urachs‚Äô past that was anti-French, rather the opposite; but this meant nothing in the climate of Revanche between the French Third Republic and the new Imperial Germany. The 2nd Duke, a descendant through a morganatic marriage of the royal family of W√ºrttemberg, was the elder son of Albert's aunt, Princess Florestine of Monaco. Although he was ineligible to inherit the crown of his patrilineal ancestors in Germany, given the line of succession to the Monegasque throne at that time, there was every likelihood that the principality would pass by lawful inheritance into Wilhelm's \\"German hands\\" upon the death of Prince Louis. However, given the bitter relations between France and Germany at that time ‚Äì a socio-political legacy of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 and then of World War I ‚Äì France deemed it unacceptable for a country over which it had exercised de facto or de jure hegemony, intermittently since the 17th century and consistently for half a century, to fall into the hands of a German aristocrat. Moreover, while the House of Grimaldi had close ties to France due not only to geographical proximity, but also to possession of estates (vaster by far than the territory of the principality) and financial investments there, nothing officially prevented the dynasty's political or cultural associations from focusing elsewhere. Moreover, the hereditary principle allocated monarchies according to one form or another of proximity of blood, and the Grimaldis' hitherto exclusive control of Monaco's dynastic marital policy was what threatened to enthrone a German duke on France's border, even after the Empire's defeat in war. Just as the ruling families of Britain, Russia, Belgium, and the Netherlands had all become patrilineally German by the twentieth century due to the propensity of monarchical heiresses, seeking dynastically equal marriages, to choose husbands from among Germany's many minor princely families, Monaco was on the verge of the same fate.Reviving that tradition among European royalty, in 1999 the heiress presumptive of Monaco, Caroline Grimaldi, married a German-born prince, HRH Ernst August, Prince of Hanover, and they have issue. Although the Grimaldis did not require inter-marriage with royalty by law as German dynasties typically did, by custom they never married subjects of their own realm, and no Mon√©gasque reigning prince or heir had wed a French consort in more than a century. By 1910 France also worried that Monaco might become a future U-boat base only 150 km from the important French naval base at Toulon. Louis had served in the French army for most of his life, and was a Brigadier General by 1918. In contrast, Wilhelm had joined the XIII (Royal W√ºrttemberg) Corps in 1890, and had commanded the German 26th Division in 1914‚Äì17. The \\"crisis\\" therefore hinged upon Monaco's legitimate order of succession on the one hand, and France's security policy on the other. Constitution of Monaco, 1911 In 1910-11 the peaceful Monegasque Revolution protests resulted in the Constitution of Monaco.The New York Times, March 13, 1910. This led to the end of absolutism, at least on paper, and also as a part of the overall resolution the Duke of Urach's claim was relegated behind that of Albert's newly recognised granddaughter Charlotte Louvet (see below). No sovereign: no sovereignty The solution was an unequal treaty between France and Monaco which formalized and rendered permanent the latter's position as a client state: Not only did it require Monaco to conduct its foreign relations in consultation with or through France, but it obliged the dynasty to obtain French authorization for marital alliances or changes in succession, and declared that should the throne become vacant Monaco would become an official protectorate under French jurisdiction ‚Äì while retaining nominal independence. Birth and recognition of Charlotte Louis, while serving in the French army, befriended the laundress of his regiment, who asked him to look after her daughter, Marie Juliette Louvet. Subsequently, Louis and Marie had a daughter out-of-wedlock, Charlotte Louvet, who remained in the custody of her mother during her minority. Nonetheless, Louis recognised her as his child in 1900. A Mon√©gasque ordinance of 15 May 1911 acknowledged the child as Louis' daughter, and admitted her into the Grimaldi dynasty. However this was discovered to be in procedural violation of the statutes of 1882. The ordinance was therefore invalid, and the sovereign prince was so notified by the National Council of Monaco in 1918. As a consequence, an amendment of 30 October 1918 modified the law to allow the reigning prince or, with the monarch's consent, the Hereditary Prince of Monaco (the heir apparent or heir presumptive, whether a child of the reigning prince or not), to adopt a child, from within or without the princely dynasty, in the absence of legitimate issue of his own. The law stipulated that the adopted child would fully inherit all the rights, titles and prerogatives of the person who adopted him, including succession rights to the crown. The amendment also provided that, should the prince have legitimate issue after such an adoption, the adopted child would follow such issue in the order of succession. Another ordinance of 31 October 1918 stated the conditions for an adoption. French Treaty of 1918 While the adoption process was underway, and given the failures of the German Spring Offensive and the Second Battle of the Marne, France persuaded Prince Albert to sign a restrictive treaty in Paris on 17 July 1918. Article 2 stipulated that the accession of future princes of Monaco was to be subject to French approval, thereby limiting Monaco's sovereignty: \\"Measures concerning the international relations of the Principality shall always be the subject of prior consultations between the Government of the Principality and the French Government. The same shall apply to measures concerning directly or indirectly the exercise of a regency or succession to the throne, which shall, whether by marriage or adoption or otherwise, pass only to a person who is of French or Mon√©gasque nationality and is approved by the French Government.\\"Text of the 1918 Treaty Charlotte's adoption and status as heir presumptive Charlotte was formally adopted by her own father Louis at the Mon√©gasque embassy in Paris on 16 May 1919, in the presence of her grandfather Albert I, the French president Poincar√©, and the mayor of Monaco. There is a doubt on the legality of the adoption. The Mon√©gasque civil code (articles 240 and 243) required that the adopting party be of at least age fifty and the adoptee of at least age twenty-one. The 1918 ordinance changed the adoptee's minimum age to eighteen (Charlotte was twenty at the time of adoption) but not the other age limit, Prince Louis then being only aged forty-eight. Charlotte was created Duchess of Valentinois by Albert I on 20 May 1919, and on 1 August 1922, following Louis II's accession on 26 June of that year, she was officially designated the Hereditary Princess of Monaco as her father's heir presumptive. In 1920 she married comte Pierre de Polignac, who belonged to a junior branch of a prominent French ducal family. Prior to the wedding, a Mon√©gasque ordinance of 18 March 1920 had changed Pierre's name and coat of arms to those of Grimaldi. On 20 March, he was allowed to take the title of Duke of Valentinois (his French prefix of comte was, in fact, a courtesy title). Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois and Pierre Grimaldi had a daughter, Princess Antoinette, baroness de Massy, and then a son, Rainier, marquis des Baux. Duke Wilhelm von Urach, along with the other adult descendants of Princess Florestine, discussed renouncing their dynastic rights in 1924 in favour of a French cousin, L√©onor Guigues de Moreton, comte de Chabrillan, who was descended from Prince Joseph of Monaco. The count was a more remote, female- line descendant of the Grimaldi dynasty, and was next in line to the Mon√©gasque throne after the Urachs according to the pre-1920 order of succession. However, this renunciation was never formalised. Thus, the duke considered withdrawing as a claimant to Monaco's throne (he had also been considered for the thrones of Lithuania and Alsace-Lorraine, although these monarchical opportunities never materialized), he did not choose to recognize Monaco's selected heir ‚Äì perhaps unsurprisingly, since the 1918 law and treaty directly intruded upon his hereditary rights, excluding him from a throne for no personal act of dereliction on his part, and without compensation (cf. Prince Ingolf of Denmark). Despite the changed political reality, on the deaths of Wilhelm in 1928 and of his brother Karl in 1925 the official Journal de Monaco expressed grief at their passing, and detailed their funerals in Germany and the memorial services held for them in Monaco. In each case Prince Louis sent senior officials to represent him at his uncles' funerals in Stuttgart.Journal de Monaco, No. 3545, 17 December 1925; Journal de Monaco, No. 3665, 29 March 1928. Renewal of claim in 1930 In 1930 the Chicago Daily Tribune reported that Wilhelm's third son Price Albrecht had met with French officials in Paris, hoping to be approved by them as Louis' heir. 'He believes that the scandal surrounding Princess Charlotte's divorce \\"will help him win his case.\\" He is now in Paris in \\"an attempt to make good his claim\\". .. The Urach branch of the family assert \\"that according to the Monaco constitution such an adoption becomes illegal until all members of the family approve it.\\" The Urachs, a \\"German branch of the family,\\" said they were never asked for their approval and \\"never approved of the adoption\\".' Chicago Daily Tribune, 29 March 1930 Prince Albrecht could argue that his mother was descended from Louise √âlisabeth of France, and so considering the Treaty of 1918 he was more French than his father, and had been educated in Paris. Evidently his claim was rebuffed. Renunciation by Charlotte By a declaration of 30 May 1944 in Paris, Charlotte ceded her rights to the throne to her only son (with a reservation if he should pre-decease), and Rainier accepted in Paris on 1 June. An ordinance of 2 June 1944 acknowledged and confirmed the Sovereign Prince's assent to those declarations, and Rainier was made Hereditary Prince. When the Journal de Monaco published the ordinance on 22 June 1944, it added: \\"His Excellency the comte de Maleville, minister of Monaco in France, has been asked to inform the French government of this event, pursuant to the clauses of the treaty of 17 July 1918.\\" The French government at the time was still the Vichy regime. Louis II died on 9 May 1949. The Principality of Monaco passed to his grandson, Rainier III. In the absence of an heir male, the ducal titles of Valentinois and Estouteville became extinct in French nobiliary law. Before Rainier III married Grace Kelly in April 1956, he notified the French government of his plans; the French ministry of foreign affairs replied with a message of official congratulations. 21st Century Legal Challenge Count Louis de Causans is suing the French government for US$401 million alleging that France used a \\"sleight of hand\\" to deprive Duke Wilhelm II, his ancestor, of the Monegascan throne when it passed the 1911 law permitting Charlotte to be considered a Grimaldi.Aristocrat sues France for $401M for tricking him out of throne Retrieved 14 August 2018 \\"A German reign over Monaco, on the eve of the First World War was simply unacceptable for France\\" said the count‚Äôs lawyer, Jean- Marc Descoub√®s, missing the point that this was never likely; Prince Louis' legitimacy was not questioned by the von Urachs and lasted until 1949.

The EKP was formed November 5, 1920, when the Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was separated from its mother party. During the first half of the 1920s hopes for an immediate world revolution were still high, and Estonian communists had their own hopes of restoring their power. Widespread economic and social crisis supported their hopes. Activists of the party had not only to support the agenda, but also to be ready to participate in the illegal actions, such as organising conspirative apartments, transporting weapons and communist propaganda materials, hide undercover activists and collect information for the revolutionaries. It resulted in a standing conflict situation with the governments. As oriented not to the legal goals EKP never tried to legalise itself in the Estonian Republic, as well as didn't abandon demands for the armed uprising and joining Estonia to the USSR. Although EKP had dropped much below from their popularity of 1917, it still had remarkable support mostly amongst the industrial proletariat, but occasionally also amongst the landless peasants, unemployed, teachers and students. Especially in the 1920s it had strong positions in the trade union movement. In the parliamentary elections EKP front organisations took always more than 5% of the vote. However, following the failed coup attempt by the Estonian communists on December 1, 1924, the party lost this support and membership fell to around 70 to 200 people and remained low until 1940. According to the ECP's own records, there were only 150 party members at the time of the Soviet occupation in July 1940. History Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the Governorate of Estonia had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, Kiir, in Narva. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estonia, named the Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)\\" (). After the February Revolution, as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet. By the end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and four of six seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficulty building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although having introduced Estonian as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, Estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation. Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia. After the German revolution in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed attack against the new state. However, by this time the support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An Estonian Workers' Commune was set up, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the RCP(b) (). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the November 5, 1920 the Communist Party of Estonia (EKP) was founded as a separate party. In the rigged 1940 Riigivolikogu election, the Communist Party ran within the Estonian Working People's Union bloc. =Merger with the CPSU= In 1940 EKP was merged into the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks). The territorial organization of the AUCP(b) in the Estonian SSR became known as Communist Party of Estonia (bolsheviks) (EK(b)P). The EK(b)P was purged in 1950 of many of its original native leaders they were replaced by a number of prominent Estonians who had grown up in Russia,\\"The Baltic States, years of dependence, 1940-1990\\", by Romuald J. Misiunas, Rein Taagepera, 1993, , p. 149 see \\"Yestonians\\". When the AUCP(b) changed its name in 1952 to CPSU, the EK(b)P removed the (b) from its name. =Split of 1990= EKP was divided in 1990, as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the Estonian Democratic Labour Party.

Being an island fort, it is also called Jaldurg or Janjire-Arnala. The Portuguese, who built the present fort, called the island Ilha das vacas.  History  In 1516 a local chieftain in Gujarat, Sultan Mahmud Begda, constructed the fort on the island, strategically located at the mouth of the Vaitarna river. In the 1530s the Portuguese had established their operations in the coastal area, headquartered at Fort Bassein, and soon gained control of the island. The Portuguese captain of Bassein donated the island to a Portuguese nobleman who tore down the old fort and began construction of a fort. The nobleman never completed the fort. Still, it remained under Portuguese control for two centuries; they used it to control shipping and navigation along the northern Konkan coast. During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, after a long struggle with the Mughal Empire, the Maratha Confederacy came to dominate present day Maharashtra. In 1737 the then Peshwa Baji Rao I sent his brother, Chimaji Appa, to take the Bassein Fort from the Portuguese. After winning the Battle of Vasai, his general, Shankarji Pant, persuaded Chimaji to launch an assault on Fort Arnala, for its strategic importance to the Maratha navy in assaulting Portuguese interests. Their first assault, coordinated with a Maratha naval force commanded by Manaji Agre, was routed by a superior Portuguese naval force. A second assault on the fort on 28 March 1737, caught the Portuguese by surprise and forced them to abandon the fort. The victory was commemorated by a plaque installed on the northern wall of the fort and is still visible today. The Marathas then rebuilt the fort, constructing three bastions Bahirav, Bhavani, and Bava. The British captured the fort on 18 January 1781 during the First Anglo-Maratha War. The Marathas controlled the fort until 1817. During the third British-Maratha war, despite successfully defending the fort, the Marathas were forced to surrender the fort to the British due to their superior naval power. The treaty of Salabai returned the Arnala and Bassien forts to the Marathas, but the British regained the forts under the Treaty of Poona. Today the fort is in a state of disrepair.  Features  Octagonal water reservoir inside the fort. = Octagonal Water Reservoir and Temples = There is a large octagonal fresh water reservoir inside the fort. Inside the fort are the temples of Ambakeshwar, the goddess Bhavani, Lord Shiva, and the tombs of Shahali and Hajjali. The 'paduka' or sacred sandals of Shrinityanand Maharaj are housed in a dome on the eastern face of the fort. = The Entrance = The main entrance of the fort faces approximately north. Main entrance as seen from North side. The solid stone doorway is adorned with pictures of tigers and elephants. Detail of images of Tiger and elephant on the entrance door. = Ramparts and Walls = The external ramparts are in a fairly good condition, and a roughly three-meter-wide path exists along the outer walls. . =Southern Watch Tower= There exists a lone Martello tower about 550 meters from the main fort, on the southern end of the island.

Biography  Peter Donohoe was born in Manchester, England and educated at Chetham's School of Music where he studied violin, viola, clarinet and tuba. Donald Clarke recommended that Donohoe do an audition at the age of 14 at the Royal Manchester College of Music, as a result, professor Derek Wyndham insisted on taking him as his youngest student. Donohoe continued to work with Wyndham throughout the rest of his schooldays, and then went on to study music with Alexander Goehr at the University of Leeds. Later he returned to Manchester to continue working at the Royal Northern College of Music with Professor Wyndham, graduating in 1976 as BMus with first class honours in both piano and percussion as both teacher and performer. In 1975 he had been engaged for a trial as timpanist with the BBC Philharmonic, which was the high point in a career in percussion playing that included the formation of a rock group, a percussion ensemble and involvement in many opera and symphonic performances across the UK as both first-call free-lance percussionist and regular extra with many major British symphony orchestras. Later this led to becoming first call extra keyboard player with the BBC Philharmonic, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the Hall√©. During his student years he also studied percussion playing with Jack Gledhill - then timpanist with the Hall√© - and Gilbert Webster, who had been Principal Percussionist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, who encouraged his exploration of other disciplines, including the cimbalom, jazz improvisation on the vibraphone, and rock drumming. However, during his final year as an undergraduate he decided to put all his energies into the piano. After graduating, he spent one year studying with Yvonne Loriod and Olivier Messiaen in Paris. During his student years at the Royal Northern College of Music he had also studied with Vlado Perlemuter, Sir William Glock, Roger Woodward, Charles Rosen and Sequeira Costa. In 1974 and 1975 he attended the Bart√≥k Seminar in Budapest, where he studied with P√°l Kadosa and first met his long- term colleague, Zolt√°n Kocsis. In 1976 Donohoe entered his first two competitions. The first was the British Liszt Competition in Guildford, England, in which he took third prize. Secondly he entered the Bart√≥k-Liszt Competition in Budapest, Hungary, winning the Special Prize for his performance of Bart√≥k. It was in 1981 that he decided to extend his activities into foreign countries, and entered the Leeds International Piano Competition, in which he was placed sixth. One year later, in July 1982, he won the Joint Silver Medal at the International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow ‚Äì then in the Soviet Union. From his success with the Soviet public and musical colleagues he developed a relationship with Russia that is ongoing. In the early years of his solo piano career, Donohoe was in demand by many UK recital series and amateur orchestras. Youth orchestras also played a big part in his activities. In 1970 he had joined the Cheshire Youth Orchestra as a percussionist, eventually becoming its percussion tutor, and also housemaster for several courses. On the first course in 1970 he had also played Prokofiev's First Piano Concerto, as well as being the orchestra's timpanist for the rest of the program. His first significant break with professional orchestras was a result of his regular work as keyboard player with the Hall√©, including many performances of the piano part of Stravinsky's Petrushka. The conductor James Loughran offered him an opportunity to give his first solo concerto performance with a professional orchestra in June 1976, the same month in which he graduated from the Royal Northern College of Music and two months before the British Lizst Competition and the Bart√≥k-Liszt Competition. His performance of Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini launched a long-standing relationship with the Hall√©, as well as leading to many invitations to perform as soloist with many other British orchestras. He made his London debut at the Purcell Room in 1979, closely followed by his Last Night of the Proms debut in the same year. In 1974 he met the conductor Simon Rattle ‚Äì then 19 years old and having won the John Player International Conductors' Competition that same week. It was Rattle's first performance of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring ‚Äì a piece with which he is known to have a special affinity ‚Äì and Peter Donohoe was the timpanist. This encounter was to develop across the next 25 years, going on to include several foreign orchestral tours, over 50 concerto performances in cities all over the world and many CD piano concerto recordings. The link with the CBSO and Rattle (Rattle was the CBSO's Principal Conductor 1980‚Äì1998) brought about his performance in 2002 at Rattle's inaugural concert as chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Donohoe was appointed Principal Conductor and Artistic Director of the Northern Chamber Orchestra in 1984, a post he relinquished in 1987. He founded the Orchestra of the Mill in 1987 and directed it until 1993 when the orchestra ceased to exist owing to local council funding being withdrawn as a result of rate-capping. In 2000 he was appointed Principal Guest Conductor of the Bath Philharmonia. Donohoe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours. Since appearing on the professional stage, he has performed all over the world in solo recitals and chamber music, and in particular as solo artist with many of the world's leading symphony orchestras. These have included professional symphony orchestras in the UK and Ireland, including annual performances at the Proms for seventeen years. Abroad he has played as soloist with a number of major orchestras and conductors.  Recordings  Donohoe exclusively signed with EMI Records in 1988, beginning a relationship that lasted until 1993, producing a major collection of CDs. These recordings tend largely towards 20th century composers such as Olivier Messiaen, B√©la Bart√≥k, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Alban Berg, George Gershwin, Benjamin Britten and Sergei Rachmaninoff. He preferred to wait until later in life before recording music by romantic and particularly classical composers, making exceptions, however, for music by Franz Liszt, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Johannes Brahms and Ludwig van Beethoven. His recording of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 2 won the Gramophone Magazine Concerto Recording of the year in 1988, and his recording of Liszt's Sonata in B minor won the Grand Prix du Disque in 1993. Since then he has made many recordings on a freelance basis with Deutsche Grammophon, Hyperion, Chandos, BMG, Warner and Naxos. In the latter case, a series of recordings devoted to British works for piano and orchestra was inaugurated in 2001, growing to a catalogue of 14 works.

Lewis of Fordham University. It is a computer algebra system, in which items being computed can be integers (of arbitrary size), rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, modular numbers, finite field elements, multivariable polynomials, rational functions, or polynomials modulo other polynomials. The main areas of application are multivariate rational function arithmetic and matrix algebra over rings of multivariate polynomials or rational functions. Fermat does not do simplification of transcendental functions or symbolic integration. A session with Fermat usually starts by choosing rational or modular \\"mode\\" to establish the ground field (or ground ring) F as \\\\mathbb{Z} or \\\\mathbb{Z}/n. On top of this may be attached any number of symbolic variables t_1, t_2, \\\\dots, t_n, thereby creating the polynomial ring F[t_1, t_2, \\\\dots, t_n] and its quotient field. Further, some polynomials p, q, \\\\dots involving some of the t_i can be chosen to mod out with, creating the quotient ring F(t_1, t_2, \\\\dots)/(p, q, \\\\dots). Finally, it is possible to allow Laurent polynomials, those with negative as well as positive exponents. Once the computational ring is established in this way, all computations are of elements of this ring. The computational ring can be changed later in the session. The polynomial gcd procedures, which call each other in a highly recursive manner, are about 7000 lines of code. Fermat has extensive built-in primitives for array and matrix manipulations, such as submatrix, sparse matrix, determinant, normalize, column reduce, row echelon, Smith normal form, and matrix inverse. It is consistently faster than some well known computer algebra systems, especially in multivariate polynomial gcd. It is also space efficient. The basic data item in Fermat is a multivariate rational function or quolynomial. The numerator and denominator are polynomials with no common factor. Polynomials are implemented recursively as general linked lists, unlike some systems that implement polynomials as lists of monomials. To implement (most) finite fields, the user finds an irreducible monic polynomial in a symbolic variable, say p(t_1), and commands Fermat to mod out by it. This may be continued recursively, q(t_2, t_1), etc. Low level data structures are set up to facilitate arithmetic and gcd over this newly created ground field. Two special fields, GF(2^{8}) and GF(2^{16}), are more efficiently implemented at the bit level. History Fermat was last updated on 20 May 2020 (Mac and Linux; latest Windows version: 1 November 2011). In an earlier version, called FFermat (Float Fermat), the basic number type is floating point numbers of 18 digits. That version allows for numerical computing techniques, has extensive graphics capabilities, no sophisticated polynomial gcd algorithms, and is available only for Mac OS 9. Fermat was originally written in Pascal for a DEC VAX, then for the classic Mac OS during 1985‚Äì1996. It was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1998. In 2003 it was translated into C and ported to Linux (Intel machines) and Unix (Sparc/Sun). It is about 98,000 lines of C code. The FFermat and (old) Windows Fermat Pascal source code have been made available to the public under a restrictive license. The manual was extensively revised and updated on 25 July 2011 (latest small revision in June 2016, apparently another revision on 25 March 2020).

He was the Locomotive Superintendent of the North London Railway from 1858 to 1873; the Great Eastern Railway from 1873 until 1878 and the London and South Western Railway from then until his retirement in 1895. He is best known for his locomotives featuring the Adams bogie, a device with lateral centring springs (initially made of rubber) to improve high-speed stability. He should not be mistaken for William Bridges Adams (1797‚Äì1872) a locomotive engineer who, confusingly, invented the Adams axle ‚Äì a radial axle that William Adams incorporated in designs for the London and South Western Railway. History Adams was born on 15 October 1823 in Mill Place, Limehouse, London, where his father was resident engineer of the nearby East and West India Docks Company. After private schooling in Margate, Kent he was apprenticed to his father's works. The railway surveyor Charles Vignoles had previously worked on the construction of the London dock basins and this association then secured a position for Adams as an assistant in his drawing office. The final years of apprenticeship were spent at the Orchard Wharf works of Miller & Ravenhill, builders of engines for steamships. In 1848 Adams became assistant works manager for Philip Taylor, an ironfounder, millwright and former assistant to Marc Brunel, who had set up workshops in Marseilles and Genoa to build and install marine engines. Fluent in French and Italian, Adams soon found himself effectively the superintendent engineer for the Royal Sardinian Navy, although still nominally working for Taylor. (The Kingdom of Sardinia then encompassed Genoa and much of what is now north-west Italy.) In 1852 he married Isabella Park, the daughter of another English millwright working in Genoa, and returned to England. On his return to England Adams initially worked as a surveyor: considering possible routes for a railway on the Isle of Wight, overseeing construction work at Cardiff Docks and planning and equipping new workshops at Bow for the East & West India Docks & Birmingham Junction Railway, soon to change its name to the North London Railway. This led to his appointment as the company's locomotive engineer in 1854, a post he held for eighteen years. Here he introduced his noted series of 4-4-0 tank engines, the first to use the laterally-sprung bogie, and the first continuous train brake. In 1873 Adams took up a similar position with the nearby Great Eastern Railway (GER). There he did not well appreciate the different requirements of the line, a far-flung concern compared with the North London, and his locomotive designs for the company were found to be underpowered for main-line work. However his refitting of the company's Stratford works using modern, standardised equipment saved a great deal of money and, when he left for the London and South Western Railway in 1878, his reputation was intact. Adams produced five locomotive designs for the GER, including two sizes of suburban passenger tank engine, an express passenger class, and a design for heavy coal traffic. This last, the 527 class, was the first 2-6-0 to be built for service in Britain, although they did not enter service until his successor Massey Bromley had taken office and incorporated some modifications to the design. On the LSWR he designed 524 locomotives, supervised the expansion of Nine Elms Works and the transfer of the Carriage and Wagon Works to Eastleigh. Failing health forced his retirement on 29 May 1895 whilst living in Carlton House on Putney Hill. He lived elsewhere in Putney until his death on 7 August 1904. name=\\"Ellis\\"> Locomotives =North London= * see: Locomotives of the North London Railway =Great Eastern= * 61 class 0-4-4T * 265 class 4-4-0 * K9 class 0-4-2T * 230 class 0-4-0T * 527 class 2-6-0 =LSWR= * 380 class 4-4-0 * 135 class 4-4-0 * 395 class 0-6-0 * 46 class 4-4-0T (later rebuilt as 4-4-2T) * 415 class 4-4-2T \\"Radial tanks\\" (noted for their long service on the Lyme Regis branch line). * 445 class 4-4-0 * 460 class 4-4-0 * A12 class 0-4-2 \\"Jubilees\\" * T1 class 0-4-4T * O2 class 0-4-4T * X2 class 4-4-0 * T3 class 4-4-0 * B4 class 0-4-0T * G6 class 0-6-0T * T6 class 4-4-0 * X6 class 4-4-0 References * *Bradley, D.L.(1985).

Blood Duster decided to mostly abandon their grind style for this album, delivering instead some catchy Southern rock-style riffs, reminiscent of Lynyrd Skynyrd ‚Äì the band even makes use of a Hammond B3 electronic organ, played by guitarist Finn Alman's mother. The band‚Äôs good-humored offensive lyrics are also present, with the band attacking vegans, girls, hippies, punks, the music industry and even the label itself. The album also features many audio samples from movies. Blood Duster pay homage to Kyuss in two noticeable ways on this album. First, the back cover of the album is identical to the cover of the album \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\" by Kyuss, except the sign has been Photoshopped to read 'Northcote 32, Springvale 20, Compton 6'. Secondly, one of the tracks on the album ends identically to the Kyuss song \\"Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop\\", from the same album.  Reception  AllMusic's William York rated it at two-and-a-half-out- of-five stars and explained, \\"best described as groove-heavy Southern rock played by a death metal/grindcore band, grunting, low-in vocals and all. In between the longer songs ‚Äì and that is relatively speaking, since only four of them are longer than two minutes ‚Äì are a number of short, blasting grindcore tracks.\\" Track listing # \\"Givin' Stiff to the Stiff\\" (Finn Allman, F McCarthy, Jason Fuller) ‚Äì 1:59 # \\"Hippie Kill Team\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:27 # \\"Metal as Fuck\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 3:14 # \\"I Hate Girls and Crusty Punx\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:17 # \\"Chop-Chop\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:45 # \\"Tittie\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:50 # \\"Motherload\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:42 # \\"The Meat Song [Stiffy in McDonalds]\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 1:47 # \\"Death Squad\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:11 # \\"Instrumental I\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 1:43 # \\"The Simple Life\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:30 # \\"Where Does All the Money Go When Releasing a Full Length Album\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 2:38 # \\"It's Just Not Metal\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 1:59 # \\"Celebrating 35% Pig Fat\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:38 # \\"F.S.S\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:35 # \\"Ooh Ahh\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 1:28 # \\"Derek2\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:31 # \\"Roll Call\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 2:27 # \\"Shoved up Your Pisshole\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 2:14 # \\"Ballad of Hoyt\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 0:33 # \\"Pure Digital Silence\\" (Allman, McCarthy, Fuller) ‚Äì 9:56 # [untitled hidden track] ‚Äì 6:56 Track listing credits: Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' or 'Performer:' Credits =Band members= *Tony Forde ‚Äì Vocals *Finn Allman ‚Äì Guitar, vocals on track 17 *Jason P.C. ‚Äì Bass, vocals on tracks 2 and 17 *Euan Heriot ‚Äì Drums =Guests= *Bucky - Guest vocals on Tracks 4 and 7 *Dr Jim - Guest vocals on Track 12 *Kate ‚Äì Guest vocals on Track 7 *Marlana Alman ‚Äì Hammond B3 Organ on Track 5 *Mike F.B. - Guest vocals on Track 14 *Richie Poate - Guitar at end of Track 22 *V (Jason Vasallo) - Guest vocals on Track 14 =Other credits= *Words and music - Jason P.C. and Fin Allman *Artwork - Craig Westwood *Disc art - Simon Moon‚Äôyah! *Art direction ‚Äì Jason P.C. *Photography ‚Äì Samantha Albert  References  Blood Duster albums 1998 albums Relapse Records albums ","title":"Str8 Outta Northcote"},{"id":"4982463","text":"The House of Gwynedd is the royal house of the Kingdom of Gwynedd in Medieval Wales. History The House of Gwynedd is divided between the earlier House of Cunedda, which lasted from c.420-825, and the later House of Aberffraw, beginning in 844. The first is so named after Cunedda, the founding king of Gwynedd; and the second after Aberffraw, the old capital of Gwynedd. The House of Aberffraw became extinct on the death of Owain Lawgoch in 1378. Lineage Under the laws of Hywel Dda, which were adapted from the much earlier pagan Molmutine Laws, any son can inherit from his father. This refers even to illegitimate sons if they are acknowledged by their father. The throne cannot be inherited through the female line unless both her father and the ancestry of her spouse were royal. In many examples cousins were inter-married, which made the distinction somewhat academic. The House of Aberffraw began with the accession of Rhodri Mawr to the throne of Gwynedd. His father Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad had seized the throne of Gwynedd on the death of the last of the old royal line Hywel ap Rhodri Molwynog. He had married the former king's niece Ethyllt verch Cynan ap Rhodri Molwynog and their son, thus uniting both lines, was Rhodri Mawr.

Commonwealth Parliament has power to make laws with respect to insurance and insurance companies under section 51(xiv) (insurance other than state insurance) and (xx) (the corporations power) of the Australian Constitution. Generally, the Insurance Act 1973 and Insurance Contracts Act 1984 are the main acts that apply, however there are a number of other pieces of legislation enacted by the states, private codes and voluminous case law all of which forms the body of insurance law.  Legislation  The Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) sets minimum capital and solvency requirements for companies wanting to enter or operate in the insurance market.Insurance Act 1973 (Cth), s 2A. Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) regulates the way in which insurers and insurance agents and brokers carry on business and how they deal with the people they do business with and intend to do business with. The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (ICA) applies to most insurance contracts with an Australian connection and is intended to ensure that a fair balance is struck between the interests of the insurer and the insured. The primary federal laws affecting the industry include: * Life Insurance Act 1995 (Life Insurance prudential regulation) * Insurance Act 1973 (General Insurance prudential regulation) * Health Insurance Act 2007 (Health insurance prudential regulation and consumer protection) * Corporations Act 2001 (especially Ch 7, consumer protection in respect of insurance policies) * Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (consumer protection in respect of insurance policies) Other legislation which affects the industry includes: * A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Taxation rules in respect to insurance e.g. Division 78) * Privacy Act 1988 (The National Privacy Principles) Further regulations include: * The General Insurance Code of Practice which all general insurer signatories agree to self-regulate under. * Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)  Regulators  The prudential aspects of general, life and health insurance (solvency etc.) are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which has the power under the Insurance Act 1973 to investigate a general insurer, freeze its assets or direct it to take specific action (for example, stop writing new business). The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) is responsible for the general administration of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984.Insurance Contracts Act section 11A. Matters relating to advice or disclosure of insurance products sold are regulated by ASIC. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) also has a regulatory role with respect to competition law. In certain states, various bodies also have powers in regulating certain types of statutory insurance. For example, in New South Wales the Motor Accidents Authority regulates Compulsory Third Party motor liability insurance. In many cases these bodies have powers regarding premium rating and reinsurance rules.  Insurance contract  The formation of an insurance contract is governed by ordinary contractual principlesHalsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, vol. 25 (2003 reissue), [70]. however, as a commercial contract, a policy of insurance should be given a businesslike interpretation \\"having regard to the language used by the parties, the commercial circumstances the document addresses, and the objects which it is intended to secure.\\"Horsell International Pty Ltd v Divetwo Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 368.  Code of Practice  The General Insurance Code of Practice is a self-regulatory code that binds all general insurers who are signatories to it.

It is about making sure our community can maintain its small- town character, something that becomes more important every year for tourism- based communities such as ours. It is about making sure any retailer or any commercial development that comes to town is an appropriate size, has an appearance that fits in with the character of our community and addresses costs for the additional infrastructure (water, sewer, highways, SEQR requirements, etc)... SAGA has decided not to oppose any retailer that meets the following criteria: *Is or less, or a total shopping center of or less; *Is attractive in appearance and develops the area using state of the art methods to minimize the environmental impact of the new structure(s) and parking lot, including light pollution; *Is located in a suitable spot; *Absorbs the additional costs of upgrading all the infrastructure that will be required of a commercial development.\\" The Wal-Mart corporation backed down from its original plans to build in Saranac Lake, but in 2006 announced new plans to build a Supercenter on Lake Flower Avenue.

Their 2000 album \\"Smile\\" is still one of the highest selling metal albums released in Australia despite their rocky relationship with the music industry. Their latest album 'Painted In Blood' featured cover art by infamous blood painter Rev Myers, it was released independently late in 2014. Early years Originally known as Eezee, the band had recorded an EP in 1993 and the 1995 album Rise From Darkness. The group had also played support shows with Morbid Angel, Machine Head and Deicide. The line-up at this time was Christiaan Rand (bass, vocals), Sven Sellin (guitar), James Broadbent (guitar) and John Buckley (drums). The group decided to change its name after moving into in a thrash direction in mid-1994. Formed from a conjunction of the words \\"segregated\\" and \\"aggression\\" (which was later a track on the fourth album), Segression announced its new name on New Year's Day 1996 and played its first show, at the Cambridge Hotel in Newcastle, a few weeks later. By this time, Broadbent had been replaced by Shane Partridge. Some of Broadbent's playing appears on the first album, which was already underway. A show in Sydney with Fear Factory and a rigid touring schedule that took in several centres in regional New South Wales followed. L.I.A., an abbreviation for lesson in aggression, was released in October 1996. In 1997 Segression continued to tour solidly, featuring on several shows of Mortal Sin's comeback tour at the same time as working on its second album. Fifth of the Fifth took its name from a prediction that the world would end on 5 May 2000 and was released in September. The album consolidated the band's success on the Australian metal scene and also saw the introduction of the nu metal elements into their music. During 1998 the group played a national support tour with Ozzy Osbourne and late in the year Buckley was asked to leave due to personal issues, opening the door to Adrian Herbert. Segression toured with Strapping Young Lad soon after, and with this new line-up, Segression then headlined one of the first annual Australian Metal Festivals Metal For The Brain. Then the band toured nationally with Fear Factory, and toured most of Australia doing their own shows or playing smaller festivals. The later part of 1999 was spent writing and recording a new album and playing live rarely. 2000s The early part of 2000 was spent touring with Soulfly which culminated in Chris being asked to perform the song \\"Bleed\\" with Soulfly at the Sydney Big Day Out. The Smile album surfaced in early 2000 during a national tour with Slipknot. The album was released to critical acclaim on Roadrunner Records' Australian development label Dark Carnival. The relationship with Roadrunner soured almost immediately and Segression was forced to do virtually all of the promotion for the album itself but due to the hugely successful tour with Slipknot the Smile album went on to become the most successful of their career, and to this date it is still one of the highest selling metal albums released in Australia . Segression toured extensively behind the \\"Smile\\" album and in fact were voted Best live band, Best Guitarist and Best Vocalist in a public poll held in a high-profile music magazine. After being announced as part of that year's Metal for the Brain festival, Segression decided to withdraw from the show, instead announcing a move to the United States after a final near sold-out Australian tour . Segression moved to Chicago in early 2001 and played some club shows on their own as well as with Hatebreed and Shadows Fall. Although these shows were a success they were mainly there to write and record new material which ended in a week-long recording session at Chicago's Groove Master Studios where Disturbed and Sevendust had recorded albums. They returned to Australia in May to tour nationally with Pantera and Corrosion of Conformity. Adrian decided to leave the band after he could no longer dedicate fully to the band and was replaced by Keith Owen. June 2002 saw the release of the band's fourth album Segression. After a particularly large touring schedule for the album, Segression played a final show in December in Wollongong NSW. After the show the band had gone into the studio to record a follow-up album. This album took a new direction, putting Segression in an unofficial hiatus. 2003 - Side Effect X and hiatus In late 2003, Segression announced that the band was on indefinite hold. With the addition of bass player Michael Caruana, all members of Segression created Side Effect X, a melodic heavy rock band. The new band was announced during the 2003 Musicoz Awards and participated in the 2004 Live 'n Local unsigned bands competition on Channel Ten's Video Hits.http://media.uow.edu.au/news/2004/0213a/index.html That group released a single, \\"Turn the Page\\" and an album called Life featuring music videos for the songs \\"Get Off Me\\", \\"Waste Of Time\\" and \\"Golden Skies\\". After a few shows and a small push by the band for this album they decided to go their separate ways, leaving both Side Effect X and Segression up in the air with no plans for either band to tour or play shows again. Since the disbandment of Side Effect X, \\"Life\\" has been subsequently included within Segression's discography. 2009 - Return and current In mid-2009 a new Myspace and Facebook page became active, and rumours went around that the band was back together. This was later confirmed with an official Facebook page post stating that singer/bass Player Chris Rand, guitarist Shane Partridge and drummer Adrian had in fact reformed the band and in October 2009 the band announced on their Myspace that they will be playing a return show at Sydney's Gaelic Club. Segression's return show on 30 November 2009 was completely sold out. After the success of this show the band decided to return full-time adding guitarist Michael Katselos (Fozzy) with long term guitarist Sven Sellin opting out of the reformation (as he was concentrating on his two other bands, Veil and Sentient). In November 2010 Segression were confirmed as the \\"Special Guests\\" on the December 2010 Australian east coast tour by Fozzy which features WWE star Chris Jericho and Stuck Mojo guitarist Rich Ward. A new album titled \\"Never Dead\\" was released through Riot/Warner on 22 April 2011 and was preceded by a special iTunes only single, \\"Hero Anthem\\" on 18 March 2011 which debuted at #2. According to the band's Facebook and Myspace postings,\\" this album is just us being us completely\\" and it was produced by singer/bassist Chris Rand. \\"Never Dead\\" was possibly one of the band's most critically acclaimed albums and sold very well , reaching Number 1 on iTunes charts and selling out in retail outlets. The band then proceeded to play selected shows to great crowds , although the number of shows has been limited. The music video for \\"Blood Lace Black Day\\" was ranked #21 in the ABC's RAGE top 50 clips of 2011. 2012 - Guitarist Sven Sellin returned to the band replacing Shane Partridge. In January 2013 the band started recording their 6th studio album 'Painted In Blood'. However production hit a hurdle when then drummer Adrian Herbert was unable to play in line with Segression's more aggressive style. In early 2014, Segression concluded they needed a drummer that could play the new material. Sven's long time friend Adam (Adz) Bunnell, who also plays drums in Sven's other bands (Veil/Fuelled Within/Raising Bodhi) replaced Adrian and jumped at the opportunity to play the band's new powerful and dynamic sound . He wasted no time and started recording drums for the new album immediately. In March 2014, with all the songs completed and recorded, the album moved into the final stages of mixing and mastering. With a release expected for the beginning of Spring, 'Painted in Blood' was set to be the band's most solid, ultra tight, bone crushing album ever released . In late September 2014 the band announced a release date of 4 October, but a few days later had to push the album back to its official release date of Friday 10 October. Presale orders for the album started on 27 September. The music video for the opening title track of the album was released on 7 November.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzIpJw86_sc Discography References External links *Facebook *Myspace *YouTube * www.harmonyofhate.com Musical groups established in 1996 New South Wales musical groups Australian heavy metal musical groups Musical groups disestablished in 2003 Musical groups reestablished in 2009 ","title":"Segression"},{"id":"4982549","text":"Colin David Powell (born 7 July 1948) is an English retired professional footballer, active during the 1970s and 1980s.

With Blood Duster having secured an endorsement from the Black Flys sunglasses brand, Jason PC Fuller suggested in an interview with Andrew Tijs of Beat that the band had become \\"corporate rock whores\\" This album took longer to record than previous Blood Duster albums and features a number of guest appearances including Jay Dunne from 28 Days, original AC/DC singer Dave Evans and the complete line-up of Melbourne band The Spazzys. It also contains the singles DrinkFightFuck, SixSixSixteen and IWannaDoItWithADonna. Censorship controversy This album was surrounded by some controversy. There was originally supposed to be bonus CD-ROM material included with the album but, due to censorship rules in Australia and the distributor not putting ratings on it, this material was censored, along with several photos that were to appear in the CD booklet. The CD-ROM was to include live footage of Blood Duster performing Kill Kill Kill, 66.6 on Your FM Dial and Derek, as well as a video of the band performing DrinkFightFuck at the single's launch. There was also a video entitled \\"D-Unit's Metal for the Brain 2005\\" that was censored because it showed certain band members taking drugs, namely cocaine. Some of the material that was supposed to be on the CD-ROM can be accessed at the band's website using the HippieKillTeam password hidden in the CD case. Although some photos were censored in the compiling of the CD booklet, it still contains 125 small colour photos, including some featuring nudity and oral sex.

It is currently the only high school in Newmarket under the jurisdiction of the York Catholic District School Board. There were 1620 full-time registered students for the 2005/2006 year, 95 full-time staff members, and 24 support staff. History In January 1969, the York Region Separate School Board came into existence with the combining of eleven small school boards. Shortly thereafter, the Board passed a motion to Catholic High Schools in Toronto. At their next meeting, trustees faced a parents' delegation protesting the decision. This delegation, in convincing the Board to reverse its stand, showed that support for the concept of Catholic education beyond elementary school was strong. Thus, the Board carried on the tradition of Catholic education and continued to transport students to Catholic high schools in Metropolitan Toronto. In 1973, the Metro Separate School Board declared that these students could no longer be accommodated. Therefore, in 1974, the York Separate School Board decided to establish St. Robert Catholic High School in Thornhill, Ontario. In doing so, the Board made a statement that a second junior high school would be built north of Toronto at a future date \\"if the extension of Catholic education is supported by the Catholic community of York Region\\". St. Robert was a tremendous success and after four years was filled to capacity. The Board, therefore, opened the doors of Sacred Heart Junior High School in September 1979, providing 265 students with a Grades 7 to 9 program. Through the cooperative efforts of the Board and the Toronto Archdiocese High School Commission, Grade 11 was introduced in September 1981 and one grade was added each subsequent year. Simultaneously, a building program was undertaken and beautiful new facilities were made available to students in September 1983. The student population continued to increase and a new addition to the building was opened in May 1987. The Catholic School Council in conjunction with staff and students continue to seek improvements to the school. In 2002 two new additions were added which gave the school a new cafeteria, upgraded physical education equipment and facilities, an expanded library resource centre, a theatre/lecture hall, new administrative offices as well as guidance and special education additions. Another major renovation took place in the summer of 2004. The entire second floor of the old wing received new Science Labs and Art Rooms. Sports and athletics Sacred Heart Catholic High School's sports teams are known as the Crusaders. The school's mascot is Corky, a lovable knight dressed in armor, who is known for his playful and sometimes absurd attitude while attending Crusader home games. Sacred Heart competes in a variety of different sports including: *Boys'/Girls' Basketball *Boys'/Girls' Soccer *Boys'/Girls' Hockey *Boys'/Girls' Volleyball *Boys'/Girls' Rugby *Cross Country Running *Track and Field *Tennis *Ultimate *Swimming *Golf *Curling *Softball *Badminton *Baseball The 2020 Athletic award Winners were announced in May, some of the Junior winners are: Nolan Verboomen - Junior Boys Golf MVP Presented by: M.

Throughout the past few years, Sacred Heart has participated biannually in the Canadian Cancer Society's biggest fundraiser, Relay For Life. The school has been very successful each time they have participated and are among the top school's in the country. Since 2009, they have raised over $550,000 for cancer research. In the spring of 2012, Sacred Heart's students' raised over $150,000, the highest amount ever raised by any high school in Canada. The graduating class were featured on a CTV News broadcast. They raised $143,000 in 2014. Led by Aaron Zhang in 2016, the students raised over $186,000, setting both a personal and Canada- wide record yet again. Clubs and activities Cru's News is the school's monthly newspaper. They publish articles describing the exiting events that occur around the school, and share what the different clubs and teams are up to.

(Apple Computer, Inc. at the start of the campaign) by TBWA\\\\Media Arts Lab, the company's advertising agency, that ran from 2006 to 2009. The advertisements were shown in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Synopsis The Get a Mac advertisements follow a standard template. They open to a minimalist all-white background, and a man dressed in casual clothes introduces himself as an Apple Macintosh computer (\\"Hello, I'm a Mac.\\"), while a man in a more formal suit-and-tie combination introduces himself as a Microsoft Windows personal computer (\\"And I'm a PC.\\"). The two then act out a brief vignette, in which the capabilities and attributes of Mac and PC are compared, with PC‚Äîcharacterized as formal and somewhat polite, though uninteresting and overly concerned with work‚Äîoften being frustrated by the more laid-back Mac's abilities. The earlier commercials in the campaign involved a general comparison of the two computers, whereas the later ones mainly concerned Windows Vista and Windows 7. The aim of this commercial film series is to associate PC users (namely Windows users) with the \\"unpopular nerd\\" clich√©, while representing Apple Mac users as young, creative, attractive and lucky. The original American advertisements star actor Justin Long as the Mac, and author and humorist John Hodgman as the PC, and were directed by Phil Morrison. The American advertisements also air on Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand television, and at least 24 of them were dubbed into Spanish, French, German, and Italian. The British campaign stars comedic duo Robert Webb as Mac and David Mitchell as PC while the Japanese campaign features the comedic duo Rahmens. Several of the British and Japanese advertisements, although based on the originals, were slightly altered to better target the new audiences. Both the British and Japanese campaigns also feature several original ads not seen in the American campaign. The Get a Mac campaign is the successor to the Switch ads that were first broadcast in 2002. Both campaigns were filmed against a plain white background. Apple's former CEO, Steve Jobs, introduced the campaign during a shareholders meeting the week before the campaign started. The campaign also coincided with a change of signage and employee apparel at Apple retail stores detailing reasons to switch to Macs. The Get a Mac campaign received the Grand Effie Award in 2007. The song in the commercial is called \\"Having Trouble Sneezing\\" composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. Advertisements The ads play on perceived weaknesses of non-Mac personal computers, especially those running Microsoft Windows, of which PC is clearly intended to be a parody, and corresponding strengths possessed by the Mac OS (such as immunity to circulating viruses and spyware targeted at Microsoft Windows). The target audience of these ads is not devoted PC users but rather, those who are more likely to \\"swing\\" towards Apple. Apple realizes that many consumers who choose PCs do so because of their lack of knowledge of the Apple brand. With this campaign, Apple was targeting those users who may not consider Macs when purchasing but may be persuaded to when they view these ads. Each of the ads is about 30 seconds in length and is accompanied by a song called \\"Having Trouble Sneezing,\\" which was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. The advertisements are presented below in alphabetical order, not chronological order. North American campaign The following is an alphabetical list of the ads that appeared in the campaign shown in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. *Accident‚ÄîA wheelchair-bound PC, who is wearing casts on his arms, explains that he fell off his desk when someone tripped over his power cord, thus prompting Mac to point out that the MacBook's and MacBook Pro's magnetic power cord prevents such an occurrence. The Macbook pictured at the end demonstrates a harmless cord disconnection. *Angel/Devil‚ÄîMac gives PC an iPhoto book to view. Suddenly, angel and devil versions of PC appear behind him. The angel encourages PC to compliment Mac, while the devil prods PC to destroy the book. In the end, PC says the book is good and then turns around, feeling the air where the angel and devil versions of himself were. *Bake Sale‚ÄîWhen Mac questions PC regarding a bake sale he has set up, PC replies that he is trying to raise money by himself in order to fix Vista's problems. Mac decides to contribute by buying a cupcake, but as soon as he takes a bite, PC asks him to pay ten million dollars for it. *Bean Counter‚ÄîPC is trying to balance his budget, admitting that Vista's problems are frustrating PC users and it's time to take drastic action: spending almost all of the money on advertising. When Mac asks PC if he thinks the small amount of money left will fix Vista, PC reallocates all of it to advertising. This ad coincided with the introduction of Microsoft's \\"I'm a PC\\" campaign. *Better‚ÄîMac praises PC's ability with spreadsheets but explains that he is better with life-related activities such as music, pictures, and movies. PC defensively asks what Mac means by \\"better,\\" only to sheepishly claim a different definition when Mac tells him. *Better Results‚ÄîPC and Mac discuss making home movies and show each other their efforts. Supermodel Gisele B√ºndchen enters, representing Mac's movie, while PC's movie is represented by a man with a hairy chest wearing a blonde wig and a dress similar to B√ºndchen's. PC states that his movie is a \\"work-in- progress.\\" *Biohazard Suit‚ÄîPC first appears wearing a biohazard suit to protect himself from PC viruses and malware, of which PC says there are 20,000 discovered every day. Mac asks PC if he is going to live in the suit for the rest of his life, but PC cannot hear him because he is too protected by his virus-proof mask, and takes it off. PC then shrieks and struggles to place it on again. *Boxer‚ÄîPC is introduced by a ring announcer as if he were in a boxing match, stating that he's not going down without a fight. Mac explains that the issue is not a competition but, rather, people switching to a computer that's simpler and more intuitive. The announcer admits his brother- in-law recently purchased a Mac and loves it. This is also the first ad to show Mac OS X Leopard. *Breakthrough‚ÄîMac and PC's therapist (played by Corinne Bohrer, see \\"Counselor\\" below) suggest that PC's problems are simply a result of software and hardware coming from various sources, whereas Mac gets all his hardware and software from one place. PC keeps repeating \\"It's not my fault!\\" with support of Mac and the therapist before concluding, \\"It's Mac's fault! It's Mac's fault!\\" Mac and the therapist are disappointed in PC's conclusion, but PC nevertheless ends with the comment \\"What a Breakthrough!\\" *Broken Promises‚ÄîPC tells Mac how excited he is about the launch of Windows 7 and assures him it won't have the same problems as Vista. However, Mac feels like he has heard this before and has a series of flashbacks with past versions of PC assuring him about Windows Vista, XP, ME, 98, 95, and 2.0. On the last flashback, PC says, \\"Trust me.\\" Back in the present, he explains this time it's going to be different and says, \\"Trust me,\\" in an almost identical way to his flashback counterpart. *Calming Teas‚ÄîPC announces calming teas and bath salts to make Vista's annoyances easier to live with, such as \\"Crashy-time Chamomile\\", \\"Missing Driver Mint\\", \\"Pomegranate Patience\\", and \\"Raspberry Restart\\". He doesn't get time to talk about his bath salts. *Choose a Vista‚ÄîConfused about which of the six versions of Windows Vista to get, PC spins a large game show wheel. PC lands on Lose a Turn, and Mac questions why PC put that space on the wheel. *Computer Cart‚ÄîPC and three other men in suits are on a computer cart. When Mac asks why, PC says that he gets an error with a Windows Media Player Dynamic-link library file (WMP.DLL), and that the others suffer from similar errors. The man in the beige suit represents error 692, the man in the grey suit represents a Syntax error, and the man in the bottom of the cart represents a fatal system error (PC whispers, \\"He's a goner,\\" at the commercial's end). Mac explains that Macs don't get cryptic error messages. *Counselor‚ÄîPC and Mac visit a psychotherapist (played by Corinne Bohrer) to resolve their differences. While Mac finds it easy to compliment PC (\\"You are a wizard with numbers and you dress like a gentleman.\\"), PC's resentment is too deep for him to reciprocate (\\"I guess you are better at creating stuff, even though it's completely juvenile and a waste of time.\\"). The counselor suggests that they come twice a week. *Customer Care‚ÄîMac is seen with a Mac Genius from an Apple Retail Store's Genius Bar, who can fix Mac problems. PC then has a short montage of endless automated customer-support messages, never reaching a real person, much to his disappointment. PC then says that his source of help is \\"the same\\" as a Mac Genius. *Elimination‚ÄîPC attempts to find Megan, a new laptop hunter, the perfect PC. He starts by eliminating from a lineup of fellow PCs all those who have too-small screens and too-slow processors. However, none of the PCs is \\"immune\\" to viruses, which is Megan's #1 concern, so PC leaves her with Mac. *Flashback‚ÄîMac asks PC if he would like to see the website and home movie that he made. This prompts PC to remember a time when both he and Mac were children: when the younger Mac asks the younger PC if he would like to see some artwork he did, the younger PC takes out a calculator and calculates the time they have just wasted (This may be a reference to the time when PC's were text-based, while Macs were slower but had GUIs). Returning from the flashback, PC does the same thing. *Genius‚ÄîMac introduces PC to one of the Mac Geniuses from the Apple Retail Store's Genius Bar. PC tests the Genius, starting with math questions, which culminates in asking her, on a scale of one to ten, how much does he loathe Mac, to which she answers \\"Eleven.\\" Surprised, PC says \\"She's good. Very good.\\" *Gift Exchange‚ÄîMac and PC exchange gifts for Christmas. PC, who is hoping for a C++ GUI programming guide, is disappointed to receive a photo album of previous Get a Mac ads made on iPhoto. In contrast, he gives Mac a C++ GUI programming guide. *Goodwill‚ÄîMac and PC agree to put aside their differences because of the Christmas season. Although PC momentarily slips and states that Mac wastes his time with frivolous pursuits like home movies and blogs, the two agree, as Mac says, to \\"Pull it into hug harbor,\\" and they wish each other a good holiday. *Group‚ÄîPC is at a support group for PCs living with Vista. The other PCs there tell him to take it one day at a time and that he is facing the biggest fact of all‚Äîthat Vista isn't working as it should. They all wish the Vista problems will go away sooner and a lot easier. One of them says pleasingly that he has been error-free for a week, but he starts to repeat himself uncontrollably, discouraging the others. *iLife‚ÄîPC listens to an iPod and praises iTunes. Mac replies that the rest of iLife works just as well and comes on every Mac. PC defensively responds by listing the cool apps that he comes with, but he can only identify a calculator and a clock. *I Can Do Anything‚ÄîIn this animated commercial designed for the holiday season, PC asks Mac why the former loves the holidays so much. Mac asks if it's the season for peace on earth, but PC replies that they get to be animated and can do anything. PC demonstrates by floating in the air, building a snowman in fast motion, and asking a hopping bunny where he is going. The bunny, who can speak, says he's going to the Apple Store for some last-minute gifts. PC then purposely tips off the snowman's head, making it fall on the bunny, and sarcastically apologizes to him, calling himself clumsy. The animation style for this ad mimics the Rankin/Bass animation style seen in a number of classic Christmas specials. *Legal Copy‚ÄîEvery time PC says something positive about himself, the legal copy that appears on the screen bottom increases. He finally states that PCs are now 100% trouble-free, and the legal copy covers the whole screen. *Meant for Work‚ÄîPC, looking haggard and covered in stickers, complains about the children who use him and their activities, such as making movies and blogging, which are wearing him out. He also says he cries himself to sleep mode every night, complaining that, unlike Mac, he is meant more for office work. PC is then alerted because his user wants to listen to some emo music and, with a loud groan, trudges off, showing an Anarchy sticker on his back. *Misprint‚ÄîPC is on the phone withPC World, attempting to report a misprint. He explains how the print said, \\"The fastest Windows Vista notebook we tested this year is a Mac.\\" PC argues how impossible it is for a Mac to run Vista faster than a PC, while Mac tries to explain that it is true. While arguing with PCWorld over the phone, PC says that he'll put Mac on the line to set things straight. However, he instead impersonates Mac, saying that PCs are faster. *Network‚ÄîMac and PC are holding hands to demonstrate their ability to network with each other. A Japanese woman representing a new digital camera enters and takes Mac's free hand. While Mac and the camera are perfectly compatible and speak to each other fluently, PC‚Äîwho cannot speak Japanese‚Äîis utterly confused and unable to communicate, representing that Windows PCs need a driver installation with virtually all new hardware. This commercial has been criticized as being projectory and blame shifting, because Apple is infamous for having a proprietary system that is isolated from open standards (e.g. no support for Bluetooth filesharing, WiFi Direct, NFC filesharing; no USB charging connector on the iPhone, lack of modularity (no MicroSD-expandable storage in iPhones), etc.). *Now What‚ÄîPC begins by showing off his new, long book,I Want to Buy a Computer ‚Äî Now What? to help customers deal with all the difficult computer-buying decisions if they have no one to help. Mac then explains that, at Apple Stores, personal shoppers help customers find the perfect Mac, even offering workshops to teach people about using the computers. Upon hearing this, PC brings out his book's companion volume,I Just Bought a Computer ‚Äî Now What? *Office Stress‚ÄîMac's new Microsoft Office 2008 has just been released. In the box that PC gives Mac is a stress toy for him to use when he gets overwhelmed from doing lots more work. However, PC begins using the toy, complaining that Microsoft Office is also compatible with Mac, that he wants to switch his files over, and that he is getting less work than Mac, eventually breaking the toy. *Off the Air‚ÄîMac and PC appear with a Mac Genius, who announces it is now easier than ever to switch to a Mac and that a Mac Genius can switch over a PC files to a new Mac for free. PC then protests that fear that keeps people from switching, and people don't need to hear about the Mac Genius. In protest, he pulls a cover over the camera, which has a test card drawn on it, and declares that they are off the air. *Out of the Box‚ÄîMac (in a white box) and PC (in a brown box doing some exercises) are discussing what they will do when they are unpacked. Mac says that he can get started right away, but PC is held up by the numerous activities that he must complete before being useful. Mac eventually leaves to get right to work, but PC is forced to wait for parts that are still in other boxes. *Party is Over‚ÄîPC unhappily throws a party celebrating the release of Windows Vista. He complains to Mac that he had to upgrade his hardware and now can't use some of his old software and peripherals. He then talks with one of the party members about throwing another party in five years, which turns into five years and a day, and so on. *PC Choice Chat‚ÄîPC has his own radio talk show called PC Choice Chat, and people begin to call in asking for advice on which computer to get. All the callers ask for advice on a computer that would qualify as a Mac but not as a PC. One caller asks for a computer for people who hate getting viruses, another caller asks for PC help like Mac Geniuses, and a third caller wants to switch to Mac altogether. PC ignores these calls. *PC Innovations Lab‚ÄîPC has wrapped another PC in bubble wrap, saying that the Bubble Wrap is actually a security shield. Mac tries to speak, but PC cuts him off, showing another PC who apparently has cupholders on his shoulders. The cupholders are full of foam coffee cups, and PC takes a full coffee cup, pretending to toast the cup and saying, \\"Cheers to innovation\\". *PC News‚ÄîPC is sitting at a news desk and turns it over to a correspondent at what seems to be a launch party for Windows 7. A person being interviewed reveals that he is switching to a Mac. PC is surprised by this and asks why, but more people speak of how Mac is #1 with customer satisfaction until PC finally says to cut the feed. He then suggests going to commercial, but Mac acknowledges that they are in a commercial, so PC instead suggests going to another commercial. *Pep Rally‚ÄîPC is introduced by a cheerleading squad. When asked, PC explains Mac's number-one status on college campuses with a built-in iSight camera, a stable operating system, and an ability to run Microsoft Office so well, so he wants to win students back with a pep rally. The cheerleaders cheer, \\"Mac's Number One!\\" and upon PC's complaint, they cheer, \\"PC's Number Two!\\" *Pizza Box‚ÄîPC tries to attract college students by posing as a free box of pizza. This ad was aired during Apple's 2008 back-to-school promotion. *Podium‚ÄîPC, in the style of a political candidate, is standing at a podium making declarations about Windows Vista, urging those who are having compatibility problems with existing hardware to simply replace them and to ignore the new features of Mac OS X Leopard. However, he privately admits to Mac that he himself has downgraded to Windows XP three weeks ago. His key slogan is: \\"It's not about what Vista can do for you; it's what you can buy for Vista.\\" *PR Lady‚ÄîMac and PC are joined by a public relations representative (played by Mary Chris Wall), who has been hired by PC to place a positive spin on the reaction to Windows Vista and claims that many people are even downgrading back to Windows XP. Her response to claims that more people are switching to Mac instead is a sheepish \\"No comment.\\" *Referee‚ÄîA referee is present, according to PC, to make sure that Mac doesn't go on saying that Leopard is better and faster than Vista. When Mac defends himself, saying it was The Wall Street Journal that compared the two, PC complains, and the referee sides with Mac. Upon insulting the referee, PC is ejected, but PC rebuts, saying that he has nowhere to go (in the ad's area). *Restarting‚ÄîMac and PC explain how they both have a lot in common, but their discussion is hampered by PC's unfortunate habit of freezing and restarting. *Sabotage‚ÄîPC is present, but a different actor (Robert Webb in UK version) appears in Mac's place, obviously reciting poorly memorized lines to flatter PC. The real Mac arrives soon after, and, while PC denies anything is happening, the impostor Mac tells the real Mac that he is a big fan of his. *Sad Song‚ÄîPC sings a short country-and-Western-style song to express his grievances about people leaving PCs for Macs and Vista's technical issues. A hound-dog then howls, which Mac says is a \\"nice touch.\\" A longer version ends with Mac asking PC if the dog is his, which it isn't. *Sales Pitch‚ÄîAlthough Mac introduces himself as usual, PC says, \\"And buy a PC.\\" He explains that Mac's increasing popularity is forcing him to be more forward in his self- promotion, so he is reduced to holding up red signs depicting various pitches. *Santa Claus‚ÄîAnother animated Get a Mac commercial featuring Santa Claus and Christmas caroling by both PC and Mac. PC spoils the group's singing of \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" by inserting \\"Buy a PC and not a Mac this holiday season or any other time for goodness sake,\\" and claims, \\"That's how I learned it.\\" The animation style is similar to the Rankin/Bass television specials Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer andSanta Claus Is Comin' to Town. *Security‚ÄîIn a reference to criticisms of Windows Vista's security features, PC is a joined by a tall United States Secret Service-style bodyguard who represents Vista's new security feature. The guard intrusively demands PC's decisions to cancel or allow every incoming or outgoing interaction he has with Mac. *Self Pity‚ÄîMac, for once, is wearing a suit. He explains that he \\"does work stuff, too,\\" and has been running Microsoft Office for years. Upon hearing this, PC becomes despondent and collapses on the floor, begging to be left alone to depreciate. *Stuffed‚ÄîPC enters slowly with a ballooned torso, explaining that all the trial software is slowing him down. Mac replies that Macs only come with the specific software for which customers ask (namely, the iLife package). As PC finally gets on his mark, Mac begins his intro again, but PC realizes that he has forgotten something and begins to slowly leave. *Stacks‚ÄîPC is searching through all of his pictures, trying to find a photograph of his friend. He searches one picture at a time, but Mac states that iPhoto has a feature called Faces, in which iPhoto can tag the face of a person and find other pictures of the same person, putting them all into the same folder and saving search time. PC responds to the facial-recognition technology as expensive and tells Mac to sort the pictures instead because he has the technology to make it easier. *Surgery‚ÄîPC appears in the garb of a patient awaiting surgery, and explains that he is upgrading to Windows Vista but requires surgery to upgrade (specifically, upgrading such items as graphics cards, processors, memory, etc.). In reference to perceived difficulties in upgrading, PC admits that he is worried about going through it and bequeaths his peripherals to Mac should he not survive. Mac asks PC if, like him, his upgrade could be straightforward. *Surprise‚ÄîMac appears alongside a customer (Andr√©e Vermeulen) with PC notably absent. Mac tries to convince the customer, who wants to buy an effective computer, that she should get a PC, telling her that they're much better and more stable. The customer seems skeptical, tells Mac she'll \\"think about it\\", and leaves. A frustrated Mac pulls off a mask and his clothes, revealing himself to be PC in disguise. The real Mac then appears, sees PC's discarded mask and clothes, and says, \\"I don't even want to ask.\\" *Tech Support‚ÄîA technician is present to install a webcam on PC (using masking tape to attach it to his head). PC is extremely pleased by his new upgrade, but upon hearing from the technician that Mac has a built-in webcam, he storms off without waiting for the camera to be fully installed. *Teeter Tottering‚ÄîA woman who had a PC has a box of things that were in her PC and says she's switching to Mac. PC tries to convince her to stay while she goes over to Mac every time. *Throne‚ÄîPC appears in a king's robe and on a throne saying, even though switching computers can be difficult, his subjects won't leave him and that he's still the \\"king\\" of computers. Mac then begins talking about how PC's subjects can bring their PC into an Apple Store wherein all PC files can be transferred over to a new Mac, at which point PC declares Mac banished. *Time Machine‚ÄîMac appears with nine clones of himself behind him, who all introduce themselves at once. PC is shocked, so the various Macs explain that it is simply Time Machine, a feature in Leopard that makes regular backups of a user's hard drive. PC is forced to admit that such a feature is pretty awesome followed by thanks from the various Macs. *Time Traveler‚ÄîPC uses a time machine to travel to the year 2150 to see if any major issues such as freezing and crashing have been removed from the PC and to see if PCs will eventually be as hassle-free as Macs are. Promptly after PC arrives in 2150, his future self freezes, which answers the question. *Top of the Line‚ÄîPC and Mac appear with a customer who is looking for a new computer. PC introduces her to the \\"top of the line\\" PC (Patrick Warburton), a handsome and overly slick PC in a suit. She asks him about screen size and speed, to which the top-of-the-line PC says he's the best. However, he balks when she says she doesn't want to deal with any viruses or hassle. She decides to go with Mac, so the top-of-the-line PC hands her his business card and tells her, \\"When you're ready to compromise...you call me.\\" *Touch√©‚ÄîRight after PC introduces himself, Mac replies, \\"And I'm a PC, too.\\" Mac explains to the confused PC that he can run both Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, calling himself \\"the only computer you'll ever need.\\" PC mutters, \\"Oh...touch√©.\\" Mac explains, referring to the rules of fencing, that one only says touch√© after he or she makes a point and someone else makes a counterpoint, but PC continues to misuse the word. A similar conversation occurred inDodgeball: A True Underdog Story, a film in which Justin Long (Mac) appeared. *Trainer‚ÄîThe commercial starts off traditionally, but PC is doing sit-ups with a trainer in a striped shirt (Robert Loggia), whose fierce coaching style discourages PC. PC suggests the trainer try some \\"positive reinforcement,\\" but the trainer compliments Mac instead, and PC is offended. Also is the first one to show Mac OS X Snow Leopard. *Tree Trimming‚ÄîIn another animated Get a Mac commercial for the holiday season, Mac and PC set aside their disagreements and decide to trim a Christmas tree by hanging ornaments and stringing lights. Mac tells PC that they are good friends, while PC gets nervous. When they are finished, PC does not want to light the lights on the tree, but Mac persuades him to do so. PC plugs in the tree's lights, but, when illuminated, the lights spell: \\"PC RULES.\\" He apologizes to Mac and says that it \\"just sort of happened.\\" *Trust Mac‚ÄîPC, in an attempt to hide from spyware, is wearing a trench coat, a fedora, dark glasses, and a false mustache. PC offers Mac a disguise, but Mac declines, saying he does not have to worry about the normal PC spyware and viruses with Mac OS X Leopard. *V Word‚ÄîPC declares that people should to stop referring to his operating system (Vista) by name. He says using the word \\"doesn't sit well with frustrated PC users. From now on, we're going to use a word with a lot less baggage:'Windows.'\\" During the scene, he holds a black box with a large red button that sounds a buzzer when pressed. PC presses the button whenever Mac says Vista. After pointing out that not using the word isn't the same as fixing the operating system's problems, Mac ends the ad by saying Vista several times in rapid succession, thwarting PC's attempts to sound the buzzer. *Viruses‚ÄîPC has caught a new virus (represented as a cold) and warns Mac to stay away from him, citing the 114,000 known viruses for PCs. Mac states the viruses that affect PCs do not affect him, and PC announces that he will crash before collapsing onto the floor in a faint. *Work vs. Home‚ÄîMac describes how he enjoys doing fun activities such as podcasts and movies, which leads PC to claim that he also does fun activities such as timesheets, spreadsheets, and pie charts. After Mac states that it's difficult to capture a family vacation using a pie chart, PC rebuts by showing a pie chart representing \\"hanging-out time\\" and \\"just kicking it\\" with different shades of gray. Mac replies, \\"I feel like I was there.\\" *Wall Street Journal‚ÄîMac is reading a favorable review of himself by Walt Mossberg in The Wall Street Journal. Jealous, PC claims he also received a great review but is caught off-guard when Mac asks for specific details. This ad is currently not available on the Apple website but can be found on YouTube. *Yoga‚ÄîMac is watching PC have a yoga session in which the yoga instructor (Judy Greer) is coaching PC in expelling bad Vista energy and forgetting Vista's problems. When the yoga instructor goes on to complain that Vista caused errors in her yoga billing and then storms off, PC considers switching to pilates. Web- exclusive campaign Several advertisements have been shown exclusively in Flash ad campaigns running on numerous websites. Unlike the ads shown on television, these advertisements have not been posted as high-quality QuickTime videos on Apple's website. These ads run for approximately 20 seconds each and reference specific online advertising features (such as banner ads), making it unlikely they will ever appear on television. The titles are taken from the Flash-video file names. *Banging‚ÄîPC expresses his regret for upgrading to Windows Vista because it is causing him various problems. Mac tries to comfort him, but PC continues to bang his head on the side of the banner advertisement. * Booby Trap‚Äî PC and Mac are at PCMag. PC is angry that they put up a banner ad saying that iLife '09 is the best office suite. PC hooks some cables up to the banner claiming that whoever clicks that will get shocked. PC proves it himself by clicking it. * Claw‚ÄîIn a skyscraper ad, PC is using a grabber claw to try to grab a boxed copy of Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac that is sitting in the top banner ad. He claims that if people see that Office 08 is on the Mac, that they will ask questions regarding what a PC can do that the Mac can't. Mac points out that Office has been on the Mac for years, and that this is simply the latest version. PC knocks over the Office box, which causes an alarm to go off. PC hands the grabber claw to Mac, saying \\"He did it!\\" * Cramped‚ÄîIn the only known UK web-exclusive ad, PC and Mac (portrayed by Mitchell and Webb) are lying head-to-head in a banner ad, complaining about the size and format of the banner ad, and encouraging the user to click the ad quicker. * Customer Experience‚ÄîA banner ad shows that Mac is rated #1 among customers experience. PC is frustrated and goes to more opinions from a before and after hair ad. Both say that the Mac is better. * Customer Satisfaction‚ÄîA \\"Mac Customer Satisfaction Score\\" meter appears in a banner ad above Mac and PC. The meter's needle is hovering at about 85 out of 100. PC excuses himself and climbs up to the upper banner ad, and pulls on the needle. He accidentally breaks off the tip of the meter, and then waves it at the 20 mark, saying \\"Customer satisfaction is dropping...\\" *Easy as 1‚Äì23‚ÄîIn a Web banner, PC shows Mac his new slogan. Mac assumes it means \\"PC. Easy as 1-2-3,\\" but PC corrects him by stating it means \\"Easy as 1 through 23\\". He then pulls out 23 steps for using a PC. * Editorial‚ÄîPC drags his own op-ed column into the banner ad (since these ads appeared on news sites, such as cnn.com, it \\"blends\\" in with the rest of the site). The op-ed headline says \\"Stop Switching to Mac!\\" PC explains that people are switching to Macs more than ever, and that they need to know how much it is hurting PC. He makes a couple of anguished poses in the photo box to illustrate how frustrated he is. *Hiding‚ÄîPC peeks in from the left side of the screen. When Mac asks what PC is doing, PC explains that he is hiding from viruses and spyware. PC then leaves, saying that he has to run a scan. There are two versions of this ad: a 300x250 square ad and a 160x600 vertical banner ad. PC is identical in both versions, but Mac's performance features a different take in each. *Knocking‚ÄîPC panics about needing to search for new drivers for his hardware now that he's upgraded to Windows Vista. He tries to force his way off the left side of the screen so he can leave to find the new drivers but repeatedly runs into a wall. When he finally succeeds in breaking through the left side of the screen, he finds himself jumping back in from the right side of the screen. * Newswire‚ÄîPC, jealous of Mac's good press, gets his own newswire ticker above the ad. Unfortunately, the newswire displays unflattering headlines such as \\"Vista Users Upset Over Glitches\\" and \\"Users Downgrade to XP.\\" PC says he hates his stupid newswire and then the next headline on the newswire is \\"PC Hates His Stupid Newswire.\\" *Not‚ÄîA banner ad on the top of the page reads, \\"Leopard is better and faster than Vista.\\" ‚ÄîWall Street Journal. On the side, Mac introduces himself while PC climbs a ladder. Mac asks what PC is doing and he says that he is fixing an embarrassing typo. He then climbs all the way to the top and staples a piece of paper that says NOT at the end of the quotation. He then tells Mac that they have the whole Internet to correct and asks Mac to grab the ladder. *PC Turf (PCMag and PCWorld exclusive)‚ÄîPC welcomes Web surfers to his turf, PCWorld.com, and remarks that Mac must feel out of place there. Mac points out that they said some great things about Macs, so PC asks security to remove Mac because he's going to be a problem. The PCMag version is identical, except PC's voice is re-dubbed to say \\"PCMag.com.\\" * Refresh‚ÄîA banner ad on the top of the page reads, \\"Vista...one of the biggest blunders in technology?\\" ‚ÄîCNET.com. Off to the side, PC sees the banner and realizes its another bad review of Vista and decides to do an emergency refresh. He walks over and opens a compartment door that says, \\"Emergency Banner Refresh.\\" PC flips the switch, and the banner is replaced by another banner that reads, \\"It's time for a Vista do-over\\" ‚ÄîPC Magazine. PC, frustrated about this review, flips the switch again. The banner is replaced by another that reads, \\"Mac OS X Leopard: A Perfect 10\\" ‚ÄîInfoWorld. PC sees this positive review and is relieved until he realizes it's about Leopard. PC angrily flips the switch again to end the ad. *Sign‚ÄîIn a skyscraper ad, Mac asks PC about an unlit sign in a separate banner ad that reads, \\"DON'T GIVE UP ON VISTA.\\" PC replies that it will stop the problem of frustrated Windows Vista users downgrading to XP or switching to Macs. He presses a button, lighting up only the GIVE UP part of the sign. He presses it again, lighting up ON VISTA. Frustrated, PC presses the button repeatedly, causing GIVE UP and ON VISTA to light up alternately. * Switcher Cams‚ÄîA banner ad at the top of the page displays a bank of 5 security camera screens which show users walking into Apple Stores; as users walk past each camera \\"PC SWITCHER\\" lights up in red beneath each screen. On the side, PC sees the switchers and is disappointed they are upgrading to Mac instead of to Windows 7. Mac says he thought Windows 7 was \\"supposed to be an improvement\\", to which PC responds that Macs are still #1 in customer satisfaction and that people will have to move their files over anyway. Still observing the switchers, PC leaves the side and appears on one of the video screens, managing to stop one switcher from going into the Apple Store but says there are still \\"thousands and thousands to go\\". UK campaign Mitchell and Webb as PC and Mac For the British market, the ads were recast with the popular British comedy double act Mitchell and Webb in the lead roles; David Mitchell as PC and Robert Webb as Mac. As well as original ads, several ads from the American campaign were reshot with new dialogue and slightly altered scenes. These ads are about 40 seconds long, which is slightly longer than the US advertisements. The following ads are exclusive to the UK: *Art Language‚ÄîIn an effort to relate to the creative artistic types whom he assumes own Macs, PC, dressed in a stereotypically bohemian fashion, begins speaking to Mac using unnecessarily pretentious language. Despite Mac's insistence that he enables anyone to be creative, PC continues using big words, eventually confusing even himself. *Court‚ÄîPC, dressed in a barrister's outfit, questions Mac on how long it takes to make an iPhoto photo book that Mac claims to have made in a few minutes. Doubting Mac's claim, PC eventually resorts to cutting off Mac whenever he tries to speak. *Magic‚ÄîExchanging an average 50k Word document in a file to Mac, PC makes out that the process is much harder than it actually is through the use of a drum roll and a magician's assistant, and shouting \\"Amazing!\\" at the end of the transfer. Bemused, Mac points out that he is compatible with PC and passes him back a photo with no fuss at all, at the end of which PC shouts \\"Amazing!\\" *Naughty Step‚ÄîPC unveils his naughty step: the ultimate deterrent to an unruly errant child (similar to the technique used by Jo Frost in the UK and US series Supernanny). He goes on to explain that children should not be making pictures, movies and websites on a proper, grown-up PC. Mac points out that this is the fun stuff children like to do, resulting in his own banishment to the naughty step. * Office at Home‚ÄîPC is proud of his role in both the office and the home, but Mac retaliates by stating that homes are not run like offices, and thus shouldn't have office computers. PC eagerly begins to describe the ways in which homes can be run like offices, with his increasing authoritarianism prompting Mac to sarcastically comment that PC's home sounds like a fun place. *Office Posse‚ÄîPC wonders why Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word and Entourage) are standing with Mac and is surprised when Mac says that he runs Office also. PC attempts to order and then entice the Office members to join him, but they refuse, resulting in what Mac calls an awkward moment. * Tentacle‚ÄîPC praises Britain's work ethic, chastising Mac's insistence on the need for fun in life. In attempting to persuade Mac of his point of view, PC employs the use of several animal metaphors, but becomes sidetracked through his increasingly eager musing about the practical applications of octopus tentacles in an office. Several American ads were modified for the UK market. In some of these ads, the events that occur in the narrative differ significantly from the original American campaign. Others follow the original ads more closely, with only minor differences (many based on the differences in characterization from the actors involved or language differences between American English and British English). These ads are also performed by Mitchell and Webb. The adapted ads are *Accident‚ÄîThe ad follows the same narrative, with a different ending: PC, clearly heavily drugged, requests to be pushed over to the window so he can look at the pigeons, only for Mac to point out that there are no pigeons nor a window. PC responds with a dreamy \\"You're funny....\\" *Network‚ÄîThe ad follows the same narrative, but in the British version Mac connects with a Japanese printer instead of a digital camera. PC is also more involved in the dialogue, attempting to communicate in Japanese with the printer, only to mangle his words, first declaring that he is a rice cake before asking, \\"Where is the train station?\\" This larger involvement of PC, when compared to PC in the American ad, is also shown by the appearance of subtitles whenever PC, Mac, or the printer speak in Japanese; in the American ad, there are no subtitles translating Mac and the camera's dialogue, further evidencing that PC is lost in the conversation. *Out of the Box‚ÄîThe ad is almost exactly the same as the American version. However, Mac doesn't mention his built-in camera. Also, at the end, PC pulls out an extremely thick user manual and starts reading it. *Pie Chart‚ÄîThe ad is based on the American Work vs. Home. The light-grey area of PC's family holiday pie chart now represents shennanigans and tomfoolery and the dark-grey area represents hijinks. Also, PC further divides hijinks into capers, monkey business, and just larking about. * Restarting‚ÄîThe ad follows much the same narrative as the American ad, with the only major difference being that after Mac has left to get someone from IT, PC awakens and wonders where everyone has gone. * Stuffed‚ÄîThis ad contains no significant changes from the American version. * Trust Mac‚ÄîThe ad follows the same narrative as the American version, but at the end, PC yells out that there is nobody present but two Macs having fun. * Virus‚ÄîBased on the American ad Viruses, it contains the dialogue \\"This one's a humdinger\\" instead of \\"a doozy\\" but otherwise contains no significant changes. Japanese campaign On December 12, 2006, Apple began to release ads in Japan that were similar in style to the US Get a Mac ads. The Mac and PC are played by the Rahmens, a Japanese comedy duo. The ads used to be viewable at Apple's Japan website. The following ads are exclusive to Japan: *Nengajo‚ÄîMac shows PC the New Year's Card he made using iPhoto. PC then looks at it, remarking about the picture of the wild boar on the card. *Nicknames‚ÄîPC is confused as to why Mac is not called a PC. Mac then explains that more people use him at home, and PC counters that he is more business- oriented. PC then asks for a nickname for himself; Mac then names him WƒÅku (work). *Practice Drawing‚ÄîPC says he can create pictures, but they are all graphs. For example, what Mac thinks is Manhattan is a bar graph and what Mac thinks is a mountain view is a line graph. Mac catches on, correctly identifying a pie chart, but PC responds that it is a pizza, chiding Mac for having no artistic sense. This is similar to Art Language, in that PC is trying to connect with artsy people like Mac. *Steps‚ÄîMac tells PC that he has made his own webpage using iWeb. PC then asks for the steps to make his own. Mac gives them, finishing after step three. PC then pesters Mac for step four, which Mac finally explains is to have a cup of coffee. Several American ads were modified for the Japanese market. In some of these ads, the events that occur in the narrative differ significantly from the original American campaign. Others follow the original ads more closely, with only minor differences (many based on the differences in characterization from the actors involved). The adapted ads are * Bloated‚ÄîThis ad is similar to Stuffed, but in this ad, PC makes no reference to bloatware (limited or useless versions of programs loaded onto new PCs), instead complaining about how much space installing a new operating system takes. Mac expresses his hopes that PC didn't have to delete any important data. * iLife‚ÄîThis ad is almost exactly the same as the American version, except that PC is listening to Eurobeat on his iPod rather than slow jams, and Mac gives a pregnant pause instead of complimenting PC on his pre-loaded calculator and clock. * iMovie‚ÄîThis ad with Miki Nakatani, is nearly identical to the American ad Better Results, except that PC actually thinks that his home movie is comparable to the Mac home movie. * Microsoft Office‚ÄîBased on the UK ad Office Posse, the ad contains only minor differences. At the end of the ad, PC tries to entice Office by chanting, \\"Overtime! Overtime! All together now!\\" * Pie Chart‚ÄîThis ad is based on the American ad Work vs. Home. The narrative is largely the same, with the only significant differences being that Mac is blogging rather than working with movies, music, and podcasts, and the names of the divisions of the pie chart each represent Sightseeing and Relaxing at a Caf√©. * Restart‚ÄîThis ad is identical to the American ad Restarting, except that PC doesn't restart again after Mac goes off to get IT. * Security‚ÄîThis ad is based on the American ad Trust Mac, but contains some significant changes. Rather than disguising himself to hide from viruses, PC dons protective gear to fight viruses. PC demands that any virus out there come and fight him. After Mac points out a virus, PC slowly moves behind Mac to protect himself. * Virus‚ÄîThe ad contains no significant changes from the American ad Viruses. Keynote videos While not strictly a part of the ad campaign, Hodgman and Long appeared in videos during Steve Jobs's keynote addresses at the 2006, 2007, and 2009 Worldwide Developers Conference and the 2008 MacWorld Expo. * WWDC 2006‚ÄîIn an attempt to stall Mac development, PC claims to have a message from Steve Jobs that says that the developers should take the rest of the year off, and that Microsoft could use some help with Vista. He starts to go off-topic about his vacation with Jobs, but when Mac arrives he says he's just preparing for their next commercial and starts to sing the Meow Mix theme song off-key. * WWDC 2007‚ÄîPC dresses up as Steve Jobs, and announces that he is quitting and shutting down Apple. He claims that Vista did so well, selling tens of dozens of copies, that there's no need for Leopard, and that he got his iPod-killer, a brown Zune. He tells the developers to just go home because they're no longer needed. Mac arrives and chides PC for trying to mislead the developers again like last year. He asks if PC really thinks the audience will believe he is Jobs. PC then claims he is Phil Schiller. * MacWorld Expo 2008‚ÄîPC and Mac stand under a Happy New Year sign, and PC talks about what a terrible year 2007 has been for him, referring to Windows Vista as a failure while Apple Inc. experienced success with Mac OS X Leopard, iPod Touch, and iPhone. Despite this, PC says he is optimistic for the future, claiming it to be the Year of the PC. When asked what his plans are for 2008, PC states he is \\"just going to copy everything [Mac] did in 2007.\\" * WWDC 2009‚ÄîPC comes out and greets the crowd and says that he wants them to have a great conference with \\"incredible innovations that will keep Apple at the forefront...\\" He stops, then says, \\"I think I can do that better.\\" Now it's take 2. He wishes them a \\"week with some innovation, but not a lot, please. Yeah, I like that.\\" Then he says some stuff about the 1 Billion App Countdown. He asks for apps and ideas. He says, \\"I hope you're thinking of some great ideas because I'm thinking of some great ideas too!...What are your ideas?\\" Eventually at Take 16, PC gives up and Mac tells everyone to have a great conference. Release dates (U.S. campaign) The different spots were released gradually: * The original set of Viruses, Restarting, Better, iLife, Network, WSJ, were launched on May 2, 2006. * Work vs. Home, Touch√©, and Out of the Box were released on June 12, 2006. * Accident, Angel/Devil and Trust Mac, were released for the campaign on August 27, 2006, during the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards. * In September, three new commercials made their debut on Canadian television, one (Better Results) features Gisele B√ºndchen alongside Hodgman and Long in an advertisement that had been sighted at certain Apple Stores.

Effectiveness Before the campaign's launch, Apple had seen lower sales in 2005‚Äì06. One month after the start of the \\"Get a Mac\\" campaign, Apple saw an increase of 200,000 Macs sold, and at the end of July 2006, Apple announced that it had sold 1.3 million Macs. Apple had an overall increase in sales of 39% for the fiscal year ending September 2006. Criticism In an article for Slate magazine, Seth Stevenson criticized the campaign as being too \\"mean spirited\\", suggesting, \\"isn't smug superiority (no matter how affable and casually dressed) a bit off-putting as a brand strategy?\\". In an article in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker points out that the use of the comedians Mitchell and Webb in the UK campaign is curious. They both star in the sitcom Peep Show in which, to quote the article's author, \\"Mitchell plays a repressed, neurotic underdog, and Webb plays a selfish, self-regarding poseur... So when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'\\" =Differentiating between a Mac and a PC= Many computer experts have argued over the definition of PC, or personal computer, which can raise questions about the actual differentiation between a Mac and a PC. Editor in Chief of PC Magazine, Lance Ulanoff states in a 2008 column in PC Magazine, \\"Of course, the ads would then be far less effective, because consumers might realize that the differences Apple is trying to tout aren't quite as huge as Apple would like you to believe.\\" = Projectory \\"Japanese Camera\\" advertisement = The commercial \\"Network\\" has been criticized as being projectory and blame shifting, because Apple is notorious for having proprietary systems (vendor lock-in), isolated from open standards (e.g. no support for Bluetooth file sharing, WiFi Direct, NFC file sharing; no USB charging connector on the iPhone, lack of modularity (no MicroSD-expandable storage in iPhones), historically poor support for codecs and file systems other than those developed by Apple themselves, etc.) and poor repairability (historically poor iFixit scores).TheVerge.com article (2018-10-04): ‚ÄúApple is using proprietary software to lock MacBook Pros and iMac Pros from third-party repairs‚Äù.ZDnet article (2010-01-28): ‚ÄúApple becomes more closed with each new device...‚ÄùTheVice.com article: Apple's New Proprietary Software Locks Will Kill Independent Repair on New MacBook ProsCIO.com article (2016-06-27): ‚ÄúDoes Apple's ecosystem lock in users?‚Äù I'm a PC Microsoft responded to the Get a Mac advertising campaign in late 2008 by releasing the I'm a PC campaign, featuring Microsoft employee Sean Siler as a John Hodgman look-alike. While Apple's ads show personifications of both Mac and PC systems, the Microsoft ads show PC users instead proudly defining themselves as PCs. In popular culture * Videos parodying the Get a Mac campaign have been published online by Novell, to promote Linux, represented by a young and fashionable woman. A different set of videos parodying the campaign have been produced, but with Linux portrayed as a typical male nerd. * To promote Steam on Mac, Valve made a parody with Portal and Team Fortress 2 sentry guns. * After the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike, the cast and crew of the American television show Numb3rs decided to parody the \\"Get a Mac\\" commercials to promote the return of the show on Friday, April 4, 2008. In the ad, brothers Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) debate the merits of being a FBI agent versus being a mathematician.

Used on the Enfield branch of the ECR, but also employed on occasions as a locomotive on the main line ‚Äì note the raised buffers for use with other rolling stock. William Bridges Adams (1797 ‚Äì 23 July 1872) was an English author, inventor and locomotive engineer. He is best known for his patented Adams axle ‚Äî a successful radial axle design in use on railways in Britain until the end of steam traction in 1968 ‚Äî and the railway fishplate. His writings, including English Pleasure Carriages (1837) and Roads and Rails (1862) covered all forms of land transport. Later he became a noted writer on political reform, under the pen name Junius Redivivus (Junius reborn); a reference to a political letter writer of the previous century. Personal life He was born and grew up in Woore, Shropshire, close to Madeley, Staffordshire and was educated at the Madeley School. His father was a son of a yeoman farmer of Woore, who moved to London where he worked his way from a journeyman to master. His principal business was that of supplying leather to coachmakers from a shop in Dean Street, Soho. In due course Adams was apprenticed to the coach making firm of Baxter & Pierce of Long Acre, London. This was a well known firm and during his time with the company Napoleon's travelling carriage was brought there, after the battle of Waterloo, and Bridges Adams made a drawing of it. In December 1819 he married Elizabeth Place, the daughter of Francis Place, the social reformer. Together they set out on a voyage to find their fortunes in a warmer climate. In 1820 they left for Valparaiso in Chile. In Valparaiso he was employed to manage Lord Cochrane's estate, for a salary of ¬£200 per year. In 1821 he had a son, William Alexander Adams (de), later to become a mechanical engineer in his own right. The family survived the earthquake in Valparaiso of 19 November 1822. Elizabeth died on 8 August 1823, when giving birth to a second child, who also died. Following this tragedy Bridges Adams returned to England, with his son, by a long trek over the Andes to Buenos Aires and by ship back to London, via Falmouth, in 1826. After a further trip to the United States, Bridges Adams settled in London and took a position in the firm of Hobson & Co, Coachmakers. =Marriages= Adams was married three times. His first wife was Elizabeth Place. He married Sarah Fuller Flower Adams in 1834 and they resided at the now demolished Sunnybank, Woodbury Hill, in Loughton, where there is a blue plaque to the couple jointly. After Sarah's death in 1848, he remarried to Ellen Kendall, with whom he would have one daughter, Hope Bridges Adams. =Later life= Adams died at Cuthbert House, Broadstairs, Kent, aged seventy-five, and was buried at St Peter's Church in the town. Railway engineering Adams's fishplate Bridges Adams patented an improved carriage spring, which he called \\"bow springs\\". These could also be used on railway carriages, and the manufacture proved profitable. The manufacture was based in the Currier Factory in Drury Lane and Parker Street, Soho. The business was carried out in the name of Samuel Adams, Bridges Adams's uncle. In 1842 the factory moved from its small premises to three acres of land adjoining the Eastern Counties Railway at Fair Field, Bow. The company now traded as Adams & Co. He founded the Fairfield Locomotive Works () in Bow, East London, in 1843, where he specialized in light engines, steam railcars (or railmotors) and inspection trolleys. These were sold in small numbers to railways all over Britain and Ireland, including the Fairfield steam carriage for the broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway and the Enfield for his most important customer, the Eastern Counties Railway, with its headquarters at nearby Stratford. He supplied a 2-2-0 well tank to the Roman Railway.Hamilton Ellis, The pictorial history of railways, Hamlyn, 1968, p.58. Dissatisfied with the scarf joints then in use for joining iron track, he invented the first railway fishplate, in the form of an unbolted wedge between adjoining chairs, in collaboration with Robert Richardson, a junior engineer under Peter Bruff on the Eastern Counties Railway. The two men patented the invention in 1847. Although the design was successful, with sales to the Eastern Counties Railway among others, financial difficulties forced Adams to relinquish the patent.Manby (1857: 289) This \\"wedge\\" version was soon overtaken by an improved, bolted design by James Samuel of the Eastern Counties Railway.Manby (1857: 234) Although Adams‚Äôs inventions and writings became well-known, the locomotives he produced made little impact. The engineering business failed some years later, although by this time Adams had expanded his interests to include clothing design and journalism. Confusion with William Adams Confusingly, one of the first railway companies to use his axle-box design widely was the London and South Western Railway where the Locomotive Superintendent, the creator of the Adams Bogie, was also named William Adams. By further coincidence he too had formerly operated a locomotive works in Bow, but this was not a private concern but the depot of the North London Railway. In 1865 the Society of Engineers, London, made direct comparison between the bogie with the india-rubber lateral bearing of William Adams and the radial axle box of William Bridges Adams: during trials on the North London Railway the laterally sprung bogie was thought superior to the radial axle, but when William Adams moved to the LSWR he adopted the axle box designed by his rival Bridges Adams. The locomotives now known as Adams Radials are named after the Locomotive Superintendent, but they are famous for the axle invented by William Bridges Adams.

It covers 1.518 square kilometers (375.1 acres) and has a peak of 285 meters (935 ft) above sea level. It is renowned for its numerous Buddha images which have been carved out of the hill's rock faces or free-standing structures erect since the times of the Sui Dynasty (581-618) and its Xingguochan Temple. It is considered as one of the \\"Three Greatest Attractions in Jinan\\" together with Baotu Spring and Daming Lake. It is also one of the 4A-rated Tourist attractions in China. Thousand Buddha Mountain is opened up as a public park in 1959, rated as AAAA-rated Tourist Attractions of China in 2005, and rated as National Park of China in March 2017. Legend According to local tradition, the legendary Emperor Shun was credited to open up land and cultivate under the mountain. Thus, the Thousand Buddha Mountain is also known as the Shungeng Hill (meaning the hill where Shun cultivated). According to a legend related in the Youyang Zazu (Youyang Miscellanies) by the Tang Dynasty writer Duan Chengshi (800-863), the Thousand Buddha Mountain was originally located by the sea and the sea god had locked it in place there by a large lock in order to prevent the god in charge of the mountains from moving it around. However, eventually the lock broke and the mountain was hurled through the air into its present position. An artwork shaped as a large lock and a piece of chain has been placed on the summit of the mountain as a reference to the legend. History Buddha statues in a cliff south of the Xingguochan Temple Buddhism became popular in the Jinan area during the reign of Emperor Wen, the founder of the Sui Dynasty. With Buddhism, monks came to area and chiseled Buddha statues out of the flanks of the hill, which was originally called Miji Hill or Li Hill. A temple, called the Thousand Buddha Temple (Qianfosi), was founded at the foot of the hill. Eventually, the hill was renamed after the temple into \\"Thousand Buddha Mountain\\". One of the old names, Li Hill (Li Shan), survives in the name of Lishan Road, the major avenue which runs through Jinan towards the Thousand Buddha Mountain in north- south direction.  Main Attractions  The Thousand Buddha Mountain Public Park has been developed extensively for‚Äîmostly local tourism‚Äîby the creation of access roads and walking paths as well the addition of amusement park features such as a 600 meter-long chairlift, a summer slide (the \\"Shun'neng Slide\\") down the hill, a kart racing track, and numerous souvenir stalls. The major attractions mostly have significant meanings to the spread of Buddhism. = Thousand Buddha Cliff = The Thousand-Buddha Cliff is located on the northern flank of the hill behind the Xingguochan Temple. The foot of the cliff is pierced by four caves, which are named (from west to east): Longquan (meaning Dragon Spring) Cave, Jile (meaning Extremely Happy) Cave, Qianlou Cave, and Luzu Cave. The caves' height ranges from 3 meters down to only 20 centimeters. About 130 Buddha statues which were carved into Thousand-Buddha Cliff during the Sui period remain today, which can trace back for over 1400 years. = Xingguochan Temple = Buddha statues in a cave south of the Xingguochan Temple Along with the Buddha statues, temples and other buildings were erected on the hill. The most renowned of these structures is the Xingguochan Temple (, literally: \\"Development of the Country Buddhist Temple\\") which was originally built during the reign of Emperor Taizhong of Tang as an expansion of the Sui-Dynasty Qianfo Temple. Further enlargements were undertaken during the Song Dynasty, but the temple was destroyed by war afterwards. Rebuilding was undertaken in 1468, during the Ming Dynasty. The Guanying Hall, the Foye Hall, and the Thousand-Hands Buddha statue were added during the Qing Dynasty. The temple is located about halfway up the hill and can be reached via 300 stone steps. A large inscription (total area about 15 square meters) cut into the cliff face to the southwest of the identifies it as the \\"Number One Temple\\" (Di Yi Mi Hua). The temple's courtyards feature several stone tablets bearing inscriptions from renowned calligraphers. In one of the temple's courtyards stands a sculpture of the legendary Emperor Shun, who is‚Äîaccording to the local tradition‚Äîcredited with first ploughing the soil in Jinan as well as with inventing the writing brush. Because of its mythological association with Emperor Shun, the Thousand Buddha hill is also known as Shungeng Hill. The main structure of the temple are: Grand Prayer Hall, Guanying Hall, Dharma Hall, Maitreya Hall, and the Buddhist Scripture building. Lishanyuan courtyard, to the east of the temple, is surrounded by sites of worship belonging to Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The names of these buildings are: the Shun and the Luban Ancestral Temples, the Wenchang (\\"Develop the Culture\\") Cabinet, and the Yilan Kiosk. The temple has been the site of two annual temple fairs held on the 3rd day of the third month and 9th day of the 9th month of the Chinese Lunar Calendar since the times of the Yuan Dynasty. It was burned down in wars and rebuild during the Ming Dynasty. Other notable buildings on the hill are: the Pagoda Tree Pavilion (Tang Dynasty), Cloud Passing Zen Temple, and the Tanghuai Kiosk.East gate of Xingguochan TempleMany of the statues on the Thousand Buddha Mountain were damaged or lost during the Cultural Revolution, but restoration started in 1979 already. Since then, many new statues have been added. The largest new statues are a 20 meter-tall sitting Maitreya Buddha completed in 2000 and lying Buddha with a swastika on his chest. The latter statue was carved out of granite in 1996, has a length of 10 meters and weighs approximately 50 tonnes. = Myriad Buddha Cave = Maitreya Statue A major tourist attraction is the Myriad Buddha Cave (Wanfo Dong) at the foot of the hill's northern slope. Inside the more than 500 meter-long artificial cave, late-20th-century recreations of Buddhist statues from four famous Chinese grottoes (Dunhuang and Maiji Shan in Gansu Province, Longmen in Henan Province, Yun Gang in Shanxi Province) are on display. The original artworks were created during the Northern Wei, Tang, and Song dynasties. According to the operators (information provided on the backside of the entrance ticket as of 2006), around 28 000 Buddhist images are on display inside the cave, the biggest statue‚Äîa lying Buddha‚Äîis 28 meters long. = Maitreya Garden = Located in the east part of the mountain, the Maitreya Garden was built in 2000 with Japanese Corporate Myokoen as a China- Japan Friendship Garden. The garden covers 30 thousand square meters, including the Maitreya statue, Sakura garden, and some other affiliated structures, which is a blend of Chinese and Japanese styles of garden architecture. The whole statue has a height of 30 meters, thus it is known as \\"the number one largest Buddha north of Yangze River.\\" The information about Maitreya is carved behind the statue on an annular rock face. The carvings are 36 meters long and 3.5 meters high, covering 126 square meters.  Annual Events  Qianfoshan Spring Festival Temple Fair = Lunar New Year Praying Temple Fair = As one of the most important festivals of the year, Lunar New Year is the time for Chinese people to pray for good luck for the upcoming year. Every year during Spring Festival, thousands of people visit the Xingguochan Temple to burn incense and pray for their loved ones and for a peaceful year. There is also the temple fair for tourists to feel in flavor of the Spring Festival with folk performances and artifacts. Tanghulu Booth at Qianfoshan Miaohui = Qixi Festival Blind Dates = During the week of Qixi Festival, the Chinese Valentine's Day, the park holds blind dates for single men and women from Jinan and other places. Mainly in their twenties or thirties, participants post their information onto the board while searching for ones they have interests in. Parents who wish their children to get married also go up the hill to find a date for their children. By 2019, the event had been held for 13 times. = Double Ninth Festival Temple Fair = The Double Ninth Festival is a traditional Chinese festival on the ninth day of the ninth month in Lunar Calendar. While it is customary to climbing a high mountain, Thousand Buddha Mountain Scenic Spot holds annual temple fair around that time of the year. Exhibition includes artistic performance, folk handicrafts and local souvenirs, agricultural products, and traditional food and snacks. On the date of the festival in 2019, the total number of tourists reached over 62,000. Location Northern slope of the hill The Thousand Buddha Mountain Public Park is flanked by a cemetery honoring the fallen of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 on the east side, the former site of Shandong Provincial Museum to the northeast, and the Jinan Botanical Garden on the west side.

Jimmy is arrested. Pussy slips out, but is intercepted by a policeman moments later. He is released on bail soon after. Vin Makazian tells Tony that he has heard from a good source that Pussy is an FBI informant. Tony is reluctant to believe it, but Vin points out how easily Pussy managed to get off from the raid. He further explains that Pussy's alternative was long imprisonment for selling heroin, and as a man who cares deeply for his family he was easy to turn. Tony insists on seeing the official report with Pussy's name on it, but Vin cannot obtain it. Pussy has stopped collecting payments because of back pain but Paulie, who sees the same doctor, has been told there is nothing wrong with Pussy's back ‚Äì though the doctor adds that \\"no one knows anything about backs.\\" Tony asks Dr. Melfi's opinion; back pain, she says, might be caused by stress, such as the burden of a secret. Tony tells Paulie not to act until Pussy's wire is seen, so Paulie insists that Pussy go to a bathhouse with him; Pussy refuses to undress, saying that his doctor told him that heat is bad for him. Silvio discovers that Vin owes Pussy $30,000, which he believes may be his motive to have Pussy \\"disappear.\\" Tony visits Pussy at his home and questions him sympathetically. \\"You got anything you want to say to me?\\" he asks to no response. Tony is distrustful and confused; he tells Silvio he feels he is walking into walls. Vin has a fond personal relationship with the madam of a bordello, and he is there when the police raid it; soon after, Vin commits suicide by jumping off a bridge. Jimmy is bailed out and visits Tony at his home. Tony is surprised that he was freed so soon. He asks Tony some intrusive questions about the cash stolen from the Colombian drug dealer. This prompts Tony to suspect that Jimmy is in fact the rat; he and Pussy were arrested at the same time, and Vin's source mixed up the \\"two fat fucks with black hair.\\" Pussy is no longer suspected, but he has disappeared. Junior visits Livia. She is bitter that Tony has sold her house. She tells Junior that several capos have placed their mothers at Green Grove, and they hold meetings there. Junior instantly suspects that they are conspiring against him with Tony and decides that he has to act against him. He assigns Mikey and Chucky to find hitmen from out of town.

The son of a clergyman, Simojoki was born on 28 January 1899 in Rautio.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 359 As a youth he saw service in the struggle for Finnish independence and then with the Forest Guerrillas in East Karelia. A student in theology at the University of Helsinki, he became involved in the formation of Academic Karelia Society, serving as chairman from 1922-3 and secretary from 1923-4. He advocated the union of all Finnish people into a Greater Finland whilst in this post. Strongly influenced by Russophobia, the student Simojoki addressed a rally on 'Kalevala Day' in 1923 with the slogan \\"In the name of Finland's lost honour and her coming greatness, death to the Ruskis.\\"Christopher S. Browning, Constructivism, Narrative and Foreign Policy Analysis: A Case Study of Finland, Peter Lang, 2008, p. 129 Simojoki was ordained as a minister in 1925 and he held the chaplaincy at Kiuruvesi from 1929 until his death. He became involved with the Patriotic People's Movement and, in 1933, took command of their youth movement, Sinimustat (The Blue-and- Blacks), which looked for inspiration to similar movements amongst fascist parties in Germany and Italy. The movement was banned in 1936 due to its involvement in revolutionary activity in Estonia, although Simojoki continued to serve as a leading member of the Patriotic People's Movement. He was a Member of Parliament in 1933-1939. He founded a second youth group, Mustapaidat (the Black Shirts), in 1937, although this proved less successful. When the Winter War broke out in 1939 Simojoki enlisted as a chaplain in the Finnish Army. He was killed in action on Koirinoja's ice in Impilahti, while putting down a wounded horse in no man's land.

Example was originally built for the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, and was transferred to the Royal Navy when the RNXS disbanded in 1994. On transfer, she retained her name, and became the first ship in the Royal Navy to bear that name. HMS Example is currently part of the Coastal Forces Squadron, formerly 1st Patrol Boat Squadron. The mission statement of the CFS is to \\"provide support to allow the conduct of safe and effective P2000 operations in support of the URNU sea-training syllabus\\". Example is attached to the Northumbrian URNU, is based at the shore establishment HMS Calliope in Gateshead, and has a crew of 5 (plus up to 12 students). Example acts as a training ship for students at Durham, Newcastle, Northumbria, Teesside and Sunderland universities. The ship takes part in deployments over the university summer and Easter holidays, giving the students an opportunity to spend a longer amount of time living on board the ship and to experience larger scale naval operations with other URNUs. Operational history Example was built by Watercraft Ltd of Shoreham by Sea and launched in 1985. She was initially delivered to the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service (RNXS) as an auxiliary service vessel with the pennant number A153. She was the lead vessel of a batch of four vessels known as the Example class, but was identical in design to the Archer class of patrol boats being simultaneously built for the Royal Navy. Example and her sisters were transferred to the Royal Navy when the RNXS disbanded in 1994. She retained her existing name, but was reclassified as a patrol boat of the Archer class, and was given the new pennant number of P165. The ship played a prominent role in the 2004 Entente Cordiale celebrations, and escorted in the 2005 International Fleet Review. In summer 2006 the ship celebrated its 21st birthday with divisions at HMS Calliope with the salute taken by N Sherlock, Lord Lieutenant of Tyne and Wear.

He was the father of Kazimierz Staszewski and the author of many songs and ballads, sung both by his son and by Jacek Kaczmarski. Biography Stanis≈Çaw Staszewski was born December 18, 1925 in Pabianice to an impoverished szlachta family of a gymnasium headmaster. During World War II young Stanis≈Çaw was a member of the Armia Krajowa. In its ranks he took part in the failed episode of the Warsaw Uprising in the borough of Praga. Taken prisoner by the Germans he faced the risk of being executed and instead managed to convince the German soldiers of his German ancestry and willingness to join the Wehrmacht. Along with several of his colleagues he was allowed to join the German army - and defected the following day. However, he was again caught by the Germans and sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. There, in March 1945, he narrowly escaped death when he became a Muselmann and was placed on a pile of corpses bound for cremation. However, he was discovered by the inmates running the camp and managed to survive until liberation. After the war Staszewski returned to Warsaw, where he graduated from the faculty of architecture of the Warsaw University of Technology. He also became an active member of various student cultural societies. About that time he also wrote some of his first songs and poems. In 1961 he moved to P≈Çock, where he became the city's chief architect. Although initially a communist and a member of the Polish United Workers' Party, Staszewski's poems were found dangerous by the party's authorities and he was expelled from it. In 1967, through Hungary, Staszewski with his wife emigrated to Paris and then to Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he wrote the majority of his poems. He also recorded some of them as bootleg songs on a tape recorder. He died January 22, 1973 in Paris and was buried at Warsaw's Br√≥dno Cemetery. Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Staszewski's songs became popular in late 1970s and 1980s thanks to Jacek Kaczmarski, who performed a number of them during his concerts. In 1990s Staszewski's son, Kazik with his rock band Kult published two records (Tata Kazika and Tata 2) with his father's songs in new arrangements which achieved legendary status since.

It ran for two series, the first debuting on BBC Two in 2000 and the second airing on BBC Choice the following year. Developed by Raindog, the series was created by Robbie Allen, Stuart Davids and Martin McCardie. Set throughout the city of Glasgow, Scotland, it deals with the lifestyles of eight main characters who each have the titular Tinsel Town nightclub in common. In Series One, six episodes were written by Martin McCardie, two by Ed McCardie and two by Dublin playwright, Jimmy Murphy. In the second series, the Tinsel Town name has extended to feature a clothing retail store in addition to the nightclub. Produced and broadcast in the wake of 1999's controversial TV drama Queer as Folk, and promoted as a \\"Scottish version\\" of that series, Tinsel Town was defined by its broadcaster as \\"a cutting-edge saga of life and love in Glasgow club land\\". In its debut year the series was nominated for four BAFTA Scotland New Talent Awards: Best Television Performance nominations for Dawn Steele and Kate Dickie, and wins for Best Producer, Robbie Allen and Best Television Director for actress turned director Caroline Paterson. The series was also nominated for two UK BAFTAs in the category of Best New Writer. Brothers Ed and Martin McCardie were nominated against each other for the award, with Ed winning UK BAFTA Best New Writer of 2000. The characters include Stevie Allen as 37-year-old policeman Lewis Reid, and David Paisley as his 17-year-old boyfriend Ryan Taylor. Ryan's sister Sandra (Mandy Matthews) is also a central character with her friendship with Jack Donnelly (Paul Thomas Hickey) providing humour and balance to the cast. Other central cast members were Dawn Steele as Teresa, Steven Duffy as Brady, Stuart Sinclair Blythe as Coutts and Kate Dickie as Lex. In Series 1, Brady embarks on a sordid affair with Coutts‚Äôs girlfriend Teresa, resulting in the end of series cliffhanger. New club DJ Lex (Dickie) is introduced at the start of the series and we see her battling to escape her sadistic ex-husband with the help of the club owner, transvestite Stella (Jim Twaddale). Series Two saw the transmission times reduced to 30 minutes, with all ten episodes being written by co-creator, Martin McCardie. The loss of Brady and Coutts who were central to the plot and cliffhanger of series 1, changed the emphasis of the second series. The series aired again on BBC Choice in 2001 and then BBC Two in 2002. The first series was released on VHS, but neither has been repeated by the BBC since. Rights to both series were acquired by Rapture TV, who are at least theoretically Scottish-owned, and began airing in May 2006. This is one of the first times that a BBC series has been sold to a free-to-air broadcaster, or been shown FTA other than on the BBC itself. The shows effective \\"theme song\\" is \\"Out of Control\\" by the Chemical Brothers and Bernard Sumner, which plays through the majority of in- club sequences as well as other times in the show.

Parecoxib is a COX2 selective inhibitor. It is injectable. It is approved through much of Europe for short term perioperative pain control. It was patented in 1996 and approved for medical use in 2002. Approval In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a letter of non-approval for parecoxib in the United States. No reasons were ever documented publicly for the non-approval, although one study noted increased occurrences of heart attacks following cardiac bypass surgery compared to placebo when high doses of parecoxib were used to control pain after surgery. It is also important to remember that rare but severe allergic reactions (Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, Lyell syndrome) have been described with valdecoxib, the molecule to which parecoxib is converted.Health The drug is not approved for use after cardiac surgery in Europe. All anti-inflammatory medications in the U.S. carry the same warning regarding skin reactions, and none are approved for use during CABG surgery, so the reason for the FDA denying the approval of parecoxib remains unknown, but was likely related to political pressure from the US Congress to not approve another COX-2 selective inhibitor in the wake of the Vioxx affair. No COX-2 selective inhibitor has been approved in the US since that time, regardless of the safety profile of parecoxib in Europe. Efforts to find out the scientific rationale, or more likely the lack thereof, that the FDA used to justify the non-approval of parecoxib in the USA have proven futile due to secrecy issues. The political motivation to not approve parecoxib was further supported by a 2017 pooled analysis of safety data in 28 published studies, which showed after 69,567,300 units of parecoxib, skin rash and cardiac complications were minimal, if at all, different from placebo. Parecoxib, along with other COX-2 selective inhibitors, celecoxib, valdecoxib, and mavacoxib, were discovered by a team at the Searle division of Monsanto led by John Talley.

It is the church of the parish of San Sebastian. Completed in 1891, San Sebastian Church is noted for its architecture. An example of the Gothic Revival architecture in the Philippines, it is the only steel building church in the Philippines.Layug, p. 88. \\"The basilica is the first and the only all-steel church in Asia, the second in the world after the Eiffel Tower of Paris (French engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel himself is also rumored BUT NEVER CONFIRMED to have been involved in the basilica's construction) \\" It was designated as a National Historical Landmark in 1973Layug, p. 88 and as a National Cultural Treasure in 2011. San Sebastian Church is under the care of the Order of Augustinian Recollects, who also operate the San Sebastian College adjacent to the basilica. It is located at Plaza del Carmen, at the eastern end of Recto Avenue, in Quiapo, Manila.Layug, p. 87 History The San Sebastian Basilica under construction in 1890. In 1621, Bernardino Castillo, a generous patron and a devotee of the 3rd-century Roman martyr Saint Sebastian, donated the land upon which the church stands. The original structure, made of wood, burned in 1651 during a Chinese Filipino uprising. Succeeding structures, which were built of brick, were destroyed by fire and earthquakes in 1859, 1863, and 1880. In the 1880s, Esteban Mart√≠nez, the parish priest of the ruined church, approached Spanish Architect Genaro Palacios to build a church that will withstand the earthquakes. Palacios planned to build a fire and earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel. He completed a design that fused Earthquake Baroque with the Neo-Gothic style. His final design was said to have been inspired by the famed Gothic Burgos Cathedral in Burgos, Spain. =Construction (1888-1891)= The prefabricated steel sections that would compose the church were manufactured in Binche, Belgium. According to historian Ambeth Ocampo, the knockdown steel parts were ordered from the Societe anonyme des Enterprises de Travaux Publiques in Brussels. In all, of prefabricated steel sections were transported in eight separate shipments from Belgium to the Philippines, the first shipment arriving in 1888. Belgian engineers supervised the assembly of the church, the first column of which was erected on September 11, 1890.Layug, pp. 87‚Äì88 The walls were filled with mixed sand, gravel, and cement. The stained glass windows were imported from the Heinrich Oidtmann Company, a German stained glass firm, while local artisans assisted in applying the finishing touches. The church was raised to the status of a minor basilica by Pope Leo XIII on June 24, 1890. Upon its completion the following year, on August 16, 1891, the Bas√≠lica Menor de San Sebasti√°n was consecrated by Bernardino Nozaleda y Villa OP, the 25th Archbishop of Manila. According to Jes√∫s Pastor Paloma, an Augustinian Recollect priest, the structure was also supposed to have a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm. A wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma also noted that the bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake. =Restoration (2011-present)= Restoration works began in 2011. Features The Finding in the Temple stained glass window manufactured in Germany by the Heinrich Oidtmann Company. San Sebastian Church has two openwork towers and steel vaulting. From its floor, the basilica's nave rises to the dome, and to the tip of the twin spires. The faux finished interior of the church incorporates groined vaults in the Gothic architecture style permitting very ample illumination from lateral windows. The steel columns, walls and ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Rocha, Isabelo Tampingco and F√©lix Mart√≠nez to give the appearance of marble and jasper. Trompe l'oeil paintings of saints and martyrs by Rocha were used to decorate the interiors of the church. True to the Gothic revival spirit of the church are its confessionals, pulpit, altars and five retablos designed by Lorenzo Guerrero and Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women.Layug, pp. 88‚Äì89. Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from Romblon. Above the main altar is an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, given to the church by Carmelite sisters from Mexico City in 1617. The image withstood all the earthquakes and fires which had destroyed previous incarnations of San Sebastian Church, but its ivory head was stolen in 1975. Cultural and historical declarations San Sebastian Church was declared a National Historical Landmark by President Ferdinand Marcos through Presidential Decree No. 260 on August 1, 1973. Subsequently, the church was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines on August 15, 2011, with the unveiling of the marker on January 20, 2012. On May 16, 2006, San Sebastian Church was included by the National Historical Institute (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) in the Philippines' Tentative List for possible designation as a World Heritage Site, on account of its architectural and historical heritage. the church is no longer included in the Tentative List.  Preservation  In recent years, San Sebastian Church has encountered threats to its structural integrity. The steel structure has been beset by rust and corrosion due to sea breezes from nearby Manila Bay. State funding was accorded to the church through the National Historical Institute which undertook restoration in 1982. The Recollect community has likewise expended funds for the church's maintenance and restoration. In 1998, it was placed on the biennial watchlist of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund, though it was not retained in the subsequent watchlists. The church was listed again as one of the most endangered monuments in the world by World Monuments Fund in the 2010 World Monuments Watch, along with the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras and Santa Maria Church. All of the sites were taken off the list in 2011 after the passage of the National Cultural Heritage Act.https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily- inquirer/20091109/284082022674268  UNESCO re-inclusion troubled  On October 1, 2018, it was revealed that a thirty one-storey residential highrise building of Summithome Realty Corporation is being planned to be constructed beside the historic San Sebastian Church, negatively affecting the site's possible re-inclusion in the UNESCO tentative list as the area around the church is integral to the site as a 'buffer zone'. The site, the first and only all-steel church in Asia, used to be in the UNESCO tentative list but was removed in 2015 due to structural decay. To re-establish the site's integrity and re-inclusion in the tentative list, it underwent a massive restoration program, which conservationists have cited as a megalithic success. However, with the looming threat of the high-rise building, the site's inclusion in the UNESCO list is bleak. Summithome was able to acquire a barangay clearance supporting their application for a building permit from the barangay chairman, without the site managers being initially informed. Alleged involvement of Gustave Eiffel It has long been reputed that Gustave Eiffel, the French engineer behind the Eiffel Tower and the steel structure within the Statue of Liberty, was involved in the design and construction of San Sebasti√°n, but this was never confirmed. However, it was confirmed later on that Eiffel was involved in designing and supplying the metal framework for San Ignacio Church in Intramuros, thus confirming the contribution of Eiffel in Philippine church architecture, if not in San Sebastian Church.

The station is currently owned by Michael Crute, through licensee New WRRD, LLC. WRRD has an FM translator W269DL (101.7 MHz), which transmits from the WITI TV Tower in Shorewood, and currently rebroadcasts the national sports talk programming of ESPN Radio affiliate WAUK (540). History The 1510 AM frequency originally signed on as WAUX and later was the original home of the WAUK call sign until February 12, 2008. They had been a sports talk station since October 1994 and the previous home of ESPN Radio. Prior to sports the station had a smorgasbord of formats, including variations of adult contemporary, country music, and talk. WAUK was also the original sister station of Waukesha-licensed WMIL-FM (106.1), which launched as WAUX-FM and later became WAUK-FM before a sale to another party in the late 1970s. WRRD is limited to operating between sunrise and sunset, as WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee is classed as a clear-channel station. As a result, the station leased time from WMCS to carry the full ESPN Radio schedule between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. for several years. That arrangement ended after Good Karma Broadcasting moved the WAUK sports format to its new, full-time frequency of 540 kHz, the former home of Salem Broadcasting religious outlet WRRD. The WRRD calls then migrated to the 1510 kHz frequency. On May 2, 2008, WRRD switched from English-language sports radio to be an affiliate of ESPN Deportes, a new Spanish-language sports talk and play-by-play network. On January 31, 2017, The Devil's Advocates Radio (Devil's Advocates Radio Network Wisconsin) announced plans to purchase WRRD and to change the format to progressive talk, branded as \\"News Talk 1510\\" and as \\"WRRD Resistance Radio\\". The format change was implemented February 1 of that year.Madison Host to Purchase Milwaukee AM, Flip to Liberal Talk Radioinsight - January 27, 2017Can Liberal Talk Survive In Trump‚Äôs America? Radio Ink, January 31, 2017. Good Karma Broadcasting sold WRRD to New WRRD, LLC effective June 1, 2017 for $760,000. According to www.stationsale.com, WRRD is currently for sale, as of July 2018.https://stationsale.com/wrrd-translator-cp-w269dl-milwaukee-wisconsin/ On November 13, 2019, WRRD rebranded as \\"Talk 101.7\\" with the sign-on of W269DL 101.7 FM, which also allows the station to carry a full-day schedule, even after sunset. WRRD applied for a downgrade to 250 watts non-directional on August 19, 2020, shortly after putting the dormant Waukesha studio facility and transmitter site up for sale. The station dropped most local programming in August 2020, resulting in a near-simulcast of sister station WTTN. New Milwaukee Signs On with Liberal Talk On August 31, 2020, WRRD reverted to sports as a simulcast of former sister station WAUK, and the station's social media presence referred listeners to WTTN and its streaming presences with the shuttering of Crute's main studio facility on Brady Street in Milwaukee. On September 4, Good Karma Brands announced the acquisition of the W269DL translator, along with the re-acquisition of WRRD as former owner Michael Crute negotiated with Good Karma to trade the stations, while strengthening its Madison presence. The two stations are not connected together and Good Karma is free to wind down WRRD if it sees fit; as it is an individual translator not under the rules of translators given to AM stations solely to transmit their signal as part of the FCC's AM revitalization plan, it is free to be sold off without a connection to WRRD. On September 29, 2020, Good Karma announced that WRRD would become a talk radio station focused on the city's Black community, which will launch by the end of 2020 and be branded as \\"101.7 The Truth\\", with W269DL continuing to utilize 1510 as a signal source. It would be the first full-time Black talk station in the market in seven years, after WNOV converted to a music-heavy format under new ownership, while former network-share partner WMCS (now WZTI) converted to suburban-focused oldies formats after acquiring an FM translator. The station is also meant as a local response to iHeartMedia's Black Information Network, which despite that company's six local stations, has not yet launched in Milwaukee, even on an HD Radio subchannel.

The car was launched on 6 October 1992, at the Paris Motor Show. It was given the project code name 'Tomcat' in its 2 litre turbo powered version when in development. When introduced, the range flagship, the 220 Turbo Coup√©, was the most powerful and fastest production Rover model ever built. The range was revised in 1996, with new engines, and was renamed Rover Coup√©. Production ceased in 1998. Styling The Rover 200 Coup√© was equipped with a specially shaped split glass roof system with a central T-Bar. The twin panels could be tilted or detached independently, and the bar itself could also be removed and stored in the boot in a special protective cover. The glass was an advanced, semi reflective material, coated with titanium. Transmission of solar heat was restricted to only six per cent, eliminating the need for a sun blind. The lines of the 200 Coup√© resulted from a completely new monoside and front and rear roof panels, new front and rear bumpers and a deep front spoiler extension with large intake grille. Early style interior The interior was designed to accommodate four people, with rear seats individually styled. With the application of burr walnut veneer and quality fabrics, the interior was in the Rover traditions of elegance and refinement. Optional leather trim was also available. The Rover 200 Coup√© featured infra red remote central door locking as standard. It also saw the application of ultrasonic alarm system developed originally for the Rover 800 range, giving both perimetric and volumetric protection. Rover 200 Coup√© (1992‚Äì1995) A specially developed version of the established 'Torsen' torque sensing traction control system previously only applied to four wheel drive and some rear wheel drive vehicles (Maserati Biturbo), was developed to help optimise handling. It was standard on the 220 Turbo Coup√©, and optional for the first year of production on the naturally aspirated 220 version. Critics at the time reported that the handling was marred by the power being rather clumsily transmitted through the front wheels. As a result, the handling dynamics fell short of its rivals. At launch, three engine types gave the Coup√© a broad appeal: a Honda D-Series 1.6-litre engine , and two Rover 2.0 T-Series engines; a naturally aspirated version producing and a turbo version . All versions had manual transmission as standard, with an automatic option only with the 1.6 version. In 1994, changes were introduced to the 200 Coup√© range, most obviously with a chrome grille being added to bring in line with the rest of the 200 series. Cost saving changes were also seen, such as a reduction in the amount of leather used, ignition barrel light removed and dash light dimming deleted. The alarm system received several changes to keep up with current security requirements. Ash Grey was the standard trim colour on all derivatives, but the optional full leather trim set could be specified in either Ash Grey or Sand Stone Beige. Exterior colours initially were: White Diamond, Flame Red, Black, Quicksilver Metallic, Nordic Blue Metallic, Polynesian Turquoise Metallic, Nightfire Red Pearlescent and Tahiti Blue Pearlescent (a new colour exclusive to the Coup√©, later introduced to other cars in the Rover range). In 1994, Nordic Blue and Quicksilver were replaced with British Racing Green, Platinum Silver and Charcoal. Black, pearlescent or metallic paint were optional on all models. =216 Coup√©= '94 216 Coupe in British Racing Green The 1.6-litre model was designed to appeal to the cost conscious Coup√© buyer. Priced at ¬£14,495, the version achieved a 0 to 60 mph time of 9.5 seconds and a maximum speed of . Excessive stock of the 216 Coup√© led Rover to bring out a new model, the 216 SE, prior to the new 1996 range was launched. This was dressed up with the rear body coloured spoiler and front fog lamps, aimed to generate additional sales to clear the way for the new models. *Positive centre feel power steering *Ventilated front disc brakes *15\\" 7 spoke alloy road wheels with 185/55 VR tyres *Locking wheel nuts *Infra-red remote central door locking *Comprehensive alarm system with engine immobilisation *Two-piece glass sunroof with T Bar *Sports style seats with lumbar adjustment for both front seats *Electronic 3-band stereo radio/cassette with four speakers *Roof mounted radio aerial *Electric front windows *50/50 split folding rear seat backrest *Height adjustable steering wheel *Tinted glass Options included: *4 speed automatic transmission with torque lock-up *Anti-lock braking system (including rear disc braking) *ICE upgrade including 6 disc CD changer and RDS *Full leather trim set *Driver seat height adjustment *Air conditioning =220 Coup√©= Rover 200 Coupe with original front design This model featured the T series 2.0 litre 16 valve engine, later introduced into the rest of the 200/400 range in 1993. It replaced the M16 unit used in previous models. The 220 Coup√© was priced at ¬£16,670. In naturally aspirated form, the 16 valve T-Series produced at 6000 rpm and a top speed of . 0-60 mph was achieved in 8.2 seconds. Over the 216 Coup√©, the 220 featured: *Rear disc brakes *Anti lock braking system *Front fog lamps *R750 RDS ICE *Leather seat borders *Boot mounted body coloured spoiler Options included: *'TorSen' differential gearbox (deleted from option after first year of production) *ICE upgrade including 6 disc CD changer *Full leather trim set *Driver seat height adjustment *Air conditioning =220 Coup√© Turbo= The flagship of the range, the 220 Coup√© Turbo's performance came from the T-Series 2.0 litre 16 valve engine with turbocharging producing at 6000 rpm and The fastest ever production Rover achieved and a 0 to 60 mph time of 6.2 seconds and 30 to 70 mph in 5.7 seconds in a test by Autocar in October 1992. Torsen torque sensing traction control, uprated suspension and anti lock brakes as standard. The differential is a completely mechanical device so by most manufacturer's standards this would not have been considered to be a 'Traction Control System'. However, the LSD was the reason why the Rover was marketed as having traction control. Anti lock braking (ABS) was standard on the 2.0 litre models. The car was priced at ¬£18,315. Features of the Rover 220 Coup√© Turbo over the naturally aspirated 220 included: *Michelin Pilot tyres 195/55 on 15\\" six spoke 'Turbo' alloy road wheels *Leather trimmed steering wheel and gear knob *Turbo designation on rear appliqu√© panel Options included: *ICE upgrade including six disc CD changer *Full leather trim set *Driver seat height adjustment *CFC free air conditioning Rover Coup√© (1996‚Äì1998) In 1996, Rover announced revisions to the Coup√©, with the range also losing the 200 model name. Two, all new, models were introduced to replace the previous models. The Coup√© 1.6 was now fitted with Rover Group's own K-Series 16 valve double overhead camshaft power unit instead of the previous Honda unit. The 2.0 and Turbo models were replaced by the 1.8 VVC Coupe. Inside, the interior was completely revamped and featured the new rounder dash as fitted to the newer shape Rover 200. The alarm system on all models was again changed and now featured Thatcham approval. The interior trim was lightened from the dark Ash Grey to a lighter Picadilly Grey. The 1.6 was fitted with cloth trim in either red or grey centres whilst the VVC came with the leather side bolsters as seen in previous models. All three models had the option of full smokestone leather. Exterior paint could be specified in seven colours, including one all new colour: Flame Red, Charcoal, Platinum, British Racing Green, Tahiti Blue, Nightfire Red and Amaranth. Near the end of production, Diamond White again became available and another new colour, Anthracite was also available, although this is exceptionally rare. In 1998, Rover Group ceased production of the Coup√©, bringing the R8 range to an end. The Rover Coup√© body shape was never revamped, to bring into line with the new shape 200 and 400. =Coupe 1.6= Rover 220 Coupe The SE model ensured it continued into the new range and again featured a body coloured rear spoiler and front fog lamps over the standard 216 Coup√©. The K-Series 1.6-litre engine produced the same as the previous Honda engine and could reach the same speed. The automatic transmission was again available for the 216 and 216 SE Coup√© models only. The 1.6 was fitted with steel wheels with plastic trims or could be specified with a cost option six spoke 'turbo' alloy wheels. The SE came with an all new five spoke alloy wheels. =Coup√© 1.8 VVC= Launched to replace the 220 and Turbo, the VVC Coup√© used Rover Group's K-Series engine with the addition of variable valve control as used in MG F. The VVC produced , reached and a 0-60 mph time of 7.8 seconds, significantly slower than the previous Turbo model. Export versions The 200 Coup√© was sold throughout Europe, Japan and in New Zealand. The 216 Coup√© sold outside the United Kingdom home market came fitted with double over head camshaft Honda power unit, rather than the single over head camshaft unit fitted to the cars for the United Kingdom. A batch of approximately 330 220 Coup√© Turbo models were exported to Japan in 1995. Rover 200 Coup√© Racing Series In 1993, Rover Group produced 36 specifically modified 200 Coup√© Turbo models. The cars were not undersealed and were seam welded and fully race prepared. The code name Tomcat from the project days was used to create a new race series, the Dunlop Rover Tomcat Race Series. The cars competed against each other around the United Kingdom & Europe for two years until Rover dropped their backing. The series was renamed the Stafford Landrover Super Coup√© Cup and the cars continued to battle it out against each other. Many of the cars are still in existence and some still compete competitively against similar cars that have fallen fate of the end of single make series racing.

Mesk√≥'s personal admiration for Adolf Hitler was significant and he even went as far as growing a toothbrush moustache in an attempt to physically resemble the Nazi Party F√ºhrer. Mesk√≥'s movement also utilised the arrow cross as its emblem, although it alternated this with a green swastika on a brown background and eventually abandoned the brown shirt in favour of a green alternative.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, Methuen, 1974, p. 174 As a result, the group became known colloquially as the Greenshirts and they continued to operate within Mesk√≥'s earlier field of agrarian politics to an extent by seeking to build a support base amongst landless peasants.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-1945, London, Roultedge, 2001, p. 270 The group was largely unsuccessful however and the Greenshirts were unable to establish anything approaching the mass following that Mesk√≥ sought. Later years Mesk√≥ became one of the three leaders of the amalgamated Hungarian National Socialist Party in 1934, alongside S√°ndor Festetics, who had his own Hungarian National Socialist People‚Äôs Party and Fid√©l P√°lffy, whose group already bore the Hungarian National Socialist Party name. Mesk√≥ however was expelled as part of a power struggle the following year as P√°lffy made himself sole leader. Mesk√≥ was noted as the least radical of Hungary's competing Nazi leaders as throughout his period as a leader he maintained a loyalty to the regency of Mikl√≥s Horthy where other Hungarian Nazis sought the Admiral's overthrowing. Mesk√≥ initially attempted to reform the Greenshirts but he proved to be unsuccessful in these efforts. He was returned to parliament in the 1939 parliamentary election as an independent Nazi, although his fervour for Hitler had begun to dampen. Increasingly disillusioned with Nazi Germany, he played little role in the wartime politics of Hungary. Despite this he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1945, although he was released before his death.

He sees a beautiful Italian woman in the Cusamanos' back yard next door. She tells him her name is Isabella and that she is a foreign exchange student staying there while the Cusamanos are away. He takes her out to lunch and she describes the beauty of Avellino, where Tony's grandfather came from. He has a daydream about Isabella in a rocking-chair in a village house, nursing a baby named Antonio. One day Isabella is no longer there. When the Cusamanos return Tony asks about her and realizes he has been hallucinating. Dr. Melfi instructs him to stop taking lithium, and theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure. Mikey, acting through Donnie Paduana, contracts two black gunmen to carry out the hit on Tony. Junior cannot bear to hear the details of the plan when Mikey tries to report. Chris is concerned about his boss's emotional state and secretly follows him, unknowingly preventing the hit when he pulls his car up next to the assassins'. There is an urgent outdoor meeting between Mikey and Donnie, with Junior hiding in the back seat of Mikey's car. Donnie promises the hit will be the next day and casually remarks that even Tony's mother wants him dead. Junior, fearing the gossip, gestures to Mikey that he should kill Donnie, and he does it. The next day, the assassins make their move. In a ferocious struggle, one of them is killed and the other is briefly dragged along the street as Tony drives away. Elated, he can't help crashing into a parked car. In the hospital, Tony says that his injuries, only minor, occurred in an attempted carjack, a story that not even A.J. believes. FBI Agent Harris comes to his bed and offers a deal, including immunity from prosecution, which Tony scornfully rejects. The next day, Livia and Junior call on Tony at home.

The dam is the lowermost of nine dams on the river owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the late 1930s and early 1940s to improve navigation on the lower part of the river and reduce flooding on the lower Ohio and Mississippi rivers. It was a major project initiated during the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, to invest in infrastructure to benefit the country. The dam impounds the Kentucky Lake of , which is the largest of TVA's reservoirs and the largest artificial lake by area in the Eastern United States.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Kentucky Project: A Comprehensive Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, and Initial Operations of the Kentucky Project, Technical Report No. 13 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1951), pp. 1-12, 68, 115-116, 509. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. A canal connects Kentucky Lake to nearby Lake Barkley, created by Barkley Dam on the Cumberland River. The lakes run parallel for more than 50 miles (80 km), with the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area located between them. Location Kentucky Dam is located slightly more than above the mouth of the Tennessee River, which empties into the Ohio River at Paducah, Kentucky. After absorbing the Tennessee, the Ohio flows for another before emptying into the Mississippi River at Cairo, Illinois. The dam is approximately north of the Kentucky-Tennessee border and southeast of the Kentucky-Illinois border. The city of Grand Rivers is located southeast of the dam, and Gilbertsville and Calvert City are immediately downstream. Kentucky Lake stretches southward for across Kentucky and most of the length of Tennessee to the base of Pickwick Landing Dam, near the Tennessee-Alabama line. It is within parts of Livingston, Marshall, Lyon, Calloway, and Trigg counties in Kentucky and parts of Humphreys, Benton, Decatur, Stewart, Carroll, Wayne, Henderson, Henry, Perry, Houston, and Hardin counties in Tennessee. Barkley Dam, which is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is located along the Cumberland River just opposite Lake City a few miles east of Kentucky Dam. The canal connecting Kentucky and Barkley lakes joins Kentucky Lake approximately upstream from Kentucky Dam. Capacity Kentucky Dam is high; more than half the dam is submerged by water. At long, Kentucky Dam is the longest dam on the Tennessee River and the longest in the TVA system. The dam has a generating capacity of 223,100 kilowatts, and its 24-bay spillway has a total discharge of . Kentucky Lake's of shoreline, of water surface, and of flood storage are the most of any lake in the TVA system.Tennessee Valley Authority, Kentucky Reservoir. Retrieved: 20 January 2009. Kentucky Dam is served by a navigation lock, soon to be supplemented by a larger lock which will be better able to accommodate the long barge tows that navigate the river in the 21st century.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kentucky Lock Project Fact Sheet . Retrieved: 20 January 2009. A large industrial complex of chemical plants has developed below the dam near Calvert City due to the convenient barge transportation and inexpensive TVA electricity. The locks' lift raises and lowers vessels up to between Kentucky Lake and the lower part of the river. Background and construction The original design plan for Kentucky Dam, circa 1938 Throughout the 19th century, Congress passed a series of initiatives to improve navigation on the Tennessee River between the river's mouth and Florence, Alabama. By the 1890s, a continuous channel had been secured, but was still deemed insufficient for major river traffic. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted an extensive survey of the lower river in the early 1900s, and recommended constructing a dam at Aurora Landing (roughly above the present site), but the project was never funded. In the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority sought to create a continuous minimum channel along the entirety of the river from Paducah to Knoxville. The Authority also sought to help control flooding on the lower Mississippi River, especially in the aftermath of the destructive Ohio River flood of 1937. Research had shown that 4% of the water in the lower Mississippi originates in the Tennessee River watershed. TVA surveyed the lower part of the river and considered the Aurora Landing site, but eventually settled on the present site at river mile 22.4. The Kentucky Dam project was authorized by Congress on May 23, 1938, and construction began July 1, 1938. Aerial view of Kentucky Dam's lock The construction of Kentucky Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of land, of which had to be cleared. 2,609 families, 3,390 graves, and of roads had to be relocated. 65 new bridges were built, 7 were rebuilt, and 3 were razed. The Illinois Central Railroad-- which crossed a bridge just downstream from the dam-- was rerouted to cross the top of the dam. The communities of Johnsonville and Springville in Tennessee, and Birmingham in Kentucky were completely inundated by the project. A protective dike was constructed at Big Sandy, Tennessee to protect the town from reservoir backwaters. Kentucky Dam was completed and its gates closed on August 30, 1944, and its first generator went online September 14, 1944. The project cost nearly $118 million, making it the most expensive TVA dam project. Kentucky Dam's navigation lock was the first lock designed by TVA-- the Corps of Engineers had designed the locks for previous TVA dam projects. The Corps of Engineers is designing the new lock, which was scheduled for completion in 2008. Since Kentucky Dam is located in the New Madrid Seismic Zone -- which produced earthquakes of estimated magnitude 7.0 to 7.9 in 1811 -- it is one of the few TVA dams built to withstand major earthquake shocks. Emergency preparedness officials in Marshall County and McCracken County, Kentucky (downstream from the dam) and a TVA spokesman discussed concerns of the public about the dam in 2005 in a local newspaper, The Paducah Sun. The dam was regarded as well maintained. Experts suggested that any dam failure would probably occur in the earthen levees at the end of the concrete portion of the dam, and the subsequent release would start small and enlarge as water poured through it. It is not expected that a wall of water would suddenly go down the river. Instead, the water level would rise slowly over at least six hours before flooding the Calvert City chemical plants. The floodwater should reach only the base of the Paducah floodwall.Bill Bartleman, \\"Dam Safety Attracts Public Concern\\", The Paducah Sun, 28 September 2005. Retrieved: 20 January 2009. The dam also carried a railroad line and two lanes of US 62/641 at its crest. However, due to the planned lock expansion, two new crossings were built just downstream of the dam‚Äîa two-lane road bridge and a separate rail bridge. The new bridges were opened in late 2009. The road atop the dam is still in use for local traffic accessing the dam's powerhouse and visitor center, but is no longer a complete crossing, as the bridges that crossed the locks are now closed.

Geography The lush and fertile valley lies between Catoctin Mountain and the Bull Run Mountains to the east and the Blue Ridge Mountains to the west. To the north it is bound by the Potomac River and to the south by the Broken Hills of Fauquier County. The small portion of the valley residing in Fauquier County is known as Upper Fauquier. The valley varies between and in width and is approximately long. The northern section of the valley is bisected by Short Hill Mountain. The area west of the Short Hill is known as Between the Hills and is distinct from the Loudoun Valley, while the area to the east, sometimes referred to as the Catoctin Valley, is associated with it. Major watercourses include Goose Creek, Catoctin Creek, Panther Skin Run, and the Little River. The three major highways across the valley are U.S. Route 50, which runs from Aldie on the east to Ashby Gap on the west; Route 7, which runs from Clarke's Gap west of Leesburg to Snickers Gap west of Bluemont; and Route 9, which diverges from Route 7 at Clarke's Gap and runs west to Keyes Gap on the West Virginia border. The terrain is rolling, with numerous ridges and hills; the elevation here ranges between above sea level. The soil is formed from gneiss, clay / slate, hornblende, greenstone, and quartz particles, a fertile and durable soil, containing alumina, silex, potash, lime, and other natural fertilizing minerals. History =Settlement= Following the 1722 Treaty of Albany, which kept the American Indian nations west of the Blue Ridge Mountains, settlers began slowly to move into the Loudoun Valley. Many of the early residents were immigrants from southern Pennsylvania ‚Äî Quakers, Scotch-Irish, and Germans interested in starting small farms. The Quakers had significant influence in the central Loudoun Valley, settling in and around such communities as Waterford, Hillsboro, Goose Creek (now Lincoln), and Union (now Unison). Their stone buildings are a major feature of the Loudoun landscape. Germans settled in the northern end of the Loudoun Valley, especially in the area around Lovettsville, leaving a number of log structures as their architectural legacy. Unlike the settlers to the east and south, neither of these groups practiced slavery. In the southern portion of the valley, centered on Middleburg, settlers of English descent moving west from the Tidewater region imported slave-based plantation-style agriculture. During the antebellum period, the area became a leading center of agriculture production, particularly of wheat, oats, rye, and corn. =Civil War= During the Civil War, the Loudoun Valley saw considerable fighting. Owing the Valley's divided loyalties, one-time neighbors took up arms against one another in bitter partisan fighting. Unionists from the northern portion of the Valley formed the partisan Loudoun Rangers, while southern sympathizers in the southern portion joined a number of partisan Confederate units including White's Rebels and Mosby's Rangers. These units frequently engaged one another in the Valley throughout the duration of the war, most noticeably at the Fight at Waterford in 1862 when White's Rebels engaged the Loudoun Rangers for the first time. Major engagements between the regular armies also occurred in the Valley, particularly in 1862 and 1863. In November 1862, following the Battle of Antietam, Union Gen. George McClellan marched his army through the Valley in slow pursuit of the retreating Army of Northern Virginia. Confederate cavalry under Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart fought a delaying action against the vanguard of the Union columns during the often overlooked Battle of Unison. During the Gettysburg Campaign, a series of cavalry clashes between J.E.B. Stuart and Alfred Pleasonton occurred in the valley at Aldie, Middleburg, Goose Creek, and Upperville. Stuart successfully kept the Federal forces from entering the adjacent Shenandoah Valley and discovering Robert E. Lee's main army. In 1864, as General Jubal Early withdrew from Washington, Union forces attacked his supply wagons at Heaton's Crossroads at present-day Purcellville. In the early winter of 1864, General Phillip Sheridan had the Loudoun Valley put to the torch during The Burning Raid in response to actions of Confederate partisans John Mosby who used the Loudoun Valley as his base of operations. =Modern era= Following the war, the Loudoun Valley was slow to recover from the devastation of the Burning Raid, but soon the region became a major source of agricultural products again, particularly notable for its numerous dairy farms. Farming remained a main occupation for several generations until the early 1990s when urban growth began encroaching from the east. Though farming has lost its prominence in the valley it maintains a strong presence. Loudoun County ranks 20th in overall agriculture production in the state. Corn, wheat and beans remain staple crops, while berry production has increased dramatically (ranked 1st in the state). Christmas tree farming (3rd in the state) and livestock (11th in state for sheep and lamb, 14th in state for cattle) are also major agricultural ventures.National Capital Farms In the last decade the emergence of vineyards and wineries in the valley has led to it being a top producer of wine in the state.Loudoun Wine Sources * Loudoun Museum website * Head, James W., History and Comprehensive Description of Loudoun County Virginia, Parkview Press, 1908.

Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Prologue During the episode: * Tim Brooke-Taylor also appears as Mime Tim * Graeme Garden also appears as Mime Graeme * Bill Oddie also appears as Mime Bill Plot The Goodies are running their own holiday service. The Detectives Club book their annual holiday on the 'Detectives Mystery Tour', and several members dressed as famous detectives arrive to go on the mystery train. The Mystery Train is at the station and, after the detectives are aboard, Bill runs up and down the platform with a life-sized model cow on wheels to represent a cow that is being passed, and antlers on his head to represent a deer that is being passed -- to make the detectives feel that the train is moving (which it isn't). On the train, Graeme is the narrator for the 'journey', while Tim dresses up in clothing suitable for the country the train is supposed to be going through. A goat supplies extra verisimilitude. Then, mysterious things start to happen: the train takes off down the track, with Bill running after it (later catching up to the train and boarding it) -- and the world's great detectives begin to disappear. Graeme sniffs a bottle labelled 'Arsenic' and says: \\"Aha! The characteristic smell of bitter almonds!\\" Bill asks: \\"Isn't that cyanide?\\" to which Graeme replies: \\"Precisely. This arsenic has been poisoned!\\" More detectives disappear and Bill states: \\"Ten little s, sitting down to dine, someone cut their cufflinks off, now, there's only nine.\\" Later, Bill resumes, commenting: \\"Nine little s, sitting there in state, someone lit the touchpaper, now, there's only eight.\\" The train keeps moving on -- not always on rail. It is discovered that a group of badly behaved mimes are behind the mysterious events, and that they had stolen the train as part of an attempt to win the legendary \\"Gold Bore\\" at the French \\"Le Boring\\" competition. So the Goodies and the detectives chase the mimes on wheelchairs. One by one detectives fail capturing the three criminals but, luckily, just as the mimes about to escape by the harbour, the goat rams at them and falls onto their boat. The Goodies arrive just in time to see the mimes sink with their hats above the water.

Painting owned by G√§strike-H√§lsinge nation, Uppsala. Anders Uppstr√∂m (29 June 1806 - 21 January 1865) was a Swedish philologist, particularly known for his work on the Codex Argenteus, the manuscript of Bishop Wulfila's Gothic Bible translation held by the Uppsala University Library. Born into the family of a factory worker at Hammarby bruk in G√§strikland, Uppstr√∂m had his education partly paid for by his father's employer Tore Petr√©. After completing school in G√§vle, he enrolled at Uppsala University in 1824, and was awarded the highest degree at the Faculty of Philosophy, filosofie magister, in 1833. He worked as a teacher of Greek and Hebrew at the Uppsala Cathedral School between 1835 and 1859 (as kollega from 1834, f√∂rste adjunkt from 1845, and lektor -- lecturer -- from 1858). He was appointed docent of the Gothic language at the University in 1850, and professor extraordinary of \\"Mesogothic and related languages\\" in 1859. Uppstr√∂m started studying Gothic in 1834 and became docent based on his dissertation, Aivaggeljo √æairh Mat√æaiu eller Fragmenterna af Matth√¶i Evangelium p√• g√∂tiska jemte ordf√∂rklaring och ordb√∂jningsl√§ra, for which the Swedish Academy awarded him its Royal Prize. In 1854, he published an edition of the parts of Wulfila's Gothic Bible translation that were known from the manuscript Codex Argenteus. This codex had been kept in Uppsala since the late seventeenth century and is thought to have originated at the court of Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great (d. 526). His edition contained only the text from the 177 manuscript leaves then extant, ten leaves having mysteriously disappeared between 1821 and 1834. The ten missing leaves were recovered in 1857, returned to Uppstr√∂m by an old library janitor on his deathbed. Uppstr√∂m published a supplement to his previous edition, Decem Codicis argente√¶ rediviva folia the same year. A journey in 1860 to Rome, Milan, and Wolfenb√ºttel, financed by the sons of his childhood patron Petr√©, resulted in Fragmenta gothica selecta (1861) and another journey to the Ambrosian Library in Milan in 1863 to study the so-called Ambrosian Gothic manuscripts led to Codices gotici ambrosiani, which was published posthumously by his son Anders Erik Wilhelm Uppstr√∂m in 1868. Uppstr√∂m also published works on comparative Indo-European linguistics, Swedish dialects, and a variety of other topics.

Cypress Springs High School was established in 1997, making it the sixth high school within Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District to open its doors to students in the Cypress and Katy areas. Since 2015, the school's principal has been Dr. Cheryl T. Henry. From 2012-2015, the school's principal was Travis Fanning and from 2008-2012, the school's principal was Barbara Weiman, one of the former Associate Principals before her promotion. Prior to Mrs. Weiman becoming principal, Sarah Harty was principal, until she was chosen to be the first principal of nearby Cypress Lakes High School which opened in 2008. The first principal to serve was Alan Meek, who helped establish the school in 1997. History The graduating class of 2008 was Cypress Springs' largest senior class with more than 1,000 students walking the stage at the Richard E. Berry Educational Support Center to receive their diplomas. In the 2005-2006 school year, attendance at this high school reached more than 4,000 students due to the building boom taking place in the local area, making for a crowded school and crowded hallways. In 2016 a wave of CFISD high school rezoning occurred. Cypress Park High School opened, taking a portion of the Cypress Springs zone. In addition another portion of the Cypress Springs zone was given to Cypress Lakes High School. In turn, a section of the Langham Creek High School attendance zone was reassigned to Cypress Springs.\\"Final Recommendation 1-11-16.\\" Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District.

The school is owned and operated by the States of Jersey. Overview In 2012, the school had approximately 680 pupils. During the academic year 2004/2005 the GCSE pass rate was 100%, at which 40% gained A* to A grades. At A level there was an 87% pass rate of which 79% obtained grades A-C. Admission into Hautlieu depends on the result of CAT, Cognitive Abilities Test, exams with a minimum result of 109, as well as the results of the PT, Progress Test, in English and Maths (PTE and PTM respectively) with a minimum result of 103 on both tests. It is, however, possible for determined students who have not achieved the necessary CAT or PT scores to appeal. Over the years it has been suggested by politicians that Hautlieu should be converted to a sixth-form college and the 14+ system (which some regard as controversial) be abolished. Admission criteria Hautlieu differs from other state secondary schools in Jersey, in that students must meet specific criteria before being eligible for application to attend the school.2012 Prospectus History Construction of Hautlieu's first building began on the 18 April 1951 and was officially opened on the 5 April 1952, and was originally a boys' grammar school until the admission of its first female student in 1962. Hautlieu's successful exam results have received positive reports from Her Majesty's Inspectors. As of June 2003, Hautlieu no longer automatically accepts year 10 pupils.

Background Coming from one of Hungary's leading families (his father was Andor Festetics), Count Festetics was amongst those chosen to serve in the cabinet of Mih√°ly K√°rolyi, being appointed Minister of Defence in 1918. Although this was to prove ill-fated, Festetics remained committed to parliamentary politics, becoming a supporter of Istv√°n Bethlen.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990. p. 125 Politics and embrace of Nazism After a spell away from politics, Festetics, who had become convinced of Nazism, took charge of the tiny Hungarian National Socialist Peoples Party in 1933, using the fortune he had inherited from his uncle Prince Taszil√≥ to seek to expand the group. This party was effectively a copy of the Nazi Party, taking over most of its 25 point programme.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945, Routledge, 1996, p. 270 By 1934, he had come together with Zolt√°n Mesk√≥ and Fid√©l P√°lffy to form an alliance of their movements. Before long, however, he was expelled as his commitment to anti-Semitism was seen to be weak; Festetics had continued to employ Jews on his estates. He then became associated with minor movements led by Istv√°n Balogh and K√°lm√°n Hubay, sitting in parliament from 1935 until his retirement in 1939 under various labels. In keeping with some of his contemporaries who preached against the influence of the Jews, Festetics was attracted to the idea of Zionism as a solution to what he saw as the Jewish problem in Europe. Indeed, in a 1934 session of Parliament, he announced that the Zionists should be encouraged because all people, including the Jews, had a right to live in their own land, and revealed that he had even allowed a Zionist organisation to use his land for an agricultural training programme for a group of Jewish youths who were preparing to migrate to Palestine.Herbert Arthur Strauss, Hostages of Modernization: Studies on Modern Antisemitism, 1993, p. 936 Retirement from politics Festetics brought an end to his political career in 1939.C.P.

Glenfarclas translates as meaning valley of the green grass. The distillery is owned and run by the Grant family. The distillery has six stills which are the largest on Speyside and are heated directly by gas burners. The distillery has a production capacity of around 3.5 million litres of spirit per year. Normally four stills are used for production with two kept in reserve. The distillery has approximately 68,000 casks maturing on site, in traditional dunnage warehouses, with stock from every year from 1953 to the current year.

The distillery was first granted a licence in 1836Malt Whisky Yearbook 2010 when it was run by Robert Hay. On 8 June 1865 it was bought by John Grant and is still owned and run by his descendants, making it truly independent. John Grant sent his son George G. Grant to run the operations at Glenfarclas. In 1890, on the death of George G. Grant, his widow Elsie took over the licence for the distillery. At some time over the following years, Elsie handed active management of the Distillery to her sons John and George. The Grants formed a partnership with Pattisons Ltd in August 1896 at the height of the whisky boom. After the crash that followed, the Grants resumed full ownership of the distillery. John retired due to ill health in 1913 and George became sole proprietor. In 1947 Glenfarclas became a private limited company, owned by George's sons, George S. Grant and John P. Grant. John L.S. Grant, who joined Glenfarclas in 1973, is the current Chairman. His son George S. Grant is Director of Sales. The company was named Distiller of the Year by Whisky Magazine in 2006.Whisky Magazine Issue 54, April 2006 Since 2006 Glenfarclas has been distributed in the UK by Pol Roger Ltd.

After the 1967 season Slack made the decision to pave the track because according to his grandson Roger Slack, the high maintenance of preparing the dirt for weekly racing. Cayuga International Speedway was also increased slightly in size to 5/8 of a mile when it was paved but it was still a \\"D\\"-shape, the back stretch maintaining a slight but noticeable curve. A smaller flat oval was built inside the track that was used to race some race divisions like mini stocks and Can-Am TQ (three quarter) midgets. The smaller oval used part of the big tracks front straight away and the same start finish line. It also doubled as the pit road for long events that required teams to make pit stops. The small track was removed in the early 1980s so that a straight pit lane could be built, and the infield pit area benefited by gaining some space. Set on 300 acres (120 hectares) of land, Cayuga offers campgrounds with electricity, concession booths, and free parking. In 2002 track owners Bob and Leone Slack were inducted to the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame for their dedication to the Speedway. =Major events= The track has held a variety of different racing groups including the American Speed Association, CASCAR, NASCAR Canadian Tire Series, the American Canadian Tour, NASCAR Busch North, Hooters Pro-Cup, USAC, International Supermodified Association (ISMA), DIRT Modifieds and the ARCA RE/MAX Series (which is considered to be one of the developmental milestones to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series). On June 8, 2006, a group of developers from Toronto purchased the ‚Öù mile track from Bob and Leone Slack and made improvements for the 2007 season, hoping to attract NASCAR Nationwide Series (formerly called the Busch Series) to have a race at Cayuga Speedway. Instead, the race went to Montreal (Circuit Gilles Villeneuve) due to its larger population and recognition in the international community.The Simcoe Reformer - June 8, 2006 Cooper Construction of Oakville was announced as the vendor to re-build the track. Cayuga International Speedway Park hosted the first NASCAR Canadian Tire Series race in series history on May 26, 2007. =Closure= The final NASCAR Canadian Tire Series race to be held here was the 2008 Coke Zero 200. The last race held at the speedway was in July 2009 featuring the ISMA Supermodifieds; which was won by Mark Sammut of London, Ontario. This event would earn Sammut his first ISMA win.

Morriss (born May 13, 1951) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the offensive line coach at Lexington Christian Academy in Lexington, Kentucky. Before joining Lexington Christian, he was a special assistant to the athletic director at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce, where he was also the head football coach from 2009 to 2012. Morriss also served as the head football coach at the University of Kentucky for two seasons (2001‚Äì2002) and at Baylor University for five seasons (2003‚Äì2007). He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU) and spent 15 seasons as an offensive lineman in National Football League (NFL) with the Philadelphia Eagles (1973‚Äì1983) and the New England Patriots (1984‚Äì1987). Morriss played in over 200 regular season games during his NFL career and started at center for the Eagles in Super Bowl XV. Early years and playing career Morriss was born in Colorado City, Texas. Morriss's father was a graduate of Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce, where Morriss later became head football coach. For high school, he attended Sam Houston High School in Arlington, Texas where he was a standout lineman and earned a scholarship to Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas. He graduated from TCU in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in secondary education. A second round selection in the 1973 NFL draft, he was a Pro Bowl center in the National Football League (NFL), where he played with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1973 to 1983, and the New England Patriots from 1984 to 1987. Coaching career =Early career= Morriss got his coaching start in 1988 as the offensive line coach for the Patriots under Raymond Berry. In 1992, after a brief stint as the head coach of the Washington Marauders of the Professional Spring Football League, Morriss coached at Valdosta State University under Hal Mumme, the father of the modern air raid offense, and alongside Mike Leach. He later re-joined Mumme and Leach in 1997 at Kentucky, where he was offensive line and assistant head coach. Morriss was given national recognition for his pass blocking schemes that helped turn Kentucky's offense into one of the best in the nation. =Kentucky= After a recruiting scandal forced the resignation of Mumme at Kentucky, Morriss was named the school's interim head coach in 2001. After a 2‚Äì9 season, Kentucky named Morriss the school's permanent head coach, where he led the Wildcats to a 7‚Äì5 turnaround season in 2002. Guy Morriss was the losing coach in the famed \\"Bluegrass Miracle\\" game at Commonwealth Stadium in 2002. Morriss's Kentucky Wildcats kicked a field goal to take the lead over LSU with 11 seconds left, only to lose on an 80-yard Hail Mary pass as time expired. Seconds before the Hail Mary, Morriss was doused with Gatorade by quarterback Jared Lorenzen in (what turned out to be) a premature \\"victory bath.\\" =Baylor= Morriss took over a Baylor program that had hit the skids. The Bears hadn't had a winning season since 1995, and had posted only one conference victory in its previous 36 Big 12 contests. Morriss's first season in 2003 (3‚Äì9) was rough but was highlighted by an upset win over Colorado (CU was a 20-point favorite). Morriss's second season in 2004 again only led to three wins and one conference win, but Morriss gained fan and alumni support with the team's 35‚Äì34 overtime upset win over #16 Texas A&M; (a 25-point favorite), in which Morriss made a gutsy call to \\"go for two\\" to win in the first overtime, instead of kicking the extra point and forcing a second overtime. It was BU's first win over the Aggies since 1985 (they tied in 1990). Morriss's third season in 2005 produced a 5‚Äì6 record (BU's best since 1995) and featured BU's first ever road win over a Big 12 Conference opponent, a 23‚Äì13 victory over Iowa State in Ames. In 2006, the fourth year of the Morriss era, BU had a roller coaster season. After a disappointing 1‚Äì3 non-conference mark (including a loss at home to Army), BU rebounded with a 3‚Äì1 start in conference play. However, the momentum was stunted when quarterback Shawn Bell was injured in a loss to Texas A&M;, and Baylor was subsequently blown out in their final three games by an average margin of 34 points, finishing the year at 4‚Äì8 (3‚Äì5 in the Big 12). In 2007, Morriss failed again to produce a winning record for the Bears, as Baylor finished with a 3‚Äì9 record. The loss of a significant number of seniors, including Bell, was part of the blame for the poor season. In the season opener, Baylor was shut out by TCU, 27‚Äì0, but managed to win the next three non-conference games. Afterwards, Baylor did not defeat any of its Big 12 opponents, their last defeat being the 12th consecutive loss in Big 12 play. On November 18, 2007, Baylor fired Morriss. On November 28, 2007, former University of Houston head coach Art Briles replaced Morriss. =Kentucky State= In March 2008, Morriss accepted a job as a position coach at Kentucky State University. Morriss was the first person with coaching experience in a BCS conference to go to work in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (a division II league consisting of historically black colleges and universities). =Texas A&M;‚ÄìCommerce= In December 2008, Scott Conley was removed as head coach of the Texas A&M;‚ÄìCommerce Lions football program after a 24‚Äì27 record in five seasons. On January 7, 2009, Morriss was offered the job to succeed Conley by athletic director Carlton Cooper and university president Daniel Jones. Morriss's tenure at Texas A&M;‚ÄìCommerce began with five losses, before the Lions reeled off five straight wins, finishing 5‚Äì5 overall with a 5‚Äì0 record in their division, winning the North Division of the Lone Star Conference outright. That gave Texas A&M;‚ÄìCommerce its first division title since 2007 and its first outright title of any kind since 1990. Morriss also introduced the idea of wearing throwback jerseys that had the moniker \\"EAST TEXAS\\" on the front, as homage to the schools previous name, East Texas State University. After Morriss's first season, players from his football team coordinated an effort to illegally remove all copies of a student newspaper from campus because it contained an unfavorable article about a teammate who had been arrested on drug charges. Morriss said that he was \\"proud\\" of his players for taking the newspapers. He also referred to the theft as \\"the best team building exercise we have ever done.\\" Morriss was subsequently disciplined by the school administration over the incident. The 2010 season started with much excitement as a massive renovation to Memorial Stadium in Commerce was completed that added 3,500 seats to the east side of the stadium, a second press box, a new scoreboard with a video jumbotron, and new locker rooms. The Lions christened their newly renovated stadium by routing Upper Iowa, 33‚Äì10, giving Morriss six straight wins as head coach. However, the Lions only won two more games the rest of the season and finished with a disappointing 3‚Äì8 season. The 2011 season only produced one win, a 60‚Äì28 win over Eastern New Mexico, and the Lions finished 1‚Äì9. 2012 produced an identical record of 1‚Äì9, the lone victory coming over long time rival Texas A&M;‚ÄìKingsville, 21‚Äì14 in overtime. On November 12, 2012, after leading the A&M;‚ÄìCommerce football program for four seasons, Morriss stepped down as head football coach. He stayed on at A&M;‚ÄìCommerce as special assistant to the athletic director. His duties included fundraising, teaching, and oversight of athletic facilities and special projects. Personal life Morriss resides in Lexington, Kentucky and is married to Jackie Morriss. They are the parents of five daughters: Melanie, Colleen, Kerry, Savannah and Austin. The couple also has five grandchildren. Despite now living in Kentucky again, he is known to be proud of his Texas heritage. His first comment to the press when accepting the Baylor job was yelling \\"It's good to be back in the Lone Star.\\" Baylor even put that phrase on their pocket schedules for 2003. Also, Morriss told FOX Sports that when his future wife asked him what nationality he was, he replied \\"I'm a Texan.\\" In 2012, Morriss graduated from the Texas A&M-Commerce; graduate school with a master's degree and received his diploma with a rousing ovation. In 2017 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease.

He is the defensive coordinator at Auburn University. Steele previously served as defensive coordinator at LSU and coached inside linebackers at Alabama. Previously, he was the defensive coordinator at Clemson University from 2009 until early 2012. From 1999 to 2002, Steele served as the head football coach at Baylor University, compiling a record of 9‚Äì36 overall and 1‚Äì31 in the Big 12 Conference. Playing career Steele played three seasons of collegiate football as a linebacker. He spent his freshman year at Furman University before transferring to Tennessee, where he was a member of Johnny Majors' 1978 and 1979 squads. Coaching career =Career as an assistant= From 1989 to 1994, Steele coached the linebackers under Nebraska legend Tom Osborne. During his six years in Lincoln, the Cornhuskers went 60-11, appeared in six bowl games, won four conference championships and captured the 1994 national championship with a 13-0 record. He coached Butkus Award winner Trev Alberts during that time. He was also an assistant coach at Florida State University, University of Tennessee, Oklahoma State University and New Mexico State University. On January 4, 2007, Steele was hired by new Alabama coach Nick Saban as defensive coordinator for the Crimson Tide. =Carolina Panthers= In 1995, Steele moved to the NFL as the linebackers coach for the Carolina Panthers. Under head coach Dom Capers, the Panthers reached the NFC Championship Game in their second season (1996). A well publicized moment occurred during Steele's last year in Carolina. Linebacker Kevin Greene attacked Steele during a heated discussion, grabbing the coach by his clothing. The incident was captured on live television. Steele did not retaliate.Description of incident \\"Football is an emotional, aggressive game,\\" Steele said. \\"Those guys are out there fighting. Kevin is a good person. We've talked about it and worked it out. That's all I have to say about it.\\"Washingtonpost.com: Greene Attacks Assistant Coach on Carolina Sideline =Head coaching career= Steele was the head coach at Baylor University from 1999 to 2002. His record was 9‚Äì36 (1‚Äì31 in the Big 12 conference). In Steele's first season (1999), Baylor finished with a 1‚Äì10 record (the school's worst since 1969). During the 1999 season, Steele's Baylor team was involved in what ESPN.com called one of the top 10 worst coaching decisions. The decision came when he chose a running play rather than a kneel down with Baylor leading and possessing the ball in the game's final 12 seconds and their opponent, the UNLV Rebels, was out of time outs. The ensuing Baylor fumble and UNLV return for a touchdown gave the Rebels a shocking win.\\"Steele's costly attitude\\" Steele's second season began with a 2‚Äì1 non-conference record but was followed by eight straight Big 12 losses, only one closer than 24 points. A particularly rough stretch in October saw the Bears shut out in three consecutive games (the last of which was a 59‚Äì0 loss at Nebraska, where the Huskers led 38‚Äì0 after the first quarter). Part of BU's offensive woes were caused by the season ending collarbone injury to heralded offseason JUCO transfer quarterback Greg Cicero, who was injured in the season's second game. Steele's third season in 2001 started with a 2‚Äì0 record (including an exciting overtime win over New Mexico). Steele's fourth season (2002) had a terrible beginning. For opening day, Baylor traveled to Berkeley to play California. Since Cal had finished 1‚Äì10 the previous year, many felt this was a good matchup. However, Cal (who turned out to be greatly improved in 2002) immediately took command of the game, jumping to a 35‚Äì0 lead and cruising to a 70‚Äì22 win. Although the team rallied from the defeat to win three of the next four games (the last a 35‚Äì32 win over Kansas for Steele's first Big 12 conference win), they could not sustain the momentum, losing their next four conference games by wide margins and Steele was fired after the fourth (a 62‚Äì11 loss to Texas Tech). After the firing, Steele elected to finish the season and continued as head coach for the season's last three games, all losses. Steele was succeeded by coach Guy Morriss. Family Steele is a native of Dillon, South Carolina. He and his wife, Linda, have a son (Gordon) and a daughter (Caroline).

The gases can be thought to enter the cylinder head and then change direction in order to exit the head. This is in contrast to the crossflow cylinder head design.  Disadvantages  The reverse flow design is generally considered to be inferior to a crossflow design in terms of ultimate engineering potential for two reasons. Firstly, there is limited space when inlet and exhaust ports are arranged in a line on one side of the head meaning a reduction in port area compared to a crossflow head. This mainly affects power delivery at high rpm by limiting airflow. Secondly, since inlet and exhaust manifolds are both on the same side of the engine and in close proximity, the inlet manifold and carburetor (if applicable) are heated by the exhaust. This heating reduces the density of the inlet charge and hence the volumetric efficiency of the engine. In a spark-ignition petrol engine the heat also increases the likelihood of pre-ignition or detonation which limits the allowable compression ratio reducing both power and efficiency.  Solutions  Engineering has found a number of solutions to the first problem such as staggering the ports by placing the inlet ports on a higher level than the exhausts. This way larger ports can be used while still leaving enough room for flanges and fasteners. This brings with it the problem that the exhaust ports have a tighter turn radius. This problem is somewhat offset by the larger port. Another popular solution, as used in the BMC A-Series and Holden 6-cylinder engines is the siamesed port. In this configuration one large port feeds 2 adjacent cylinders. The gain in area comes from effectively removing the material between 2 adjacent ports. This solution encourages charge robbing, where one cylinder \\"robs\\" the charge from the port leaving the next one with less mixture. This happens because the 2 cylinders which share the port are not equally spaced in terms of firing order. For example, the Leyland Mini with its 1-3-4-2 firing order has the 1 and 2 inlets siamesed and the 3 and 4 inlets siamesed. First the number 3 sucks the mixture out of the port, then there is less left for number 4. While number 1 and 2 are sucking the port again fills with mixture and the process repeats leaving the number 1 and 4 cylinders always lacking mixture. Also the siamese port can make both acoustic and inertial ram tuning less effective due to the irregular pulse. One should keep in mind that larger ports are only necessary at higher rpm and that small ports are desirable at low rpm to improve air speed. Due to charge robbing and lower air speeds, large siamesed ports are more suited to high rpm race motors. The heat problem can be minimized by staggering the ports in terms of height and using heat proof wraps and coatings on the exhaust header to the point that it poses a negligible problem. The heat can also be used as an advantage.  Advantages  In carbureted engines, poorly atomized fuel reduces efficiency and power at lower rpm (at higher rpm the large air speed keeps the mixture in suspension). The inlet manifold of a reverse-flow cylinder head may be connected to the exhaust by a heat riser to transfer further heat, improving low rpm response and emissions as a result. Costs can be reduced in production engines by casting the inlet and exhaust manifolds as one unit. This also transfers further heat to the inlet eliminating the need for manifold heating and other related devices. Such an engine is overall simpler and also has improved cold starting. The main advantage of the reverse-flow cylinder head is that both the entering inlet charge and the exiting exhaust gas cause a tendency to swirl in the same direction in the combustion chamber. In a crossflow head the inlet and exhaust gases promote swirl in opposite directions so that during overlap the swirl changes directions. The constant swirl during overlap which results in a reverse-flow cylinder head promotes better mixing and hence better scavenging of the end gas. The fact that the inlet charge must change direction before going out the exhaust makes it less likely that fresh mixture will make it out the exhaust before mixing during overlap. Overall this improves volumetric efficiency and reduces emissions.  Forced induction  When forced induction is used, large port flow is not as important as it is when an engine is naturally aspirated. This means that the generally inferior flow of a reverse-flow head is less of a disadvantage. In the early days of turbo charging a reverse-flow head allowed the compressor outlet of a turbocharger to blow directly into the inlet manifold with either a blow-through or draw-through carburettor and no intercooler. This allowed the use of shorter inlet plumbing which decreased turbo lag and lowered flow restriction. Modern turbocharged configurations utilizing intercoolers and fuel injection are more difficult to plumb up to a reverse-flow head and are ideally suited to a cross flow head where the turbo is on the exhaust side of the engine, the charge crosses through an intercooler in front of the engine and into the inlet manifold on the other side.  Summary of uses  The reverse flow head was ideally suited to a production carbureted engine due to its low rpm performance and ease of manufacture. The design could be modified for high performance by porting (in particular siamese) and isolating the inlet manifold from the exhaust header. The configuration is also perfect for carbureted non-intercooled turbo- charging. However, the advent of fuel injection and electronic ignition has made most of the reverse-flow head's advantages redundant in a modern engine and as a result the design has lost its popularity. The reverse-flow head still enjoys some popularity among enthusiasts including Leyland Mini, Chrysler Slant-6, Holden and Ford Inline 6 fans. In fact some Australian Ford enthusiasts consider the 250 2V reverse-flow head to be superior to the Honda designed cross-flow head that replaced it.

It is notable for having been the home of author and occultist Aleister Crowley, and Led Zeppelin guitarist and producer Jimmy Page. It suffered significant fire damage in December 2015 and again in July 2019. The house is now being restored and construction work has started as of December 2019. The Boleskine House Foundation SCIO took over ownership of one part of the estate in 2019 in order to manage restoration efforts on the house. Background Boleskine Cemetery in 2007 Boleskine House is south of Inverness, on the opposite side of Loch Ness from the Meall Fuar-mhonaidh, and halfway between the villages of Foyers and Inverfarigaig. The area has a history of strange happenings long before Aleister Crowley moved in. The parish of Boleskine was formed in the 13th Century. A Kirk and graveyard were built in the parish around this time. A succession of Ministers ran Boleskine Parish and would travel the area on horseback or on foot in all weather conditions. Minister Thomas Houston (1648‚Äì1705) was said to have had the task of hastily laying animated corpses back in their graves after a devious local wizard had raised the dead in Boleskine graveyard. Boleskine House was built on the site of the kirk, which, according to legend, caught fire during congregation and killed everyone inside. The house was constructed in the 1760s by Colonel Archibald Fraser as a hunting lodge. Colonel Archibald Fraser apparently chose the site specifically to irritate Simon Fraser of Lovat in retribution for his support of the English side during the Jacobite rising of 1745 as Lord Lovat's land surrounded the site of Boleskine. The original hunting lodge was expanded continuously by the Fraser family until c. 1830\\\\. All the rooms were situated on one floor, with 4 bedrooms, a kitchen, servant's \\"attic bedroom\\" (above kitchen), lounge, drawing room, and a library. There is even a tunnel linking the house to the graveyard. Boleskine Mortuary House in the graveyard in 2002 Aleister Crowley's ownership (1899‚Äì1913) Crowley in ceremonial garb, 1912 Crowley purchased Boleskine House from the Fraser family in 1899. The House at that time was known as the Manor of Boleskine and Abertarff after the name of the local parish.Confessions. ibidem. Crowley believed the location was ideal to sequester himself to perform a series of operations known as the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, taken from a grimoire called The Book of Abramelin.Symonds J, Grant K (eds), The Confessions of Aleister Crowley Penguin 1979:184The Book of Abramelin According to Crowley, in his book The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, in order to perform the operations \\"the first essential is a house in a more or less secluded situation. There should be a door opening to the north from the room of which you make your oratory. Outside this door, you construct a terrace covered with fine river sand. This ends in a 'lodge' where the spirits may congregate.\\" The purpose of this ritual is to invoke one's Guardian Angel. It requires at least 6 months of preparation, celibacy and abstinence from alcohol. However, it also includes the summoning of the 12 Kings and Dukes of Hell, to bind them and remove their negative influences from the magician's life. Whilst Crowley was in the process of performing the lengthy ritual, he was called to Paris by the leader of the Golden Dawn. According to legend, he never banished the demons he had summoned, leading to strange happenings occurring in and around Boleskine House. Crowley became infamous for stories of conducting black magic and various other rituals while residing at the house; one of his pseudonyms was \\"Lord Boleskine\\". His lodge keeper, Hugh Gillies, suffered a number of personal tragedies, including the loss of two children. Crowley later claimed that his experiments with black magic had simply got out of hand. Crowley described the house as a \\"long low building. I set apart the south-western half for my work. The largest room has a bow window and here I made my door and constructed the terrace and lodge. Inside the room I set up my oratory proper. This was a wooden structure, lined in part with the big mirrors which I brought from London.\\" He left the property in 1913, moving to a modest cottage for sometime in Dennyloanhead near Falkirk. 1913‚Äì1970 After the First World War, Hollywood actor George Raft was involved in a scandal selling shares for a pig farm supposedly built on the grounds of Boleskine‚Äîexcept the farm did not exist. After the Second World War the house was owned by a Major Edward Grant. In 1965, Grant committed suicide in Crowley's bedroom with a shotgun. After this a newly married couple moved into the house. The wife was blind, and after a month the man walked out, leaving the woman wandering around unable to see. In 1969 Kenneth Anger, an experimental filmmaker with an interest in the occult, learned that the house was on the market and rented it for a few months. When Jimmy Page heard about this, he bought the house in 1970. Jimmy Page's ownership (1970‚Äì1992) Jimmy Page in 2008 Jimmy Page was a collector of Crowley memorabilia who \\"had read a lot of Crowley and ... was fascinated by his ideas\\". At the time Page bought the house it was in a state of decay, but he felt it would be a good atmosphere in which to write songs. However, after arranging for the house to be restored he spent little time at Boleskine, leaving things in the care of his friend Malcolm Dent (1944-2011). When asked why he was chosen, Dent explained \\"Jimmy Page caught me at a time in my life when I wasn't doing a great deal and asked me to come up and run the place. I never did establish why he fixed on me.\\" When Dent moved into the house \\"it was a wreck ... It had been more or less abandoned. There'd been at least one fire there, parts of the building were missing and it had been badly patched up. The grounds, which at one time had been very nicely laid out were gone to hell\\". Although Dent was a sceptic of the paranormal he soon started to experience strange occurrences. After a few weeks, he heard strange rumblings from the hallway which stopped when he investigated, but resumed after he closed the bedroom door. After researching the house he discovered the rumbling in the hall was supposedly the head of Lord Lovat, even though he was executed in London. Dent explains \\"above Boleskine there's a place called Errogie which is supposed to be the geographical centre of the Highlands. Boleskine was then the nearest consecrated ground to Errogie and it's thought his soul, or part of it, ended here.\\" Dent also experienced the \\"most terrifying night of my life\\" at Boleskine. He awoke one night to hear what sounded like a wild animal snorting and banging outside his bedroom door. It went on for some time and it was not until morning that Dent dared open the door, and there was nothing there. Dent added \\"whatever was there was pure evil.\\" Another friend who stayed at Boleskine awoke one night claiming she had been attacked by \\"some kind of devil\\". Other occurrences, such as chairs switching places, doors slamming open and closed for no reason and carpets and rugs rolling up inexplicably, failed to deter Dent from staying. Dent met his wife at Boleskine and raised his family there. Although Jimmy Page never spent a great length of time there, he did everything he could to return the house to how it would have looked during Crowley's ownership. For example, he commissioned an artist, Charles Pace, to paint some Crowley-esque murals on the walls. These were based on the murals in Crowley's Abbey of Thelema in Sicily discovered by Kenneth Anger in 1955. MacGillivray family (1992‚Äì2002) The house was put on the market for ¬£250,000 in 1991. It was purchased by Ronald and Annette MacGillivray in 1992. According to Mrs. MacGillivray, when they bought the house it was in a very bad state. The MacGillivrays \\"spent a lot of money stripping it back to the bare walls and re-roofing it. It had four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a huge drawing room, dining room, library and various smaller rooms\\". The house was then converted into a hotel. Ronald MacGillivray died in 2002. He was said to hate any reference to the house's dark past when it was home to Crowley. When asked whether she had experienced any mysterious occurrences at Boleskine House, his wife states that she experienced \\"absolutely none. I am a non-believer and didn't listen to all that rubbish. We had a great time there.\\" Private ownership (2002‚Äì2015) Following Ronald MacGillivray's death, Boleskine House was put up for sale again. The new Dutch owners, who have remained anonymous, converted the house back into a private residence and used it as a holiday home. In 2009, a plot on the former estate was put on the market for ¬£176,000 with plans to build a three-bedroom log house. The sale also included of foreshore on Loch Ness. Conflagration (2015) At approximately 1:40 pm on 23 December 2015, a motorist on the A82 road reported flames and smoke coming from Boleskine House. When fire crews attended, it is estimated up to 60 per cent of the building had already been incinerated, with flames rising up to high. The firefighters concentrated on the west wing of the house, as the rest of the building had been severely damaged. The owner's partner and daughter had gone shopping and returned to find the house ablaze. The fire was thought to have started in the kitchen, however nobody was believed to be in the house at the time of the fire and there were no casualties. Today The interior of the house was almost totally destroyed by the fires. Part of the roof and the outer walls survive, but the former owner, Mrs. MacGillivray, has said that since the extent of the damage is so bad it \\"is unlikely it will ever be rebuilt unless there is someone out there with an interest in the occult wanting to spend a lot of money.\\" The ruins and 22 acres of land were put on the market for ¬£500,000 in April 2019. They are now owned by the Boleskine House Foundation SCIO which will restore the house and gardens to their original form and then open the estate to the public. The website with plans for the project is here - https://www.boleskinehouse.org. A further fire was started on 31 July 2019 in two buildings on the estate at the same time in a suspected arson. The police are currently appealing to the public for any information on those involved. The fire destroyed the remainder of what was left inside Boleskine House and as of December 2019 work is underway to clear the fire damaged material and prepare the building for a new roof. Boleskine House is a Category B listed building, as are the adjacent stables and gate lodge. In literature Boleskine House is described and recognisable in W. Somerset Maugham's The Magician where it is called \\"Skene\\". Crowley considered Maugham's book to be plagiarism and wrote an article under the name of Oliver Haddo (the name of a character taken from Maugham's book) for Vanity Fair as a witty riposte. (For details, see Crowley's autobiography, Confessions, listed above.) In Neil Spring's novel The Burning House the house plays a major role.

The characters have strong ties to the Hellfire Club. They first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #281 and were created by Jim Lee and Whilce Portacio. Fictional team biography The Upstarts were part of a secret competition founded by Selene, the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club, who wanted to test potential members for her own Inner Circle. Overseen by the Gamesmaster, the Upstarts would each try to kill as many mutants as possible and the Gamesmaster would award points based on the mutant's power, skills and general importance in the world. At times he would raise the value of certain mutants so that the Upstarts would all try to assassinate them. At other times Gamesmaster would also reward the death of non-mutants. To gain entry to the Upstarts competition the requirement was to kill a member of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, but later members were not required to do so; usually the Gamesmaster claimed that their participation would make the game more interesting. The member with the most points at the end of the competition would win \\"the prize\\". It was never explicitly stated what the prize was (though a statement by Andrea Strucker in X-Men #4 and a notation on the back of the Upstarts' X-Men Series I trading card state that the prize was immortality), but it was inferred that the winner would gain control over the other contestants as well as gain a lot of power and influence. Shinobi Shaw took the early lead by killing his father Sebastian Shaw. He celebrated with a group of contestants who were never seen again afterwards. The time-traveller Trevor Fitzroy gained membership with the deaths of Donald Pierce and the Reavers. He demanded the ring that signified leadership of the Upstarts from Shaw, but Shaw refused, claiming that he still had more points. Fitzroy would go on to kill the Hellions, but Fabian Cortez applied for membership and immediately took first place in the competition for the death of Magneto. The German twins Fenris tried to join the competition and gain an advantage by resurrecting Omega Red. Their plan failed though and they were named only probational members by the Gamesmaster. Graydon Creed joined as well, using the moniker Tribune, and despite not succeeding killing anyone, the Gamesmaster gave him full membership. Trevor Fitzroy had met a woman in the future, named Sienna Blaze, who had told him where she would be one day. Fitzroy knew that Blaze had incredible mutant powers and told her that the Gamesmaster invited her to join the Upstarts. Over the next few months, the Upstarts would try to kill as many mutants and other important people (like Moira MacTaggert) as possible, but with no success. In an attempt to reinvigorate the competition, the Gamesmaster started the Younghunt: the new targets were all surviving members of the New Mutants and Hellions. Instead of killing them, the Gamesmaster demanded that they should capture the targets. This competition brought the Upstarts into conflict with the New Warriors and X-Force. At the end of the game, the Upstarts had captured most of their targets, but Paige Guthrie convinced the Gamesmaster to play another game: instead of killing mutants, the Upstarts should try to find and train young mutants like herself. The Gamesmaster was intrigued and cancelled the competition. The Upstarts disbanded shortly afterwards. =Reemergence= Years later the Upstarts resurfaced to start the game that they created long ago. This new incarnation was made of long deceased mutants, Fabian Cortez, Shinobi Shaw, Siena Blaze and Trevor Fitzroy. They killed members of the Nasty Boys in order to lure out Cyclops and his ragtag team of X-Men to Washington Heights. After a brief moment of words, the two groups engaged each other in battle. The X-Men gained the upperhand as the Upstarts retreated but Shinobi was left behind. Not wanting to get captured, Shaw mentioned that he wasn't going to be controlled by the Hellfire Club so he phased his hand into head and then solidified it resulting in his death.Uncanny X-Men (Vol. 5) #20 Members * Gamesmaster (arbiter): An omnipath, who was in constant telepathic contact with the complete human population. To stop himself from going insane, he needed a distraction and became the judge of the competition. * Selene: Came up with the idea of the Upstarts to use them against the other members of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle and then choose the best to form a new Inner Circle. However, Fitzroy captured and tortured her to gain the attention of the Gamesmaster, therefore ruining her plans to reform the Inner Circle. * Fabian Cortez: Gained points for the death of Magneto, but he lost his points when Magneto turned out to be alive. He left the competition shortly afterwards when Exodus nearly killed him. * Shinobi Shaw: Gained points for the death of his father Sebastian Shaw. By the time of the Younghunt he was no longer interested in the competition and used Justice as his agent. * Trevor Fitzroy: Gained points for the deaths of Donald Pierce, the Reavers and the Hellions. He also claimed points for Emma Frost, but the Gamesmaster didn't award them, because Frost was in a coma and not dead. * Siena Blaze: Gained points for an attempt to kill Cyclops, Professor X and Storm, despite failing to actually kill them. * Tribune (Graydon Creed): Tried to kill Sabretooth and Mystique for personal reasons, but failed. Received no points in the competition. * Fenris (probational members): Had two unsuccessful attempts to join. During the Younghunt they tried to capture Wolfsbane, but were captured by X-Factor. Notes * In early appearances, Shinobi Shaw has a group of people with him, whom he calls the Upstarts. These people are not seen again and never took any action in the competition. * Nearly all the Upstarts' victims have since returned alive; only the Hellions remain dead (except for Tarot) * At whatever point the Upstarts' competition was to be completed and a final winner declared, Selene had promised to the winner the prize of immortality. * While not technically a member, Matsu'o Tsurayaba once petitioned the Gamesmaster for the right to kill Psylocke, which he was granted (to the chagrin of Shinobi Shaw). This was most likely an attempt by Tsurayaba to keep her alive until he could fully restore his lover, Kwannon, whose body had been switched with Psylocke's at the time.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 96 north of the Monroe County village of Pittsford. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 31 in the Wayne County village of Macedon. Along the way, NY 31F serves the villages of East Rochester and Fairport and connects to Interstate 490 (I-490) in the town of Pittsford. From Fairport eastward, NY 31F roughly parallels the Erie Canal, which the route crosses over twice: once west of Fairport and again north of Macedon. The origins of NY 31F date back to 1908 when the modern alignment of the route was designated as part of Route 20 by the New York State Legislature. Route 20, an unsigned legislative route, was rerouted in 1921 to use NY 31 and NY 250 between Macedon and Fairport instead. The section of Route 20's pre-1921 alignment west of modern NY 350 received a designation when it became part of New York State Route 33B, an alternate route of NY 33 (now NY 441) that extended from Pittsford to Walworth via Macedon Center. NY 33 was truncated to end in Rochester in 1949, at which time NY 33B was renumbered to NY 31F and rerouted to end in Macedon. Route description Western terminus of NY 31F at NY 96 Upon separating from NY 96 in the town of Pittsford directly in front of St. John Fisher College, NY 31F becomes Fairport Road, the name that the route dons for its first . The highway, four lanes wide, heads east, skirting the southern edge of the St. John Fisher campus for a half-mile (0.8 km) before connecting to I-490 at exit 25\\\\. Past the expressway, NY 31F begins to straddle the boundary line between the village of East Rochester and the town of Pittsford. After intersecting NY 153, the primary roadway linking East Rochester and the village of Pittsford, NY 31F passes to the south of the East Rochester Union Free School District campus prior to leaving the vicinity of the village and entering Perinton. Within Perinton, the route initially passes through residential areas similar to those located in East Rochester and Pittsford but soon enters a heavily commercial area centered on the intersection between NY 31F and Jefferson Avenue. During this stretch, the route passes under the CSX Transportation- owned West Shore Subdivision railroad line, here situated on a large embankment. At the eastern edge of the commercial strip, NY 31F narrows to two lanes and crosses over the Erie Canal into Fairport, where it becomes West Church Street. NY 31F eastbound at NY 250 in Fairport NY 31F continues through the residential western portion of the village to an intersection with NY 250 (South Main Street) just south of the village's business district and adjacent to the First Baptist Church of Fairport. After crossing NY 250, NY 31F becomes East Church Street and begins to parallel the canal as both exit the village. Now solely in Perinton once more, NY 31F cuts to the north along Turk Hill Road, crossing the Erie Canal and the Rochester Subdivision, CSX's main line through the Rochester area, on a large overpass. The route resumes its eastward path at an intersection with High Street in the northeast corner of the village, becoming Macedon Center Road in the process. East of Fairport, the route becomes predominantly rural in nature in a stark departure from its first . NY 31F heads east on a nearly-linear routing through eastern Perinton and the Wayne County town of Macedon to the hamlet of Macedon Center, located at the junction of NY 31F and Canandaigua Road. Not long after, NY 31F encounters NY 350\\\\. Here, NY 31F and NY 350 turn south, concurrently following Ontario Center Road for to the village of Macedon, where both NY 31F and NY 350 terminate at NY 31\\\\. During this final stretch, NY 31F passes under the CSX main line and over the Erie Canal once again. Maintenance of NY 31F is split between the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), the village of Fairport, and Monroe County. The highway is state-maintained from NY 96 east to the Fairport village line, at which point ownership and maintenance of the road shifts to the village. NY 31F becomes a state highway once again at NY 250 and remains NYSDOT-maintained until it turns north onto the county-owned and maintained Turk Hill Road. While on Turk Hill Road, NY 31F overlaps with County Route 50, the designation assigned to the entire length of Turk Hill Road within Monroe County. The remainder of NY 31F east of Turk Hill Road is state-maintained. History reference marker alongside the road erroneously reads \\"253\\" for NY 253 All of what is now NY 31F was originally designated as part of Route 20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route 20 entered the village of Macedon on modern NY 31 and continued westward to Rochester on current NY 96. On March 1, 1921, Route 20 was realigned to utilize modern NY 31 and NY 250 between Macedon and Fairport. Although all of modern NY 31F was part of a legislative route at one time and was state-maintained west of Fairport and from Macedon Center to Macedon by 1926, it was not assigned a posted route number until the 1930s. The portion of current NY 31F west of NY 350 in the town of Macedon was designated as part of NY 33B . NY 33B continued north from Macedon on modern NY 350 to an intersection with NY 33 (now NY 441) in Walworth. NY 350 was assigned by the following year; however, it was initially confined to the segment it now shares with NY 31F between NY 31 in the village of Macedon and then-NY 33B. NY 350 was extended northward to Ontario Center in the early 1940s, overlapping NY 33B from Macedon to Walworth. NY 33 was truncated westward to Rochester on January 1, 1949. As a result, NY 33B was renumbered to NY 31F and rerouted east of Macedon Center to travel south along NY 350 to Macedon, where it connected to NY 31. The first section of the Eastern Expressway (now I-490) opened in November 1955 extending from NY 31F south to NY 96 in Bushnell's Basin. Initially, NY 96 was realigned to follow the freeway between the two locations and Fairport Road between the north end of the freeway and its original routing on East Avenue. As a result, NY 31F was truncated to begin at the new freeway. The latter change was short-lived, however, as NY 31F was re-extended to its original terminus after NY 96 was moved onto a northwestern extension of the Eastern Expressway to what is now the Can of Worms in Rochester. NY 31F originally ran through the center of Fairport, turning north at NY 250 and sharing Main Street with NY 250 on a short concurrency between Church Street and High Street. NY 31F turned east at High Street and followed it to Turk Hill Road, where NY 31F continued east on its current alignment. The route was realigned onto its current alignment through Fairport on April 1, 1984, as a result of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and the village of Fairport. In the swap, ownership and maintenance of High Street was transferred from the state to Fairport in exchange for control over the portion of East Church Street between NY 250 and Turk Hill Road.

As of the 2001 Census, the population was recorded as 2,829, reducing to 2,768 at the 2011 Census. The community is bordered by the communities of: Llanddarog; Gorslas; Llannon; Llanelli Rural; and Llangyndeyrn, all being in Carmarthenshire.  History  The village grew during the late 19th century and early 20th century with the growth of the coal mining industry in the area. There were four principal mines in the Pontyberem Area; Pontyberem colliery which was opened in 1845, Pentremawr (1889‚Äì), Glynhebog (1892‚Äì1949) and Gwendraeth colliery (Watney pit). It was in the Gwendraeth colliery (Watney pit)in 1852 that a terrible disaster took place : 26 men and boys died when water flooded the mine killing all the miners on the night shift. It is said that it took 18 months to recover the bodies .Photo Due to the demise of the coal industry in the South Wales Coalfield, there are now no high quality anthracite coal mines operating in the Gwendraeth Valley. Between 1909 and 1953 Pontyberem station on what had been the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway, served the miners and the residents of the village and locality. The renowned Pontyberem safety lamps were made by John Jones (1879‚Äì1976) who worked as Colliery Chief Mechanic at Pentremawr Colliery.Mining-Memorabilia http://www.mining-memorabilia.co.uk/Pontyberem-Part%20II.htm The name Pontyberem originates from three separate Welsh language words, pont meaning bridge, aber meaning mouth of a river (into the sea), estuary, confluence of a lesser with a larger river and Beran after Nant Beran the river that flows through Pontyberem .BBC - Wales - What's in a name - Pontyberem > 'Although not immediately obvious the element aber once formed part of this > place name and referred to the location of the pont (bridge) over the river > Gwendraeth Fawr just below its confluence with Nant Beran. It was probably > lost through the contraction of aber and the river name Beran. The -a- of > aber was then interpreted as the definite article y and Beran was probably > influenced by berem, a variant of burum (yeast).' Local people understand the name Pontyberem to originate from a simple combination of words. The 'Berem' refers to the frothy buildup (like yeast) on the surface of the water of the Nant Beran, especially near the bridge (Pont) over the Gwendraeth Fawr.  Welsh Language  The Welsh language is spoken widely in Pontyberem. In 1991 Pontyberem was recorded as having, with Quarter Bach, the highest levels of Welsh speakers in Carmarthenshire. According to the 2001 Census, 81.28% (1961:91% :1991:80.5%) of the population have one or more skills in Welsh with 60.83% able to speak, read and write it. In a survey conducted by Mori for Carmarthenshire County Council in 2000 people were asked how well they spoke Welsh. In the Gwendraeth valley 47% said very well, 17% said fairly well, 10% said not very well with 25% saying not at all. Menter Cwm Gwendraeth, the first community Welsh language initiative is based at Pontyberem. Menter Cwm Gwendraeth started in 1991 following the successful Urdd Gobaith Cymru and National Eisteddfod held in the Gwendraeth Valley. Both primary schools in Pontyberem, Pontyberem Primary School and Bancffosfelen Primary School, are Category A schools where the majority of the curriculum is taught through the medium of Welsh.

Novgorodian pirates who operated along the Volga River from the 12th-15th century. Map of present-day Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia Novgorodian Ushkuyniks from Veliky Novgorod captured Kostroma. Date 16th century The Ushkuyniks (), also Ushkuiniks or Russian pirates were free and democratic people from early Rus' state which originated in northern regions of Russia, medieval Novgorod, composed of Slavic people like the Ilmen Slavs or Novgorod Slovenes, Finno-Ugrics and Vikings who supposedly led the Viking-like life of fighting, killing, and robbery. The Ushkuyniks were widespread in large parts of the Russian north and sailed on the arctic ocean. The origin of the term Ushkuyniks is unknown. Most likely the word \\"ushkuy\\" derives from the Oskuya River in Russia. Most likely the term is also connected to the Russian word for tight or narrow, —É–∑–∫–æ (usko), —É–∑–∫–∏–π (uzkiy or uzkij), plural: —É–∑–∫–∏–µ (uzkiye). Furthermore medieval Finnic type of flat-bottom ships are called uisk (literally a 'snake'). In Eastern Slavic languages word \\"Uzh\\" (—É–∂) translates natrix (type of snake), and it was common for Norsemen to sail on narrow longships called \\"drakkar\\", which roughly translates as \\"serpent\\" from Old Norse. This translation of information shows a cultural connection between Northern Europeans. These ships could be easily transported over portages between watersheds, is also considered as the namesake. Although the Novgorodians took part in the Tsargrad expeditions of the 10th century and mounted pillaging raids to Finland in the 12th century (compare Swedish‚ÄìNovgorodian Wars), the Ushkuyniks first appear in the historical record as an organized force in the 1320s. Arranged in squadrons which could number several thousand, the Ushkuyniks enjoyed the patronage of influential boyar families of Novgorod, who used them to demonstrate Novgorod's military clout to its neighbours and to advance its trade interests and influence along the Volga river and its Rusƒ≠ or Rusy regions. Balkan Narentines, of the ninth and tenth centuries were known for piracy on the River Neretva. The Ushkuyniks were Russian Novgorodian Volga river pirates from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries. Both medieval river pirate groups were Slavic versions of Viking river raiders.alt=left During the famous campaign of 1360, the ushkuiniks sailed from Novgorod by the portages to the Volga river. Under command of boyar Anfal Nikitin, they gained possession of Zhukotin, a trade emporium in Volga Bulgaria. A ruler of the Golden Horde, which controlled Zhukotin, was furious and ordered Grand Prince Dmitry Konstantinovich to capture the Ushkuiniks and to bring them to the Horde for trial, but Dmitry's punitive expedition failed. In 1363 the pirates launched the first Novgorodian raid along the Ob River in western Siberia. Three years later, without consulting their superiors in Novgorod, they approached Nizhny Novgorod and, wishing to punish Dmitry for his hostile action, massacred Armenian and Tatar merchants trading there. This led to a diplomatic row, when Dmitry demanded apologies from Novgorod Republic. In 1371 the Ushkuiniks sacked Yaroslavl, Kostroma and other Upper Volga cities. Three years later they sailed with upwards of ninety ships to pillage the Vyatka region. In 1375, they defeated the militia of Kostroma and burnt the city to the ground. The destruction was so severe that Kostroma had to be rebuilt elsewhere. After that, they looted Nizhny Novgorod and sailed down the Volga to Astrakhan, where they were annihilated by a Tatar general. By 1391 the Ushkuiniks had recovered from this reverse and felt strong enough to resume their activities. At that period their patrons included Narimantas and Patrikas, the overlords of the Korela district that later became known as Ingria. In 1391 the pirates sacked both Zhukotin and Kazan. With Muscovy's power on the ascendant, however, Novgorod Republic was pressed into putting down their filibustering activities in the first decades of the 15th century.

He was a co-founder of the Canadian Psychological Association and the appointed Chairman of the Alberta Eugenics Board which was responsible for approving the sterilization of thousands of Albertans, hundreds of which were without consent. Early years (1877-1909) John Malcolm MacEachran was born in Glencoe, Ontario in Canada to David and Christina MacEachran. After finishing his primary education in the public school system of Glencoe, he was admitted to Queen's University in Ontario. There, MacEachran obtained an MA in Mental and Moral Philosophy (1902), became the appointed assistant to Professor John Watson, and obtained his first PhD in 1906. Following his apprenticeship, MacEachran traveled to Berlin, Germany, where he worked with the well-known scholars Friedrich Paulsen and Carl Stumpf, further increasing his knowledge of modern psychology, ethics, and the philosophy of education. MacEachran then officially commenced schooling in Germany where he became a student of the psychologist/philosopher Wilhelm Wundt at the Leipzig University (1907). Here he wrote his doctoral thesis Der Pragmatismus (1909) earning him his second PhD. MacEachran then traveled to Paris where he studied sociology under √âmile Durkheim and took a class under Alfred Binet, who had recently developed the IQ test (1908). MacEachran's academic relationship with Henri Bergson spurred his interest in combining the disciplines of philosophy and biological science. Dr. MacEachran accepted an offer from the then newly founded University of Alberta to head its Department of Philosophy and Psychology in 1909.Greene, B. M., editor. (1945-46) Who's Who in Canada.

(1971) New Trail, 27(4):26 University of Alberta years (1909-1945) In 1909, J.M. MacEachran was appointed head of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Alberta. As the head of a new department, MacEachran fabricated the curriculum from scratch and in his first year at the U of A, MacEachran offered introductory courses in experimental and modern psychology.Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc. Toronto. 1982.p. 192-97 As the program developed, MacEachran made junior and senior level courses available and in 1911, he made it possible to graduate with a M.A and B.A in the field of psychology. Other classes that were added to the curriculum included: psychology and logic, comparative psychology (animal evolution, child psychology and racial psychology), physiological psychology, abnormal psychology and psychology of religion. At this point, MacEachran had developed and supported the whole of the undergraduate philosophy and psychology programs and supervised at least one Masters level student. He MacEachran also began administrative duties for the university in 1911, and officially accepted the position as the University of Alberta's first Provost in 1912. All of these responsibilities earned him a salary of $4,900.Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc. Toronto. 1982, p. 192-97 During the First World War (1916-1918), J.M. MacEachran enlisted as captain in the 196th Western Universities Battalion on March 15, 1916. He also served with the 19th Reserve Battalion, the C.E.F. Young Soldiers' Battalion, and the 13th Brigade C.F. in France. After MacEachran's return to the University of Alberta after World War I (1918), a central focus was developing applied psychology. Courses such as applied psychology, educational psychology, industrial psychology, legal psychology and psychology and economic problems were introduced into the curriculum. While studying at Leipzig University, Wilhelm Wundt lectured to MacEachran that experimental psychology would have to be meticulously studied for two or three centuries before it was to be applied ‚Äì MacEachran installed applied psychology at the University of Alberta only one decade later.Wright M.J., and C.R.

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, laboratory psychology was crafted. In August 1945, after shaping the Department of Philosophy and Psychology, and much of the Universities' administrative routine, MacEachran retired as Emeritus Professor of Philosophy. His successor was John MacDonald.Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc.

MacEachran was appointed Head of Alberta Eugenics Board in 1928, immediately after the Alberta government enacted the Sexual Sterilization Act. MacEachran was appointed Chairman for the purpose of developing a philosophical justification for the eugenics movement. He was an ideal candidate for the position because of his extensive background in philosophy and psychology.Nelson, T. M. (1982) Psychology at Alberta. In M. J. Wright and C. R. Myers, editors, History of Academic Psychology in Canada. Toronto: C. J. Hogrefe. pp. 192-219 (p.200) The purpose of the Alberta Eugenics board is outlined in section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act: > Section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act empowered the medical > superintendent of a mental hospital to cause a patient of the mental > hospital whom it proposed to discharge to be examined by or in the presence > of the eugenics board, with a view to sterilization. Section 5 of the Act > established two grounds for sterilization: that procreation by the person > under consideration would result in the transmission of any mental > disability or deficiency to his or her progeny or involved the risk of > mental injury either to such a person or his or her progeny.Muir v.

MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p. 2 Five years after the first meeting of the Alberta Eugenics Board in 1929, at the annual meeting of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) in 1934, it was noted that 288 cases had been approved by the Eugenics Board for sterilization, and that 60% of these cases involved serious mental or nervous disease in the patients family record. Two classes of individuals were sterilized - those with low mental IQ's and those who had suffered serious mental breakdowns, and therefore could not be recommended for parenthood by any physician. It was also noted that any operations to be completed on the patients first required personal consent, or consent from family. If no one was eligible to provide consent and the patient was not capable of signing personal consent due to physical or mental barriers, the Minister of Health could do so. In 1933, the Eugenics Board consented that the Chairman, Dr. MacEachran, would have the authority to dictate when an operation for sterilization would take place.Jana Marie Grekul.

In 1937, the Social Credit government passed an amendment that strongly restricted the need for the Eugenics Board to obtain the consent of the patients to be sterilized.Pringle, H. Alberta barren. Saturday Night, June, 1997, pp. 30-74 This increased the efficiency of the sterilization process, as more patients could be approved for sterilization by the Eugenics board. In the 44 years that the board was empowered by the government of Alberta, 2822 sterilizations were processed.Robertson in Muir v. Alberta, 232 MacEachran resigned from Chairman of the Alberta Eugenics Board on June 30, 1965, serving for 38 consecutive years. During his term as Chairman, MacEachran signed over 3200 applications approving for sterilization of adults and children (~60% of approvals resulted in sterilizations). His successor was R.K. Thomson who was chairman until 1972 when the Sexual Sterilization Act was repealed.Jana Marie Grekul.

(1975, March 12). New lecture series established at University. UA News Release (University of Alberta) Every year a distinguished scholar of psychology would be invited to give a lecture to students and faculty in MacEachran's honor. Awards and scholarships were also distributed in MacEachran's honour, first in 1958 and then 1972 with endowments from his estate. After 1972, the Faculty of Education and the Departments of Philosophy and Psychology awarded annual scholarships to students honouring MacEachran's accomplishments. On September 3, 1997, a committee at the University of Alberta voted to rename the lecture series due to MacEachran's involvement in the unlawful sterilization of many Albertans.Agenda and minutes for the 69th Council Meeting. (1997, September 3). The University of Alberta, Department of Psychology In 1998, a University of Alberta panel submitted a request to halt the distribution of awards in J.M. MacEachran's name.Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 1 This request was based on data obtained from the Leilani Muir versus the Province of Alberta trial, which showed that many of the sterilizations were unlawfully approved by the Alberta Eugenics Board. The board, headed by J.M. MacEachran, approved sterilizations without clear evidence that the patient's deficiencies would be transmitted to their progeny.Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 3 The board approved sterilizations of patients who did not fall into the category of \\"mentally defective\\". A section of the Sterilization Act stated that upon sterilization, the patient would be discharged from the holding facility and in many instances, patients were sterilized even though discharge was not imminent. The board also approved the sterilization of patients already known to be infertile (patients with Down Syndrome). Furthermore, castrations were approved in order to obtain testicular tissue for research purposes. The board approved sterilizations with the understanding that patient's sexual behaviour would be altered, therefore eliminating sexual deviancy,Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 4 and also with the goal of stopping menstruation in women. MacEachran had also signed application forms, approving sterilization before the patients had been interviewed by the board.Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 6 With regards to the Leilani Muir vs. Alberta trial, Madame Justice Joanne B. Veit noted: > Dr. Thompson's [a former chair holder of the Alberta Eugenics Board] > evidence demonstrates that the operations of the Board initiated on a > purported scientific rationale, degenerated into unscientific practices. The > decisions of the Board were not made according to the standards imposed on > them by the legislation, but because the members of the Board... thought > that it was socially appropriate to control reproduction of \\"these > people\\".Muir v. Alberta, 215 Because of the previously stated reasons, in 1998, the Department of Philosophy at the University of Alberta stopped giving out rewards honouring MacEachran's name. A single MacEachran award was given out in 2003 from the Department of Philosophy, and then no more thereafter.

Taylor, in conjunction with financial management firm Merrill Lynch. Launched on November 30, 1981, the channel was bought by NBC in February 1991, and had its operations integrated with rival cable financial news network, the Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC), on May 21, 1991. Early history =Founding= Financial News Network (FNN) was co-founded in 1981 by Glen Taylor, Chairman, Karen Tyler Head of Production, Rob Fisher, VP Business Affairs, and Rodney Buchser (who had been general manager of independent station KWHY-TV in Los Angeles. The concept originated in the late 1960s as Quotron (a quotation ticker vendor) supported WCIU Chicago and KWHY with the initial limited 'ticker scroll'. In 1969, Registered Investment Advisor Eugene Inger, joined Channel 22, and expanded financial television in Los Angeles with reporting, analysis and broader coverage. Inger expanded service to the San Francisco area in 1970 on KOFY, Channel 20. He also provided financial TV programming to KDNL in St. Louis, and pioneered WKID Channel 51 serving South Florida. During this time, FNN began programing on Channel 18 in Los Angeles in competition with Inger and KWHY. Later, in 1975 via Newark, New Jersey-based WBTB (later WWHT)-TV (channel 68, now UniM√°s owned-and-operated station WFUT-DT), an independent station ‚Äì owned at the time by Blonder-Tongue Broadcasting ‚Äì which served the New York City market, was 'dark'. Inger revived the station by investing in Channel 68, and served as General Manager, as well as hosting a daily Wall Street programming block on WBTB (then titled Stock Market Today during market hours'and Wall Street Perspective in the evening) starting in the fall of 1975. Keith Houser, the station's assistant general manager, worked with vendors to facilitate the ticker tape crawl across the bottom of the screen with a delay (mistakenly attributed at a 2 hour delay in a TV Guide reference), as was required at the time. The ticker ran across the lower third of the screen, with stock prices on the top (white) band and index prices on the bottom (blue) band. After the first year of programming, the SEC permitted just a twenty-minute delay.October, 1975 \\"TV Guide\\" article & 1976 FCC WBTB-TV Blonder-Tongue Broadcasting \\"Specialty Programming\\" Filings The concept was well-established both by WCIU Chicago, KWHY Los Angeles, Inger's day-long market coverage in Fort Lauderdale/ Miami. (The 'specialty programming' did not encounter regulatory hurtles TV Guide suggested.) During the years, FNN also grew affiliates that generally not overlapping Inger's targeted markets. However, Inger eventually ' \\"affiliated\\" with FNN, via an arrangement that took some programming and data feed from FNN, while retaining local coverage and interviews hosted on his station(s). The Chicago and Los Angeles stations evolved independently. KWHY was the first television station on the West Coast to offer daily market news accompanied by a digital stock ticker \\"crawl\\" at the bottom of the screen, followed by WCIU in Chicago, KEMO in San Francisco, and FNN on Los Angeles channel 18. All this allowed stock traders and investors to be able to stay on top of market action without subscribing to an expensive stock quotation service. Computers at that time could not keep up with the full stock feed and as such, the ticker could only show pre-selected stocks, making the system highly manual and clumsy. (The first fully automated stock ticker to appear on television would not be developed until 1996, for now-defunct upstart CNNfn.) Those were custom developments. Gene Inger's approach was simpler: take a feed from Reuters or UPI (both at times did contract to provide data feeds) and split-screen a camera shooting the tapes, with studio programming on the top portion. Inger was independent and never had a personal or corporate role with FNN, aside from limited mutual program affiliation later. Inger did however, become an original Market Maven contributor to CNBC, which effectively absorbed all financial programming over time; with competition years later from Bloomberg TV and Fox Business Channel. (Inger continued as a guest on CNBC for years; and provides a daily market analysis report online, continuing active as of 2019.) With the earlier launch of CNN by Ted Turner blazing the trail (Inger did provide the original stock market commentary to Ted Turner's WTBS Channel 17 Atlanta, Channel 36 Charlotte and Hubbard's Channel 44 Tampa); and subsequent to a 1975 TV Guide article about Gene Inger's programming success in New York, Taylor and Buchser realized that newly available technology made possible the marriage of KWHY / Inger-style live market reporting with on-screen quotes and the concept of national news via satellite. The early history of FNN was not highly profitable and, within a few years, Buchser severed his relationship with the fledgling network to launch a financial marketing services firm called FMS Direct. In its early years, FMS Direct produced infomercials and direct response television spots which more often than not, ran on FNN, the network he had helped to found. Harvey \\"Scott\\" Ellsworth, who was the creator and on- air host of the popular radio program Scott's Place, which aired on Los Angeles radio station KFI from 1967 until 1974 IMDB Bio, was one of FNN's initial anchors.FNN Staff citations and History =Private financing= FNN received its early private financing from Biotech Capital Corporation, which later changed its name to Infotechnology, Inc. Biotech Capital was also one of the few publicly held \\"Business Development Companies\\" - governed by the Business Company Development Act of 1980. In 1981, shortly before its initial public offering, led by the Paulson Investment Company, Taylor, then the Chairman, resigned due to previous legal difficulties. Jeremy Wiesen, a professor of business accounting and entrepreneurship at the Stern School of Business, New York University, and formerly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, became Chairman. The network's principal audience were small investors. FNN's principal studio was in Santa Monica, California, but it then established operations in New York, on the ground floor of Merrill Lynch's headquarters in Manhattan, where passersby could view its broadcast operations. Merrill Lynch was one of the initial private investors in FNN. =Over-the-air affiliates= At first, the channel aired only during daytime hours on a mix of broadcast stations and cable television providers. Over-the- air affiliates included: *KSCI, Los Angeles *WATL, Atlanta (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) *WPWR-TV, Chicago (now a CW affiliate) * KJTV (now KCIT), Amarillo (now a Fox affiliate) * KNXV, Phoenix (now an ABC affiliate) * WSWS, Columbus, Georgia (now Antenna TV affiliate WLGA) * KTWS (now KDFI), Dallas (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) * WKID (now WSCV), Miami/Ft.

At night, it began offering the Cable Sports Network, a venture between the Mizlou Television Network and Tom Ficara; this was subsequently replaced by SCORE, a mini-network that aired sports events and news. Also airing in the overnight hours was Venture, a series of long-form speeches by business leaders, and TelShop, a shop-at-home service. In the late 1980s, Infotechnology Inc., the New York-based information technology and venture capital company (chaired by Earl Brian) which also owned United Press International, increased its position to 47 percent, and remained one of FNN's largest shareholders until Earl Brian, the CEO of UPI and FNN, was later convicted on fraud charges specific to UPI and FNN. At its height, FNN was available on 3,500 cable systems, reaching a potential audience of 35 million homes across the country. FNN moved into newly built modern TV studios and production facilities in the Wang building in Los Angeles and in New York's Rockefeller Center. Later history =Financial scandals and accounting disputes= In 1990‚Äîonly months after beginning its biggest advertising campaign ever‚ÄîFNN fell prey to two of the main topics of its broadcasts, a financial scandal and an accounting dispute. During that year's audit, the network's auditor, Deloitte & Touche, discovered irregularities on the part of its chief financial officer, C. Steven Bolen. The irregularities were serious enough that Deloitte said its 1989 audit couldn't be relied upon. FNN launched an internal investigation and discovered what it called evidence of unauthorized payments that Bolen made to himself. Bolen was fired in October. In addition, Deloitte wanted FNN to report a $28 million investment into a data system for brokers as an expense. FNN claimed that this would push its balance sheet so far into the red that it would violate some covenants with its banks, as well as force a default on its line of credit. FNN replaced Deloitte with Coopers & Lybrand, and reported a $72.5 million loss for fiscal 1990. Needing a major cash infusion to stay in business, FNN put itself up for sale in November. =Proposed merger with CNBC= In February 1991, FNN reached a handshake agreement with a partnership of Dow Jones & Company and Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W) for $90 million. However, just a few days later, FNN agreed to an unexpected $105 million offer from NBC, owner of FNN's then two-year-old rival, CNBC. NBC had encountered problems getting cable systems to carry CNBC, and intended to merge CNBC with FNN (at the time, CNBC was only in 17 million homes). However, matters were complicated in March when FNN filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, triggering a lively bidding war for the network. Group W and Dow Jones raised their offer to $115 million, only to be turned down on a technicality by Bankruptcy Court Judge Francis Conrad; Dow Jones and Group W refused to keep the bidding open until May 31, 1991. NBC then raised its offer to $115 million, which was accepted by Conrad. That decision, however, was overturned on appeal. Group W/Dow Jones and CNBC both significantly raised their bids. Group W/Dow Jones offered $167 million, while CNBC offered $154 million. However, the CNBC bid included more cash, and the Dow Jones/Group W bid included payments that were tied to revenue targets over three years. Conrad awarded FNN to CNBC, feeling its deal was more realistic. =Closure= FNN ceased operations at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 21, 1991. CNBC immediately took over FNN's satellite transponder space, more than doubling its audience at one stroke, and branded its business day programming as \\"CNBC/FNN Daytime\\" until 1992; CNBC also effectively adopted the \\"look\\", news style of FNN as well as incorporated features of FNN's ticker into its own on-screen stock ticker. While most of FNN's employees were laid off as a consequence of the merger, a select number of FNN anchors and reporters (including Bill Griffeth, Ron Insana, Allan Chernoff and Joe Kernen) were retained by CNBC. (Sue Herera, who joined FNN at age 21 and very soon became an anchor, moved to NBC and the brand-new CNBC prior to the demise of FNN; Griffeth and Herera were later reunited at CNBC and co-anchored Power Lunch until 2011.)

Trams in Berlin, Germany. Electron T3L44 in Lviv, Ukraine Europe has an extensive number of tramway networks. Some of these networks have been upgraded to light rail standards, called Stadtbahn in Germany, premetros in Belgium, sneltram in the Netherlands, el√©trico in Portugal and fast trams in some other countries.  Overview  Radcliffe Viaduct, carrying the Manchester Metrolink, England. The introduction of trams in all the major cities of the late 19th century forced users and non-users alike to adjust to this intrusive, efficient form of transportation. The ridership was mostly middle-class white collar workers and shoppers, for the poor and working classes worked and shopped within their own neighborhoods and seldom went to the upscale venues serviced by the trams. City people were much less critical of electric tramways than of the horse-drawn versions. They helped eradicate stinking environmental hazards. By the mid-1910s, the urban population were fully accustomed to trams as a fashionable mode of transport for work and leisure, and as a very positive and visual sign of the prosperity and prestige of the city. Visitors from the farms, villages and small towns sometimes made a trip on the tram a high priority when they came to the big city.Barbara Schmucki, \\"The machine in the city: public appropriation of the tramway in Britain and Germany, 1870‚Äì1915.\\" Journal of Urban History 38.6 (2012): 1060-1093. Manchester Metrolink Trams in Frankfurt am Main, Germany Many tramways closed in the mid 20th century, as they were seen as less effective in terms of costs and use of the roadway than other forms of street transport. However in recent decades tram networks in many countries in Europe have grown considerably. The Netherlands, which already makes extensive use of trams, has plans to expand tram services to two additional cities. In Germany, many cities retain their original tram networks. In some places, tram networks have been added or expanded through the introduction of hybrid tram-train or stadtbahn systems which may combine standard railway, on-street and underground operations. Notable examples are the systems in Cologne and Karlsruhe. In Frankfurt-am-Main, many tram lines were transferred to U-Bahn operation. In the United Kingdom, investment in public transport in the late 1980s turned to light rail as an alternative to more costly underground railway solutions, with the opening of the Tyne & Wear Metro in Newcastle (1980) and the Docklands Light Railway in London (1987) systems. However, the first British city to reintroduce on-street trams was Manchester, with the opening of its Metrolink network in 1992. Several other UK cities followed with their own modern tram systems, including Sheffield (Supertram, opened 1994), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands Metro, opened 1999), London (Tramlink, opened 2000, albeit in a small part of Greater London), Nottingham (Nottingham Express Transit, opened 2004) and Edinburgh (Edinburgh Trams, opened 2014). Many of these cities are planning or building network extensions. Paris reintroduced trams with line T1 in 1992, and many French cities have seen a similar revival, for example the Tramway de Grenoble and the Montpellier trams. The Czech capital Prague had planned one new line and the extension of eight others between 2007 and 2016, with an official of the Prague Public Transport Company stating that \\"In Europe in the past 10 years, tram transportation is the preferred way of transit; we can say that tram transportation is going through its renaissance period\\". In Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, trams were reintroduced in December 2017, after being replaced by buses in 1964. All the former communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe, excluding Lithuania, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro, Moldova and Slovenia, have extensive tram infrastructure. Industrial freight use of city tram lines was a widespread practice until the 1960s but has since mostly disappeared. Another factor is an increasing replacement of trams with trolleybuses as cities face a rapid increase in traffic, and such replacement often allows more of the roadway to be used by cars. One of the exceptions is Warsaw, Poland, where the last trolleybus line was closed in the year 1995 due to high maintenance costs, and replaced with buses. Czech ƒåKD Tatra and the Hungarian Ganz factories were notable manufacturers of trams. = Austria = A tram in Innsbruck In Austria, Gmunden, Graz, Innsbruck, Linz and Vienna all have tramway systems. With 173.4 km of track, Vienna's network is one of the largest in the world. The cars have been constantly modernised over the years and many are now ultra low-floored. Many of the Austrian tramlines have been in constant operation since they were first opened. Vienna started with horse trams in 1865 and electrification followed in 1897. Graz had horse trams in 1878 and electric cars in 1898 while Linz goes back to 1880 with electrification in 1897.Wolfgang Kaiser: Stra√üenbahnen in √ñsterreich. GeraMond Verlag, 2004 The Gmunden Tramway, only 2.3 km long, is currently one of the shortest in the world, and with gradients of up to 9.6%,Taplin, Michael; and Russell, Michael (2002). Trams in Western Europe, p. 8. Harrow Weald, Middlesex (UK): Capital Transport Publishing. . it is also one of the steepest and has become a popular tourist attraction.Verein pro Gemundner Strassenbahn. Retrieved 2 March 2009. Innsbruck, which traditionally used second-hand trams from other cities, replaced its whole fleet with 32 Bombardier low-floor cars in Summer 2009. The P√∂stlingbergbahn, in Linz, an unusual \\"mountain tramway\\", has a gradient of 10.6%, which makes it one of the world's steepest gradients on a surviving adhesion-only railway.Buckley, Richard (2000). Tramways and Light Railways of Switzerland and Austria (2nd edition), p. 129/139. Gloucester, UK: Light Rail Transit Association. . The tramway now reaches the city centre via the tracks of the urban tram system. = Belarus = There are four tram systems in Belarus currently: Minsk, Mazyr, Novopolotsk and Vitebsk. = Belgium = The Belgian Coast Tram near Ostend. In Belgium an extensive prewar system of tram-like local railways called Vicinal or Buurtspoorweg lines used to exist, which had a greater total route kilometre length than the main-line railway system. The only survivors of the Vicinal system are the Kusttram, the longest tram line in the world, which almost reaches France at one end of the line and the Netherlands at the other, and two short lines that form part of the Charleroi Pre-metro. Urban tram networks exist in Antwerp, Ghent and Brussels, and are gradually being extended. = Bosnia and Herzegovina = A Sarajevo tram Sarajevo was not the first city in Europe to have a full-time (from dawn to dusk) operational electric tram line despite the claims on several websites. The electric tram started in Sarajevo only in 1895, which was much later than the first line in Austria-Hungary M√∂dling and Hinterbr√ºhl Tram that was opened in 1883 in Vienna. It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity served by an overhead line with pantograph current collectors. Sarajevo was among the pioneers but not the first. Several trams were badly damaged during the Bosnian war. Several European countries donated out of use trams to Sarajevo in the years after the war. Recently, more modern vehicles have arrived to upgrade and expand the fleet. = Bulgaria = A tram in Sofia Sofia had its first horse-drawn tram in operation in 1898. On 1 January 1901 the electric tram system was inaugurated and had 25 cars and 10 carriages and the total length of the lines was 25 km. Currently Sofia's extensive tram network consists of 16 routes, 3 of which are operated on standard gauge. Due to the construction of the Sofia Metro there were some closures and retracing, but the system continues to be one of the largest in Europe. According to the official website, as of 2006 there are 308 km of track, with 190 trams in service on any given weekday. = Croatia = Crotram low-floor trams in Zagreb, Croatia. Zagreb has had a tram service since 5 September 1891; it is now an extensive tram network with 15 day lines and 4 night lines covering over 116 km (72 mi) of tracks through 255 stations. ZET, the major transit authority in Zagreb, ordered 210 new, 100% low-floor trams from Croatian consortium Crotram. As of 2010, all of these locally produced, low-floor Crotram trams have been delivered, with a mixture of vehicle types in operation, including Czech Tatra Cars and various locally produced trams. Zagreb is one of the few tram networks in the world where most of the operations run at the kerb. The only other Croatian city with trams still in operation is Osijek. The first tram route commenced in 1884 (connecting the railway station and city square) and trams have been running since. Between 2006 and 2007, the trams were refurbished and modernised. Two lines presently exist, with another two extensions planned, doubling the network length. Dubrovnik, Opatija, Pula and Rijeka previously also operated trams. = Czech Republic = Ostrava tram VarioLF3 in its traditional blue-and-white colour combination. The Czech Republic is well known for its extensive tram infrastructure, with trams often being present even in small cities. The largest network is in Prague, with 141 kilometres of track and 35 lines, including 9 night lines. Other cities with tram systems are Brno, Ostrava, Plze≈à, Olomouc, Most and Litv√≠nov (common network), Liberec (including intercity line to Jablonec). Tram networks in nine other cities were closed down mainly during the 1960s and replaced with trolleybuses or buses. Before changes in 1989, ƒåKD Tatra in Prague was the largest tram producer in the world, mainly exporting its trams to Soviet Bloc countries. Production was definitely stopped in 2001, after ƒåKD was sold to Siemens AG. The tradition of tram production is continuing with ≈†koda Transportation, Inekon and PRAGOIMEX. = Denmark = A system is in operation in Aarhus, the Aarhus Letbane where a new town tramway is combined with converted local railways, starting operation in 2017 As of March 2018, only a part of the new line had been opened. The rest of the new line together with the converted lines is still waiting for opening. Construction has also already begun of the tramway system in Odense with expected completion in 2021. = Estonia = Tatra KT4 tram in Tallinn. In Estonia, trams are used only in the capital, Tallinn. There has been a growing tram network in Tallinn since 1888, when traffic was started by horse- powered trams. The first line was electrified on 28 October 1925. Estonian- built electric trams were also used, with some gas-powered trams having been used in the 1920s and 1930s. The last part of the system to be electrified was the spur to Kopli in 1951, which was also converted to double track at the time, and was connected to the rest of the network in 1953. From 1955 to 1988, German-built trams were used. The first Czechoslovakian-built tram arrived in 1973. In 2007, 56 Tatra KT4SUs, 12 KTNF6s (rebuilt KT4SUs) and 23 second-hand KT4Ds trams were in use. There are four lines, with total length of tramlines 39 km. Plans have been in the works since the late 1970s to open a light rail line from one of the suburbs, Lasnam√§e, to the city centre. In 2017, an extension was opened to Tallinn Airport. This is the first extension to the network since 1955, when the stretch to √úlemiste district was lengthened. The track and electrical systems have also undergone major work to enable the system to accommodate 20 new vehicles delivered by CAF in 2016. = Finland = Old style Valmet trams in Helsinki In Finland, there have been three cities with trams: Helsinki, Turku and Viipuri. Only Helsinki has retained its tram network. The system has operated continuously since 1891 and it was fully electrified by 1901. Currently there are 12 tram lines on 89.5 kilometres of track. Around 200,000 passengers use the tram network each weekday and within the inner city of Helsinki trams have established a position as the main form of public transport. The network is being actively developed, with a new line opened in 2008 and more lines planned to connect new residential areas to be built in 2009‚Äì2015. In 2009, the city invited bids for manufacturers to produce 40 new low-floor trams, with an option for further 50 available. The City of Tampere begun construction of a tram network in late 2016, with phase 1 from the city centre to Hervanta, and the University hospital. The first phase of the tram system is scheduled for completion in 2021, with services expected to begin in the same year. Construction of phase 2, from the city centre to Lent√§v√§nniemi is expected to begin in 2020. The cities of Oulu and Turku have started the planning of tram networks. Turku has accepted The Light Rail Network of Turku's principal plan as obeyed normatively. Even though Oulu's vice mayor rejected the idea, the city included it in The Zoning Scheme of New Oulu as \\"normative\\" and \\"necessary\\". = France = Trams in Besan√ßon, France. Despite the closure of most of France's tram systems in previous decades, a rapidly growing number of France's major cities boast new tram networks, including Paris (the largest French network), Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Strasbourg, Grenoble, Montpellier, Saint-√âtienne and Besan√ßon. Since the 1990s, tram systems have been introduced, or expanded, in twenty-seven towns and cities. Many experiments, such as ground level power supply in Bordeaux, avoiding the need for overhead line equipment, or trolleybus-tram- BRT hybrids in Nancy and Caen with Bombardier Guided Light Transit. Smaller cities like Avignon are now planning tram lines. = Germany = Five generations of trams in Berlin, Germany. Tramways in Germany served as the primary means of urban transport until the early 1960s when they were systematically replaced by buses. Tramways begun to reappear in the 1980s, before once again becoming a modern means of public transport in the 1990s. Popular notions of fashion have been used by scholars to explain this cycle of acceptance rejection and restoration. Germany (where tramways are referred to as Stra√üenbahn, meaning street railway) is notable for its large numbers of extensive tram systems, although even in this country many systems were closed after the Second World War, such as the tramway in Hamburg which last ran in 1978. Following the renaissance of trams in France and positive experience with tram-train and similar concepts (e.g. the Karlsruhe model), most German tramways are expanding, including new systems in cities that had previously abandoned them or entirely new systems in cities without any tram history.  Light rail in Germany  Stadtbahn, literally city railway in the German language, is the term for light rail in Germany and is the predecessor of the North American light rail. Most German light rail systems were started in the 1960s and 1970s with the intention of establishing full-scale underground, or U-Bahn (short for Untergrundbahn) systems. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned these plans due to the high costs of converting tramways, and the most common systems are a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban areas, with U-Bahn style operation, featuring underground stations, in the city centre areas.. = Greece = Tram in Athens, Greece. Trams were the main mode of mass transportation in Athens and Thessaloniki before World War II. The first trams in Athens begun operating in 1882. They were light vehicles drawn by three horses running on an extensive network throughout the city centre and a line reaching the suburb of Faliro. After the German occupation the tramways begun to decline, with lines gradually abandoned and replaced by trolleybuses, considered more appropriate and agile for the urban environment at that time. It is frequently mentioned somehow poetically that \\"The last bell of the Athens Tram rang on the midnight of October 16, 1960\\". The tram had been a trademark of Athens until that date, and it is still viewed nostalgically. One tram line was left in Perama, which remained in operation until April 1977. A modern tram line was installed for the 2004 Summer Olympics, with vehicles designed by the famous Ferrari designer Sergio Pininfarina. There are three routes and 24 km of tramlines, running from Syntagma Square to Eden Station, and from Peace & Friendship Stadium in Piraeus to Glyfada along the coast. Routes were extended by 0.7 km from Glyfada to Voula in 2007, and will expand 2.5 km further from Peace & Friendship Stadium to Piraeus centre by 2017. = Hungary = The Hungarian cities of Budapest, Miskolc, Debrecen and Szeged currently have tramways. The Budapest network, at 156 km, is the backbone of the capital's transit system and is by far the most extensive in the country. Historically, Hungary has had tramways in Sopron until 1923, P√©cs until 1960, Ny√≠regyh√°za until 1969 and Szombathely until 1974. = Ireland = The Luas in Dublin, Ireland. Replacing a once-extensive network of Dublin tramways which closed in 1949, in 2004 the Irish capital Dublin opened the first two lines of a new light-rail system known as Luas, Irish for \\"speed\\". It features on-street running in the city centre, but is considered a light-rail system as it runs along a dedicated right-of-way for much of its suburban route. Two light-metro lines fully segregated from traffic were planned to be built by 2014, but were cancelled due to the economic downturn. Plans also exist for light-rail systems in the cities of Cork, which had a modest system until the early 20th century, and Galway. In January 2007, the Green Party promised that, if it formed part of the next government in 2007, it would have light rail systems built in those two cities. A smaller campaign was also ongoing for the construction of a light rail system in Limerick. = Italy = #8 Tram in Rome, Italy. Trams in Italy have been in constant operation since the mid-19th century. The first horse-drawn line opened in Turin in 1871, whilst the first electric line was opened in 1893 in Milan. Current tramways in Italy are: * Bergamo ‚Äì since 2009 with 1 suburban light rail line running over 12.5 km of track, operated by TEB Bergamo. * Cagliari ‚Äì since 2008 with 2 suburban light rail lines running over 12 km of track, operated by ARST. * Florence ‚Äì since 2010 with 2 urban lines running over16.8 km of track, operated by a joint venture GEST between municipal transport company ATAF Firenze and RATP Paris. * Messina ‚Äì since 2003 with 1 urban line running over 7.7 km of track, operated by ATM Messina. * Mestre/Venice ‚Äì since 2010 with 1 urban line running over 7.7 km of track, operated by ACTV. * Milan ‚Äì since 1881 with 17 urban lines and 1 interurban line, running over 181 km of track, operated by ATM. * Naples ‚Äì since 1875 with 3 urban lines running over 11.8 km of track, operated by ANM Napoli. * Padua ‚Äì since 2007 with 1 Translohr urban line running over 10.3 km of track, operated by APS Padova. * Palermo ‚Äì since 2015 with 4 urban lines. * Rome ‚Äì since 1877 with 6 urban lines running over 40 km of track, operated by ATAC Roma. * Sassari ‚Äì since 2006 with 1 tram-train line running over 4.3 km of track, operated by ARST. * Trieste ‚Äì since 1902 with 1 hybrid tramway- funicular railway line running over 5.2 km of track, operated by Trieste Trasporti. * Turin ‚Äì since 1871 with 9 urban lines running over 84 km of track, operated by GTT Torino. = Latvia = ≈†koda 15 T in Riga, Latvia There are currently three tram systems in Latvia, in Riga, Daugavpils and LiepƒÅja. = Luxembourg = Trams began serving Luxembourg City in 1875, and in Esch- sur-Alzette in 1927. First generation trams in the country ended with the closure of the Esch-sur-Alzette network in 1956, and the Luxembourg City network in 1964. A second generation of trams began service in December 2017, along a new route that will, by 2021, run from Luxembourg Airport to the Cloche d'Or business district. = Malta = Trams in Floriana in the early 20th century A tram service was inaugurated in Malta on 23 February 1905, linking the capital Valletta with Floriana, ƒ¶amrun, Birkirkara, the Three Cities, Qormi and ≈ªebbuƒ°. The service competed with the Malta Railway and later the Malta buses. Service eventually ceased on 15 December 1929. The Ministry of Transport has considered the reintroduction of trams in Malta. = Netherlands = In the Netherlands many local light railways were referred to as trams, even where the steam locomotives did not have enclosed motion. Today, extensive tram networks exist in: * Amsterdam (GVB) * Rotterdam (RET) * The Hague (HTM) * Utrecht (Qbuzz) thumb Trikk 17 Rikshospitalet ved Oslo City = Norway = There are three tramways () in Norway; the Oslo Tramway that operates as a hybrid between a light rail and a street tram with six lines, and the suburban line of Trondheim Tramway, the Gr√•kall Line. The Bergen Tramway was closed in 1965, but the new Bergen Light Rail opened in 2010. = Poland = Pesa 120Na in Warsaw Trams currently operate in 15 Polish cities: Bydgoszcz, Czƒôstochowa, ElblƒÖg, Gda≈Ñsk, Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, Upper Silesian Industrial Region, GrudziƒÖdz, Krak√≥w, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Olsztyn , Pozna≈Ñ, Szczecin, Toru≈Ñ, Warsaw and Wroc≈Çaw. The largest system is in Upper Silesia with 317 km of track and 35 lines, followed by Warsaw with 280 km of track and 34 lines and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ with 217 km of track and 28 lines. A system in P≈Çock was planned but the construction was postponed indefinitely in 2011. = Portugal = Authentic vintage (ITB1616) tram in Lisbon The Lisbon tramway network has been managed by the Companhia Carris de Ferro de Lisboa, or Carris for short, for over a century. Since 1995, the fleet includes authentic vintage cars, units made from vintage bodies powered by modern engines, and fully modern articulated trams. In Porto, a tram network has been in operation since 12 September 1895, making it the first electric tramway in the Iberian Peninsula.King, B. R.; and Price, J. H. (1995). The Tramways of Portugal (4th edition), p. 41. London: Light Rail Transit Association. . Many routes closed in the 1970s and 1980s, but one survived and some closed sections have reopened in the 2000s, and four routes are currently in operation. A heritage tram line operates seasonally in Sintra. Reductions in the network's original service started in 1954, until closure in 1975. It was re-opened in 1980 using a section of the former line and surviving trams.Lennox Docherty, Bob (September 2008). \\"Iron whispers in the Pinewoods of Sintra\\". Tramways & Urban Transit, pp. 364‚Äì365. LRTA Publishing. Almada has a light rail network, the Metro Sul do Tejo, which opened in 2007, following two decades of planning. Extensions to Seixal and Barreiro are currently planned. = Romania = V3A-CH-PPC low-floor tram in Bucharest, Romania There are currently 11 tram systems in Romania, in Arad, Boto≈üani, BrƒÉila, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Craiova, Gala≈£i, Ia≈üi, Oradea, Ploie≈üti, Timi»ôoara. = Serbia = CAF Urbos 3 tram in Belgrade, Serbia Belgrade has a large tram network with 12 lines on 127.3 km of track. The system is operated with around 250 units and with ƒåKD Tatra KT4 and Duewag Be 4/6 trams. The first horse-drawn tram line was introduced in October 1892 and the first electric one in 1894. There are long-term plans to build a new track to the Mirijevo neighbourhood, in the east of the city. Previously the cities of Ni≈°, Novi Sad, and Subotica also had tram networks, but these closed in Novi Sad and Ni≈° in the 1950s, and in Subotica in 1974. = Slovakia = There are tram networks in both Bratislava and Ko≈°ice. The first trams in Bratislava started operation in 1895, and there are currently 8 lines in service with a track length of 39.5 km. A new tram line is being built across the river Danube to the Petrzalka suburb on the right bank. There are multiple plans for expanding the network, but funding is currently unclear. Ko≈°ice started operating trams in 1914, after wagons pulled by horses and a steam tramway. Trams currently run over 34 km of tracks and run on 7 lines within the city and 8 fast tram lines. = Spain = A tram running on a section of grassed track in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain. In Spain, modern tram networks have been opened in Alicante, Barcelona (Trambaix and Trambes√≤s), Bilbao, Madrid, Murcia, Parla, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Seville, Valencia, V√©lez-M√°laga, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza. Ja√©n had built a tram network in 2011, but it only operated for a short period. = Sweden = M31 tram running in central Gothenburg. The most extensive network in Sweden is in Gothenburg with a total track length of 80 km. Stockholm had horse-drawn trams from 1877; however, the large tram system began to be abandoned and removed in 1957, with the last tram running in September 1967. Presently Stockholm has four lines on three non-connected systems owned by Storstockholms Lokaltrafik: Sp√•rv√§g City; Liding√∂banan; Nockebybanan and Tv√§rbanan. There are plans for future extensions and two projects are in active development. Norrk√∂ping has an 18.7 km tram network consisting of two radial lines, which was extended by 5 kilometres in 2006‚Äì2011. In the southern university town of Lund a tramway line is under construction. It will open in August 2020. A single-track heritage line has operated in Malm√∂ since 1987, after the last \\"real\\" tram line closed in 1973. City officials decided in October 2008 that the city should have at least one light rail line operating before 2020, and up to six lines after that. A combined tramway museum and heritage tramway is located at Malmk√∂ping, S√∂dermanland County, maintained by Svenska Sp√•rv√§gss√§llskapet, the Swedish Tramway Society. = Switzerland = A tram in Bel-Air stop, Geneva The first tram in Switzerland began operations in 1862 in Geneva. The tram, which was initially horse-drawn, got converted to steam in 1877. In 1888 the second electric tram system in the world was inaugurated in Vevey, linking the city to Montreux and Ch√¢teau de Chillon. By 1923, a total of 29 towns and cities in the country operated tram networks, and at 170km's in extension and operating beyond the country's borders into France, Geneva's tram network became Europe's largest system After WW2 and the introduction of buses and trolleybuses, many of the networks shrunk. Geneva lost all but one of its lines, and some cities closed their trams, including Fribourg, Lausanne, Lugano, Biel/Bienne, Luzern, Vevey, Montreux, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, or Zug. However, Switzerland is remarkable in that a few major cities kept their networks mostly intact until today. For example, although some of the tram lines extending beyond the city of Zurich closed down, the vast majority of lines within the city did not suffer any closures. Similarly, Bern and Basel kept most if their tram lines intact. Because, with the exception of Geneva and Lausanne, the country's major cities have not lost their tram systems, Switzerland has not witnessed a major re-construction of trams as happened in the rest of Europe in the decades following the 1990s. The major exception is Geneva, where the system has been growing back again from the one line and 8km's that was left out of its original network, to 5 lines and 36km's. By the end of 2019, with the opening of line 17, the network had once again extended over the border to the French city of Annemasse, with planned future extensions to over 50km's by 2026 . = Turkey = Recently revived historic tram line in Kadik√∂y, Istanbul The first tram line in Istanbul was constructed by Konstantin Karapano Efendi, and started operating on 31 July 1871 between the districts of Azapkapi and Ortak√∂y. In 1869, the tram company \\"Dersaated Tramvay ≈ûirketi\\" was established. 430 horses were used to draw the 45 carriages, including 15 summer-type and some double-deckers, on meter gauge track. In 1912, the horse-drawn tram had to cease to operate for one year because the Ministry of Defence sent all the horses to the front during the Balkan War. The tram network was electrified by overhead contact wire on 2 February 1914. The tram began to run on the Anatolian part of Istanbul on 8 June 1928 between √úsk√ºdar and Kisikli. By the 1950s, the length of the tram lines reached 130 km. Trams were in service on the European part until 12 August 1961 and on the Anatolian part until 14 November 1966. Heritage trams returned to Istiklal Caddesi in 1990 and in Moda in 2003. Modern trams began service on the European side in 1992 and have since been expanded. Istanbul is the only city in European Turkey with operating trams. In Anatolia, there are operating trams in Adana, Antalya, Bursa, Eski≈üehir, Gaziantep, and Kayseri. Izmir formerly had trams and new lines are currently being planned. = United Kingdom and Crown dependencies= An old Double decker tram preserved at the National Tramway Museum (from the former Leeds Tramway) Until 1935 there was a large and comprehensive network of tram systems. For example, one could travel by tram across northwest England, from Liverpool to Ashton-under-Lyne (approx. 43 miles) using connecting systems. Most UK systems were municipally owned. These had often been inherited from private sector operators, who had been granted limited-term leases and did not maintain their networks beyond bare necessities as the time for a forced handover approached. When councils acquired these dilapidated systems, it was almost always cheaper to replace them with buses. The 1931 Royal Commission on traffic argued that trams held up cars.London Trams and Trolleybuses . Retrieved 13 February 2009. There was some public reaction against tramway abandonment, but seemingly less than the similarly unsuccessful reaction against Beeching cuts in the 1960s. Some people, particularly motorists, welcomed the removal of trams, which were perceived as obstructing the highway.The Campaign To Save the London Trams 1946‚Äì1952 from the Collected Papers of Alan John Watkins. Retrieved 13 February 2009. Not all passengers transferred to replacement buses, and car ownership continued to increase. Britain's tram systems were mainly dismantled between 1920 and 1960, and after the closure of Glasgow's once extensive GCT network in 1962, only Blackpool's trams survived, although the Great Orme Tramway funicular line continued to operate up the Great Orme in Llandudno. Since the 1990s, a second generation of tram networks have been built and have started operating in Manchester in 1992, Sheffield in 1994, the West Midlands in 1999, South London in 2000, Nottingham in 2004 and Edinburgh in 2014, whilst the original trams in Blackpool were upgraded to second generation vehicles in 2012. There have been numerous other proposals for tramways in other cities and extensions to existing systems the UK, whilst the systems in Manchester and the West Midlands are currently having extensions built. On the Isle of Man, electric tram cars have run almost continuously since the late 19th century (albeit mainly as summer tourist attractions) on the Manx Electric Railway (Douglas to Ramsey) and the Snaefell Mountain Railway (Laxey to Snaefell summit), as well as horse trams along Douglas Promenade. = Former USSR/Russia and CIS = Trams in Kiev's Kontraktova Square. The St. Andrew Church is visible in the right background. In many cities of Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan tramways have been facing difficulties since the disintegration of the USSR. Tramways of Shakhty, Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan, Grozny, Tbilisi, Baku, Yerevan, Almaty, Sumqayit, Gandja and Tashkent have been abandoned. Some tramway systems have suffered extensive closures of vital parts of network (including Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev) and some are facing threats of closures (Nizhniy Novgorod) or even total abandonment (Voronezh). The tramway network in Saint Petersburg is the largest in Europe, and was once the second-largest in the world, surpassed only by Pacific Electric's 1600 km network in Los Angeles. The network in Melbourne, Australia, is now larger. Tram on Moscow Gate Square in Saint Petersburg.

It is on the South Western Main Line, down the line from . History When the Southampton and Dorchester Railway (S&DR;) was opened on 1 June 1847, Wool was one of the original stations on the line. The line was originally built with a single track but no telegraph, with the result that there was a head-on collision between Wool and on 27 September 1847; casualties were light. The S&DR; was amalgamated into the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) on 11 October 1848, and that company doubled the line in stages: the section from to Wool was doubled on 1 June 1863, and the double track was extended from Wool to Dorchester on 1 August 1863. The station was host to a Southern Railway camping coach from 1936 to 1939. Two camping coaches were positioned here by the Southern Region from 1954 to 1960, the coaches were replaced in 1961 by two Pullman camping coaches until 1967. The coaches were fitted with a full kitchen, two sleeping compartments and a room with two single beds. Services Until 1967, trains through the station were normally steam hauled. Between 1967 and 1988, passenger services were normally provided by Class 33/1 diesel locomotives with Class 438 coaching stock (also known as 4-TC units). The line was electrified in 1988, using the standard British Rail Southern Region direct current third rail at 750 volts. Class 442 electric multiple units were initially used following electrification, until being displaced by new Class 444 electric multiple units in 2007.

Geographic range In Mexico it is found from central Sinaloa to southern Chiapas. It has also been introduced to the United States in the very southern tip of the state of Texas and in the state of Florida. Taxonomy The Mexican Spinytail Iguana was first described by German zoologist Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann in 1834. The generic name, Ctenosaura, is derived from two Greek words: ctenos (ŒöœÑŒµŒΩœåœÇ), meaning \\"comb\\" (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (œÉŒ±œçœÅŒ±), meaning \\"lizard\\". Its specific name is the Latin word pectinata meaning \\"combed\\", also referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back. The genus it belongs to represents the most diverse group of iguanas with 15 currently recognized species. These species inhabit lowland (below 1200m elevation) dry forests on both coasts of Mexico and Central America. All species of Ctenosaura fall within one of seven clades. Distributions of these clades fall geographically within well established areas. Closely related species show allopatry whereas species from divergent clades show sympatry. Phylogenic study shows this species to be most closely related to C. acanthura, the Northeastern spinytail iguana.De Queiroz, Kevin. (1987): Phylogenetic systematics of iguanine lizards: a comparative osteological study. University of California Publishing, 118:1-203. Additional mitochondrial DNA research is being performed to determine whether additional subspecies may exist. Because of the different human cultures throughout this species distribution, the clades are being evaluated for their impact from humans. For example, these iguanas are not eaten in their northern ranges by humans as they are in the southern ranges, but the hatchlings in the southern ranges have a better survival rate due to better environmental conditions. Description Mexican Spinytail Iguanas have distinctive keeled scales on their long tails, which gives them their common name. They are one of the larger members of the genus Ctenosaura, capable of growing to 1.3m (4.3 feet) in length, with females being slightly smaller than males at , and are typically brown or grey-brown in coloration with a yellowish ventral surface. They have a crest of long spines which extend down the center of their back. Hatchlings are often a bright green color with no pattern and darken as they age. Distribution The Mexican Spinytail Iguana is native to Western Mexico from Sinaloa to Oaxaca. This iguana has been introduced to Brownsville, Texas and South Florida and reproduces in the wild in several feral populations. On the south-eastern Florida coast, these iguanas have been found on Key Biscayne, Hialeah, and in Broward County. On the south-western Florida coast, it has been reported on Gasparilla Island. It is currently estimated as of December 2007 that there are 12,000 iguanas on this island, descended from a trio of pet lizards released by a resident in the 1970s. They are regarded as a \\"nuisance animal\\" on Gasparilla island because the iguanas eat ornamental flowers and shrubs and prey on nesting birds and sea turtle eggs. They have been known to chew through electrical and telephone cables. They may also carry salmonella and their appearance has been known to scare timid residents. As the iguanas like to burrow in the sand it is feared that their tunnels could cause dunes and even seawalls to collapse and deprive the island of crucial protection from landfalling hurricanes. Behavior Ctenosaura similis climbing a tree The Mexican Spiny-tailed iguana is a social lizard, which has adapted to living in groups as opposed to other species of Ctenosaura which tend to be solitary animals. These iguanas are excellent climbers, and prefer a rocky habitat with plenty of crevices to hide in, rocks to bask on, and nearby trees to climb. They are diurnal and fast moving, employing their speed to escape predators but will lash with their tails and bite if cornered. They are often found dwelling near or in towns in their native Mexico and where they have been introduced elsewhere. Juveniles consume a diet consting mostly of insects. However, adults are primarily herbivorous, eating a variety of flowers, leaves, stems, and fruit, but they will opportunistically eat small animals, eggs, and arthropods. Reproduction Mating occurs in the spring. Males show dominance and interest by head bobbing, eventually chasing the female until he can catch her and subdue her. Within eight to ten weeks, the female will dig a nest and lay clutches of up to 50 eggs in a burrow of loose soil. These eggs hatch in 90 days with the bright green babies digging their way out of the sand. Threatened status Ctenosaura pectinata is used as a traditional food source in its native Mexico. Although not listed on the IUCN Redlist, the species is listed on the Mexican Red List NOM-059-2001 as threatened and it is currently illegal to hunt them in Mexico. This protection does not apply to areas in North America where they have been introduced, however. Although hunting, trapping, and killing of these iguanas is illegal throughout Mexico; the Balsas depression along the borders of the states Michoac√°n and Guerrero is one of the largest illegal hunting and trading areas. The remoteness of the areas and lack of enforcement of the laws is seen as the main reason. A study is being conducted by the Instituto de Biologia, UNAM, to solve the over- exploitation problem and to determine if the iguanas can be successfully farmed as a food source similar to the Green Iguana and the closely related Ctenosaura similis.

History  A Swanage branch train in 1966 The current station opened in 1887, replacing the original station which opened in 1847 and was sited east of what is now only a pedestrian crossing. This station had two bay platforms which served the branch line to Swanage from 1885 until 1972, when the branch closed. The branch line to Swanage is now the preserved Swanage Railway, a steam locomotive operated heritage railway that currently operates between Swanage and a Park and Ride site at Norden just north of Corfe Castle. The rail connection between the Swanage Railway and the Network Rail tracks at Worgret Junction has been restored,\\"Project Wareham / The Purbeck Line\\"Swanage Railway website restoring a connection with the National Rail network. On Summer Saturdays trains run through from a number of South Western Railway stations, including Waterloo and Salisbury through Wareham to Corfe Castle to link with Swanage Railway services.  Services  A going to London Wareham station is served by two South Western Railway services an hour from London Waterloo to Weymouth, usually a Class 444 express Desiro unit or Class 450 outer suburban Desiro unit. Prior to 9 December 2007 it was the terminus for an hourly local service from Brockenhurst, but this has now been partially replaced by the additional Weymouth service. Until 1967, trains through the station were normally steam hauled. Class 205 (2H) diesel electric multiple units were used during the final years of British Rail operation on the Swanage branch. Between 1967 and 1988, passenger services on the London- Weymouth line were normally provided by Class 33/1 diesel locomotives with Class 438 coaching stock (also known as 4-TC units). The line was electrified in 1988, using the standard British Rail Southern Region direct current third rail at 750 volts. After electrification, Class 442 electric multiple units were initially used, but these were replaced by new Class 444 electric multiple units in 2007. = Heritage = Track is operationally through from Worgret Junction to the Swanage Railway, although the normal steam service on the line still runs from Swanage and terminates at Norden station near Corfe Castle. The line's regular service has now been extended to terminate at Wareham, allowing interchange with the main line. This was achieved on 13 June 2017 when a four-coach diesel-hauled trial service began running to Wareham.

Gaither received significant playing time later in the 2006 season due to the struggles and injury of starter Matt McCoy. Gaither got his first NFL start at weakside linebacker on December 4, 2006 on a Monday Night Football win against the Carolina Panthers. He became the starter at weakside linebacker for the final 7 games (post and regular season) and finished with 58 tackles, 1 sack, and 1 interception.

Military career A lieutenant general of cavalry, Portocarrero y Lasso de la Vega distinguished himself on campaign with John of Austria the Younger in Sicily, Flanders, Catalonia and Portugal. He was in the Battle of Arras, Cond√© and Saint Guillaume. He lost his right arm in the Battle of the Dunes at Dunkirk in June 1658. He had a prosthesis made of silver, and his soldiers nicknamed him Brazo de Plata (Arm of Silver). He was minister of the Council of the Indies and of the Real Junta de Guerra de las Indias (Royal War Council of the Indies). He also served as captain general of New Spain during his term as viceroy. As viceroy of New Spain He was named viceroy of New Spain on April 17, 1686 under the authority of King Charles II of Spain. Upon arriving in Veracruz, he stayed there a few days in order to gather intelligence on whether the French had established a base on the Gulf coast. (France and Spain were then at war.) He ordered two well-armed brigantines to sail the coast to a point now on the east coast of the United States to look for a French colony. (They didn't actually sail that far.) He arrived in Chapultepec November 5, 1686 and took the oath of office on November 16. His formal entry into Mexico City took place on November 30, 1686 and his term of office is dated from that day. The following month three English pirates arrived in the city under heavy guard. They had been taken prisoner at the Laguna de T√©rminos, stating that they had been among a group of 100 English who had arrived seven months earlier to cut precious woods to be sent to Jamaica. The viceroy took steps to expel them. The two brigantines returned, bringing news that they had found a few small ships and a half-built fort at San Bernardo Bay, Texas, but that the builders of the fort had been killed by Indians. He ordered the construction of another aqueduct for Mexico City. This aqueduct ran from Alberca Chica of Chapultepec, at the foot of the hill, along the boulevards of Tacubaya and Arcos de Bel√©n to a point in the city given the name El Salto del Agua (The Waterfall, literally Water Jump). This work, 3,908 meters long with 904 masonry arches was finally finished in 1779, during the term of Viceroy Antonio Mar√≠a Bucareli y Urs√∫a. Portocarrero bore the cost from his own pocket. Fearing the presence of the French in San Bernardo and Esp√≠ritu Santo, Portocarrero accelerated the pacification of the province of Nueva Extremadura de Coahuila and named Captain Alonso de Le√≥n governor. On August 12, 1689, de Le√≥n founded the city of Santiago de la Monclova, named for the viceroy. One hundred fifty families were established there, including 270 well-armed men to repulse any incursions of the French. The viceroy also ordered the repair or construction of other forts farther north, all in communication with each other. The viceroy ordered increased vigilance along the Gulf coast beyond Tampico, to guard against the forces of Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, marauding from Fort St. Louis in Matagorda (Texas). He expelled all foreign priests without licenses to preach in the colony. As viceroy of Peru Portocarrero was named viceroy of Peru on May 3, 1688, the last viceroy of New Spain to be transferred there. He turned over the government to his successor, Gaspar de la Cerda, 8th Count of Galve on November 19, 1688, but did not depart until the following year, for lack of transport. On May 11, 1689 he sailed from the port of Acapulco. He died in Lima in 1705. His daughter, Do√±a Mar√≠a Mercedes Portocarrero y Zamudio married Don Jos√© Manuel Tagle y Isasaga, 3rd Marquess of Torre Tagle. He is also the maternal grandfather of Don Jos√© Bernardo de Tagle y Portocarrero, 4th Marquess of Torre Tagle, one of the most powerful man in Peru during the 17th century and also became the country's president two times.

Brown (born October 9, 1956) is an American politician and educator from Washington. A member of the Democratic Party, Brown has served in both houses of the Washington State Legislature, including eight years as the first Democratic female Majority Leader of the Washington State Senate. She has also served as the Chancellor of Washington State University Spokane, a position she stepped down from in order to mount an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House. She currently serves as the Director of the Washington State Department of Commerce. Born and raised in Illinois, she received her undergraduate education from the University of Illinois and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Brown spent over three decades in higher education teaching economics at Eastern Washington University and in the organizational leadership program at Gonzaga University. She was appointed the first female Chancellor of Washington State University, Spokane in 2013 and served in that role until 2017. Brown first entered politics in 1992 when she was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives. She was elected to the State Senate in 1996 and elected as the first female Democratic Majority Leader of that body in 2005. She returned to politics in 2018, running to represent against Republican incumbent Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Brown was considered a dark horse candidate and the race received national attention, though Brown lost. In 2019, Governor Jay Inslee appointed her director of the Washington State Department of Commerce. She declined a run for Mayor of Spokane in 2019. Early life and education Lisa J. Brown was born October 9, 1956, in Robinson, Illinois. She graduated from the University of Illinois with a bachelor's degree in economics. She earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Career Outside of politics, Brown worked in higher education and public leadership positions as a professor, a university administrator and she is currently the director of the Washington State Department of Commerce. Brown began working as an associate professor of economics at Eastern Washington University in 1981, a position she would hold until 2001. She served briefly as the interim director of the university's Women's Center in 1983.Memorandum to the Friends of the Women's Center from Lee Swedberg, September 15, 1983, Women's Center Publications, EWU University Archives and Special Collections While on sabbatical from Eastern Washington University in 1990, Lisa traveled to Nicaragua where she participated as an election observer at a Nicaraguan election and studied and taught an economics class at Central American University in Managua. When the conservative National Opposition Union won power in 1990, Brown expressed worry that the new leaders would walk back the partially state-run command economy, replacing it with a more conservative, market-based economy. Brown also worked as a professor in organizational leadership at Gonzaga University from 2001 until 2012. She became the Chancellor of Washington State University Spokane in 2013 after leaving the state senate. As chancellor, Brown oversaw the creation of the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, the first medical school in the Washington State University system and the second public medical school in the state. The school opened in 2015 and its inaugural class was seated in the fall of 2017.. In 2016, Brown accompanied former Lieutenant Governor of Washington Brad Owen to Cuba on a fact-finding trip concerning healthcare. Upon return, Brown praised aspects of the community-based Cuban healthcare system in an interview. In the same interview, Brown stated that aspects of the Cuban model should be used in the United States. Washington Governor Jay inslee appointed Brown as director of the Department of Commerce on January 29, 2019. Her term began on February 11. Washington State Legislature =House of Representatives= Brown was first elected to the state legislature in 1992. She received 46.51% of the vote out in a field of five candidates (which included four fellow Democrats) during the September primary election. In the November general election, she defeated Republican Chuck Potter by receiving 64.48% of the vote to Potter's 35.52%. She was reelected in 1994, receiving 64.55% to Republican John G. Titchenal's 35.45%. Brown was named minority floor leader at the start of her second term. Committee assignments First term: *Committee on Transportation, Vice-Chair *Committee on Revenue *Committee on Human Services Second term: *Committee on Transportation *Committee on Children and Family Services *Rules Committee =State senate= Brown announced she would challenge one-term incumbent John A. Moyer in the 1996 election on April 22, 1996. In her announcement, she named education and welfare as her two major priorities for the campaign and her tenure. Due to Moyer's perceived vulnerability and the potential for the seat to swing the balance of power in the state senate, the race was expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive in the state. Brown went on to win the election, receiving 57.65% of the vote in the September primary and 55.3% of the vote in the general election. Brown was unopposed in 2000. She won over 60% of the vote in 2004 and almost 75% of the vote in 2008. Political positions =Tax policy= At a candidates' debate in Spokane in 1996, State Senator John A. Moyer, whom Brown was challenging, questioned why Brown voted in 1993 for what he called the biggest tax increase in state history. Brown replied that Moyer mischaracterized the vote, and said she supported the tax increase to balance the budget. In 1995, when the state had a budget surplus, Brown criticized Republicans for not offering tax breaks to middle class families. Brown supported using the surplus to lower the state sales tax and property taxes for low- and middle-income families. She opposed a Republican- supported measure to raise the gas tax. In 2005, Brown voted against a $258 million property tax cut. Washington law, passed by voter initiative I-960, requires that a two-thirds majority be reached in the legislature on bills which raise taxes. As State Senate Majority Leader, Brown initiated a lawsuit in 2009 challenging the measure, which the state supreme court rejected unanimously. Later, in 2010, Brown voted yes on S.B. 6843 and S.B. 6130 to suspend the two-thirds threshold required by state law to raise taxes. In 2005, Brown had advocated for the legislature to be given the authority to raise taxes without having to meet the two-thirds threshold. =Welfare policy= Brown's time in the House coincided with a national movement for welfare reform, a large part of President Bill Clinton's agenda. Brown was opposed to welfare reform that involved making any cuts to the program, specifically those which cut programs for parents and children. She opposed a welfare bill that would end benefits for teenage parents and put a two-year cap on benefits for everyone. Approximately 40% of the citizens in Spokane relied on public assistance programs during Brown's tenure. =Health care policy= Brown, during her 2018 campaign for the House of Representatives, proposed the U.S. federal government provide a public option for health insurance, the lowering of the age of eligibility for Medicare, and the expansion of Medicaid. She has explicitly declined to endorse a full overhaul of the U.S. health care system stating \\"I don't think it‚Äôs realistic to expect that we‚Äôre going to create an entire public system, and then tell everyone they have to give up their current system to go into it.\\" 2018 U.S. House candidacy After months of speculation, Brown announced her candidacy for United States House of Representatives on August 31, 2017. She challenged Republican incumbent Cathy McMorris Rodgers in Washington's 5th congressional district, which has not had a Democratic representative since former House Speaker Tom Foley lost reelection to George Nethercutt in 1994 during the Republican Revolution. During a December 20, 2017, town hall, Brown opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Republican-supported legislation which had been passed earlier that month, which lowered personal and corporate tax rates, and repealed the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act. McMorris Rodgers, as the Chair of the Republican House Caucus, was one of the major proponents of the legislation. Brown criticized the bill, saying it was unfairly beneficial to wealthier Americans, increased the deficit, and forced tax cuts to programs such as health care and agriculture. In the August blanket primary, Brown received 45.36% of the vote to 49.29 percent for McMorris Rodgers. As of early August 2018, Brown had raised about $2.4 million and McMorris Rodgers had raised about $3.8 million for their campaigns. In the November general election, Brown was defeated by McMorris Rodges, garnering 44.75% of the vote to McMorris Rodgers' 54.75%. Though she had been mentioned as a potential candidate for Mayor of Spokane, she denied she had any intention of running.  Personal life  Brown married Spokane City Council policy adviser Brian McClatchey on October 9, 2017. The two had met in 2010 while campaigning for Spokane Mayor Mary Verner's re-election campaign. Brown has one child from a previous relationship.

The 08:30 London Paddington to Cardiff Central operated by an InterCity 125 was stopped at a signal guarding the entrance to the Severn Tunnel. On telephoning the signalman according to Rule 55, the driver was advised of a signal failure and given permission to proceed slowly at caution. Three miles into the tunnel, the train was struck from behind by a Class 155 Sprinter travelling from Portsmouth to Cardiff. 185 passengers were injured, including five seriously, but none fatally. Because track circuits were unreliable in the unusually wet tunnel environment (10 to 20 million gallons of water are pumped out per day), axle counters were used instead. The official report into the accident could not reach a firm conclusion, but speculated that the cause was either: * an unaccountable error on the part of the Sprinter driver, or: * technicians in the relay room at Severn Tunnel Junction had reset the axle counter while investigating the earlier fault, thus clearing the signal for the Sprinter.

In most bees, the scopa is simply a particularly dense mass of elongated, often branched, hairs (or setae) on the hind leg. When present on the hind legs, the modified hairs are, at a minimum, on the tibia, but some bees also have modified hairs on the femur and/or trochanter. A few bees have, in addition to the leg hairs, many modified hairs on the ventral surface of the abdomen which are also used in pollen transport; there is one family of bees, Megachilidae, in which the modified leg hairs are absent, and the scopa is limited to the abdominal hairs (see photo). In the familiar honey bees and bumblebees, the scopa is replaced by the pollen basket (corbicula). In the Ptilothrix genus, the notably long scopa allow the members of the genus to collect long grained pollen. Bees have other types of modified hairs used to collect pollen, floral oils, or other chemicals from plants, and these can be on the face, mouthparts, or the front or middle legs, but these are not scopae; the term is explicitly restricted to hairs used to transport pollen. There are some bees which transport pollen internally in the crop, and these lack a scopa, as do cleptoparasitic bees, which do not gather their own pollen.Hodges, Dorothy (1952).

After his forces were heavily defeated within the first few days of the campaign, he was relieved of his command, arrested, charged with military incompetence and executed.Michael Parrish, The Lesser Terror: Soviet State Security, 1939-1953, Praeger/Greenwood, 1996. He was exonerated or, in Soviet parlance, rehabilitated in 1956.  Military career  Pavlov was a veteran of the First World War, as well as the Russian Civil War, serving in the Red Army since 1919. He graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1928. He then commanded various mechanised and cavalry units. As one of the Soviet military advisers, in 1936‚Äì37 he took part in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side (using the nom de guerre PabloBeevor, Antony. The Spanish Civil War. p. 123. ) and commanded a brigade of Soviet tanks, for which he was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. In contrast to many other officers who took part in that war, he was not purged after his return to the Soviet Union,Constantine Pleshakov, Stalin's Folly: The Tragic First Ten Days of World War II on the Eastern Front, Houghton Mifflin Books, 2005. Relevant page available from Google Book Search: Stalin's Folly: The Tragic First Ten ... - Google Book Search at books.google.ca and was made the Head of the Directorate of Tank and Armoured Car Troops of the Red Army which gave him considerable influence on its development. In particular he insisted that tanks be shifted to infantry support roles,Joseph Page and Tim Bean, Russian Tanks of World War II, Zenith Imprint, 2002, Relevant page available via Google Book Search: , Russian Tanks of World War II ... - Google Book Search at books.google.ca which in hindsight turned out to be incorrect. He participated in the Winter War, as well as the border clashes with Japan. In 1940, Pavlov became the commander of the Western (Belorussian) Special Military District, which became the Soviet Western Front bearing the brunt of German attack during Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. On 22 February 1941, he was one of the first Soviet generals to receive the new rank of General of the Army, inferior only to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Downfall In the fall of 1940, Georgy Zhukov started preparing the plans for the military exercise concerning the defence of the Western border of the Soviet Union, which at this time was pushed further to the west due to the annexation of eastern Poland. In his memoirs, Zhukov reports that in this exercise he commanded the Western or Blue forces‚Äîthe supposed invasion troops‚Äîand his opponent was Colonel General Dmitry Pavlov, the commander of the Eastern or Red forces ‚Äìthe supposed Soviet troops. Zhukov describes the exercise as being similar to actual events during the German invasion. At the time, the Eastern, Pavlov's forces had a numerical advantage, but they nonetheless lost the military exercise. During first days of Operation Barbarossa his command, Soviet Western Front suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok-Minsk, during the first days of the invasion, Pavlov was relieved of his command on 1 July 1941, arrested and accused of criminal incompetence and treason. He was the only arrested commander of any Soviet front during Operation Barbarossa. He and his chief of staff Klimovskikh were first accused of: Pavlov and his deputies were accused of \\"failure to perform their duties\\" rather than treason. On July 22, 1941, the same day the sentence was handed down, Pavlov's property was confiscated, and he was deprived of military rank, shot, and buried in a landfill near Moscow by the NKVD. Death penalties were also passed down for other commanders of the Western Front, including the Chief of Staff, Major General Vladimir Klimovskikh; the chief of the communications corps, Major General AT Grigoriev; the Chief of Artillery, Lieutenant General of Artillery A. Klich; and Air Force Deputy Chief of the Western Front (who, after the suicide of Major General Aviation I.I. Kopets, was, nominally at least, Chief of the Air Force of the Western Front), Major General Aviation A. I. Tayursky. Also, the commander of the 14th Mechanized Corps, Major General Stepan Oborin, was arrested on July 8 and shot. The commander of the 4th Army, Major General Aleksandr Korobkov, was dismissed on July 8, arrested the next day and shot on July 22. On the other hand, Pavlov's deputy commander, Lt. Gen. Ivan Boldin, at the head of a small group, became a popular hero at the time after spending 45 days fighting for survival behind enemy lines, and finally, on August 10, leading a total of 1,650 officers and men through to Soviet lines near Smolensk. STAVKA Order No. 270 praised the feat of Boldin's \\"division\\".David Glantz, \\"Ivan Vasilievich Boldin\\", in Stalin's Generals, (Harold Shukman, Ed.), Phoenix Press, 2001, p 49 Pavlov and other commanders of Western Front were rehabilitated as lacking evidence in 1956. On 25 November 1965 he was returned the title Hero of the Soviet Union and other honours. It was not until the Gorbachev era that it was declared that Pavlov was not the main culprit in the defeat and that the orders given to him could not have been fulfilled by anyone.

History Holton Heath has been unstaffed since 1964, with the signal box removed on 3 November 1969. On 20 April 1989 a fatal accident occurred just beyond the siding on the London side of the station, when a light locomotive, which had just completed shunting duties at Winfrith nuclear power station, collided with the rear of a freight train. The driver of the light locomotive, Clive Brooker, died in the accident. Description The platforms are able to accommodate trains of up to five coaches. The station is one of the few remaining on the line not to be equipped with a self-service ticket machine, only a Permit to Travel machine, located on platform 1. Services The station is served hourly by London to Weymouth semi-fast trains during the day. This replaced the now-defunct hourly to Brockenhurst service in 2008. There are no services in the evening (after 20.00) or on Sundays. Until 1967, trains through the station were normally steam hauled. Between 1967 and 1988, passenger services were normally provided by Class 33/1 diesel locomotives with Class 438 coaching stock (also known as 4-TC units). The line was electrified in 1988, using the standard British Rail Southern Region direct current third rail at 750 volts. Class 442 electric multiple units were initially used following electrification, until being displaced by new Class 444 electric multiple units in 2007.

Derives from the verb \\"—á–µ—Ç–∞\\" - \\"to read\\" or \\"—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª\\" - \\"reader\\") is a typical Bulgarian public institution and building that fulfills several functions at once, such as a community centre, library, and a theatre. It is also used as an educational institution, where people of all ages can enroll in foreign language, dance, music and other courses. In this function they could be compared to the folk high schools of Northern Europe. Some larger urban chitalishta are comparable to 92nd Street Y in New York City. The term chitalishte combines the Bulgarian Slavic root, chital- (\\"reading\\") and the suffix -ishte (a place where preceding verb happens). Thus chitalishte literally means \\"reading room,\\" a place where books are kept for public use. The chitalishta of the 19th and early 20th century had a crucial role in preserving and developing Bulgarian culture and thus played an important role during the Bulgarian National Revival. The first institutions of this kind emerged towards the end of the Ottoman era, in 1856 in the towns of Shumen, Lom and Svishtov. Later, the chitalishte became an important multi-purpose institution in villages and smaller towns. Today, chitalishta are less widely spread and have decreasingly critical roles, mostly due to lack of funding. They are evolving and adapting by also hosting public events, and housing cinema halls and other modern organisations. In December 2017 the Bulgaran Chitalishte was Selected on the Register of Good Safeguarding Practices by UNESCO.

Points of interest  = Assyrian Reliefs = In 1857, Amherst College acquired panels from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud. In the palace built around 879 B.C.E., the walls of the ceremonial halls and corridors were decorated with monumental relief carvings. The king Ashurnasirpal II is shown in the central panel wearing a fringed robe and royal headdress. In his right hand, he carries a shallow cup used for pouring offerings to the gods, and in his left hand he holds his bow, symbol of his bravery and military might. The central panel is flanked by panels depicting winged protective spirits called genii, or apkallu (as they are termed in the ancient Akkadian language). The cuneiform inscription, written in a dialect of the Semitic language Akkadian, glorifies the military exploits of King Ashurnasirpal II; his special stature among the gods; and the luxury and grandeur of his building program. Ashurnasirpal II conquered new areas to the west of the Assyrian homeland, beyond the Euphrates River. To emphasize his role as a major powerbroker, he moved the administrative capital from its traditional location at Assur to Kalhu, known today as Nimrud. In addition to his palace, he built temples, administrative buildings, and residences. Population estimates for ancient Kalhu at the time of King Ashurnasirpal run as high as 60,000. British diplomat and explorer Austen Henry Layard (1817‚Äì1894) excavated Nimrud in 1845. Dwight Marsh, an American missionary in Mosul, befriended Layard in 1850 and suggested that educational institutions would benefit greatly from having a few of the panels in their collections. During the early 1850s, panels were selected for and shipped to Amherst, Yale, Bowdoin, Dartmouth, and Middlebury as well as various theological seminaries. Amherst College‚Äôs third president Edward Hitchcock obtained reliefs for Amherst. The twelve-inch thick reliefs were shaved down to about four inches and then cut into squares for easier transport. The total weight of the reliefs is approximately 2 tonnes. They were transported from Nimrud to eastern Mediterranean ports, and then shipped to the United States. When the panels reached Amherst College they were first displayed in the library, but soon were moved to the purpose-built ‚ÄúNineveh Gallery‚Äù attached to the Octagon. = Rotherwas Room = The Rotherwas Room is an English Jacobean-style room currently in the Mead Art Museum, in Amherst College. It was originally installed in the estate of the Bodenham family called Rotherwas Court, in Herefordshire, England, as part of the country house where the family lived. It was commissioned by Sir Roger Bodenham sometime after 1600 and completed in 1611. Some of the room's most prominent aspects include a carved oak mantelpiece and walnut wall panelling. The room originally functioned as a parlor, where families would dine privately or entertain guests informally.Cooper, Nicholas (2006). The Jacobean country house : from the archives of 'Country Life'. London: Aurum. p. 13. . In 1945, Herbert L. Pratt bequeathed the room to the college. It had been previously installed in his Neo-Jacobean House \\"The Braes,\\" in Glen Cove, Long Island. Although the wall panelling and the mantelpiece of the original room remain, no specific records of the furniture or the ceiling design of this room in the original Rotherwas Court house have been found.  Programs  The Mead hosts free programs throughout the academic school year for the Amherst College and Pioneer Valley community. Regular events include exhibition openings, regular Saturday student-led tours, Study At the Mead, a time during Finals and Midterms Weeks where the Mead has food and desks in the galleries for studying, and Community Day, a day of free artmaking, tours, and programs for all. The Mead regularly updates the Mead website, the Mead Facebook page, and the Mead instagram with the latest events.

The phrase shude in Mandarin translates to \\"cultivation of morals.\\" The school has been commended on multiple occasions by municipal and provincial authorities for achieving high average scores for the Gaokao, an important university-entrance exam. History Shude High School was founded as a private school in 1929 by Sun Zhen, who would later become a general in the National Revolutionary Army of the Kuomintang. Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China, in 1950, the school was nationalized and renamed Chengdu No. 9 High School (ÊàêÈÉΩ‰πù‰∏≠). In the 1960s, No. 9 High School of Chengdu served as the middle school for children of the cadres of the Communist Party of China in Chengdu and wider Sichuan Province, as well as a designated school for the children of returned Overseas Chinese. In 1980, Shude High School was honored as an exemplary school. In 1989, the high school celebrated its 60th anniversary and reverted its name from Chengdu No. 9 High School to the current Shude High School. Sun Jingshan (Â≠ôÈùôÂ±±), son of founder Sun Zhen, visited the school from Taiwan and donated to the school's library. In 2000, Shude High School was chosen as a model senior secondary school of China. During 2007-2010, the school expanded and another two campuses was founded (Guanghua campus and Foreign language campus, respectively). In 2013, the school was chosen as a First-level model school of Sichuan Province. Most recently in 2019, current school staffs and alumni celebrated the 90th anniversary of the school at its Foreign language campus. Present With an annual enrollment of 5,000 students at three different campuses, Shude High School attracts elite students from Sichuan province. Every year, in the National College Entrance Examination, the average score of Shude High School ranks as one of the highest in Sichuan province. The basketball team of Shude High School had won the championship in Sichuan Middle School Basketball Cup from 2000 to 2005 and had won third place in Nike National Middle School Basketball Cup. The International Department of Shude High School, jointly set up by Chengdu Shude High School and Chengdu Huaying Consulting and Service Ltd., was accredited by Chengdu Bureau of Education in 2002.

It is down the line from . History The station opened with the Southampton & Dorchester Railway, which later became part of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), in 1847 as Poole Junction, being the junction of the main line with the spur to the port of Poole. At that time the line to then went via , and before following what is now the South Western Main Line from . When the current Poole station opened in 1872, the station was renamed Hamworthy Junction and remained so until the 1970s. A causeway across Holes Bay opened in 1893 enabling through trains from London to Weymouth to serve Poole directly. =Motive Power Depot= A motive power depot with a coal stage was built at the station by the LSWR in 1847. It was closed by British Railways in 1954 and after several years in use as a storage facility, was eventually demolished.Roger Griffiths and Paul Smith, The directory of British engine sheds 1. Oxford: OPC, 1999, 0860935426 p.16 Services The station is served by South Western Railway who currently operate an average of two trains per hour in each direction with trains going to London, Brockenhurst, Wareham and Weymouth. With a journey time of around 4 minutes the train is the fastest method of travel between Poole town centre and the area surrounding the station compared to the Wilts & Dorset bus service which takes around 14 minutes (not including delays caused by Poole Lifting Bridge).Go South Coast Bus Group - Timetable 9, Poole Circular Retrieved 15 August 2016 Until 1967, trains through the station were normally steam hauled. Between 1967 and 1988, passenger services were normally provided by Class 33/1 diesel locomotives with Class 438 coaching stock (also known as 4-TC units). The line was electrified in 1988, using the standard British Rail Southern Region direct current third rail at 750 volts. Class 442 electric multiple units were initially used following electrification, until being displaced by new Class 444 electric multiple units in 2007. Facilities The platforms are able to accommodate trains of up to five coaches. Longer passenger trains are rarely seen past Poole. The station does not have a footbridge but has an underpass that also serves as a public footpath from Turlin Moor to Hamworthy. There was a foot crossing at the Poole end of the station for passenger in wheelchairs or with heavy luggage but this has been removed and access to the platform end fenced off. A light indicating if it is safe to cross remains at the end of platform 1 but is permanently switched off. Hamworthy was one of two South West Trains stations not to receive a Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress self- service ticket machine to replace the former \\"Quickfare\\" (Ascom B8050) machine installed during the Network SouthEast era due to fears of vandalism, although tickets could be bought from the ticket office at certain times of the day and a permit to travel could be purchased at all times. The Quickfare machine was removed in October 2006. South West Trains installed a Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress self-service ticket machine in August 2008 and removed the permit to travel machine. The ticket machine is fitted with a security shutter and casing to protect it from vandalism. This is the junction where the Hamworthy Freight Branch to Poole docks joins the main line. There is a disused third platform at the station facing the Poole docks line. The signal box which controlled the branch was at the Poole end of platform 2 but has since been demolished. Until recently, Hamworthy had the only remaining semaphore signal on the South Western Main Line, but this was removed in May 2014 as part of the signaling upgrade scheme.

In its time, it was an internationally known company. History =Ruston and Hornsby= 1938 Aveling-Barford diesel road roller Aveling-Barford underwent a dramatic revival. First established in 1850 its owners incorporated a limited liability company on 16 July 1895 to hold the business with the name Aveling & Porter. Though Aveling & Porter's operations remained independent in 1919 its shares were sold to a new holding company, Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE).Aveling-Barford Limited. The Times, Wednesday, Jun 30, 1937; pg. 21; Issue 47724 The holding company was unsuccessful and collapsed in 1932. Its fourteen subsidiaries ‚Äî which in the mid 1920s had 10,000 employees ‚Äî were sold by AGE's liquidator and most of them regained their independence. Two subsidiaries, Aveling & Porter and Barford & Perkins, kept on operating profitably throughout the collapse of their parent. Edward Barford of Barford & Perkins also chairman of Aveling & Porter enlisted the help of R. A. Lister & Co and its associate Ruston & Hornsby. Lister and Ruston bought the two companies from the receiver. The products of all four businesses were fitted with diesel engines.Road Roller Firms. The Times, Friday, Dec 02, 1932; pg. 23; Issue 46306. Aveling-Barford dump truck Aveling & Porter immediately took over the activities of Barford & Perkins changing its own name to Aveling-Barford on 13 February 1934. Early in 1934 operations moved from Rochester to a 36-acre site, Invicta Works, on long term lease (to 2009) from Ruston & Hornsby at Grantham. On the board of directors were Edward James Barford and William Geoffrey Barford (from Barford & Perkins), and John Heinrich Wulff Pawlyn, a director of Ruston & Hornsby based at the Ransomes subsidiary in Ipswich, and George Ruston Sharpley, the managing director of Ruston & Hornsby. For many years all the vehicles were powered by R & H diesel engines. R & H had also previously made road rollers, but concentrated this all at Grantham. Aveling-Barford was listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 1937.Stock Exchange. The Times, Tuesday, Jul 06, 1937; pg. 23; Issue 47729 =Public company= In the 1930s it made cooling equipment for dairy farms, and cooking equipment for hotels, hospitals, and canteens. It became a public company on 29 June 1937. At this time it claimed to make 75% of the road rollers in Britain, and world leaders in their field. Edward Barford (23 April 1898 ‚Äì 11 July 1979) became the Chairman of the company from 1933, remaining until 1968. It began making its first earth moving equipment ‚Äì the Aveling Dumper. During the Second World War the company made Bren Gun Carriers, shell fuse caps and the Loyd Carrier. The company also made calfdozers (small bulldozers). From April 1946 two subsidiary companies were formed ‚Äì Barford Developments Ltd and Barford (Agricultural) Ltd. On 17 September 1946 a new factory in Newcastle upon Tyne was opened. =British Leyland= In 1967 it became part of British Leyland. British Leyland engines were to be used as part of the deal, but there were reliability problems. In 1975 Aveling-Barford became Aveling Marshall after BLMC acquired Marshall- Fowler. =Products= Aveling-Barford were best known for their line of three-point roadrollers including the small GA up to the GC, The \\"Master Pavior\\" 3-point roller was one of the most famous diesel rollers. However many other types of earthmoving machinery were designed and manufactured by Aveling Barford in England. A-B were also significant for their all wheel driven and all wheel steering motor graders often using Leyland Trucks running gear as were also producers of ADT models called the RDX Series with 6X6. A line of rigid dumpers was manufactured from 30 tonne RD030 through to the 50 tonne RD050 and eventually a RD55 and RD65 were added. A new dumptruck the RD44 was unveiled at Bauma to try and rejuvenate the line of dumptrucks but with limited success During the 1970s to the 1980s A-B were producing their own range of front loaders with 4X4 axles and are fitted with Cummins, Leyland or Ford heavy duty diesel engines. They resembled the popular British made Bray or Ford loader models of the 1980s. Site dumpers were first mass manufactured by A-B in the 1940s mostly with Fordson Tractor Diesel engines. Today these are still made and sold under the Barford name. =Modern day incarnation= The site was bought by Wordsworth Holdings in 1988, who went into administration in 2010. Barfords is now owned by Invictas Engineering. Update: 12 October 2015 Invictas Engineering sold the Supply of parts to Shellplant www.shellplant.co.uk In 2006 Singapore-based ST Kinetics bought the rights to the Aveling Barford RXD series articulated dumptrucks, which are now sold under the TRX Build brand. In August 2007 Moxy Engineering of Norway announced plans to buy the intellectual property rights of the Barford rigid dump truck range.Moxy 2007 In 2008 Moxy was purchased by the South Korean Doosan (formerly Daewoo), and renamed to Doosan Moxy As and later Doosan Infracore Norway AS. The project was later cancelled and the prototype of the new range earlier presented at Bauma in 2007 was scrapped. Barfords' sports field is still in existence, called Arnoldfield, in Gonerby Hill Foot. In October 2012 Gravity FM, Grantham's community radio station produced a tribute in words and music to Aveling Barford, on sale to raise funds to support the running costs of the station.

It was first described by Ronald Asherson in 1992. The syndrome exhibits thrombotic microangiopathy, multiple organ thrombosis, and in some cases tissue necrosis and is considered an extreme or catastrophic variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome. CAPS has a mortality rate of about 50%. With the establishment of a CAPS-Registry more has been learned about this syndrome, but its cause remains unknown. Infection, trauma, medication, and/or surgery can be identified in about half the cases as a \\"trigger\\". It is thought that cytokines are activated leading to a cytokine storm with the potentially fatal consequences of organ failure. A low platelet count is a common finding. Presentation Clinically, the syndrome affects at least three organs and may affect many organs systems. Peripheral thrombosis may be encountered affecting veins and arteries. Intra-abdominal thrombosis may lead to pain. Cardiovascular, nervous, kidney, and lung system complications are common. The affected individual may exhibit skin purpura and necrosis. Cerebral manifestations may lead to encephalopathy and seizures. Myocardial infarctions may occur. Strokes may occur due to the arterial clotting involvement. Death may result from multiple organ failure. Diagnosis Individuals with CAPS often exhibit a positive test to antilipid antibodies, typically IgG, and may or may not have a history of lupus or another connective tissue disease. Association with another disease such as lupus is called a secondary APS unless it includes the defining criteria for CAPS. Treatment Treatments may involve the following steps: * Prevention includes the use of antibiotics for infection and parenteral anticoagulation for susceptible patients. * Specific therapy includes the use of intravenous heparin and corticosteroids,MD Consult Retrieved on 2009-06-02 and possibly plasma exchanges, intravenous immunoglobulin. * Additional steps may have to be taken to manage circulatory problems, kidney failure, and respiratory distress. * When maintaining survival of the disease treatments also include high doses of Rituxan (Rituximab) to maintain stability.

She was a member of the Rothschild banking family of Naples.  Family  Rothschild was born into the well known Jewish banking family, the Rothschilds. She was the eldest child and only daughter of Carl Mayer Freiherr von Rothschild (1788‚Äì1855) and Adelheid Herz (1800‚Äì1853). Her maternal grandparents were M Moses Isaac Herz (sometspelled sure Hertz) and Clara (n√©e SaloHerz. mon) He.rz She was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on 13 June 1819. Both her parents were Jewish.  Marriage  Because endogamy within the Rothschild family was an essential part of their strategy to ensure that control of their wealth remained in family hands, on 15 June 1836, two days after her seventeenth birthday, Rothschild married Lionel Freiherr de Rothschild (1808‚Äì1879), her first cousin from the English branch of the family. They had the following children: # Leonora (1837‚Äì1911) # Evelina (1839‚Äì1866) # Nathan Mayer (1840‚Äì1915) # Alfred Charles (1842‚Äì1918) # Leopold (1845‚Äì1917) The couple maintained residences at 148 Piccadilly and Gunnersbury Park in London where, in the tradition of the English family, she used the style \\"de\\" Rothschild. Rothschild's arranged marriage flourished for 43 years based on great love and mutual respect. In an era when male and female roles were clearly defined, Charlotte had been better educated in art than her husband and would be instrumental in most of their art assemblage. In 1858, her husband became the first unconverted Jew to sit in the British House of Commons. Charlotte Freifrau de Rothschild became one of England's most prominent socialites whose dinner invitations, according to biographer Stanley Weintraub, were favoured over those from Buckingham Palace. In 1844, the Freifrau caused a sensation in London society when the American showman P. T. Barnum and his celebrated midget \\"Tom Thumb\\" performed at her home. However, beyond socializing and entertaining, Charlotte von Rothschild was a dedicated patron of numerous charities with a special interest in education.

A development of the Catholic Reformation like the Spanish mystics and the Society of Jesus, it focused the devotional life of the Catholic faithful on a personal experience of the person of Jesus and the quest for personal holiness. It was perhaps more concrete than the Iberian example and thus easier to teach, but it shared with the Spanish saints their focus on the Divine Person. This movement in Catholic spirituality had many important figures over the centuries, the first being its founder, Cardinal Pierre de Berulle (1575‚Äì1629). Background Cardinal de Berulle The spiritual and apostolic current of the French school of Spirituality holds a significant place in nearly all the histories of spirituality. B√©rulle's teaching was rooted in the thought of the Church Fathers. Among the characteristics of the movement were: a deep mystical experience, a detailed and well-adapted method for instructing others, and a special concern for the dignity of priests, their holiness and formation. The French clergy of the 17th century were not, for the most part adequately trained, and they received little support from the bishops, many of whom did not even live in their dioceses. Most ordinary Catholics were uneducated and not immune to the influence of superstition and witchcraft. It is difficult to exaggerate the paramount importance of the parish missions, given in rural areas as well as in the cities and even at the court itself. All the leaders of the French school not only took part in them but also clarified the underlying theology of the parish mission. The missionary renewal went hand in hand with an educational renewal and with a multitude of apostolic initiatives. The drawing room of Berulle's cousin, Madame Acarie‚Äôs became a veritable center of Catholic revival. St. Francois de Sales Francis de Sales Francis de Sales's (1576‚Äì1622) influence on the French school was significant. Neither a Frenchman nor an Italian, Francis was a native of Savoy and spent most of his life there between France and Italy. He was in Paris from 1578 to 1588 at the Sorbonne. During his second stay as a bishop in 1602, he gave many sermons and met the circle of Madame Acarie, including perhaps the young Berulle. His third stay, from fall 1618 to late summer 1619, brought him together with Vincent de Paul and Berulle. Francis de Sales and Vincent became friends, and before death, De Sales entrusted the De Paul with responsibility for the Visitandines in Paris.Deville, Raymond S.S. (1990) \\"The Seventeenth-Century School of French Spirituality,\\" Vincentian Heritage Journal Vol. 11: Iss. 1 In his last year of life (1622), while in Lyons, Francis de Sales visited the Olier family and blessed the young Jean- Jacques, an adolescent of fourteen. Before founding the Society of Saint- Sulpice Olier worked the missions under Vincent de Paul. De Sales writings had great influence throughout that period. His Introduction ala vie devote (Introduction to the Devout Life, 1608) went through many editions. Founders Jean-Jacques Olier Pierre de Berulle, Charles de Condren, Jean- Jacques Olier, and Jean Eudes, the four founders of the French school of spirituality were men of many contrasts.Gautier, Jean. Oratorian Spirituality Like his friend, Saint Francis de Sales, Berulle was a renowned director of souls. Addressing himself to advanced souls, his direction was dogmatic in tone. His great concern was to give souls living principles. The Bishop of Geneva, on the other hand, wrote for all kinds of people, beginners as well as those who had made some progress and his direction was psychological and moral, rather than dogmatic. De Sales taught men right living rather than right thinking. Berulle's direction was for the mind, Francis de Sales' was for the heart. Charles de Condren was an early disciple of Berulle and was to succeed him as superior of the Oratory of Jesus. He absorbed his master's teaching, making it his own in his own way. His attraction led him to meditate, above all, on the priesthood and sacrifice of the Savior. Condren's spiritual conferences inspired many, including Jean-Jacques Olier. Jean- Jacques Olier was prepared for his ordination in 1633 by Vincent de Paul. Francis de Sales was a family friend. Condren sent him to work the missions of Auvergne. He is principally known as the founder of both the Seminary and Society of Saint-Sulpice. Jean-Eudes entered the Oratory in 1623, but left after twenty years to found the Congregation of Jesus and Mary. Promoting devotion to the Sacred Heart, he prepared a proper Office and a Mass for the solemnity and octave of the divine Heart of Jesus. In 1648, he published at Autun the first edition of his Office of the Heart of Mary. JeanEudes Theological foundation Berulle was a great theologian and mystic who had a strong influence on his time. Berulle's contribution was the absolute focus on Jesus, the incarnate Word of God, both in his sublime divinity and in his complete debasement as God become man. Centered on this person who abased himself willingly to enter the human estate, the devotional end for the faithful was to abandon all ego and vanity so that the person of Christ might become incarnate in the believer. He introduced the Carmelite nuns to France in 1604 and founded in 1611 he founded the Oratory of Jesus, a group of diocesan clerics whose purpose was to restore the dignity of the priesthood. Recently, it was claimed that Berulle's theology of the priesthood contributed to an over-emphasis of the priest's personal annihilation and transformation in Christ.https://www.worldcat.org/title/berulles-spiritual-theology-of- priesthood/oclc/1033646763&referer;=brief_results Disciples of Berulle One of Berulle's disciples, Jean-Jacques Olier went on to found the Sulpician Order to run seminaries and train future priests in France, Canada and the United States, thus spreading the French school's influence to North America where it would dominate for the next three centuries. Olier's particular strain of the French school's thinking at its most pessimistic is captured in this quote from Olier's Journ√©e chr√©tienne, (Part 1): > It is necessary for the soul to be in fear and distrust of self; ... It > should make its pleasure and joy depend on sacrificing to Jesus all joy and > pleasure which it may have apart from himself. And when taking part in those > things in which by Providence it is obliged to be occupied, such as eating, > drinking, and conversation with creatures, it must be sparing in all, must > discard what is superfluous, and must renounce, in the use of them, the joy > and pleasure to be found therein, uniting and giving itself to Jesus as > often as it feels itself tempted to enjoy something apart from him and not > himself. Fleming, David A., The Fire and the Cloud: An Anthology of Catholic > Spirituality (New York: Paulist Press, 1978), pp. 272-73 Another disciple of Berulle's was Jeanne Chezard de Matel who went on to found the Order of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament in Avignon, France. The express purpose of these cloistered women was to give adoration to Christ incarnate, making liturgy a matter of worshiping God in awe and mystery and through their presence make \\"an extension of the admirable Incarnation.\\"Lozano, John M., Jeanne Chezard de Matel and the Sisters of the Incarnate Word, (trans. Joseph Daries), Claret Center for Resources in Spirituality, Chicago, Illinois, 1983, p.72 It was through Berulle that Vincent de Paul became chaplain to influential Gondi family, through whom De Paul met a host of important people in high society and the Church.Deville, Raymond S.S.

Early life and education Fornander was born in √ñland, Sweden on November 4, 1812, to Anders (1778‚Äì1828) and Karin Fornander (1788‚Äì1872). His education was under his father, a local clergyman, except for two years in 1822 and 1823 when he attended gymnasium in Kalmar, studying Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. His mother's surname was spelled Foenander, so his surname is sometimes spelled that way. In 1828, Fornander began his university studies at the University of Uppsala where he studied theology, transferring to the University of Lund in 1830. However, in 1831, he abandoned university studies to attend to his family, which had fallen under hard times. While thus providing for his family, he met and fell in love with his mother's youngest sister, who was four years his senior. After a short, torrid affair, Fornander was forced to leave in disgrace, and so made his way to the Swedish port of Malm√∂, and then to Copenhagen, from where he set out for the new world. Whaling career The next years are poorly documented, but he later wrote that circumstances in America forced him to go to sea, and it seems he became a whaler for the following decade. He joined the whaleship Ann Alexander in New Bedford in 1841, which set out for what would prove to be a five-year campaign in the Pacific Ocean. In 1844, Fornander deserted his ship in Honolulu. Fornander was to stay in the Hawaiian Islands for the rest of his life. On January 19, 1847, he became a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii as he took an oath of allegiance to Kamehameha III, the Hawaiian king. Also in 1847, he married a Hawaiian chiefess from Molokai named Pinao Alanakapu. The couple had three daughters and two sons, only one of whom survived to adulthood; Catherine (1849‚Äì1905). His wife died four days after giving birth to their son Charles on January 20, 1857, of puerperal fever. Hawaii =Journalism= In Hawaii, Fornander did several things. For a time, he was a surveyor and supervised the coffee plantation of English physician Thomas Charles Byde Rooke. Beginning in 1849, as Hawaii began to consider further constitutional change, Fornander began writing for an upstart paper, the Argus, which he eventually took over. He used his paper to advocate responsible government, improvements to public education, and reform. When the paper failed in 1855, Fornander began a new venture called the Sandwich Islands Monthly, which was to cover both items of local interest and discussion of the great scientific, literary, and theological questions of the day. Although the magazine survived less than a year, a recurring theme in Fornander's writing was a concern for the status and condition of native Hawaiians. Fornander then went to work for The Polynesian, a rival publication that he now edited until its demise in 1864. =Life as a public official= In late 1863, the new Hawaiian king Kamehameha V recognized Fornander's talents and appointed him to the nation's privy council, which were thirty of the most distinguished men in the islands. In May 1864, the King made Fornander a judge, a position that he held for less than a year before he was made superintendent of the Honolulu school district, and then in March 1865, Inspector General of Schools for the entire kingdom. Fornander had long been an advocate of public education, and his administration had three main goals: to put the system on a non-sectarian basis, improve opportunities for girls, and improve the teaching of English. The first of these goals won him the increasing animosity of American Protestant missionaries, who saw his attempt at even-handedness as disguised prejudice. By July 1870, their opposition had become great enough to replace Fornander as Inspector General. The king, however, re-appointed him in May 1871 to the circuit court, a position that he would hold for the next twelve years together with a variety of other governmental boards and commissions. These positions required Fornander to travel a good deal, which allowed him to learn more about Hawaiian mythology and the Hawaiian language. =Account of the Polynesian Race= While undertaking these duties, Fornander had long been developing theories of Hawaiian origins and collecting material for a work setting out his thoughts. In 1877, he finished the first volume of his monumental An Account of the Polynesian Race, its Origin and Migrations, and the Ancient History of the Hawaiian People to the Times of Kamehameha I, which was published in London in the following year. This volume dealt with the hypothesis that the Polynesians were Aryans, both racially and linguistically, who had over the ages migrated through India and the Malay archipelago into the Pacific islands. Basing his theory on the comparison of Polynesian languages, genealogies, and mythology, Fornander estimated that the Polynesians first entered the Pacific in Fiji in the 1st or 2nd centuries AD. When expelled by Melanesians, the inhabitants made their way to Samoa and Tonga, and by AD 400 or 500, to Hawaii, where they lived in isolation until the 11th century, when new groups began to arrive. Fornander paid special attention to legends and genealogies that he thought preserved the history of the Hawaiian islands after their settlement‚Äîtheir external and internal wars, dynastic quarrels, and eventually their contact by Captain James Cook and George Vancouver. He later published more volumes in the series, ending with the final victory of Kamehameha I and the consolidation of his rule over all the islands. The work brought Fornander attention from abroad. He was invited to become a corresponding member of the California Academy of Science in 1878, and in the following year the Hawaiian King made him a Knight Companion of the Royal Order of KalƒÅkaua. In 1880, he was invited to become a correspondent of the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography (Svenska s√§llskapet f√∂r antropologi och geografi). =Later life= Fornander thrived on the international praise that his work had won him, but continued in his various official duties, including serving as acting governor of Maui. In 1886, he began to complain of pain in his mouth, and it soon became clear that he had a malignancy. Although he continued to travel as a circuit judge, the Hawaiian assembly voted him a pension of $1200 per month once he ceased to draw a government salary, together with a $2500 one-time grant to cover expenses incurred in the publication of his research which was described as \\"the most learned work ever written here [and] a credit to the author, to his adopted country, and to the Hawaiian people\\". In November 1886, Fornander was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, the last man ever awarded that honour, and in December, he was made a Knight of the North Star (Nordstj√§rneorden) by Oscar II of Sweden, King of Norway and Sweden. On December 27, 1886, Fornander was appointed an associate justice of the supreme court and he was installed in the position early in the new year. His illness now was too far advanced for him to actually serve. His final months were spent in the home of his only daughter. He died November 1, 1887. Impact and influence The obituaries marking Fornander's death praised his contribution to Hawaii as both a jurist and a scholar. The Hawaiian royal family participated in his funeral, and a memorial in his honour was erected in Honolulu, where it still stands today (near Pensacola Street). His estate left his papers and library to his daughter, who sold them to Charles Reed Bishop. This included over 300 books, in addition to scores of journals, bulletins, and scientific yearbooks. In time the collection passed into the control of the Hawaiian Historical Society, where they still reside. Bishop had also acquired Fornander's own papers and voluminous notes, which he gave to the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, founded in memory of his wife. These papers, recording many chants, folktales, myths, and genealogies, were finally published as the Fornander Collection. These have Fornander's transcriptions in Hawaiian, together with a later English translation edited by Thomas George Thrum on facing pages, and were published from the years 1916 to 1920.

Robinson, Claire Trevor and Humphrey Bogart. It was distributed by Warner Bros. and written by John Wexley and John Huston, based on the 1936 play The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse, the first play written by short-story writer Barr√© Lyndon, which ran for three months on Broadway with Cedric HardwickeIBDB The Amazing Dr. Clittterhouse after playing in London. Plot Dr. Clitterhouse (Edward G. Robinson) is a wealthy society doctor in New York City who decides to research the medical aspects of the behavior of criminals directly by becoming one. He begins a series of daring jewel robberies, measuring his own blood pressure, temperature and pulse before, during and afterwards, but yearns for a larger sample for his study. From one of his patients, Police Inspector Lewis Lane (Donald Crisp), he learns the name of the biggest fence in the city, Joe Keller. He goes to meet Keller to sell what he has stolen, only to find out that \\"Joe\\" is actually \\"Jo\\" (Claire Trevor). The doctor impresses Jo and a gang of thieves headed by 'Rocks' Valentine (Humphrey Bogart) with his exploits, so Jo invites him to join them, and he accepts. Dr. Clitterhouse pretends to take a six-week vacation in Europe. As \\"The Professor\\", he proceeds to wrest leadership of the gang (and the admiration of Jo) away from Rocks, making him extremely resentful. When they rob a fur warehouse, Rocks locks his rival in a cold-storage vault, but Clitterhouse is freed by Butch (Maxie Rosenbloom), a gang member that Jo had assigned to keep watch on him. Afterwards, Clitterhouse announces he is quitting; he has enough data from studying the gang during their robberies, and his \\"vacation\\" time is up. He returns the gang to Rocks' control. However, Rocks learns Dr. Clitterhouse's real identity and shows up at his Park Avenue office. Rocks tries to blackmail the doctor into using his office as a safehouse as they rob the doctor's own wealthy friends. Clitterhouse learns that Rocks will not let him publish his incriminating research, and also realizes that he has not studied the ultimate crime - murder - which will be the final chapter to his book. So, he gives a poisoned drink to Rocks, and he studies his symptoms as he dies. Jo helps dispose of the body in the river, but it is recovered and the poison is detected by the police. The doctor is ultimately caught by his friend Inspector Lane and placed on trial. He insists that he did everything for purely scientific reasons and claims that his book is a \\"sane book\\" and that it is \\"impossible for an insane man to write a sane book\\". His determination to show that he is sane, and therefore willing to face the death penalty, convinces the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. Cast *Edward G.

The battle took place on 5 September 1697, when a French warship commanded by Captain Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville defeated an English squadron commanded by Captain John Fletcher. As a result of this battle, the French took York Factory, a trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company. Prelude Replica of the P√©lican D'Iberville's flagship, P√©lican (44-guns), was part of a larger French squadron dispatched to contest English control of Hudson Bay. D'Iberville commanded Le P√©lican (50 [44] cannons, captain Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville), a 3rd rate man-of-war cut for fifty guns, and with one hundred and fifty men ship's company. Serigny commanded the Le Profond (frigate/'storeship') (460 t, fl√ªte de 32 canons [+2 from Le P√©lican], commanded by Pierre Du Gu√©, Sieur de Boisbriand.). Boisbriant commanded Le Vesp/Weesph (frigate) (Capt. Chatrie (chevalier de Chastrier) a vessel of about 300 t with about 20‚Äì26 guns). Le Palmier (frigate) (5th rate man-of-war, 300t, captain Joseph Le Moyne de Serigny) a vessel of about 20‚Äì26 guns, and originally the \\"Violent\\" renamed L'Esquimau/Esquimaux (the Eskimo), a supply ship (150 ton brigantine) Jean Outelas, Capt., capable of carrying from 10‚Äì12 guns; one report says the last was crushed by the ice pack Before the battle, P√©lican became separated from the rest of the French squadron in heavy fog, but D'Iberville elected to forge ahead. This set the stage for a little-known but spectacular single-ship action against heavy odds. Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville As P√©lican sailed south into clearer weather, she approached the trading post of York Factory, and a group of soldiers went ashore to scout out the fort. Captain D'Iberville remained on board P√©lican. While the shore party was scouting the fort, D'Iberville saw the sails and masts of approaching ships. Thinking the rest of his squadron had arrived, he set off to meet them. D'Iberville realized that the ships were not French, but were, instead, an English squadron when one fired a shot across the bow of Le P√©lican. The English squadron comprised the warship under Captain Fletcher, mounting 50 guns, HBC Royal Hudson's Bay (200 t) commanded by Capt. Nicholas Smithsend and mounting 32 guns, and HBC Dering (a 3rd of this name owned by the HBC) (260 t) (Capt. Michael Grimington) mounting 36 guns. Fireship HMS Owner's Love (217 t) (Capt. Lloyd), which also joined the expedition, was crushed by ice earlier in the passage of the Hudson Strait. Battle D'Iberville, his shore party out of reach, elected to give battle. The battle began as a running fight, but after two and a half hours, D'Iberville closed with the English and a brutal broadside-to-broadside engagement took place between P√©lican and Hampshire. The English seemed to be gaining the upper hand with blood running from the scuppers of P√©lican into the water. Captain Fletcher demanded that D'Iberville surrender, but D'Iberville refused. Fletcher is reported to have raised a glass of wine to toast D'Iberville's bravery when the next broadside from P√©lican detonated Hampshire's powder magazine. Hampshire exploded and sank. Aftermath Hudson's Bay and Dering seem to have played only a limited supporting role in the final stage of the engagement. Hudson's Bay was damaged and struck her colors to P√©lican after Hampshire blew up. Dering broke off the engagement and fled, but P√©lican was too badly damaged to pursue. P√©lican was also fatally damaged in the battle. Holed below the waterline, the ship had to be abandoned, but the arrival of the remainder of the French squadron shortly thereafter led to the surrender of York Factory on September 13, 1697, and the continuation of D'Iberville's remarkable career.
