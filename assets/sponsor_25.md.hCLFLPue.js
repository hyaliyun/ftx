Qubits are used in quantum circuits and quantum algorithms composed of quantum logic gates to solve computational problems, where they are used for input/output and intermediate computations. A physical qubit is a physical device that behaves as a two-state quantum system, used as a component of a computer system. A logical qubit is a physical or abstract qubit that performs as specified in a quantum algorithm or quantum circuit subject to unitary transformations, has a long enough coherence time to be usable by quantum logic gates (c.f. propagation delay for classical logic gates). , most technologies used to implement qubits face issues of stability, decoherence, fault tolerance and scalability. Because of this, many physical qubits are needed for the purposes of error-correction to produce an entity which behaves logically as a single qubit would in a quantum circuit or algorithm; this is the subject of quantum error correction. Thus, contemporary logical qubits typically consist of many physical qubits to provide stability, error- correction and fault tolerance needed to perform useful computations.  Overview  1-bit and 2-bit quantum gate operations have been shown to be universal. A quantum algorithm can be instantiated as a quantum circuit. A logical qubit specifies how a single qubit should behave in a quantum algorithm, subject to quantum logic operations which can be built out of quantum logic gates. However, issues in current technologies preclude single two-state quantum systems, which can be used as physical qubits, from reliably encoding and retaining this information for long enough to be useful. Therefore, current attempts to produce scalable quantum computers require quantum error correction, and multiple (currently many) physical qubits must be used to create a single, error-tolerant logical qubit. Depending on the error-correction scheme used, and the error rates of each physical qubit, a single logical qubit could be formed of up to 1,000 physical qubits.  Topological quantum computing  The approach of topological qubits, which takes advantage of topological effects in quantum mechanics, has been proposed as needed many fewer or even a single physical qubit per logical qubit. Topological qubits rely on a class of particles called anyons which have spin that is neither half-integral (fermions) nor integral (bosons), and therefore obey neither the Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics nor the Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics of particle behavior. Anyons exhibit braid symmetry in their world lines, which has desirable properties for the stability of qubits. Notably, anyons must exist in systems constrained to two spatial dimensions or fewer, according to the spin‚Äìstatistics theorem, which states that in 3 or more spatial dimensions, only fermions and bosons are possible.

Early life Naqvi was born on 1 September 1960 in Gujranwala city located in Punjab province of Pakistan. Judicial career Naqvi has served as inspection judge of Okara District and Gujrat District. He has been an advocate of the high court since 1988 and then went on to become an advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2001. He was appointed as the justice of the Lahore High Court on 19 February 2010. Naqvi is also a member of visiting faculty at Punjab Judicial Academy. In 2013, his decision to grant bail to an accused after rejecting previous two pleas for the same became the reason for a 2014 judgement by Supreme Court of Pakistan in which it issued detailed guidelines for high court judges and magistrates regarding future bail applications. In 2016, he was subject to a show-cause notice from Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan (SJC) due to an alleged misconduct. Naqvi filed a petition challenging the jurisdiction of SJC terming its \\"rules against the spirit of constitution‚Äù. In the same year, his seniority was changed and he was made senior to Muhammad Farrukh Irfan Khan by then chief justice of Lahore High Court Syed Mansoor Ali Shah but that decision was suspended by the supreme court of Pakistan. In 2017, he heard the case to make the model town massacre case report public and directed the Punjab government to do so in result of that hearing. In November 2017, he was taken off of the Punjab Saaf Paani Company case which was pending in his court. Raising an objection to that, he excused himself from hearing another case which was against the detention of Hafiz Saeed saying \\"I'm not going to hear this case, How the judiciary could work independently in such circumstances. Interference in judicial work is very awful.\\" In 2018, he was member of the bench hearing a case against former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in which both of them were accused of making anti-judiciary speeches. During the hearing of that case, Naqvi had a heated argument with the lawyer of the accused over the latter's objection on inclusion of a judge in the bench who was formerly associated with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. As a result of that case, the bench ordered Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority to stop airing the anti-judiciary speeches of Nawaz Sharif and other Pakistan Muslim League (N) leaders. He also headed the bench which sent Waseem Akhtar Shaikh to jail for one month for organizing an anti-judiciary rally. Naqvi headed the contempt of court case against former federal cabinet minister Ahsan Iqbal. Naqvi also headed the bench hearing the case of Preston Institute of Management Science and Technology's students against non- confirmation of their degrees and issued an order to put university's owner on Exit Control List. He was also part of the full bench which heard the contempt of court case against president of Multan branch of Lahore High Court Bar Association, Sher Zaman Qureshi, ordering his arrest which resulted in a riot by lawyers. When Fawad Chaudhry was disqualified from contesting 2018 Pakistani general election by an election tribunal, the bench headed by Naqvi suspended that decision and allowed Chaudhry to contest the election. He was also head of the bench which allowed former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi to contest the 2018 election from NA-57 (Rawalpindi-I) after he was too disqualified by an election tribunal. During a case against Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Naqvi issued bailable arrest warrants for Abbasi when he did not appear in the court on 10 September 2018.

PSLV-C42 successfully carried and deployed 2 earth observation satellites in sun-synchronous orbits at an altitude of . It was launched on 16 September 2018 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from the first launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The two international satellites were launched as part of a commercial arrangement between Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) and ISRO's commercial arm Antrix Corporation Limited, run under the auspices of the Indian Government's Department of Space. Launch PSLV C42 lifting off from First Launch Pad carrying NovaSAR and S1-4 satellites built by SSTL on 16 September 2018 The PSLV-C42 was launched from the first launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota at 10:08 p.m. IST on 16 September 2018, after a 33-hour countdown that began at 1:08 p.m. IST on 15 September 2018. The launch was the 44th flight of the PSLV rocket and the 12th in the Core Alone (CA) configuration. It was the first fully commercial launch of the PSLV rocket in 2018 after a five-month hiatus since its last launch on 12 April 2018, and only the third launch after a rare launch failure on 31 August 2017. The PSLV-C42 carried two United Kingdom earth observation satellites into sun- synchronous orbit, namely NovaSAR and S1-4. Shortly after lift-off, the rocket commenced a short vertical ascent before heading in a south easterly direction. The first stage of the rocket separated nearly two minutes after the lift-off, immediately after which the second stage was ignited. About 3 minutes, 2 seconds following lift off, the payload fairing separated, and the second stage separated about 1 minutes and 21 seconds later. This was immediately followed by the ignition of the third stage, which accelerated the rocket for about 3 minutes and 45 seconds until it separated at 8 minutes, 9 seconds after lift off. The fourth and final stage was then ignited approximately 10 seconds later, which continued powering the rocket until approximately 16 minutes and 57 seconds. Both satellites were subsequently placed in sun-synchronous orbits 17.44 minutes after the launch at an altitude of . R. Hutton, mission director for the PSLV C-42 launch, said: \\"This was a spectacular mission. We have placed the satellite in a very, very precise orbit\\". The PSLV-C42 launch was a night time mission and was carried out for the first time by ISRO upon the request by the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), whose satellites were launched, in order to achieve a specific orbit. \\"This unique mission is mainly for 'ascending daytime node' launch. This is the first time we have executed a different type of mission altogether,\\" said Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of ISRO.

In 1852, he returned to Vermont, where he would learn photography, specifically how to make daguerreotypes, alongside his brother, George Irving Hazeltine. The two brothers left Vermont in 1853, taking a ship from New York, arriving in San Francisco two months later, where they would open a photography studio. In 1855, the brothers closed their studio to pursue their own individual goals. Hazeltine married Barbara Fabing in 1855. =Success in landscape photography= A stereoscope by M. M. Hazeltine taken in Comptche, California Hazeltine pursued a career in landscape photography, traveling throughout the American West to capture Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, and California, including Yellowstone National Park. He also visited Alaska. Starting in the 1860s he shifted his focus towards California, which would remain his primary subject for almost twenty years. He had a summer home in Yosemite National Park and a winter home in Mendocino County. He entered into business with John James Reilly in June 1876, becoming the primary photography studio for Yosemite Valley. One year, two of Hazeltine's children would die of small pox. Hazeltine opened a photography gallery in Reno, Nevada in 1878 and in Boise, Idaho in 1883. In 1880, he visited Baker City, Oregon and four years later he opened a sister gallery to the one in Boise. =Later life= Hazeltine settled in Baker City, remaining there for the rest of his life. He died on February 16, 1903 at his Baker City home. Legacy A selection of Hazeltine's stereographs reside in the collection of Claremont College, primarily focused around Yosemite Valley and northern California. Additionally, Hazeltine's works are found in the collections of the Oregon Historical Society, the Bancroft Library, and Princeton University. Further reading *Palmquist, Peter E. and Thomas R.

The film's music is composed by Basil C J. while the screenplay is based on a story written by Sajin Babu. The film portrayed the real life of a sexagenarian in a very natural way. It was nominated for the Kerala State Film Award 2016.  Plot  The film revolves around the life of a sexagenarian named Sassi Namboothiri. He is a carefree person with no family baggage. He has a gang of friends for whom he conducts parties in his home every weekend. He is known to the people as an artist. He makes his living by purchasing drawings from fine arts college students and selling them at higher cost with his name signed to those pictures. Later it becomes known that Sassi is suffering from fourth stage liver cancer due to his drinking habit and has only six months to end his life. He chooses to put his trademark on earth by ordering for a \\"smart\\" coffin to cremate him and converts to Christianity for the same. Later problems arise when some critics raise the issue that the coffin is much bigger than the original one and cannot be allowed to be cremated. He feels that all his efforts have gone in vain and leaves the place. On the way he leaves the coffin to float in the water and moves away with his life.

by . With a length of 808 minutes excluding intermissions, it is the longest film in the history of Argentine cinema. The film is a joint project by the production group El Pampero Cine and the acting company Piel de Lava, made up of actresses Elisa Carricajo, Valeria Correa, Pilar Gamboa, and Laura Paredes. It premiered at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema. Plot La Flor is broken into six separate episodes, connected only by an on-screen appearance by Llin√°s explaining the film's structure. The first four episodes have the beginning of a story but finish in medias res. The fifth episode is the only one to proceed from start to end, and the last episode has just the conclusion of a story. The first episode is shot as a B movie, where a group of researchers encounter a mummy and its supernatural curse. The second episode has two parallel plots. One follows a couple that has broken up as they reunite to record a song together, and the other is a mystery about a secret society formulating a potion for eternal life using a supposedly extinct scorpion. The third episode is about a group of spies, with extended flashbacks describing each of their backstories. The fourth episode uses an experimental metanarrative in which the four lead actresses play actresses who turn against their director and his elaborate narrative structure. After the director disappears, an investigator develops a theory about the actresses after reading Arthur Machen's translation of Casanova's memoirs. The fifth episode is a black-and-white, largely silent remake of Jean Renoir's Partie de campagne. The sixth episode is told through the diary of an Englishwoman living in the Americas during the nineteenth century. She and three other women leave the desert after being held captive many years. Release In the United States and Canada, La Flor was released on November 1, 2019, alongside Harriet, Terminator: Dark Fate and Motherless Brooklyn.

Tourism is one of the major components of economic growth for communities worldwide. A key requirement of tourism has been to attract more and more tourists from different parts of the world. Smart tourism refers to the application of information and communication technology, such similar to the smart cities, for developing innovative tools and approaches to improve tourism. Smart tourism is reliant on core technologies such as ICT, mobile communication, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. It supports integrated efforts at a destination to find innovative ways to collect and use data derived from physical infrastructure, social connectedness and organizational sources (both government and non-government), and users in combination with advanced technologies to increase efficiency, sustainability, experiences. The information and communication technology tools used for smart tourism include IoT, mobile communication, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It combines physical, informational, social, and commercial infrastructure of tourism with such tools to provide smart tourism opportunities. The principles of smart tourism lie at enhancing tourism experiences, improve the efficiency of resource management, maximize destination competitiveness with an emphasis on sustainable aspects. It should also gather and distribute information to facilitate efficient allocation of tourism resources and integrate tourism supplies at a micro and macro level ensuring that the benefits are well distributed. They are observed to be effective in technologically advanced destinations such as smart cities.  Smart Tourism Destinations  Any destination can be a smart tourist destination if it consists of the following; * Soft smartness; includes collaborations, innovation, and leadership * Hard smartness; refers to all the technology and infrastructure However, the availability of any of the above does not make for a smart destination. It depends on the availability of hardsmartness which enables improvement of human capital and smart decisions based on the application of technology and infrastructure. Smart tourism requires the following attributes: # Technology embedded environments # Responsive processes at micro and macro levels # End-user devices # Stakeholders that actively use smart platforms  Smart Tourism Tools  Smart tourism tools refer to a combination of mobile hardware, software, and networks to enable interaction between tourists, stakeholders, and physical objects. The communication must be able to provide personalized services and real-time information for making smart decisions. Three specific smart tourism tools are mobile applications, augmented reality, and near-field communications. = Applications = Applications must be able to provide information which will help tourists in making informed choices such as making reservations, translation services, direction guidance. Audio guidance, etc.. It should also allow real-time communication between stakeholders and customers. Examples include ViaHero which allows users to have personalized trips created with the help of local residents. = Augmented Reality = It is an experience augmenting a real- world environment with information with the help of smartphone or lens systems. It can contribute significantly to cultural tourism. An example includes AR at a Roman theater which allows users to point their phone at the arena and watch a gladiator fight. = Near Field Communications = NFC can be mostly used mostly in tourist places such as museums and which allows tourists to scan information points at paintings/ sculptures/ historical artifacts which then allows the phone to provide translations. The NFC however, requires a compatible device. Each location calls for the application of different tools. Both tourists and destinations benefit from smart tourism. Benefit for destinations includes economic reward, potential FDI, preservation of cultural heritage, etc. while for the tourists include convenience, reduction in expenses, to name a few.  Challenges of Smart Tourism  Reliance on smart devices for running applications and power for the functioning of the system. The existence of a gap between digital and non- digital devices. It does not cater to the needs of those who want to experience tourism outside of the smart city realm. Higher amounts of knowledge and infrastructure. Enterprises which are already affected by tourism will be further pushed down with the onset of smart tourism.

The investor, Maurice Kanbar held the building until 2012, when he sold it, as part of a package, to Stuart Price, one of his associates. The new owner decided to repurpose the building from corporate offices to luxury apartments, and spent several years thoroughly renovating the interior. He also renamed the building Art Deco Lofts and Apartments. Apartment buyers began moving into the building in mid 2016. Building history Arthur M. Atkinson was the principal architect for the building when it was constructed in 1928-9.\\"Arthur M. Atkinson, AIA (1891-1949).\\" Tulsa Foundation for Architecture. 2018. Accessed September 17, 2018. Joseph R. Koberling Jr. was the designer.

Accessed October 4, 2018. Structure The building is constructed of reinforced concrete, with a structural steel frame, and a covering of light gray Bedford limestone. All the windows have steel frames. The ground floor has large display windows, since PSO also promoted and sold electric appliances during its early life, to promote its main product - electricity. These display windows are decorated with Gothic-type arches, which were often used in a predecessor of Art Deco style.\\"Public Service of Oklahoma Building.\\" Tulsa Preservation Commission. Undated. Accessed September 18, 2018 PSO reportedly instructed Atkinson and Koberling that they should feature exterior lighting, which was a novel concept in 1929. Repurposing the building Soon after this building was purchased in 2005 by California by California real estate investor Maurice Kanbar, PSO moved its headquarters to the former Tulsa Central High School Building, which had already moved into a new building in northwest Tulsa. Kanbar held the almost empty building until 2012, when he sold it to a former business partner, Stuart Price. About that time, it was announced that the building would be repurposed - in this case converted to a residential facility. The upper stories of the interior would be rebuilt to create 37 luxury studios and apartments, ranging in size from to .\\"PSO / TransOk Building.\\" TulsaNow. April 29, 2016. Accessed September 30, 2018. At the end of July, 2016, the building had been renamed Art Deco Lofts and Apartments, and the newest residents began moving in. Restructuring of the energy industry created a substantial glut of office space in Tulsa during the late 20th Century and early 21st Century, as companies downsized their Tulsa operations. Many companies moved entire operations to other cities, especially Houston. Many large, well-known buildings soon became vacant, and were put up for sale by the former owners. Professional real estate developers moved in to buy up many of these distressed properties.

Background The C·ª≠a Vi·ªát River served as a vital supply line for the 3rd Marine Division in northern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, running from the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát Base to the ƒê√¥ng H√† Combat Base which in turn supported the Marine bases along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The C·ª≠a Vi·ªát area was part of the Napoleon/Saline operational area with the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion responsible for securing the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát Base and its vicinity. The 1st AMTRAC Battalion had operational control of a rotation of Marine infantry battalions. Battle Battle of Dai Do, 30 April - 3 May 1968 In late April, 4 People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) Battalions, including 2 from the 320th Division, infiltrated past the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Regiment to occupy the area around Dai Do () 2.5 km northeast of ƒê√¥ng H√†. The PAVN moved into a series of pre-built mutually supporting bunkers surrounded by barbed wire which had been built over the preceding weeks unnoticed by the ARVN who were responsible for security in the area. At 03:30 on 30 April PAVN in the hamlet of An Loc () fired on a United States Navy PBR, which returned fire and then returned to ƒê√¥ng H√† Base. At 04:00 the PAVN opened fire on an LCU causing severe damage and killing 1 sailor. At 07:00 a patrol from Company H, 2/4 Marines operating north of Dai Do was sent to investigate the area. Two platoons from Company F were ordered aboard AMTRACs to move to join Company H. As Company H advanced towards the suspected PAVN position they came under heavy machine gun, mortar and rocket fire from across a stream in the hamlet of Dong Xuan (). Company H was withdrawn to await the arrival of the Company F reinforcements. The reconnaissance platoon and 2 M48s were also sent as reinforcements. The Marines called in air and artillery strikes which were reported to have knocked out 3 PAVN machine guns and Company H crossed the stream 400m northwest of Dong Xuan. Company F riding on AMTRACs crossed the stream west of Company H and positioned itself to attack Dai Do. At 14:00 both companies launched their attack and by 15:00 Company H had secured Dong Xuan. Company F's attack on Dai Do was stopped some 300m short of the hamlet, recoilless rifle fire had knocked out 2 AMTRACs, while mortar and machine gun fire had stopped the infantry advance. An attempt to reinforce Company F by landing Company G nearby was stopped when PAVN forces attacked Company G's landing zone near Lam Xuan. At 16:25 Company B 1/3 Marines aboard AMTRACs landed south of An Loc under cover of Task Force Clearwater gun boats. Company B was met by intense fire which destroyed 1 AMTRAC and disabled another, nevertheless Company B captured half of An Loc hamlet until its advance was brought to a halt and its commanding officer killed. 1st AMTRAC Battalion commander, Colonel Hull ordered Company F to withdraw from Dai Do and join Company H in Dong Xuan so the Marines would only have 2 perimeters to defend overnight. That night the PAVN probed the Company F/H position at Dong Xuan but were deterred by Marine artillery. Marines losses for the day were 16 dead while PAVN losses were 90 dead. The 2/4 Marines commander Lieutenant colonel William Weise felt that inadequate resources were provided for the attack on Dai Do, both in terms of men and air and artillery support. Major general Rathvon M. Tompkins the 3rd Marine Division commander could not be sure whether this was the main thrust of the May Offensive along the DMZ or a diversion for a larger attack still to come, however by the end of 30 April it was clear that the PAVN intended to either attack ƒê√¥ng H√† Base or move through the area and attack Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. With limited Marine reserves available, Tompkins requested Army reinforcements from I Field Force commander Lieutenant general William B. Rosson who sent the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment to a landing zone north of ƒê√¥ng H√† on the morning of 1 May. On the morning of 1 May Company B patrols in An Loc found that the PAVN had deserted the hamlet overnight. Outside the hamlet they saw a group of approximately 60 PAVN moving across paddyfields north of An Loc and opened fire on them in what was described as a \\"turkey shoot\\". While artillery fire continued to be directed at Dai Do, at 10:00 Company G and 2 M48s were landed by LCMs at An Loc and moved west through Company B's positions to attack Dai Do. Company G was met by intense fire from the entrenched PAVN and had to knock out each bunker one by one, eventually reaching the north of Dai Do by 14:00 after having suffered heavy losses and both tanks being immobilized. The PAVN then counterattacked from the north and west of Dai Do and from bypassed positions to the south forcing Company G to withdraw and establish a perimeter east of Dai Do. A large PAVN force, including an artillery spotter team was observed in the hamlet of Truc Kinh () 3km northeast of Dai Do and airstrikes were directed on them resulting in a decline in the effectiveness of PAVN artillery fire. Company F at Dong Xuan attempted to move south to support Company G but was stopped by PAVN fire and returned to Dong Xuan. At 17:00 Company B in An Loc was ordered to move west to support Company G but was stopped by PAVN fire which injured their replacement company commander. Company B was ordered back to An Loc where it linked up with Company E which had marched south along Highway 1 and then northeast across the stream. Marine losses for the day were 24 dead while PAVN losses were 91 dead and 2 captured. At 05:00 on 2 May Company E attacked northeast from An Loc towards Company G's position near Dai Do in the face of heavy PAVN fire. Meanwhile Company G attacked PAVN positions in southern Dai Dao knocking out bunkers with White Phosphrous grenades, Satchel charges and M72 LAWs. By 09:30 Companies E and G had secured Dai Do. With Dai Do secured, the Marines sought to squeeze the PAVN with a Hammer and anvil approach, while an ARVN mechanized battalion would secure the hamlets of Dong Lai and Thong Nghia () and establish blocking positions, the Marines would attack northwest taking the hamlets of Dinh To () and Thuong Do (). At 13:00 Company H attacked northwest from Dai Do towards Dinh To in the face of heavy PAVN fire which stalled their advance through the hamlet, the PAVN then counterattacked and the company commander radioed that he was in danger of being overrun. Company E, although numbering only 30 men, immediately moved forward to support Company H, pushing forward into the PAVN defenses until a large PAVN counterattack stopped their advance and threatened to overwhelm them. Both companies were ordered back to Dai Do under the cover of Marine airstrikes. Hull liaised with the ARVN mechanized battalion which was now west of Dai Do and it was agreed that they would advance 1km north to Thong Nghia while the Marines renewed their attack on Dinh To. At 16:00 the attack on Dinh To resumed with Company G (now down to 40 men) in the lead, followed by Company F (80 men). Company G pushed through the now lightly defended Dinh To and had reached the outskirts of Thuong Do when it was stopped by PAVN fire from across the stream which still had not been reached by the ARVN. Company F advancing slightly further east meanwhile had met heavy PAVN fire and become separated from Company G. The PAVN then counterattacked at Thuong Do and Company G fought back surrounded by a wall of Marine artillery fire, eventually withdrawing to meet up with Company F and both companies then withdrew to Dinh To and then Dai Do. Marine losses for the day were 40 dead while PAVN losses were almost 380. File:Battle of Dai Do, morning of April 30, 1968.svgMorning of April 30. Attacks by companies H and F.

Aftermath On the morning of 3 May the PAVN had largely abandoned the Dai Do area. BLT 1/3 Marines relieved BLT 2/4 Marines and swept through Dinh To and Thuong Do meeting no resistance. The Marines had lost 81 killed in the battle while the PAVN had lost at least 600 killed. Company E commander Captain James E. Livingston and Company G commander Captain Jay R. Vargas were each awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle, while 2/4 Marines commander Weise was awarded the Navy Cross. The ARVN had lost 5 dead and killed 39 PAVN in their advance to Thong Nghia. The PAVN have never released their casualties for Dai Do, but claimed victory stating that they had defeated 3 Marine Battalions and elements of the non-existent US 73rd Air Cavalry Brigade on 2 May, killing over 500 Americans. Max Hastings writing in 2018, described Dai Do as an \\"act of sustained folly,\\" blaming Hull and Tompkins for not appreciating the tactical situation and continuing with costly frontal attacks on 1 and 2 May. Weise stated \\"I don't believe Tompkins ever realized what was going on.\\" References External links *Video of the battle Conflicts in 1968 Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 May 1968 events History of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province ","title":"Battle of Dai Do"},{"id":"58514345","title":"Drip Harder"},{"id":"58514347","text":"Kutlug Timur minaret is a minaret in Konye-Urgench in north Turkmenistan, Central Asia.

The project began in November 2016, and an animated music video by Doga Kobo was released on March 15, 2017. They also have live concerts and events with the characters' voice actresses.  Summary  Onsen Musume are minor goddesses who live in every onsen. During the day Onsen Musume go to school in Odaiba, Tokyo to learn how to help more people learn about each Musume's respective onsen, and also to learn special arts that help guests relax and smile. One day they receive a proclamation from Sunahiko, the god who rules over all of the onsen, commanding them to become idols. The Onsen Musume form idol groups in order to compete in the newly- created idol tournament. The main character of the series is Yuina Kusatsu, the Onsen Musume for Kusatsu Onsen. With eight other Onsen Musume, she forms an idol group called \\"SPRiNGS\\". In school the nine members are known as the \\"weird ones\\", but as idols they aim to become the best Onsen Musume idol group in Japan.

The viaducts were designed and built by the New South Wales Government Railways. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The first section of railway built in New South Wales was opened as a single line from the Cleveland Paddocks (near Cleveland Street overbridge) to a site west of Granville on 26 September 1855. It was duplicated by June 1856. The largest structure on the line was the 8-span stone arch viaduct over Long Cove Creek on the western side of Petersham. By the 1880s deterioration lead to its replacement by three pairs of Whipple trusses, they were American type wrought iron, pin-jointed deck trusses. The bridge was only one of two bridges in NSW to employ the Whipple Truss (the other being a road bridge over the Shoalhaven River at Nowra). These were subsequently replaced by welded, deck plate web girders in 1993. A pair of the Whipple trusses are on display on the southern side of the Lewisham Viaduct. Two more tracks (quadruplication) were added in 1892 using three double track deck trusses of the British lattice type. These were also replaced by welded, deck plate web girders in 1998. Two further tracks were added for the sextuplication during 1925-27, on the northern side of the viaduct, for which three pairs of riveted steel, deck Warren trusses were erected. They are still in use.  Description  The Lewisham viaducts trusses are located west of Lewisham Station. The structure which comprises recently installed plate web girders and original Warren trusses carries local, suburban and main lines over Long Cove Creek. The original Whipple trusses which have been replaced by the plate web girders have been removed and displayed adjacent to the viaducts. The viaducts include several structures: * Girders: plate web girders on local lines (1993) * Girders: plate web girders on suburban lines (1998) * Trusses: Warren trusses on main lines (1926) * Display Trusses: Whipple trusses displayed under viaduct (1886) =Girders (on local lines)= There are three pairs of double track, welded plate web girders which carry two local lines over Long Cove Creek. Each span of steel girders is and are supported by brick piers and abutments. =Girders (on suburban lines)= There are three pairs of double track, welded plate web girders which carry two suburban lines over Long Cove Creek. The girders are made of steel and are supported on brick piers and abutments. =Trusses (on main lines)= There are three pairs of single track deck Warren trusses which carry the main lines over Long Cove Creek. Each span is and supported by brick piers and abutments. =Display (displayed under viaduct)= A pair of original Whipple trusses has been retained on site. These are wrought-iron, pin-jointed deck trusses which were developed in America. Archaeological potential The Lewisham viaducts have moderate archaeological potential. Any evidence of the 1882 Lattice trusses on the suburban lines has been removed when replacement with plate web girders in 1998. However the pair of original 1886 Whipple trusses that have been retained on site and put on display under the viaduct, and provide evidence of the historic structures that were employed over the viaducts.  Condition and integrity  All girders and trusses were reported to be in good condition as at 1 September 2010. The integrity of the Lewisham viaduct as a whole is considered to be moderate. The original 1926 Warren trusses carrying the main lines over the viaducts have been retained in their original condition and functioning. However the removal of the original Whipple and Lattice trusses and their replacement with modern plate web girders has reduced the integrity of the viaducts.  Modifications and dates  * 1928: Local and Suburban lines electrified to Homebush. * 1955: Main lines electrified to Homebush. * 1993: Whipple truss spans replaced.  Heritage listing  Lewisham viaduct over Long Cove Creek has state significance as the site of different railway underbridges which represent significant phases in the development of the NSW railways. At the time of its construction it was the largest bridge on the line; the subsequent use of the extant Whipple Trusses (on display on-site) was historically significant as it was one of only four bridges in NSW to employ such Trusses; the addition of the existing Warren Trusses to the north side of the viaduct dates from the 1926-27 sextuplication of the line. The viaduct with the Warren Trusses which has remained largely intact forms a significant landmark in the local area. The viaduct is also significant for its association with NSW Railways Engineer-in- Chief John Whitton and his successor George Cowdery. Lewisham Railway viaducts over Long Cove Creek was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Lewisham viaduct over Long Cove Creek has historical significance at a state level as the site of different railway underbridges which represent significant phases in the development of the NSW railways. The stone arch viaduct built during the first phase of NSW railway construction in the 1850s was the largest structure on line; its subsequent replacement with Whipple Trusses in the 1880s was historically significant as it was one of only four bridges in NSW to employ such trusses; the 1890s addition of British lattice deck trusses to accommodate extra tracks represented the 1892 quadruplication of the line and the 1920s addition of currently used Warren Trusses to the north side of the viaduct demonstrated the 1926-27 sextuplication of the line. The currently displayed Whipple Truss on site and the extant Warren Trusses are able to collectively demonstrate the growth of the railways during the late 19th and early 20th century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Lewisham viaduct is significant for its association with NSW Railways Engineer-in-Chief John Whitton who was responsible for encouraging the use of Whipple Trusses at the underbridge in the 1880s. His successor George Cowdery was influential in implementing the use of Warren Trusses for the 1920s sextuplication. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Lewisham viaduct with the Warren Trusses which has remained largely intact has local aesthetic significance as it forms a significant landmark in the local area. The viaduct has state technical significance as at the time of its construction in the 1850s, it was the largest structure on line and to date it is the largest underbridge on this section of the railway. The Whipple Truss displayed on site and the Warren Trusses which are still in use exemplify the technology employed for railway underbridges during the late 19th and early 20th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Lewisham viaduct has moderate research potential as the pair of original 1886 Whipple trusses that have been retained and put on display adjacent to the viaduct have a high level of integrity and are able to provide evidence of late 19th century engineering technology that was employed on two sites within NSW. The historic engineering marker placed on site by the Institution of Engineers Australia demonstrates that the site is a benchmark in terms of the engineering technology that was used for the viaducts. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Lewisham viaduct has rarity in terms of the Whipple trusses as the Lewisham viaduct was one of two such bridges in NSW which employed the Whipple Truss, the other being a road bridge over the Shoalhaven River at Nowra. Similarly the extant and operational Warren Trusses are rare on the New South Wales railway system. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Lewisham viaduct is representative of Warren trusses bridge construction.

Wellcome Collection. Retrieved 26 October 2018. The Soviet‚ÄìGerman Syphilis Expedition was a joint Soviet and German expedition that took place in 1928. It comprised eight medical researchers from each country and its purpose was to investigate endemic syphilis in the Kul‚Äôskoe region of the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomous Republic in Siberia and to determine the efficacy of the anti-syphilis drug Salvarsan. The expedition concluded, contrary to expectations, that although affected by poor sanitation and lifestyle, the spread of syphilis in the area was caused primarily by sexual activity.

The organism causing syphilis was identified in 1905 by dermatologist Erich Hoffmann and zoologist Fritz Schaudinn. The Wassermann test for syphilis and the anti-syphilis drug Salvarsan were developed soon after. In 1956, Pyotr Vasilievich Kozhewnikov of the Institute of Advanced Medical Studies for Physicians in Leningrad wrote that before 1917 there were no planned methods of syphilis control in Russia despite the disease being widespread there. After the Russian Revolution the Soviet government started a large-scale programme to monitor the disease, using \\"expeditions\\" to remote regions to gather information. There were more than 1,000 \\"expeditions\\" between 1917 and 1940.  The expedition  Traditional Buryat yurt. Ethnographic Museum, Ulan Ude. Soviet and German syphilis researchers at Kul'skoe, Summer 1928. Planning for the Soviet‚ÄìGerman Syphilis Expedition started in 1924, one year after Buryatia became an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union. The chosen target, Kul‚Äôskoe, was 200 kilometers north of the capital, Verchne Udinsk (now Ulan-Ude). The degree of syphilis in the area had been mapped out over the previous few years and found to have a prevalence of between 42 and 63% of the population. The expedition was jointly organised by the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft headed by Friedrich Schmidt-Ott, the commissariat for public health service (Department of Venereal Disease) of the USSR and the Russian Academy of Sciences.\\"Syphilis Research in Asiatic Russia\\", Journal of Social Hygiene, Vol. 14 (1928), p. 431. A pilot study was conducted in 1926 and the full expedition took place in 1928. It comprised eight medical researchers from each country and its purpose was to investigate endemic syphilis in the Kul‚Äôskoe region and to determine the efficacy of the anti-syphilis drug Salvarsan. The Buryats, whose religion prohibited bathing, were chosen as subjects because they were seen as a \\"primitive race\\" within which the disease was known to be widespread. German dermatologist Max Jessner took a leading role in the expedition. The researchers used questionnaires and interviews to gather information about the sexual activity of the Buryats as well as matters such as alcoholism and classifying people according to age and marital status. The resulting information was translated and transcribed as many of the respondents were illiterate.  Conclusions and legacy  The expedition provoked disputes as the Soviets and Germans had different motives for participating which was reflected in difficulties preparing the joint report of the expedition.\\"Infertile Soil: Heinz Zeiss and the Import of Medical Geography to Russia, 1922-1930\\" by Susan Gross Solomon in Susan Gross Solomon (Ed.) (2006). Doing Medicine Together: Germany and Russia Between the Wars. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 240‚Äì290 (p. 274). Previously, the cause of syphilis in the Buryat people was felt to be primarily \\"non-venereal\\", that is, not thought to be transmitted through sexual contact. The Soviet researchers determined, contrary to expectations, that in the case of the Buryats, the disease was mainly transmitted through sexual activity.\\"Innocence and Sexuality in Soviet Medical Discourse\\" by Susan Gross Solomon in Rosalind Marsh (Ed.) (1996) Women in Russia and Ukraine. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 121‚Äì130 (p. 127). They did not discount the influence of poor sanitation and lifestyle, but with their methods on contact tracing, placed a greater onus on the spread of syphilis through sexual activity. The sexual habits of the Buryats, beginning early in life, being casual and short term, were more significant. The researchers also took note of the economic and social conditions affecting Buryat society and saw potential for change. According to Francine Hirsch, \\"Both research groups portrayed the \\"Buryats as a 'primitive' people with a 'backward' culture who were in danger of extinction.\\" The German theory that syphilitic Buryats were different to syphilitic Europeans was not demonstrated as the treatment with salvarsan showed no difference in efficacy between the two peoples. The expedition was seen as essentially two expeditions with two agendas and it ended after only three months. The Lilly Library hold six volumes of photographs from the expedition.Jessner mss.

It was designed by A. Phipps Coles. Originally built in 1927 for the Scottish Royal Arch Temple in College Street, Sydney, it was re-erected in 1977 at the Royal Arch Temple in Petersham. Craftsmen who worked on the room included G. Raynor Hoff (sculptor), Charles Everett (decoration) and G. R. Lumb and Sons (plaster modelling). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Egyptian Room was originally built within the Scottish Royal Arch Temple at 22-24 College Street Sydney (now replaced by Anzac House) in 1927, on the basis of a design by the architect Mr A. Phipps Coles. The sculptor was Mr G Rayner Hoff, best known for his work on the Sydney War Memorial. The decorator was Charles Everett and the plaster modelling was undertaken by G.R. Lumb and Sons. Painters from Lumb and Sons painted the original vignettes. When the original Masonic Temple in College Street was to be demolished in 1969 the plaster work was carefully removed and placed in storage. The Grand Superintendent, Dr F.J. Radcliff, planned the relocation of the Egyptian Room and eventually a suitable space was found in the Royal Arch Temple in Petersham. The Egyptian Room was re-erected in 1977 by craftsmen from G.R. Lumb and Sons, the firm which had originally constructed it. The Egyptian Room was classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in August 1979.Tillett 1987 Following its National Trust classification the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Freemasons of Scotland nominated the interior of the Egyptian Room for a Permanent Conservation Order in October 1979. Following consideration by the Heritage Council of NSW a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over it on 12 December 1980. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Located within the Scottish Royal Arch Masonic Temple is the \\"Egyptian Room\\" that is decorated in the style of Ancient Egypt, with a magnificent frieze reproducing illustrations from the Papyrus of Ani, an Egyptian funerary text of about 1450 BC. The decorations are sculpted in low relief plaster and painted in rich colours carefully chosen for their authenticity. The major feature of the Egyptian Room is the frieze which depicts the funeral procession and burial rites of the scribe, Ani, together with the after-death trials of his soul before the gods. These scenes come from a version of what is popularly known as \\"The Book of the Dead\\", but which, in fact is entitled \\"The Book of Coming Forth By Day\\" - that is, the day of the after-life. Such papyri were intended as \\"guide books\\" for the soul in its after-death condition so that it could negotiate the perils which it would be encountering in the world beyond the grave. The Egyptian texts, which have been found in tombs from around 1600 to 1300 BC assume that the dead person's ka (or spirit body) will encounter various trials (including demons of various forms), before facing judgement and (hopefully) resurrection into a new life. The Papyrus of Ani, from which the vignettes around the Room have been accurately reproduced, was acquired by the British Museum about 1935 and had been written in the 18th Dynasty (about 1450 BC) for Ani, \\"Veritable royal scribe, scribe and accountant of the offerings of all the gods, governor of the granary of the Lords of Abydos, scribe of the offerings of the Lords of Thebes\\". His wife Tutu, a member of the royal college of singers in the temple of Amen-Ra at Thebes had died some years before him, but she appears in some of the vignettes. Selections from the papyrus, which measures some seventy-eight feet - were made for reproduction around the Egyptian Room. They trace the experience of the soul of Ani from his funeral (represented on the left hand wall) to his judgement in the entrance of the Hall of Truth (represented in the east). That section of the frieze in the east, over the throne for the Master of the Lodge, shows the judgement in which the dead man's soul, represented by his heart, was placed on a balance and weighed against truth and righteousness (Maat), represented by a feather. The balance is held by the jackal-headed god, Anubis. If Ani's heart is heavier than the feather he is condemned. However, if he is found righteous \\"His heart is found righteous coming forth from the balance\\" and he is taken before Osiris in the Hall of Truth. The decoration throughout the rest of the Room is also based on Egyptian sources. For example, over the Junior Warden's Chair (in the centre of the right-hand wall) is a relief reproducing a Stele (or tomb-tablet) of the 20th Dynasty (about 1200 BC) which shows a worshipper making an offering to Osiris as god of the underworld. Around the room stand pillars in classical Egyptian design. Gold-leaf features prominently in the decorations. = Modifications and dates = * 1927 - original construction at 22-24 College Street, Sydney * 1969 - placed in storage * 1977 - re-erected in the Royal Arch Masonic Temple, Petersham  Heritage listing  The Egyptian Room of the Royal Arch Temple at Petersham is unique for its superb decorative frieze which faithfully reproduces illustrations from the text of the Papyrus of Ani, an Egyptian Funerary text dating from about 1450 B.C. The decorations are finely sculpted in low relief plaster and picked out in rich authentic colours, while lotus headed columns support decorative bands of stylised Egyptian motifs and ornaments. The Egyptian Room decorative theme has some precedent in Masonic memorial chambers but the scale and level of elaboration is unique in Australia. The survival of such rich and extensive decoration is rare, not only in Masonic Temples but in large scale interiors generally.

In 2004, Santo Holding GmbH of Andreas and Thomas Str√ºngmann bought DZ Bank's stake of 89.6%. As a result, the S√ºdwestbank left the union of cooperative banks and joined the Bundesverband deutscher Banken and its deposit insurance fund on 1 January 2005.

In 2017, the Austrian bank BAWAG P.S.K. took over the S√ºdwestbank from the previous owners Andreas and Thomas Str√ºngmann.

The collection featured 89 looks. Cameron Traiber opened the runway presentation and Julia Nobis closed it.  Fall 2016  The Valentino Ready-to-Wear Fall 2016 Collection was presented on March 8, 2016 by creative directors Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli. The collection was inspired by ballet and the modern dance movement. The design duo also cited the dance film, They Shoot Horses, Don't They? With references to choreographers Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Diaghilev, and the Ballets Russes the silhouettes featured dresses layered over tutus over sweaters and footless tights; the grand finale featured glitter-sprinkled tulle costumes. As told to Vogue Runway, \\"We always think fashion is cultural, not just about delivering clothes,\\" said Chiuri. \\"We want this show to be about living your moments, feeling each moment uniquely. I really love fashion. This job we do is a good opportunity to describe the time we're in.\\" As told to WWD, \\"Everybody is speaking about 'see and buy,'\\" said Chiuri backstage. \\"We think that to be in the moment is more important. You can see and you can feel as well. You can also buy, but it is not true that fashion is only to buy.\\" Chiuri and Piccioli emphasized the intangible pricelessness of a \\"shared show experience\\" as we know it, creating something that sparks emotion in the buyers, the press, and others who devote their time to the process, which compels them to share what they saw and felt. Like Chanel and Saint Laurent, this collection seemed to react against the instantaneous of social media. According to the show notes, Chiuri and Piccioli aimed to \\"offer a reply to chaos and to the uncertainty of present times, stepping away from virtuality in order to discover the essence of the contemporary in the unrepeatable physicality of an emotion: in experiences that need to be truly lived, in person, and that no digital instrument can fully reinstate.\\" Critics lauded the collection's variety‚Äîa belted gold velvet dress layered over a blush turtleneck; a silver fringed sweater atop a gold- fringed skirt; and bad-girl black swans in tulle, leather and gold-star embroideries. The finale gave way to ingenues in the tea-stained, ruffled tulle dresses and sparkly sweetheart-shaped bodices. Design details included beadwork, feathers, and intricate embroideries. The palette included black, white, nude, camel, grey, and yellow. Fabrications ranged from silk, tulle, georgette, and cashmere to leather, velvet, wool, and fur. The silhouette was focused, coats and capes layered over fluid shapes; slip dresses layered over knits and long dresses accented by ruffles and ruching. The ensembles were accessorized by combat boots, embellished pumps, velvet sandals, quilted handbags, and silver amulets. Instead of a recorded soundtrack, pianist Vanessa Wagner played works by John Cage and Phillip Glass on a baby grand from the middle of the runway. The collection featured 81 looks. Paulina Frankowsa opened the runway presentation and Bara Podzimkova closed it. Sofia Sanchez de Betak, Giancarlo Giammetti, Melanie Thierry, Jeanne Damas, Miroslava Duma, Lisa Marie Fernandez, Karen Elson, Jessica Hart, and Dakota Fanning attended the show.  Spring 2017  The Valentino Ready-to-Wear Spring 2017 Collection was presented on October 2, 2016 by creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli at a salon in the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild; it was his first solo collection after Maria Grazia Chiuri departed for Christian Dior. Piccioli was dually inspired by medieval art, specifically Hieronymus Bosch's triptych,The Garden of Earthly Delights and British fashion designer, Zandra Rhodes. As told to Vogue Runway, \\"He was wonderful,\\" exclaimed Rhodes, who was sitting in the front row today. \\"He and an assistant came to my studio for two days, I showed them everything in my archive, and he asked me what I could do to make prints from the Bosch painting. It's just incredible to see what they did with them.\\" For the most part, hemlines were long. The palette included black, white, pink, chartreuse, yellow, and green. Fabrications ranged from wool, leather, velvet, and fur to lace, georgette, chiffon, and cotton. Featured silhouettes varied from tunics with dresses to bustiers with wide-leg pants.

Fall 2017  The Valentino Ready-to-Wear Fall 2017 Collection was presented on March 5, 2017 by creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli. The designer cited disparate inspirations: Victoriana and the Memphis eighties design movement; the former influenced the silhouette with long, high-waisted and high-neck blouses with romanticism; and the latter influenced the palette and graphic patterns. The majority of the collection featured long dresses and evening gowns. The palette included black, green, red, blue, and pink. Fabrications varied from lace, tulle, and chiffon to leather, velvet, sequins, and wool. The collection was accessorized by coral necklaces, knigh-high boots, military boots, mink sandals, and chain strap handbags. There were 61 looks in the collection. Skylar Tartz opened the show, while Faretta closed it. Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis, Kate Mara, Kate Foley, Laure Heriard Dubreuil, Hannah Bronfman, Virginie Ledoyen, Natalia Vodianova, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Christian Louboutin attended the show.  Spring 2018  The Valentino Ready-to-Wear Spring 2018 Collection was presented on October 1, 2017 by creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli in the courtyard of the Lycee Carnot. The collection was partially inspired by the Apollo moon landing. As told to Vogue Runway, \\"I wanted to get back something of the glamour of the '80s that Mr. Valentino did so well,\\" Piccioli said. During a preview with WWD, Piccioli talked about the moon as a physical place, \\"Where you can find what's lost in the heart, this romantic idea of the moon, the moon as a second chance.\\" Piccioli also cited the Renaissance poem, The Frenzy of Orlando, as an inspiration. \\"I was very impressed by the part when Orlando loses his mind for love, and his best friend has to go to the moon to recover his sanity,\\" Piccioli told British Vogue in a preview at Place Vend√¥me. \\"It's important, because the moon is the place where you can find what is lost in the heart. I like this idea of the moon as a second opportunity.\\" The season's silhouettes included luxe sportswear pieces such as parkas, anoraks, silver sweatshirts, and cargo pants, but there were also trapeze short dresses, apron dresses, and romantic dresses. The palette included blush, pistachio, lavender, yellow, burgandy, fuchsia, white, and black. The collection featured 76 looks. Cosima Fritz opened the runway presentation, while Ratner closed it. Valentino Garavani, Zoey Deutch, Emily Robinson, Alexa Chung, Arizona Muse, Jeanne Damas, Emily Ratajkowski, Carla Bruni, Aymeline Valade, Robin Wright, Hopper Penn, Alber Elbaz, Stefano Tonchi, Marion Cotillard, and Natalia Vodianova attended the show.  Fall 2018  The Valentino Ready-to-Wear Fall 2018 Collection was presented on March 4, 2018 by creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli. There were references to 80's-power-woman with padded shoulders, scalloped edges, and a vibrant palette. As told to WWD, \\"Romanticism,\\" said Piccioli. \\"It's a strength today, if you're able to be assertive but not aggressive.\\" Piccioli said during a preview, \\"As an individual, personal, passionate approach to life. I think that is a real strength today, to be able to be fierce, to be strong and gentle at the same time, not to be aggressive but to be assertive. I started this collection with this idea of romanticism as a strength and not as a fragility.\\" One of the collection's key design elements included oversized flowers, petal-like folds, embroideries, large graphics, and floral intarsia. The silhouettes were enveloping and protective‚Äîgathered hoods, capes, and voluminous shapes. The hemlines varied from midi to ankle-length. Fabrications include crepe, organza, wool, and georgette. The palette included blush, scarlet, cerulean, red, green, and mustard. \\"Sometimes it feels as if women have to renounce their femininity to be stronger. I don't think you need to be authoritarian to be assertive,\\" Piccioli argued in a preview with British Vogue the day before. \\"We used to think of romanticism as something fragile, something close to love, but for me romanticism means an individual approach to life more passionate, more emotional, more human. Today, romanticism is not a weakness, it's a strength. You can be assertive and not be aggressive. To me, being romantic today means being stronger.\\" \\"It's not romantic in a sweet way, it's romantic in a bold way,\\" Piccioli added. \\"Sometimes it's felt as if women had to dress like men to be more powerful. Today is a different moment. People can be exactly how they are. They don't have to renounce the way they are while being assertive. If you take the rules of someone you criticize, it's not good for anyone.\\" Bj√∂rk's \\"Isobel\\" provided the runway soundtrack. The collection featured 67 looks. Adut Akech opened the show and Assa Baradji closed it. Alexia Niedzielski, Amelia Windsor, Ava Phillippe, Dakota Fanning, Dylan Penn, Juergen Teller, Karlie Kloss, Kristin Scott Thomas, Liya Kebede, and Tessa Thompson attended the show.  Spring 2019  The Valentino Ready- to-Wear Spring 2019 Collection was presented on September 30, 2019 by creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli at the Hotel des Invalides. As told to Vogue, ‚ÄúI was thinking of paradises, about artists‚Äô colonies of the past,‚Äù said Piccioli. ‚ÄúThere were reasons why artistic people went off to places like that‚Äîso they could live their identities,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúToday, everyone is talking about escapism. But I don‚Äôt believe in that‚Äîl think everyone should just live their identities in the city, or wherever they are.‚Äù The show notes indicated that Piccioli was inspired by the freedom to be oneself. Inspired by the free-spirited, early 20th-century Maverick artists‚Äô colony in Woodstock, New York, Piccioli told Vogue Italia, ‚ÄúToday you have to be free, to be yourself in your place. You don‚Äôt have to escape‚Ä¶ beautiful means a diversity of expressions of yourself.‚Äù He explained, ‚ÄúI wanted to create pieces that are not ordinary and basic, so with the memory of couture but for contemporary life. Simplicity is not the starting point, but the arrival point. For me, when you solve complexity you arrive at simplicity.‚Äù The collection was also influenced by Marrakech as viewed by Yves Saint Laurent and Henri Matisse and Paul Gauguin‚Äôs time in Tahiti. With a 60‚Äôs bent, the collection opened with a series of black taffeta gowns with balloon sleeves before shifting to feather accessories, dramatic florals, a series of sequined and tulle looks, mini dresses, leather capes, lace pajama sets, and wide-leg suits. The palette included burnt-orange, berry, oxblood, fuschia, aqua, white, and black. Kristen McMenamy opened the presentation of 63 looks, while Adut Akech closed it. Mariacarla Boscono, Vittoria Ceretti, Julie Hoomans, Kaia Gerber, Natalie Ogg, Hannah Motler, Liu Wen, and Elibeidy Dani also walked the show. The presentation, which received a standing ovation was attended by Isabel Goulart, Sofia Sanchez de Betak, Freida Pinto, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Olivia Wilde.  Fall 2019  The Valentino Ready-to-Wear Fall 2019 Collection was presented on March 4, 2019 by Creative Director Pierpaolo Piccioli. This season, he collaborated with Jun Takahashi to create a series of collaged prints with florals and 19th neoclassical sculptures. He was also inspired by The Movement for the Emancipation for Poetry, which employs guerilla tactics to anonymously post pieces of poetry in public places. As told to Vogue, ‚ÄúI feel that people are looking for emotion and dreams‚Äîbut not distant dreams,‚Äù Piccioli said before his ready-to-wear show. ‚ÄúI want to create a community for Valentino. I mean something different from ‚Äòlifestyle,‚Äô which is about owning objects. It‚Äôs about people who share values.‚Äù Piccioli also commissioned Robert Montgomery, Greta Bellamacina, Mustafa The Poet, and Yrsa Daley-Ward to contribute to an anthology of poems, Valentino on Love. The designer continued, ‚ÄúI started this collection thinking about poetry because poetry is similar to couture‚Äîit‚Äôs something that can belong to both the past and to this time. You can find your own poetry through dress.‚Äù The booklets of collected poems were left on each audience member‚Äôs seat. One poem excerpt was displayed on an illuminated boardboard at the runway entrance, it read, ‚ÄúThe people you love become ghosts inside of you and like this you keep them alive.‚Äù Piccioli also selected lines to be printed or embroidered inside the linings of his designs. The designer incorporated statue prints and poetic verses to avoid a classically romantic translation only through florals with more alternate visuals. One mini dress was embroidered with the words ‚Äúkiss me in this light while it still lasts,‚Äù while another featured the words ‚ÄúI woke up and felt the night leaving. Desire looked strange in the light,‚Äù and a black coat read ‚Äúwrap me, free me, see me.‚Äù As told to WWD, ‚ÄúI think of poetry as something that is still beautiful, but it can be contemporary as well,‚Äù Piccioli said during a preview, ‚Äúto keep the values of couture while being contemporary, and making the brand relevant today.‚Äù Silhouettes included tunics, tulle dresses, tailored overcoats, hooded capes, and layered pantsuits. Design details featured couture shapes like sloped shoulders, rounded backs, and floor-length skirts as well as scalloped hems, and floral appliques. The palette ranged from pink, yellow, orange, and scarlet to moss, grey, black, and white. ‚ÄúAfter the couture [show], I wanted to move away from safe territory. A change of silhouette,‚Äù Piccioli explained during a preview with British Vogue, ‚ÄúI still want to keep the couture values in the house, but more daywear, more street, more inclusive.‚Äù Anok Yai opened the runway presentation of 62 looks, while Fran Summers closed it. Adut Akech, Kaia Gerber, Primrose Archer, Elibeidy Dani, Licett Morillo, Mariacarla Boscono, Vittoria Ceretti, Sara Grace Wallerstedt, and Yoon Young Bae also walked the show. La La Anthony, Harley Viera-Newton, Alexa Chung, Katherine Langford, Sofia Sanchez de Betak, Gaia Repossi Greta Bellamacina, Robert Montgomery, Liya Kebede, Sofia Carson, Janelle Mon√°e, Jeanne Damas, and Naomi Campbell were amongst the front row guests.  Spring 2020  The Valentino Ready-to-Wear Spring 2020 Collection was presented on September 29, 2019 by Creative Director Pierpaolo Piccioli. He opened his presentation with a dozen white looks. As told to Vogue, ‚ÄúI wanted to work on something universal, to get back to the essence of shape and volume,‚Äù Piccioli said. ‚ÄúSo I worked on the idea of the white shirt, but treating it with a couture sensibility.‚Äù During a preview with WWD, Piccioli expounded on his creative process.‚ÄúDo you know this technique, called grisaille?‚Äù The 16th-century painting method is when an image is executed entirely in shades of grey, typically to intimate a statue or relief. ‚ÄúIt consists of taking off in order to give life and shape and to go to the essence.‚Äù Bridget Foley of WWD describes Piccioli‚Äôs belief that ‚ÄúCouture is about more than exquisitely wrought dresses that take forever to make and cost a fortune; that it is about a set of values of respect, aspiration and inclusivity, not in terms of purchasing power but in telegraphing messages of beauty and open-mindedness.‚Äù Despite comparisons to Valentino Garavini‚Äôs 1968 All White collection, Piccioli has sought to modernize couture silhouettes by removing stiffness, incorporating more light and volume for fluidity. Silhouettes varied from tunics and shorts to capes and pencil skirts. This season‚Äôs palette also included mauve, peach, plum before shifting to more vibrant neon hues in green, orange, and pink, while jungle and floral prints added another dimension. Design inspirations from Renaissance to Rousseau, gave way to pleats, ruffles, and feathers. Adut Adech opened the runway presentation of 79 looks. Zandra Rhodes, Giancarlo Giammetti, Katherine Langford, Izabel Goulart, Alexa Chung, Moses Sumney, Olivia Palermo, Liya Kebede, and Naomi Campbell were amongst the front row guests.

It is a common infection in countries with poor access to adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene. In humans, hookworm infections are caused by two main species of roundworm belonging to the genera Ancylostoma and Necator. In other animals the main parasites are species of Ancylostoma. Species Infective N. americanus larva The two most common types of hookworm that infect humans are Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Hookworm species that are known to infect domestic cats are Ancylostoma braziliense and Ancylostoma tubaeforme. Wild cats are infected by Ancylostoma pluridentatum. Dogs are commonly infected by Ancylostoma caninum. Characteristics The two common species that infect humans share a similar morphology. A. duodenale worms are pale grey or slightly pink. The head is bent a little in relation to the rest of the body, forming a hook shape ‚Äì hence the name. The hook is at the front end of the body. They have well- developed mouths with two pairs of teeth. Males measure approximately one centimeter by 0.5 millimeter, and females are often longer and stouter. Males also have a prominent copulatory bursa posteriorly. N. americanus is generally smaller than A. duodenale with males usually 5 to 9 mm long and females about 1 cm long. Instead of the two pairs of teeth in A. duodenale, N. americanus has a pair of cutting plates in the buccal capsule. Also the hook is much more defined in Necator americanus. =Life cycle= life cycle The host is infected by the larvae, not by the eggs and the usual route is through the skin. Hookworm larvae need warm, moist soil, above 18 ¬∞C in order to hatch. They will die if exposed to direct sunlight or if they become dried out. Necator larvae can survive at higher temperatures than Ancylostoma larvae. First stage larvae (L1) are non-infective, and once hatched into the deposited feces feed on this, and then feed on soil microorganisms until they moult into second stage larvae (L2). First and second stage larvae are in the rhabditiform stage. After feeding for around seven days or so they will moult into third stage larvae (L3) known as the filariform stage. This is the non- feeding, infective stage. Filariform larvae can survive for up to two weeks, they are extremely motile and will move onto higher ground to improve their chances of finding a host. N. americanus larvae can only infect through penetrating skin, but A. duodenale can also infect orally. A common route of passage for the larvae is the skin of barefoot walkers. Once the larvae have entered the host they travel in the circulatory system to the lungs where they leave the venules and enter the alveoli. They then travel up the trachea where they are coughed up, swallowed and end up in the small intestine. In the small intestine the larvae moult into stage four (L4) the adult worm. It takes from five to nine weeks from penetration to maturity in the intestine.\\"CDC Factsheet: Hookworm\\" Necator americanus can cause a prolonged infection lasting from one to five years with many worms dying in the first year or two. Some worms though have been recorded as living for fifteen years or more. In comparison, Ancyclostoma duodenale worms are short-lived lasting for around six months. However, larvae can remain dormant in tissue stores and be recruited over many years to replace the worms that die. The worms mate inside the host, and the females lay their eggs, to be passed out in the host's feces into the environment to start the cycle again. N. americanus can lay between nine and ten thousand eggs per day, and A. duodenale between twenty-five and thirty thousand per day. Their eggs are indistinguishable. Worms need five to seven weeks to reach maturity and symptoms of infection can therefore appear before eggs are to be found in the feces, making a diagnosis of hookworm infection difficult.

Guidney was born in Norwich in 1779 or 1782. He received five years of part-time education, and worked as an errand boy, before joining the 48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment, initially as a drummer boy, in 1797. He served with them in Gibraltar and then Malta, where he lost his right eye as the result of Ophthalmia. In around 1809 he transferred to the First Royal Veteran Battalion, claiming to have eventually been promoted to \\"Sergeant and Drum Major to the Battalion\\". Several artists painted Guidney; a watercolour portrait by John Church Dempsey is in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery and three in oil (one by William Thomas Roden), and a watercolour, are in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, which also holds a silver plated relief, and the tin from which he sold medicated toffee, \\"good for cough or cold\\". His short biography, Some particulars of the life and adventures of James Guidney, a well known character in Birmingham. Written from his own account of himself., was published anonymously in Birmingham and ran to at least four editions, with revisions.

It was suggested by scholars that this is the Ancient Egyptian Eastern-border city called Tharo from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. The site consists of three sectors, labelled Tel Habuwa I, II and III. Tel Habuwa I dates from the end of the Second Intermediate Period, up to the 26th Dynasty. Tel Habuwa I dates to the beginning of the New Kingdom and also up to the 26th Dynasty. Tel Habuwa III seems to be mainly New Kingdom settlement remains.Elsayed Abdel-AlimÀê Tel HabuaÀê new dicoveries from the Saite Period, in Egyptian Archaeology 56, Spring 2020, p. 10 The 2013 excavations in the site had unearthed the remains of buildings from Thutmoses III and Seti I's reigns and beneath them what seems to be a two stories tall administration buildings and silos from the Hyksos period. Hyksos buildings discovered at the Tel Habuwa dig at News Network Archaeology These buildings associated with the Hyksos were heavily burnt. The silos in Tel Habuwa could store up to 280 tons of grains, which led the scholars to believe that an army unit was sitting in this settlement. Underneath the courtyard in one of the administrative buildings, there were coffins and skeletons found, the skeletons contained clear evidences of violent deaths: they had cutting marks on them and signs of arrows' spearheads that penetrated their bodies and injured them. The bodies were estimated to be the remains of the Hyksos forces who battled against Ahmose I, whose papyrus describing the burning of the city was also found in Tel Habuwa. Two steles were also discovered in Tel Habuwa, they contained the names of a woman who seemingly was a Hyksos royalty, called \\"Tani\\" (dated to live circa 1570 BC), whose title was \\"Sister of the King\\", and of a Hyksos prince called \\"Nahsy\\", who is also mentioned in the Turin King List and in scarabs previously found in Egypt. The head of the excavation had offered that this site was attacked prior to Avaris' downfall to make sure that the Hyksos won't sent messengers from Tel Habuwa to call back-up forces from Canaan (which is quite near) to aid them against Ahmose I's army. In Tel Habuwa I were uncovered parts of a Saite temple complex. The main temple had pylons and was about 61.2 m long and 28.2 m wide. North east of the palace were excavated the remains of a palace and south of it were found the remains of a square building consisting of many casemates, forming a platform. Such buildings are known from others temple complexes.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History Gaines, named for War of 1812 Veteran Edmund T. Gaines, was founded in 1859, soon after the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway laid tracks through Genesee County and established a station at the location. A small village sprang up, with two hotels established in the 1860s, and a grain elevator and numerous stores and businesses constructed by 1875. However, the 1870s marked the peak of the growth in Gaines, and the downtown remained concentrated in a single block. It served as a transportation hub for the local economy, until the last passenger train run in 1958. Description The district includes a total of 16 properties, of which all but three contribute to the historical character of the district. Of the 16, seven are commercial, six are railroad- related, one is residential, one is a post office, and the remaining building is a city hall. The district encompasses a T-shaped area, including structures along both sides of Genesee Avenue between Lord and Walker streets, and six structures between Walker Street and the railroad tracks between Washington and Elm streets. The most visually distinctive structure in the district is the L-plan depot, constructed of uncommon yellow and red brick. Built in 1884 to replace the original depot, it is a single-story depot Victorian Eclectic building with decorative features such as circular openings, stepped corbeling in the gable ends, and large wooden brackets, terminating in stone, supporting the eaves. The remaining buildings include two frame warehouses, lumberyard, and a grain elevator located alongside the railroad tracks. These are functional in design. The buildings along Genesee Avenue are primarily one- and two-story commercial buildings constructed from brick, though a few frame structures are included. The storefronts have 19th century Italianate and Victorian Eclectic features, including cast iron columns, cornices, and recessed entrances.

It was scheduled to be released as the album's sixth and final single, but this plan ended up being cancelled. The music video was released in June 2009. \\"Spaceship II\\" and \\"Spaceship III\\" were released by Alex Wiley in 2013 and Consequence in 2017. Composition The track contains a sample of the recording \\"Distant Lover\\" by Marvin Gaye. The Verge interpreted this sample as using soothing tones to keep \\"Spaceship\\" down to earth, even when it gets aggressive. West's presence on the chorus marks one of the earliest moments of him singing within his career. When West raps about working a job at the Gap formerly in \\"Spaceship\\", the story being told in the verse is actually true. Release The song was originally scheduled to be a GLC track produced by West, until West played it to Plain Pat, whom insisted on him putting it on the album. It was swapped for \\"Good, Bad, Ugly\\" as the position of number six from the original track list to the final. The track was originally supposed to be released as the sixth and final single from The College Dropout, but this plan was cancelled due to West's label moving on to promotion for his second studio album Late Registration (2005) instead of following through with the release of it as a single. Critical reception Paul Cantor of Billboard had praise for the Gaye sample, describing it as being \\"the backdrop for Kanye and his comrades to detail needing day jobs to finance their rapping dreams\\". The opinion was voiced by J-23 of HipHopDX regarding \\"Spaceship\\" that it \\"has to be the best of the additions, if not the best of the album\\".

West also shared it to his blog two days later and revealed that he wasn't satisfied with the video when he directed it four years ago, but West decided that after looking back at it in 2009, he liked it. A music video was shot back in 2005 because the track was originally scheduled to be released as the sixth and final single from the featuring album. The video stars West as a worker in a mall, with GLC playing the role of a co-worker and Consequence playing that of a customer. On June 26, 2020, West posted the video on his website in celebration of the announcement of his clothing brand Yeezy's 10-year collaboration deal with The Gap.

Biography  Rita Rohlfing studied from 1985 to 1991 at the Braunschweig University of Art. In 1992 she was appointed \\"Master student\\" (Meistersch√ºler) by Bernd Minnich and Roland D√∂rfler. Also in 1992 she received the \\"Dragoco Scholarship for Young Artists\\" at the Rudolf-Jahns- Haus in Holzminden and was honoured with an exhibition of her Panel paintings. In 1994 she received a scholarship for the United States from the German Academic Exchange Service and studied there at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. In 2002 she was a stipendiary of the \\"Stiftung K√ºnstlerdorf Sch√∂ppingen\\" and in 2004 she was granted a junior scholarship by the Kunststiftung NRW. Rita Rohlfing is a member of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund and of the \\"Westdeutscher K√ºnstlerbund\\". She lives and works in Cologne. In 2018 Rita Rohlfing was awarded the , which was granted for the tenth time this year.  Artistic work  Rohlfing's works of art are located at the border between sculpture and painting. In addition to panel paintings, she creates object-like wall and floor elements and designs spatial installations: \\"If her works with their vital interest in paint and its effects also have strong roots in the field of color painting, they, with their emphasis on material and spatial effects, always present themselves as three-dimensional objects and as such have a relation to sculpture. In a large-scale format they even expand into veritable environments.\\" (In German \\"Wenn auch ihre Arbeiten mit ihrem vitalen Interesse an Farbe und Farbwirkung eine starke Verankerung im Bereich der Farbmalerei besitzen, so pr√§sentieren sie sich mit ihrer Betonung von Material und Raumwirkung doch immer auch als dreidimensionale Objekte und besitzen als solche einen skulpturalen Bezug; im Gro√üformat weiten sie sich sogar zu veritablen Rauminstallationen.\\") = Panel paintings = Rohlfing's panel paintings are usually very large, irregularly shaped and monochrome, painted in bright red tones that radiate intensively into the surrounding space. Although the shaped canvases hangs on the wall like pictures, their form creates the impression of three-dimensionality. This becomes clear in her work \\"R.o.T.\\" If one is standing directly in front of the work, it appears like a usual rectangular mural. But if the viewer moves and changes his point of view, he recognizes that the canvas is thicker at the top than at the bottom and the character of the rectangle becomes questionable. It seems as if the picture surface is curving towards the front into the room. Rohlfing's panel paintings are thus neither pure wall paintings nor pure sculptures, but rather they are expressions of the artist's cross-genre working method.

She often combines various elements such as panel paintings, photographs and spatial installations into a Gesamtkunstwerk. Every single element of the installation is carefully planned to achieve the desired effect for the viewer. The use of color in her objects is an integral part of her productions, mostly she uses different shades of Red tones that radiate intensively into the surrounding space. In her individual objects, the colored elements are often hidden under frosted acrylglas panels. They get a diffuse nuance and look \\"nebelig\\" (in English \\"foggy\\"). The observer cannot see which elements are responsible for the color effect. With her installations, Rita Rohlfing transforms existing spaces to such an extent that a kind of \\"second space\\" is created that superimposes the existing space, a \\"virtual space\\" so to speak. Considering the names of their exhibitions/installations such as \\"Lufft√∂ne\\" (in English \\"Air Tones\\"), \\"Drahtseilakt\\" (in English \\"Balance Act\\"), \\"Scheinbar\\" (in English \\"Seemingly\\"), \\"Transparenzen\\" (in English \\"Transparence\\") and \\"Ambivalenz\\" (in English \\"Ambivalence\\"), many areas fascinating Rohlfing are hereby described. The essential aspect is always that nothing is certain or irrevocably fixed. Rooms change as one walks through them; depending on the point of view, the ovserver sees other parts of the installation and becomes part of the installation while walking through it. The installation effects the whole heart and soul. People locate themselves in a spatial structure among other things through the angles that indicate to them where the walls are, what limitations the space has, etc. Rita Rohlhfing uses this basic knowledge to design her spatial installations in such a way that the visitor experiences irritations, perspectives are altered, and the rooms appear larger, higher, narrower, or even disappear altogether, using both acute and blunt angles. The spatial installations of Rita Rohlfing developed from room-related installations to installations that not only determine the entire space, but also change its architecture for a limited period of time, up to presentations that make use of a complete museum in all its possibilities: \\"For Rita Rohlfing, rooms are no longer just mirror surfaces and virtual extensions of her works; the occupation of real space combined with the creation of color spaces has become part of her artistic concept.\\" (In German \\"R√§ume sind f√ºr Rita Rohlfing nicht mehr nur Spiegelfl√§che und virtuelle Erweiterungen ihrer Arbeiten, die Besetzung des Realraums verbunden mit der Erzeugung von Farbr√§umen ist Teil ihres k√ºnstlerischen Konzeptes geworden.\\")  Installation \\"Luftt√∂ne\\" (\\"Air Tones\\", 1999)  Rohlfing's work in Kunstmuseum M√ºlheim an der Ruhr covered the entire 16 metre deep and 12 metre wide room. As soon as the visitor entered the room, he saw five frosted acrylic glass panes hanging in front of him, floating one meter above the floor, three meters long, appearing opaque. At a distance of 3 metres, another row of acrylic glass panes, also suspended from the ceiling, followed at the same distance as the first row. Walking through the room, depending on the observer's point of view, there were prospects of this second row. A further 3 meters away was another row of aluminium panels, which were suspended from the ceiling and monochrome painted in various \\"states of red\\": Pure Vermilion, Orange and pink radiated into the surrounding environment: \\"The painted alumium plates seem to float in the room, and are blurred into diffuse 'air tones' through reflections in the plexiglas. What arises is a space sculpture, which reconstitutes itself constantly as the observer moves through the various points, until the color red becomes palpable as a red fog, like a veil, like an air tone.\\" (In German \\"Die bemalten Aluminiumplatten scheinen im Raum zu schweben und werden durch die Spiegelung in den Plexiglasscheiben zu diffusen Lichtt√∂nen 'verschwommen'. Es entwickelt sich eine Gesamtskulptur, durch die der Betrachter sich bewegt und die sich im Abschreiten der unterschiedlichen Raumwerte immer wieder nu konstituiert und im Raum gleichsam die Farbe Rot wie einen roten Nebel, wie einen Schleier, eben wie einen Luftton erfahrbar macht.\\") Through the filter of the opaque, milky-looking glass panes, the color is fanfolded into a kind of spatial color, it loses its material quality and becomes ‚Äì very appropriately the artist named the installation with this title ‚Äì an \\"air tone\\" that increases the vibration intensity in the entire room.

It is an exhibition space that is very long and high. The room is spanned by an iron bridge to which stairs lead on both sides. Rita Rohlfing realized a walkable work of art: she installed 18 aluminum panels along the two side walls, 3 meters high and 1.50 meters wide, which emphasize the longitudinal axis of the room. A further 14 three-metre-high steel girders were aligned in parallel at regular intervals. Between these, she fastened long steel cables that were anchored in the floor. As a result of these interventions, the space suddenly appears constricted, the viewer locked up in the eight narrow passages provided ‚Äì they determine the direction of the steps. Other visitors of the installation can be seen, but a closer contact seems impossible, because one cannot leave the paths: \\"The faculties of the walkers within this installation ‚Äì visual perception, overall psychic state ‚Äì are activated by the combination of linear guideposts and opacities, stimulating subjective associations.\\" (in German \\"Die Sinne des Durchschreitenden, sowohl seine optische Wahrnehmung als auch ihre Beeinflussung durch sein psychisches Gesamtempfinden, werden durch diese linearen Lenkungen oder Verunkl√§rungen des Blicks aktiviert und zu subjektiven Assoziationen gereizt.\\")  Installation \\"Rotlichtbezirk\\" (\\"Red Light District\\", 2002)  With her installation \\"Rotlichtbezirk\\" Rita Rohlfing went one step further. Not only did she use the available space for her installation, but through her work she changed the entire architectural ensemble of the exhibition space for a limited time. The \\"Alte Rotation\\" is a former industrially used room with two floors and a staircase in the middle of the room that connects the two. Rohlfing designed 14,5-meter long and 4,4-meter high containers for this area, which completely concealed the stairs and the basement floor. At the edges they were framed with aluminium panels and the upper side was covered with PVC film, which glowed reddish from the depth. On the one hand, the room was given a simple sobriety by the rectangular shape of the floor objects and the metallic appearance of the aluminium panels. At the same time, the reddish shimmer of the color radiation into the room gave it an \\"emotionally heightened color colorfulness\\". (In German \\"emotional gesteigerte Farbigkeit\\".) While the visitor walks around the installation, he sees the color change in different shades of red and yet cannot recognize where the light actually comes from. For the viewer of the installation, it looks as if the containers have a mysterious inner life, a kind of infinite depth in which mystery happens.  Installation \\"Das Virtuelle im Konkreten\\" (\\"The Virtual in the Concrete\\", 2015)  With the Clemens Sels Museum Rita Rohlfing for the first time had a complete museum at her disposal for her orchestration. her in her conception for the exhibition, she dealt intensively with the \\"bulky architecture\\" (in German \\"sperrigen Architektur\\") the building. It was realized in 1975 by Harald Deilmann in the style of postmodern architecture. The massive concrete elements construct a space that radiates stability and clarity. In contrast, the artist Rita Rohlfing is particularly interested in the diffuse and mysterious nature of spaces, in the instability in experiencing spatiality\\" (in German \\"Verunsicherung im Raumerlebnis\\") caused by light, colors and spatial irritations. It was therefore a particular challenge for her to make these spatial experiences possible despite the rigid architecture. Eleven of the total of 19 works of art were created especially for the museum. Objects, installations, photographs and a projection were used: \\"The artist, who has been living in Cologne for a long time, makes the museum dance with her very different spatial situations.\\" (in German \\"Die seit langem in K√∂ln beheimatete K√ºnstlerin bringt das Museum mit seinen ganz unterschiedlichen Raumsituationen zum Tanzen.\\") For the foyer with the staircase consisting of \\"concrete cubic blocks\\" ( in German \\"blockhaften kubischen Betonelementen\\") Rohlfing designed a 12 x 6.50-meter black and white projection, \\"The Virtual in the Concrete\\". It was projected onto the concrete body of the staircase and shows a photograph from New York, a tall building with fire ladders, photographed by Rohlfing in extreme view from below. This overlay of the massive staircase with the small structures and lines of the projection counteracts the heaviness of the staircase: \\"By means of this specific intervention, Rita Rohlfing has seemingly ‚Äì that is, virtually ‚Äì contrived a visual interplay of lightweight and heavy, near and far, large and small, an effect that unfolds between reality and projection, between surrounding space and artwork.\\" (In German \\"Durch diesen gezielten Eingriff hebt Rita Rohlfing das Konstruktive der realen Architektur scheinbar ‚Äì also rein virtuell ‚Äì auf und l√§sst ein visuelles Wechselspiel von Leichtigkeit und Schwere, N√§he und Ferne, Gro√ü und Klein entstehen, das sich wirkungsvoll zwischen Realit√§t und Projektion, zwischen Umraum und Kunstwerk entfaltet.\\") The \\"untitled spaces\\" attached to the wall also have an effect, objects made of matted acrylic glass cases inside of which there are colored form elements which are not exactly recognizable and which radiate into the room. Here, too, the position of the observer determines which colors can be perceived: \\"What appears almost colorless from a fixed position can be transformed into a surprising colour experience from another perspective\\". (In German \\"Was von einer fixierten Position aus fast farblos erscheint, kann sich aus anderer Perspektive in ein √ºberraschendes Farberlebnis verwandeln.\\") Rohlfing realized the installation \\"Anscheinend\\" (in English \\"Apparently\\") in the garden hall of the museum. Matted acrylic glass walls, more than four meters high and two meters wide, radiated a red hue that could be perceived from inside and outside.A window thus became an opening between the inside and outside, which could be viewed from both sides and whose coloring fluctuated in different shades of red depending on the incoming daylight. Another element of the exhibition were the large photographs entitled \\"Scheinbar\\" (in English \\"Seemingly\\"), which had a height of 2 meters and a width of 1.25 meters. They show an obviously enlarged image of an indefinable something. Nothing in this exhibition is clear, sharply defined, precisely delimited. On the contrary, borders between inside and outside become almost permeable membranes as in the installation in the garden hall; the wall objects shine in the most varied colors, but the visitor cannot be sure where the light comes from, since the matte acrylglas makes it impossible for him to see through them; the photographed objects do not reveal themselves to him in the photographs, no matter how close he looks at them: Everything in this exhibition breathes mystery and enigma and thus stimulates reflection on one's own perception: \\"In her works, she reflects the fact that we live in a present age that is enormously complex and, in its many aspects, has become incomprehensible.\\" (In German \\"In ihren Arbeiten reflektiert sich die Tatsache, dass wir in einer Gegenwart leben, die ungeheuer komplex und in vielen ihrer Aspekte unverst√§ndlich geworden ist.\\") Gesamtkunstwerk Das Virtuelle im Konkreten Rita Rohlfing Anscheinend.jpgPart of the Spatial installation Title \\"Anscheinend\\", 2015, Clemens Sels Museum Neuss, Mixed Media 177 x 67 x 8,5 inches Gesamtkunstwerk Das Virtuelle im Konkreten RitaRohlfing projection 2015.jpgPart of the Spatial installation Projection \\"The Virtual in the Concrete\\", 2015 394 x 256 inches Gesamtkunstwerk Das Virtuelle im Konkreten Rita Rohlfing Scheinbar.jpgPart of the Spatial installation, Photographs \\"Scheinbar\\", 2015 Lamda Print mounted behind Acrylic glass af Aluminium-Dibond each 78,5 x 49 √ó 1 inches  Other installations  * 2009: Fully Booked ‚Äì Hotel Beethoven, Installation in public space, Moving Locations registered association, Bonn, Germany * 2010: Mapping the City, Installation in public space, Vorgebirgspark Sculpture, Cologne, Germany * 2013: Heidenheim (\\"reflction\\" in the original instead of \\"reflection\\".

Portrayed by Fiona Dourif, she is a zealous cult leader whose followers sacrifice themselves during a night of anarchy, believing that the act will benefit them and others. Throughout the show's first season, a man named Miguel Guerrero pursues Tavis's bus while attempting to save his sister from the group. Producers initially sought a male actor for the role, but eventually allowed women to audition as well. Dourif was cast immediately after she read for the part. Tavis has received positive reviews from television critics. Overview As with other works in its franchise, The Purge takes place during an annual night when crime in America is legalized for 12 hours. The series introduces a cult led by Good Leader Tavis, who has convinced her followers to allow themselves to be killed on Purge Night, claiming that their sacrifice will save others and be rewarded by God in the afterlife. Throughout the evening, some of her students begin to question their decision, creating occasional conflicts. Tavis's bus is pursued by former Marine Miguel Guerrero, who seeks to remove his sister Penelope from the cult. Casting and creation While developing the TV series, Purge creator James DeMonaco envisioned a nontraditional set of characters whose intention was sacrifice, rather than survival. He pictured the leader as a charismatic man whose followers \\"offer themselves up as martyrs to people who want to Purge.\\" Around this point in the production, Fiona Dourif had gained popularity for her performances in horror-based projects; Bloody Disgusting labeled the actress a \\"genre fan-favorite\\". Producers eventually reconsidered their stance on the character's gender and invited Dourif to audition. She won the part after one reading. In May 2018, Deadline Hollywood announced that Dourif would join the series as a \\"much-adored, charismatic cult leader\\" who would command a number of \\"fawning followers.\\" Dourif's casting drew quick recognition from Entertainment Weekly, Yahoo!, and other media outlets, with iHorror praising her \\"knockout talent as an actress.\\" Though listed as a recurring player, Tavis was featured prominently in promotional material, including the series' first trailer, and on USA Network's website. Having viewed the first two Purge films, Dourif came to see the franchise as a \\"fun, scary ride [that] makes you think about these bigger issues\\". When introduced, Tavis is presented as a zealous and unwavering motivator. \\"Her charisma just takes everybody over,\\" said Dourif, who was primarily drawn to the part because of the influence that the character wields. \\"It just became this experiment of, what it would be like to be so fully convinced of something, and so passionate and righteous that I can command attention like she does. It was just so fun,\\" she said. To prepare for the role, Dourif watched \\"hours of preaching, and inspirational videos,\\" while basing the character in part on her real-life mother, a former psychic. To further immerse herself in the part, she chose not to view Tavis as a villainess. \\"I play her as someone who believes in the righteousness of what she's doing. There may be some doubt sometimes, like there is with everything that people do. She's like a painter, who is devoted to her art. She's gonna make the world a better place,\\" she said. Dourif noted that more information on Tavis would be revealed throughout the series, and stated that playing the character \\"was maybe the most fun I've had on a job, ever.\\" Reception In a review of the opening episodes, Spencer Barrett of TV Source lauded the series, but found the arc of lead character Miguel underwhelming. \\"More interesting is the cult Penelope has joined thanks to a slyly sinister performance by Dourif. While it seems Tavis has the best intentions for her cult 'children,' Dourif's performance lets you know there is more to her character than meets the eye,\\" he said. Mike Walkusky of DirecTV.com labeled Dourif a \\"majestic\\" actress, and recognized her as \\"so good\\" in the role. Nick Venable of CinemaBlend noted Dourif's \\"undying smile, which becomes more haunting as the show goes on.\\" Den of Geeks Ronald Hogan evaluated Tavis in a review of episode three. \\"She's making the Purge work for her. It doesn't have to be all about killing and mayhem. For some, it's protecting others, being a hero. For others, it's all about power, being in charge, controlling others\\", he said. He also declared, \\"Fiona Dourif is absolutely brilliant.\\" Jack O'Keefe wrote an editorial for Bustle.com on Tavis and her cult, noting that the story captured his interest and left him with \\"a great deal of questions.\\" The editors of Bloody Disgusting featured an image of Tavis in their annual fall preview article, stating, \\"It will be interesting to see how the action-horror franchise translates to a slower episodic format, but with recurring stars like Fiona Dourif as a cult leader and William Baldwin, you can bet we‚Äôre very curious.\\" References The Purge 2018 American television series debuts USA Network original programming Television characters introduced in 2018 Fictional cult leaders ","title":"Good Leader Tavis"},{"id":"58516007","text":"Alexandru Corban (born 29 January 1998) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Aerostar BacƒÉu References External links 1998 births Living people People from ComƒÉne»ôti Romanian footballers Association football midfielders Liga I players FC Boto»ôani players Liga II players CS »òtiin»õa Miroslava players CS Aerostar BacƒÉu players ","title":"Alexandru Corban"},{"id":"58516008","text":"Otto Kraushaar (31 May 1812 - 23 November 1866) was a German musician, writer and composer.

The technique was developed from the observations of pale wisps seen moving on radar during the Second World War. These were termed as \\"angels\\", \\"ghosts\\", or \\"phantoms\\" in Britain and were later identified as being caused by migrating birds. Over time, the technology has been vastly improved with Doppler weather radars that allow the detection of birds, bats, as well as insects with resolution and sensitivity that is sufficient to quantify the speed of flaps that can sometimes aid in the identification of species. History  According to David Lack, the earliest recorded use of radar in detecting birds came in 1940. The movements of gulls, herons and lapwings that caused some of the detentions was visually confirmed. It was however only in the 1950s through the work of Ernst Sutter at Zurich airport that more elusive \\"angels\\" were confirmed to be caused by small passerines. David Lack was one of the pioneers of radar ornithology in England.  Applications  Early radar ornithology mainly focused, due to limitations of the equipment, on the seasonality, timing, intensity, and direction of flocks of birds in migration. Modern weather radars can detect the wing area of the flying, the speed of flight, the frequency of wing beat, the direction, distance and altitude. The sensitivity and modern analytical techniques now allows detection of flying insects as well. Radar has been used to study seasonal variations in starling roosting behaviour. It has also been used to identify risks to aircraft operations at airports. The technique has been in conservation applications such as being used to assess the risk to birds by proposed wind energy installations, to quantify the number of birds at roost or nesting sites.

The discharge was caused by the over-tightening of a coupling at a 3/8-inch cooling line at the top of a 14-inch mainline pump. * On March 15, 2005, the Kinder Morgan Tejas pipeline at Nacogdoches, Texas, had a ‚Äúsignificant event‚Äù due to incorrect operation.‚ÄúTexas Significant Incidents Listing,‚Äù 2003-2014, PHMSA Pipeline Safety Stakeholder Communication, U.S. DOT, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_TX_flt_sig.html?nocache=8751, accessed June 17, 2014. * On March 16, a crew installing a communications cable nicked a gas distribution pipeline in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. The crew then notified the local One Call center, but failed to alert first responders. two hours after the nick, gas exploded in a house, burning two teenagers there. * On April 1, a Kinder Morgan Energy Partners petroleum products pipeline leaked gasoline near Truckee, California. Gasoline spread into Summit Creek, then, into Donner Lake. About 300 gallons spilled. The cause of the leakage was stress corrosion cracking.U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration Corrective Order to Richard D.

The pipeline failed from external corrosion. * On May 13, an underground natural gas pipeline exploded near Marshall, Texas, sending a giant fireball into the sky and hurling a section of pipe onto the grounds of a nearby electric power generating plant. Two people were hurt. The OPS concluded that stress corrosion cracking was the culprit. * On May 13, the 30-inch Seaway Pipeline, operated by TEPPCO at the time, failed in Bryan County, Oklahoma, spilling approximately 898 barrels of crude oil. Oil reached Eastman Creek. The discharge was caused by a 6-inch longitudinal seam split on the pipeline that resulted from a stress crack that may have been induced by conditions occurring during rail transport of the pipe, and enlarged by pressure-cycle-induced stresses over years of operation of the pipeline. * On May 23, a Magellan Pipeline petroleum products pipeline broke near Kansas City, Kansas, spilling gasoline into the nearby Missouri River. About 2,936 barrels of gasoline were spilled, with about 2,400 barrels being lost. * On May 28, a Kinder Morgan Energy Partners pipeline ruptured in El Paso, Texas, releasing gasoline. * On August 11, a bulldozer hit a crude oil pipeline north of Lufkin, Texas. The escaping crude ignited, injuring the bulldozer operator. About 18,500 gallons of crude oil were lost. * On August 18, a leak was detected in an insulating flange along the BP Amoco Whiting to River Rouge pipeline at a monitoring well in Granger, Indiana. Initially, the bolts and nuts were replaced around the flange to mitigate any leaks; on August 25, when supply concerns diminished, the insulating flange was cut out and replaced with a straight section of pipe. Approximately 21 gallons of gasoline were removed from the ground, with no injuries or fatalities. Metallurgical analysis revealed that the fiber ring joint gasket had evidence of a prior leak. * On August 29 Hurricane Katrina caused a protective levee to fail near Nairn, Louisiana in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, causing a Shell 20-inch pipeline to rupture. About 13,400 gallons were spilled, with about 10,500 gallons of this spill reaching the shoreline, and coastal marshes. * In August, Hurricane Katrina damaged numerous offshore pipelines, in Gulf of Mexico region. * On September 18, a pipeline pumping station employee was killed in Monroe, Ohio, when leaking propane was ignited by an arcing pump, causing an explosion.

Judge briefly drew national attention during the 2018 Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, when professor Christine Blasey Ford alleged that Judge was present and laughing as Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were high school students over 30 years previously. Judge said that he had no memory of the incident. Early life and education Judge was born in 1964. His father, Joseph Judge, graduated from Catholic University of America in 1950 and subsequently became a journalist for Life and then for National Geographic. Judge is the grandson of Joe Judge, a Major League Baseball player for the Washington Senators for the period 1915‚Äì1932; he later wrote a book about his grandfather. Judge grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland. He describes his parents as often inattentive and recounts that he observed his father's heavy drinking of alcohol. Judge started drinking at 14. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, graduating in 1983. Judge was friends with classmate Brett Kavanaugh; both were in the same class there with Maryland State Senate member Richard Madaleno. The period became the subject of scrutiny in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme Court, and allegations were made that in 1982 Judge witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford, then a student from a local girls' school. Judge received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Catholic University of America (CUA) in 1990.  Career  Judge was a freelance writer in 1989 in the Washington, D.C. area. By 1990 he had become a contributor to The Progressive, In These Times, and Sojourners. Judge briefly taught at Georgetown University but left in the 1990s. In 1997 Judge wrote Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk, a memoir about his youthful alcoholism. The New York Times review called it a \\"naive and earnest\\" book. Judge resided in Potomac, Maryland in 1998. Judge was a contributing writer to the New York Press, an alternative weekly, in 1999. Judge published If It Ain't Got That Swing: The Rebirth of Grown-Up Culture in 2000. The book chronicled the author's transition from support of liberalism towards right-wing politics. Judge writes that he was influenced by the writings of Christopher Lasch, especially his work The Culture of Narcissism. By February 2001, Judge's book If It Ain't Got That Swing had become a bestseller in the United States; The book received largely negative reviews. Judge's book Damn Senators, about his Major League Baseball player grandfather Joe Judge, was published in 2003 to favorable reviews. The Weekly Standard wrote of the author's description of 1924: \\"Mark Gauvreau Judge, has beautifully captured the excitement and intensity of that season.\\" On Weekend Edition, journalist Michael Kranish highlighted Judge's book Damn Senators among his favorite summer reading picks in 2004. The Wall Street Journal wrote that Judge \\"so nicely captured\\" the \\"glory of Washington baseball\\" in Damn Senators. In God and Man at Georgetown Prep (2005,) Judge wrote that the faculty at Georgetown Prep contained a multitude of homosexual priests, and heavy drinking and wild parties were rampant among the students. Biographer Jerry Oppenheimer wrote in his 2015 book RFK Jr.: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Dark Side of the Dream, that Judge's book \\"caused quite a storm, especially among the alumni and administration going back decades, because Judge, a conservative Catholic, had alleged that 'alcoholism was rampant' among the 'left-wing Jesuits' and claimed that the school had been a hotbed of 'rampant homosexuality.' Half of the faculty, he asserted, 'was gay.'\\" Publishers Weekly called the book \\"a humorous, edgy look at his experiences in three prestigious U.S. Catholic schools.\\" National Catholic Register found Judge's writing to be too vague, commenting, \\"There are too many theories and too little space.\\" The Wichita Eagle recommended a piece by Judge for Christianity Today in 2006, commenting it evidenced the ability of religious believers to appreciate the good that musical culture can bring to society. Judge's book, A Tremor of Bliss: Sex, Catholicism, and Rock 'n' Roll, was published in 2010. First Things wrote, \\"An insightful history of the rise of contraception in the last century provides the most valuable material in A Tremor of Bliss.\\" The publication recommended Judge's work, concluding, \\"A Tremor of Bliss is a book well worth reading from an author unafraid of showing some 'attitude.'\\" Jeremy Lott of The Washington Times reviewed the book, concluding, \\"Judge proposes a Catholic sexual counterrevolution, though he doesn't want to call it that. What he clearly does want is U.S. Catholic education to play a vital role in countering the current almost-anything-goes culture.\\" In addition to writing books, Judge has contributed to The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Weekly Standard, and First Things. Regarding LGBT people, Judge wrote in The Daily Caller, \\"We simply are not allowed to talk about certain things at the risk of our jobs and reputations. One is human anatomy, another is the problem of promiscuity in the gay community.\\" Judge wrote a piece titled \\"Hard Case Crime: the Beauty of Male Passion\\" on Splice Today lamenting that \\"today‚Äôs social justice warriors don‚Äôt like a sexy damsel in distress\\". Judge elaborated that \\"Of course ... no means no and yes means yes. But there‚Äôs also that ambiguous middle ground, where the woman seems interested and indicates, whether verbally or not, that the man needs to prove himself to her. And if that man is any kind of man, he‚Äôll allow himself to feel the awesome power, the wonderful beauty, of uncontrollable male passion.\\"  Brett Kavanaugh Supreme court nomination  In 2018, Judge was implicated in an alleged sexual assault that surfaced after his high school classmate Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States. On September 27, Christine Blasey Ford testified under oath before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary that when all three were in high school at a party in 1982, Judge and Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom where Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes against her will while Judge watched and laughed. Judge told The New Yorker that he had \\"no recollection\\" of the alleged incident. In a follow-up interview with The Weekly Standard, Judge called the allegations \\"just absolutely nuts. I never saw Brett act that way.\\" Asked if there was \\"rough-housing\\" with female peers that the Weekly Standard interviewer suggested \\"might have been interpreted differently by parties involved\\", Judge said he only recollected it taking place among the male students of the all-boys school: \\"I don't remember any of that stuff going on with girls.\\" He subsequently sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying, \\"I have no memory of this alleged incident.\\" Judge also stated he did not wish to speak publicly about the incident. Following the announcement of the allegations, Judge temporarily moved to a beach house in Bethany Beach, Delaware under recommendation of his lawyer. He was found a week later by a Washington Post reporter outside the home, along with his car, which was filled with his belongings. Multiple U.S. senators acquired copies of Judge's books about his time with Kavanaugh at Georgetown Preparatory School, to prepare for questioning Kavanaugh and Ford before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. In a subsequent New Yorker article, Elizabeth Rasor, who was once in a relationship with Judge for three years, stated that \\"Mark told me a very different story.\\" She said he told her of taking turns having sex with drunk women at Georgetown Prep. Another woman also disputed Judge's account of the social scene at the time, sending a letter to Ford's lawyers saying that she had witnessed boys at parties, that included Georgetown Prep students, engaging in sexual misconduct. On September 28, 2018, Senator Richard Blumenthal made a motion before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary to subpoena Judge to testify about Kavanaugh. Blumenthal said before calling his motion, \\"He has never been questioned by any member of our committee. He has never submitted a detailed account of what he knows and so I move ... that we subpoena Mark Judge.\\" Blumenthal noted, \\"The third person in the room was Mark Judge, who was never questioned by the FBI or interviewed by the committee.\\" Republicans defeated the motion for a subpoena on a party-line vote. US Congressman Ted Lieu of the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and Congressman Elijah Cummings of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform stated their intentions to subpoena Judge and call him for testimony before the US Congress, after the 2018 US midterm elections. After Republican US Senator Jeff Flake called for an FBI investigation, Judge released a statement that he would cooperate with all law enforcement authorities regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh. After a request from Flake, followed by a request from the US Senate Judiciary Committee, President Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations.

It is common in people with spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS) or spina bifida. The gastrointestinal tract has a complex control that relies on coordinated interaction between muscular contractions and neuronal impulses. Faecal incontinence or constipation occurs when there is a problem with the normal bowel functioning; this could be for a variety of reasons. The normal defecation pathway involves contractions of the colon in order to help mix the contents, absorb water and propel the contents along the intestine. This results in the faeces moving from the colon to the rectum. The presence of stool in the rectum causes a reflexive relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, so the contents of the rectum can move in to the anal canal. This causes the conscious feeling of the need to defecate. At a suitable time our brain can send signals causing the external anal sphincter and puborectalis muscles to relax as these are under voluntary control and this allows defecation to take place. Spinal cord injury and other neurological problems mostly affect the lower GI tract leading to symptoms of incontinence or constipation. However, the upper GI tract may also be affected and patients with neurogenic bowel often present with multiple symptoms. Research shows there is a high prevalence of upper abdominal complaints, for example a study showed that approximately 22% of SCI patients reported feeling bloated and about 31% of SCI patients‚Äô experienced abdominal distension.  Signs and symptoms  Neurogenic bowel dysfunction can have an impact on a person's life as it often leads to difficulties with self-esteem, personal relationships, social life and can also reduce a person's independence. There is also evidence from studies showing that faecal incontinence can increase the risk of depression and anxiety.  Causes  Different neurological disorders affect the gastrointestinal tract in different ways: = Spinal cord injury = Bowel dysfunction caused by a spinal cord injury will vary greatly depending on the severity and level of the spinal cord lesion. In complete spinal cord injury both sensory and motor functions are completely lost below the level of the lesion so there is a loss of voluntary control and loss of sensation of the need to defecate. An incomplete spinal cord injury is one where there may still be some sensation or motor function below the level of the lesion. Colorectal dysfunction due to spinal cord injury can be classified in to two types: an upper motor neuron lesion or lower motor neuron lesion. Problems with the upper motor neuron in a neurogenic bowel results in a hypertonic and spastic bowel because the defecation reflex centre, which causes the involuntary contraction of muscles of the rectum and anus, remains intact. However, the nerve damage results in disruption to the nerve signals and therefore there is an inability to relax the anal sphincters and defecate, often leading to constipation. An upper motor neuron lesion is one that is above the conus medullaris of the spinal cord and therefore above the vertebral level T12. On the other hand, a lower motor neuron lesion can cause areflexia and a flaccid external anal sphincter so most commonly leading to incontinence. Lower motor neuron lesions are damage to nerves that are at the level of or below the conus medullaris and below vertebral level T12. However, both upper and lower motor neuron disorders can lead to constipation and/ or incontinence. = Spina bifida = Patients with Spina Bifida have a neural tube that has failed to completely form. This is most commonly in the lower back area in the region of the conus medullaris or cauda equina. It, therefore, affects the bowel similarly to a spinal cord injury affecting the lower motor neuron resulting in a flaccid unreactive rectal wall and means the anal sphincter doesn't contract and close therefore leading to stool leakage. Most patients with spina bifida also have hydrocephalus this can result in intellectual deficits so can contribute to faecal incontinence. = Multiple sclerosis = There are a variety of symptoms associated with this condition that are all caused by a loss of myelin, the insulating layer surrounding the neurones. This means the nerve signals are interrupted and slower which will then cause muscle contractions to be fewer and irregular resulting in an increased colon transit time. The faeces being in the colon for a longer time will mean that more water is absorbed leading to harder stools and therefore increasing the symptoms of constipation. This neurological problem can also lead to reduced sensation of rectal filling and weakness of the anal sphincter because of weak muscular contraction so can cause stool leakage. In patients with multiple sclerosis constipation and faecal incontinence often coexist and they can be acute, chronic or intermittent due to the fluctuating pattern of MS. = Brain lesion = Damage to the defecation centre within the medulla oblongata of the brain can lead to bowel dysfunction. A stroke or acquired brain injury may lead to damage to this centre in the brain. Damage to the defecation centre can lead to a loss of coordination between rectal and anal contractions and also a loss of awareness of the need to defecate. = Parkinson's disease = This condition differs as it affects both the extrinsic and enteric nervous systems due to the decreased dopamine levels in both. This results in less smooth muscle contraction of the colon, increasing the colon transit time. The reduced dopamine levels also causes dystonia of the striated muscles of the pelvic floor and external anal sphincter. This explains how Parkinson's disease can lead to constipation. = Diabetes mellitus = Twenty percent of people with diabetes mellitus experience faecal incontinence due to irreversible autonomic neuropathy. This is due to the high blood glucose levels over time damaging the nerves, which can lead to impaired rectal sensation. Mechanism There are different types of neurons involved in innervating the lower GI tract these include: the enteric nervous system; located within the wall of the gut, and the extrinsic nervous system; comprising sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. The enteric nervous system directly controls the gut motility, whereas, the extrinsic nerve pathways influence gut contractility indirectly through modifying this enteric innervation. In almost all cases of neurogenic bowel dysfunction it is the extrinsic nervous supply affected and the enteric nervous supply remains intact. The only exception being Parkinson's disease, as this can affect both the enteric and extrinsic innervation. Defecation involves conscious and subconscious processes, when the extrinsic nervous system is damaged either of these can be affected. Conscious processes are controlled by the somatic nervous system, these are voluntary movements for example the contraction of the striated muscle of the external anal sphincter is instructed to do so by the brain, which sends signals along the nerves innervating this muscle. Subconscious processes are controlled by the autonomic nervous system; these are involuntary movements such as contraction of the smooth muscle of the internal anal sphincter or the colon. The autonomic nervous system also provides sensory information; this could be about the level of distension within the colon or rectum.  Diagnosis  This image shows constipation in a young child as seen on X- ray. In order to correctly manage neurogenic bowel dysfunction it is important to accurately diagnose it. This can be done by a variety of methods, the most commonly used would be taking a clinical history and carrying out physical examinations which may include: abdominal, neurological and rectal examinations. Patients may use the Bristol Stool Chart to help them describe and characterise the morphological features of their stool, this is useful as it gives an indication of the transit time. An objective method used to evaluate the motility of the colon and help with diagnosis is the colon transit time. Another helpful test to diagnose this condition may be an abdominal X- ray as this can show the distribution of the faeces and show any abnormalities with the colon for example a megacolon. Methods used for diagnosis may vary depending on if the patient is incontinent or constipated Management The management plan for this condition is individualised and will depend on the symptoms experienced and the cause. There is limited evidence on the best approach for neurogenic bowel dysfunction and research is still being carried out in to this. A variety of options may be tried depending on the patient, and the patient will be best advised on their most appropriate management by their general practitioner. Some of the treatment or management plans include: diet modification, laxatives, digital stimulation, manual evacuation of faeces and abdominal massage. More information can be found on these different techniques on the following pages: faecal incontinence and constipation.

The monument hosts the grave of Ziaur Rahman the 7th president of Bangladesh, famous for his declaration of independence of Bangladesh on 26 and 27 March 1971. He was a notable Leader in the south Asian region of the 20th century. The monument was constructed by GBB Limited with consultation of Bashat Architects Engineers Ltd and executed under the Public works department and department of architecture.  History  The mausoleum of Ziaur Rahman is often known as Zia uddan. Ziaur Rahman (Bengali: ‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶â‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶π‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶® Ji-yaur R√¥hman; 19 January 1936, was the 7th President of Bangladesh. He was an army general turned politician. He became President of Bangladesh on 21 April 1977, he was assassinated on 30 May 1981 in Chittagong by Bangladeshi army personnel. The president of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman, has been assassinated in the south-eastern city of Chittagong. President Zia is believed to have died at 0430 local time when rebels stormed the Chittagong Circuit House. He is reported to have been killed by sub- machine-gun bullets when he opened the door of his room to see what was happening outside. Eight people are thought to have died in the shooting, including a security officer, an officer who was guarding the president and one of the attackers. Later the burial was relocated from Chittagong to parliament area. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party have given ultimatum regarding the news of relocation of the mausoleum complex from parliament area.

Her widower, Ludovic Chab√©, was convicted of her murder in 2013, but was acquitted on appeal in 2015.  Biography  Fran√ßoise Chab√© was born in 1976. She was described as cheerful and optimistic. She was a secretary at an agricultural wholesaler in Beaumetz-l√®s- Loges. She was married to Ludovic Chab√©, a firefighter based at the fire station in Montreuil, in the suburbs of Paris. Ludovic was described by his superiors as being of an exemplary character. At the time of her murder, Fran√ßoise was pursuing an extramarital affair with a colleague known only as St√©phane Q.  Murder and investigation  On 2 February 2005, St√©phane Q. had a 17-minute telephone call with Fran√ßoise, in which he told her that he was ending their relationship after learning that his wife was pregnant with their second child. In early February 2005, those nearest to Fran√ßoise noticed her mood change; she had become anxious and tired. Fran√ßoise confided in a colleague: \\"Now it will never be like it was before.\\" On 26 February 2005, Fran√ßoise was strangled with a scarf at her home in Humbercourt. Fran√ßoise's husband, Ludovic, discovered her body upon returning home from a 48-hour firefighting shift. He found Fran√ßoise lying face down on the living-room floor. Fran√ßoise was still wearing her hearing protection device that she used for sleeping. Ludovic turned Fran√ßoise onto her back and unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate her. He phoned the fire brigade at 10.04 a.m. and firefighters arrived at the home at 10.15 a.m. Police detectives found a cigarette butt on the floor and threw it in the bin. Semen was found in Fran√ßoise's vagina but was not stored correctly and could not be analysed. The forensic pathologist determined Fran√ßoise's cause of death to be strangulation. There were no defensive wounds. Fran√ßoise's house was not sealed off in the way that crime scenes usually are. On 27 February 2005, the day after the murder, Fran√ßoise's family cleaned the house. Investigators quickly abandoned the theory of a prowler, and Ludovic became their prime suspect. A neighbour reported seeing Fran√ßoise alive through her window between 9 and 9.30 a.m. on 26 February. The same neighbour stated that she then saw Ludovic arrive at the property at 9.30 a.m. Ludovic had been browsing online dating websites and had had a brief fling with a colleague. Ludovic was quickly arrested. He proclaimed his innocence. The investigators questioned his mother and sister, orchestrating proceedings in such a way that Ludovic could see the interrogation from a neighbouring room. On 3 May 2005, the exhausted Ludovic admitting to killing Fran√ßoise by accident during a game. According to his statement, the game was intended to play out as follows: Fran√ßoise would be standing up, with Ludovic standing behind her. Ludovic would spread his arms out and clap them shut in front of him. Fran√ßoise had to duck before Ludovic's arms came together. However, according to Ludovic, Fran√ßoise did not duck quickly enough and his palms slammed against both sides of her head, knocking her unconscious. Ludovic later renounced his confession. He claimed that the examining magistrate sought only to gather evidence favouring the prosecution and ignored exculpatory evidence. According to Ludovic, the police put him under pressure to confess, telling him that if he did not do so, his mother would be charged with the murder.  Trial  On 10 June 2013, Ludovic Chab√©'s trial began at the Court of Assizes of the Somme d√©partement in Amiens. His defence barrister was Philippe Valent, while the prosecution barrister was Philippe Bordereau. On 12 June 2013, Chab√© was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. He appealed against the verdict. On 29 May 2015, Chab√©'s appeal began at the Court of Assizes of the Oise d√©partement in Beauvais. On 5 June 2015, Chab√©'s conviction was quashed and he was formally acquitted of the crime.

Life and career Delage was born in Vierzon in central France. He was a student at the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied the viola with Maurice Vieux and the history of music with Norbert Dufourcq.

With this ensemble he revived old French music including that of Guillaume de Machaut and Andr√© Campra, and played modern works by composers from Bart√≥k to Georges Migot, Charles Koechlin and Jean Fran√ßaix. Between 1972 and 1990 he lectured on chamber music at the Conservatoire de Strasbourg, and from 1976 to 1985, the history of music, at Strasbourg and Nancy. Delage died in Strasbourg at the age of 78. Books and journal articles The best-known aspect of Delage's work is his musicology, and particularly his research into and publications about Emmanuel Chabrier. Delage's obituarist in the Revue de Musicologie commented that although Delage was not the first proponent of Chabrier's importance in French music, he was the most constant and the most knowledgeable. In 1963 he presented a series of radio programmes on France Culture, Ce sacr√© Chabrier, subsequently adapted for Roland-Manuel's Histoire de la musique in the Encyclop√©die de la Pl√©iade. His first book on the composer was published in 1982 ‚Äì a 214-page, bilingual French and English \\"musical iconography\\" illustrated with numerous photographs, drawings and paintings of Chabrier and his circle.

Most recently he was the co-host, along with Chris Buskirk, of the Phoenix-based talk show, The Seth and Chris Show. He resigned from the show in order to run for the House Seat vacated by Kyrsten Sinema. However, when the consulting group his campaign hired to spearhead the campaign failed to collect the required number of signatures to appear on the ballot, he was forced to withdraw from the race. Currently he hosts The Seth Leibsohn Show on KKNT in Phoenix. Biography Leibsohn was born on November 17, 1967 in Phoenix, Arizona, the son of Marian and Eugene Leibsohn. He did his undergraduate work at Pitzer College, his post-graduate work at Claremont Graduate University, and obtained his law degree from Northeastern University School of Law. During his college days Leibsohn was a liberal, and credited Harry V. Jaffa with having led him into conservative thought. While a student, Leibsohn had written an article which had strongly criticized Jaffa. Instead of confronting Leibsohn, Jaffa set out to introduce him to a \\"line of thought and reason I never even knew existed, walked me through everything he could teach me, and never let go ... He changed my whole life.\\" Career In 2011, he was selected by Rick Santorum as his senior advisor for policy, and served in Santorum's PAC. He was a vice-president of two of the nation's premier think tanks, Empower America and the Claremont Institute. His is also a senior editor at American Greatness, a conservative online journal. He was also the former director of policy for the Jewish Policy Center. In 2015, Leibsohn became the chairman of the anti-legalizing marijuana advocacy group, \\"Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy\\", which opposed the attempt to get a legalizing marijuana referendum on the 2016 ballot. The group was credited as being a primary force in defeating an attempt to make marijuana in Arizona legal in 2016. As a radio host, in 2016, Leibsohn interviewed Kelli Ward, then a candidate in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate going up against John McCain. During the interview Ward made the following comment as part of a longer response to Leibsohn's query about how the U.S. should respond to ISIS: \\"We can't continue with this strategy of go in and do nation building, try to spread democracy, and unfortunately we had that policy under George W. Bush as well. It isn't what traditional conservative foreign policy has been, which is restraint and realism. Those things need to be brought back into the process in the foreign policy arena. I think that we also, we have to be willing to decimate ISIS - not control them, not to curb their activities.\\" The one comment, \\"restraint and realism\\", became the theme of several anti-Ward commercials in both the 2016 and 2018 Republican primaries, in an attempt to show that Ward was weak on terrorism. After the death of Aretha Franklin in 2018, when Bill Clinton, Louis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson all appeared on stage together, Leibsohn posited the question, \\"What do you think would be said about Donald Trump, President Trump, if he were on a stage at a big event with someone who said, ‚ÄòSatanic Jews have infected the whole world with poison and deceit‚Äô?‚Äù Author He has co-authored several books during the course of his career. In 2011, with Bill Bennett, he co-authored The Fight of Our Lives, a study of America's current battle against radical Islam. In 2017 he and his fellow radio commentator Chris Buskirk wrote American Greatness, an analysis of how many of establishment conservatives, the Washington elite, and the mainstream media were so out of step with the 2016 Presidential election. Congressional run In September 2017, Leibsohn announced his intention to run for the congressional seat vacated by Kirsten Sinema, who was leaving her District 9 House seat to run for the U.S. Senate. Rick Santorum endorsed his run for Congress. However, after the political consulting group Leibsohn had hired to guide his candidacy had failed to collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot, Leibsohn was forced to withdraw from the race.

He headed the group \\"Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy\\", which was instrumental in preventing the legalization of marijuana in Arizona. He has co-authored several articles with Bill Bennett regarding the dangers of marijuana, which got picked up in numerous newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and The Tampa Tribune. In January 1987, as a senior in Arcadia High School, Leibsohn was a proponent for Arizona proclaiming a holiday to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr.; in June 1987, Arizona proclaimed a \\"Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day\\", to be held coincident with the national day each January.

It superseded the technique of transvesical prostatectomy used by Peter Freyer, where the prostate was removed through the bladder. Millin graduated in medicine in 1927 from Dublin University after also gaining a degree in maths and arts, and representing both his university and Ireland at rugby. He first became a house surgeon at Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, following which he gained postgraduate qualifications and moved to London with a travelling scholarship. Here, he came across the Irish urologist Edward Canny Ryall at All Saints‚Äô Hospital in Pimlico, and in 1934, inherited Ryall's practice. His three-page article on the retropubic prostatectomy, published in The Lancet on 1 December 1945, demonstrated a method of removing the prostate without the traditional cut through the bladder, thus reducing complications, and he became renowned for the procedure. He later moved back to Ireland, served as president of the British Association of Urological Surgeons between 1953 and 1955, and also as president of the British Association of Urological Surgeons. He was given honorary membership of the Urological Section of the Royal Society of Medicine, and in 1963 was elected president of Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland RCSI.  Early life  Terence Millin was born on 9 January 1903 into a protestant family in Helen's Bay, County Down, Northern Ireland. Millin Bay in Co. Down is named after the family. Related to Sir James Pitcairn, surgeon and descended from the ancient Pitcairn family of that Ilk, Fifeshire and a cousin of Edward John Chalmers Morton of Frocester Court, Glos, MP for Davenport, his father was a successful barrister and honorary librarian of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland. He began his early education at the Abbey School in Tipparary. In 1907, his family moved to Dublin and he then completed his education at St Andrew's College. He played rugby for St Andrews, which in 1921 won the Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup.Bouchier-Hayes, David Terence Millin: pioneer of the retropubic space. British Journal of Urology International. Vol. 96, Issue 6 (29 October 2019), pp. 768-771. After completing school, he gained admission to Trinity College Dublin in 1921, with a scholarship to study arts and mathematics. Later, he changed career path and gained a place to study medicine. He also represented both Dublin University and Ireland at rugby. He graduated in medicine in 1927.  Career  Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital He first became a house surgeon at Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, a familiar hospital where he had spent time as a medical student. Within the first year, he passed the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland at first attempt, and achieved the conjoint diploma of the London Royal Colleges (Royal College of Surgeons of England and Royal College of Physicians of London). He was awarded a travelling fellowship from Dublin University and moved to London where he took up jobs at the Middlesex Hospital and Guy‚Äôs Hospital. Subsequently, he entered the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Great Portland Street, and the All Saints‚Äô Hospital in Pimlico, where he came across the Irish urologist Edward Canny Ryall. In 1930 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the following year took the optional subject of genito-urinary surgery in his MCh examination at Dublin, when he came first place. In 1934, following the death of Ryall, Millin took over his position at All Saints and his private practice at 75 Harley Street. On 1 December 1945 The Lancet published a three-page article by Millin on a surgical approach to the partial or complete removal of the prostate, for benign large prostates, ‚ÄúRetropubic Prostatectomy. A new extravesical technique: report on twenty cases‚Äù, a procedure he had demonstrated at the French Urological Society in Paris in the preceding October. The operation involved a direct incision into the abdomen and the removal of the prostate through the retropubic space. The use of sulphonamides reduced mortality by infection and Millin became renowned for the procedure. He followed this up two years later with his book titled Retropubic Urinary Surgery which contained further observations on prostatectomies and other surgical procedures. The procedure came to be known as the Millin Retropubic Prostatectomy and it superseded the technique of transvesical prostatectomy used by Peter Freyer.Marchant, Nick. Diseases of the Prostate. Office of Health Economics, London (1995). P. 11. ISSN:04738837Ellis, Harold. \\"The Birth of Modern Surgery\\" in A History of Surgery. Greenwich Medical Media Limited, London (2001), p. 121-122. In 1950, he moved back to Ireland to 150-acre Georgian estate, ‚ÄúByblox‚Äù, near Cork. His social circle included the novelist Elizabeth Bowen, writer Edward, 5th Baron Sackville, The Slazengers of Powerscourt and Stephen and Lady Ursula Vernon of Bruree, the latter a daughter of 'Bendor', 2nd Duke of Westminster. In the late 1950s, he worked with pioneering nurse educator Eithne O‚ÄôDomhnaill.Key influence in raising profile and the standard of Irish nursing. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Irish Times‚Äô‚Äô. 2 September 2000. He later moved to County Wicklow, and later lived at the palladian villa of Knockmore Enniskerry and Kilcoole. Awards and honours Between 1953 and 1955, he served as president of the British Association of Urological Surgeons and was given honorary membership of the Urological Section of the Royal Society of Medicine. He was elected president of RCSI for 1963-1966. He was a recipient of the St Peter's Medal. Death and legacy In 1980 he died of cancer of the larynx. The RCSI commemorates him in the annual Millin Scientific Meeting.

He was considered to be one of the most top voice dubbers for many animated films and cartoons for audiences across Italy. Biography Born in Pomezia, which is in Rome, Latini started out working as a singer in nightclubs in the early 1950s, then he went on to work in the theatre and star in the 1953 film The World Condemns Them. Among Latini's most popular filmography includes the 1966 musical-comedy film Mondo pazzo... gente matta! starring Silvana Pampanini and the 1976 film The Black Maid starring Carla Brait. Despite Latini's popularity working as an actor, he was also heavily active as a voice actor.Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian) He dubbed Stan Laurel in several redubs of Laurel and Hardy shorts and films in which he was paired up with Carlo Croccolo. He also dubbed characters in many animated productions. He was the first voice of Skeletor in Masters of the Universe and from 1983 until 1988, he was the primary Italian voice of Donald Duck and he even dubbed Tom from Tom & Jerry and various characters from Looney Tunes and The Muppet Show. Latini founded his own dubbing company in the late 1970s, which was active until some point during the 1980s. In 1981, he lost one of his legs in an accident, which rendered him unable to perform on screen. After that, he devoted himself exclusively to dubbing. =Personal life= Latini had three children, daughters Laura Latini (1969-2012) and Ilaria Latini (born 1972) from his relationship with dialogue writer Maria Pinto and son Fabrizio Vidale (born 1970) from his relationship with actress Piera Vidale. All three followed in Latini's footsteps. Death Latini died of a stroke at the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic in Rome on the evening of February 2, 1991 at the age of 63.

His primary interest was in fetal medicine, a branch of obstetrics and gynaecology that focuses on the assessment of the development, growth and health of the baby in the womb. He was also an early proponent of subspecialisation within the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology, a practice that is common today. He was Regius Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow from 1976 until his retirement in 1992. Early life and education Charlie Whitfield was born in 1927 to Charles and Aileen Whitfield in Secunderabad, India, where his father, himself an obstetrician and gynaecologist, was serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). He attended Cabin Hill School and Campbell College Belfast 1942‚Äì1945, where he represented the school at Rugby Football, Cricket and Shooting 1944‚Äì1945 and was secretary of the Debating Society 1944‚Äì1945. He subsequently took a degree in medicine at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast where he graduated MB BCh BAO in 1950. In 1953 he married Marion Douglas McKinney in Belfast. Career Whitfield began his career with resident appointments in the Belfast Teaching Hospitals 1951‚Äì1953. He then served in the RAMC 1953‚Äì1964 as junior and senior specialist in obstetrics and was posted to David Bruce Royal Naval Hospital Mtarfa, Malta 1954‚Äì1957, Louise Margaret Hospital, Aldershot 1957‚Äì1959, BMH (British Military Hospital) Colchester 1959‚Äì1960, and BMH Singapore 1960‚Äì1963. He left the army in 1964 having reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. = Belfast, electronic fetal monitoring and rhesus disease = Whitfield returned to Northern Ireland as senior lecturer in midwifery and gynaecology, Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, and honorary consultant, Belfast Teaching Hospitals 1964‚Äì1968. He was made MD in 1965. He later became consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Belfast Teaching Hospitals 1968‚Äì1974 and honorary reader, Queen‚Äôs University Belfast 1971‚Äì1974. In 1964 he was granted an honorary attachment to the department of Ian Donald, the medical ultrasound pioneer from Glasgow, whom he would later succeed. Whitfield was then awarded the United States Public Health Service Research Fellowship under Edward H. Hon at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, and Stanley T. Lee at the Loma Linda University Medical Centre, California 1964‚Äì1965. He returned to Belfast where he was the first to practice Hon's electronic fetal heart rate monitoring methods. This was a period of change in his field, when obstetricians \\"gradually changed their motto from that of Masterly Inactivity to that of Active Intervention\\". Whitfield later reflected on this period, comparing the plight of the fetus, the \\"second patient\\", to that of the early astronauts: \\"The fetus was, of course, the subject that was really exercising most of us, and of our two patients, it is the one that, generally speaking, is at most danger. And this was at a time when astronauts were beginning to go up in the sky and ... they were able to stick transducers on the astronauts so nobody ever had to ask them what they were doing, or how they were feeling, and they didn‚Äôt even need to take pictures of them. In the meantime, here was the fetus and all we could do was listen to its heartbeat and try to feel its outline\\". He concluded, \\"it was now that fetal phonocardiography and electrocardiography and ultrasound became the parents of real fetal medicine\\". Whitfield concentrated on research into the management of pregnancies affected by Rhesus haemolytic disease, a condition that affected 15% of all admissions to Belfast's Royal Maternity Hospital at one time. Assessing the severity of cases through the analysis of amniotic fluid, he developed his Action Line method 1968 to determine the timing of necessary intervention either by premature induced delivery or by fetal transfusion. The Action Line method resulted in striking reductions in both fetal mortality and prematurity in Rhesus-affected pregnancies. = Glasgow and ultrasound = After a short spell as Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Manchester and Honorary Consultant at the University Hospital of South Manchester 1974‚Äì1976, Whitfield took up his final position as Regius Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow and Honorary Consultant at the Queen Mother's Hospital and Western Infirmary 1976, succeeding Ian Donald with whom he had first worked 12 years previously. He was made FRCS(G) in 1977 and retired Emeritus Regius Professor of Midwifery (Glasgow) in 1992. The use of ultrasound in medicine was pioneered by Donald, first at Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital and subsequently at Glasgow's new maternity hospital, the Queen Mother's Hospital (QMH), which opened in 1964. Developments in ultrasound complemented Whitfield's own research interests in fetal medicine but was still regarded with scepticism in some quarters. Whitfield had more success in gaining acceptance for obstetric ultrasound than Donald himself, who was sometimes viewed as an obsessive eccentric. As he recalled, \\"an honorary attachment with Professor Donald in Glasgow in 1964 had convinced me that obstetric ultrasound did have a future, but later in that year in America I was told it was just a dream of a mad, red-headed Scotsman, so I should forget it! I was told confidentially, nothing, no good will come of it, but of course that was wrong\\". By the end of the 1980s, 87% of pregnant women in Scotland would undergo at least one ultrasound scan during the course of their pregnancy, a task increasingly undertaken by midwives (as opposed to doctors or radiologists), an innovation first introduced at QMH. = Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) = Throughout his career, Whitfield played an active role in the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). He became a Member (MRCOG) in 1959, a Fellow (FRCOG) in 1969, was a member of the Gynaecological Visiting Society (GVS) and a member of RCOG Council 1985‚Äì1991. He gave the William Blair-Bell memorial lecture entitled \\"Obstetric Sprue\\" in 1969. Whitfield embarked on two travelling assignments on behalf of the college: the Bernhard Baron Travelling Fellowship to the United States in 1974, and the Sims Black Travelling Professorship to Thailand and Bangladesh in 1985. He served on numerous College committees, boards and working parties. Principal among these was his role as chairman of the Working Party on Subspecialisation, which published its report in 1982. The working party recommended a less formal approach to subspecialisation whereby generalists could develop an interest in a subspecialty field without undertaking full training. Many in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology had to be convinced of the merits of these recommendations. To that end Whitfield, along with members of the working party, embarked on a tour of the country to convince the doubters. Their success in this venture led to the formation of the RCOG Subspecialty Committee 1984 which, to this day, advises on the development of subspecialisation in the four fields of gynaecological oncology, reproductive medicine, maternal and fetal medicine, and urogynaecology. = Editorships = * Medical Disorders in Pregnancy 1977. * Dewhurst‚Äôs Textbook of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for Undergraduates, 4th and 5th editions 1986 and 1995.

Biography A native from the village of Nagorny in Altai Krai, Yudin lived with his mother and brother. After the end of 8th grade of secondary school, he served in the army, and following his discharge, he left for the Novosibirsk Oblast, to the city of Iskitim, where he worked at a construction site. From an early age, acquaintances noted Yudin's sullenness and his stiffness in communicating with people. According to them, his character changed only when in a state of intoxication. In the summer of 1998, Yudin moved to the city of Berdsk, where he met a woman and began living with her, also starting work as a constructor. On August 12, 1998, Yudin met a lone woman near the Berdsk plant \\"Giant\\", offering to take her home. Then, when they arrived at a deserted location, he attacked, raped and tried to strangle her. However, the victim survived, as the attacker was scared off by plant workers who were on a morning shift. The woman appealed to the police, but Yudin was not caught. A year later, in the summer of 1999, the Yudin committed his first murder. He dragged a 16-year-old girl into the bushes next to a bus stop, and raped her for about an hour. This time, despite hearing the footsteps of random passers-by, he did not run away. The victim tried to attract attention, but did not succeed. Yudin strangled her, took her watch and earrings and then left. Hours later, he gave the watch to his wife, and the earrings to his mother. In the autumn of 1999, the construction team in which Yudin worked was sent to Novosibirsk. On November 23, while intoxicated, Yudin raped and killed a girl in her own apartment. He then took the victim's fur coat and gave it to his wife. A month later, Yudin was detained for attempted robbery. Six months after that, he was amnestied in connection with the celebration of the 55th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War, and on July 14, 2000, Yudin went free. In August‚ÄìSeptember 2000, Yudin committed two more murders. He lured his victims to deserted places, in the plantations of Berdsk in particular. From one of his victims, a student of the Novosibirsk Conservatory returning from a musical concert rehearsal, he took a flute. Yudin often sat for a long time in his barn, where he admired his trophies. On October 18, he tried to rape a female acquaintance in her own apartment, but she, having fiercely resisted, kicked him out. He then paid a bribe to his unfortunate victim so that she would not report him to the police. Meanwhile, panic broke out in the city. Since Yudin preferred petite brunettes dressed in form-fitting pants, almost every fifth resident of Berdsk could be a possible suspect. Girls tried to return home before dark, and schoolgirls were met by parents after lessons, with many women changing their clothing and changing their hair color. The next murder Yudin committed occurred two years later, in December 2002. The victim was a girl whom he killed in her apartment. In this case, a man named Alexei Vyacheslavovich Gaskov, who had been contained several times in a drunk tank, confessed to the murder, but it was later revealed that it was a false confession. = Arrest, trial and sentence = In September 2003, Yudin was arrested, but was soon released under parole. In the meantime, a genetic examination was conducted, which confirmed that all of the murders were committed by him. He was taken back into custody and soon confessed to committing five murders and 23 cases of brigandage, robberies and rapes. The forensic psychiatric examination recognized Mikhail Yudin as fully sane and responsible for his actions. On June 7, 2004, the case was referred to the court, which on December 2, Yudin was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without changing it, and Yudin is currently serving his sentence at the Polar Owl prison.

History The origins of the Slavic-Eurasian Research Center‚Äôs go back to the Cold War. A year after the end of the US occupation of Japan (28 April 1952), a decision was taken at Hokkaido University on 24 June 1953 to coordinate research and activities of scholars who did research within the broad remit of Soviet and Communist studies or Area studies. Two years later, on 1 June 1955, the group was formalized as a Slavic Institute, incorporated in the University‚Äôs Faculty of Law. On 1 April 1978 this Institute gained organizational independence and was renamed as the Slavic Research Center (SRC). In recognition of the geopolitical changes that followed the end of communism in Europe and the breakup of the Soviet Union (thus obviating the validity of Communist studies), on 1 April 2014, the Center was renamed as the Slavic-Eurasian Research Center (SRC).

It was discovered to be the asexual state of a member of the ascomycete genus, Chaetomium. The name B. piluliferum now applies to the fungus in all its states. B. piluliferum has been found worldwide in a wide range of habitats such as animal dung and vegetation. The colonies of this fungus start off white and grow rapidly to a brown colour. The conidia are smooth and white. B. piluliferum grows optimally at a temperature of 25-30 ¬∞C and a pH of 5.5.  History and taxonomy  B. piluliferum was first described in Belgium from rabbit dung. The anamorph was discovered by Pier Andrea Saccardo and Marchal in 1885. The teleomorph, Chaetomium piluliferum was named by J. Daniels in 1961 from a culture of B. piluliferum on cellulose film. The culture produced underdeveloped perithecia typical of those seen in the genus Chaetomium but was not connected to any known species at the time. The culture also produced phialospores and dark hyphae that were characteristic of B. piluliferum. Daniels described this as the teleomorph of B. piluliferum and named it C. piluliferum. A dried type specimen of the teleomorph was studied and found to be similar to C. murorum, a species described by Corda in 1837. This fungus contained narrower ascospores, longer hairs of ascomata, and was absent of aleurioconidia and an anamorph. The conidiophores of C. piluliferum resemble that of C. piluliferoides which was discovered by Udagawa and Horie in 1975. C. piluliferoides produces aleurioconidia 5-7.5 Œºm in diameter and ascomata that are 200-240 x 120-145 Œºm containing short terminal hairs of 200-250 Œºm and spindle-shaped ascospores. Hawksworth stated that understanding C. piluliferum could not be done using only the anamorph and expressed the need for further research on the Botryotrichum states which occur in three Farrowia and eight other Chaetomium species. C. piluliferum has the most complex conidiophores, (sub)hyaline aleurioconidia, and a thick wall. The others, such as B. atrogriseum, discovered by van Beyma in 1928 and B. peruvianum, discovered by Matsushima in 1975 have similar-sized aleurioconidia and are pigmented.  Growth and morphology  The colonies of B. piluliferum are fast-growing. They can spread from 2.0-4.3 cm in diameter in one week when grown at . The colonies start off as white aerial mycelium which can become a yellowish-beige colour by the subsequent production of brown, rough-walled sterile setae. These brown setae are about 250 x 2-5 Œºm and bumpy or encrusted near their base. The conidiophores branch at right angles to the main axis. They are smooth, colourless, and produce conidia at their ends. The conidia are thick-walled, hyaline (white), smooth, and spherical. They are approximately 9-16 Œºm in diameter. B. piluliferum also contains branched hyaline conidiophores that produce aleurioconidia in clusters. The aleurioconidia are globose and typically 3.0-3.5 Œºm thick. The fungus can produce chains of phialoconidia as well. Ascomata in B. piluliferum are rare and reach maturity in four weeks at . They are black, with a globose to subglobose shape. The lateral and terminal hairs of the ascomata are 500-1500 Œºm long, 4-6 Œºm wide with an olive-brown colour and may contain tips with are rolled in a flat coil towards the center. The pale brown ascospores are ellipsoidal (or football-shaped) and contain one germ pore that is roughly 13-16 x 8-10.5 Œºm. Mating behaviour of the fungus is unknown because single- spore cultures lose the ability to produce ascomata. The teleomorph C. piluliferum is made up of colonies containing brown hyphae with rough and bumpy hairs. C. piluliferum ascomata are superficial and spherical or obovate (oval-shaped with a narrow base, like a light bulb. They contain a small pore on the top called and ostiole that allow spores to pass through. The perithecia have brown or reddish walls and are covered with thick-walled, septate ascomatal hairs that are long, brown, with many bends and turns, often with tightly-coiled tips. The asci are obovate (light bulb-shaped) or broadly clavate (baseball bat-shaped), have a short stalk and contain 8 spores. Phialoconidia form from the apex towards the base in the form of droplets on clustered flask-shaped cells.  Physiology  B. piluliferum has an optimal growth temperature range of , with its maximum growth temperature at . The fungus cannot tolerate acid. It can grow in alkaline pH greater than 8.8, however its optimal pH is 5.5. This allows for decomposition of starch, pectin and xylan. B. piluliferum produces mycotoxins that are metabolically similar to aflatoxin. A mycotoxin isolated from B. piluliferum, sterigmatocystin, is involved in the synthesis pathway of aflatoxin. In comparison to other species like Trichoderma aureoviride, that has been found to be very susceptible to parasites, B. piluliferum shows greater resistance to mycoparasites such as Pythium oligandrum. B. piluliferum also produces the metabolite cochliodinol A.  Habitat and ecology  B. piluliferum is found worldwide. It has been isolated and recorded in many countries such as Canada, the United States, The Netherlands, and South Africa. It has been found on deer and goat dung in Denmark and field mouse dung in England. The fungus is rarely found in soils, however, it can be found at depths of 80 cm below soil. It has been reported in mountainous regions, salt marshes, and cedar forests. It has also been isolated from stems of Urtica dioica, hay, rhizospheres of groundnut, rice and wheat, paper products, and mouldy textiles, as well as in the seeds of chili pepper. B. piluliferum is a food source for Pygmephorus mesembrinae and P. quadratus. When in vitro, it can be parasitized by Pythium oligandrum.

D'Esnambuc was the first governor and lieutenant general for the king on the islands of America, holding office from 1626 to December 1636. He had established the French colony on Saint Christophe. In 1635 he was confirmed as lieutenant general by the newly created Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique and authorized to colonize Martinique. D'Esnambuc landed in Martinique with 100 experienced men on 15 September 1635. He was accompanied by Jean Dupont, lieutenant of the company in Saint Christophe. Dupont was a relative of d'Enambuc. 1656 map of the island, still divided between French in the west and Caribs in the east D'Esnambuc made a treaty with the Island Caribs. He quickly built a fort beside the sea, which he named Fort Saint-Pierre. He also built a residence, then returned to Saint Christophe in November 1635. He named Dupont as the first local governor of Martinique. Dupont was appointed on 17 September 1625. He was described as a man of great courage and prudence. After d'Esnambuc left the Caribs attacked the fort, but Dupont defeated them. The Caribs retired to the Cabesterre (east) section of the island, or to other islands. Dupont was returning to Saint Christophe to confer with d'Enambuc when he was wrecked in a storm on the shore of Santo Domingo. The Spanish took him prisoner and held him in close captivity for three years. Thinking Dupont was dead, d'Esnambuc appointed his nephew Jacques Dyel du Parquet to replace him.

Bernard Picard . 1925-1998.  History  In 1948, Chief Rabbi Jacob Kaplan, with the help of Suzanne Aron, created a Jewish lyc√©e that he named √âcole Yabn√©, in memory of the Yeshiva founded in Yavne by Yohanan ben Zakkai after the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem by the Romans in the 70s CE. He received help from Rabbi √âlie Munk; Chief Rabbi Henri Schilli; and the communities of the Adas Yereim Synagogue (Rue Cadet), the Rue de Montevideo Synagogue, the Rue Pavee Synagogue, and Synagogue Rashi (Rue Ambroise-Thomas), all in Paris. To run the school, Suzanne Aron called upon Albert Cr√©mieux. In 1948, the school was on the grounds of the Gustave de Rothschild Foundation,A former Rothschild school, occupied by the √âcole Ma√Ømonide at its start (1935-1938), later requisitioned during the Second World War, then used as a reception centre during the Liberation at 60 rue Claude-Bernard, in the Latin Quarter. There was not enough room in the small building to accommodate all the students. The solution was to teach half the students in the morning, and half in the afternoon. Some classes took place in the S√©minaire isra√©lite de France, a rabbinical seminary located at 9 rue Vauquelin. This situation continued until the construction, in the 1960s, of a multi-story building, in the same location, that was far more spacious and could accommodate all classes. This building was opened on 2 May 1965. The building included a gym and a refectory, amenities the school had for the first time. In 1976, in agreement with the centre, Rachi classes took place from the first year to the final year. √âcole Yabn√© could then accommodate 750 students. In 1993, the school left the Latin Quarter for the Porte d'Italie. It is currently the largest Jewish college in France. It has more than 1000 students from kindergarten to the final year of high school. The primary school is called √âcole Yabn√©-Henri Schilli.See √âcole Yabn√© Henri Schilli.  Lyc√©e ranking  In 2015, the lyc√©e ranked 47th out of 109 at the departmental level, in terms of teaching quality, and 452nd at the national level. The ranking is based on three criteria: the bac results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur√©at after two years at the establishment, and the added value (based on the social origin of students, their age, and their national diploma results).

Early life and family Phyo Myat Aung was born on 9 July 1992 in Hinthada, Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar. Born to an amateur musical family in a district town in Ayeyarwady delta, he was not a stranger to music since he was young. His father was an amateur traditional guitar player and his mother was an amateur singer. His maternal grandfather was a traditional trumpet player. Career =Beginning and competition= Phyo Myat Aung started singing mono songs along with his parents in street performances since he was 8 years old. At the age of ten, he was introduced Rock music by one of his uncles and he fell in love with this genre instantly. Since then he inspired to become a rock singer. The adolescent years were very harsh for him as the family fell into financial hardship. He used to have just a pair of school uniform and even barely had meals during lunch time. Those unfortunate things led him into engaging street fights. He finally ended his education as a high school dropout. Despite those spiral-downward personal hardship, his affection to music and inspiration to become a singer had never gone away. He started stage singing with a local band in the vicinity of his home town since he was 14. He adopted a stage-name Agni which means ‚Äòborn from fire‚Äô to echo his harsh life. He had limited success with his local band and performed in various local events. But he barely made living by his singing career and faced immense pressure to abandon his passion of singing and start a more stable career as a driver, etc. He faced many backlashes in social and professional life due to his relatively poor social and financial background. He ordained into monkshood following the tradition of a Burmese male. This made him to expose more to the teaching of Buddha about life, and refresh thoughts about his life and ambitions. He changed his way of life gradually since then. A breakthrough moment came when a friend suggested to enter audition for Myanmar Idol Season 3. He borrowed money to travel to a nearby town for Myanmar Idol audition. He was the first contestant from that audition session to go for the next level of competition. He passed through several stages of the competition to become one of Top 11 finalists. His frankness and child-like naiveness appealed to the wider range of TV viewers around the country during the live broadcasts of Myanmar Idol. His polite and respectful manners, his adoration of his mother and his strong religious beliefs and practices as a devote Buddhist won millions of hearts, young and old, male and female, around the Buddhist- majority country. Just before the Grand final Week of the competition, his home-coming journey was overwhelmingly welcomed by millions of people from Ayeyarwady delta and was a record crowd for any kind of artists in the region.·Äî·Äæ·ÄØ·Äê·Ä∫·ÄÅ·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÜ·ÄÄ·Ä∫ ·ÄÖ·ÄÄ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äî·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫ ·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äû·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äë·ÄÖ·Äõ·Ä¨ ·Äï·Äõ·Ä≠·Äû·Äê·Ä∫·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏ He subsequently won the competition.

Starting out as a cofradia founded by the Dominicans, the Guardia de Honor became increasingly militant during the Philippine Revolution. The First Philippine Republic and the subsequent colonial government both saw the Guardia de Honor as brigands and tulisanes and sought to suppress them. The Guardia de Honor was most active in the provinces of Pangasinan and Tarlac, and was active alongside the similar Santa Iglesia movement in Pampanga. History =Origins= The Guardia de Honor was founded by Dominican priests in the Pangasinan as a confraternity whose purpose was to instill devotion to the Virgin Mary in its followers. Juan Alvarez Guerro in De Manila a Tayabas wrote about the confraternities in Lucban, particularly about the Guardia de Honor, describing the society as a women's association \\"which entertains no distinction of class or age\\". Members were distinguished by a silver medal hanging on a blue ribbon. The organization was described as perfectly organized and based upon the continuous veneration of the Virgin. The hermana mayor would assign three sisters to pray in shifts throughout the day and night. This was done without fail. Alvarez Guerro noted that during some days of Lent and the Holy Week, members of the Guardia de Honor would go to a mountain called El Calvario to give offerings to Mary. Of particular note is the offering given at the end of the last novena of May, as all the flowers and foliage of the temple is recharged, with a colossal rosary made of vegetables that is suspended from the vault, descending from the center of the nave forming pavilions and ending in the presbytery with a cross made of flowers. The feast ends by offering dahlias at the feet of the Virgin. The adherents are described to be dressed immaculately in satin, like brides. The Guardia de Honor particularly found popularity among adherents in Pangasinan and contiguous provinces. By 1877 the cofradia had spread as far as Tarlac and Pampanga. The size of its membership justified division between regional and local units. Alvarez Guerrero's account, in particular, described proceedings of the Guardia de Honor in Tayabas (now Quezon) province. =Radicalization during the Philippine Revolution= By the 1890s a wave of revolutionary fervor had changed the Guardia de Honor to something more radical. The group's activities are unclear between 1896-98 are unclear, but two Augustinian priests, Joaquin Duran and Ulpiano Herrero, testified that the Guardias were employed by Dominicans to subvert the teachings of the Katipunan. A pamphlet in Pampanga issued by Father Zacarias Lizarraga on April 1898 supports this claim, calling upon the Guardias to pray fervently and increase their courage so that Spain might win the war against the United States. Lizarraga, who was also the Director of the Guardia de Honor, enjoined cofrades to oppose the Katipunan, who had been punished by the Church with excommunication. With the revolution in full swing, most clerics were arrested by katipuneros and put to jail by revolutionary provincial leaders. There are claims that, faced with a lack of spiritual guidance, and perhaps spurred on by Dominicans in Manila, abandoned parishioners in Pangasinan rose up in counter-revolt against the Katipunan. However, modern research suggests that there was indication that the Guardias engaged in resistance against the Republic because of these factors. After the terms of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, which enforced a truce between Emilio Aguinaldo and the Spanish colonial government and the former's subsequent exile, members of the cofradia became \\"pseudo-guards\\" and were described as similar to other politico-religious movements such as Gabinistas in Pampanga, the Colorums in San Cristobal, the Babailanes, or even the Katipunan itself. Considered a \\"new form of brigandage\\" by the colonial government, Guardias were persecuted by the Guardia Civil. The Bishop of Vigan, meanwhile, prohibited its religious ceremonies. On August 1897, the governor of Pangasinan noted a marked increase of membership in the society. Guardias were observed to be preparing machetes, particularly in the towns of Calasiao and Urbiztondo, which were famed for their foundries. This was ignored by the governor in order to keep the semblance of peace. By October more reports of unusual preparations from the Guardias circulated in the province, and by February 1898, the \\"fanatics\\" commenced their \\"pillaging\\" throughout Pangasinan, prompting a response from the government. Don Juan Ferrer, relating his eyewitness account, relays that the Guardia de Honor, being a society to venerate the Virgin Mary, prayed to her for guidance in the struggle against the Spanish. Arrested Guardias in December 1898 also testified that their organization was broken up by the Spanish colonial government on account of the Revolution, and that their primer jefe was Aguinaldo himself. =Philippine-American War= From October 1898 to December 1899, the established Revolutionary Government received multiple reports of continuing disorder in the north, particularly in the provinces of Tarlac and Pangasinan. Reports of highwaymen and bandits, variously referred to as agrabiados and discontentos, appearing in the countryside and attacking prominent families and administrative units loyal to the new government were frequent. These disturbances threatened political reorganization as well as plans for the expected conflict with the United States. By December 1898, peace and order in the provinces of La Union, Pangasinan, and Tarlac had deteriorated to a critical point. These attacks followed a pattern of rebels assaulting poorly-defended towns, sacking government buildings, destroying official records, robbing Filipinos of consequence as well as Chinese businessmen. The towns of Bamban and Camiling in particular were targets of a popular uprising on Christmas Day 1898. =Government response= Response in the affected provinces was severe. General Francisco Macabulos, military commander of Pangasinan and Tarlac, blamed disturbances on the \\"friar- instigated Guardia de Honor, who sought nothing but the disturbance of the established order\\". Known Guardias were arrested and tried in military courts while promising amnesty to those who would surrender. He also ordered the disarming of the civilian population lest they also join the movement. A cordon sanitaire was thrown around the province of Tarlac and martial law was declared, hampering Republican efforts to combat the Americans by forcing them to dedicate troops in Tarlac. Efforts to withdraw detachments from Tarlac were futile, with guerillas ready to attack any poblacion left defenseless. The response from the government in Malolos was more cautious. The Secretary of Agriculture, perhaps aware of the religious nature of the unrest, suggested that Gregorio Aglipay be sent to calm the province. Troops were sent to guard only the towns, using a policy of attraction to get the peasants to return to a peaceful life. This approach did not work, and popular unrest in the provinces only grew. Leaders would refer to themselves as \\"Brigadier General\\" and employ a strategy of terror to drain resources and popular support from the government. This, along with urgent letters from General Macabulos, spurred the government to adopt a policy of assassinating the leaders of the popular uprising. Pedro Perdoche, a former corporal in the Guardia Civil and a suspected cabecilla of the Guardia de Honor, was acknowledged as one of the leaders in the Camiling uprising. On January 1899, Tranquilino Paguirigan, Camiling's presidente, and some military officials plotted to have him assassinated. They invited him and his men to a party on the pretext that the local officials of Camiling were ready to join him. Pedroche accepted, and during the merrymaking, he and his men were massacred. This event was publicized around different towns in hopes of quelling the rebellion, but this had no effect. By the end of February 1899, the trouble had become serious enough to be considered a general uprising. The town of San Carlos, Pangasinan, for example, tried to request reinforcements to defend its 23,000 inhabitants against \\"those who call themselves discontented or oppressed and Guards of Honor.\\" =American response= By 1899 the American forces had made a foothold in Central Luzon. General Elwell S. Otis, commander of the \\"pacification\\" forces in the Philippines, grasped neither the military nor social realities of the uprising he faced. Taking from his experience in the Indian Wars, Otis ordered a crackdown on the leaders of the groups. An \\"established redeemer\\" was arrested in Calumpit, Bulacan and jailed for \\"illegal money exactions from the more ignorant natives\\", while General Arthur MacArthur decided to eradicate the Guardia de Honor stronghold in Cabaruan, which he took in an almost bloodless skirmish. The occupation of Cabaruan did not yield any long-term result. Wary of the unusual number of people in Cabaruan, and the seeming quiet, the Americans stationed in Dagupan frequently sent detachments to observe the place. The Americans were concerned about conflicting reports. There were multiple reports that the streets of Cabaruan were clean and perfectly laid out, and none of the town's people were found to be engaged in work. An observer noted that while the townspeople were supposedly organized as \\"some new religion\\", their real objective was \\"extorting money from the public\\". In reality, the residents of Cabaruan were engaged in continual raids into the farms and property of neighboring towns. Patrols from Dagupan frequently heard rumors from nearby towns of chronic criminal activity and sordid rites being committed in Cabaruan, although they could do nothing but perform wary surveillance. Any attempt to visit Cabaruan by surprise resulted in the military patrols being greeted by the Cabaruan brass band, yielding no evidence of their activity. Cabaruan was not the only Guardia de Honor stronghold during this time. Similar events could be found in Tayug, where Guardias were led by Hilario Tumbaga, a \\"Cardinal\\" of the Guardia de Honor. The Americans, after razing Tayug to the ground in an operation, unwittingly allowed Tumbaga, who was known as a healer and a prophet, to establish a new barrio dominated by Guardias. Ramon Estabillo, another Guardia, founded a new town near San Nicolas named Natividad. Both Tumbaga and Estabillo were eventually arrested in 1901 on grounds of extortion and larceny. In Santa Ana, some Guardias led by a lesser prophet settled there after leaving Cabaruan due to disputes regarding food supply. The situation in Cabaruan itself was becoming less tenable. By 1901 the influx of peasants from all over the province left Cabaruan with little food to spare. Attacks on the rich landowning class and poorer tenant farmers increased in an effort to mitigate this crisis. The increase in attacks only served to mobilize American forces against the Guardias. On March 3, 1901, in response to the demands of the Pangasinan principalia, American forces moved to suppress the Guardias in Cabaruan and Santa Ana, leading to the arrests of their leaders. They were executed on June 1, 1901. After this event, the Guardia de Honor disintegrated and began the political reorganization of the province. Organization Although starting out as a confraternity organized by Dominican priests, by the turn of the 20th century the Guardia de Honor was heavily radicalized. Its main leaders were situated in Cabaruan, where adherents were led by a man named Baltazar, who referred to himself as \\"God Almighty\\". Under Baltazar were Antonio Valdez, Gregorio Claveria, and Maria de la Cruz, who were \\"Christ\\", the \\"Holy Ghost\\", and \\"the Virgin Mary\\", respectively. The Guardias were also led by twelve lieutenants who were called the \\"Savior's Apostles\\". At its peak the Guardia de Honor had members throughout most of Pangasinan, Tarlac, and La Union. As a cofradia, the Guardia de Honor was organized by Dominican priests whose purpose was to instill devotion to the Virgin Mary. Its members were mainly women, and was led by a hermana mayor who would organize the sisters in shifts to ensure that at least one of them was praying at any given time of the day.

It is also known as Parklands. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 September 2004.  History  =Indigenous history= Material in rock shelters reveals that Aboriginal people inhabited the surrounding region at least from the last ice age some 20,000 years ago. Several different languages and dialects were spoken in the Sydney Harbour area before the arrival of the First Fleet. \\"Kuringgai\\" was the language spoken on the north shores.DEST & DUAP, 1996, 42, 135, 138 When Europeans chose the south side of the harbour for the settlement of the First Fleet in 1788, they chose the territory of the Darug-speaking people, who inhabited the region from the southern shores of Sydney Harbour west to the Blue Mountains. Both the Darug and the Kuringgai groups suffered catastrophic loss of life in the smallpox epidemic that swept through the indigenous population in 1789, with a death rate estimated to have been between 50 per cent and 90 per cent. Over the following century there were numerous documentary recordings of the movements of surviving Kuringgai people within the Ku-Ring-Gai locality, both attending Aboriginal gatherings and collecting European rations such as blankets. There are also several oral history accounts of small clans travelling through the district in the late nineteenth century. In the 1950s at least a few local Aboriginal people were known to be still living within their traditional territory.Kur-Ring-Gai Historical Society, 1996, 12-13 =Early Europeans in the district= Before the railway (constructed late nineteenth century) and later the Sydney Harbour Bridge (opened 1932) made the north shore easily accessible, the Kur-Ring-Gai area was remote from Sydney Town and consisted mainly of isolated white rural communities earning their livelihood from agricultural activities such as timber-getting and market gardening. Wahroonga first experienced suburban development after the railway line from Hornsby to St Leonards was opened in 1890, when the first suburban roads were constructed followed by the first homes, built around 1896. The Shire of Ku-Ring-Gai was first constituted in 1906 with just six councillors, who took temporary offices in the grounds of St John's Church at Gordon.Kur-Ring-Gai Historical Society, 1996, 12-18 =Evatt House history of land ownership= The property was originally part of granted to John Terry Hughes in 1842. In the 1890s a consortium of businessmen (Smith Burns and Withers) acquired acreage in Wahroonga and sold off lots in Junction Road and Kintore Street that included this land. A small part of the Evatt House site formed part of a larger property facing Kintore Street at the back of Evatt House, known as Grantham, built by Christiana Hordern . The land was further subdivided . In 1937 three blocks were purchased by Clive Raleigh Evatt Snr (1900-1984; LL.B., Q.C., MLA for Hurstville 1939-1959), a prominent NSW Labor politician. With his wife Marjorie (n√©e Marjorie Hannah Andreas, 1903-1984), Clive commissioned architect Stuart Traill to design a Georgian Revival house for the property, built in 1940. Daughters Elizabeth and Penelope remember that their mother was also particularly influential in the design of the house. There is no known landscape designer associated with the property. The decision to retain the native vegetation, rather than plant an English-style garden more typically associated with Georgian residences, was unusual and progressive for its time. 'Bush garden became a fashionable term after the publication of \\"Designing Australian Bush Gardens\\" (1966) by Betty Maloney and Jean Walker. They were not the first, however, to advocate a design approach exclusively using native plants. In the 1920s Walter and Marion Griffin encouraged those who moved into their new subdivision at Castlecrag to plant local species, and Edna Walling, in her book \\"The Australian Roadside\\" (1952), championed the retention of remnant roadside vegetation. Among the first publications to include garden plans featuring only Australian species, was \\"Australina Plants for the Garden\\" (1953) by Thistle Harris.'Aitken & Looker, 2002, 119 'Recognition of the indigenous flora and its use in the vernacular, decorative and applied arts was characteristic of the federation period between 1890 and 1914, when Australia was searching for symbols of its new identity and independence. Strangely, all this artistic representation of Australia's native flora was not matched by interest in using it as a horticultural subject. It was another fifty years or so before the next wave of attention brought native plants into Australian suburban gardens in great numbers.'Crone, 2001, 76, 92 =The Evatt family and associates= Ken Cable's biographical sketch on Clive Raleigh Evatt explains that he was born in Maitland in 1900, the younger brother of the famous Labor politician and jurist, Herbert Vere Evatt (also known as H. V. Evatt or Doc Evatt). Clive's career was distinguished although 'it lacked the extraordinary achievement of his brother's'. After education at Fort Street Boys High, he entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon and graduated with a King's Medal in 1921. He enrolled in the Law Faculty at Sydney University and was a Kings Counsel barrister by 1935. In 1939 Clive Evatt was elected to NSW Parliament as Labor MP for Hurstville and his party led by W.J. McKell won the election in 1941. Evatt served as NSW Minister for Education,Cable, 2002 where he tried to introduce unpopular reforms such as banning corporal punishment in schools,Godfrey, 1989 but was more effective as Minister for Housing in the early years of large-scale public housing. Evatt was highly intelligent, personable and witty. An effective speaker, he nevertheless did not conform to the traditional Labor type. He was essentially a middle-class Protestant radical, as was his brother. The postwar years were a time of unease and tension for Evatt. He rapidly lost seniority in Cabinet, taking \\"bread and butter\\" portfolios. He left the Ministry of J. J. Cahill in 1954 and quit Parliament in 1959. Already he had returned to the bar, specialising with great success, in libel and personal injury cases. While inevitably living in the shadow of his famous brother, whom he held in great esteem, Clive Evatt was a man of talent and significance in his own right. Cable remarks that with his qualifications and connections, Clive Raleigh Evatt was representative of a new generation of non-union, liberally minded men who stressed the need for Labor to appeal to a broad electorate. 'A patron of the Arts, he entertained widely in his Wahroonga home'NBRS, 2003, 12 which was frequented by significant artistic, academic, legal and Labor figures. John Gordon writes: 'Evatt, a colourful King's Counsel, a graduate of Duntroon Military Academy and younger brother of H. V. Evatt, showed himself to be a humanitarian reformer with a highly personalised style. Evatt was before his time anticipating the spirit of the early 1970s.'Godfrey, 1989, 120, 123 Famous people associated with the household included Clive's brother H. V. Evatt, artist Sidney Nolan, actors Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh and numerous musicians and artists patronised by the Evatts. Michael Bogle notes that in the early 1950s as Minister for Housing, Clive Evatt overturned Willoughby Council's rejection of Seidler's design for Meller House in Castlecrag, authorising its construction as a demonstration home.Bogle, 1993 Seidler has described his first visit to 69 Junction Road in 1950 as \\"momentous\\" and cites Evatt's support as persuasive in his decision to remain and work in Australia.Seidler, 2003 This was some years before he married Evatt's youngest daughter, Pennelope. Nonetheless Harry Seidler's outstanding career was supported by the social connections forged through this prominent family, and initially at least, within this house. Furthermore, the Evatt children who grew up in Evatt House are likely to be considered historically significant in their own right: Elizabeth Evatt, first woman Chief Justice of the Family Court; Penelope Seidler, an architect who married the noted architect, Harry Seidler in 1958; and Clive Evatt, well known as a Sydney art dealer. The prominent careers of all three siblings evidence a continuation and extension of the family's interests in the law and the arts within NSW. The ownership of the property was passed to grown up off-spring of Clive and Marjorie Evatt in 1970, although both parents continued to live in the house until their deaths, a few months apart, in 1984. The house was sold out of the Evatt family by 1986. Minor alterations and renovations were carried out included installation of the clay tennis court on the western blockSeidler, 2004; Earthscape, 2003, 4 and modifications to the semi-circular driveway and garaging on the eastern block.  Description  The house is a palatial Georgian Revival residence in the Ku-ring-gai area, designed by architect Stuart Traill and built in 1940. The original gardens were probably laid out in the 1940s following the construction of the dwelling. The installation of the clay tennis court on the western block are believed to have been undertaken after the property was sold out of the Evatt family in 1986. Also dated to this time are modifications to the semi-circular driveway and garaging on the eastern block. The site contains approximately one hundred trees of predominantly locally indigenous native species, some of which may have existed prior to European settlement of the area. There are a number of mature Angophora costata (Sydney red gums) and Syncarpia glomulifera (Turpentines) as well as other locally indigenous tree species including Eucalyptus pilularis (Blackbutt), Eucalyptus globoidea (White stringybark) and Eucalyptus resinifera (Red Mahogany). These are located randomly through the site and are unlikely to have been planted. These species are all locally indigenous and are representative of the original flora or the locality (for this soil type and aspect). Whilst some of the larger trees within the site may have existed prior to European settlement of the area and have some heritage significance for that reason, most appear to be relatively young trees in the order of 40 to 80 years old. These trees have probably regenerated since land was originally cleared. There is no remaining native understorey within the site.Earthworks, 2003, 4 Two Monterey Pines c.1920s, may have been planted before the site was subdivided. This property should also be associated with the \\"Clive Evatt Reserve\\", owned and managed by Ku- Ring-Gai Council, and located about five blocks from Evatt House on the corner of Eastern Road and Burns Road. The house and gardens are both largely intact but have deteriorated somewhat in recent years. The Heritage Office has refused a recent application to remove about half the trees on the site.  Heritage listing  As at 25 August 2004, Evatt House is of state significance on the basis of its historical associations with the prominent NSW Labor politician that consolidated the land, built the house and lived there for nearly half a century (1940-1986), Clive Raleigh Evatt. The Evatt children who grew up in this house are likely to be considered historically significant in their own right: Elizabeth Evatt, first Chief Justice of the Family Court; architect Penelope Seidler; and Clive Evatt Jnr, a noted Sydney art dealer. A patron of the arts, Clive R. Evatt entertained widely and the home was frequented by significant artistic, academic, legal and Labor figures. In 1950 as State Minister for Housing, Evatt intervened on behalf of the pioneering modernist architect Harry Seidler to allow the construction of Mellor House in Castlecrag. Seidler describes his first visit to Evatt House in 1950 as \\"momentous\\" and cites Evatt's support as persuasive in his decision to remain and work in Australia.Seidler eventually married Evatt's daughter Penelope in 1958 The property is otherwise likely to be of local significance as a good example of a substantial Georgian Revival residence in the Ku-ring-gai area, designed by Stuart Traill, and still largely intact. The \\"bush garden\\" setting for Evatt House is also of significance for its early attempt to maintain the ambience of indigenous Australian vegetation within suburbia. When the bushland vegetation is seen in combination with the Georgian revival style of the house, the place clearly demonstrates the fostering of Australian cultural nationalism in the mid-twentieth century by the Evatt family. Evatt House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The bush garden setting for Evatt House is of significance as an early attempt to maintain an ambience of \\"native bushland\\" in Australian suburbia. The identification of Australian flora with the fostering of national identity is typical of progressive Australian cultural life.Crone, 2001 The house is representative of C.R. Evatt as a new type of Labor politician who focused less upon working class values than upon the possibilities for social betterment, nationalist cultural development and human rights. The property is of local significance as an example of a substantial upper middle class residence set within landscaped gardens that typified the suburban development of Wahroonga in the mid-twentieth century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Evatt House is of State significance on the basis of its historical associations with the prominent family that consolidated the land, built the house and lived there over nearly half a century (1940-1986): Clive Raleigh Evatt and his wife Marjorie, and their children, Clive Evatt Jnr (a barrister and art dealer), Elizabeth Evatt (first woman Chief Justice of the Family Court) and Penelope Seidler (architect who married the internationally noted architect, Harry Seidler). Evatt House is of significance in so far as its first owner, Clive Evatt, with his qualifications and connections was representative of a new generation of non-union, liberally minded Labor politicians who stressed the need for Labor to appeal to a broad electorate. A patron of the arts, Evatt entertained widely and his home was frequented by significant artistic, academic, legal and Labor figures. Twentieth century neo-Georgian architecture had been associated with progressive or modernist architecture in Australian and Britain in the early twentieth century in its attempt to avoid eclecticism, although it later became synonymous with \\"upper middle class concepts of good taste\\" However Apperley et al. also point to the nationalist significance of the style as the first conscious architectural movement within Australia to revive the early Australian idiom of \\"Old Colonial Georgian\\", as popularised by William Hardy Wilson during the inter- war period.Apperley et al, 1989, 150 The fostering of the bush garden in association with a neo-Georgian styled house can be seen to be part of the Evatt's progressive, modernist patronage of Australian culture. Famous people associated with the household included visitors such as Clive's brother \\"Doc\\" Evatt (a Federal Labor politician and the first Secretary-General of the then newly formed United Nations), artist Sidney Nolan, actors Lawrence Olivier and Vivien Leigh and numerous musicians and artists patronised by the Evatts. The family's art collection included works by Australian modernists Donald Friend, Adrian Feint and Margaret Preston. In 1950 as State Minister for Housing, Evatt intervened on behalf of the pioneering modernist architect Harry Seidler to allow the construction of Mellor House in Castlecrag. Seidler describes his first visit to Evatt House in 1950 as \\"momentous\\" and cites Evatt's support as persuasive in his decision to remain and work in Australia. Parklands is thus strongly associated with twentieth century Australian modernist cultural practitioners as well as a prominent Australian political family. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Evatt House is of local significance as a good example of a substantial Georgian Revival residence in the Ku-ring-gai area, still largely intact and sited impressively on a large block of land with mature stands of trees providing a stately setting for the house.Tropman & Tropman, 2003 It was designed by Stuart Traill and is considered to be in the Interwar Georgian Revival style.Apperly et al, 1989, 150 The house design is also of interest for the contributions from Evatt's wife Marjorie, his father-in-law E.P. Andreas and his sister-in-law Mary Alice Evatt (n√©e Sheffer, who had studied architecture). Unusually for the late 1930s, the Evatts did not clear the grounds and design an English-style garden, but kept the indigenous trees, and planted some exotic species around the site. Although no known landscape designer is associated with the property, the garden is of significance as an early example of a \\"bush garden\\" in Sydney suburbia. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Evatt House is of significance in so far as its first owner, Clive Evatt, with his qualifications and connections was representative of a new generation of non-union, liberally minded Labor politicians who stressed the need for Labor to appeal to a broad electorate. A patron of the arts, Evatt entertained widely and his home was frequented by significant artistic, academic, legal and Labor figures. Twentieth century neo-Georgian architecture had been associated with progressive or modernist architecture in Australian and Britain in the early twentieth century in its attempt to avoid eclecticism, although it later became synonymous with \\"upper middle class concepts of good taste\\". However Apperley et al. also point to the nationalist significance of the style as the first conscious architectural movement within Australia to revive an early Australian idiom. The fostering of the bush garden in association with a neo-Georgian styled house can be seen to be part of the Evatt's progressive, modernist patronage of Australian culture. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Nil. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Comparative analyses of the house with other Georgian Revival residences in Ku-Ring-Gai suggest that Evatt House is not a rare example of the genre. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Nil.

His most important works include a manifesto entitled, \\"Der Dichter greift in die Politik\\" (\\"The poet engages in politics\\", 1912) and a stage-drama, \\"Die Gewaltlosen\\" (\\"Men of non-violence\\", 1919), which he dedicated to \\"dem Kameraden, meiner Frau Frida\\" (loosely, \\"My comrade wife Frida\\"). His \\"Kriminalsonetten\\" have even led to his being seen by some as a prophet of Dadaism. Sources may also identify him by his literary pseudonym as Ernst Ludwig Grombeck.  Biography  = Provenance and early years = Ludwig Rubiner was born in Berlin. Wilhelm Rubiner, his father, was a journalist and popular novelist who had migrated from Galicia, which at that time was a crown land of Austria-Hungary. His mother's name is not known. Although his family provenance was Ashkenazi Jewish, Ludwig Rubiner attended a Protestant secondary school in Berlin. Then, on 10 October 1902, he enrolled at Berlin University to study Medicine. After a term he switched to the Philosophy faculty, where he remained a student till 1906, studying Music, Art History, Philosophy and Literature. During his university years he was a member of the \\"Berliner Freien Studentenschaft\\", participating in the organisation's literary activities, delivering lectures on radical authors such as Tolstoy, Strindberg and Wedekind while also involving himself in theatrical productions. Impatient with the \\"petty bourgeois\\" manifestations of university life, Rubiner found himself drawn towards Berlin's avant-garde society. He developed as taste for mysticism and the anarchist philosophy associated with Max Stirner. In the circles in which he mixed Friedrich Nietzsche was hugely fashionable at this time, but Rubiner was content to dismiss Nietzsche's world-view as \\"nur farbige Sentimentalit√§t\\" (\\"flowery sentimentality\\"), while Stirner's 1845 book, \\"The Ego and Its Own\\" he eulogised as \\"dem bedeutendste Manifest des Jahrhunderts\\" (\\"the most significant manifesto of the [nineteenth] century\\"). Several of the radical intellectuals whom Rubiner got to know during this period went on to become important expressionist writers. These included Erich M√ºhsam, Paul Scheerbart, Ren√© Schickele, Ferdinand Hardekopf, Wilhelm Herzog and Herwarth Walden. It was his friendship with Walden that made possible the launch of Rubiner's own literary career. = Early work = His first poem, \\"Zu den H√∂hen\\", appeared in 1904 in the anarchist news magazine, Der Kampf. In 1905 he was contributing to the literary monthly Charon, still writing \\"lyrical\\" texts. In 1906, like his father before him, he embarked in a career as a newspaperman, working as a critic and providing glosses, theatre reviews and poems in a number of journals cith names such as \\"Die Gegenwart\\", \\"Morgen\\", \\"Der Demokrat\\", \\"Das Theater\\", \\"Der Sturm\\" and \\"Pan\\". Till 1914 he was seen as a major figure among the young Berlin \\"Bohemians\\" around Franz Pfemfert (1879‚Äì1954), editor of Die Aktion, to which Rubiner was also a regular contributor. =The critic= Many of Rubiners pieces were constructed as relatively short essay: in them he dealt with literary themes or personalities. There were essays about novelists, composers and artists as well as reviews of individual pieces of new literature or music, and of art exhibitions. When it came to literature, those whose works he most frequently scrutinised for the benefit of his own readers included Else Lasker-Sch√ºler, Max Brod, Ernst Bla√ü, Arthur Holitscher, Peter Hille and Heinrich Mann. Musicians about whom he wrote included Claude Debussy, Hans Pfitzner, Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Richard Strauss, Ferruccio Busoni und Giacomo Puccini. Among artists, representatives of the Berlin Secession featured regularly, along with Henri Rousseau and Henri Matisse. = The lyricist and traveller = In 1906 Rubiner wrote a libretto for the opera \\"Der Nachtw√§chter\\" by his friend Herwarth Walden and tried - apparently without success - to interest Gustav Mahler in the work. Lubiner's collaborations with Walden continued till 1910. That year they wrote together an introduction to Puccini's Madama Butterfly for the \\"Schlesinger'schen Opernf√ºhrer\\" (opera guide). By this time Rubiner was acquiring a taste for foreign travel. He spent the first half of 1908 in Italy, undertaking a coastal walking tour that covered Chiavari, La Spezia and Pisa during April, and ending up in Florence, where he spent three months. By mid-August that year he was staying in Rome, from where he wrote a letter to his cousin, Siegfried Nacht. Travelling back to Germany he stopped off at a sanatorium for a brief cure at Feldberg in der Mark (indicating that he was already suffering from tuberculosis), but he was nevertheless back in Berlin by the end of August. Two months later he visited Weimar, which had been something of a secular pilgrimage destination for the culturally committed ever since the days of Goethe. The next year he undertook a lengthy stay in Russia. Visits to Austria and Switzerland followed. He based himself, for a brief period during 1912/1913, in Paris. = The translator = From the moment he embarked on his career as a literary critic Rubiner took an interest in foreign-language literature, especially in French and in Russian: he knew both languages well. In 1907 he produced an essay on Joris-Karl Huysmans and in 1909 one on Fyodor Sologub which was published in \\"Die Gegenwart\\". He also translated three of Sologub's substantial poems into German: his translations of \\"Zwei Herrscher\\" (\\"Two lords\\") and of \\"Die Phantasie\\" both appeared in \\"Die Gegenwart\\". His translation of \\"Der Scharfrichter von N√ºrnberg\\" (\\"The executioner of Nuremberg\\") was published in \\"Die Schaub√ºhne\\". That same year his translation of Verlaine's short story, \\"Mme. Aubin\\" was published in \\"Das Theater\\". In 1910 his essay on the francophone Belgian author Fernand Crommelynck appeared in \\"Der Demokrat\\". He also translated another Sologub poem, \\"Der Traum\\" (\\"The Dream\\"). Other significant translations included that, in 1908, of Mikhail Kuzmin's novel \\"Deeds of the Great Alexcander\\" and Nikolai Gogol's volume Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka. This translation was a joint project with Frida Ickak, another scholar of literature and part-time professional translator, whom he had met in 1908. They married towards the end of 1911 while on a visit to London. = Paris = In 1910, using the pseudonym Ernst Ludwig Grombeck, he published \\"Die indischen Opale\\" (\\"The Indian Opal\\"), described in sources as a \\"Criminial Novel\\" (or, more loosely, a work of police/detective fiction). He worked closely with Franz Pfemfert on Pfemfert's magazine, Die Aktion, between 1911 and 1918. In November 1912 he relocated to Paris where he lived with the critic-journalist Carl Einstein in a small hotel near Saint-Sulpice, along the Rue de Veaugirard. Fellow writer Max Cah√©n reported later that the two of them \\"described themselves as the 'Klub der Neupythagor√§er' (\\"Neopythagoreanist Club\\").Der Weg nach Versailles : Erinnerungen 1912 - 1919. Schicksalsepoche einer Generation. Boppard : Boldt, 1963, pages 16-17 Invoking Neopythagoreanism in this way highlights Einstein's and Rubiner's attachment at the time to mystical Kabbalah. In Paris Rubiner operated as a literary intermediary between German and French literature. He provided regular articles to German publications such as \\"Die Schaub√ºhne\\", M√§rz and Die Aktion over the most significant cultural developments in the French capital of the moment, many of which he could report directly from his own regular visits to the Caf√© du D√¥me in Montparnasse, close to his home. The Caf√© had become a popular meeting point for German artists and intellectuals who had established connections with modern France.Emil Szittya: Das Kuriosit√§ten-Kabinett. See- Verlag, Konstanz 1923, page 106 At the \\"Fleury\\" artists' colony which had been set up by the expatriate Dutch artist Kees van Dongen, Rubiner had the opportunity to meet up with leading Paris-based artists such as Otto van Rees, Blaise Cendrars and Otto Freundlich. He formed a particularly close friendship with Marc Chagall whose pictures were included in Herwarth Walden's first Autumn Exhibition of German Artists, held in Berlin at the Sturm Gallery in 1912. Of particular interest to scholars is the extensive correspondence that the two men sustained after they were both obliged to leave Paris, following the outbreak of war. Later, when Walden failed to pay for the paintings that Chagall had exhibited at his Berlin gallery, Rubiner intervened with Walden on Chagall's behalf. It is not entirely clear whether his intervention was successful. Rubiner spent time in Berlin during the early part of 1913: it is not possible to be sure in which of the two capitals he was living over the next couple of years. In May 1914 he sent a report on a \\"Neue Sezession\\" exhibition from Paris to Die Aktion. However, at the end of 1914 he started working for \\"Die Wei√üen Bl√§tter\\" which at that stage was still based in Germany (published in Leipzig), and to which he contributed an essay entitled \\"Homer und Monte Christo\\". He also wrote the \\"pantomime\\" for the silent movie, \\"Der Aufstand\\" (\\"The Insurrection\\") which is included in Das Kinobuch the movie compilation produced by Kurt Pinthus.\\" Rubiner was probably still resident in Paris during the summer of 1914 and, it is implied by some sources, during the first part of 1915. War broke out towards the end of July 1914, and in 1914 or 1915 Ludwig Rubiner, who made no secret of his passionate opposition to the war, and his wife emigrated voluntarily to Switzerland. Here he wrote for the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung and also, during 1917/18, published \\"Zeit-Echo\\", a pacifist news magazine produced primarily for Switzerland's international community of exiles. In addition to producing \\"Zeit-Echo\\", Ludwig Rubiner wrote most of it. = The social critic = In 1912 Ludwig Rubiner renounced literary criticism and committed himself to concentrating on social criticism. In Paris published a literary-political manifesto \\"Der Dichter greift in die Politik\\" (loosely \\"The poet engages in politics\\"), which was appeared later that same year in the pages of Die Aktion. In 1913 he published \\"Die Kriminalsonette\\" which he had co-written with the American businessman, Livingstone Hahn and Friedrich Eisenlohr, a fellow contributor to Die Aktion. He translated and wrote an introduction to an adventure novel by Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq, a writer who as a young man lived through the French Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath. The translation was published in 1920.M√©moires de Vidocq, chef de la police de S√ªret√©, jusqu‚Äôen 1827. Deutsche √úbersetzung von Ludwig Rubiner aus dem Jahr 1920: Landstreicherleben. = Z√ºrich = For their voluntary Swiss exile the Rubiners settled at Hadlaubstra√üe 11, near the centre of Z√ºrich. Rubiner now became a central figure in a group of exiled French and Russian pacifist intellectuals such as Romain Rolland, Henri Guilbeaux and Anatoly Lunacharsky. The creation of \\"Zeit-Echo\\", a pacifist quarterly of which four copies were produced during 1917, was an important project, but Rubiner also succeeded in maintaining close contacts with Die Aktion und Die Wei√üen Bl√§tter in Berlin and Leipzig: production of the latter publication moved to Z√ºrich during 1916. That year Rubiner published his poetry collection \\"Das himmlische Licht\\" (\\"The heavenly light\\") in \\"Die Wei√üen Bl√§tter\\", following up with a book version of the same collection. In the same year he published his \\"manifesto\\", \\"Die √Ñnderung der Welt\\" (loosely, \\"Changing the world\\") in the magazine \\"Das Ziel\\". 1917 was a particularly productive year for Ludwig Rubiner. He produced \\"Zeit-Echo\\" while contributing energetically to the world of literary criticism more widely. Under the title \\"Revolutionstage in Ru√üland\\" (\\"Days of Revolution in Russia\\") he used \\"Zeit-Echo\\" to publish German translations of a large number of letters that Leo Tolstoy had written to his closest friends about the unfolding events of the Russian Revolution, of which Rubiner was a keen supporter. Something else that appeared in \\"Zeit-Echo\\" was Tolstoy's \\"Der Fremde und der Bauer\\" (\\"The stranger and the peasant\\"), a dialogue translated by Frida Rubiner. He also used \\"Die Aktion\\" to publish the programmatic piece \\"Der Kampf mit dem Engel\\" (\\"The fight with the angel\\") in \\"Das Aktionbuch: f√ºnf Gedichte Zurufe an die Freunde\\", the collection produced by Pfemfert. Finally, that year, came \\"Der Mensch in der Mitte\\" (\\"The man [-/person] in the middle\\"), an anthology in which Rubiner collected together various previously published essays. In 1918 Rubiner published a translation of Tolstoy's diaries, on which he had worked with his wife, and to which he appended a lengthy introduction of his own. He also published another \\"manifesto\\", \\"Die Erneuerung\\" (\\"The renewal\\") in the news magazine \\"Das Forum\\". That year the war ended. In neutral Switzerland, Ludwig Rubiner's enthusiasm for the Russian Revolution had not impressed the authorities. There are suggestions that during 1918 the Swiss were coming under increasing pressure from the German General Staff in respect of the Communist activist Frida Rubiner and her anarchist-poet husband. The Russian revolution alarmed governments across Europe: according to one source a report by the German General Staff concluded that \\"the circle around the Rubiners in Z√ºrich can be seen as the headquarters of the international revolution\\" (\\"Als Zentrale der internationalen Revolution kann erachtet werden der Kreis um Rubiner in Z√ºrich\\"). The Rubiners were aware of coming under intensified surveillance both by the Swiss authorities and by representatives of the German embassy. They were \\"spied upon\\" and their Z√ºrich apartment was searched: it is not clear by whom, nor what the intruders were searching for: they appear not to have found it. Ferruccio Busoni, one of the Rubiner's closest friends during their Swiss exile, wrote a letter to his agent, Albert Biolley, in which he confided that he had himself been \\"left behind in Zurich\\" and that his friend Rubiner had left suddenly, without being able to explain why. Either way, the Rubiners became aware that they needed to leave Switzerland. Some sources link this with the expulsion of the Soviet embassy from Bern at about the same time, while others state baldly that in December 1918 they were expelled from the country. On 24 December 1918, thanks to his family's Galician provenance, Ludwig Rubiner was issued with an Austrian passport by Austrian consular authorities who appear still to have been present in Z√ºrich. On 30 January 1919 he left Switzerland and headed for Berlin, travelling via Munich. His wife's involvement in the revolutionary events the took place in Munich during the first half of 1919 vindicate official suspicions at the time that Frida Rubiner, for one, was among those actively working for a soviet style revolution in Germany. = Back in Berlin = While his wife remained politically engaged in Munich, Ludwig Rubiner returned home to Berlin where he moved into the apartment of his friend, the musician Ferruccio Busoni, who was undertaking a succession of postwar concert tours across Europe's cultural capitals.Dent, Edward J. (1933). Ferruccio Busoni: A Biography, London: Oxford University Press. (Reprint: London: Ernst Eulenberg, 1974) , pages 240-247 Rubiner took a job as an editor with the Kiepenhauer publishing house in Potsdam. He published, for a second time, his anthology \\"Der Mensch in der Mitte\\" (\\"The man [-/person] in the middle\\"), followed by two further anthologies: \\"Kameraden der Menschheit: Dichtungen zur Weltrevolution\\" (\\"Comrades of humanity: Poems on World Revolution\\") and \\"Die Gemeinschaft. Dokumente der geistigen Weltwende\\" (\\"Community: Documents of the Global Spiritual Change\\"). He published the stage-drama that he had written while in Switzerland during 1917 and 1918: \\"Die Gewaltlosen\\" (\\"Men of non- violence\\"). The stage drama was included in the Kiepenhauer series of new theatrical pieces. This was also the year in which he published his essay \\"Die kulturelle Stellung des Schauspielers\\" (\\"The cultural standing of the stage- actor\\") in the theatre journal, \\"Freie Deutsche B√ºhne\\". Early in 1919 Rubiner teamed up with the politically like-minded writers Arthur Holitscher, Rudolf Leonhard, Franz Jung und Alfons Goldschmidt to set up the Bund Proletarischer Kultur (\\"League for Proletarian Culture\\"). It sought to promote \\"the eternal values bequeathed by the illustrious spirits of the past.\\"Sheppard, Richard. 2000. Modernism-Dada-Postmodernism. Avant-Garde & Modernism Studies ser. Evanston, Ill: Northwestern UP. , page 261 The league was consciously modelled on the Russian Proletkult movement inspired by Alexander Bogdanov. At least one source states that by this time Rubiner had probably joined the recently launched Communist Party of Germany (KPD). It sought to introduce proletarian culture to support the struggle of the revolutionary masses for liberation from the bourgeois economic and educational monopoly. It operated outside the Communist Party, however and was more aligned with the Communist Workers Party of Germany. The league also founded a short-lived proletarian theatre, intended to provide proletarian culture for the public. Performances were to take place in factories and other industrial locations. A performance of \\"Freedom\\" by Herbert Kranz took place on 14 December 1919. However, the league broke up as a result of \\"differences of opinion\\" during 1920 before it had been possible to stage Rubiner's own drama \\"Die Gewaltlosen\\" (\\"Men of non- violence\\"). Ludwig Rubiner spent the final months of his life working on translating the novels and stories of Voltaire into German. One year earlier he had published in \\"Die Wei√üen Bl√§tter\\" a substantial article on \\"Voltaire the poet\\" (\\"Der Dichter Voltaire\\") and this was now recycled as a foreword for the first volume of translated works which he published shortly before his death. = Death = Ludwig Rubiner died after six weeks in a Berlin clinic overnight on 27/28 February 1920 as the result of pneumonia. A few days before he had been presented with an award by \\"Das junge Deutschland Gesellschaft\\" (\\"The Young Germany Society\\") in celebration of his literary activities. At his funeral, which took place on 3 March 1920, funeral orations were delivered by Franz Pfemfert and Felix Holl√§nder.

Paterson Factory Complex was a factory located at 126 East 3rd Street in Flint, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The building was demolished in 1996. History William A. Paterson was born on October 3, 1838 in Fergus, Ontario. He apprenticed with the carriage blacksmith firm of Scott and Watson in Guelph, Ontario then moved to Vermont and Massachusetts, where he and worked producing Concord Wagons and Wells-Fargo stagecoaches. He soon struck out on his own, working in multiple places in the 1860s before finally making his way to the City of Flint in 1869. There, he opened a wagon repair shop, and soon expanded into producing his own vehicles. By the 1880s, Paterson's firm employed ten people, and could build one buggy and one cart per day. By the mid-1880s, Paterson had the means to begin construction of a large-scale factory building. He constructed the first part of this building on the corner of Third and Harrison Streets; upon completion, he was the largest manufacturer of vehicles in the area. In 1885, William C. Durant and J. Dallas Dort approached Paterson with a proposition to produce road carts, and soon Paterson had contracts to produce over 10,000 carts. He immediately expanded his operation, expanding into an adjacent building in 1885 and constructing an additional building in 1887. Paterson and Durant-Dort soon parted ways, but Paterson continued to prosper and slowly expand. After an 1894 fire, Paterson rebuilt and further expanded his plant. He added another building in 1895-97, and an addition to the original building in 1898. By 1901, Paterson's company employed 350 people and produced over 23,000 vehicles a year. The firm added another building in 1905. In 1908, Paterson entered the world of automobiles by manufacturing the Paterson Auto Buggy. Paterson automobiles continued to be manufactured in to the 1920s. William A. Paterson, however, died of pneumonia in 1921. His son, William S. Paterson, took over the business, but by that time automobile manufacturers were consolidating, the Paterson's company was too small to survive. The firm was sold in 1923, but the new owners dropped the Paterson line of cars. In 1926, the factory was sold, with plans to convert it into apartments. In 1928, it became the original home of the Flint Institute of Arts. The first floor was occupied for years by a wallpaper and paint firm. Other tenants included Baker Business College, a Social Security office, the Internal Revenue Service, and a variety of commercial and industrial firms. However, in 1996, the rear wall of the building collapsed, rendering it unsafe; the building was razed and turned into a parking lot. A small historical marker, constructed with salvaged bricks, commemorates the site. Description The William A. Paterson Factory Complex consisted of four major buildings occupying approximately one-third of a city block. The oldest building was a single story brick and wood shed, probably built in the late 1870s or early 1880s. The next two were a three-story brick building constructed between 1885 and 1887, and a second three-story, L-shaped building constructed between 1895 and 1897. The facades of these two buildings had balanced window placements between heavy brick piers. The fourth building was constructed in 1905, at the time Paterson transited from manufacturing carts and buggies to manufacturing automobiles. This building was a five-story structure clad with paving brick. It had a balanced window placement and a stepped brick cornice-line.

After winning two minor races as a juvenile developed into a high-class stayer in 1992, recording wins in the Lingfield Derby Trial and Prix Royal-Oak. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1993 when he won the Yorkshire Cup, Doncaster Cup and Prix du Cadran. He suffered from training problems thereafter but recorded another big win when he took the St Leger Italiano in 1995. After his retirement from racing he became a successful sire of National Hunt horses. Background Assessor was a bay horse bred in Ireland by the County Kildare-based Airlie Stud. The colt was acquired by Bjorn Nielsen and entered training with Richard Hannon at East Everleigh in Wiltshire. He was sired by the American-bred stallion Niniski, who won the Irish St. Leger and the Prix Royal-Oak in 1979 before going on to sire many good staying horses including Petoski, Minster Son and Hernando. Assessor's dam Dingle Bay was an unraced, Irish-bred daughter of Petingo. She was a granddaughter of B Flat (foaled 1958) whose other descendants included Bachir, Pitcairn and Rafha. Racing career =1991: two-year-old season= Assessor began his racecourse career in a maiden race over seven furlongs on good to soft ground at Kempton Park on 7 August in which he was ridden by the apprentice jockey Richard Perham and won by three and a half lengths from Flight Lieutenant. He was ridden his four subsequent races that year by John Reid. Before the end of the month the colt had been moved up in class to finish second to Rodrigo de Triano in the Washington Singer Stakes and then run second to Twist and Turn in a Graduation Stakes at Sandown Park. In the Mornington Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 27 September Assessor recorded his second victory as he came home four lengths clear of Bobzao (later to win the Hardwicke Stakes). The colt ended his season in the Group 1 Racing Post Trophy over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse in which he ran third behind Seattle Rhyme and Mack The Knife. =1992: three-year-old season= Walter Swinburn rode Assessor in his first three runs as a three-year-old. On his seasonal debut he contested the Thresher Classic Trial over ten furlongs at Sandown in which he finished third behind Pollen Count and Aljadeer. The Maxims Club Derby Trial Stakes over one and a half miles at Lingfield Park on 9 May saw the colt start the 9/4 favourite against six opponents. After being pushed along in the early stages he went to the front three furlongs out and drew well clear to win \\"comfortably\\" by seven lengths from Tapis Rouge, with two and a half lengths back to Bonny Scot in third place. Assessor's win at Lingfield established him as a contender for the 1992 Epsom Derby and on 2 June he started the 9/1 joint third favourite in an eighteen-runner field for the 213th running of the race. He was never in contention and ran poorly, coming home thirteenth in a race which saw Dr Devious win from St Jovite. After a break of two and a half months Assessor was ridden by Reid when he finished third to Bonny Scot in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York and then ran sixth behind the filly User Friendly in the St Leger at Doncaster. On 3 October the colt was sent to France to contest the Group 3 Prix de Lut√®ce over 3000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was partnered by Richard Quinn and finished third behind Dadarissime and Jamshid, having led the race until the last 200 metres. Three week later he returned to Longchamp for the Group 1 Prix Royal-Oak over 3100 metres on soft ground, a race which saw him matched against older horses for the first time. He was re-opposed by Dadarissime and Jamshid while his other eight opponents included Sought Out (Prix du Cadran), Ivyanna (Oaks d'Italia), Justice (Prix Hubert de Chaudenay), Dariyoun (Gran Premio de Madrid), Always Friendly (Princess Royal Stakes) and Witness Box (Northumberland Plate). After being retrained by Quinn in the early stages he began to make steady progress and turned into the straight in second place behind Always Frendly. Assessor overtook the filly 300 metres from the finish and won by two and a half lengths with six lengths back to Sought Out in third. =1993: four-year-old season= Assessor began his third season in April 1993 when he finished fourth to Linpac West in the John Porter Stakes Newbury and second to Roll A Dollar when favourite for the Sagaro Stakes at Ascot. On 13 May at York the colt was ridden by Quinn in the Yorkshire Cup over fourteen furlongs and started at odds of 9/1 in an eight-runner field. The Premio Roma winner Spring started favourite while the other runners included Mashaallah, Sapience (Princess of Wales's Stakes), Roll A Dollar and Shambo (Geoffrey Freer Stakes). Assessor raced close to the leaders from the start, took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by a length from Allegan. After running third in the Henry II Stakes at Sandown, Assessor contested the Gold Cup over two and a half miles at Ascot in June. He took the lead in the straight but was overtaken and beaten into second by the seven- year-old Drum Taps, with Turgeon, Sought Out, Arcadian Heights, Vintage Crop and Further Flight finishing behind. He finished runner-up on his next two starts, beaten by Sonus in the Goodwood Cup and Azzilfi in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. In the Doncaster Cup over two and a quarter miles on soft ground at Doncaster on 9 September the colt carried top weight of 133 pound and started the 5/4 favourite ahead of Further Flight and Witness Box. Quinn retrained Assessor at the rear of the five-runner field before sending him into the lead in the straight and drawing away to win by four lengths. Nine days after his win at Doncaster Assessor contested the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh Racecourse and ran second to Vintage Crop, with Sonus, Drum Taps and Snurge in fourth, fifth and sixth. On 2 October the colt was sent to France for the Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp and started the 6/5 favourite ahead of ten opponents including Sonus, Turgeon, Oh So Risky (Triumph Hurdle, Prix Gladiateur), Dajraan (Prix Chaudenay) and Sought Out. Ridden by Reid, Assessor turned into the straight in fourth place, went to the front 300 metres from the finish, and pulled clear to win \\"easily\\" by six lengths. On his last run of the year Assessor attempted to repeat his 1992 success in the Prix Royal Oak but finished fifth to Raintrap after being badly hampered approaching the straight. Shortly before his final appearance of the season Assessor had been acquired by the Saudi Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabeer. =Later career= Assessor was off the track for almost two years before returning for the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket Racecourse in September 1995 and finishing second to Further Flight. After coming home fifth to Sunshack in the Prix Royal Oak he was sent to Italy for the St Leger Italiano over 2900 metres at Turin of 1 November. With Richard Hughes in the saddle he took the lead in the straight and won \\"easily\\" by almost three lengths from Puerto Escondido. Assessor remained in training as a seven-year-old in 1996 but failed to win in six starts. He finished second to Further Flight in a race at Nottingham, fourth to Double Eclipse in the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier and second to Double Trigger in the Henry II Stakes. Despite his promising early form he finished last in his three subsequent races, namely the Ascot Gold Cup, Prix Kegorlay and Doncaster Cup. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Assessor was sent to France and became successful sire of steeplechase horses. His offspring included My Way de Solzen, Reve de Sivola (Long Walk Hurdle), Anibale Fly (3rd in the Cheltenham Gold Cup) and Coo Star Sivola (Ultima Handicap Chase). He died in 2012 at the age of 23.

Since his retirement in early 2000s he has become known as a philanthropist. He founded the Dynasty Foundation and the Zimin Foundation. Early life and education Dmitry Zimin graduated from Moscow secondary school number 59. In high school he became engaged in radio engineering. In 1950, he entered the Faculty of Radio Electronics of the Aircraft of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI), from where he graduated in 1957. Then he secured the position of an engineer in the Problem Laboratory of MAI, organized under Mikhail Neumann. Career in science and technology In 1962, Zimin was invited to work in the Radio Technical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. For more than thirty-five years he held managerial positions at this institute: he was the head of the laboratory, then for fourteen years, the head of the scientific department, and then the director of the center for the development of radio equipment. Zimin got his PhD degree in 1963 and the post-doctoral degree in 1984. As a researcher of phased antenna arrays, he was appointed deputy chief designer of the Don-2N radar. In total, he published over 100 scientific works and inventions. VimpelCom In the last years of the USSR, there was a sharp reduction in the defense contracts for the Radio Technical Institute. In March 1991, Zimin founded a private commercial enterprise \\"KB Impulse\\". It hired the technical experts who worked at the Institute and specialized in communication systems. In 1991 Zimin organized a group of technical experts within the Radio Technical Institute for development of cellular telephone communications. At the initial stage, an American cellular equipment manufacturer and operator owned by Fabela family was invited as a partner. In 1992 the joint-stock company \\"Vimpel-Communications\\" (VimpelCom) was established, with Zimin as President and General Director. Zimin managed the operational activity of the company, while his partner Augie K. Fabela II contributed equipment and money and managed sales and marketing. Soon VimpelCom launched a pilot AMPS station in Moscow. The company became successful, and In 1996 it became the first Russian company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which required the degree of transparency uncommon for the Russian companies at that time. In 2001, at the age of 68, Dmitry Zimin sold his controlling stake in VimpelCom and left the position of general director of the company. He was honored the title of the Founder and Honorary President of the company. In 2001 Zimin was awarded the ‚ÄúBusiness-Olympus‚Äù prize in the nomination ‚ÄúBusiness Reputation‚Äù. Russian edition of Forbes magazine rated Dmitry Zimin as 63rd richest person in Russia in 2004 and 52nd in 2005. Post-VimpelCom business activity Zimin is investing to various enterprises. In 2019, BMT Private Equity, founded by Zimin, bought the Russian carsharing company BelkaCar. Dynasty Foundation Since his retirement, Dmitry Zimin devoted most of his time and wealth to philanthropic activities, mainly facilitated through his Dynasty Foundation in Russia. The Foundation's priorities were the development of fundamental scientific research and education in Russia, creating conditions so that scientists can research and teach at home in Russia, the popularization of science and civic education. The foundation was the first private Russian nonprofit foundation supporting science and education in modern Russia. It ran projects for the support and popularization of science and the development of formal and civic education. These included programs that supported gifted schoolchildren, future scientists, young physicists, mathematicians, biologists, and teachers Zimin was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in 2013, the first Russian philanthropist to win the award. In February 2015, he received the \\"For Fidelity to Science\\" award from the Russian Federation's Ministry of Education and Science. Minor planet 315493 Zimin is named after Dmitry Zimin. In 2015, Dynasty was included by Russian Ministry of Justice in the list of ‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù. Zimin closed the foundation. A number of scientists and public figures condemned the position of the Ministry of Justice regarding the fund, considering the decision to be bureaucratic and unfair. Zimin continued his philanthropic activities through the Zimin Foundation. In Russia it supports the Enlightener Prize, the Independent University of Moscow, and other projects. International projects supported by the Zimin Foundation in public health care, science, education, and culture include Ariel University (Israel), The School of Molecular and Theoretical Biology, Tel-Aviv University (Israel), and others.

The World Roller Games are a single, multi-sport event that serve as the World Championships of eleven disciplines: alpine, artistic, inline downhill, inline freestyle, inline hockey, rink hockey, roller derby, roller freestyle, scooter, skateboard, and speed. =Olympic Games= In 1992, roller hockey was played at the 1992 Summer Olympics as a demonstration sport. Skateboarding events have been introduced for the 2020 Summer Olympics, with two events: park and street. Much like BMX cycling, the park event will feature what resembles an empty swimming pool. Competitors will have three timed runs for tricks. On street, there will be ramps and rails for routines and tricks. There will be a total of 80 total spots, with 20 in each event. Each country can enter a maximum of three athletes in each event. =World Games= Roller sports have been represented at the World Games since the first games, held in 1981. Both artistic skating and inline speed skating track have been featured at every holding of the Games, and either roller hockey or inline hockey has been featured at all but the 1997 World Games. The International World Games Association (IWGA) announced on 16 April 2018 that four roller sports would be included in the 30 official sports competing for gold at the 2021 World Games, during 15‚Äì25 June in Birmingham, Alabama. Birmingham marks the 40th anniversary of the event which will feature 3,600 athletes from more than 100 countries. This the first time the World Games has returned to the United States since 1981. On the programme for the 2021 World Games are four roller sports disciplines; artistic skating, inline hockey, and two speed skating types, road and track. Roller sport is the only sport-type on the World Games programme to be represented in three separate clusters, with speed skating categorized with \\"Trend Sports\\", artistic skating with \\"Artistic Sports,\\" and inline hockey with \\"Ball Sports\\". =Pan American Games= In May 2019, the scheduled skateboarding event was removed from the Lima 2019 Pan American Games.

Composed in 1911, they were first published in Philadelphia in 1914 as The Responsories.  History  Reger composed the responsories in 1911 to English texts for Luther D. Reed, a professor of liturgy who wanted to use contemporary music in services of the American Lutheran Church. Reed was interested in a return to older forms of services such as vespers which call for responsorial singing. In the summer of 1911, the organist Harry G. Archer travelled to Germany and requested a setting by Reger of the texts on Reed's behalf. Reger, who spoke no English, is reported to have asked Archer for a detailed translation, explaining the meaning of single words and marking stressed syllables. Reger wrote the music and apparently had the manuscript checked, as later changes show. The compositions were completed in September 1911. Reger's settings are intended to be sung by lay performers. They are set mainly in homophony, ensuring clear understanding of the texts. The responsories were published in 1914 by Luther D. Reed and The Church Music and Liturgical Art Society of Philadelphia. Compared to the manuscript, the printing has several changes concerning rhythmical details and the distribution of words to the music. Reger probably never obtained a copy; at least none was found in his possession when he died. In 1961, Hermann Grabner (1886-1969) edited a critical edition for the complete edition of Reger's works, volume 27 of Max Reger: S√§mtliche Werke, printed in Wiesbaden by Breitkopf & H√§rtel. They also published versions in German, 20 Responsorien, in five volumes of four each, and additional single copies. A critical edition was published by Carus-Verlag in 2007, edited by Andreas Becker. In English it is based on Reger's manuscript, and in German it has slight melismas and rhythmical subdivisions. In 2013, the responsories were published by Nabu Press.  Text and music  The 20 responsories are set for choir a cappella. They partly follow the liturgical year.

It was designed by Charles H. Halstead. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  = Indigenous history = = District history = Captain John Hunter and Captain Arthur Phillip led the first expeditions north of Sydney Cove into the tribal lands of the Gurringal soon after the landing of the first fleet, searching for suitable agricultural land and fresh water. Rock carvings are the only evidence of Aboriginal habitation. In 1896 a large expanse of bushland was reserved as parkland and named Ku-ring-gai Chase for the original inhabitants. This name was also adopted by the shire formed in 1906 and the municipality gazetted in 1928. Millwood Farm on Blue Gum Creek was established in 1814 by a marine, Williarn Henry, the first white settler in the Ku-ring-gal area. In the 1820s ex-convict Joseph Fidden, a major force in the districts development, eventually became a ferryman after a brief attempt at farming. He rowed sawn timber from the government sawpits on the Lane Cove River to Sydney and dropped off supplies to settlements on his way home. The sly-grog and other facilities he provided at the infamous Fiddens Wharf attracted the rough-living sawyers and bushmen of the district. Later Daniel Mathew established two sawmills, one at Clanville (Roseville) in 1825 and another at Rosedale (Pymble) in 1838. Most of sawyers moved on when the trees were felled, leaving cleared land for fanners and orchardists who followed. One was Robert Pymble who gave his name to the suburb where he established the first north shore orange orchard. Other early settlers were Richard Archbold at Roseville and Robert Pockley at Killara. The Lane Cove River was used to carry the produce to Sydney. The harbour barrier delayed the suburbanisation of the Ku-ring-gai district and in the early 1880s the tiny settlement was judged too small to warrant a railway line. Access to Milsons Point remained difficult although a coach service pliedthat route from 1881 to 1887. By 1885 it was also possible to travel to Sydney via the five bridges road crossing the water at Fig Tree, Gladesville, Iron Cove, Glebe Island and Pyrmont. The single-track North Shore railway line that went from Hornsby to St Leonards in 1890 finally reached Milsons Point in 1893 where passenger and vehicular ferries completed the journey to the city. The North Shore Ferry Company had been carrying passengers from Milsons Point to Circular Quay since the 1860s and by the 1890s around 5 million people crossed the harbour by this means every year. Offering suburban subdivisions along the railway line in advance of the stations, speculators developed Ku-ring-gai well before completion of the North Shore Bridge in 1932 set off another flurry of real estate promotion. Ku-ring-gai grew slowly in the nineteenth century, its population being 4,000 by 1901. However, over the next two decades its population quadrupled. By this time, with its large residences in beautiful, leafy surrounds, it had changed from a district with a dubious reputation to one that attracted people of high socio-economic status, 73 per cent of whom were home owners. During the interwar years of 1921 to 1933, the population increased by 45 per cent from 19,209 to 27,931 with a 68 per cent rise in the number of occupied dwellings, the proportion of brick to weatherboard being 5:1. The same sort of increase occurred from 1933 to 1947 when a further 43 per cent of people moved into the district bringing the total population to 39,874 and adding 3,564 houses. Even greater restriction on the use of timber and fibro occurred in this period so that 3,182 of these were brick. Clearly, Ku-ring-gai suffered less in the 1930s depression than other municipalities where development was much slower. Its people also encountered less unemployment - only slightly behind Vaucluse with 16 per cent unemployed, Ku- ring-gai and Mosman registered 18 per cent unemployed in 1933 - although the proportion of owner occupation did fall to 68 per cent.AHC Register of the National Estate - indicative place listing - Mahratta Avenue Urban Conservation Area = The Briars = The Briars was built on land first granted to John Terry Hughes on 18 August 1842. Hughes' grant comprised 2,000 acres and was part of Portion 400A of the Parish of Gordon, County of Cumberland. After Hughes' death in 1851 the land was conveyed to a number of businessmen and land speculators who subdivided it into four major estates.Robertson & Hindmarsh, 2010, 3 The Briars marks the first period of residential expansion in Wahroonga which followed the opening of the railway in 1890. The Bundarra Estate was offered for sale in 1892. The estate stretched from the Pacific Highway (then known as Lane Cove Road) north across the North Shore Railway, lay west of Woonona Avenue and encompassed the properties on both sides of Bundarra Avenue. Jessie Edith Balcombe, wife of public servant William Alexander Balcombe (1855-1939) purchased lots 5, 6 and 16 of the Bundarra Estate on 14 April 1895 and built The Briars on Lot 16 in 1895, facing Woonona Avenue. The Briars was designed in 1895 by architect Charles Herbert Halstead (1865-1941) for William Alexander Balcombe. Halstead is considered to be the architect for West Maling (1889), constructed in Penshurst. He was also the architect for the Old Science Building (1899) at Sydney Grammar School and was the architect for a number of church and public buildings in the southern suburbs of Sydney. It was financed by a mortgage from William Henry Hargraves, Deputy Registrar in Equity (Balcombe's employer). Halstead was a young architect born and trained in England who migrated with his family to Australia. He practiced as an architect and a nurseryman from 1893 to 1912 and then again solely as an architect from 1912 until he ceased practice in about 1935. Balcombe's uncle had formerly been Governor of St Helena - a volcanic island in the Southern Atlantic Ocean; it is believed that the house that he lived in on St Helena was also called The Briars and that this house was built to the same plan.National Trust (NSW), 1983 Napoleon Bonaparte reputedly had lived in the Governor's house on St. Helena for some time after his exile to the island in 1815, while a permanent residence was being built for him. William Alexander Balcombe was son of Thomas Balcombe, who worked for the Australian Agricultural Company at Port Stephens, and as a survey draftsman in Sydney for the Surveyor-General. William married Jessie Edith Griffen on 1 July 1884 at Raymond Terrace. He became Chief Clerk in Equity. William died at Hornsby in 1939. Jessie was still living in 1944. In 1903 the Electoral Roll recorded them both living at 14 Woonona Avenue, Wahroonga.Murley, 2007 Several historical records reveal that Napoleon was often seen playing with Balcombe children during his stay with the family.Liu, 2015, 13 The garden is much reduced by subdivision. In November 1924 Jessie Balcombe sold parts of Lots 5 & 6 (fronting Bundarra Avenue) subject to covenant and retained Lot 16 and the eastern parts of Lots 5 & 6\\\\. In 1935 she was listed as the sole proprietor of The Briars. By this time the estate had been reduced to 1 acre 2 roods and 29 1/2 perches in area and comprised Lot 16 and the eastern parts of Lots 5 & 6 which contained the stables and other essential outbuildings. The Great Depression hit the Balcombes hard as they were mortgaged to the Bank of Australasia from 1935 until 1941 and in 1941 Jessie sold The Briars to Winifred Laura Phipps, wife of Joseph John Flower Phipps of Chatswood, merchant. The Phipps continued to own the estate until 1949 when Lot A was sold to Nathaniel Joseph Victor Howes. Lot A comprised what is now known as no.s 12 and 14 Woonona Avenue and was the same as the original Lot 16 minus the two access driveways excised in 1959 to give access to Lots B and C which were the remnants of the original back paddocks of The Briars. Howes owned The Briars until 1968 when it was sold to Ian and Judith Heydon of Wahroonga. As part of the process of selling The Briars, it appears that Howes subdivided the allotment into the two lots known today as 12 and 14 Woonona Avenue (containing the house of The Briars).Liu, 2015, 1-5 The front block (12 Woonona Avenue) was built upon, with a single storey red brick home that obscured views of The Briars to its rear (north). The former tennis court (between Woonona Avenue and the Briars house's front door) was subdivided off and a single storey house built there (). The Briars' driveway (which led to the former stables on the house's west)(demolished) was subdivided off. There is now a steep bank along this western boundary. There is a line of coniferous trees about where a Himalayan cedar tree (Cedrus deodara) was (in a photograph of a tall deodar/Himalayan cedar was to the west of the house, along with a giant bird-of-paradise flower (Strelitzia nicolae). Both are now gone). These were between what is now the garage and the boundary fence. The creeping fig (Ficus pumila var.pumila) that covered the portico in 1915 was removed for a period and restored to the portico in the 1960s. An 8' high chain wire fence along the eastern boundary was erected in the 1960s (probably ). A photograph shows the house open to the tennis court, but with two flanking wire mesh fences (starting roughly at the house's outside walls') that appear to be climbing in height (presumably to stop tennis balls). In 1972 the Heydons sympathetically renovated The Briars house. In 1983 the Heydons requested that a Permanent Conservation Order be placed over the property.Lui, 2005, 4-5 Subdivision of former Briars estate (1990s?) was approved by Land & Environment Court (SEPP5) and 6 single storey villas were built adjoining the State Heritage Register boundary, on an adjacent block, while retaining a line of mature turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) on the drive to the house's (and one to 12 Woonona Avenue's south-west) west. John and Elizabeth Fuller bought the property in 1999 when in poor condition, sympathetically renovating it further (over two years: Liu, 2015, 13) along with its garden. The garden has been planted in a more formal \\"compartmentalised\\" manner of garden \\"rooms\\" and one which seeks to screen by hedging adjacent development which has encroached on the property on all sides. The house on its former tennis court at the front facing Woonona Avenue was demolished in 2009 and, after refusal in a NSW Land & Environment Court appeal, a modified application for a two-storey residential flat building was approved on 12 Woonona Avenue by the Ku-Ring-Gai Planning Panel in 12/2008. Construction proceeded there in 2009 to the extent of excavation and construction of the basement car park. On 30 October 2009 Ku-Ring-Gai Council purchased this block for open space so that an appropriate visual curtilage could be reinstated for The Briars. In January 2010 Council filled and re- grassed the site (12 Woonona Avenue) as a small public park, thus restoring part of the \\"front\\" setting (and curtilage) of The Briars to Woonona Avenue, allowing it to be seen from there again.Robertson & Hindmarsh, 2010, 5HIS, 2009, pers.comm., J.Fuller, 8 January 2010 The Fullers have opened their home to the National Trust of Australia (NSW) and their garden through Australia's Open Garden Scheme (now Open Gardens Australia). The property is now on the real estate market.  Description  = Setting = A large garden surrounds the house (although reduced by subdivision, notably of the former tennis court to its east and land to its south. From the east/ street the garden was (until its 2009 demolition) screened by a single storey 1950s house built on (the former) tennis court, however glimpses of large tree tops and very interesting chimney pots give hints of the garden within. A gravel carriageway into the \\"hatchet\\" shaped block (around a small park on what was previously the Briars' tennis court) is flanked with hedges, leading to the front door and around to the garage on the south side. The house is faced with verandahs across the front (east) and down part of both sides (north/south). The sloping block is terraced level at the front and on both sides. On the north side an old cast iron fountain in a pond makes a focal point in the lawn. Steps behind (west of) the house lead down to the large back garden which is divided into several \\"garden rooms\\" varying from quite formal areas to very natural spaces.Hook, 2006, 7, botanical names added by Stuart Read, 15/4/09 = Garden = The grounds while considerably reduced by subdivision retain several large turpentine trees (Syncarpia glomulifera) at the rear (west) of the siteNational Trust Listing Proposal, 1983 and a large English elm (Ulmus procera) in the north-eastern corner. An interesting large garden surrounds the house. From the east/ street the garden is separated by a lot of and on which a c.1950s house was built and which was prior to that house's construction, The Briars' tennis court. This s house was demolished in 2009. Glimpses of large tree tops and very interesting chimney pots give hints of the Briars' garden within. Over the past eight years the present owners have restored and developed the garden. A gravel carriageway into the \\"hatchet\\" shaped block is flanked with photinia hedges under-planted with blue flowered Nile lily (Agapanthus orientalis). The drive leads to the front door and around to the garage on the south side of the house. Here very old azaleas (Rhododendron indicum cv.s) line the edge of the veranda and near the back door an enormous old white flowered camellia (C.japonica cv.) remains. A pair of old cypress trees and a more recently planted lily pilly hedge line the southern boundary and an old jacaranda (J.mimosifolia) spreads in the south eastern corner of the property. The house is faced with verandahs across the front (east) and down part of both sides (north/south). On the north eastern corner of this verandah an old rose - \\"Pierre de Ronsard\\" weaves amongst the old trellis panels. The sloping block is terraced level at the front and on both sides. On the north side an old cast iron fountain in a pond constructed from old bricks and filled with iris is a focal point in the lawn. The perimeter garden bed has box hedging and is planted out with bear's britches (Acanthus mollis), winter roses/ hellebores (Helleborus orientalis & H.niger), windflowers (Anemone hupehensis cv.) etc. Steps behind (west of) the house under a large tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica) lead down to the large back garden which is divided into several \\"garden rooms\\" varying from quite formal areas to very natural spaces. The area directly off the back porch (to the west) & outdoor living space features old brick paving and steps down to an area of lawn surrounded in part with contrasting twin hedges of box (Buxus sp.) and silver germander (Teucrium sp.) or with box only (in the shaded area). A large sandstone urn containing a variegated leafed star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides 'Variegata') is placed on a plinth & creates a centre piece, the beds are planted with iceberg roses, agapanthus and ground covers. Under a large old English elm (Ulmus procera) in the north-western corner of the garden the ground has been paved with white pebbles in a circle to reflect the canopy of the tree above, the surrounding beds are planted with magnolias, ferns, hydrangeas, gardenias and feature statuary. In the backyard is an area where a group of large remnant turpentines grace the property, many natives including blueberry ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus), birdsnest ferns (Asplenium australasicum), matt rush (Lomandra sp.) and river lily (Crinum pedunculatum), have been planted in the filtered light. Old bricks form meandering paths through these trees and from here glimpses & vistas of the formal parts of the backyard can be seen.Hook, 2006, 7, botanical names added by Stuart Read, 15/4/09, updated 8/1/2010 = House = The Briars is a well- built house retaining a large proportion of the original fabric. Joinery, screenwork and hardware (fireplaces etc.) are all original (as of 1983). Many parts of the garden are in their original form. Twelve old turpentine trees (Syncarpia glomulifera) remain from one of the earliest stands (Heritage Branch). The style is transitional between the late Victorian Italianate and Federation. It is a single storey brick house with a hipped slate roof. A projecting brick bay with three stuccoed arches marks the front entrance and intersects a timber framed verandah which surrounds the house on three sides. The verandah is decorated with timber brackets and dentillation. Shuttered french doors open onto the verandah from the principal rooms. Internally it retains much of its original joinery and fireplaces. When Mr and Mrs Fuller purchased the property in 1998, it was in poor state of repairs. There were over 800 broken slates on the roof and no electricity in some rooms. Bathroom and kitchen were almost nonexistent. However, its splendid bones were intact. Carpet had concealed and protected tallow wood floors, now polished and oiled. The original fireplaces, doors, windows and ceiling roses were intact. Notice the servant bells on the side of the fireplaces. The drive follows the original carriage way around the front of the new development. the front entrance has its original tiles. The stained glass door is replicated at the end of the hallway. The owners have, so far as practicable, furnished the home with period or earlier furnishings. Hallway: As you enter, notice the collection of plates on the plate railing. On the right is a William IV rosewood \\"Banjo\\" Barometer, . In the middle of the hallway is a Victorian burr walnut centre table, . The longcase mahogany-veneered oak clock, , is a family heirloom. At the end of the hallway is an Irish regency mahogany side table, . Main bedroom: The mahogany queen-sized bedstead is William IV. The flame mahogany chest of drawers, the dressing table and the breakfront wardrobe are all Victorian pieces. The patchwork bed covering was made by Mrs Fuller to tone with the curtains. Here you see one of the many original fireplaces. Second bedroom: Notice the original cast iron ceiling rose and tongue and grooved ceiling. The crocheted bedspread was made by Mr Fuller's mother. The three door cedar wardrobe is mid-Victorian. The wall-mirror is late Victorian and is a family piece. Library: Again, notice the original cast iron rose and the tongue and grooved ceiling. The mahogany revolving drum table is Victorian. the French walnut bookcase, , is an early example of prefabricated furniture. the Victorian ebonized walnut card table is a family piece. Third bedroom: The wardrobe is Australian cedar, . The distinguished gentleman in the picture is a great, great uncle. Dining room: This elegant room has a splendid fireplace. On the mantle piece is a French clock. the clock and the small statue of Napoleon is a reminder of the Emperor's connection with the Balcombe family. On the William IV breakfast pedestal sideboard are pieces of family silver and an early blue and white set of Meissan cups, saucers and eggcups. The Victorian table and chairs are mahogany. A handsome tantalus rests on a Victorian chiffonier. The pig pot is from Papua New Guinea, where the Fullers lived in the early 1980s. Formal Sitting Rom: The furniture is mainly early Victorian mahogany. The small chiffonier is . Many of the china pieces and family heirlooms. Note the tea caddy has its original crystal bowl. The small (Chinese) Cabinet is Victorian and has been in the family for over 100 years. Study: The ceiling is a mystery. The Colonial cedar bookcase and the Victorian Mahogany desk feature. Family Sitting Room: Over a pine dresser is a story board from the Sepik River area in Papua New Guinea. Morning room: Note the prints of paintings by Thomas Balcombe and a recent photo of The Briars on St Helena. The early photos of The Briars date from . The Verandah: Has some of its original posts and the beam that supports the verandah, you can see the new development emerging in the south western corner of the Briars. Note the original chimney pots with fans on the roof. The Garden: The owners found a jungle when they bought the property; some sixty trips to the rubbish tip were needed to clear the property. However, a number of old trees and shrubs were retained. The tall turpentine trees are remnants of the natural vegetation, The pathway through the forest leading to the stables was uncovered. In 2006 and 2007, the garden was open under the Australian Open Garden Scheme attracting over 600 visitors. = Condition = As at 8 August 2016, the house is in good condition and has been sympathetically renovated by its present owners. Joinery, screenwork and hardware (fireplaces etc.) are all original (as of 1983). Many parts of the garden are in their original form.

Heritage listing  As at 15 February 2011, The Briars has state heritage significance for its historic, cultural, archaeological and aesthetic values. It is a good example of a transitional late Victorian/early Federation architectural style house. It is a prime example of the style of development prevalent in the local area at the turn of the 20th century. Historically it is significant as it represents the first period of residential expansion in Wahroonga which followed the opening of the railway in 1890. The Briars is associated with: William Alexander Balcombe, who built The Briars in Wahroonga, was the grandson of William Balcombe (Snr) who was Navel Agent and Purveyor for the East India Company on the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic during the exile of Napoleon Bonaparte on the island. His uncle was briefly associated with Napoleon Bonaparte during his period of exile on the island of St. Helena. Bonaparte was incarcerated there on the 15 October 1815 after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Whilst his accommodation at Longwood was made more habitable, he lived with the Balcombes at their home on St Helena, The Briars. More particularly, he lived in the Pavilion on the Briars' Estate, which still remains today.William Alexander's father, Thomas Tyrwhitt Balcombe was born on St Helena on 15 June 1810. There are reports in a number of history books that Napoleon was often seen playing with the Balcombe children during his stay with the Family. William Balcombe (Snr) eventually emigrated to New South Wales where he became the first Colonial Treasurer. Thomas became a well known Colonial artist and many of his works can be seen in the Mitchell Library. The Balcombes had a family tradition of naming their houses The Briars. The house on St Helena was The Briars and the pavilion on the estate where Napolion stayed has an obvious similarity in overall form to The Briars at Wahroonga. There is also a house at , Victoria that was built by Thomas's brother, Alexander Beatson Balcombe called The Briars. The similarity in design of the 1860 additions to the house in Mornington to that of The Briars at Wahroonga and the pavilion on St Helena are obvious.Heritage Office, 1999Sheedy, D., 1976, National Trust, 1983 The Briars was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Founded in 1927 by James T. Jackson and Sadie Jackson, it is the only daily newspaper in Seminole County, and the largest newspaper within an 18-mile radius of Seminole, Oklahoma. The paper currently has a circulation of 5,400. History The Seminole Producer was founded on March 1, 1927 by James T. Jackson and his wife Sadie Jackson. They had come to Seminole after selling a printing plant in Kansas. Its owner moved the printing plant to Seminole, Oklahoma, where the Seminole Morning Tribune was established. Upon failure of the Tribune, the plant was sold back to Jackson, who did job printing in order to maintain the Producer before the paper's rise to prominence. Despite a slow start, the Seminole Producer rose in popularity after it reported on corruption cases in the county's police department. The Jacksons owned the Seminole Producer until 1946. In 1946, the paper was purchased by Milt and Tom Phillips. The paper would later purchase and assimilate the Seminole County News in 1948, and the Wewoka Times and Wewoka Democrat in 1950. Tom Phillips died of cancer in 1956, and the Wewoka papers were sold. In order to retain employees, Milt sold minority interests to three of his staffers Alex Adwan, Ted Phillips, and Carroll Sciance, with Adwan later selling his share. Carroll continued to partner with Milt until Milt's death in 1979. Carroll continued in partnership with Ted until 1992 when he died. Upon Carroll's death, Ted Phillips' son Stu Phillips took Carroll's place as co-owner with Ted. After Ted Phillips died in 2004, Stu Phillips became the editor and publisher of the Producer. Milt Phillips Award The Milt Phillips Award is an annual award given by the Oklahoma Press Association to outstanding journalists in Oklahoma. Established in 1978, the award is named after former Seminole Producer owner Milt Phillips. The award recognizes individuals based on quality publishing, and their service to the local community and state.Oklahoma Press Association End of Phillips Ownership The unexpected sudden death of Stu Phillips at the age of 55 on December 30, 2018, ended the Phillips family connection with the Producer. The Seminole Economic Development Council (SEDC) realized that the area could lose the paper and the jobs connected to its existence, and put together a plan to save the institution. The Seminole Community Foundation quickly became involved in helping the SEDC to buy the newspaper business. Foundation President, Shari Carter, said: The Seminole Economic Development Council has reached an agreement in principle to purchase the assets of three Seminole County newspapers following the Dec. 30 death of Stu Phillips, the Seminole Producer's third-generation publisher. ‚ÄúSEDC is in the job creation and job retention business,\\" said attorney Jack Mattingly Sr., chairman of the Seminole Economic Development Authority. \\"When it became clear to us that not only were we going to lose jobs but a big piece of our history, we decided to do what we could to save the newspaper.\\" Assets of the Seminole, Wewoka and Konawa newspapers are included in the pending sales agreement, which the Seminole Economic Development Council worked out with assistance from the Seminole Community Foundation, officials said. Seminole Community Foundation president, Shari Carter, issued the following statement about her organization's involvement.‚ÄúIt is clear that the newspaper business is tough right now, but we just couldn't allow it to shut its doors without a fight, those employees mean a lot to our city. And collectively the Seminole, Wewoka and Konawa newspapers are an important anchor in our county.‚Äù Steve Saxon, Seminole's city manager and SEDC's executive director, clarified the rescue strategy: \\"The structure of the acquisition is pretty simple. \\"We are buying the assets of the company and our intent is to lease or sell those assets to someone with business acumen and experience with publishing.

It is the type species of the genus Mortierella, and was first described in 1863 by Henri Coemans. A characteristic feature of the fungus is the presence of stylospores, which are aerial, spiny resting spores (chlamydospores). History and taxonomy M. polycephala was the first species described in the genus Mortierella of the phylum Zygomycota. It has been observed on feces of bats and rodents, such as mice and rats, and it was first described by Coemans on the Bulletin de l'Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences de Belgique in 1863. Coemans isolated it from wood rot polypore fungi in the genera Daedalea and Polyporus, however he did not study the mycelium or the chlamydospores. The study of the previous characteristics was done by Van Tieghem who described the sporangia, chlamydospores and stylospores. The species is characterized by the presence of many stylospores (aerial chlamydospores) and sporangiospores arising from aerial hyphae. Jean Dauphin, a professor at The University of Paris dedicated 28 pages to the description, study and experimentation on M. polycephala in his publication Contribution √† l'√âtude des Mortierell√©es (1908). In his paper, this species was the only one in which external factors were assessed to determine their role in stimulating the production of zygospores. M. indohii has been proposed as a closely related species to M. polycephala by several studies based on the production of stylospores by both species. Based on phylogenetic analyses where the complete ITS region, and LSU and SSU genes were assessed, close relationship between the two species has been proposed. Growth and morphology Colonies are white with a spider web-like texture and sparse growth; they have a garlic-like aroma and can measure up to 7.5 cm in diameter after 5 days at 20 ¬∞C on malt extract agar. Sporangiophores in this species measure 300-500 Œºm long: they are 12.5-20 Œºm wide at the base, being reduced to 3.5-5 Œºm at the tip. They can be single or come in clusters; primary branches are present mostly in the upper part of the sporangiophore and they may give rise to secondary and tertiary branches of 12-90 Œºm long. Sporangia are brown, round (globose), with a diameter of 37-75 Œºm and they can contain 4-20 spores. M. polycephala' sporangia can grow well between 10 ¬∞C and 25 ¬∞C, with an optimum temperature of about 17 ¬∞C. Sporangiospores are hyaline, they measure 5.5-13.2 Œºm long and have an oval to irregular shape. The optimum germination temperature is 27 ¬∞C. Zygospores can be up to 1 mm in diameter andare produced by both homothallic and heterothallic mechanisms; they are well formed between 15 ¬∞C and 22 ¬∞C. Stylospores can be aerial or submerged, they are hyaline and can be found alone or in groups. Their diameter is around 20 Œºm. = Physiology = M. polycephala is able to decompose chitin, liquify gelatin, and produce ethanol, oxalic acid and acetic acid if grown on a glucose medium. Minimal growth is observed at 4 ¬∞C; 17 ¬∞C is optimal for growth, and growth is not observed above 27 ¬∞C. In his experiments Dauphin exposed the fungus to extremely low temperature using liquid air. He observed that at , the spores of M. polycephala did not germinate but were not killed and germinated once returned to ambient temperature. At 4 ¬∞C, the chlamydospores and spores could germinate after 3 days and the mycelium was not abundant, yielding this as the minimum temperature at which M. polycephala could grow. At 15 ¬∞C germination was the best for M. polycephala: it took 2 days and the mycelium was abundant, but not too crowded. From 22-27 ¬∞C mycelium generation started to occur too fast and too crowded; and at 32 ¬∞C conditions started to get unhealthy for germination. Finally at 45 ¬∞C and higher temperatures, the spores died and germination was not possible. Dauphin also discussed the effects of the lack of oxygen in the fungus growth and concluded it was not a determining factor affecting germination. Growth of M. polycephala' occurs best in natural or artificial light, and is reduced when colonies are grown in darkness; although no difference in size or morphology of fructifications is seen between colonies developed under differing lighting conditions. M. polycephala grows more slowly under thermal radiation than under longer wavelengths (violet, ultraviolet, blue light) where germination is accelerated. M. polycephala shows a tolerance to short-duration X-ray exposure. Longer periods of x-ray exposure result in slowed germination or death. Dauphin used a radium tube given to him by Professor Pierre Curie to assess the tolerance of M. polycephala to ionizing radiation. He placed the fungus on a Petri dish, and situated the aperture of the radium source towards the centre of the dish. He found that at the borders of the dish, where radiation was more distant, germination was not affected: it was more abundant than normal; however, towards the centre of the dish growth became reduced. He also compared fungal growth exposed to radium with growth under normal conditions using duplicate cultures of the same strain of M. polycephala. The control yielded normal growth and development, but the radium-exposed culture manifested double or triple the normal growth rate in some filaments while others developed cysts. Habitat and ecology M. polycephala has been reported on decaying polypores, arable and desert soil, trees such as beech and spruce, flowering plants like Calluna, alfalfa roots, wheat, tomato and cabbage; and other ecosystems like salt marshes and slate slopes. It is a saprotroph fungi, extensively distributed in Europe: Belgium, France, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Germany and Switzerland; Asia: China, Japan, India and Indonesia; and America: Brazil and Mexico. Its spores are transmitted via air or water movement. Although several articles and books report M. polycephala as a cause of pulmonary infections for cattle and abortion in cattle, a primary source that confirms this statement has not been found and no other sources have reproduced the findings. A single report of animal infection attributed M. polycephala may represent a misidentified strain of M. wolfii.

The book touches on issues including immigration, colonialism, race, gender, labor, and activism. Bohulano Mabalon draws on rich oral histories as well as historical archives such as the National Pinoy Archives and Filipino American National Historical Society to provide an analysis on Filipina/o experience. The book won the honorable mention for the Frederick Jackson Turner Award by the Organization of American Historians in 2014.  Summary  Mabalon provides cultural, economic, and political context that led thousands of Filipina/os to migrate to Hawaii and the U.S. in the early twentieth century. After the victory in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, the U.S. gained full control over the Philippines until 1946. American colonization implemented the American public school system, which inculcated Filipina/os to believe in American Dream and American exceptionalism. It also brought capitalism, which replaced the barter economy and eventually led to economic instabilities. These changes created a condition for Filipina/os to leave their motherland. Many chose to settle in Stockton, California where labor demand in farm work was steady. Despite their hopes of finding a better opportunity, what they found in the San Joaquin Delta was racial discrimination and horrible labor conditions that treated them as second class citizens. They were forced to overcome regional and linguistic differences that would otherwise separate them in the Philippines, unite as Filipina/o Americans, and fight for their rights. They established Little Manila in Stockton where they began forming fraternal organizations, labor unions, churches and community organizations in order to survive anti-Filipina/o sentiment. Little Manila was the largest Filipina/o community outside of the Philippines until its decay due to urban redevelopment and gentrification in the 1960s. The author describes the daily life of Filipina/os between 1930s and World War II, paying particular attention to the role of women and religion in community formation. Due to a skewed sex ratio, women were considered valuable and they took advantage of the situation to alter the restrictive traditional gender roles. They played important parts in both domestic and public spheres as caretakers, wage earners, and community organizers. By doing this, they were able to redefine femininity and family. Religion also became an important part of Filipina/o community building. As a former Spanish colony, most Filipina/os were Catholic upon their arrival. However, they converted to Protestants because Catholic churches were indifferent towards Filipina/o struggle in Stockton. Protestant missionaries provided them not only social services but also a platform for Filipina/os to organize politically and fight for fair wages. By the end of World War II, Filipinos experienced radical changes. Their racial status ameliorated due to their military service in World War II and the removal of Japanese Americans into concentration camps. Due to Japanese business owners' and farm contractors' maltreatment and abuse of Filipino labor, Filipino workers took advantage of the incarceration of Japanese Americans to improve their work conditions and broaden the border of the Little Manila. However, these improvements and prosperity did not last too long because Stockton planned large-scale urban redevelopment projects. These projects which included freeway construction destroyed much of Little Manila, forced businesses to close, and displaced residents. Low-income residents were placed in bug- infested motels. Thus, the redevelopment projects contributed to the decay of vibrant organizations and businesses and shattering of the community. It was the new generation of Filipina/o Americans as well as immigrants who came after the 1960s that stood up against the city to demand rights on behalf of already displaced members of the Little Manila. They envisioned and campaigned for ‚ÄúFilipino Center‚Äù in order to provide low-income housing and hold retails by and for Filipina/os. Mabalon writes in detail the messiness of community organizing and difficulty of gaining support from both within and outside their community. After four years of struggle, they succeeded in receiving funds to construct the Filipino Center, which became a symbol of hope for community members as well as a model for other Filipino centers around the nation. Reception The general reception of the book is positive and seen as an important contribution to Filipino American Community whose history has been treated as a marginalized American history. It provides insightful analysis to those interested in not only histories of Filipino/a American or California in the twentieth century but also immigration, gender, race, labor, activism, and colonialism. The chapter on women's role (Ch. 4) is considered a valuable addition because previous research did not pay much attention to women's contribution to community formation in Stockton in the early twentieth century. Although her work represents a fine academic rigor, Mabalon's language is accessible to non-academic readers. The extensive use of oral histories, personal stories, and photographs enrich her historical analysis as it sheds light on Filipina/o Americans' contribution to both California's agricultural development and labor movements.

Named after the small leaf linden that grew on the island, Lindholmen was founded in 1848 and closed in 1976. It was at one time the largest employer in Gothenburg and produced some of the most powerful ships in the Swedish Navy, as well as the first modern oil tanker. Early years Gustaf II Adolf, the first iron-hulled ship There is evidence that there was \\"a loading place (...) a loading dock with a storage bed of ship repair beams\\" () in 1844 and the first ship known to have been built at the yard, the brig Aurora, was launched in 1848, but the history of the company dates from the foundation of a joint stock company called the Lindholmens Varvs- och Fabriksaktiebolag in 1853. The company was one quarter owned by Motala Verkstad and specialised in constructing ships of steel. The first steel steamship, Gustaf II Adolf was launched on 13 December 1854. The shipyard subsequently constructed a number of major ships, including coastal defence ships for the Swedish Navy and icebreakers for Russia. One of the most important vessels was Zoroaster, constructed for Branobel to designs of Ludvig Nobel, the first modern oil tanker. The company employed 1,496 people by 1891 and was Gothenburg's largest employer. Lindholmens Verkstads AB Publicity card from about 1900 Economic factors caused Motala Verksted to go bankrupt in 1891 and the shipyard was sold for SEK 820,000 to a consortium of companies and individuals. Sven Almqvist took over the management and formed a new company, Lindholmens Verkstads AB, with SEK 1,000,000 capital. The new business employed Hugo Hammar, fresh from the United States and later to lead G√∂taverken, as the chief engineer. New commissions came in from Svenska Lloyd and, in 1903, the company was asked to build the Swedish Navy's new flagship . Other large ships followed, including two cargo vessels for the Axel Johnson Group, named Axel Johnson and Annie Johnson, launched in 1910 and 1911 respectively. In 1912, AB Bergsund purchased a majority of Motala Verksted, and so acquired their shares in Lindholemen. The company attempted to consolidate its operations to save money, but the challenge proved too difficult and in 1917, Lindholemen was bought out by Gothenburg Bank. AB Lindholmen-Motala The company saw substantial growth in the years immediately following World War I. By 1920, the company was larger than its former parent and bought all the shares in Motala Verksted for SEK 2.6 million. The new company was named AB Lindholmen-Motala. However, the business limited itself to constructing steam-powered vessels and so was incapable of accessing the emerging motor ship market. AB Linholmens Varv Astri, the first motor ship The 1930s saw another change in company structure as the steam engine business was left behind and the company focused on diesel powered motor ships. A new company, AB Linholmens Varv, was formed on 5 September 1936 with SEK 700,000 capital. Astri, a cargo ship of , was the first motor ship produced, launching in 1937. The company had an increasingly strong relationship with the Axel Johnson Group, who acquired the business in 1941. During World War II, the shipyard saw a boom, producing . The company continued to operate as part of the Axel Johnson Group after the war. In 1960, the company still employed 1,800 staff. Last years The end of the 1960s were a difficult time for the Swedish shipbuilding industry and in 1971 the Axel Johnson Group sold the shipyard, now known as Lindholmens Mekaniska Verkstad, to merge with nearby Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad. The plan was to construct a new sectional yard, but economic conditions were unfavourable. The end was in sight when Eriksbergs moved production from Lindholmen, the last vessel being built in 1974. The shipyard closed in 1976, the first in a series of closures which struck the Swedish shipbuilding industry. Since 1999, the site has been occupied by Lindholmen Science Park.

She discovered new roles for immune cells in repair and neurogenesis, coining the term \\"protective autoimmunity\\" and expanding the field of immunology in neuroscience. She has been the elected chair of the International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI) since 2016, and her book ‚ÄúNeuroimmunity: A New Science that will Revolutionize How We Keep Our Brains Healthy and Young‚Äù received an honorable mention for the 2016 PROSE Awards, Biomedicine & Neuroscience category.  Education and early career  Schwartz gained her Bachelor of Science (with distinction) in chemistry at Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1972. She received her PhD in Immunology in 1977 at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where she would later spend the majority of her career. She also spent time at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, researching nerve regeneration. At the Weizmann Institute she progressed from senior scientist in the Department of Neurobiology to a full professor in 1998, then awarded the Maurice and Ilse Katz Professorial Chair in Neuroimmunology in 2016.  Research  Schwartz's work in neuroimmunology has encompassed a wide range of pathologies in the central nervous system (CNS) including : injury, neurodegeneration, mental dysfunction, and aging. By researching the immune system and its interactions with the brain, Schwartz focuses on improving repair, regeneration and neuroplasticity in health and disease. She coined the term ‚Äúprotective autoimmunity‚Äô and demonstrated the role of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells in spinal cord repair. She also identified specific brain areas for ‚Äòcross talk‚Äô between the CNS and the immune system. This cross talk is important for recruiting immune cells and maintaining a healthy brain, and her work outlines how disruption of this crosstalk can play a role in brain aging and neurodegenerative disease. She also showed this role in pregnancy and fetal brain development, where immune disruption in the mother can be linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Another focus of her work has been on repurposing cancer immunotherapies such as PD-1 blockers to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. She is a highly cited academic with over 300 publications, appearing in highly ranked journals (Science, Nature medicine, Nature Neuroscience, Nature Cell Biology, Nature Rev. Neurology, Nature Rev. Neuroscience, Nature Rev. Immunology, Immunity, EMBO J., PlosMedicine, PNAS).

There are also plans to link to Addis Ababa, in neighboring Ethiopia to the north. The first segment, between Mombasa and Nairobi, opened passenger rail service in June 2017, and freight rail service in January 2018. Other segments are under construction or planned. The new Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), is intended to replace the old, inefficient metre-gauge railway system. Location The railway system consists of several major sections: ; Mombasa‚ÄìNairobi Section This section, measuring , is known as the Mombasa‚ÄìNairobi Standard Gauge Railway, and connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. Passenger rail services between Mombasa and Nairobi started on 1 June 2017, and freight rail services on 1 January 2018. It was built between October 2016 and January 2018, by China Road and Bridge Corporation, at a cost of US$3.6 billion, 90 percent of which was borrowed from the Exim Bank of China, with the Kenyan government providing the remaining 10 percent. ; Nairobi‚ÄìNaivasha Section This section was also contracted to the company that constructed the Mombasa‚ÄìNairobi Section. The line stretches from Nairobi to Naivasha, a distance of about , at cost of KSh150 billion (US$1.5 billion), borrowed from the China Export-Import Bank. Construction began in 2018 and is expected to conclude in December 2019. International freight for neighbouring countries interchanges at the Naivasha Inland Container Depot. ; Naivasha‚ÄìKisumu Section This section, measuring , stretching from Naivasha to Kisumu, on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria, is contracted to China Communications Construction Company, at a budgeted cost of KSh380 billion (US$3.8 billion), borrowed from China Exim Bank. Loan papers between Kenya and China were scheduled for signatures in September 2018, but were deferred until a commercial viability study is conducted on the entire Mombasa‚ÄìKisumu railway. ; Kisumu‚ÄìMalaba Section This section, measuring approximately , takes the SGR line to the town of Malaba, at the international border with Uganda. CCCC, is the contractor for this section as well. The contract price for this section is about US$1.69 billion (KSh169 billion). The price for the Naivasha‚ÄìKisumu‚ÄìMalaba section is US$5.49 billion (KSh549 billion) and includes the laying of railway tracks in both sections, dredging and expansion of the port of Kisumu, and the expansion and modernization of the inland container depot at Embakasi, in Nairobi. ; Lamu‚ÄìLokichar-Nakodok Section Map showing the scope of the LAPSSET Project within Kenya This railway line, totaling , is a component of the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan- Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) development project. Under the LAPSSET plan, this line would be extended to Juba in South Sudan. ; Nairobi‚ÄìMoyale Section This section also falls under the LAPSSET program. It extends from Nairobi to Moyale, at the international border with Kenya's northern neighbor. It is planned to be extended to Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. ; Naivasha‚ÄìLokichar Section This proposed railway link, measuring an estimated , would link the two main standard gauge railway systems in Kenya; the Mombasa‚ÄìMalaba SGR System and the Lamu‚ÄìNakodok SGR System. Overview This 1435 mm (4 ft in) railway line is intended to ease the transfer of goods and passengers between the port of Mombasa and the cities of Nairobi and Kisumu, in Kenya, Kampala in Uganda, Kigali in Rwanda and subsequently to Bujumbura in Burundi, Juba in South Sudan and to Goma and Bunia in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In March 2019, during a state visit to Kenya, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and his host, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, jointly, publicly committed to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Kampala via Malaba.

The release proves to be divisive; on one hand, it leads to over 26 million downloads and an estimated 81 million people listening to the album within the first month; however, it also leads to concerns on the devaluation of the monetary value of music as a commercial product, and angers some iTunes customers due to its automatic download without the user's consent. A traditional commercial release occurs the following month, with the album debuting at number 9 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling just 28,000 copies, drastically lower than their prior release, No Line on the Horizon, which sold just under half a million copies in its first week of availability.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart- beat/6289335/florida-georgia-line-no-1-album-bob-seger-game-u2 =October= *Nickelback's single \\"Edge of a Revolution\\" tops the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart for two weeks.

It is one of the six cities (along with Lepreum, Macistus, Phrixae, Pyrgus, and Nudium) founded by the Minyans in the territory of Paroreatae and Caucones. At the beginning of the 5th century BCE, it was a community of perioeci of Elis. According to Xenophon, the Eleans claimed that they had bought the town from its owners for 30 talents; the identity of these \\"owners\\" is unknown. Xenophon's phrase suggests that at the time of the sale, Epeium was not controlled by its original population. It has been suggested that it belonged to the Arcadians. Towards the year 400 BCE, Epeium was liberated from the Elean government and made autonomous. It probably joined the Triphylian federation. In 369 BCE, it was a member of the Arcadian League. The site is tentatively located near modern Tripiti (formerly called Bitsibardi). Archaeologists have discovered the foundations of an old structure, a retaining wall and many tiles. The first researchers found walls of ashlar, ceramics of the Classical Period, and blocks and drums of columns. The acropolis occupies an area of 150 x 25 m (500 x 80 ft).

Based on the song of the same name, and inspired by the music of George Michael, the film stars Emilia Clarke as a disillusioned Christmas store worker who forms a relationship with a mysterious man (Henry Golding) and begins to fall for him; Thompson and Michelle Yeoh also star. Last Christmas was theatrically released in the United States on 8 November 2019 and in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2019 by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances and chemistry of Clarke and Golding but criticised the screenplay and plot twist. The film was a box office success, grossing $121 million worldwide. Plot Katarina \\"Kate\\", a young aspiring singer, works a dead-end job as an elf at a year-round Christmas shop in Central London, whose owner calls herself \\"Santa\\". She is homeless after being forced out by her flatmate. While at work, she notices a man outside staring upwards. She talks with him, learning that his name is Tom. After an unsuccessful singing audition, Kate sees Tom again and they go for a walk, where he charms her with his unusual observations of London. Upon isolating herself from her oldest friend, Kate is forced to return to her parents' home. Yugoslavian immigrants, her mother, Petra, suffers from depression and her father, Ivan, a former lawyer, works as a minicab driver as he can not afford to retrain to practice law in the United Kingdom. Kate feels suffocated by her mother, who dotes on her while ignoring Kate's sister, Marta, a successful lawyer. Kate begins spending more time with Tom, who rides a bike and volunteers at a homeless shelter, which she initially mocks. Looking for Tom, who says he keeps his phone in a cupboard and often disappears for days at a time, she begins helping at the shelter in the hope of running into him, but finds that the staff have never met him. While celebrating Marta's promotion, Kate spitefully outs Marta, a lesbian. She then runs into Tom, who takes her back to his apartment. Kate reveals that, a year earlier, she was seriously ill and had to have a heart transplant. Kate says she feels half dead and questions whether she has the talent to make it as a performer. After opening up to Tom, Kate tries to initiate sex, but he declines. After spending the night with Tom, Kate begins taking small steps to improve her life; taking care of her body, setting up Santa with a Danish man who loves Christmas as much as she does, apologising to Marta and her girlfriend, and singing Christmas songs to busk for money for the shelter. After a few days she runs into Tom again, who says he has something important to tell her, but she preemptively asserts he is fearful of commitment, and walks away. Kate continues to try to do good in her daily life. Finally, wanting to make amends with Tom, she returns to his apartment only to meet an estate agent who is holding viewings. After some initial confusion about who owns the flat, he reveals that the previous owner was killed in a bicycle accident last Christmas and the place has been vacant during the probate process. Finding his phone in the cupboard, Kate realises that Tom was the organ donor whose heart she received, and that all their interactions were either hallucinations or spiritual apparitions. Going to a small garden, which was Tom's favourite place, Kate encounters him again where he says his heart will always belong to her. The bench on which they sat during their first trip to the garden is revealed to be a memorial bench for Tom. For Christmas, Kate organises a show utilizing the talents of the people at the shelter and inviting all of her friends and family, including the newly coupled Santa and Danish man. Kate delicately performs a solo of the Wham! song, \\"Last Christmas,\\" intertwined with flashbacks of her so-called \\"encounters\\" with Tom until revelry ensues when the curtain rises and she is joined by the band of performers. Later, Kate and the family celebrate Christmas together joined by Alba, Marta's girlfriend, for the first time. The Christmas celebration fades out and a bright light transitions to a summer scene where a visibly healthier Kate is seen writing in her journal in the garden to which Tom introduced her. Smiling and visibly happy, Kate looks up, as Tom always advised. Cast In addition, Madison Ingoldsby and Lucy Miller portray the young Kate and Marta, respectively. Andrew Ridgeley, from the duo Wham!, whose song \\"Last Christmas\\" is instrumental to the plot, makes a cameo appearance in the audience at the end of the film. Production In September 2018, it was reported that Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding would star in a London-set romantic comedy taking place at Christmas, titled Last Christmas. Paul Feig was set to direct, with Emma Thompson co-writing the screenplay. In October, it was announced that Thompson would star as well, and that the film would feature the music of the late singer George Michael, including \\"Last Christmas\\", and previously unreleased tracks. In November 2018, Michelle Yeoh joined the cast of the film. Last Christmas was filmed from 26 November 2018 to February 2019. Filming locations included Piccadilly Circus, the Strand, Regent Street, the Thames Embankment, Covent Garden (where the Christmas shop is located), West London Film Studios, St Marylebone Parish Church and the Phoenix Garden. On 31 October 2019, Thompson and Wise published a collection of personal essays about the meaning of Christmas in a book also called Last Christmas. Contributors include Andy Serkis, Caitlin Moran, Olivia Colman and Emily Watson. The profits from the book went to two charities, Crisis and The Refugee Council. =Music= The musical score was composed by Theodore Shapiro. Back Lot Music has released the film score. An official soundtrack album was released by Sony Music on CD, two-disc vinyl, and digital formats on 8 November 2019. The album contains 14 Wham! and solo George Michael songs, as well as a previously unreleased song originally completed in 2015 titled \\"This Is How (We Want You to Get High)\\".

The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Likable leads, terrific behind-the-scenes talent, and an intriguing musical hook aren't enough to save Last Christmas from its poorly conceived story.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 3 out of 5 stars. Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a negative review and wrote, \\"It's twee, it's precious, it's forced.

History The group was founded in Munich in 2012 by Martin Simma, who then also took over the management, along with students Michael Hartinger, Korbinian Arendt, Christian Schild, Florian Claus, Stefan Raaflaub and Julian David. The band members come from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The group became known through two music videos, which they staged as if they were flash mobs, in which the band performed with a newly produced version of the song \\"Rock mi\\" (originally by the Alpenrebellen). One criticism that was repeatedly stated was that the band's image was predetermined by the music industry; this was reinforced by the group's appearances in Lederhosen, seemingly alpine style of music and the fact that all the band members except Julian David and Florian Claus Homepage von Florian Claus were prior to their involvement with Voxxclub primarily actors or musical actors.Profil Stefan RaaflaubBiographie Michael Hartinger Voxxclub with Florian Silbereisen at their last performance with Julian David on Die Besten im Sommer in 2015 Their debut album, Alpin, was released in March 2013 and reached the top 30 in Germany and Austria, which it held for several weeks. In Switzerland, it reached the top 50 for two weeks. The single \\"Rock mi\\" peaked at number 44 in both Germany and Austria and stayed on the German chart for 10 weeks, and on the Austrian chart for seven weeks. For Oktoberfest, the album was re-released with five additional songs and re- entered the charts, as did their single. The title \\"Rock mi\\" became in the interpretation of Voxxclub a popular song at the Oktoberfest. In 2014, Voxxclub was nominated for an Echo Music Prize in the Folk Music category. In the same year, the group released in Hamburg with Roland Spremberg the album Ziwui. The title of the album goes back to the Tyrolean folk song \\"Ziwui\\" (\\"The song of the bird catcher\\", also called \\"H√∂ttinger bird catcher song\\"), but is, except for the name, a completely new composition. In 2014, Voxxclub went on a solo tour in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and in the same year did the \\"Festival of festivals\\" tour. On May 4, 2015, members announced on their Facebook page that Julian David was leaving the band. In 2015, Voxxclub were again guests on the tour \\"Festival of Festivals - The party continues\\".

Montsoreau is a small city named after the mount Soreau on which is built the famous ch√¢teau de Montsoreau, the only ch√¢teau of the Loire Valley to have been built in the Loire riverbed. Montsoreau is listed among the most beautiful villages of France, and both the village and the ch√¢teau are part of the UNESCO listed world heritage site of the Loire valley. The Montsoreau Flea Market includes all year, a hundred professional merchants and is located in the vieux port district, on the banks of the Loire river.  History  Montsoreau is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Loire Valley, and is also listed among the Most Beautiful Villages of France. The flea market of Montsoreau was created in April 1990 by the municipality of Montsoreau in order to develop the commerce and tourism of this small city, and to take full advantage of the city scenery. The city of Montsoreau relied on a local network of antique dealers to define the periodicity (once a month, the second Sunday), and the identity of the event. The market organization relies still today on the antique dealers and elected of the village, one of its characteristics is to summon the second-hand dealers and antique dealers at 5.30 am the morning of the event, and to draw lots available locations on the vieux port docks.  France-Europe Antiques Quality Label  The Montsoreau flea market has received in 2006 the France-Europe Antiques Quality Label, and is one of the 52 events labeled in Europe. This label is issued by the SNCAO- GA (National Trade Union of Antiquity, Modern and Contemporary Art Galleries) and deposited at the INPI (National Institute of Intellectual Property) ) and WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) in Geneva.  Attendance  The event benefited from its image of authenticity of the goods, its direct environment of the Loire Valley landscapes, as well as the notoriety of its ch√¢teau to ensure immediately, since the 90s, attendance of 4000 visitors per event. In 2011, attendance stabilizes between 6,000 and 10,000 visitors per event, to today regularly exceed 10,000 visitors.

She had two older sisters, Letitia born in 1880, and Constance born in 1894 who died in infancy. Initially Overend was educated at home by a governess, then went on to Alexandra College, Dublin. Her philanthropy started at a young age, when at age 8 she organised a fete in aid of the Children's League of Pity, the junior division of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children which had been established by her mother. Overend worked alongside her mother at the Dundrum and Ballinteer District Nursing Association, taking over as president when her mother retired in 1962. Along with her older sister, Overend was a motor car enthusiast. In 1936 her mother gave her an Austin Tickford which she kept for the rest of her life, and a car that became well known around Dundrum and Dublin. Both sisters were members of the Irish Veteran and Vintage Car Club and the Leinster Motor Club. Overend developed an interest in cattle breeding at Airfield, particularly Jersey cattle. Her cattle were regular winners at the Royal Dublin Society annual spring show, with the cattle being recognisable by their Gilbert and Sullivan inspired names. Alongside her sister, Overend established the Airfield Trust to care for the farm and house, initially known as The Dromartin Trust. Overend travelled extensively with her sister, in Europe and internationally to India, Australia, and America. She was a keen skier, visiting Austria annually with friends until she was in her 60s.

He served as pastor of St. Augustine Church in Philadelphia for seventeen years, as vicar general of the American province of the Order of Saint Augustine, and as vicar general of the Diocese of Philadelphia.  Biography  Michael Hurley was born in 1780, the son of Thomas Hurley. Conflicting records indicate that he was either born in Ireland or the United States. Hurley's half-sister claimed that he was born in Philadelphia, while other accounts claim he was born in Ireland, as his father was married in Tipperary. If he had been born in Ireland, he would have been brought to America in his infancy, since city records list Thomas Hurley as an upholsterer on Third Street between Arch and Race Streets in 1785. Hurley had three brothers, John, Joseph, and Edward, who were all baptized at St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia. It is likely that Hurley's father intended that he enter the upholstery trade, due to the fact that Michael's name appears alongside his father's in the City Directory and is marked \\"paperhanger\\" at 16 Carter's Alley, the location of his father's business. This implies that he actually learned the trade. Despite his early exposure to the upholstery business, Hurley became the first aspirant in the new American province of the Order of Saint Augustine (Augustinians). In 1797, Hurley was sent from the United States to Rome for his religious formation and priestly training. In 1802, he was ordained a priest there. Following his ordination, Hurley was sent back to the United States, where he became an assistant curate to Father Matthew Carr, the pastor at St. Augustine Church in Philadelphia. With Carr's death on September 29, 1820, Hurley became the only Augustinian in Pennsylvania, and he assumed the role of the church's second pastor. In this role, he oversaw the building of the church to its completion in 1829, a project his predecessor had started. In 1822, Hurley was appointed the vicar general of the Augustinian American province, known at the time as the Province of Our Lady of Good Counsel, a role Carr had held before him. He remained as vicar general of the province until his death. Hurley was also appointed vicar general for the Diocese of Philadelphia during Bishop Henry Conwell's episcopate. Hurley was a friend of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, who commended him for converting a number of high profile people, including her sister-in-law, to Catholicism. When Philadelphia was afflicted with an epidemic of Asiatic cholera in July 1832, Hurley allowed the friary of Saint Augustine's and a building adjacent to it to be converted into hospital, as the existing hospitals of Philadelphia became overwhelmed by the number of patients. This makeshift hospital was overseen by one doctor, Hurley, and the Sisters of Charity. For this work, he received an honorable citation. Likewise, Hurley had earlier been praised by the local medical profession for his assistance in the 1805 yellow fever epidemic. While pastor, Hurley also said mass at the Belle-Air estate owned by Jane and John Rudolph in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania. Moreover, in 1830, he received into the steeple of St. Augustine's Church a historic duplicate of the Liberty Bell that was cast in the same foundry as the original Liberty Bell; this bell had hung in Independence Hall and had been rung with the Liberty Bell on July 4, 1776. A reputed orator, Hurley gave speeches at the consecration of Bishop Ambrose Mar√©chal and at the funeral of Bishop Michael Francis Egan. At one point, he was successful in having a clause removed from the New York State Constitution that Catholics regarded as offensive. Hurley died on May 14, 1837 in Philadelphia. He was succeeded as pastor of St. Augustine's by Father Patrick E. Moriarty in 1839. His funeral was presided over by Bishop Francis Kenrick, and he was buried in the vault beneath St. Augustine Church alongside Matthew Carr and other Augustinian friars.

Early career 240px J√©r√¥me du Sarrat, sieur de La Pierri√®re was originally from Gascony. He married Anne Houdan. He was a French officer and a deputy of Jacques Dyel du Parquet in the 1640s. On 21 November 1645 the Jesuit Charles Hempteau married du Parquet to Marie Bonnard of Paris. La Pierri√®re was one of the witnesses. The marriage seems to have been secret. Dispute with Governor General Poincy Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy was named captain general by the French West India Company on 5 January 1638 and was appointed the king's lieutenant general in the American islands on 25 February 1638. Poincy was a quarrelsome man and a harsh authoritarian and earned many enemies. The company therefore decided to terminate his commission and look for a replacement. No√´l Patrocles de Thoisy was named the King's lieutenant general of the American Islands on 20 February 1645. Poincy's nephew, Robert de Longvilliers, who was ready to embark at La Rochelle, was handed the order to be delivered personally to Poincy. Poincy received the order to return on 13 March 1645. In July 1645 he expelled the intendant general, Clerselier de Leumont, who retired to Guadeloupe, and sent his most troublesome opponents back to France. Thoisy left Le Havre on 2 September 1645. After stopping in Martinique and Guadeloupe he reached Saint Christophe on 25 November 1645. Neither Poincy nor Sir Thomas Warner, governor of the English part of the island, would let him land. On 28 November 1645 he returned to Guadeloupe. In January 1646 Thoisy, with the support of du Parquet, led an expedition against Poincy and captured Poincy's two nephews. Poincy's forces, supported by militia provided by Warner, then defeated the company from Martinique. Thoisy escaped to Guadeloupe. Du Parquet took refuge first with the Capuchins and then with the English governor, who promptly gave him up to Poincy. Interim governor of Martinique La Pierri√®re was interim governor of Martinique from February 1646 to January 1647 during the absence of du Parquet. De Poincy wanted to stir up the people of Martinique against Thoisy, and prepared a document that violently libelled Thoisy personally, and the company of which he was the instrument. He sent a captain Boutain of La Rochelle to Martinique with this document. Le Pierri√®re heard of it, and had Boutain seized and placed in irons, preventing any insurrection for the time being. Around this time Caribs massacred some Frenchmen from three ships who were cutting wood on Saint Lucia. La Pierri√®re captured three pirogues of Caribs, who declared that it was Caribs from Saint Vincent who had committed the crime. Poincy seems to have been implicated in this act of hostility to Martinique. There were two parties on the island. Neither wanted to pay dues to the company, but one remained attached to du Parquet, while the other led by a Parisian named Beaufort would not receive him when he returned unless he was named by the king rather than the company. Although the difference seems minor, tempers ran high. On 26 June 1646 some hotheads from Le Pr√™cheur cried in La Pierri√®re's presence that they would not pay any dues to the company, but La Pierri√®re did not respond to this declaration of mutiny. A few days later two of Poincy's emissaries arrived from Guadeloupe and said that the inhabitants of that island had taken up arms and in response governor Charles Hou√´l du Petit Pr√© had suppressed their rights. Again, La Pierri√®re said nothing. On 7 July 1646, thinking that his silence meant he supported them, some rebels plundered the stores of La Pr√™cheur merchants. On 10 July 1646 the house of Parquet's intendant, the sieur de Lesp√©rance, was burned with all its contents. Parquet's partisans and his wife Marie Bonnard were concerned by La Pierri√®re's equivocal attitude, which served to encourage the sedition. Le Fort decided the solution was to kill Beaufort and his fellows, and if necessary to kill La Pierri√®re. He went to La Pierri√®re and demanded to know whose side he was on. La Pierri√®re said he was on the side of Parquet but was powerless to act. He promised to do what Le Fort proposed. Le Fort told him that the next day, 6 August, Beaufort would arrive with his co-rebels and force him to sign a document. He should do so, then propose that they drink the health of the king. While they were doing so he should give the sign, and Le Fort's men would fall on them. Everything happened as predicted. Beaufort arrived with twenty accomplices. After signing the document and drinking a toast to the king, La Pierri√®re raised his gun as if to fire into the air, then lowered it, fired at Beaufort's head and killed him. At this signal Le Fort's men burst into the house and killed the others. La Pierri√®re sent word of what had happened to Guadeloupe the next day. Thoisy sent an officer to Martinique who published a general amnesty dated 23 September 1646 for everyone who had been involved in the recent disturbances. Le Pierriere again took an oath to the king and his lieutenant general Thoisy. On 16 and 28 October 1646 the king ordered Poincy and Thoisy to exchange prisoners, thus implicitly giving Poincy an amnesty for his revolt since he was opposed to the company and its abuses rather than opposed to the king. In November 1646 Hou√´l started a revolt against Thoisy, claiming that his presence on Guadeloupe deprived him of his rights as governor. Thoisy managed to end the revolt on 22 November with a display of friendship for Hou√´l. Thoisy heard that he was to be assassinated, and on 31 December 1646 embarked for Martinique, which he reached on 3 January 1647. Poincy sent five ships and 800 men to seize Thoisy. During the night of January 16‚Äì17 1647 a council was held on Martinique in the home of Marie Bonnard du Parquet, the governor's wife, in which it was decided to arrest Thoisy. A resolution was drawn up and signed by La Pierri√®re, de Rossillon, de la Renardi√®re, de Beaujeu, de la Haye and Lefort, who was to make the arrest. De le Housaye's name was added with a note that he had not signed because he did not know how to write. On 17 January 1647 Thoisy was arrested and delivered to Poincy's men in exchange for Du Parquet. Du Parquet was released on 6 February. He returned to Martinique on 9 February 1677. Later career Around the start of 1654 the master of a ship subjected a Carib of Saint Vincent to a severe punishment on the pretext that one of his sailors had been murdered. The Caribs took this as sufficient cause to declare war against the French. The few French who were living on Saint Vincent were killed. Parquet embarked 150 men on three ships under La Pierri√®re, who descended on Saint Vincent and for eight days attacked the Caribs and pillaged, burned or destroyed all they could lay their hands on before returning the Martinique. Hostilities then broke out on Martinique, where the Caribs at first gained the upper hand before being driven back to the eastern part of the island. In the second half of 1672 the French Governor General Jean-Charles de Baas learned of the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War, and began to organize an expedition against the Dutch base on Cura√ßao. He led the expedition against Cura√ßao early in 1673. The assault failed and on 18 March 1763 he ordered a retreat. During their stay at Tortuga after the failed expedition Baas appointed La Pierri√®re acting governor in April 1673 the absence of Bertrand d'Ogeron de La Bou√´re(fr). Baas thought that d'Ogeron had died in Puerto Rico and on 16 April 1673 appointed Pierriere in his place. Ogeron soon returned and took charge again.

The film had its premiere in Warsaw, Poland on 17 August 2018. It was released in the UK on the 7 September 2018. Plot The pilots of No. 303 Squadron RAF, are a group of Polish fliers who have escaped from Europe, following the Nazi invasions of Poland and France, to join the Royal Air Force. Canadian RAF pilot John Kent, who became known as 'Kentowski' (Milo Gibson) has his work cut out for him when he's handed the angry and often maligned squadron to command. Piloting Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft, 303 Squadron works through language barriers, cultural differences and their grief on the loss of loved ones to become highly effective in the Battle of Britain. At the conclusion of the film, the Polish pilots are told that they will be repatriated to Communist Poland. Cast * Iwan Rheon as Jan Zumbach * Milo Gibson as John A.

In late 2017 and early 2018 some scenes were shot on the Kent coast at Stone Bay and Victoria Gardens in Broadstairs. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film (as Mission of Honor) has an approval rating of 83% based on reviews from 6 critics, with an average rating of 5.67/10. The Review in The Guardian was mixed with a 3/5 star rating. Leslie Felperin made this concluding comment: \\"The lack of budget, relative to Dunkirk at least, is glaring in the aerial dogfights, and the score is too maudlin and on the nose, but director David Blair navigates the whole thing through the storm with watchable competence\\".

It is related to maternal feminism.  Definition  The idea of motherhood studies was influenced by Adrienne Rich‚Äôs Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution in 1976. It consists of three interconnected categories of inquiry: motherhood as institution, motherhood as experience, and motherhood as identity or subjectivity. Motherhood studies is often referred to as a feminist practice. Feminist mothering critiques the sexist and patriarchal values that contemporary society upholds. Part of feminist mothering is maternal activism. Feminist mothering also involves mothers reinventing or reconstructing their own mothering practice to minimize inequality in the domestic division of labor, to increase their autonomy, leisure, waged work as well as paid and unpaid leave.Bueskens, Petra, (2018). Modern Motherhood and Women's Dual Identities: Rewriting the Sexual Contract, Routledge, Like maternal feminism, feminist mothering also involves a feminist politics of birth, breastfeeding and embodied attachment to children. It is the extension of an ethic of care to children and beyond that to society.  History  Samira Kawash argues that \\"the marginalization of motherhood in feminist thought was not only a political rejection of maternalist politics construed as a conservative backlash to feminism\\". One of the leading portals of mother studies is The m/other voices foundation, a non- profit organization in The Netherlands. It emerged in 2014 from Deirdre M. Donoghue's research project (m)other voices: the maternal as an attitude, maternal thinking and the production of time and knowledge at Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art. The project's purpose was to initiate discourse and the doing of maternal theory within arts and other fields of cultural production and to reflect on the maternal figure as a thinker and a producer of knowledge. More and more organized initiatives within academic communities are starting such as the Motherhood Initiative for Research and Community Involvement, a feminist scholarly and activist organization on mothering- motherhood based in Toronto, Canada. The Journal of the Motherhood Initiative re-launched in 2010 as a continuation of the Journal of the Association for Research on Mothering that started in 1999.

Rowing career Steffes-Mies was born in 1967. His father is the rower Josef Steffes- Mies who was part of the West German contingent on the United Team of Germany at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Steffes-Mies junior joined the Mainzer RV. At a height of and a weight of he had a good physical stature for a rowing career. At the 1988 national German rowing championships he won bronze with his coxed four team. A year later, he became German champion in this boat class alongside Dirk Balster, Ansgar Wessling, Roland Baar, and Manfred Klein as cox. The five teamed up with the coxless four that won the national champions and as an eight, they won a second national title in 1989. They were thus nominated as the German eight (\\"Deutschland Achter\\") that would contest the 1989 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Yugoslavia, where they won gold. In 1990, Steffes-Mies again won the German championships in the coxed four and the eight, with Frank Richter having replaced Wessling in both boats and Frank Dietrich being the only member of the 1989 coxless four still in the team. That eight defended its world championship title at the 1990 World Rowing Championships in Tasmania, Australia. In 1991, Steffes-Mies won the German championships in the eight for the third consecutive year. J√ºrgen Hecht and Wolfgang Klapheck, who had won the national coxless pair title, joined the eight for the 1991 World Rowing Championships in Vienna, Austria; for the third consecutive year they brought home the world championship title. This was the first year that they represented a reunified Germany. In 1992, Steffes-Mies was chosen as a reserve for the German eight for the Barcelona Olympics. The Olympic team members could not contest the German nationals as dates overlapped. The German eight won a bronze medal but Steffes-Mies did not get to compete. He commented 20 years later that having missed out competing at the Olympics brings back painful memories. In 1993, Steffes-Mies was back with the eight that won the German championships. The same team then won gold at the 1993 World Rowing Championships at Raƒçice in the Czech Republic. In 1994, Steffes-Mies won his last German championship with the eight. At the 1994 World Rowing Championships at Indianapolis, United States, he came fourth with his team. Since March 2014, Steffes-Mies has been president of the Mainzer RV. Professional career Steffes-Mies studied engineering management with a view of taking over his father's construction and road building company. After finishing his degree, he spent a year working at Hochtief. During the next year working for a local road building company, he was promoted to construction manager. In deviation from his original plan, he became a management consultant with strategy consulting firm Roland Berger. He then worked for prefabricated house manufacturer Kampa where he joined the board. In 2005, he did take over his father's company and immediately amalgamated it with the company of a business partner; the joint company had 350 employees. In October 2010, they sold their company to the construction company Strabag. Private life Steffes-Mies is married with three children.

He is an American cultural and political anthropologist, ethnographer, historian, writer, and labor union researcher who writes about sanctuary city politics, immigration, governmental power, policy, social movements, and culture.  Biography  Mancina holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Economy and Social Movements from The Evergreen State College, as well as a Master of Arts degree and a Ph.D. in Anthropology from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. Mancina is a former United States National Science Foundation grantee and Wenner-Gren Foundation grantee. From 2013-2017, Mancina was Researcher for Service Employees International Union Local 1021 in San Francisco. In 2018 he became Research Associate at the University of Oxford Centre for Criminology and review editor for the Border Criminologies blog. Mancina is also well known for his social media activism to intervene in the public debate on sanctuary cities and regularly provides news and analysis on the topic to a Twitter following of over 25,000. Originally from Kansas City, Kansas, United States, Mancina lives in Budapest, Hungary with his partner Zina Bozzay, a musician and composer, and their two daughters.  Academic Work  As a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology at Vanderbilt University, Mancina was trained as a Mayanist under the supervision of cultural and economic anthropologist Edward F. Fischer and studied politics, social movements, and Maya culture in rural Tzeltal-Maya towns in Chiapas, Mexico. His first professional work examined the lives of Tzeltal-Maya migrants in San Francisco, California and returned migrants in Chiapas. This transnational work charted the effect of their migration and day labor incomes in the U.S. upon development and politics in their towns of origin in Mexico. Mancina has conducted ethnographic field research and archival research on the creation and implementation of San Francisco, California's sanctuary city policies. This has included interviews with sanctuary movement leaders, organizers, activists, and public officials; and \\"participant observation\\" with sanctuary movement organizations and sanctuary city policy advocacy groups. Part of this work has included conducting research in San Francisco City Hall and working as a constituent services staff member for sanctuary city law author District Supervisor David Campos. In this capacity, his participant observation work has included assisting undocumented city residents in seeking city services in a manner which itself was governed by sanctuary city laws. His sanctuary city- focused research has also included assisting a coalition of immigrant-serving non-profits and legal organizations called the San Francisco Immigrant Rights Defense Committee, now renamed FREESF in drafting and advocating for sanctuary city laws. From this research, Mancina wrote a comprehensive history of San Francisco, California's sanctuary city laws. Mancina has also been cited in media outlets covering sanctuary city and sanctuary state political and legal developments. Mancina is heavily influenced by critical theory, continental philosophy, the work of Michel Foucault, governmentality studies, and anthropological work in subfields of political anthropology known as the \\"anthropology of the state\\" and the \\"anthropology of policy.\\"  Selected bibliography  * (2019). ‚ÄúSanctuary Cities and Sanctuary-Power: Governmental Strategy for a Borderless World.‚Äù In Reece Jones (ed.)

The massacre was carried out as retaliation for partisans' action in Papuk.  Background  On 12 January 1942, in a direct fight between the Partisans and the Usta≈°e, five Usta≈°e were killed, and two wounded, one of whom died later. The Partisans withdrew to Papuk, and Usta≈°e returned to Voƒáin and waited for reinforcements from Osijek, Beli≈°ƒáe and Virovitica.  Massacre  On 13 January, some 300 Usta≈°e and Domobran soldiers began with plundering and burning Serbian houses. Civilians who tried to escape or provided resistance were killed and all others were arrested and taken to Voƒáin. On Serbian New Year, January 14, the biggest slaughter of the innocent population in Slavonia at that time started. Almost all the male inhabitants of the villages Jorgiƒái, Zuboviƒái, Dobriƒái, Kometnik and Sekulinci were killed. During the massacre, a total of 350 civilians were killed. = Acts of individual heroism = In addition to the victims, some managed to save many Serbs from Voƒáin and its surroundings. The Croat gendarme sergeant Luke Mustafiƒá managed to save the lives of 10 Serbs during the massacre.  Aftermath  On the following day, Usta≈°e transported Serb corpses to a mass grave that was excavated east of Voƒáin, along the Voƒáinka river. The most significant consequence of this crime was strengthening of the partisan movement in the area of Voƒáin and Podravska Slatina, exactly the opposite effect of what NDH's authorities tried to achieve. Although during 1941 and early 1942 there were not many local residents in favor of active resistance, due to increasing existential threat, a large number of Serbs from the surrounding villages joined the partisan units. A memorial to the victims of this massacre was erected in 2007.

Goodacre is a research geneticist and Professor of Evolutionary Biology and Genetics at the University of Nottingham. She is the lead for the Open Air Laboratories, a citizen science project that engages people with the outdoor environment and Deputy Director of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Doctoral Training Programme .  Education  Goodacre studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at the University of Cambridge as a student of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating in 1995. Goodacre joined the University of Nottingham for her graduate studies and earned her PhD in 1999 for studies on the evolution of Partula land snails.  Career  Goodacre joined the University of Oxford as a research fellow in 1999. She was a research fellow at the University of East Anglia from 2002. She was described by the BBC as Spider Woman. , Goodacre is based at the University of Nottingham, where she founded the SpiderLab in 2007 and leads the ArachNotts research group. As a geneticist, Goodacre studies the evolution, population and conservation of spiders. She monitored the mating behaviour and sex ratio of the linyphiid spider Pityohyphantes phrygianus with Bengt Gunnarsson at the University of Gothenburg. She also studied the silk of Mygalomorphae spiders and the genetic diversity of spider silk genes and found evidence for antimicrobial activity in the silk of common house spiders. She found that Erigone atra, a pest controlling spider, uses long-distance airborne dispersal. Goodacre contributed to the 2011 book Spider Physiology and Behaviour: Physiology. In 2015 Goodacre reported that spiders could survive \\"sailing\\" across oceans. ArachNotts study the diving bell spider and its silk, which it uses to build a diving bell in which it stores air underwater, and have so far identified some of the silk genes used by this spider. They also work on the relationship between spiders and the microbes that they carry with them, including the mating behaviour and sex-ratio of offspring, the ecology and biological control potential of spiders in agriculture and the use of genetic tools in the conservation of the endangered raft spider. Goodacre worked alongside chemists at the University of Nottingham to create functionalised spider silk that could be used for drug delivery, wound healing and regenerative medicine. This involved attaching fluorescent dyes and antibiotics by click chemistry to silk synthesised by Escherichia coli. The intention is this synthetic silk can slowly deliver antibiotics or be used as a scaffold to grow new tissues. She has patented the synthesised silk (functionalised spidroin). Goodacre created the app Spider in da House. She works to make people to be less frightened of spiders, as well as engaging the public in improving the UK's biodiversity. In June 2017, Goodacre took the SpiderLab to a series of primary schools, working in partnership with the Zoological Society of London. She appears regularly on the BBC. She has contributed to The Conversation, The Guardian and serves as an editor of both PeerJ and Heredity .

Investigations into Burisma and Zlochevsky In 2012, Viktor Pshonka, the Ukrainian prosecutor general, began investigating Burisma Holdings owner, Zlochevsky, over allegations of money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption during 2010‚Äì2012. In early November 2014 Deutsche Bank reported that $24 million of funds from his companies were wired from Cyprus to the Latvia branch of PrivatBank, a Ukrainian bank. In April 2014, the Serious Fraud Office froze approximately $23 million belonging to companies controlled by Zlochevsky. At the end of 2014, Zlochevsky fled Ukraine amid allegations of unlawful self enrichment and legalization of funds (Article 368-2, Criminal Code of Ukraine) during his tenure in public office.Liliya Hryshko.

At the end of January 2015, the Central Criminal Court in London released the $23 million that were blocked on accounts of Zlochevsky due to inadequate evidence. In June 2018, the Serious Fraud Office stated that the case was closed. Zlochevsky returned to Ukraine in February 2018 after investigations into his Burisma Holdings had been completed in December 2017 with no charges filed against him. On 18 April 2018, an alleged recording of part of a conversation between President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko and fugitive Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Onyshchenko was released by Onyshchenko which implicated Zlochevsky in graft. On 15 June 2018, after the Solomyansky District Court in Kyiv had annulled the ruling of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor‚Äôs Office (SAP) to close a criminal proceeding against him in 2017, Zlochevsky was accused of having illegally issued, while he was Ecology Minister in 2010‚Äì2012, oil and gas licenses to the companies that belonged to him. According to Ukrainian authorities Zlochevsky is suspected of \\"theft of government funds on an especially large scale\\". Authorities said the criminal investigation on suspicion of embezzlement is currently on hold because Zlochevsky whereabouts cannot presently be determined.

Early life The son of count Marco Aurelio Capra and Ippolita Dalla Croce, Baldassarre came from a family of the ancient nobility but somewhat reduced circumstances. His father was an amateur doctor, and in 1594 he moved to Padua with his son so that he could study medicine, astronomy and mathematics. To support them, Marco Aurelio gave fencing lessons. One of his students was Galileo himself, introduced by their mutual acquaintance Giacomo Alvise Cornaro.Clelia Pighetti, Il vuoto e la quiete. Scienza e mistica nel '600: Elena Cornaro e Carlo Rinaldini, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2005, p. 27. Kepler's Supernova In Padua Capra met Simon Mayr, an astronomer who was a pupil of Tycho Brahe, with whom he studied mathematics. On 10 October 1604, together Mayr, Capra observed a new star (now known as Kepler's supernova) which had been seen for the first time by the friar Ilario Altobelli, who had written to Galileo about his important discovery.Unione Astrofili Italiani Title page of Galileo's Dialogo in perpuosito de la stella Nuova (1605) In three public lectures, Galileo used the discovery of the new star to challenge the ideas of the Peripatetic philosophers of Padua, who held the Aristotelian view that the sphere of the stars was unchangeable. Capra was offended by Galileo's failure to acknowledge him as the person who had discovered the star, and, encouraged by Mayr, in 1605 he published a pamphlet attacking Galileo's position, entitled Consideratione astronomica circa la nova et portentosa Stella che nell'anno 1604 a d√¨ 10 ottobre apparse. Among his conclusions, Capra noted that in 1572 a similar new star (Tycho's supernova) had appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was significant, he argued, that the interval between the two stars' appearance was the same as the number of years in the life of Jesus Christ. As both were situated among the fixed stars, their appearance must denote something of great significance.G. Abetti, Amici e nemici di Galileo, pp. 98‚àí99. Galileo did not respond to this provocation, but he scribbled marginal notes in his copy of it with terms such as \\"bue\\" (\\"ox\\") and \\"coglione\\" (\\"balls\\"), deriding him for his ignorance of both Italian and of Latin.G. Gliozzi, op. cit Then, concealing his identity behind the pseudonym 'Cecco di Ronchitti', he responded to Antonio Lorenzini and his pamphlet Discorso intorno alla Nuova Stella (Padua, 1605) in a caustic pamphlet entitled Dialogo de Cecco di Ronchitti da Bruzene in perpuosito de la stella Nuova, written in the ancient dialect of Padua (called \\"dialetto pavano\\").. Plagiarism accusation against Galileo Capra‚Äôs second confrontation with Galileo was sufficiently serious for Galileo to decide he needed to confront it openly. In 1602 Capra and his father had asked Galileo to let them observe how his proportional compass worked - although Galileo had not invented the instrument, he had made it much easier to use and had devised new applications for it. In 1605 the Capras had borrowed a Galilean compass for a time from their friend Giacomo Alvise Cornaro, and they spent time at the workshop of Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni, the craftsman who made Galileo‚Äôs instruments for him. By these means they were able to learn how the compass was made. In 1607 Baldassarre Capra published the tract Usus et fabrica circini cuiusdam proportionis, per quem omnia fere tum Euclidis, tum mathematicorum omnium problemata facile negotio resolvitur, which was more or less a translation into Latin of Galileo‚Äôs 1606 work Le operazioni del compasso geometrico et militare. Capra dedicated the work to Cornaro and used it to claim that he had invented the proportional compass himself.G. Gliozzi, op. cit. Galileo had successfully defended himself against a previous charge of plagiarism fought against him in 1602 by a Flemish mathematician, so he could not afford to take Capra‚Äôs claims lightly. He therefore asked for the matter to be adjudicated by the rectors of the university. The hearing During the hearing, Galileo was able to demonstrate not only that he had not copied Capra‚Äôs work, but that Capra had copied his work, and where he had introduced original material of his own, he had introduced errors. The testimony of Galileo‚Äôs friend Paolo Sarpi was crucial to the hearing, and he declared that Galileo had given him a compass as early as 1597. In the face of this, Capra stated that he was willing to apologise for his unfounded allegation of plagiarism by publishing a book in which he would acknowledge the offence caused to Galileo. Galileo refused however, wanting to give the widest possible publicity to Capra's eventual condemnation. The hearing continued and Capra's position was further weakened when he refused to demonstrate to the tribunal how the compass was used. The rectors found him guilty and ordered that all copies of his book were to be destroyed, though some had already been sent outside the Republic of Venice. Galileo published their verdict in his favour, as well as a tract entitled Difesa contro alle calunnie et imposture di Baldessar Capra (Venice, 1607), which showed how Capra's accusations were false. Galileo apparently believed that it had been Simon Mayr who had instigated Capra's false claim, and in his great work The Assayer he accused Mayr of having translated his instructions on the compass into Latin and then having them printed using Capra's name.G. Abetti, cit., p. 101. After the hearing Capra left Padua and returned to Milan where he continued to teach the use of the compass. His disgrace was apparently not forgotten however, as in 1620 he was refused admission into the city's College of Medicine.

He is most noted for his 1954 novel Mist on the River, which has been described as the first Canadian novel ever to present a realistic portrait of First Nations people as its central characters. Evans was born in Vankleek Hill, Ontario, the son of Frances Taylor and William Evans, a teacher. He was raised in Galt.. He briefly worked as a journalist before enlisting in the Canadian Armed Forces during World War I, and after the war he settled at Roberts Creek, British Columbia. His first novel, The New Front Line, was published in 1927. Throughout his career, he also published poetry, short stories, theatrical and radio plays, juvenile and young adult literature, and non- fiction writing on First Nations culture and nature and conservation topics. He is best known for his novel, Mist on the River (1954) which was based on his experience with the Gitxsan people of the Skeena valley. The book interweaves the stories of six members of the same family including the central character who will eventually become chief. The book was reissued as part of the New Canadian Library series in 1973, with a foreword by W. H. New. His final novel, O Time in Your Flight, was published in 1979, by which time Evans was nearly blind. When the BC Book Prizes were established in 1985, the award for non-fiction was named the Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize in his honour. Hubert Evans: The First 93 Years, a biography of Evans by writer Alan Twigg, was published in early 1986, and Evans died, aged 94, in June of that year.

A 200-acre hub for technology and biological science research, development, and commercialization, Cortex is a main location for the city's technology startup companies. It is near Washington University's medical campus, St. Louis University, and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Cortex officials say their master plan calls for $2.3 billion of construction, producing more than 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use development to house 13,000 jobs in technology. Cortex 3.0, a $170 million expansion, was to be complete in fall 2018.  History  In 1998, William Henry Danforth, former chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis, sought to help the region better build upon its strengths in medicine and plant sciences. He formed the Coalition for Plant and Life Sciences, now known as BioSTL, which led to the creation of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. Danforth and John Dubinsky, CEO of financial consulting firm Westmoreland Associates and the eventual chairman of the Cortex board, went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to study Kendall Square, a noted innovation district, to see how the concept could be used in St. Louis. The idea was to create a district where companies could have access to talent, new technology, labs, and intellectual property. The Midtown neighborhood was selected because the founding institutions are nearby and millennials wanted to live and work in the nearby urban areas. In 2002, Cortex was founded as a 501(c) 3 tax-exempt organization by Washington University, BJC HealthCare (BJC), University of Missouri ‚Äì St. Louis (UMSL), St. Louis University (SLU), and the Missouri Botanical Garden. These founders contributed a total of $29 million to buy land and serve as collateral for loans: Washington University, $15 million; BJC and SLU, $5 million apiece; and UMSL, $4 million. The Cortex West Redevelopment Corporation was classified by the city under Missouri statute Chapter 353 as a master developer of the district. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay allowed Cortex to redevelop the area broadly in the \\"public interest\\" by issuing tax abatements and using eminent domain. Cortex hired CEO Dennis Lower, who executed a plan called Cortex 2.0 and converted the district from strictly bioscience to an open mixed-used district and added support for startup technology companies. In summer 2014, Square, the payments company set up by St. Louis natives Jim McKelvey and Jack Dorsey, opened offices at Cortex 4240. In 2015, Ikea opened in Cortex. In 2018, Microsoft opened its first Midwest headquarters in Cortex building 4220. In fall 2018, once Venture Cafe Innovation Hall opens at the 4220 Building in Cortex, 23 City Blocks Hospitality Group's restaurant and cafe, The Chocolate Pig will open. In June 2018, AON announced it would move 200 employees to the 4220 building. In March 2020, Washington University School of Medicine announced the construction of a new $616 million, 11 story, 609,000-square-foot neuroscience research building which will sit at the eastern edge of the Medical Campus in the Cortex Innovation Community. Construction of the building is set to be finished in 2023. One of the primary companies building Cortex is Wexford, which had as of 2018 developed three properties and a total of 536,903 square feet.

He is known for beating famous German artist Thomas Schweicker in a duel that cost the artist both arms.  Early life  Von Williamsburg was born in the small town of Judenburg Austria to Johannes von Williamsburg and Eva Graf. His father Johannes von Williamsburg was a noble and landowner around the town. His mother was his father's second wife after his first wife died from an unknown illness. Von Williamsburg moved with his family to the German town of Schw√§bisch Hall in 1544 after a small fire damaged a portion of his family's estate.  Duel  In 1561, von Williamsburg challenged German artist Thomas Schweicker to a duel over a female named Kirsten Engel that both wanted to court. Schweicker was unaware of von Williamsburg's aptitude with swordfighting and was swiftly defeated. Schweicker lost both arms during the duel and was left for dead, but was brought back to Schw√§bisch Hall by spectators where a doctor cauterized his wounds and saved his life. Decades after the duel, Schweicker apologized to von Williamsburg. The two reconciled and became good friends. After Schweicker's death in October of 1602, von Williamsburg was distraught. He attended Schweiker's funeral and burial, and paid for the expenses and burial plot.  Personal life  Days after his duel with Schweicker, von Williamsburg proposed to Kirsten Engel and the two wedded several months later. Von Williamsburg‚Äôs father Johannes paid for the construction of a small estate in the countryside surrounding Schw√§bisch Hall which was completed the following winter. In February of 1564, the couple‚Äôs son Wilhelm was born. After his father Johannes fell ill in the fall of 1582, Noah von WIlliamsburg became the lord. On February 8th, 1583, Johannes von Williamsburg died from an unknown illness. Historians speculate that the illness was a cancer of the lungs known as small-cell carcinoma.

Completed in 1938, she was assigned to the Baltic Fleet and played a minor role in the 1939‚Äì1940 Winter War when the Soviet Union invaded Finland. A few days after the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) in June 1941, the ship struck a German mine and was badly damaged. After taking off the survivors, the Soviets failed to sink Gnevny with gunfire before they withdrew and the abandoned wreck drifted until she was sunk by German bombers three days later.

Commonly used on air- cooled engines, the head temperature gauge displays the work that the engine is performing more quickly than an oil or water temperature gauge. As the engine works at high speed or uphill, head temperature will increase quickly. The meter can be digital or analog. An air-cooled engine requires a steady flow of air for cooling. Unlike water cooled engine, air cooled engines have no thermostat. Over temperature can cause engine failure. Air-cooled engine are used in aircraft engine control and other air-cooled engines as in cars and air-cooled motorcycles.National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Safety Recommendation A-12-007, Engine cylinder assemblies that fail A cylinder from an air-cooled aviation engine, a Continental C85. Notice the rows of fins on both the steel cylinder barrel and the aluminum cylinder head. The fins provide additional surface area for air to pass over the cylinder and absorb heat. Flat-four aircraft engine The CHT senders usually has a K-type thermocouple that is mounted under the spark plug. The K-type thermocouple is pair of two dissimilar metals that produce a small voltage signal when heated. The metal closest to the spark plug is called the hot junction and the other close to the head cold junction. The ring under the spark plug is used to transfer the heat from the plug to the thermocouple. The gauge and cold junction are usually calibrated at room temperature . Because the thermocouple is calibrated for room temperature, the gauge readings will only be 100% accurate at that engine compartment temperature. If the engine compartment temperature is colder the CHT temperature will display higher. If the engine compartment temperature is higher the reading will be lower. The error can be fixed with a cold-junction compensating thermistor, which measures the temperature at the cold junction so the gauge can adjust the reading. Low budget gauges do not have this compensating thermistor.

She is known for her research and work on play therapy, social therapy, and criticism of the medical model of mental health. She was instrumental in introducing the ideas of Lev Vygotsky to the fields of psychotherapy, organizational and community development. In 2014, Holzman received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cultural-Historical Research Special Interest Group of the American Educational Research Association. Holzman is the author or co-author of multiple books including The overweight brain: How our obsession with knowing keeps us from getting smart enough to make a better world (2018), Vygotsky at work and play (2009), Performing psychology: A postmodern culture of the mind (1999), and Psychological investigations: A clinician's guide to social therapy (2003). She and Newman co-authored the widely cited volume Lev Vygotsky: Revolutionary scientist (1993) and The end of knowing: A new developmental way of learning (1997).  Biography  Holzman received her Bachelor of Arts in English from Rhode Island College in 1967. She continued her education studying Linguistics at Columbia University and Brown University. She completed her PhD in Development Psychology and Psycholinguistics at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1977. As a graduate student, Holzman conducted research on the development of causal language and the role of imitation in language development with Lois Bloom (publishing under the name Lois Hood). After graduation, Holzman completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Rockefeller University where she worked with Michael Cole, and later joined the faculty of Empire State College, SUNY. Holzman visited the Institute of Psychology in Moscow in 1980 to study the work of Vygotsky and his followers. In 1985, Holzman and Fred Newman founded the East Side Institute for Group and Short Term Psychotherapy, which promotes humanistic approaches to psychotherapy. Together they introduced social therapeutics as a form of group therapy to help people solve problems. The East Side Institute became an international education, training and research center for social therapeutics. In 2010, she became the chair of Global Outreach at the All Stars Project, which helps create opportunities for positive youth development. Using play to mitigate potentially hostile relationships between the police and young people of color, The All Stars Project introduced Operation Conversation: Cops and Kids to the training of NYPD police officers. Operation Conversation invites police officers and young people to improvise a scene that doesn't relate to them, but allows them to play and talk freely, and get to know each other in a relaxed, playful context. Afterward, they can sit down and talk to each other about their hardships and how they would like to be treated by one another and find common ground. Holzman was involved in the development of educational programming at the Barbara Taylor School and Performance of a Lifetime. She is the chair and chief organizer of the Performing the World bi-annual conference, which supports performance activism and emerging social change. In 2018, she became a Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Vygotskian Practice and Performance at Lloyd International Honors College, The University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

Honzik received the American Psychological Association G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contributions to Developmental Psychology in 1983. She was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1984.  Biography  Honzik was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to an American family on May 14, 1908. She expressed interest in infant and child development from an early age; her interests were formed by observations of cross-cultural differences in the treatment of children in African and European families. Honzik moved to California in 1927 to attend University of California, Berkeley, where she obtained her bachelor's degree in Psychology in 1930. She also obtained her Master of Arts at University California, Berkeley in 1933. After a two-year fellowship at the National Child Research Center in Washington, DC, she returned to her studies at Berkeley, where she completed a PhD in Psychology in 1936. While in graduate school, she married a fellow student, Charles H. Honzik, who studied maze learning in rats. Honzik spent most of her career employed as a research assistant at the Institute Child Welfare, Berkeley. As described by Elliot Turiel, the Institute was a place where women were able to find positions in psychology during a time when women were not hired as faculty. Honzik's research, funded by the National Science Foundation, included a 50-year study of parenting. From 1952-1960, Honzik taught at Mills College as a lecturer in Child Development. Honzik remained affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley until her retirement in 1980.  Research  Honzik's research explored human development over the lifespan. Several of her most influential papers aimed to measure growth in the mental abilities of infants over the first year of life through brain development and changes in observable behaviors. She conducted pioneering work investigating developmental outcomes of infants with perinatal conditions, such as anoxia (oxygen deficiency). Honzik conducted a landmark longitudinal study of parenting behaviors in relation to their children's mental abilities, assessed from age 21 months to 30 years. This study was one of the first to document gender differences in the environmental factors associated with mental growth over time. Honzik co-authored, with J. W. Macfarlane and L. Allen, a widely cited monograph, published in 1954 and titled A developmental study of the behavior problems of normal children between 21 months and 14 years. Their study aimed to determine frequencies of a wide variety of behavioral problems in a normative sample. These included sleep disturbances, nail biting, speech problems, lying, stealing, selfishness, shyness, and many other potentially problematic behaviors. Honzik co-edited the book Present and past in middle life, published in 1981. This volume reported longitudinal research findings from the Oakland Growth Study (ages 11 to 50), and the Berkeley Guidance Study (ages birth to age 42). The topics covered included the development of personality, intelligence, and health from adolescence through middle age. Other collaborative research focused on adolescent health and personality in relation to midlife health outcomes, and linked teenage personality traits, i.e., having \\"a calm, controlled personality\\" to later health. In this study, Honzik and her colleagues documented gender differences in developmental trajectories. For women, but not for men, measures of health taken in adolescence were predictive of health ratings in middle age.  Representative publications  * Honzik, M. P. (1957).

Two systems are in common use, based on the abbreviations lists of standard reference works: * The Oxford Classical Dictionary (OCD), which covers both Greek and Latin authors and texts. * Either Liddell & Scott (LSJ) or the Diccionario Griego-Espa√±ol DGE uses the same abbreviations as LSJ, but is more up to date and covers a much larger selection of texts (‚Äúall Greek writers and documentary texts from Mycenaean times until the end of the antiquity‚Äù). (DGE) for Greek authors and texts, combined with either the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (TLL) or the Oxford Latin Dictionary (OLD) for Latin authors and texts. The two systems overlap substantially: Homer and Plato, for instance, are \\"Hom.\\" and \\"Pl.\\" in the OCD, LSJ, and the DGE; Cicero and Horace are \\"Cic.\\" and \\"Hor.\\" in the OCD, the TLL, and the OLD. Occasionally, however, abbreviations in LSJ and the DGE are shorter than in the OCD: for instance, Aeschylus and Euripides are \\"A.\\" and \\"E.\\" in LSJ, \\"Aesch.\\" and \\"Eur.\\" in the OCD. As a consequence, abbreviations in the OCD can be clearer than those in LSJ. However, the OCD has fewer abbreviations for authors and texts than LSJ and the OLD or TLL combined, so publications dealing with minor authors and texts not included in the OCD often have to resort to the other, fuller system. Both for Greek and for Latin texts, in both the systems referred to above, abbreviations are conventionally based on the Latin name of the author and title of the work. For instance, Aristophanes' Frogs is abbreviated Ra. or Ran. (from Ranae) and Horace's Odes are abbreviated Carm. (from Carmina). This is due to the former status of Latin as the language of scholarly communication in the discipline as well as to the usefulness of having a set of references that is valid across present-day national and linguistic boundaries. When a work is falsely attributed to an author by ancient sources, his abbreviated name is often put between square brackets: for instance, the Shield of Heracles falsely attributed to Hesiod is abbreviated as [Hes.] Sc. (from Scutum). An alternative is \\"Pseudo-\\" (abbreviated \\"Ps.\\") attached to the purported author's name, such as the anonymous \\"Pseudo-Longinus\\" who authored the treatise On the Sublime. Fragments and certain kinds of texts, such as lexica and scholia, are generally referenced with the surname(s) of the editor(s) of the edition used, so as to disambiguate it from other editions of the same text which may have different numbering systems. The surname(s) can be cited entire or abbreviated: for instance, Snell-Maehler or Sn.-M. for the fragments of Pindar. As well as authors' names and the titles of works, Classical publications often use abbreviations for other items that are relevant to Classical antiquity. These also tend to come in standardised form: * For papyri and similar materials such as ostraca, the Checklist of Editions of Greek, Latin, Demotic and Coptic Papyri, Ostraka and Tablets. * For inscriptions, the abbreviations list of the Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum (SEG). * For journals, the abbreviations list of the Ann√©e Philologique  References  Academic publishing ","title":"Abbreviations for Classical authors and texts"},{"id":"58521210","text":"Marco Koskas is a French-Israeli writer.

Ackerly is an American political scientist and Professor of Political Science at Vanderbilt University with affiliations to the Human and Organizational Development Department, Law School, Philosophy Department, and Women's and Gender Studies Program, noted for her research on grounded normative theory, feminist theory, feminist international relations, and scholar activism.  Education  Ackerly earned her BA in French and Economics from Williams College in 1988, her M.A. in political science from Stanford University in 1993, and her Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1997.  Career  Ackerly was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1997-2000 and completed a post-doctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Southern California from 2000-2001 before her employment at Vanderbilt University starting in 2001. She became Associate Professor in 2007 and Full Professor in 2017. She is an Editor-in-chief at the International Feminist Journal of Politics and Chair-elect in the Human Rights Organized Section of the American Political Science Association. Ackerly is on the editorial board of academic journals such as the Journal of Politics, Political Research Quarterly, Human Rights and Human Welfare, and Politics, Groups and Identities. She is the winner of the Vanderbilt College of Arts and Science Graduate Teaching Award. She is the founder of the Global Feminisms Collaborative, a group of scholars and activists developing ways to collaborate on applied research for social justice.  Research  Brooke Ackerly‚Äôs research has crossed between political theory and international relations, with special interest in gender issues and political methodology. One of Ackerly‚Äôs biggest contributions has been theorizing universal human rights, finding a middle ground between relativism and essentialism built through the insights of women‚Äôs human rights activists. Her Political Theory and Feminist Social Criticism (Cambridge 2000) builds from field research, feminist theory, and deliberative democracy theory, laying out a methodology for and theory of feminist social criticism. Her Universal Human Rights in a World of Difference (Cambridge 2008) builds on this theorizing, but with an emphasis on and attention to difference, disagreement, and diversity. With Jacqui True and Maria Stern, Ackerly edited Feminist Methodologies for International Relations (Cambridge 2006), which lays out both a theoretical approach to feminist methodologies for international relations and a variety of possible methods to be used. She has contributed to debates about the utility of quantitative methods for feminist theorizing, foci on people- centric notions of rights, discussions about reflexivity in research, and the role of deliberation in politics generally and feminist politics specifically, in Doing Feminist Research with Jacqui True (Palgrave 2010). Ackerly has also contributed theories of human rights, especially as it relates to global justice. Her newest book Just Responsibility: A Human Rights Theory of Global Justice (Oxford 2018), examines the difference between moral responsibility and political responsibility, and challenges conventional norms about responsibility and its basis in volition and cognition. Ackerly has been at the forefront of recent developments in the \\"grounded normative theory‚Äù methodological approach. Grounded normative theory involves the direct incorporation and/or analysis of empirical research in the processes of normative theorizing. The approach dates at least to Jane Mansbridge‚Äôs 1980 monograph cum 1983 book, Beyond Adversary Democracy, which incorporated original field work at New England town meetings and a crisis helpline center. Ackerly has been perhaps the leading recent practitioner and proponent of the approach, especially in a more critical, solidaristic vein, where the scholar theorizes with those engaged in struggles over justice and social recognition. Further, for Ackerly, grounded normative theorizing follows grounded theory as it has been more broadly developed in sociology and cognate disciplines - the method is inductive, developing normative theories from the empirical context upward, rather than bringing theoretical claims to the context. Ackerly began laying the theoretical groundwork for her own grounded interventions in her 2000 monograph, Political Theory and Feminist Social Criticism. By 2008‚Äôs Universal Human Rights in a World of Difference, she was conducting and incorporating extensive field work involving participants at World Social Forums. Her most recent monograph, Just Responsibility, presents a fully realized ‚Äúfeminist grounded normative theory approach.‚Äù It joins feminist methodologies and orientations to grounded normative theorizing. The book presents findings from Ackerly‚Äôs interviews and data and content analysis of 125 grant applications from organizations focused on women‚Äôs rights in 26 countries.

She is also considered to be the \\"first Latina to achieve national leadership\\" in the Catholic Church.  Personal Life  Padilla de Armas was born in Puerto Rico and raised in a Catholic family. Her father assisted the church with missionary work and her mother held a position in the Catholic Daughters of the Americas. At a young age Padilla de Armas was recognized by the Sisters of the Missionary Servants of the Most Holy Trinity and in turn Father Thomas A. Judge. Judge who had founded the women's arm of the Missionary Servants of the Most Holy Trinity in the mid 1920s thought Padilla de Armas should pursue a vocation with the Holy Trinity. This occurred at a time when Judge had been encouraging community members to continue doing public service as lay people instead of taking up the vocation. Possibly due to financial constraints as well as family dedication to the Holy Trinity, Padilla de Armas was put into the care of the Sisters instead of being sent to college. Soon after Judge had her travel to the Holy Trinity headquarters in Brooklyn, where she could make connections and see some of the public service work that they did there. Padilla de Armas returned to Puerto Rico, eventually establishing herself in Havana, Cuba, where she received a doctorate in law, married, and had a son Ramon Bosch. Widowed in 1945, she returned to the United States and settled in New York City with her son and only $150 to her name.  Religious leadership  Padilla de Armas encouraged the Catholic Church as well as other religious denominations in New York to expand their services to the Puerto Rican population by holding services in Spanish and having Puerto Rican representation in church leadership. In 1951, she organized a group of women to write a report on the religious needs and well being of Puerto Ricans in the city in order to get the attention of the Archdiocese of New York. This report helped form the Spanish Catholic Action office two years after. Later, while working with the First National Hispanic Encuentro (1972), Padilla de Armas educated diocesan priests in Puerto Rican language and culture.

He completed his college basketball career with Kent State.  Early life  Zabo was born in Sherbrooke, Quebec to Congolese father Ndavo Zeph Zabo and Rwandan mother Jackie Mukamayire. His parents and older brother Alexandre had settled in Canada in the 1990s to escape a brewing war in central Africa. At age 4, Zabo moved to Gatineau, Quebec, and at age 5, he began playing basketball against older opponents in a YMCA league. He played for De L'√éle High School by 7th grade and was also a member of Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team QC United.  High school career  When he was 15 years old, Zabo started living in the United States, away from his family, for high school. He first attended St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, where he was teammates with college prospects Nik Stauskas, Alex Murphy, and Kaleb Tarczewski. With St. Mark's, Zabo was ranked among the top guards in his class by ESPN. However, he decided to transfer due to the school's requirement of playing multiple sports, which forced him to play football. As a sophomore, he attended Montrose Christian School in Rockville, Maryland but left after one year over housing concerns. Zabo completed his high school career at Brewster Academy in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where he joined several NCAA Division I recruits, including Devonte' Graham and Chris McCullough. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, he helped his team finished with a 33‚Äì2 record and win the National Prep Championship and New England Preparatory School Athletic Council Class AAA title. Zabo was rated a three-star recruit by recruiting service 247Sports and ESPN. He played with CIA Bounce on the AAU circuit, a team that featured Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins, who would both become first overall NBA draft picks. College career Zabo joined a San Diego State team that was coming off a 31-5 season, and he was logging productive minutes during the nonconference season. However, after spraining his pinky toe, Zabo had trouble finding his spot in the rotation. He opted to transfer following the season. Zabo played a season at Indian Hills Community College, averaging seven points per game and attracting the attention of Division I coaches. He narrowed down his choices to Wichita State, Memphis and Iona. However, Wichita State ran out of scholarships, Memphis lost its coaching staff and Iona signed another point guard. Kent State head coach Rob Senderoff had seen Zabo play at Indian Hills while recruiting his teammate Jerrelle DeBerry, and the Golden Flashes were losing starting point guard Kellon Thomas to transfer, so Senderoff offered Zabo a scholarship. He committed to Kent State, and helped lead the team to the 2017 NCAA Tournament as a junior. He posted 5.6 points per game on the season. On January 12, 2018, Zabo scored a career-high 24 points and hit four three-pointers in a 70-69 win over Ohio. The following game, Zabo scored 23 points in a 73-71 win over Western Michigan. As a senior at Kent State, Zabo averaged 13 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists per game and shot 42.1% from the field.

The remaining Old Fila dogs preserved on farms in the interiors of Brazil are being gathered to become a formalized breed.Criador faz resgate dos animais originais filas brasileiros, que viviam nas fazendas e ajudavam a tocar a boiada. 2018. G1.com The Original Fila Brasileiro is recognized by the SOBRACI in Brazil, and despite the similar name, it is a breed apart from the modern Fila Brasileiro.¬´Original Fila Brasileiro Official Standard¬ª. SOBRACI. The term \\"Fila dog\\" has historically been used as a description of a duty or purpose of a dog. In Portuguese the verb filar means \\"to grasp strongly with the teeth\\". The Fila Brasileiro is considered dangerous and is banned in England and Wales.  History  An Original Fila Brasileiro at a farm in Brazil, 1970s The breeder and researcher Ant√¥nio Carlos Linhares Borges studied the Fila Brasileiro breed for 40 years based on the works of Ant√¥nio Roberto Nascimento, Paulo Santos Cruz, Proc√≥pio do Vale, and others. Borges realized that the original Fila dog was close to extinction as a result of crossbreeding practices that have attached characteristics of foreign breeds unrelated to the ancient Brazilian dog, starting in the 1980s. He concluded that there is a need to preserve the ancient dog that gave origin to the modern Fila Brasileiro.¬´Pesquisador valadarense resgata, em livro, a originalidade do c√£o fila brasileiro¬ª. tagarelapet.com. 2018. The morphology of the old dogs contradicts a long- standing widespread theory about the genetic pool of the authentic Fila Brasileiro, which suggests it descended from English dog breeds (the English Mastiff, the Bloodhound, and the now-extinct Old English Bulldog). Borges says that this belief encouraged the crossbreeding with these foreign breeds, which lessened the essential physical and psychological characteristics of the original Fila dog. Borges declared that the authentic Fila Brasileiro is of purely Iberian origin, in particular, related to the extinct Portuguese Alaunt, or the Iberian Alaunt. In 2018 Borges published the book Fila Brasileiro ‚Äì Preserva√ß√£o do Original, giving evidence from comparative, migratory and historical studies that the origin of the breed is the Portuguese Alaunt. It dissects each of the breed's formation theories in the light of the historical context, including old engravings or photos of dogs and other historical documents. Borges' book defends the theory that the great immigration of Portuguese to Brazil in the gold and the diamond cycle was essential to the formation of the Brazilian Fila. At that time, thousands of Portuguese arrived in Brazil, with the vast majority settling in Minas Gerais, attracted by the gold and diamond mines in the state. It is estimated that in a period of 100 years between the 18th and 19th centuries, 800,000 Lusitanian immigrants arrived in Brazil. This mass immigration of Portuguese likely brought many working dogs to the country, especially multitasking dogs such as the Portuguese Alaunt, explaining why the Fila was formed and discovered in Minas Gerais, and not in other Brazilian states. The breed developed precisely in the routes of the exploration areas of these ores ‚Äì in the cities, farms and commercial areas that existed due to the exploitation of this economic activity interconnected different regions ‚Äì and were places with constant flows of people and, consequently, of dogs. A brindle Original Fila Brasileiro, 2018 Borges studied the probable origins of the Brazilian Fila under the guidance of Andr√© Oliveira and Ant√¥nio Ferreira ‚Äì Portuguese cynologists and researchers at the University of Coimbra, Portugal ‚Äì who provided study materials, including many historical documents and photos of old Portuguese dogs, among them the Portuguese Alaunt of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Portuguese Alaunt (Al√£o Portugu√™s) is now extinct, but old photos show that it and the Fila Brasileiro (except the CBKC/FCI Standard modern Fila Brasileiro) are very similar. The Portuguese Alaunt in large part and the Transmontano Cattle Dog in small part are probably the base of the Fila Brasileiro, with some possible crosses with other types of Portuguese and Iberian dogs. For Borges, understanding the true origin of the Fila Brasileiro and preserving the original characteristics that made the Fila a dog of excellence for centuries led him to the desire to keep the genetics of the Portuguese Alaunt alive in Brazil.  Restoration work  Original Fila Brasileiro dogs on an isolated farm in Brazil The search and rescue of the last specimens that still correspond to the morphology of the farm dogs of the 1960s and 1970s is still in progress. Outside the official kennel clubs, many extremely rustic specimens are still found on anatomy, being useful on farms inland, away from contacts with foreign races, and selected on the farm for many generations. The specimens found are evaluated through anatomy and temperament, and if approved, they are cataloged, receiving the single register by the SOBRACI. Some of the approved dogs are bred to pedigree Fila dogs of the old standard, reclassified as Original Fila Brasileiros. The Nucleus of Preservation of the Original Fila Brasileiro (N√∫cleo OFB) was founded recently and is presided by Ant√¥nio Carlos Linhares Borges, through the OFB Nucleus there is the distribution of registered dogs to regional units of all Brazil for breeding purposes and controlled preservation of the breed. The \\"ideal dog\\" model is based on the standard idealized by Paulo Santos Cruz, Erwin Waldemar Rathsam and Jo√£o Ebner in 1946.

Temperament  Two Original Fila Brasileiro working cattleThe temperament of the modern Fila Brasileiro dog has become a controversial topic. The breeders of the modern dogs are proud of their \\"ojeriza\\" (extreme aversion to strangers) and are totally averse to the use of guard dog training. However some canine behavior experts have recently been demonstrating their opinion of what they consider to be the true temperament of modern dogs by classifying them as fearful dogs. According to Jairo Teixeira, a very influential dog trainer in Brazil, and some other dog trainers, the \\"ojeriza\\" of modern dogs is a synonym of fear. The Original Fila Brasileiro is so far bred by natural selection in the rural environment, in the isolated farms, working with the cattle and protecting the property and some breeders believe that this may possibly have helped to preserve their characteristic temperament. With the current rescue work ‚Äì of which there are canine behavior experts adept at the project ‚Äì the original temperament of a brave, intelligent, self-confident dog averse to strangers (with the genuine \\"ojeriza' of the old Fila dogs) is being prioritized, as well as the use of professional dog training, still unprecedented in the breed. With these actions, the critics of modern dogs declare that they intend to rescue and preserve the true temperament of the Original Fila Brasileiro.

Oktober 1977 is the title of a series of paintings by Gerhard Richter. It is based on photographs that document the deaths of three leading terrorists of the Baader-Meinhof Group in the Stammheim Prison after the release of the hostages in the hijacking by four members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine of Lufthansa Flight 181. The series shows events from a period of several years, from the capture of the terrorists to their burial. A youth portrait of Ulrike Meinhof occupies a special position.  Description  The series consists of 15 paintings in dull grey tones executed in oil paint after police and press photos, their contours blurred. The terrorism of the Red Army Faction (RAF), which kept the Federal Republic of Germany in suspense for ten years, is for Richter a metaphor for any ideology based on inhumanity. In an interview the artists clarifies his motives and responds to the question of whether the RAF is a victim of its own ideology: Certainly. But not victim of a certain left- or right-wing ideology, but of ideological behaviour in general. It has more to do with the eternal human dilemma: revolutionize and fail. The series originated between March and November 1988, ten years after the events. From hundreds of photos, Richter selected twelve motifs that he used to create 18 paintings, of which he later rejected three.Ortrud Westheider: Eine Idee, die bis zum Tod geht. Der Zyklus 18. Oktober 1977. In: Gerhard Richter. Bilder einer Epoche. Ausstellungskatalog, Hg. Uwe M. Schneede. Hirmer, M√ºnchen 2011, S. 155. Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Holger Meins are depicted in the paintings, but the characters are neither easily identifiable by their facial features nor by the titles of the paintings. The titles and the images are kept impersonal. The level of blur of the images differs; Only Meinhof and Ensslin are recognizable because they are less blurred, the others can only be identified after comparison with the source photos. Tote (English: Dead) is the title of three paintings (62 √ó 67 cm, 62 √ó 62 cm, 35 √ó 40 cm, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 667/1-3), that show a side view of the head and shoulders of Ulrike Meinhof lying on her back after her suicide on May 9, 1976. The images become progressively more blurry as their size decreases, and the clipping varies. The painting Erh√§ngte (English: Hanged) (200 √ó 140 cm, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 668) reveals the shadowy figure of Gudrun Ensslin, who hanged herself on 18 October 1977 from the bars of her cell in Stammheim. There was a second version that Richter did not include in the cycle and painted over (Decke, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 680/3). In the paintings Erschossener 1 und Erschossener 2 (English: Man Shot Down 1 and Man Shot Down 2) (both 100 √ó 140 cm, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 669 / 1-2) the body of Andreas Baader can be seen lying on the cell floor. Both pictures were made after a police photo published in the Stern magazine in 1980, the second picture being more blurred. Zelle (200 √ó 140 cm, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 670) Shows Baader's cell after the discovery of the suicides. Like the others, this picture refers to a police photo. It was published in Stern in 1980. The right side of the picture is dominated by a book case, with notable blurring in the vertical direction. The paintings Gegen√ºberstellung 1-3 (English: Confrontation 1-3) (112 x 120 cm. Catalogue Raisonn√©: 671/1-3) were based on press photos made after the arrest of Gudrun Ensslin in the summer of 1972. Richter heavily cropped the image to the upper body of the prisoners, the situation can only be conjectured from the shadow cast on the wall. Die geringste Verwischung zeigt das Jugendbildnis (67 √ó 62 cm, Werkverzeichnis: 672-1), das die junge Ulrike Meinhof darstellt. Die Vorlage zu dem Bild ist vermutlich 1970 entstanden, Meinhof wirkt auf dem Gem√§lde aber deutlich j√ºnger. The least amount of blurring is evident in Jugendbildnis (English: Youth portrait) (67 √ó 62 cm, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 672-1), that represents a 22 year old Ulrike Meinhof. The original photograph is from October 10, 1966. Relatively clear is also Plattenspieler (English: Record Player) (62 √ó 83 cm, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 672-2). It takes a special role in the cycle. With tone arm resting beside the record, it seems to fix a moment of silence, but in fact the record player was the \\"catalyst for the tragic outcome of history\\"; Baader's pistol was hidden inside it, and to the left of the machine are the cables that served Ensslin as a deadly sling. Beerdigung (English: Funeral) (200 √ó 320 cm, Werkverzeichnis: 673) is the largest image in the series. It shows the burial of Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin und Jan-Carl Raspe at the Dornhaldenfriedhof in Stuttgart on October 27, 1977. Their three coffins are clearly visible in the centre of the painting, surrounded by an anonymous crowd of mourners. Festnahme 1 und Festnahme 2 (beide 92 √ó 126 cm, Werkverzeichnis: 674/1-2) beruhen auf Polizeifotos, die bei der Festnahme von Holger Meins, Andreas Baader und Jan-Carl Raspe am 1. Juni 1972 in Frankfurt am Main entstanden und am 8. Juni 1972 im Stern ver√∂ffentlicht wurden. Man erkennt einen Garagenhof mit mehreren Fahrzeugen, darunter einen Panzerwagen der Polizei, von den verhafteten Terroristen ist nur Holger Meins auf dem zweiten Bild zu sehen. Festnahme 1 und Festnahme 2 (English: Arrest 1 and Arrest 2 ) (both 92 √ó 126 cm, Catalogue Raisonn√©: 674/1-2) are based on police photographs that were taken during the arrest of Holger Meins, Andreas Baader und Jan-Carl Raspe on June 1, 1972 in Frankfurt am Main and that were published on June 8, 1972 in the magazine Stern. A garage yard is recognizable, with several cars, including an armoured police car. Of the arrested terrorists, only Holger Meins is visible in the second image.  Exhibitions  The series was first exhibited in in Krefeld in 1989. In the same year, exhibitions at Portikus in Frankfurt am Main, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London and Museum Boymans van Beuningen in Rotterdam followed. In 1990 the paintings were exhibited in the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Grey Art Gallery in New York, the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Montr√©al and the Lannan Foundation in Los Angeles. The series was on display at the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt am Main, as a long-term loan from the artist until it was sold to the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1995. In 2004 it was part of the exhibition Das MoMA in Berlin in the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. From February 5, 2011 to May 15, 2011 the das Bucerius Kunst Forum in Hamburg showed the work as part of the exhibition Gerhard Richter. Bilder einer Epoche. Vom 18. Mai 2014 bis 7. September 2014 war er in der Fondation Beyeler in Riehen (Basel) zu sehen. From May 18, 2014 to September 2014 it was exhibited at the Fondation Beyeler in Riehen (Basel, Switzerland).

Beginning in the 1930s, Ugandan universities and secondary schools were a center for revolutionary movement. For three decades, most youth movements focused on independence from the British Empire. Following independence in 1962, activist groups shifted focus internally. Student leadership groups at universities around Uganda, especially Makerere University, were politically affiliated and elections for student government were closely tied to political standing. Student activist groups were key opposition against the regimes of Milton Obote and Idi Amin, and students were especially targeted for persecution during Amin's presidency. During Yoweri Musevini's presidency, students have been leading critics, participating in large protests both preceding and following Musevini's move to eliminate presidential term limits in 2006. Consistent opposition to President Yoweri Musevni culminated in three shutdowns of Makerere University.  Twentieth- Century student movements  = Under colonial British rule = The 1950s in Uganda showed a movement towards pan-africanism and independence, supported by the multi-national student bodies of universities like Makerere College and Uganda Christian University. In 1954, students founded the Tanganyika African Welfare Society at Makerere College, designed to promote Tanganyikan independence and fair treatment. The welfare society was considered to be one of the significant student movements of colonial Africa, along with the National Union of Ghana Students. In the mid-1950s, Abana de Baganda, the student body of Baganda, engaged in tribal protests against the colonial government. = After 1962 independence from colonial rule =  Early student philosophy on independent Uganda  In the immediate aftermath of independence, there was a divide between staff and students over the role that universities would play in the newfound regime. Senior staff, mostly expatriates and British hires, believed the universities had an obligation to be independent. Local staffers, on the other hand, saw universities as a tool to support a nationalist agenda. According to Mahmood Mamdani in University Crisis and Reform: A Reflection on the African Experience, the locals were ultimately successful and the university became politically linked. However, the educated group of young people consisted mostly of social elites. Rather than taking on the progressive movements of other student movements of the time, a survey of Ugandan university students showed political apathy.  Protests during 1960s Milton Obote leadership  Milton Obote was the political leader of Uganda from independence in 1962 until 1971. He served as Prime Minister until 1969, when he assumed absolute power following an assassination attempt. There were minor student clashes with Obote both during his leadership. In May 1968, students protested an anti-British demonstration after three Rhodesian Africans were hanged. Later that year, a group of students planned a protest in which they intended to parade in front of British High Commission in protest of arms sales to South Africa. The army stopped the march before it left campus, using tear gas to control them. In 1969, the president of the student guild was arrested and jailed for inciting an illegal demonstration, resulting in Obote's General Service Unit establishing a spy network within the university. = Protests during 1970s Idi Amin leadership = In 1971, Milton Obote was overthrown by a military coup while on a trip to Singapore. One week after the coup, Idi Amin seized power to become dictator. In 1972, early in the Amin administration, the National Union of Students of Uganda (NUSU) was banned by the government, followed by a protest against expulsion of Asian students. The President of the Student Guild of Uganda published a statement to Amin criticizing the Asian student policy as racist, and was exiled shortly afterwards. The following two Guild presidents left the country in similar, hasty circumstances. The students chose to disband the guild following the exiles, and did not re-establish it during the Amin regime. According to Bryan Langlands, this was a subtle form of protest as the government urged the students to ignore the exiles and return to normalcy, and the students refused to do so. In 1972, following administration-supported protests against the expulsion of Asian students, the Vice-Chancellor was killed by the Amin administration. The students boycotted celebrations to commemorate the Makerere's fiftieth anniversary in protest. In 1976, student protests accelerated to outright defiance of the Amin regime. In February, an Ugandan student named Paul Serwanga was shot directly outside the university, allegedly because a soldier was interested in his girlfriend. 3,500 students marched from Makerere to the student's home in Kibuli, in a \\"march of mourning.\\" By the time the students reached the center of the city, reports put the numbers at close to 30,000. Shortly afterwards, a Kenyan student named Ester Chesire disappeared. There were speculations that she had been a witness to the Serwanga shooting, and was therefore eliminated. Theresa Nanziri Bukenya, Esther Chesire's dorm warden, subsequently refused to testify before a commission investigating Chesire's disappearance. She was beheaded and dumped in front of the Africa Dorm she monitored. She was eight months pregnant. In March, students boycotted a speech from the President and instead locked themselves in their halls. The student organizers were protected by the administration and the student body, who claimed, \\"we are all leaders now.\\" Paramilitary groups were called to Makerere campus in July 1976, after students planned a demonstration demanding an investigation into Bukenya's death. To quell protests the Ugandan government allegedly limited provisions of necessities at Makerere, specifically food, electricity, and books. In August 1976, approximately 100 students were shot by police and military forces during protests.  Protests during 1980s and 1990s Milton Obote leadership  In 1979, Idi Amin was overthrown by the Tanzanian military following the Uganda-Tanzania War. Obote returned to power. During the second Obote regime, the Makerere student guild re-established. The guild was led by Opiyo Oloya, a political scientist at the University who encouraged opposition to Obote policies that were perceived to be exasperating ethnic tensions. In 1981 Oloya was forced out of the country. During the 1980s, political instability, civil war, and HIV/AIDS, greatly diminished the student population in Uganda. Of the refugees fleeing the country in the 1980s, 11.9% were students whose studies were interrupted. In 1980, a large number of students refugees abroad registered to vote in the national election. Obote attempted to visit students living abroad in Koboko during this time period, and there was an attempt to kill him. The UNLA was active in the area, coercing students into voting Obote back into office. Yoweri Musevini was first democratically elected in 1996. He had already seen the power of student movements as an organizer of strikes at Ntare School and Dar es Salaam University. When he was elected (in a contested election), there was tenuous support from the youth population. Musevini was seen as a unifier, and a member of a \\"new generation of African leaders.\\"  Twenty-first century student movements  = 2006 ecological protests against Musevini = Over time the Ugandan public has become increasingly disillusioned with the Musevini administration. In 2005, the legislature amended the constitution to allow Musevini to run for a third term. Additionally, right after the elections in 2006, Musevini deeded acres of the Mabira Forest to the Sugar Corporation of Ugandan Limited. There were allegations that Musevini and his administration received direct payments from the SCOUL to fund their 2006 presidential campaign. In one of the first examples of the internet being used to mobilize in Uganda, thousands of people protested in Kampala against the ecological violation. An estimated 300 students were involved in these protests, which also contributed to a buildup of grievances. The government under Musevini's guidance also cut funding, withheld allowances, and refused salary increases at Makerere University. These issues combined to contribute to a mass student and teacher strike. On November 12, 2006 Musevini closed down Makerere University, using his authority granted by Makerere's semi- nationalized funding structure. The last time the government shut down a university was 1989, during the civil war. The university was re-opened in January 2007. = 2013 closing of Makerere University protest = In 2013, teachers and students went on strike to protest the university and government's failure to pay promised salary increases. The government released a statement saying the \\"demand of 100% salary increase is not affordable in the short term.\\" = 2016 Kasese Massacre = In November 2016, protests erupted in the Rwenzururu region of Uganda, most violently in the city of Kasese. Historically the Rwenzururu region was unstable, especially in the early 1960s culminating in the massacre of Kongo and Amba civilians by Toora military forces. In 2008, Rwenzururu was officially recognized as a kingdom in the eyes of the Ugandan government. However, following recognition by the government inter-kingdom conflict between the Kongo and Amba groups accelerated. In early 2016, there were conflicts over politics and local election results and approximately 30 people died. In November 2016, according to the Human Rights watch, \\"the military and police attacked the kingdom's administration offices and the palace compound.\\" Popular protests erupted through Kasese, and according to the Human Rights Watch over 100 people were killed by the Ugandan government. Among the victims were a 17-year-old student working at the government building. Students throughout Uganda protested the massacre, and it was added to a bill of grievances brought by students and teachers at Makerere during strikes in the summer of 2016. = 2016 closing of Makerere University protest = On November 2, Musevini closed Makerere University in response to a teacher and student led strike. The main reason for the strike was back payment of allowances over the 2016 year, and budget cuts in the department of education. There were also tensions between students and the government over the 2016 Kasese Massacre, and Musevini's move to eliminate the constitutional age cap to further extend his power. Mass strikes resulted in destruction of property, contributing to the decision to shut down the university. = 2018 social media tax protest = In August 2018, the Ugandan government instituted a tax on social media, SMS, and What's App. Since the 2006 protests, social media has been increasingly used as an organizing and protest tool amongst young people in Uganda. While President Musevini claimed at the time the tax was intended to improve productivity, he had a history of censoring social media. He fully shut down social networks during the 2011 and 2016 elections, and there was a growing number of people who had been arrested for posting critical statements against the administration online. The social media tax also came in the wake of the populist election of MP Bobi Wine, who communicated with his supporters via Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. According to a statement from Amnesty International, ‚ÄúThis is a clear attempt to silence dissent, in the guise of raising government revenues.‚Äù Within a day, students mobilized online, using VPNs to bypass the tax and protesting with the #NoSocialMediaTax and #ThisTaxMustGo. There were also thousands of citizens who protested across Uganda, the majority of whom were under the age of 30. A group of students from Makerere University also petitioned Rebecca Kadaga over the social media tax, incentivizing her to speak out against the tax before the house. Following the public outcry, the government decreased the tax on mobile money transactions, but as of November 27, 2018, the tax on social media stands.

Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2007. The Institute includes a research and publication unit, a library, and a museum. It is located at Addis Ababa University, Sidist (6) Kilo campus, which was at the time of the IES's opening, named Haile Selassie I University after the last emperor of Abyssinia. The current director of the Institute is Dr. Ahmed Hassen, an associate professor at the university.  History of the IES  The first director of the Institute was Richard Pankhurst (son of suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst), and the first librarian was Stanislaw Chojnacki. Other directors were F√§qadu Gadamu, Taddesse Tamrat, Tadesse Bayana, Bahru Zewde, Abdussamad Ahmad, Baye Yemam, and Elizabet Walde Giyorgis.  History of the building  The Institute is housed in what was formerly the G√§nn√§ta Le‚Äôul or Princely Paradise Palace, which was constructed in 1934 as the principle palace building for Emperor Haile Selassie and his family.Wall text from 'Coronations and Palace-building,' From Palace to University: A Historical Perspective, Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

The palace was also the site of the abortive coup d'etat of 1960, and though it failed, it marked the beginning of the Ethiopian student movement, which would publicly demonstrate against the government for political, economic, and social change. The ground floor of the palace was originally a banquet hall, which is now the site of the library. The second floor held the Emperor's bedrooms and study, which is now a part of the Ethnological Museum.  Research and publication unit  This IES unit conducts and publishes research. It publishes conference proceedings, museum catalogues, reference works, and the Journal of Ethiopian Studies (JES), which was founded in 1963. The journal publishes articles in English and Amharic, with editorial support from the Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian Studies at Hamburg University. It published the national bibliography of materials published in and about Ethiopia until 1975, when the National Archives and Library of Ethiopia took over this responsibility. This unit puts on the international Ethiopian Studies conference once every nine years. There is also a monthly seminar held locally at the IES, for researchers to present their findings to each other and university staff and students.  Ethnological museum  This IES unit is the first university museum in Ethiopia. The museum has a permanent collection in five fields of study: anthropology, art, ethnomusicology, numismatics (the study of coinage), and philately (the study of postage stamps). Its hosts temporary exhibitions. It has objects dating back to the early Aksumite period. When the museum opened, it included a zoology species collection, but that is now housed at the Natural History Museum of Ethiopia at Arat (4) Kilo campus. Being the former site of the palace, the museum displays the Emperor Haile Selassie's chambers and his embroidered robes and military uniform. The Society of Friends of the IES was established in 1968 to raise financial support for the museum. Library The IES Library collects in the field of Ethiopian Studies (in the humanities and social sciences) and also preserves Ethiopian manuscripts.

Origins  On 9 April 1988, black lesbian and gay activists united to form the township-based GLOW in Johannesburg. GLOW's membership primarily consisted of Black Africans, which was uncharacteristic of other gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) groups in South Africa at the time. In particular, they were mostly black, urban, working-class youth from the townships Soweto and KwaThema. GLOW was formed to fill the void of political anti-apartheid GLB organizing in South Africa and in response to the implicit racism of prominent national organizations like the Gay Association of South Africa (GASA). In Sex and Politics in South Africa, Neville Hoad explains, ‚ÄúGLOW insisted that liberation from homophobia could not be separated from the broader struggle for liberation in South Africa.‚Äù Simon Tseko Nkoli, Beverley Palesa Ditsie and Linda Ngcobo were the founding members of the organization. Nkoli was the first elected leader of the organization. Nkoli, who also was a well-known activist with the African National Congress (ANC), lead the organization's initiatives to ensure gay and lesbian representation throughout the 1989 thrust for democracy and liberation.On 23 November 2017, the offices of the Equality and Disability units at Stellenbosch University were named for GLOW founder Simon Tseko Nkoli. In 1999, the tenth anniversary of the Pride Parade started by GLOW was held in honor of Simon Tseko Nkoli who died of AIDs the year before. There were 20,000 people in attendance. GLOW grew to have chapters in Hillbrow, KwaThema, Berea, Soweto, and Yeoville. In their manifesto, GLOW aligned themselves with the work of the African National Congress (ANC), ushering in a new political process in a way that GLB groups in South Africa had previously refused to do. At the same time, GLOW members also refused to allow GLB issues to take a backseat to democracy and anti- apartheid processes. They championed ‚ÄúGay rights are human rights‚Äù. Although members of GLOW collaborated with the ANC, the organization was never officially affiliated with it or any other political party. This autonomy enabled them to challenge and hold all parties accountable for proposing comprehensive GLB reforms and initiatives. For instance, in a 1992 newsletter, GLOW stated its manifesto, calling on all political organizations to stand in solidarity since the GLB fight for freedom could not be separated from the freedom for all South Africans. > \\"The manifesto calls upon ‚ÄòAll South Africans who are Committed to a Non- > Racist, Non-Sexist, Non-Discriminatory Democratic Future‚Äô to: UNITE in the > fight for the basic human rights of all south Africans, including lesbians > and gay men. MOBILIZE against discrimination. ASSERT the role of lesbians > and gay men in the current process of political change. CONFRONT South > Africa with the presence of its lesbian and gay community. DISPEL myths > nurtured by years of discrimination and stereotyping.\\" The GLOW newsletter was a regular and professional publication begun in 1992 by GLOW to circulate news on black gay political issues and life to membership and other gay communities across the country. Its publication has ceased.  Activism  = South Africa's first lesbian and gay pride march in Johannesburg = GLOW has hosted the annual Lesbian and Gay Pride March in Johannesburg since 1990, an opportunity to safely display GLB culture in public on a large scale. It was the first pride parade in South Africa. It was also the first pride march on the African continent. Participants had the option to cover their faces with brown paper bags for fear of persecution and the parade was planned to conclude with a kiss-in. It began with 1,000 marchers on 10 October 1990 and by the next year, participation doubled to 2,000 marchers. The march takes place every October on the second Saturday and begins at the University of Witwatersrand. Divisions across race, gender, class, and sexual orientation continue to plague GLB organizing. Most of the marchers have been white men. However, the presence of black and coloured men and women is increasing and the continued growth of the pride march to 25,000 people in 2001 and around 20,000 in 2018 is indicative of an increasingly more inclusive gay identity in South Africa. Lisa Underwood in The Drag Queen Anthology explains that ‚Äúthe [pride] march is unique in South Africa, in that it is simultaneously angry and carnivalesque.‚Äù = Lesbian Forum = At a time when many of the GLB organizations in South Africa were predominantly male and centered on the issues of men, the Lesbian Forum of GLOW was conceived of as a safe place for women and femme-identified members. One of the major challenges of the forum was the division between participants who needed social support and those who were committed to the imperative political issues. Because there were no other spaces like this one for young black lesbians to receive support, members had no choice but to attempt to address social issues, such as mental health, suicide, and social isolation, sometimes to the neglect of expressly political concerns. The Lesbian Forum published their own newsletter separate from the GLOW newsletter and it was titled ‚ÄúWet Velvet‚Äù which featured a herstory of lesbian activism in this region of South Africa. = Miss GLOW competitions = This annual drag show was organized by founding GLOW member Linda Ngcobo. It was a major event for the gay community of the townships across South Africa, attracting hundreds of people annually. The Miss GLOW Competitions, begun in the KwaThema township as the Miss KwaThema GLOW Drag Competition, were symbolic of the new openness of gay liberation in South Africa leading up to the first Pride March. The individual chapters of GLOW would hold their own competitions and the winner of each would go on to compete in the national Miss GLOW finals. The first Miss GLOW competition was held in Soweto in 1988. The Annual Miss GLOW competition was often linked to the Annual General Meetings to attract wider attendance and participation for the less popular political and organizational activity. Cross-dressing is still a mainstay in township culture and drag shows continue to be a popular event for homosexual and heterosexual members of these communities alike. = Soweto Township AIDS Project (TAP) = As the problem of HIV/AIDS continued to worsen quality of life across South Africa, members of GLOW helped to launch to Soweto Township Aids Project in 1990. Here, they were instrumental in bringing visibility to the problem as well as distributing education and resources in promotion of safe sex to stop the spread of the disease. = Gay rights workshops = GLOW hosted a workshop titled ‚ÄúLesbian and Gay Rights are Human Rights‚Äù at the University of Witwatersrand in collaboration with the Organization of Lesbian and Gay Activist's (OLGA) campaign for a Charter of Lesbian and Gay Rights in South Africa. The workshop was chaired by Kim Berman and featured a presentation from lawyer Edwin Cameron on the contours of the constitution making process. This presentation assisted community members and organization members in understanding the language of the ANC constitution and how it could be utilized to support their claim to lesbian and gay rights as human rights. This workshop was a follow-up to a community questionnaire GLOW sent out to determine which rights people deemed most important to be included in the Charter. = Advocating for gay rights in South Africa's constitution = In September 1990, OLGA submitted a proposal to the ANC Constitutional Committee for a bill of rights that ‚Äúprotects the fundamental rights of all citizens and guarantees equal rights for all individuals, irrespective of race, colour, gender, creed or sexual orientation.‚Äù It was endorsed by GLOW. This proposal garnered international attention. British human rights campaigner and journalist Peter Tatchell reached out in support of GLOW's work. He documented their activism in UK publications and shared with them examples of how other countries have incorporated gay rights into their constitution. In 1995 Beverley Palesa Ditsie was invited to advocate for lesbian rights at the United Nations Beijing International Conference on Women. These actions bolstered the demand for the inclusion of gay rights in the constitution and ultimately resulted in the non-negotiable inclusion of gay rights in the ANC constitution and the initiatives of various other political parties. In 1996 South Africa became the first post-colonial government in the world to incorporate \\"sexual orientation into the non-discrimination clause\\". Unfortunately, this legislation still didn't reflect the attitudes of the broader population toward GLB identified citizens. = Combating ANC homophobia = In 1991, Winnie Mandela was found guilty of kidnapping and beating four young men from Soweto in 1988. Her defense throughout the trial rested on the claim that she was ‚Äúsaving black youths from the homosexual advances of white Methodist minister Paul Verryn.‚Äù She both explicitly and implicitly asserted that homosexuality was abnormal. These homophobic remarks were preceded by those of Ruth Mompati, who similarly stated that gay people were not oppressed. Mompati's comments assumed that only white South Africans were or could be gay, thereby implying, like Mandela, that ‚Äúhomosexuality was a condition alien to the black community.‚Äù Due to protesting by GLB groups of these remarks, the ANC inserted a clause banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation into a draft of the Bill of Rights in 1991. This clause, however, did not lead the ANC to condemn Winnie Mandela's homophobic remarks later that year. In response to this inaction and Mandela's subsequent reinstallation within the ANC, GLOW members protested the trial and produced an ‚Äúangry open letter‚Äù demanding the ANC take seriously its commitment to sexual equality. It was sent to the National Executive Committee of the ANC and published in the national press. The letter addressed the harmful homophobic displays outside of the courtroom, the conflation of homosexuality with sexual abuse, and the use of homophobia as a strategy to deflect attention away from the real issues. Following this letter, GLOW announced a campaign calling for public support of the letter from other GLB and political groups and requesting that local and international organization stand by their commitment to gay rights in South Africa's democratic future.  Challenges and controversy  Sexism has been cited as an issue within GLOW. The issues of lesbian and bisexual members are relatively invisible. More concretely, when founding member and co-chair Palesa-Ditsie was called to represent GLOW as a gay rights activist at the UN, male members of the organization opposed the action, fearing that a woman at the forefront of the party would take attention away from the more pressing gay issues. Subsequently, Palesa-Ditsie feared for her life following her visibility in the pride parade. She had been targeted for corrective rape by heterosexual male members of her community and hoped to bring issues such as this to light when speaking at the UN Conference on Women in Beijing. The division between activism and support posed a challenge to setting an agenda that satisfied all members while advancing the aims of the organization. The activism work was most accessible to and engaged by the white and middle- to upper-class members, while the majority black and working-class members were attracted to the organization for its safe spaces and opportunities to ‚Äúmeet friends and romantic partners.‚Äù The intellectual language of activism intimidated less educated and uneducated members of the organization, while the poverty of black members was a detriment to their involvement with GLOW's political working groups. Most of GLOW's organizational budget went toward planning the annual pride march, which made it difficult to fund and sustain more small-scale projects aimed at improving gay life in the townships. Critics of the group point out that even though the majority of GLOW members are from the townships, the gay community of the townships remains unorganized. Although the organizing efforts of GLOW contributed to historic legislative, political, and social victories, in South Africa today homophobia persists and continues to threaten the livelihood of the GLB community. The continued success of the GLB movement has relied on the strategic linking of homophobia with apartheid and the anti-discrimination clause of the constitution to make gains in GLB rights where there isn't ample public support. A 2003 study found that homosexuals still rank as the third most hated group in South Africa and 40.9% of the population reported ‚Äúdisliking homosexuals very much.‚Äù Although the pride marches bring necessary media attention to the presence and issues of the Black South African community, organizers worry that there is too much emphasis placed on the spectacle of the event for onlookers and thus the issues are not taken seriously. For this reason, participants and organizers have debated the role of drag queens in the parade. Some argue that drag queens are integral to the GLB community and have a right to be included, while others argue that they draw the wrong kind of attention to what has the potential to be a serious political demonstration. Additionally, concerns about respectability from more conservative GLB groups has also been a point of debate. What began as a political demonstration in 1990 is now seen as more of a party. The 2012 pride was characterized by a clash that made activists reflect on the history of pride in South Africa and how the event has evolved over time. At the same time, today's organizers believe that in order to maximize attendance the event must be depoliticized.  Related organizations  = Gay and Lesbian Organization of Pretoria (GLO-P) = The Gay and Lesbian Organization of Pretoria was formed in 1993 and modeled after GLOW. What originally began as a social group, however, over time became a provider and facilitator of community resources. These resources included the Pretoria Gay and Lesbian Resource Centre, various types of counseling and information service, identity formation workshops, resource directory, gay map of Pretoria, and a gay issues research forum. GLO-P became known as OUT-GLB Wellbeing in 2001. = The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality (NCGLE) = Sensing the dissolution of GLOW in 1994, Simon Nkoli and many other former GLOW members went on to form The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality (NCGLE). NCGLE lobbied and collaborated with the ANC Constitutional Assembly to incorporate language and protections for gay rights in the new South African constitution. Through this organization, sodomy in South Africa was also officially decriminalized. NCGLE challenged the constitutionality of anti- sodomy laws post-apartheid in the South African Constitutional court and won their case. NCGLE is now an NGO known as the Gay and Lesbian Equality Project. = Hope and Unity Metropolitan Community Church (HUMCC) = The Hope and Unity Metropolitan and Community Church (HUMCC) was an outgrowth of GLOW. In 1994, it became a safe space for the GLB community to fuse their sexual identities with their religious identities. = Nkateko = In 1995, Beverley Palesa Ditsie and other members of GLOW left to form Nkateko in response to the invisibility of black lesbian issues and the dominance of white men and women in GLOW. The primary issues discussed were homelessness, ‚Äòcoming out‚Äô, violence, and homophobia. The organization's rapid growth without the necessary organizational structure to sustain itself resulted in the group's demise after the 1997 pride parade.

The company currently has operating mines for Rutile, ilmenite, zircon, and titanium dioxide minerals in South and Northwest Sierra Leone, specifically in the Moyamba and Bonthe Districts. Australian-based Iluka Resources Limited acquired the company in December 2016 and subsequently installed new and currently acting CEO Rob Hattingh.  History  Sierra Rutile Limited was officially founded in December 1971 by Nord Resources and Armco Steel. However, mining operations began in the area in 1967, which is recognized by some as the inception of the firm. In 1993, the company had the highest rutile (a titanium mineral) production in the world; however, this milestone was short-lived as the Sierra Leonean Civil War disrupted mining progress. * In 1995 the company abandoned their operation because of the Sierra Leone Civil War. * In January 2005, the company agreed a mining lease covering 580 km¬≤ of South West Sierra Leone, about 150 km South East of the capital. * On 28 February 2005, the company announced that they were beginning refurbishment of the Sierra Rutile Mine, to be completed in early 2006. Later in the year, they announced that they were to restart their SML Bauxite mine also. In December 2005 they acquired the Rotifunk mineral sands prospect, also in Sierra Leone, from Gondwana Investments S.A. for US$120000. In January 2006, they completed refurbishment and commissioned their primary bucket line dredge (Dredge D1), and so restarted the SML Bauxite Project. * On 25 August 2005, they listed shares on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange under the symbol: AIM: TXR.L. * In December 2007 a second Dredge D2 commenced production at the company's Sierra Rutile Mine, increasing capacity to 200,000 tonnes per year. Dredge D2 was a complete unit comprising a bucket ladder dredge and heavy mineral separation plant mounted on a single pontoon. * During July 2008 the company announced the disposal of Global Aluminium Limited to Vimetco N.V., a group owned by Vitaliy L. Machitski, for a total cash consideration of US$40 million. Global Aluminium Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, owns 100% of Sierra Mineral Holdings 1, Ltd, the operating company for the company's SML bauxite mine in Sierra Leone. * On 25 July 2008 trading in the company's shares was suspended on AIM market of the London Stock Exchange after it was announced Dredge D2 had capsized resulting in the loss of two lives. The company had insurance, but it took until 2010 for a resolution with the company's insurers to be agreed when a total of $11m was recovered. Initial estimates believed Dredge D2 could be operational by December 2009 some 14 months of the accident, this was later increased to $35m and 2 years. * In January 2009 trading in the companies shares recommenced on AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. =Placing= 16 November 2009 the company raised $25m via a placing of 151,200,000 new shares at 10 pence. The proceeds of which will fund the three projects Dredge D3, upgrade D1 wet processing plant and upgrading the company's land plant. The upgrade to D1 would cost $2 million and increase rutile recovery by 5,000 tonnes and Ilmenite recovery by 1,000 tonnes per annum. =Dredge D3= The third dredge would cost $20m adding 30,000 tonnes to annual capacity. Production was due to start in Q1 2010 and take 12 months to complete, the company later took some time to review this ambitious production schedule to redesign the dredge in order to reduce the build cost and increase its operating efficiencies. =Pala Investment Holding Limited= In September 2010 it was announced that Pala took a 29.8% holding in TXR after acquiring the majority of the Ordinary Shares held by Mr Jean-Raymond Boulle - the previous majority share holder. Pala is a US$1 billion multi-strategy investment company with a particular focus on mining and natural resource companies in both developed and emerging markets. Pala's exclusive investment advisor, Pala Investments AG, is a Swiss- based team with extensive experience within the mining and natural resource sectors. Pala seeks to assist companies in which it has long-term shareholdings by providing strategic advice and innovative financing solutions. =Government of Sierra Leone= During the second half of 2010 a dispute arose between the Government of Sierra Leone and Sierra Rutile Limited over the non payment of certain interest payments regarding a loan from the government. A resolution to the dispute was agreed in December 2010 when the government withdrew its request for the payment by Sierra Rutile Limited of all accrued interest plus the accrued balance and capital interest owing. Further, the government acknowledged that no event of default or potential event of default is outstanding, and that it has no claims regarding any prior events of default which may have occurred. =After the name change= The company was previously known as Titanium Resources Group Ltd until name, web address and trading symbol changes in February 2011. On December 7, 2016, the company was acquired by Iluka Resources Limited for . Iluka incurred the company's outstanding net debt of A$80million. Iluka has headquarters in Australia, but also operates in Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka.  Operations  = Overall Process = The relevant materials minerals are mined, albeit in different ways. After the company extracts them, they are processed in a mineral separation plant. Once separated, a truck takes the minerals to the Nitti port to be shipped.  Gangama Dry Mine  Starting in April 2015, the Gangama dry mine was built by the Sierra Rutile company and DRA Projects. On June 2, 2016, the Gangama Dry Mine was declared ready for action. It was predicted to mine up to 500 tonnes of ore per hour; Iluka is considering expanding the mine capacity by an extra 500 tonnes of ore per hour.  Lanti Dry Mine  Completed in 2013, the Lanti Dry Mine collected up to 500 tonnes of ore per hour in 2016, with Iluka considering expanding the mine capacity by an extra 500 tonnes of ore per hour.  Lanti Dredge Mine  In 2016, the Lanti Dredge Mine could collect up to 750 tonnes of ore per hour, and later 1,000 tonnes of ore each hour.  Sembehun Mine (Potential)  Sierra Rutile is currently exploring mining in Sembehun. The company has already developed the appropriate plans and assessed the area as required by creating its Environmental, Social and Health Management Plan (ESHMP) and an Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA). It has similarly received approval from Sierra Leone's Environmental Protection Agency and received an Environmental Impact Assessment License.  Controversy  = Strike = On October 23, 2018, the Australian Mining newspaper reported that miners at the Sierra Rutile Company went on strike because four union leaders were suspended after a previous strike. Because of the strike's impact on rutile production, on November 27, 2018, the newly elected president, Julius Maada Bio, got involved by asking workers to halt the strike. The Sierra Leonean has since conceded that it will not punish the workers who participated in the strike. Iluka Resources Limited, Sierra Rutile Limited's parent company, reported on November 28 that rutile production for the year would be negatively affected. = Bribery Scandal = In 2017, a former presidential candidate and the former CEO of Sierra Rutile, John Sisay, a cousin of former President Ernest Bai Koroma, was suspected of bribing high- ranking Sierra Leonean government employees to acquire mining contracts. These bribes seem to have come in the form of plane tickets, like that for Diana Konomanyi, who was a cabinet minister in the Sierra Leonean government at the time.  Sustainability Practices  = Mission = > \\"We aim to deliver maximum long-term shareholder value through the > sustainable and efficient operation of the world-class Sierra Rutile mine.\\" = Governance = Iluka has aimed at a culture of strong ethics and conduct by encouraging transparency. At the Sierra Rutile Company, this has come in the form of Sierra Leone taxes paid being included in the Iluka's general disclosure reporting. = Economic Responsibility = The company looks to add to the domestic Sierra Leonean economy by creating more job opportunities, investing in local infrastructure and services, supporting local businesses, and by supporting the community. Iluka has contributed to the Ruby Rose Educational and Recreational Centre in Sierra Leone. Sierra Rutile has created a committee to oversee fund allocation towards community related events. This Community Development Committee (CDC) plans to allocate most funds towards education and CDC related plans. In 2017, Sierra Rutile constructed a 60-meter footbridge between Higima and Nyandehun villages in the Imperi Chiefdom to help people move more safely across the two areas. The bridge is located above Lanti Dredge pond's passage for surplus water (spillway). = People = As of the merger in 2016, the company had approximately 1,600 employees, more than 95% of whom are Sierra Leonean. In 2017, the company added 360 new employees to make a total of 1,985 employees (95% Sierra Leonean). 93% of the employees are male and 7% are female. In 2017, Sierra Rutile required the entire workforce to complete the new general induction program, which emphasized maintaining safe practices while on the job. = Health And Safety = In 2017, the company increased the number of hazard reporting numbers at the mine from 34 per month in the second quarter of 2017 to 342 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017. Iluka mandated that Sierra Rutile focus on identifying risks and preventing them to ultimately create a fatality free workplace. As a result, workers are required to wear safety boots, shirts, and pants; take a daily alcohol test; and review the action plans for higher-risk activities. At the end of 2017, there were 45 recorded serious potential injuries (SPIs) at the Sierra Rutile workplace. = Social Performance = The Iluka group defines social performance as maintaining good health and safety practices, communicating and receiving feedback from investors, and promoting human rights related values where necessary. Iluka has committed to maintaining indigenous cultures in Sierra Leone and as such are required to draft Cultural Heritage Management Plans to ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples are not violated. = Environment = Because Iluka operates in multiple biodiverse locations, it looks to: * Have experts conduct survey assessments of relevant plants and animals * Evaluate how local bodies of water affect the ecosystem The Sierra Rutile company hired a geotechnical specialist consultant to conduct quarterly inspections.

The book, published by the independent press Lollipop Power, concerns Shannon dealing with the separation of her mother and Megan, her mother's former partner. It is regarded as the first picture book to include LGBT characters, and specifically the first to feature lesbian characters, a distinction sometimes erroneously bestowed upon Lesl√©a Newman's Heather Has Two Mommies. As a young lesbian working in a feminist bookstore in Denver in her early twenties, Severance sought to rectify the lack of picture book content she perceived for children with lesbian parents. When Megan Went Away was not widely distributed upon publication and proved divisive, with some praising the story for being an anti-sexist example of lesbian life and others finding its depiction of same-sex separation poorly timed, arriving at a moment when lesbian motherhood was on the rise. Copies of When Megan Went Away are primarily accessible in archives and library special collections as of the 2010s. Plot The story centers around Shannon, a preteen girl whose mother's partner, Megan, has recently separated from Shannon's mother. Shannon wanders throughout her house, noticing items Megan has taken with her, as well as items that remain, reminding her of her mother's former partner. Shannon makes a dinner of sandwiches and milk for herself and her mother, and she grows angry when her mother fails to eat the meal. In the darkness, the two cuddle beneath a blanket, reflecting on good and bad times they shared with Megan, and crying together. Later, exhausted, Shannon and her mother make their way to the kitchen where her mother fries them both hamburgers. Background and writing Jane Severance recalled attempting to write stories when she was seven years old, having \\"always wanted to be a writer\\". She came out as a lesbian and moved to Denver to study education in college, later working as a preschool teacher. In Denver, she became involved with what she later characterized as \\"a very small subset of the lesbian community [...], the very young lesbian feminists\\". Severance observed among her peers what she described as \\"some pretty wretched parenting\\", noting that the lack of older lesbian role models, dearth of education, plus poverty, mental illness, and substance abuse all contributed to the challenges in parenting faced by the community. Severance's life, in her words, \\"was all about being a lesbian\\" and she identified a need for picture book content about children with lesbian mothers like those around her. Despite a lifelong interest in having her work published, Severance was nevertheless unaware how to break into publishing. While working at Woman to Woman, a feminist bookstore, she encountered works published by the Chapel Hill, North Carolina-based feminist publishing collective Lollipop Power, a subsidiary of the Durham-based Carolina Wren Press. An independent lesbian press, Lollipop Power began publishing work in 1970 devoted to lessening gender stereotypes and gendered behavior in young children. Publication history Severance wrote When Megan Went Away when she was approximately 21 years old. She wrote to Lollipop Power, whose address was listed on the back of their books, and submitted the book to them. During the editing process, Lollipop Power rewrote a section of the book, which Severance objected to. They also suggested that she change Shannon and Megan's names, lest readers get the impression that \\"only women with Irish heritage were lesbians\\". When Megan Went Away was published in 1979 as a 32-page paperback illustrated by Tea Schook. Both the book's pages and its covers were printed on paper and bound with staples. Recommended for readers aged 5‚Äì12 years, the book did not receive a wide distribution upon its printing. Text of the story was also reprinted in 1986 in Ms. without Schook's illustrations. The story was run under the pen name R. Minta Day and published as part of the Stories for Free Children feature, consisting of anti-sexist, anti-racist fiction for children. Reception When Megan Went Away received no reviews from major book review magazines upon its publication. Lenore Gordon praised the story in the Interracial Books for Children Bulletin in 1980, writing that its strength lies \\"both in [Severance's] gentle storytelling voice and her use of detail.\\" Gordon described Schook's illustrations as having \\"a pleasurable child-quality\\" to them, which she found to be tonally inconsistent with Severance's somber text. Similarly, Carolyn Moskovitz described the story in the WLW Journal as \\"a bit downbeat\\". Writing in 1989, the English professor Virginia L. Wolf suggested that the romantic nature of the relationship between Shannon's mother and Megan might not be recognized by child readers, but that some adult readers would likely understand the story's lesbian context. While praising its attempts to depict an anti-sexist family, Gordon criticized When Megan Went Away for presenting \\"an uncommonly liberated lesbian lifestyle\\" which she viewed as minimizing the relevance of the book to a wider array of readers. According to the early childhood education scholar Dann√© E. Davis, the timing of the book's publication received criticism from some contemporary lesbians and feminists, who viewed the separation narrative of When Megan Went Away as detrimental to public perception of lesbian households at a time when lesbians motherhood was beginning to increase. Legacy Before the late 1970s, several picture books with gender- nonconforming characters existed, but there were otherwise no LGBT characters within the medium of children's picture books. Scholars of children's literature generally consider When Megan Went Away to be the first published picture book to include any LGBT characters, as well as the first specifically to feature lesbian characters and the first to depict separation in a same- gender relationship. Though the text of the story never uses the word \\"lesbian\\" to explicitly identify the characters as such, the word is used paratextually in Severance and Schook's dedication at the beginning of the book: \\"This story is for all children of lesbian mothers, for the special hardships they may face, and for the understanding we hope they will reach.\\" When Megan Went Away is sometimes forgotten as the first picture book to feature lesbian characters, with that distinction instead given to Lesl√©a Newman's Heather Has Two Mommies, not published until a decade later in 1989. For a time, the website of Alyson Books, publisher of Heather Has Two Mommies, listed Heather as the first lesbian picture book. Though Newman originally claimed Heather was the first lesbian picture book, she later acknowledged that When Megan Went Away preceded her work. Newman has said that she is \\"very careful with the wording that [she] in distinguishing Heather, choosing to describe it as \\"the first picture book that portrays a happy family that consists of two lesbian moms and their child.\\" Citing its success and notoriety, Severance has expressed the desire that Newman identify Heather as \\"the first successful book about lesbian mothers\\". Both Severance and Newman, who are personally acquainted, agreed that intangible factors like timing and luck likely contributed to the relative popularity of Heather. Severance additionally described Newman as \\"a hustler\\" who \\"knew how to run with\\" her book's popularity, while Newman stated that she believed Lollipop Power did a poor job of marketing When Megan Went Away upon its publication. In contrasting the ways in which Heather and When Megan Went Away were received, Davis wrote that both books were \\"Perhaps too early for their time\\". Since When Megan Went Away was published, Severance has written two more books: Lots of Mommies (1983), a picture book about a girl raised by four women including her mother, and Ghost Pains (1992), a young adult novel about two sisters living with an alcoholic lesbian mother. As of 2010, she was continuing to write and searching for an agent in order to publish other works for a larger audience. Copies of When Megan Went Away are difficult to find in the 2010s. Their availability is limited to library special collections and archives, and when secondary sales of the book do occur online, copies may be listed for over 40 times the original retail price of See also * Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin (1981, translated into English 1983), the first picture book to include gay male characters * 10,000 Dresses (2008), the first picture book to feature a transgender character Notes References =Cited=    * 1979 children's books 1970s LGBT literature Children's books with LGBT themes American picture books Lesbian fiction Works about divorce ","title":"When Megan Went Away"},{"id":"58522142","text":"Giacomo Bellacchi (18381924) was an Italian mathematician.

The problems of the previous destroyer leaders demonstrated that Russian design experience had atrophied in the years since the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Soviets contracted for design assistance from Fascist Italy in the mid-1930s. Delivered without any armament in 1939, Tashkent was given a temporary armament when she entered service with the Black Sea Fleet in late 1940. She was having her permanent armament installed when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) in mid-1941. During the Siege of Odessa the ship escorted a transport to Odessa and provided naval gunfire support before she was badly damaged by Axis bombers in August. After repairs were completed in November, Tashkent ferried reinforcements and supplies, evacuated wounded and refugees, and bombarded Axis positions during the Siege of Sevastopol in 1941‚Äì1942. The last ship to enter Sevastopol harbor in June before the city surrendered, she was crippled by Axis bombers on her return voyage to Novorossiysk and was sunk a few days later during an air strike on the harbor there. Her wreck was refloated in 1944, but it was a constructive total loss and was scrapped after the war. Design and description Unsatisfied with the destroyer leader, the Soviets decided that they needed foreign design assistance around 1934‚Äì1935. They requested designs for a high-speed destroyer leader from three Italian shipbuilders and accepted the submission by Odero-Terni-Orlando in September 1935. They would build Tashkent in their own shipyard and provide assistance for the Soviets to build others in their own shipyards.Rohwer & Monakov, pp. 45‚Äì46 The Tashkent-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draft of .Budzbon, p. 329 The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load.

The turrets were not ready in time so three single mounts were substituted for them in 1940. The intended anti-aircraft (AA) guns were also not ready so six semi-automatic 21-K AA guns in single mounts were installed instead; situated on a platform around the aft funnel. The ships were also provided with six DShK machine guns.Hill, pp. 42‚Äì43 They were fitted with nine torpedo tubes in three rotating triple mounts amidships. The Tashkents could also carry 76 mines and 24 depth charges which were delivered by two throwers and one stern rack. Tashkent was equipped with a gunnery director on top of the bridge, fitted with a duplex rangefinder installation, that provided data for an Italian-made \\"Galileo\\" fire-control computer, and a rangefinder. Two rangefinders were provided for the AA guns.Platonov, p. 140; Wright, p. 360 =Modifications= During a refit in June 1941, three twin-gun B-2LM turrets were fitted instead of the B-31 turrets which were still not available. The 45 mm guns were replaced by an equal number of fully automatic 37 mm 70-K AA guns. A degaussing coil was fitted in July. While under repair in September a twin-gun 39-K mount for 34-K AA guns was added on the stern that was originally intended for the destroyer which was still under construction.Wright, pp. 349‚Äì350 Construction and career Tashkents forward superstructure being swayed aboard, 1937 Tashkent, named after the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, was laid down on 11 January 1937 by Odero-Terni-Orlando (OTO) at their Livorno shipyard. The ship was launched on 28 December and turned over to the Soviets on 6 May 1939 in Odessa.Platonov, p. 141 Because OTO painted her in the blue-gray color used by the Royal Italian Navy, she was nicknamed \\"Blue Beauty\\" and \\"Blue Cruiser\\" by sailors.Bergstr√∂m & Mikhailov, p. 205; Budzbon, p. 329 She was assigned to the Black Sea Fleet on 22 October 1940 and was refitting in Nikolayev when the Germans invaded on 22 June 1941. Tashkent was transferred to Sevastopol on 10 July, being unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft twice en route, to conduct her post-refit sea trials. Problems with her propulsion machinery delayed her combat debut for another month.Platonov, p. 141; Wright, pp. 349‚Äì350 On 19 August she bombarded Axis positions with 127 shells from her main guns and she unsuccessfully searched for Axis transports two days later. On 28 August the ship helped to escort the transport from Sevastopol to Odessa. Tashkent remained in the area afterwards and provided naval gunfire support to Soviet troops near Odessa over the next three days. On the last of those days, 30 August, she was badly damaged by near-misses from three Axis bombers that knocked out her hydraulic power, punched a hole in her hull, damaged one of her propeller shafts and distorted the forecastle girders. The shockwaves from the bombs killed two crewmen, injured seven others and one man went missing. Although she was escorted by the destroyer as a precaution, Tashkent was able to sail back to Sevastopol under her own power where she was dry docked for repairs that lasted until 1 November.Platonov, pp. 141‚Äì142; Wright, p. 350 That day she sailed to Poti, Georgia, one of the new bases for the Black Sea Fleet as approaching German forces had made Sevastopol to dangerous to use. On 19 November the ship transported a cargo of ammunition to Sevastopol and bombarded Axis positions outside the city as she departed with 145 shells two nights later. Kontr-admiral (Rear Admiral) Lev Vladimirsky hoisted his flag aboard Tashkent on 25 November as commander of a convoy of ships bound for the Soviet Far East that consisted of three oil tankers and an icebreaker. Vladimirisky and his ships escorted the convoy as far as the Bosporus in very heavy weather before returning home. On 22 December, Tashkent took another load of ammunition to Sevastopol and remained there for the next five days, firing 1,037 shells in support of the defenders.Platonov, p. 142; Wright, p. 352 On 1 January 1942, the ship helped to transport elements of the 386th Rifle Division to Sevastopol and she remained there for the next few days, firing 176 main-gun shells in support of the defenders. On 7 and 8 January, she attempted to land reinforcements at Eupatoria during a Soviet counterattack, but was driven off by heavy German fire and bad weather, although she bombarded German defenses on the latter day with 79 shells from her 130 mm guns. After returning to Sevastopol, Tashkent escorted a pair of transports back to the Caucasus ports on the 15th. Two weeks later, she ferried replacements to Sevastopol and fired 79 shells at German positions on 30 and 31 January before departing on 1 February. The ship delivered 914 replacements to Sevastopol two days later. On 4 February Tashkent began focusing solely on bombarding Axis defenses; firing over three hundred 130 mm shells before resuming her transport duties on 29 April with the delivery of more replacements to Sevastpol. On 10 May the ship, together with the destroyer leader , arrived in Feodosia Bay to bombard targets, but could not identify any and returned to base without firing. A week later she delivered 689 replacements and of ammunition, following that with 775 men and of ammunition on 22 May. On her return voyage, she carried 39 soldiers, 86 evacuees, 21 torpedoes and the contents of the state bank. On 24 May Tashkent ferried 983 soldiers and of ammunition to Sevastopol and made further trips with the same types of cargo on 28 May, and 2, 6, and 23 June. The following day, the destroyer leader was the last ship to arrive in Sevastopol, landing 1,142 men, supplies and equipment of the 142nd Rifle Brigade after evading attacks by Heinkel He 111H bombers of (First Group) of Kampfgeschwader 100 (Bomber Wing 100) en route.Bergstr√∂m & Mikhailov, p. 204; Platonov, pp. 142‚Äì143; Rohwer, pp. 131, 133 After having loaded 2,100 wounded and part of the Siege of Sevastopol Panorama, Tashkent departed for Novorossiysk, but was attacked by numerous bombers on 27 June that failed to hit the ship directly. The shockwaves and fragments from the numerous near-misses, however, holed the hull multiple times, damaged her steering, flooded the forward boiler room and caused her to take on about of water. 3 crewmen and 56 of her passengers were killed and 10 crewmen and 5 passengers were wounded. Her crew claimed to have shot down at least two of her attackers. A flotilla of ships sortied from Novorossiysk to assist her; the destroyer took off 1,975 of her passengers while the destroyer towed her to Novorossiysk. The salvage ship Jupiter, the tugboat Chernomor and about 30 smaller ships also rendered assistance. Novorossiysk was attacked by Junkers Ju 88A bombers of of Kampfgeschwader 76 (Bomber Wing 76) and elements of I./KG 100 on 2 July; hitting Tashkent and Bditelny each with a pair of bombs and sinking both ships as well as Chernomor. The Soviets stripped her wreck of useful equipment and parts, transferring a pair of B-2-LM mounts and the 34-K mount to Ognevoy. When they assessed her wreck in 1943 they found that the boiler and turbine compartments had been destroyed by the bombs, her hull plating, decks, superstructure, and five transverse bulkheads were damaged and her keel was broken. Salvage operations began on 13 January 1944 although it was not until 30 August when the wreck was refloated and beached on a sandbar in the harbor. Deciding that it would not be economical to repair the ship, the navy left the wreck there until after the war when it was towed to Nikolayev to be scrapped.Bergstr√∂m & Mikhailov, p. 205; Platonov, p. 143; Rohwer, p. 177; Wright, pp. 358‚Äì359 References Bibliography   Further reading * External links * page in Russian language Tashkent-class destroyers 1937 ships Ships built in Livorno Ships sunk by German aircraft Destroyers sunk by aircraft Italy‚ÄìSoviet Union relations World War II shipwrecks in the Black Sea ","title":"Soviet destroyer Tashkent"},{"id":"58522359","text":"Government Secondary School may refer to: ; India * Government Secondary School, Bidsar * Government Secondary School, Rani ; Nigeria *Government Secondary School, Afikpo *Government Secondary School, Eneka *Government Secondary School, Owerri *Government Secondary School Usha Kadu ; Sierra Leone *Government Secondary School for Boys ","title":"Government Secondary School"},{"id":"58522366","text":"Warning was a German electronic music band founded in 1982.

It was built in 1858. It is also known as Milford Haven and Leinster Hall. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Early land grants and farms= The earliest European occupant of the Cooks River was Sergeant Thomas Smyth who arrived with Governor Phillip in the First Fleet. On 8 October 1799 he was granted 470 acres and became the first large landowner in the southern section of the Marrickville area. When Thomas Smyth died in 1804 his farm was acquired by Robert Campbell (senior) who between 1831 and 1838 carved up the property into 42 farmlets ranging from 4 to 12 acres. The Cooks River area was known for its market gardens, orchards and small farms and were an important part of the local economy from the mid-nineteenth century. Robert Campbell sold the property to Henry Mace, a chemist on 30 December 1837. When Henry Mace died on 31 December 1856 Thomas Crittenden and William Perry became the trustees. It was during the 1820s and 1830s that saw the beginning of change to the Tempe area. Alexander Brodie Spark, one of Sydney's leading merchants and traders purchased land known as Packer's Farm, Cooks River. He set about building Tempe House in 1836 designed by John Verge that was to become one of Sydney's showpiece estates at the time. In the 1840s Spark planned a model village in proximity to Tempe Estate and this no doubt would have been most attractive to prospective buyers. On 13 May 1857 William Wells purchased the property at a public auction paying the sum of 331 pounds for the property measuring 10 acres and 6 perches (4.07ha). William Wells was one of Sydney's new wealthy class. Born in Suffolk England in 1796 he was brought to trial in the Suffolk Lent Assizes Court on charges of Highway Robbery on 21 March 1816 and his sentence was committed to transportation to Australia. On 8 March 1817 Wells arrived in Sydney aboard the convict ship \\"Fame\\". In the 1822 Census it is revealed that he was living in Liverpool and working for the \\"Town Gang\\". On 28 April 1827 Wells was granted a Ticket of Leave within the District of Sydney however this was cancelled on 11 April 1828 when he was charged with 'being of Idle Character and found in an improper house at an unreasonable hour, when he was charged with robbing a man of his watch\\". Wells' Ticket of Leave was re-issued as a Ticket of Redemption on 2 January 1832. Having been granted a Ticket of leave Wells was a free man to pursue an independent occupation. On 1 July 1830 Wells purchased a Hotel License for the Kings Rams in George St, Parramatta and held that license until 1836. Wells was confirmed a government land grant on 14 May 1836 for the site of the Lord Nelson Hotel in The Rocks. On this land Wells built himself a conventional 2 storey colonial home on the north-west corner of Kent and Argyle Streets. In 1838 Wells took up the licence of a hotel diagonally opposite his own house, known first as Sailors Return and then as The Quarryman's Arms. On 6 June 1842 Wells opened his own home as the Lord Nelson Hotel. Wells licensed the Lord Nelson from 1842 until 1860 and it remained in the Wells family until 1884. =Nelson Lodge= There is nothing to conclusively date the construction of the building, although it can be safely assumed that it was built for Wells around 1858. By 1861 Wells was living at Nelson Lodge and in 1862 Wells is listed as having a \\"Nursery\\" there. While there is nothing conclusive that establishes Wells' reason for building Nelson Lodge it is possible that he was considering retiring as a \\"country gentleman\\". Tempe, otherwise known as the Cooks River was well placed for such an ambition being the rural outpost and having gentrified neighbours. In 1858 Wells would have been 62 years of age and still had quite a young family, the eldest being 22 and the youngest was only 7. Given that Nelson Lodge was listed in the Sands Directory as a \\"Nursery\\" it was possible that Wells was attempting to practice as a commercial farmer. In the same year he had also taken up a Hotel Licence for the Wynyard Hotel. Perhaps then Wells had already gauged that there was little money to be made in farming or that retirement to the country suited neither himself or his family. In any case his sojourn to the country was brief as William Wells died on 9 August 1865 at Clarence Street, Sydney of \\"chronic disease of the brain.\\" He was buried in the Camperdown Cemetery, adjacent to St Stephen's Anglican Church. The property then became the property of Ann Wells and her children. From to Edward Greville, member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Braidwood owned Nelson Lodge. He was never a local resident of Braidwood and during his term in office lived for some time at Nelson Lodge. Greville's platform was support for the working class and the development of natural resources. This supported his own interests as he owned a 2000-acre coalfield at Teralba near Newcastle. Greville was later a member of the Legislative Council from 20 April until 9 July 1903. From 1878 to 1882 Catherine Birrell owned Nelson Lodge and was a widower at the time of purchasing the property. She purchased the property for the sum of 2400 pounds. It seems that it was Mrs Birrell who was responsible for the change of name from Nelson Lodge to Leinster Hall. Mrs Birrell died in 1882 aged 45 and the property was transferred to her son Francis Birrell and Teresa Birrell. It appears that from 1882 to 1889 the owners Francis Birrell and Teresa Birrell did not live in the property but chose to rent it out. In 1886 4 perches (0.01 ha) was transferred to Public Works for the construction of Railway Street (now known as Collins Street). From 1886 to 1888 Edward Grant Ward JP owned Nelson Lodge. Ward was Registrar General and Chairman of the Lands Titles Commissioners NSW from 1870 and an Honorary Fellow of the Statistical Society of London. The Rev. Arthur Aspinall and his family owned Nelson Lodge from 1889 to 1925. In 1893 Aspinall was appointed the first principal of Scots College (Bellevue Hill) assuming full financial responsibility for and control over its affairs. Aspinall retired as principal of the school in 1913. Rev. Aspinall was responsible for the subdivision of the larger estate of Nelson Lodge into suburban allotments. A Deposited Plan dated 1923 shows the subdivision with Nelson Lodge occupying Lot 5 also known as \\"e\\" measuring .032 acres or 0.18 ha. It would seem probable that outhouses were demolished during the 1923-25 subdivision as they would have occupied allotments 17 and 18. Arthur and Helen Aspinall's daughter Jessie Strahorn (Aspinall) Freeman studied medicine at the University of Sydney as did their sons. In 1906 Jessie Aspinall was appointed the first female junior medical resident officer at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital which resulted in considerable furore by the board. Rev. Aspinall wrote a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald published on 9 February 1906 criticising the Board's decision to refuse to confirm his daughter's appointment. This resulted in considerable public protest and the Board agreed to appoint Dr Aspinall for one year. She continued her career in medicine at the Royal Hobart Hospital, at Crown Street Women's Hospital and her own practice at Lyon's Terrace and sometime school doctor for Scots College. She became a legend in the medical world at a time when female practitioners were uncommon. The property title for \\"Lot e\\" also known as Lot 5 was transferred to Charles Willie Willis in April 1925. Willis was a builder and converted the residence into flats and converted the kitchen outhouse into a residence for his family. Other alterations included removing the original stone kitchen fireplace and a new wall constructed dividing the kitchen into two, new ceilings constructed throughout of pressed metal and plaster, one window converted into a doorway, new doorway giving direct access to the outside via a staircase. Elizabeth Grace owned Nelson Lodge from December 1950 to July 1961 and it is possible that during this time the name of Nelson Lodge changed to Milford Haven. Vito Modesto owned the property from July 1961 to September 1985.Gurr & Tiutiunnik 1995 Following a nomination by the owner Mr Geoffrey Croft in 1986 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over Nelson Lodge on 7 August 1987. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The property operated as a bed-and-breakfast accommodation for many years from 1988.Day & Hodgson Real Estate, 11/2013  Description  Nelson Lodge is an archetypal single-storey colonial Georgian-style bungalow, fiive bays wide. It follows the standard Colonial Georgian plan: a central hall, with rooms of equal size on either side with wide french doors which extend the living space onto the verandahs. It has 7 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms and a basement. It exhibits typical features of the period including the broken-back roof, panelled french doors, fanlight windows, windows with large panes of glass and spreading verandah forms where cast iron columns form colonnades. Nelson Lodge is constructed of ashlar sandstone and fine-pointed drafted margins. The front and back verandah floors are of sawn stone flags. The front and back doors are identical four panel doors with fanlight and sidelights. The house has elegant double-hung sash windows. All joinery is constructed of Australian cedar. The house also has marble fireplaces, extensive decorative plasterwork and ceiling enrichments, and open grille columns on front and back verandahs cast by the Victoria Foundry of Bubb and Son. The cast iron columns are identical to those used at Admiralty House, Sydney. The roof is clad with corrugated metal sheeting, and although having numerous unsympathetic alterations the building still retains much of its original detailing. The house is located on a 1556 square meter block.Day and Hodgson Real Estate, 11/2013 There are several mature trees to the street boundary which obscure views.

Heritage listing  Nelson Lodge is an archetypal single-storey colonial Georgian-style bungalow constructed . It was built as Nelson Lodge for William Wells, licensee of the Lord Nelson Hotel, Millers Point. Nelson Lodge is an important and rare survivor of the second period of villa construction in Sydney which occurred after subdivision of the original land grants. Marrickville Municipality was the most significant location of early agriculture in inner Sydney and evidence of villa estates from this period is extremely rare. Nelson Lodge was built for William Wells and Ann (Fogarty) Wells, former convicts, publicans and owners of the Lord Nelson Hotel, the oldest surviving hotel in Sydney. Nelson Lodge was built as a symbol of the Wells' financial success and their taste and attitudes are moulded as a social document in the building's fabric. Nelson Lodge is significant for its association with eminent citizens including the Reverend Arthur Ashworth Aspinall, a founder and first principal of Scots College; Jessie Strahorn (Aspinall) Freeman, significant as a forerunner of women in the medical profession in Australia and Edward Greville, member of the Legislative Assembly for Braidwood (1870 - 1880) and member of the Legislative Council (1892 - 1903) and Edward Grant Ward, Registrar General and Chairman of Lands Titles Commissioners of NSW from 1870. The fine Australian cedar joinery of Nelson Lodge is of high quality and its intactness is of aesthetic significance. The substantially intact and recoverable decorative plasterwork at Nelson Lodge is representative of the exuberance of plaster decoration in the 1850s in Australia. The different moulded styles of plaster decoration used throughout Nelson Lodge indicates the full extent of the technological developments of plasterwork prior to the introduction of the gelatin mould technique in 1858. The plasterwork is in reasonable condition and by virtue of being extant is an exceptional example of plasterwork of the 1850s in Australia. Nelson Lodge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

History Kontum Airfield was a major tactical airlift hub in the Central Highlands used extensively in the buildup on US forces in the area in 1965-6. On 28 April 1966, an Air America Curtiss C-46D Commando crashed on takeoff. There were no fatalities, but the plane was written off. In early 1967 Company A, 299th Engineer Battalion began improving the airfield building taxiways, ramps, roads and bivouac areas. On 10 January 1968 Vietcong (VC) sappers penetrated the airfield perimeter and destroyed several helicopters with Satchel charges, killing 7 Americans and wounding 25. An estimated 16 VC were killed in the attack. At the time of the Tet Offensive in late January 1968 units based at the airfield were the 57th Assault Helicopter Company (57th AHC), Troop A, 2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment (2/1 Cavalry), Company B, 299th Engineer Battalion and a company of Montagnard irregulars. At 02:12 on 30 January, a company from the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 406th Sapper Battalion and a company from the VC 304th Local Force Battalion attacked the airfield. As the PAVN/VC penetrated the airfield defenses they were engaged by sentries and gunships from the 57th AHC stopping the PAVN attack 50 meters from the runway. The PAVN K6 Battalion of the 24th Regiment reinforced the attack and launched a new assault which was countered by two M48 tanks and four M113 armored personnel carriers from Troop A, 2/1 Cavalry, which attacked the right flank of the PAVN forcing them to retreat. The PAVN soon regrouped and attacked the armor with Rocket propelled grenades forcing them to retreat. At 09:30 Task Force Delta, comprising two helicopter borne rifle platoons and Company D, 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, landed at the airfield and moved north to attack the PAVN/VC in the city. That evening the PAVN/VC attacked the airfield again but failed to penetrate the defenses. On 31 January Company D, 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment was landed at the airfield. The PAVN hit the airfield with 122-mm. rockets on 1 February but made no further ground attacks. On the evening of 1 February two companies from the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment were flown into the airfield securing its northern perimeter. By 4 February the city had been secured and normal operations resumed at the airfield. Aircraft revetments, 19 July 1968 The airfield was the scene of heavy fighting in April-May 1972 during the Battle of Kontum, part of the PAVN's Easter Offensive. On 21 April PAVN artillery fire damaged an Air Vietnam plane, killing a flight attendant. On 24 April PAVN artillery fire damaged a USAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules and destroyed a Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) Fairchild C-123 Provider, the repaired C-130 flew out on 1 May. On 15 May 1972 a PAVN artillery attack on the airfield destroyed a C-130 as it took off killing all but 1 crewman and damaged 2 other C-130s and 2 C-123s. Another rocket/artillery attack on 23 May destroyed another C-130. By 25 May the airfield was closed to traffic and did not reopen until 8 June when the PAVN, defeated in their attack on Kontum, withdrew from the city. On 26 October 1972 a PAVN rocket attack on the base killed an American officer of Troop H, 17th Cavalry Regiment which was staging through the base. First Lieutenant Carlos Pedrosa was the last wartime casualty his unit would experience in the Vietnam War.

Downball (occasionally known as Wallball) is a multiplayer game where players take turns hitting a tennis ball with their hands against a wall until a player misses a shot and is eliminated. The last player left is declared the winner and the next round begins. It is usually played by schoolchildren. Downball walls were built in school yards. Downball has been popular in Australian schools, especially in Melbourne and elsewhere around Victoria. Downball is distinct from Australian handball, in which the ball must directly strike a wall first, rather than striking the ground first as in downball. Downball is quite different from four-square (or the Australian schoolyard variant of four-square), which is played on a marked court on the ground, with a fixed number of players, with specific roles, without a wall. Downball is usually played with a tennis ball.2-6 number players can participate. The game area usually consists of a single wall, against which the players hit the ball. The ball must hit the ground once before hitting the wall. A player has the option to let the ball bounce once after hitting the wall or may choose to hit it straight away. The round begins with the champion serving the ball against the wall (one bounce on the ground then off the wall back into play). The other players hit the ball back at the wall in turn. The order of play stays the same throughout the match. Variants on the game demand no established order of play, but a requirement for the non-hitting person closest to the bounce to play the shot. Players who fail to hit the ball back against the wall or hit the ball out of bounds go \\"out\\". When a player is \\"out\\" that player must vacate the field of play and not interfere with play until the next match (not round). A match is made up of as many rounds needed to get all but one players out of the game. The survivor becomes the champion and serves during the next match. In the event that the ball is hit by every player to the end of the line of players the game will continue in a loop. In the event the champion goes out, the player second in line becomes the champion for the remainder of the match. Downball often incorporates the addition of the \\"shark shot\\". This is played by hitting the ball on the full into another player's body with that player going out of the game. A player who misses a \\"Shark shot\\" also goes out of the game. The \\"shark shot\\" inspired a dynamic school yard varient of the game, known in Melbourne as \\"Sharky\\" or \\"Sharkey\\", which is played with as many as 14 or 15 players. When playing Sharkey, there is no established order of play. Rather the closest person to the bounce is required to play the shot. Shots may be played at the wall or at another player (a \\"shark shot\\"). Players missing a shot, failing to dodge a sharkey shot hit at them, or missing another player when attempting a shark shot go \\"onto the wall\\", meaning that player must stand against the wall and continue to dodge shots played at the wall. If hit, a player \\"on the wall\\" goes out and takes no further part in the game. A player on the wall may catch the ball after the ball is hit (\\"caught on the full\\"), after it bounces before contacting the wall, or after contacting the wall, but not after bouncing after contacting the wall. If a player on the wall catches the ball, he swaps placed with the player that hit the ball. A full player (aka a player \\"in full life\\") who catches a shark shot stays in play and puts the person who played the shark shot \\"onto the wall\\". The game is played until there is only one player left, who is awarded a \\"bag\\" (aka a \\"full bag\\"), which is a free life in the next game (meaning that if he is hit \\"on the wall\\", he may start again as a \\"full player\\"; or, if there are two \\"full players\\" towards the end of a game (and no one \\"one the wall\\"), they may, by mutual agreement, take a \\"half bag\\" each. A \\"half bag\\", when used, will allow a full player after being hit or missing a shot to stay in full play, off \\"the wall\\", or get a player hit when \\"on the wall\\" back onto \\"the wall\\". Bags and half bags may be accrued across multiple games and remain with a player until next time he plays, but must be declared at the start of recess and/or lunchtime if deciding to play.

He was arrested in West Germany in 1968 and stood trial. Bo√ühammer was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in April 1972 for his involvement in the deportation of 3,300 Jews from Italy, but died before he could serve time in prison. Biography Topography of Terror museum, Berlin) Bo√ühammer studied law in Cologne and Heidelberg, taking his first and second State examination in 1931 and 1935. Bo√ühammer joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and the Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1937. He worked for the Gestapo in Wiesbaden and Kassel before becoming a close associate of Adolf Eichmann in 1942, when he became involved in the Final Solution, the genocide on the Jews. Bo√ühammer was a convinced anti-Semite who saw Jews as sub-humans and fully supported the work of the Einsatzgruppen. Before his transfer to Italy, when the possibility arose that Bulgaria could allow 8,000 Jews to emigrate, he demanded that this had to be stopped. He was actively involved in attempts to pressure Bulgaria, Romania and Italy into a harder line against the Jews and to deport their Jewish population to German camps. From January 1942 Bo√ühammer was a member of the Jewish Section in the Reich Main Security Office, where he was responsible for the section \\"Preparation of the European solution to the Jewish problem in political regard\\", and was considered a specialists in regards to the deportation of Jews. German historian Carlo Gentile evaluated him as \\"one of the men best informed about the Final solution process. In January 1944 he replaced Theodor Dannecker in the Judenreferat of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in Verona, Italy, a role that involved the deportation of the Italian Jews to extermination camps. Contrary to earlier agreements with Fascist Italy, in which Bo√ühammer and his staff were only to assist the Italian's in the persecution of Jews, he took a lead role, making his organisation a centralised department that coordinated all German and Italian resources available for the arrests and deportations of the Italian Jews. Bo√ühammer operated independently of the Fascist authorities and rarely consulted them, the exception being a meeting with Giovanni Preziosi, one of the few true anti-semitists in the Fascist Government, who later served as the General Inspectorate of Race in the RSI. Bo√ühammer received an official recommendation and the War Merit Cross, Second Class with Swords, for his work in Italy, stating that \\"Bo√ühammer has led the fight against the Jews in the Italian region since February 1944. In so doing, he has performed noteworthy work in the service of the Final Solution to the Jewish problem and has personally distinguished himself in numerous actions against Jews\\". =Post- war= Bo√ühammer disappeared at the end of the war in 1945 and subsequently worked as a lawyer in Wuppertal. He was arrested in West Germany in 1968 and eventually sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the deportation of 3,300 Jews from Italy to Auschwitz. During the Holocaust almost 8,000 of the 45,000 Jews living in Italy perished. During his trial over 200 witnesses were heard before he was sentenced in April 1972. He died a few months after the verdict without having spent any time in prison. One of the witnesses at the trial was Italian writer Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor.

The nominee of the Communist Party, Ryzhkov was the strongest of several candidates running against frontrunner Boris Yeltsin in the election. Ryzhkov's running mate was Boris Gromov. Background Despite their opposition to the creation of a presidency, the Communist Party of the RSFSR had declared on April 5 that it was interested in nominating a candidate in the presidential election. However, the Communist Party lacked any prospective candidate who was believed to be capable of defeating Yeltsin. Ivan Polozkov, the leader of the Communist Party of Russia, was very unpopular with the Russian public. Polozkov declined to run for the presidency, citing a need for him to focus on party affairs. There was uncertainty about who the Communist Party might nominate. A well-known figure in Russian politics, polls indicated that Ryzhkov was well-liked by the Russian populace. On April 1, he declared that he intended to run for the presidency if nominated. Ryzhkov claimed that he had been urged to challenge Yeltsin by representatives of industrial and agricultural enterprises as well as public organizations. Speculation on who the Communist Party would nominate had briefly centered on Vadim Bakatin before Ryzhkov's April 1 announcement. However, immediately after his April 1 announcement, Ryzhkov became the favorite for the nomination. Within a month, Ryzhkov would secure the support of the party's central leadership. Ryzhkov had previously been put forth as a candidate for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's nomination for the 1990 Soviet Union presidential election. However, he decided not to compete.–ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π: –∫–∞–∫ –ì–æ—Ä–±–∞—á–µ–≤ —Å—Ç–∞–ª –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º –°–°–°–† BBC Russian, 11 March 2015 Ryzhkov had experienced a significant heart attack in December 1990, and had been subsequently sidelined from politics for a while. However, by spring of 1991 he was convinced that his health had been entirely restored. During May Day celebrations in Moscow Ryzhkov made statements which invited a draft effort. May 3 Ryzhkov declared in an interview with Izvestia that he would run for president. By this time an \\"initiative group\\" had already been set-up to facilitate his planned candidacy. Campaign Ryzhkov's campaign officially began on May 6, when Ryzhkov held a press conference formally declaring his candidacy. Russia's aro-industrial industry organized, and on May 8 formally nominated him to be a candidate for president. On May 13 Ryzhkov was formally nominated by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Immediately after he received the Communist Party's nomination, regional party committees immediately started to campaign for Ryzhkov using traditional methods of manipulation. He also won the immediate endorsements of figures such as Ivan Polozkov and Yegor Ligachyov (both of whose political views largely aligned with Ryzhkov's). Immediately after he received the Communist Party's nomination, regional party committees immediately started to campaign for Ryzhkov using traditional methods of manipulation. However, not all of the party was unified behind its candidates. The ultra-conservative wing of the party, the Initiative Congress of Russian Communists, rejected Ryzhkov and instead gave its backing to Aleksei Sergeev. Knowing that neither Ryzhkov or any other candidate had much chance of defeating Yeltsin outright, the Communist Party sought to lower Yeltsin's share of the vote to under 50% so that it would force a runoff. By mid-May Rhyzkov had received nominations from more than 500 enterprises and organizations and had collected more than 600,000 signatures in support of his candidacy. He was projected by TASS to have the support of 25% of the electorate. It was also in mid-May that Ryzhkov officially registered his candidacy and announced Gromov as his running mate. Ryzhkov hoped that Gromov would help him to attract the many conservative Russian voters who desired stability in society. Ryzhkov's campaign received support from organizations such as the Council of War and Labor Veterans (a political organization within the military) and the conservative RSFSR Writers' Union. In announcing Gromov as his running mate, Ryzhkov called him, \\"one of the most popular generals in our army\\" and \\"a mature political figure known for his lofty moral sense.\\" Despite the fact that his candidacy had the unofficial backing of Gorbachev's administration, he had hoped to win over voters who were becoming increasingly disenfranchised as a result of perestroika and Gorbachev's leadership, Ryzhkov tried to convince voters that he was not Gorbachev's candidate, declaring that Gorbachev's preferred candidate was instead Vadim Bakatin. For instance, he and Gromov boasted of Ryzhkov's resistance to a number of reforms enacted by Gorbachev. Ryzhkov's candidacy saw strong support from peasants, the military, and pensioners. Most of Ryzhkov's support among voters came from the countryside. Ryzhkov saw strong support from the agricultural sector, as agricultural bureaucrats hoped that, as president, Ryzhkov would resist far- reaching privatization of land and the abolition of the kolkhoz system. One of Ryzhkov's strengths as a candidate was that he was perceived as an experienced and competent manager. He had more extensive executive-level government experience than Yeltsin had. To amplify a contrast, Ryzhkov accused Yeltsin of being unfit for office, as well as a hazard to the nation's economic reforms. While his experience was one of his strengths, it also proved to be one of his weaknesses. During the short campaign period Ryzhkov found himself expending precious time defending his tenure as Soviet premier, expending nearly as much time on this as he did on outlining a vision for the future of Russia. In an effort to impugn Yeltsin's image, Rhyzkov's campaign circulated many derisive rumors about him. He also aimed to paint Yeltsin as an anti-Union candidate. While Ryzhkov had the official backing of the Communist Party of Russia, many in the party believed that Bakatin would be a superior candidate to face Yeltsin in a runoff. The party considered its primary objective to be Yeltsin's defeat in the election. Thus, upon Bakatin's entrance into the presidential race, the party began to provide support to his campaign in addition to Ryzhkov's. Nevertheless, Ryzhkov strongly benefited from being the party's organizational and propaganda apparatus. Beginning in late-May, Politburo members Alexander Dzasokhov and Yegor Stroyev began campaigning on behalf of Ryzhkov. In the final days of the election period, there was intense activity on the part of local and providential Communist Party organizations to mobilize the Russian electorate in support of Ryzhkov. =Outcome= Ultimately, Ryzhkov placed second in the election. He received a total of 13,395,335 votes, equal to 16.9% of the total vote. He placed more than forty points behind Boris Yeltsin, who won the election. Platform Ryzhkov's campaign policies were characterized as conservative (anti-reform) communist. Ryzhkov had a conservative platform aimed at appealing to those who most feared radical reform (namely government bureaucrats and those employed in the military-industrial complex). Ryzhkov largely based his campaign platform off of the former government program (which had been rejected by Gorbachev for being too cautious on reform). During his time as Soviet premier, due to his insistence on taking a gradual approach to transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy, Ryzhkov had become a target of much ire from radical reformers (especially Yelstin and his allies). Ryzhkov criticized anti-crisis program of Valentin Pavlov, Ryzhkov's successor as Soviet Premier, for unjust price increases. Ryzhkov pledged to reverse those price increases. Rhyzkov rejected capitalism and supported a socialist future for Russia. He opposed the privatization of property and promised that he would prevent the sale of Russian factories to millionaires and foreigners. He argued that, instead of being privatized, Russia's factories should be modernized with state funds. Ryzhkov ran a pro-Union platform. However, he also sought to address concerns which voters had about the government of the Soviet Union, stating, \\"I am most resolute in my intention to uphold Russians' interests. The task is to resurrect Russia, to consolidate compatriots without destroying the Union‚Äîunlike some, I believe that the Union must not be destroyed.\\" He also indicated support for a stronger role of the central government of the Soviet Union. He criticized the transfer of Russian coal mines from USSR to RSFSR jurisdiction. He rebuked Yeltsin's targeted criticisms of the central government, saying, \\"I personally think that Boris Yeltsin's position is groundless. I think we should not simply give power to a person who has not made any substantial contribution to the development of Russia, or to the strengthening of the union for that matter.\\" Additionally, Ryzhkov pledged to combat over-bureaucratization, protect the rights of Russian expatriates, and to double the salaries of state sector employees.

Insects  Crops can be completely destroyed or even partially damaged affecting the quality of the crop and the ability to germinate new ones, by decreasing the protein content and removing the seeds from the grains. = Types of Insect Pests = Lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). There are two types of grain insect pests, primary and secondary pests.  Primary Pests  Primary grain pests attack the whole grain. The eggs are laid outside the grain, before the larvae mature inside the grain and then chew their way out. Some of these pets include the Lesser grain borer, Granary weevil and Rice weevil. = Lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica) = The lesser grain borer has a dark coloured cylindrical structure with the head concealed. When lesser grain borer eggs are laid, they are laid outside the grain, however mature inside the shell of the seed which can take up to 6 weeks if the temperature is cooler, with the adult borers not living for longer than two months. This species is known to damage stored wheat, corn and cereal crops with the seeds become hollowed out husks. Products with small infestations should be discarded however the grains can be treated with smaller amounts of spray. However, large infestations require more control, including complete fumigation. Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae). = Rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) = The adult rice weevil has an orange-black exoskeleton and lays up to 450 eggs in pores of the damaged grains with each hatched egg further damaging the grain from the inside. Similarly to the lesser grain borer, maturation also happens inside the grain with the matured adult rice weevil eating through the husk of the grain to get out. The life cycle is similar to that of the lesser grain borer in summer months (approximately one month) and adult weevils live up to 8 months after the experience their life cycle. Rust-red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum).  Secondary Pests  Secondary grain insects feed on broken grain and any powder products left as a result of the broken grain. These pests include the genus Tribolium, beetle species and moth species. = Rust-red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) = The Rust-red flour beetle is a red-brown beetle with an exoskeleton that darkens in colour as the beetle increases in age, with the maximum adult age being a year. Unlike primary pests, Rust-red flour beetles can produce up to 1000 eggs and lay them inside the damaged grain with parts of the larvae able to use the damaged grains and cereal as their food source. Warehouse moth (Ephestia spp). = Warehouse moth (Ephestia spp) = The Warehouse moth is a grey moth that remains on the surface of the grain with the female moth laying up to 200 eggs, however their life span is only 2 weeks long with a 4 week life cycle. Similarly to other secondary pests, the Warehouse moth eggs use the surface of the grain, although when the larvae hatch they leave a stream of silk that encapsulates the surface of the grain which can then be used as a cocoon for mature larvae.

Navarrete first felt called to promote religious education from her adolescence while still a student before moving to the national capital where she met the Jesuit priest Alberto Cusc√≥ who formed her in the religious life. Not long after this she became a nun and set about founding schools and missions across both Mexico and the United States where she first started in Texas. Her brother Juan Mar√≠a Navarrete Guerrero became the Archbishop of Hermosillo and whose beatification process is ongoing. Her beatification process launched in Mexico in 1985 and Pope John Paul II later titled her as Venerable on 22 June 2004 as confirmation that Navarrete maintained heroic virtue in her life. Life Julia Navarrete Guerrero was born in Oaxaca on 1 June 1881 to pious parents Professor Demetrio Navarrete (who served as the director for a teacher's college) and Julia Guerrero (a music and singing teacher). Her siblings were all brothers: Francisco and Juan Mar√≠a (12.8.1896-21.2.1982) entered the religious life and her other brothers were Florencio, Rafael and Jos√©. From her childhood she maintained a deep devotion to the Blessed Mother and to the Sacred Heart that she went on to promote to others throughout her life. Her brother Juan Mar√≠a became the Archbishop of Hermosillo and whose beatification is ongoing while her brother Francisco became a priest. Navarrete made her First Communion aged seven. Her education was spent in her hometown where she was first homeschooled before entering into an all-girls school aged twelve where she became well-liked according to her peers and teachers. From age fifteen she began to feel a call to follow Jesus Christ in her life and confided this to her Jesuit confessor Fr. Antonio Repiso. He permitted her to make a private vow to remain chaste on 25 March 1898 which also received parental approval. But in 1898 in her late teens she felt compelled to follow God's call and so moved to the national capital for greater discernment and it happened to be at the height of the Mexican Revolution where attending Mass became a danger for people in some places. It was at the capital that she met the Jesuit priest Alberto Cusc√≥ who encouraged her to remain in the capital for he would help her attain her vision of promoting a Christian education to others and to become a professed religious herself where she began her formation on 5 October 1898; she was first vested in the habit that December. Navarrete made her initial profession under Cusc√≥ on 3 May 1901 not long before the priest's Jesuit superiors recalled him. Her perpetual profession was made in August 1907. Navarrete liked the prospect in her adolescence of providing a biblical education to all people in order to bring them closer to Christ. Navarrete later founded a religious congregation in 1903 and the Franciscan Observants Bishop of Aguascalientes Jos√© Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Portugal Serrato approved the order's constitution while also entrusting her to open a school. The bishop provided the order houses to use in addition to furniture and materials; this school was constructed in a short time and was opened on 4 January 1904. Bishop Serrato later provided diocesan canonical approval for her order on 12 July 1904 while the order received papal approval from Pope John XXIII some decades later on 8 November 1962. In her time heading her religious congregation she founded 51 schools and missions in total in both Mexico (47) and the United States (4) for the secular and religious education for children. Navarrete travelled to the state of Texas for the first time at the invitation of her home diocese in order to begin establishing schools and missions there; this was her first ever visit to the United States. It was in rural Kingsville in 1916 that she founded a convent for her nuns. Navarrete died due to illness that she suffered for some time on 21 November 1974 in Toluca; doctors had prescribed incorrect treatments that compounded her pain and suffering though she bore it with patience and did not complain about the inadequate treatment. Sister Maximina Cruz was present at her bedside during her final hour and had nursed her during her long illness. Her remains are interred in a chapel in Aguascalientes. Beatification process The beatification process commenced on 1 March 1985 once the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" decree (meaning no objections) and titled Navarrete as a Servant of God; the diocesan process was held in the Aguascalientes diocese from 30 June 1985 until 21 August 1992 at which point all documentation was sent to C.C.S. officials in Rome for additional investigation. The C.C.S. later validated this process on 6 March 1993 and later received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1997 to assess it. Nine theologians confirmed the cause after having reviewed the dossier on 19 December 2003 as did the C.C.S. members some months later on 4 May 2004. Navarrete became titled as Venerable on 22 June 2004 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late religious had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. Navarrete's beatification depends upon papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to her intercession; it is often a healing that medicine and science fail to explain. One such case was investigated and sent to authorities in Rome for further medical and theological assessment and after the diocesan process of investigation received C.C.S. validation on 8 June 2017.

The Hasura GraphQL Engine provides GraphQL APIs over new or existing Postgres databases. The Hasura Kubernetes Platform is a managed platform for building, deploying, and managing applications on Kubernetes. The company was founded on 2017, and has its headquarters in San Francisco and Bangalore. History Prior to founding Hasura, founders Tanmai Gopal and Rajoshi Ghosh started an online food delivery platform. While building the platform, they realised that there were questions of what stack and which programmes to use. They found that they were solving some core issues like getting a C library to communicate with a Python library and integrate the best that is available, while checking app performance. This is how their startup gradually transitioned from a food delivery platform, to building tools for developers. The technology created for the platform was a database platform that combined the use of a NoSQL API with transaction management, called \\"Procrust.es.\\" as a toolkit to be used by developers. The toolkit evolved into the Hasura platform, which was introduced in February 2017. In 2017, the company started a free online course (MOOC) called Introduction to Modern Application Development (IMAD), in partnership with IIT Madras. In April 2018, the company announced that it has raised $1.6 million seed capital from Nexus Venture Partners and GREE Ventures. Hasura became a certified vendor of the Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program, which was created by The Cloud Native Computing Foundation 2018. In July 2018, the company announced the open source release of the Hasura GraphQL Engine to enable developers to set up GraphQL endpoints on their existing postgres applications. In September 2018, the company introduced an open source event trigger system on Postgres for building serverless apps.
