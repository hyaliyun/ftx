It has the largest base (Uagati) of the temples in Gujarat, measuring 45.72 x 30.48 m. Facing East, it had a beautiful entrance arch or Kirti Toran, that is now lost. The sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha), covered pradakshina path, large gathering hall and its three shringar chokis are eye catching. On the surrounding walking path we find three directions with balconies. The mandapa has eight-sided pillars for support. In the small niches we find sculptures. The entrances are two storied. At the back wall of the temple we find two huge elephants fighting with their trunks. In Bhadra gavaksha there is the image of Brahma-Savitri, in the west is the Shiva-Parvati, to the north is Lakshmi Narayan. The Navlakha Temple built at a cost of Nine Lacs hence the name Navlakha.

It gives its name to a forest covering its headwaters and to a region. River The Ngusero and Ol Arabel rivers drain the northern end of the Aberdare Range. The river forms a delta where it enters the southeast of Lake Baringo at , and this forms a dense marsh during periods when the lake level is relatively high. The river is seasonal and in the dry period of the early 2000s no longer reached the lake. Historical land use In the past the region was used by Il Chamus herders. In the 1930s growing numbers of Tugen agropastoralists moved into the area, with some official encouragement. In the 1940s squatters moved into the Ol Arabel Forest Reserve in Laikipia District and cultivated 84 acres of land, eventually being evicted in 1947. In the 1970s the government operated a settlement scheme in Ol Arabel, but later attempted to convert the land back to forest. The Harambee settlement scheme involved to be used for cattle raising and cultivation of maize. Forest reserve The Ol Arabel Forest Reserve is part of the Marmanet forests on the eastern escarpment of the Rift Valley, north of Nyahururu. The forest reserve, which is part of the upper catchment of the Ol Arabel River, once covered , but were excised in 1993. No boundary plan was defined. As a result, about 80% of the forest had been settled by the Mochongoi settlement scheme as of 2008. In May 2007 it was announced that the European Union was funding efforts to replant forests in the region, including the Ol Arabel forest. In the past ten years Lake Baringo had been silting up and shrinking in area due to increased agriculture and reduced forest cover in its watershed, with economically important fish stocks dropping significantly. In September 2011 an officer of the Green Belt movement said the Ol Arabel forest was almost extinct due to illegal loggers and particularly to charcoal burners. The police were making no effort to prevent their activities. The rivers fed by the forest were about to dry up.

The MFS was developed to overcome the major drawbacks in the boundary element method (BEM) which also uses the fundamental solution to satisfy the governing equation. Consequently, both the MFS and the BEM are of a boundary discretization numerical technique and reduce the computational complexity by one dimensionality and have particular edge over the domain-type numerical techniques such as the finite element and finite volume methods on the solution of infinite domain, thin- walled structures, and inverse problems. In contrast to the BEM, the MFS avoids the numerical integration of singular fundamental solution and is an inherent meshfree method. The method, however, is compromised by requiring a controversial fictitious boundary outside the physical domain to circumvent the singularity of fundamental solution, which has seriously restricted its applicability to real-world problems. But nevertheless the MFS has been found very competitive to some application areas such as infinite domain problems. The MFS is also known by different names in the literature, including the charge simulation method, the superposition method, the desingularized method, the indirect boundary element method and the virtual boundary element method.  MFS formulation  Consider a partial differential equation governing certain type of problems : Lu=f\\\\left( x,y \\\\right),\\\\ \\\\ \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\Omega, :u=g\\\\left( x,y \\\\right),\\\\ \\\\ \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial n}=h\\\\left( x,y \\\\right),\\\\ \\\\ \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N, where L is the differential partial operator, \\\\Omega represents the computational domain, \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D and \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N denote the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary, respectively, \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D \\\\cup \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N =\\\\partial \\\\Omega and \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D \\\\cap \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N =\\\\varnothing . The MFS employs the fundamental solution of the operator as its basis function to represent the approximation of unknown function u as follows :{{u}^{*}}\\\\left( x,y \\\\right)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i\\\\phi \\\\left( r_i \\\\right) where r_i =\\\\left\\\\ \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)-\\\\left( s x_i,s y_i \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\ denotes the Euclidean distance between collocation points \\\\left( x,y \\\\right) and source points \\\\left( s x_i,s y_i \\\\right), \\\\phi \\\\left( \\\\cdot \\\\right) is the fundamental solution which satisfies :L\\\\phi =\\\\delta \\\\, where \\\\delta denotes Dirac delta function, and {{\\\\alpha }_{i}} are the unknown coefficients. With the source points located outside the physical domain, the MFS avoid the fundamental solution singularity. Substituting the approximation into boundary condition yields the following matrix equation :\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\phi \\\\left( \\\\left. r_j \\\\right_{x_i,y_i} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi \\\\left( \\\\left. r_j \\\\right_{x_k,y_k} \\\\right)}{\\\\partial n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]\\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\ \\\\alpha =\\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} g\\\\left( x_i,y_i \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ h\\\\left( x_k,y_k \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right), where \\\\left( x_i,y_i \\\\right) and \\\\left( x_k,y_k \\\\right) denote the collocation points, respectively, on Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries. The unknown coefficients \\\\alpha_i can uniquely be determined by the above algebraic equation. And then we can evaluate numerical solution at any location in physical domain.

MA, The method of functional equations for the approximate solution of certain boundary value problems, USSR Comput Math Math Phys. 4 (1964) 82‚Äì126.

Recent decades have witnessed a research boom on the meshfree numerical PDE techniques since the construction of a mesh in the standard finite element method and boundary element method is not trivial especially for moving boundary, and higher-dimensional problems. The boundary knot method is different from the other methods based on the fundamental solutions, such as boundary element method, method of fundamental solutions and singular boundary method in that the former does not require special techniques to cure the singularity. The BKM is truly meshfree, spectral convergent (numerical observations), symmetric (self-adjoint PDEs), integration-free, and easy to learn and implement. The method has successfully been tested to the Helmholtz, diffusion, convection-diffusion, and Possion equations with very irregular 2D and 3D domains.  Description  The BKM is basically a combination of the distance function, non-singular general solution, and dual reciprocity method (DRM). The distance function is employed in the BKM to approximate the inhomogeneous terms via the DRM, whereas the non-singular general solution of the partial differential equation leads to a boundary-only formulation for the homogeneous solution. Without the singular fundamental solution, the BKM removes the controversial artificial boundary in the method of fundamental solutions. Some preliminary numerical experiments show that the BKM can produce excellent results with relatively a small number of nodes for various linear and nonlinear problems.  Formulation  Consider the following problems, : (1) Lu=f\\\\left( x,y \\\\right),\\\\ \\\\ \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\Omega : (2) u=g\\\\left( x,y \\\\right),\\\\ \\\\ \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D : (3) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial n}=h\\\\left( x,y \\\\right),\\\\ \\\\ h\\\\left( x,y \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N where L is the differential operator, \\\\Omega represents the computational domain, \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D and \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N denote the Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries respectively, satisfied \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D \\\\cup \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N=\\\\partial \\\\Omega and \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D \\\\cap \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N=\\\\varnothing . The BKM employs the non-singular general solution of the operator L to approximate the numerical solution as follows, : (4) u^* \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i\\\\phi \\\\left( r_i \\\\right) where r_i = \\\\left\\\\ \\\\left( x,y \\\\right)-\\\\left( x_i,y_i \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\_2 denotes the Euclidean distance, \\\\phi \\\\left( \\\\cdot \\\\right) is the general solution satisfied : (5)L\\\\phi =0 By employing the collocation technique to satisfy the boundary conditions (2) and (3), : (6)\\\\begin{align} & g\\\\left( x_k,y_k \\\\right)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i\\\\phi \\\\left( r_i \\\\right),\\\\qquad k=1,\\\\ldots,m_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & h\\\\left( x_k,y_k \\\\right)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi \\\\left( r_i \\\\right)}{\\\\partial n}, \\\\qquad k=m_1 + 1,\\\\ldots,m \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\left( x_k,y_k \\\\right)_{k=1}^{m_1} and \\\\left( x_k,y_k \\\\right)_{k=m_1 + 1}^m denotes the collocation points located at Dirichlet boundary and Neumann boundary respectively. The unknown coefficients \\\\alpha_i can be uniquely determined by above Eq. (6). And then the BKM solution at any location of computational domain can be evaluated by the formulation (4).  History and recent developments  It has long been noted that boundary element method (BEM) is an alternative method to finite element method (FEM) and finite volume method (FVM) for infinite domain, thin-walled structures, and inverse problems, thanks to its dimensional reducibility. The major bottlenecks of BEM, however, are computationally expensive to evaluate integration of singular fundamental solution and to generate surface mesh or re-mesh. The method of fundamental solutions (MFS)R. Mathon and R. L. Johnston, The approximate solution of elliptic boundary-value problems by fundamental solutions, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 638‚Äì650, 1977. has in recent decade emerged to alleviate these drawbacks and getting increasing attentions. The MFS is integration-free, spectral convergence and meshfree. As its name implies, the fundamental solution of the governing equations is used as the basis function in the MFS. To avoid singularity of the fundamental solution, the artificial boundary outside the physical domain is required and has been a major bottleneck for the wide use of the MFS, since such fictitious boundary may cause computational instability. The BKM is classified as one kind of boundary-type meshfree methods without using mesh and artificial boundary. The BKM has since been widely tested. In,W. Chen and M. Tanaka, A meshfree, exponential convergence, integration-free, and boundary-only RBF technique, Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 43, 379‚Äì391, 2002. the BKM is used to solve Laplace equation, Helmholtz Equation, and varying- parameter Helmholtz equations; inW.

The book was published worldwide by the Little, Brown Book Group on 27 September 2012. A paperback edition was released on 23 July 2013. It was Rowling's first publication since the Harry Potter series, her first apart from that series, and her first novel for adult readership. The novel is set in a suburban West Country town called Pagford and begins with the death of beloved Parish Councillor Barry Fairbrother. Subsequently, a seat on the council is vacant and a conflict ensues before the election for his successor takes place. Factions develop, particularly concerning whether to dissociate with a local council estate, 'the Fields', with which Barry supported an alliance. However, those running for a place soon find their darkest secrets revealed on the Parish Council online forum, ruining their campaign and leaving the election in turmoil. Major themes in the novel are class, politics, and social issues such as drugs, prostitution and rape. The novel was the fastest-selling in the United Kingdom in three years and had the second best-selling opening week for an adult novel there since Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol. It became the 15th best-selling book of 2012 during its first week of release. Within the first three weeks the book's total sales topped one million copies in English in all formats across all territories, including the US and the UK. The book also set a Goodreads record for the all-time biggest 'started reading' day, later winning the Best Fiction category in the Goodreads Choice Awards 2012. The book was adapted into a television drama broadcast in 2015. Contents The book is dedicated to Rowling's husband, Dr Neil Murray. This was the third time Murray has received a dedication from his wife, after she shared a dedication in the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and the seventh Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book is split into seven parts, and features varying narratives. Each section is headed by a definition from Charles Arnold-Baker's book Local Council Administration. =Plot summary= Fictional town Pagford is located in the West Country, much like Rowling's birthplace Yate, Gloucestershire The novel is split into seven parts, the first depicting the aftermath of the death of local Pagford Parish Councillor, Barry Fairbrother, who suffers a burst aneurysm in the car park of a local golf course. The inhabitants of the town share the news with their friends and relatives and chaos ensues. The problem arises in deciding whether local council estate 'The Fields' should remain as part of Pagford, or instead join the local city of Yarvil, a contentious debate in which Barry Fairbrother was passionately in favour of the former option; his death is seen by many as an opportunity to end the debate once and for all. The fate of the methadone rehabilitation clinic, Bellchapel, is also a key controversy in the parish. After the date for the election to elect a replacement for Fairbrother is announced, the children of some of the councillors and election candidates decide to make damaging, yet often accurate, posts on the Parish Council online forum. Andrew, son of Simon Price is the first to do so, by means of an SQL injection which he learned how to perform in school, operating under the name 'The_Ghost_Of_Barry_Fairbrother' and informing everyone that his father had obtained a stolen computer. Sukhvinder (who, like Andrew, learns about hacking in ICT class) follows, posting that her mother, Dr. Parminder Jawanda, was in love with Barry. Thirdly, Fats Wall posts, claiming his adoptive father Cubby (a Deputy Headteacher) suffers from obsessive fear of having molested a child without any memory of the fact. Finally, in a desperate attempt to relieve the guilt weighing on him for costing his father his job, Andrew confides in Simon and posts that Council leader, Howard Mollison, is having an affair with his business partner Maureen. Howard's son, Miles Mollison, is the winning candidate, much to the displeasure of his wife, Samantha, who confesses she did not know if she still loves him, only to eventually reconcile. Another focus of the novel is the traumatic life of Krystal Weedon. Sixteen-year-old Krystal lives in The Fields with her four-year-old brother Robbie and their heroin-addicted prostitute mother Terri. Social worker Kay is determined for Terri to stop her drug use and take responsibility for the care of Robbie; however, Terri relapses and her drug dealer Obbo rapes Krystal. Spurred on to start a family elsewhere, Krystal has unprotected sex with Fats in an attempt to become pregnant. It is during one of these instances that Robbie runs away from the pair in a park, eventually falling and drowning in a river, despite Sukhvinder's attempts to save him. Krystal is so distraught she commits suicide by taking a heroin overdose, the novel culminating with the siblings' funeral. =Characters= (The Telegraph published a guide to all 34 characters.) *Barry Fairbrother, a member of the Parish Council who was born and raised in The Fields. Eloquent and fairminded, he is the leader of the faction of the Parish council wishing to keep The Fields in Pagford, in the hope the people can improve themselves as he did. He coached the girls' rowing team and was particularly fond of Krystal Weedon. It is his death that rocks the community. *Mary Fairbrother, widow of Barry Fairbrother. Due to the fact that Barry was about to publish an article about The Fields prior to his demise, she blames The Fields for occupying his mind, and therefore causing his death. *Howard Mollison, leader of the Parish Council, and of those who seek to put The Fields under Yarvil control to safeguard the community. He is the owner of a delicatessen and married to Shirley. He is morbidly obese and suffers a heart attack after Andrew's anonymous accusations that he has had an affair with business partner Maureen. *Shirley Mollison, wife of Howard Mollison and mother of Miles. She is devoted to Howard and all of his endeavours, until she learns of his affair with his business partner Maureen. *Patricia 'Pat' Mollison, daughter of Howard and Shirley and sister to Miles, who lives in London and only comes to Pagford for her father's birthday party. Her relationship with her mother is strained due to her being gay. When she comes to Howard's birthday party, she drunkenly tells Fats and Andrew of the love affair between her father and Maureen. *Miles Mollison, a lawyer who works with Gavin; he is the son of Howard and Shirley, brother of Pat and husband of Samantha. Miles runs for and eventually wins the council election. *Samantha Mollison, wife of Miles and manager of a failing bra shop. Samantha hates her life in Pagford, and has lost interest in Miles. She fancies Vikram Jawanda, and 'Jake', a member of her daughter's favourite boyband, and ends up kissing sixteen-year-old Andrew Price. She despises her mother-in-law Shirley, and appears to have an alcohol problem. *Krystal Weedon, a resident of 'The Fields' who dates Fats Wall. She suffers a traumatic childhood, raised by her heroin-addicted mother, frequently acting as sole caregiver to younger brother Robbie, and suffering rape at the hands of her mother's drug dealer. She commits suicide following Robbie's death. *Terri Weedon, a heroin addict and prostitute, mother of Krystal and Robbie and resident of 'The Fields'. She has been ostracised by her family for her addiction. She attempts to rehabilitate through the Bellchapel clinic, but fails and ultimately relapses. *Colin 'Cubby' Wall, Deputy Headteacher of the local comprehensive. He considers himself to be a close friend of Barry's and stands for election. This is later marred by anonymous accusations made by his adoptive son, 'Fats', that he is afraid of being accused of molesting a child. This considerably worsens his obsessive compulsive disorder; he often has nightmares about such acts. *Tessa Wall, wife of Cubby and adoptive mother of Fats. She is the school's guidance counsellor and has regular meetings with Krystal Weedon, although she later disapproves of her relationship with her son. Also a diabetic. *Stuart 'Fats' Wall, adopted son of Colin and Tessa, Andrew's best friend and popular at school due to his witty humour. He bullies Sukhvinder and begins a sexual relationship with Krystal Weedon. His strained relationship with his adoptive parents leaves him debating his morality and what his real parents are like. His only post as 'The_Ghost_of_Barry_Fairbrother' reveals his father's fears. When he partially causes Robbie Weedon's death, Tessa explains his birth mother had him when she was fourteen, possibly being the product of incest, and he was taken in despite Colin's poor health. He shoulders the blame for all the postings on the council website. *Andrew Price, son of Simon and Ruth and Fats' best friend. He develops a romantic interest in Gaia Bawden, securing a weekend job in Howard's delicatessen to be around her. He secretly hates his father Simon for his domineering and abusive behaviour, and resents his mother for putting up with it. He creates the username of 'The_Ghost_of_Barry_Fairbrother' to accuse his father of selling stolen goods, to destroy his chances of running for election. *Simon Price, husband of Ruth Price and Andrew and Paul's father, who is regularly involved in criminal activity. He physically and verbally abuses his children and wife, and decides to stand for election so he can receive bribes. *Kay Bawden, a social worker from London and mother of Gaia. She moves to Pagford to be with her boyfriend Gavin, and becomes Krystal and Terri's social worker temporarily. She has the most success with Terri but is then forced to give up the family's case when her co-worker returns from sick leave. She eventually breaks up with Gavin. *Gavin Hughes, a lawyer and Kay's boyfriend, although he is shown to resent her throughout the novel. He claims he was Barry's best friend and eventually confesses his love for Barry's widow, Mary, though she rejects his advances. *Gaia Bawden, Kay's attractive daughter, fancied by Andrew. She befriends Sukhvinder and detests Pagford, knowing Gavin is not interested in her mother; she wants to move to Reading to be with her father. She eventually kisses Fats Wall, much to the disappointment of Andrew and Sukhvinder, but later regrets it and reconnects with both friends at Krystal's funeral. *Parminder Jawanda, doctor and mother of Sukhvinder, whom she pressures to be upstanding like Parminder's other children. She is a member of the Parish Council and supporter of keeping \\"The Fields\\", although her motive may be her love of Barry, as posted by Sukhvinder posing as \\"The_Ghost_of_Barry_Fairbrother\\". *Sukhvinder Jawanda, daughter of Parminder, is bullied by Fats, pressured by her mother to be great, and self-harms. She was a member of the rowing team alongside Krystal Weedon, but when Krystal's great-grandmother died while under Parminder's care, Krystal threatens to hurt Sukhvinder in revenge. Sukhvinder eventually risks her life in an attempt to save Krystal's brother, Robbie. *Vikram Jawanda, handsome husband of Parminder Jawanda and father of Sukhvinder and her siblings. He is the heart surgeon who performed Howard's triple heart bypass. *The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother, the secret identity of three Pagford teens who use Barry Fairbrother's old account on the Pagford council's forum to reveal secrets of council members. Andrew Price created the identity to attack his father, Sukhvinder uses it to discredit her mother, and Fats later uses it to smear his adoptive father. Andrew again uses it with his father against Howard Mollinson to assuage his guilt. Fats eventually confesses and takes full responsibility following Robbie Weedon's death. Background =Conception= best-selling book series in history Rowling first had the idea on an aeroplane to the United States, whilst on tour for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Referring to the original conception of the Harry Potter series on a train from Manchester to London, Rowling said \\"Obviously I need to be in some form of vehicle to have a decent idea. This time I was on a plane. And I thought: local election! And I just knew. I had that totally physical response you get to an idea that you know will work. It's a rush of adrenaline, it's chemical. I had it with Harry Potter and I had it with this. So that's how I know.\\" Rowling's movement from children's literature to adult literature arose from being \\"ready to change genre\\". Referring to the Harry Potter series Rowling commented, \\"The thing about fantasy‚Äîthere are certain things you just don't do in fantasy. You don't have sex near unicorns. It's an ironclad rule. It's tacky.\\" Critics questioned whether younger Harry Potter fans might be drawn into wanting to read the book, Rowling responded saying, \\"There is no part of me that feels that I represented myself as your children's babysitter or their teacher. I was always, I think, completely honest. I'm a writer, and I will write what I want to write.\\" Rowling rejected Little, Brown's claims that the book was a \\"black comedy\\", saying in an interview with The New Yorker, \\"It's been billed, slightly, as a black comedy, but to me it's more of a comic tragedy.\\" If the novel had precedents, \\"it would be sort of nineteenth-century: the anatomy and the analysis of a very small and closed society.\\" =Choice of title= For two years, the working title of the novel was Responsible, until Rowling picked up Charles Arnold-Baker's work on local government, Local Council Administration, whilst looking something up and came across the term \\"casual vacancy.\\" The New Yorker questioned Rowling's original choice of title, and she remarked \\"This is a book about responsibility. In the minor sense‚Äîhow responsible we are for our own personal happiness, and where we find ourselves in life‚Äîbut in the macro sense also, of course: how responsible we are for the poor, the disadvantaged, other people‚Äôs misery.\\" Themes =Social issues= The Casual Vacancy features a range of social issues, including rape, racism, heroin and marijuana use, pornography, domestic abuse, child abuse, self-harm and suicide. Sukhvinder Jawanda is often berated by her mother, Parminder, and will resort to self-harm. Andrew Price, along with his brother Paul, suffer child abuse from their father Simon Price during the novel. The New Yorker questioned Rowling whether this represented her difficult childhood and relationship with her father, Rowling replied \\"Andrew's romantic idea that he'll go and live among the graffiti and broken windows of London‚Äîthat was me. I thought, I have to get away from this place. So all of my energies went into that.\\", although she added, \\"I did not have an easy relationship with my father, but no one in 'The Casual Vacancy' is a portrait of any living person.\\" =Politics and poverty= One of the novel's major themes is politics. The Guardian referred to The Casual Vacancy as a \\"parable of national politics\\", with Rowling saying, \\"I'm interested in that drive, that rush to judgment, that is so prevalent in our society, We all know that pleasurable rush that comes from condemning, and in the short term it's quite a satisfying thing to do, isn't it?\\" Rowling was also critical of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition that had led since the general election in 2010 saying, \\"There has been a horribly familiar change of atmosphere [since the 2010 election], it feels to me a lot like it did in the early 90s, where there's been a bit of redistribution of benefits and suddenly lone-parent families are that little bit worse off. But it's not a 'little bit' when you're in that situation. Even a tenner a week can make such a vast, vast difference. So, yeah, it does feel familiar. Though I started writing this five years ago when we didn't have a coalition government, so it's become maybe more relevant as I've written.\\" Rowling went on to say that Britain held a \\"phenomenally snobby society\\", and described the middle class as \\"pretentious\\" and \\"funny\\". Rowling has commented on her economic situation before the success of Harry Potter as being \\"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless\\" and said that this was why she was drawn to writing about poverty. Reception =Critical response= Rowling was interviewed in The Guardian concerning the response The Casual Vacancy would receive. She said \\"I just needed to write this book. I like it a lot, I'm proud of it, and that counts for me.\\" Referring to her initial idea of publishing under a pseudonym she commented, \\"I think it's braver to do it like this. And, to an extent, you know what? The worst that can happen is that everyone says, 'Well, that was dreadful, she should have stuck to writing for kids' and I can take that. So, yeah, I'll put it out there, and if everyone says, 'Well, that's shockingly bad‚Äîback to wizards with you', then obviously I won't be throwing a party. But I will live. I will live.\\" When released, The Casual Vacancy received mixed reviews. Lev Grossman for Time wrote in a positive review, \\"It's a big, ambitious, brilliant, profane, funny, deeply upsetting and magnificently eloquent novel of contemporary England, rich with literary intelligence and entirely bereft of bullshit.\\" The Wall Street Journal wrote \\"Once you get your Mileses and Simonses straight and events begin to unfurl, it becomes a positively propulsive read. 'The Casual Vacancy' may not be George Eliot, but it's J.K. Rowling; and that's pretty good.\\" The Guardian wrote, \\"The Casual Vacancy is no masterpiece, but it's not bad at all: intelligent, workmanlike, and often funny.\\" The Economist opined, \\"This is a novel of insight and skill, deftly drawn and, at the end, cleverly pulled together. It plays to her strengths as a storyteller.\\" David Robinson of The Scotsman praised the novel, saying, \\"It is far grittier, bleaker (and, occasionally, funnier) than I had expected, and‚Äîthe acid test‚ÄîI suspect it would do well even if its author's name weren't J.K. Rowling.\\" The Telegraph lauded the novel as well, writing, \\"One marvels at the skill with which Rowling weaves such vivid characters in and out of each other's lives, rendering them so complex and viscerally believable that one finds oneself caring for the worst of them.\\" Further positive reviews have come from reviewers for the Associated Press, Express.co.uk, The Daily Mirror, The Kansas City Star, The New Zealand Herald and the Daily Beast, the latter remarked that the book was a \\"page turner.\\" The New York Times' Michiko Kakutani panned the novel, comparing it unfavourably to Rowling's Harry Potter series and saying, \\"We do not come away feeling that we know the back stories of the 'Vacancy' characters in intimate detail the way we did with Harry and his friends and enemies, nor do we finish the novel with a visceral knowledge of how their pasts‚Äîand their families' pasts‚Äîhave informed their present lives.\\" The Los Angeles Times criticised the book, stating that it \\"fails to conjure Harry Potter's magic.\\" The Daily Telegraph maintained the novel was humorous but said \\"The novel pretty much explodes towards the end, losing shape in its fury at the dirty, unfair England that we Muggles have made for ourselves. It's like The Archers on amyl nitrate.\\" The Times said \\"The difficulty, in this fat novel, is the difference between the reader's level of interest in a wholly invented world, such as Harry Potter's, and the world we're stuck with. Rowling has a sharp eye for vivid details, and there are passages of very good writing in this book... But her fictions have little shadow in them.\\" =Sales, awards and honours= Within hours of the book's release, it had reached Number 1 position on the Amazon Book Chart in the United States. It was the second biggest adult opening of all time in the United Kingdom, falling short of Dan Brown's 2009 novel, The Lost Symbol, which sold 550,946 copies. It also fell short of Rowling's last release, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, that sold 2.6 million copies and became the fastest-selling book in history. It became the 15th best-selling book of 2012 during its first week of release. Little, Brown and Company has announced that within the first three weeks the book's total sales have topped one million copies in English in all formats across all territories, including the US and the UK. The book won the Best Fiction category in the Goodreads Choice Awards 2012. =Portrayal of Sikhism= A Sikh family plays an important part in the novel, and the description of the character Sukhvinder sparked some controversy amongst followers of the Sikh faith. Avtar Singh Makkar, the head of India's Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, commented that Rowling's book would be examined by the scrutiny board of SGPC for anything objectionable. Rowling stated that she admires the Sikh religion and had done a vast amount of research on Sikhism. Other members of the Sikh community appreciated the fact that Rowling portrayed Sikhs and Sikhism in a favourable light and actually draws attention to discriminations faced by Sikhs. Adaptation On 3 December 2012, BBC One and BBC Drama commissioned an adaptation of The Casual Vacancy. It was a joint production with US channel HBO. Filming began in August 2014. In 2015, the adaptation was broadcast on BBC One, as 3 one-hour segments. Warner Bros. is serving as the worldwide TV distributor of the series, except in the United Kingdom. Some aspects of the story were modified for the TV adaptation. For example, the controversial decision to be made by the parish council was changed from closing a methadone clinic, to closing a country house bequeathed to the village as a public amenity by a rich philanthropist, and replacing it with a spa.

As provided in the statute (Sullivan Act I), only the City of Asheville, in the provision of water, may not charge a higher rate for consumers outside city limits. Since the enactment of the legislation, several significant changes have come to Asheville: economic prosperity, adoption and termination of a City-County water agreement, and repeated efforts at overturning the legislation. While there are three Acts, the final two are modifications of the water agreement between the City of Asheville and Buncombe County. Considering the scope of issues, ranging from home rule to water rights, many different avenues of solutions have been sought. A State Representative for the area (District 116) at the time, Tim Moffitt, initiated a study committee on the issue, but was met with local opposition. Many local citizens saw the move as continued domination by the North Carolina General Assembly and sought to regain water rights for Asheville. The study committee has recently decided to move control of the water system from the city to the Metropolitan Sewerage District. Map of North Carolina, with its counties. Asheville is shown as dot, in Buncombe County. Henderson County is the county to the south of Buncombe County. Timeline Below is the timeline of major events relating to the Sullivan Acts. * 1920's: \\"Water districts emerge outside the city, taxing their own residents. They go broke during the Great Depression, and Buncombe County takes on the debt ... Asheville eventually annexes the areas, taking on the debt.\\" * 1933: The Sullivan Act is passed. * 1955: \\"Asheville passes higher water rates for noncity customers.\\" * 1958: \\"North Carolina Supreme Court upholds Sullivan and finds the higher rates illegal.\\" * 1981: \\"Buncombe County and Asheville form a water authority, but it is not fully independent. The agreement allows each government to take money from water system profits.\\" * 2004: City announces termination of the water authority, per agreement rules, and plans to take control of the system. * June 29, 2005: The North Carolina General Assembly \\"passes Sullivan II and Sullivan III, reinforcing the rate structure, requiring Asheville to extend water service to noncity residents and mandating that all water revenue go back into the water system.\\" * June 30, 2005: \\"The water agreement ends and the system becomes an Asheville department.\\" * August 10, 2005: \\"Asheville sues over the Sullivan Acts in Wake County Superior Court.\\" * February 2, 2007: \\"Judge Howard E. Manning Jr., finds in favor of the state and county.\\" History Part of Asheville in 1940. The 1920s brought prosperity to many regions until the beginning of the Great Depression, which bankrupted many regions. For the City of Asheville and Buncombe County, North Carolina, the Great Depression caused major economic damage that boiled over into other areas: The most obvious implication of the legislation comes from the city's inability to incentivize annexation as many other cities do. However, the overall economics of Sullivan Act I meant a large percentage of water revenues were for debt obligations and general fund dollars were spent on expansion and maintenance. While the city fought against the law for years, Asheville contested in the Sullivan act in the 1950s and the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the law. Later on, the city launched a failed effort for the legislature to overturn the registration. =The City/County water agreement= Asheville faced exhaustive spending on the water system because the facilities were constructed around the 1920s and the revenue constriction of Sullivan Act I. In 1981, the city and county created a water agreement. Under this agreement, some rules were laid out: * The water system was governed by a city and county appointed water authority. * Asheville's City Manager still hired water system personnel. * Titles for large city owned properties were transferred to the county, which they maintained and managed. * Asheville \\"agreed not to mount further challenges to [the] Sullivan Act.\\" * \\"The county also agreed to pay all municipalities in the county a payment that represented the amount of the Sheriff's Department budget allocated to patrol and investigation functions.\\" * \\"Under the agreement, 5 percent of water revenues went to the city and 2.5 percent to the county.\\" As time passed, few problems occurred until 1994 when a potential water shortage threatened the area. Henderson County is located just south of Buncombe County. Unfortunately, for all the parties involved, the new structure was very difficult. In 2003, Asheville had such dissatisfaction with maintenance and Buncombe County rejected implementing new fees. Thus, \\"in 2005, Asheville dissolved a joint control agreement with Buncombe and Henderson counties and took sole ownership.\\" For the city, repairs, better system control, growth control, better rates, and the promotion of voluntary annexation were all cited as reasons for termination of the water agreement. However, Buncombe County Commissioners, along with state representatives, stated that businesses needed to be protected. Thereby, the Commissioners petitioned the state legislature to reinforce the original Sullivan Act via Sullivan Acts II and III. The City of Asheville in October 2005. Current status The last of the legal attempts to overturn the Sullivan Acts was 2008. Overall, courts have decided that \\"water customers in and outside the city, rather than city taxpayers, had the greatest stake in the system because bonds were backed by water bill payments, not city taxes.\\" Technically, with the city-county agreement dissolved, Sullivan Acts II and III no longer apply. Only Sullivan Act I, reaffirmed by Sullivan Acts II and III, remains applicable law. The most recent debate began when the North Carolina General Assembly placed tight restrictions on annexation along with Representative Moffitt's help on further restrictions specific to the Biltmore Lake subdivision that Asheville was attempting to involuntarily annex. Shortly thereafter, Asheville City Council \\"raised fees by a total of $340,000 on high volume users, including many businesses.\\" The city cited a study supporting the increase because rates for high-volume users were low compared to similar areas. Representative Moffitt \\"called the rise 'arbitrary,' saying the city could pick and choose which studies to use.\\" However, city leaders emphasized the fee increase as a necessary part of keeping up the system. On May 4, 2011, Representative Tim Moffitt \\"introduced a bill that called for seizing the [water system] ... and handing it off to the Metropolitan Sewerage District.\\" Both representation and location plagued the committee as issues. The study committee was composed of four Republicans and one Democrat, with three of the committee members not located in the mountains of North Carolina (where Asheville is located). Moreover, in the actual area of the water system, two representatives, both Democrats, were left out of the committee. Based on the 2010 North Carolina General Assembly House Districts, these two representatives, Susan Fisher and Patsy Keever, represented approximately 61% of rate-payers. With 2012's redistricting, Fisher and Keever represent 68% of rate-payers. Thus, only one committee member, Tim Moffitt, represented Asheville and Representative Chuck McGrady represented Henderson County, where the water system was extended into the northern part of the county in 1994. Respectively, these representatives represent 39% based on 2010 maps and 32% based on the 2012 redistricting maps. On location, all committee meetings were held in Raleigh, except for the February 21, 2012, Public Hearing. The public hearing brought may residents, ratepayers, and elected officials from the cities and counties. While no Asheville residents who addressed the hearing favored any change, the response from elected officials was a little more mixed. The news leading up to the decision date suggested a high likelihood of the regional metropolitan sewerage district regaining control, though the representation issues were not specifically worked out. On April 13, 2012, the study committee released a unanimous decision: \\"The General Assembly should mandate that the $173.5 million system be transferred to the public body that runs Buncombe's sewage system by 2013 ... Or the city and the Buncombe County Metropolitan Sewerage District can first work out a deal.\\" As Representative Moffitt stated, \\"taking the system from the city would ensure that water customers outside Asheville would never be charged higher rates than city residents.\\" Thereby, the study committee's recommendation continues to uphold the Sullivan Acts. The Asheville City Council seems to be against the decision, though no official statement has been released. Overall, based on the study committee's report, privatization and consolidation of the region's water resources seem to be an end-goal.

The book was published on May 15, 2012 by HarperCollins. The novel takes place in an intergalactic empire, run by an aristocracy of highly trained and telepathic individuals called princes. These princes are screened by the empire and taken away from their families at a young age, then trained in isolation until they reach adulthood. Each prince is supported by a staff of priests, who can telepathically communicate with the princes. Plot summary The story introduces Khemri, a Prince, as he finishes his training and reaches adulthood. Khmeri believes he is destined for a life of luxury and freedom, however, within moments of leaving his home, he barely manages to survive several assassination attempts with the help of his first priest, called the Master of Assassins. The Master of Assassins tells him that he is in grave danger because princes are vulnerable to true death before they are able to link in to the Imperial Mind. The Imperial Mind is the supreme commander of the Empire, but it cannot see its subjects unless they link with it. Khemri and the Master of Assassins then set out for the nearest conduit to the Imperial Mind to make Khemri less vulnerable. The nearest conduit is on Kwanantil 9, a planet that is used as a training base by the Imperial Navy. The prince is upset that in order to access the Conduit, he must first enlist in the Imperial Navy and tie himself down. Upon arriving, Prince Khemri enlists in the Imperial Navy. The Priest receiving him oversees his access to the Mind, then tells him that he has been chosen by the Imperial Mind for a special task. Meanwhile, he refuses an offer from the Commandant of the base to join House Jerrazis, a middle tier House, or guild. As most of the cadets and officers at the academy are members, he becomes a target for pranks and demerits making his life there an effective hell. Just as Khemri is prepared to beg the Commandant for another chance to join the House, the academy are attacked by a small Sad-Eye raiding party. The academy as a whole is caught unawares; but Khemri is doing extras drills as punishment for his demerits with Mekbi Troopers - the principal and pseudo-autonomous ground forces of the Empire. Though he and all his Mekbi troops are killed, they successfully repel the Sad-Eye incursion, earning him several medals. The Commandant, who hates him, becomes mentally unstable after this and attempts to kill Khemri for resembling one of the academy's best cadets, Atalin. Khemri survives and manages to kill the Commandant; the Imperial Mind meanwhile hushes this up, and reports that the Commandant was killed in action against the Sad-Eyes. Despite this, it becomes clear to House Jerrazis that Khemri killed him; as a result, when his first year at the academy is over and he is eligible for duels, the Imperial Mind immediately transfers him to a supply station far away from the Empire. Though initially dreading the job, Khemri finds that the 'supply station' is in fact just a cover for the Adjustment service, the secret service of the Empire. He is then given a choice; either he can go through the test to become an Adjuster, or he can remain at the supply station, in which case he will be immediately assassinated by House Jerrazis. He chooses the test, and is given 4 months of training in 4 different artificial environments- but in a body that doesn't possess his augmented features. Though initially his Princely arrogance causes him to be hunted down in several of the environments, he passes the training and moves on to the real test; he is sent out to a far away system, on Fringe space, with few weapons and no powers. If he can find a temple and access the Imperial mind, he will have passed the test. Upon arriving there, however, he finds a dead ship, destroyed by an Imperial 'Null Wave', that destroys all Bitek and life. The ship is a missile launcher, and the missile has not been damaged; however, only one crew member is left alive, a stowaway called Raine, from the system Kharalcha, who is a member of the Kharalcha Space Forces, or KSF. she says that an Imperial ship, led by a Prince (later revealed to be Atalin, working for House Jerrazis) attacked the peaceful KSF, just as they had 9 years ago. The previous time, a group of Pirates followed soon after, nearly destroying Kharalcha; this time, they are sure to do so again. However, if the missile can be launched, it can close the wormhole, preventing the Pirates from coming, before help arrives. Raine and Khemri do so, escaping on his escape pod, though it is damaged, and they are forced to sedate themselves so that the oxygen they consume will be lowered. Khemri then awakes in Kharalcha, on an artificial space station. There, Raine and Khemri become romantically involved; however, soon after, the pirates arrive, help having come too late. Khemri is then forced to pilot an obsolete imperial ship to fight off the navy. He succeeds, but then dies, just as the Imperial mind re- establishes contact with him. Upon waking up, he finds he is in the Imperial Core, having received a medal for fighting off the Pirates, and has been nominated to take part in the competition for the Imperial throne. At the same time, Atalin gets a medal for destroying the KSF fleet. Kharalcha, meanwhile, has been placed under the protection of the Imperial Mind. After an argument, the two get into a duel, which Khemri wins, though he refrains from killing her because he discovers that she is his sister, and they are both 2 of the 5 possible candidates for the Imperial throne; the other 995 are just selected out of tradition. The 1000 Imperial candidates are then put through two tests; one of them tests their Psitek ability; all but the chosen 5 are killed here. Atalin and Khemri then kill the remainder of the chosen 5. Rather than become Emperor, though, Khemri fatally injures Atalin, them kills himself, ensuring that she will become Emperor, on the condition that he is allowed to return to Kharalcha to be back with Raine; Atalin accedes to this request. The book then ends with Khemri being picked up by Raine. Setting The setting is in the distant future (it is not explicitly stated). The majority of the galaxy (presumably, though not explicitly stated, the Milky Way) is under the control of the Empire; however, there are at least three other political entities stated; The Naknuk rebels, the Sad-Eyes, and the Deaders. Each of these, though, is reported to be inferior militarily to the Empire. There are three 'teks', or technologies types used by the Empire; Bitek, which deals with biological weaponry and technology; Psitek, which deals with the mental equivalent of the former; and Mektek, which deals with the Mechanical equivalent of the former two. These are used as a 'Trinity' by the empire to defeat their enemies; the Sad-Eyes (which control beings mentally; they are called Sad- Eyes because the only part of the body they cannot control are the tear ducts), though stronger in Psi-tek, have limited Bitek and Mektek, and are defeated thus; the Naknuk rebels, former Imperial Princes (presumably of House Naknuk) focused entirely on Bitek, shunning the other two, as a result they are defeated; the Deaders, meanwhile, never allow themselves to be captured, if they are defeated, they self destruct- at the same time, they never take prisoners. The Empire is ruled by an Emperor who abdicates after twenty years. Until then, they rule over the Imperial Mind, which is actually the minds of the former Emperors, subsumed into the Mind till they are effectively one with it. The Emperor must be replaced every twenty years because after that, the Emperor is no longer able to keep from being subsumed. The Empire is partially commanded by some 10 million Princes. They are taken at a young age, before they remember anything about their parents, selected by the ability to go through the process of becoming a Prince. After this, they spend most of the next ten years having Bitek, Psitek, and Mektek additions (though there is always some innate Psitek), until they finally end up spending the time until age 18 learning of the duties of the Prince and the Empire. Every 20 years, 1000 of these are selected to become Imperial Candidates- one becomes Emperor, while the rest are killed. Houses are groups of Princes- ranging in size from a few dozen to tens of thousands- who function, effectively, as a support system for one another. The Naknuk Rebels were an Imperial House who split off to form their own Empire. =The Priesthoods = In the Empire are 16 'priesthoods' of the Emperor, each concerned with a particular 'aspect', or service. The priests are the servants of the Imperial Mind (Which in turn is subservient to the Emperor). Princes do not consider the Emperor a God, and nor do his priests. Priests are either assigned to Princes or to temples; at temples, new priests (of that particular aspect) are trained. The Aspects are * Inquiring Intelligence: * Weighty Decision Maker: Specialists in genetic testing for choosing Prince Candidates * Emperor's Loving Heart: * Shadowed Blade: Perform as assassins for Princes. * Mending Hand: * Noble Warrior: * Cold Calculator: Specialists in calculating probability of events * Emperor's Discerning Hand: Handle sensitive matters for the emperor. Decide whether Princes should be reborn. * Inward Traveller: Specialists in Psitek, especially the 'witnessing' of events by the Imperial mind; they are the connection between the Imperial mind and the Princes. * Kindly Gardener: Specialists in Bitek, includes medics and botanists. * Rigorous Engineer: Specialists in Mektek, including small devices and weapons *Companion of Life: * Instructive Father: * Joyful Companion: * Wrathful Foe: * Stern Adjudicator: Regulates the disputes between Princes, especially relating to duels. The Imperial Services The Princes serve the Emperor in 7 different 'aspects' *Imperial Survey: Finds wormholes, the primary method of FTL travel, suspected to have been set up by an ancient race. *Navy: The space-borne branch of the military. *Marines: The planet-based branch of the military; Mekbi troopers are under this command. *Diplomatic Corps: Aids in diplomacy. *Colonial Government: Aids in the Governance of the colonies. *Imperial Government: Aids in the Governance of the Empire. *Adjustment: Secret service of the Empire; the espionage service.

The cartoon is loosely based on the Capcom fighting game Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors. It ran for one season of thirteen episodes. Plot As the television series was aimed towards a young audience, the violence and the sexual content present in the games were toned down. In addition, rather than following the complex backstory of the games, the show went for a standard good-vs.-evil plot. Various changes were made to the game characters themselves, most notably Morrigan Aensland, who became a villain descended from Morgan le Fay, and served alongside Demitri Maximoff (who was her rival in the games), under Pyron's command. The main protagonist is an ordinary human boy named Harry Grimoire, a descendant of Merlin created exclusively for the show, with whom Felicia forms a partnership.

According to a June 1995 news article in GamePro, the show would \\"star Bobby Bridges [later renamed Harry Grimoire], a kid who befriends the game's supernatural cast of characters and sets out to prevent an alien invasion.\\"GamePro 71 (June 1995), p. 148. Jun Aida, Capcom's director of licensing, said: \\"With an enormous built-in audience of young arcade players across the nation and a colorful range of fun, but spooky characters who lend themselves so well to animated television, we're confident that Darkstalkers will be a big hit with kids everywhere. This show will make it hip to be scared. ... It's this decade's answer to the popular Ghostbusters sensation of the 80s.\\"Capcom press release‚Äî1995; reprinted on Google Groups. Retrieved July 15, 2015. Reception The series was received negatively, both as an adaptation and as an animated series, mainly amongst fans who compared the show to the production values of the original games, which are significantly different from this series, which is aimed at a younger audience than that of the original games. Topless Robot included Harry Grimoire, who \\"turned Capcom's gorgeously animated fighting game into a cheap, unfunny comedy,\\" on their 2010 list of the 10 worst cartoon kid sidekicks. Rachel Jagielski of VentureBeat commented, \\"The plot is bad. But even more offensive than that is the shoddy animation.\\" Ryan Winterhalter of GamesRadar, in 2014, blamed the \\"network\\" (of which, it did not air on any; it was syndicated) in his negative review, opining that the show \\"takes the characters that fighting gamers know and love and throws them out the window. In their place, [UPN] inserted the most idiotic band of video game character doppelgangers that you could imagine.\\" The same year, Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar commented, \\"If you're one of those unfortunate enough to have watched the horrendous Darkstalkers cartoon that aired in the US, you have my sympathies.\\" Vincent Chiucchi of 411Mania rated it first in his 2008 list of the top five \\"most shameful\\" video game cartoons, lambasting it as \\"the worst video game cartoon in history\\" while adding, \\"Everything about this cartoon is horrible. The plot is stupid, the animation is complete garbage, and the dialog is atrocious.\\" See also *Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge, the 1997 anime miniseries *Street Fighter (TV series) *Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm References External links *Darkstalkers at the Internet Movie Database *Darkstalkers at TV.com Category:1990s American animated television series Category:1995 American television series debuts Category:1995 American television series endings Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:American television shows based on video games Category:Animated series based on video games Category:Darkstalkers Category:Television series based on Arthurian legend Category:Works based on Capcom video games Category:English-language television shows Category:ADV Films ","title":"Darkstalkers (TV series)"},{"id":"35471579","title":"ICAC Investigators"},{"id":"35471591","text":"The 1976‚Äì77 Scottish First Division season was won by St Mirren, who were promoted along with Clydebank to the Premier Division.

The current head is bishop Timotei Seviciu. History Eastern Orthodox metropolitanates and eparchies in Austria-Hungary in 1909. History of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity on the territory of the present-day bishopric is very long and dates back to late Antiquity and early Middle Ages. The Eparchy of Arad in its modern form was created after the Austro-Turkish war (1683-1699), in 1706 when the city of Arad and its region became part of Habsburg Monarchy. During 18th century and up to the middle of 19th century, Bishopric of Arad was under jurisdiction of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci. Eparchy of Arad also had an important regional vicariate (exarchate) in the city of Oradea. Majority of Eastern Orthodox Christians of this Eparchy were ethnic Romanians and minority were ethnic Serbs and Greeks. Following the will of the majority of people, the Eparchy of Arad was transferred in 1865 from jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Karlovci to the jurisdiction of the newly created Metropolis of Sibiu. The Eastern Orthodox Romanians of the Patriarchate of Karlovci separated and were transferred to the newly created Metropolis of Sibiu through mutual agreement that included the transfer of the Eparchy of Arad and eastern parts of eparchies of Temi≈°var and Vr≈°ac. After World War I and the creation of united Romania, it became part of the united Romanian Orthodox Church. In 2009, the bishopric was elevated to an archbishopric under the Metropolis of Banat.

The Freiberg is an example of post-war architecture in Victoria featuring a -storey geometric structure with a modified cruciform plan. Featured on the cover of Best Australian Houses (1961), edited by Neil Clerehan, the Freiberg house was significant for its use of traditional Australian forms and materials, combined with the Melbourne post-war interest in avant-garde planning, forms and structure. It is also notable for having the first entirely native garden planned by Edna Walling, with whom Chancellor and Patrick was a long-time collaborator.  Description  Freiberg House Plans The Freiberg house is a -storey exposed brick house featuring an axial 'T' plan with low-pitched gable roofs, horizontal bands of windows and its distinctive broad overhanging exposed timber eaves. Each arm of the T serves as a different function: sleeping and bathrooms; living room; or kitchen/dining. At the lowest level are entry, carports/garage and bedsitting room for guests with its own toilet which also serves the hallway. The entry into the house is through two exposed brick piers which lead through the carport to the main entrance. The second level, the main living space, the long arm of the T contains three bedrooms one with its own bathroom and the other two share an elaborate divided bathroom; designed to accommodate the growing Freiberg family. The main living room is projected outwards towards the street with two of the sides opening out onto the terrace. The middle floor features a high vaulted ceiling and cathedral window above the door allowing for natural light to penetrate through the main living spaces. Towards the rear wing of the T are the kitchen and dining areas which is glazed on three of its sides, the other opening to the kitchen. On the upper floor is a private study with windows on all walls allowing for natural light and providing views of the surrounding Studley Park. The construction of the Freiberg house is predominately brick with sections most notably the balconies and spandrils rendered. A key part of the design was the use of exposed Oregon purlins and brickwork as it was considered avant-garde during the time of construction. The perfection of the house's central brick wall bears witness to the meticulousness of the architect as the first was demolished and rebuilt. Within the house, a range of unadorned timbers was chosen to help reflect the native palette of the landscape creating a harmony between the inside and outside spaces. The landscape designed by Edna Walling is a completely Australian native garden featuring a bluestone wall, built by Eric Hammond, towering gumtrees and other indigenous plants.  Key influences and design approach  Chancellor and Patrick mediated modernism with concern for the region and site. Their approach to architecture saw the revival Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian house principles between the 1950s and 1960s. Usonian architecture grew out of Frank Lloyd Wright's earlier Prairie style homes which featured low roofs and open living areas. The style made use of brick, wood, and other natural material. Influenced by the Usonian style, the Freiberg House saw the use of exposed brick and natural Australian timbers. The broad eaves recall not only Melbourne houses of Walter Burley Griffin, but also Californian houses of Harwell Hamilton Harris using similar technique of exposing the purlin beams beyond line of the house. Oregon joinery detailing in the Freiberg house suggest Japanese inspiration influencing for fittings and colour scheme within the house.

More precisely, let T be a rooted tree with n nodes, and let v be an arbitrary node of T. The level ancestor query LA(v,d) requests the ancestor of node v at depth d, where the depth of a node v in a tree is the number of edges on the shortest path from the root of the tree to node v. It is possible to solve this problem in constant time per query, after a preprocessing algorithm that takes O(n) and that builds a data structure that uses O(n) storage space. Naive methods Level ancestor of (v,2) and the path from root r to the node v. The simplest way to find a level ancestor of a node is to climb up the tree towards the root of the tree. On the path to the root of the tree, every ancestor of a node can be visited and therefore reported. In this case, the tree does not need to be preprocessed and the time to answer a query is O(h), where \\"h\\" is the height of the tree. This approach is not feasible in situations where the tree may have large height and a large number of a queries are required to be processed. Alternatively, all the possible solutions can be precomputed and stored in a table. In this case, the queries can be answered in O(1) but the space and the preprocessing time is O(n2). The simplest queries that can be answered in constant time without any preprocessing are LA(v, 0) and LA(v, depth(v)). In the former case, the answer is always the root of the tree and in the latter case, the answer is the node v itself. Each of these results takes O(1). Storing the paths through the tree in a skew binary random access list allows the tree to still be extended downward one O(1) step at a time, but now allows the search to proceed in O(log(p)), where \\"p\\" is the distance from v to the requested depth. This approach is feasible when the tree is particularly wide or will be extended online and so can't be effectively preprocessed, as the storage and access time is purely determined by path length. Jump pointer algorithm The jump pointer algorithm pre-processes a tree in O(n log n) time and answers level ancestor queries in O(log n) time. The jump pointer algorithm associates up to log n pointers to each vertex of the tree. These pointers are called jump pointers because they jump up the tree towards the root of the tree. For a given node v of a tree, the algorithm stores an array of length l jumpers where \\\\ell=\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2(\\\\operatorname{depth}(v))\\\\rfloor. The ith element of this array points to the 2ith ancestor of v. Using such data structure helps us jump halfway up the tree from any given node. When the algorithm is asked to process a query, we repeatedly jump up the tree using these pointers. The number of jumps will be at most log n and therefore queries can be answered in log n time. Ladder algorithm The ladder algorithm is based on the idea of simplifying a tree into a collection of paths. The reason for this is the fact that paths are easier to be queried when it comes to level ancestor queries. Consider a path P consisting of n nodes rooted at a node r. We can store the path into an array of size n called Ladder and we can quickly answer a level ancestor query of LA(v, d) by returning Ladder[d] if depth(v)‚â§d. This will take O(1). However, this will only work if the given tree is a path. Otherwise, we need to decompose it into paths. This is done in two stages: long-path decomposition and extending the long paths into ladders. = Stage 1: long-path decomposition = This is a recursive method that decomposes a given tree into paths. This stages starts off by finding the longest root-to- leaf path in the tree. It then removes this path by breaking its ties from the tree which will break the remaining of the tree into sub-trees and then it recursively processes each sub-tree. Every time a path is decomposed, an array is created in association with the path that contains the elements on the path from the root to the leaf. The base case of this recursion is when the tree is a path in which case its removal leaves an empty graph. Each vertex v has a unique ladder which is the ladder containing it and we call it the \\"v's ladder\\". However, after this pre-processing stage, the queries cannot be answered quickly. In fact in order to answer a level ancestor query, the algorithm needs to jump from a path to another until it reaches the root and there could be Œò() of such paths on a leaf-to-root path. This leads us to an algorithm that can pre-process the tree in O(n) time and answers queries in O(). In order to reach the optimal query time, we need to process the results in a second stage described below. = Stage 2: extending the long paths into ladders = The first stage of the algorithm decomposes the tree into a number of disjoint paths. In the second stage of the algorithm, each path is extended and therefore the resulting paths will not be mutually exclusive. In the first stage of the algorithm, each path is associated with an array of size h' . We extend this path by adding the h' immediate ancestors at the top of the path in the same array. This will extend each array twice its original size at most which will result in 2n total number of nodes in all the ladders. Notice that the number of ladders is not changed and each node's ladder remains the same. Although a node v can be listed in multiple paths now but its ladder is the one that was associated to v in the first stage of the algorithm. These two stages can be processes in O(n) but the query time is not constant yet. Consider a level ancestor query on a node u of height h. By travelling to the top of u's ladder, a vertex of height at least 2h will be reached. Observe that all the nodes have a height of at least 1 and therefore after doing this i times, we reach a node of height at least 2i and therefore we need to do this at most log n times. This gives us a query time of O(log n). = Stage 3: combining the two approaches= It turns out that the ladder algorithm does not do the trick on its own. In fact the jump pointer algorithm and the ladder algorithm complement one another. The two algorithms work in opposite directions: the jump pointer algorithm makes exponentially decreasing hops and the ladder algorithm makes exponentially increasing hops. A combination of the two algorithms can answer queries in O(1) time. A single jump pointer takes any query at least halfway up the tree after which climbing up only one ladder will answer the query. This results in O(n log n) pre-processing time and O(1) query time. The pre-processing can be further reduced to O(n) time by an application of the Method of Four Russians, in which the tree is reduced to a smaller tree with linear preprocessing, and a collection of very small trees, which are small enough that an exhaustive enumeration of all trees and the preprocessing of those trees is still O(n) time. Trees of size (log n)/4 suffice.  Berkman and Vishkin's solution  A different solution is due to Berkman and Vishkin. This solution is based on the Euler tour technique for processing trees. The main observation is that LA(v,d) is the first node of depth d that appears in the Euler tour after the last appearance of v. Thus, by constructing the Euler tour and associated information on depth, the problem is reduced to a query on arrays, named find smaller (FS). For an array A, and a valid index i, FS(i,x) returns the first index j>i such that A[i]<x (here, we use x=d+1). An efficient solution to the FS problem is hard in general, but easier for the special case that arises from Euler tours; in this case, adjacent elements differ by ¬±1. This idea yields O(1) query time, with a preprocessing algorithm of complexity O(n log n). The preprocessing time is improved to O(n) by an application of the Method of Four Russians.

They visit 5 planets: *1.\\"√ñkenplaneten Zoltzy\\" (\\"The Desert Planet Zoltzy\\"), where they must to find a special moss and are near to be left forever. *2.\\"Skogsplaneten Filione\\" (\\"The Forest Planet Filione\\"), where they must to find a special type of beetle and get Femman as a stowaway. *3.\\"Grottplaneten Zeryj\\" (\\"The Cave Planet Zeryj\\"), where they find a special type of fisk and are attacked by \\"Grottmonstret\\" (\\"the Cave monster\\"). *4.\\"Havsplaneten Zinij\\" (\\"The Sea Planet Zinij\\"), where they must get a pod from a carnivorous plant and are attacked by one who shoots Glen with a dart so he becomes comatose for five days. *5.\\"Domedagsplaneten Krasnyj\\" (\\"The Judgment Day Planet Krasnyj\\"), where they must find a cylinder containing the entire history of planet and are attacked by \\"mutants\\" (\\"mutant\\" in singular). One of them becomes beamed up to the space ship and follows them back home to the Earth in the end. Because they worked well together, they could complete the missions and return to Earth. Alien, who disappeared in the end out into space, gave them the missions for \\"att ge v√•r planet och m√§nskligheten en ny chans att √∂verleva\\" (\\"giving our planet and the humans a new chance to survive\\"). In this TV series viewers could call the program and help the characters; for example, someone told them that \\"nedstr√•lningsplatsen var vid den brutna antennen som Peo kastade\\" (\\"the down-beaming place was at the broken antenna which Peo threw\\") when they needed help on \\"Sandplaneten\\". The next summer Vintergatan 5a was followed up by Vintergatan 5b. =Selected cast= *Philom√©ne Grandin as Mira *Wilson D.

It followed up Vintergatan 5a which was broadcast as \\"Sommarlovsmorgon\\" the year before, and even in this TV series, viewers could call the program, for example when the characters needed help. =Plot= Peo's wife Ulla has disappeared and he tells Mira, Glen, and Henrik to follow him out into space to try to find her. When they visit \\"Lavaplaneten\\" (\\"The Lava Planet\\"), Mira also disappears. In the TV series they also meet new characters, among them Irina Teresjkova (who was beamed up from 1963 in her \\"Sputnik\\"), Benke Bengtsson and Gaia and Garsson (who both work at a \\"rymdmack\\" (\\"space petrol station\\")). They get material which may help them and in the end they know that Mira, and also Sjuan (Femman's younger sister, played by Bodil Ekelund), are kidnapped by \\"figures with hats with lamps\\" called \\"fifuner\\" (\\"fifun\\" in singular) on their planet \\"Karichnivi\\". But Ulla is not there, instead, she has been sitting frozen down in a refrigerator in the machine room of the space ship the whole summer. Femman found her but didn't say it until the end of the adventure because of \\"Ingen fr√•gade\\" (\\"no one asked\\"). The new characters are played by Jonas Sykfont (Femman/Benke Bengtsson/Garsson), Ingela Schale (Irina) and Inga Sarri (Gaia). \\"Gaia\\" is only the title of the space station owner. When Gaia and Garsson quit as owners, Peo and Ulla take over and are called \\"Gaia\\" (\\"Gaior\\" in plural). Again, they go through black holes to complete their mission. They meet dangers on the space ship as down on the planets. They visit 5 planets: *1.\\"Lavaplaneten Tj√•rnyj\\" (\\"The Lava Planet Tjornyj\\"), where they meet the pilgrim Melvis and finds out Mira is being kidnapped. *2.\\"Skogsplaneten Filione\\" (\\"The Forest Planet Filione\\"), where they get to know the kidnappers are called \\"Fifuner\\". *3.\\"Sandplaneten Bely'\\" (\\"The Sand Planet Bely\\"), where they find out the \\"Fun-lab\\" is being moved to another planet. They also meet Kubrik, who lives in a tent. *4.\\"Poolplaneten\\" (\\"The Pool Planet\\"), where they get a map and coordinates towards the lab where their friends are being trapped. They also meet Kubrik's brother, Rubrik, who also lives in a tent with his giant lobster Krak√©n. *5.\\"Labbplaneten Karichnivi\\" (\\"The Lab Planet Karichnivi\\"), where they open all cages with the kidnapped creatures, including Mira and Sjuan. =Citation= Henrik claimed in the 4th program that \\"Yuri Gagarin dog I en flygolycka f√∂r 37 √•r sen\\" (\\"Yuri Gagarin died in a flying accident 37 years ago\\"). But this claim was wrong because he died in 1968 and 2001, 1968 was 33 years ago, not 37. Tillbaka till Vintergatan Tillbaka till Vintergatan (\\"Back to the Milky Way\\") was broadcast in 2003, but has been reprised several times. It is a cropped version of Vintergatan 5a and 5b. Now Peo is Gaia at the space station and he tells Garsson, who visits him, about the adventures during the summers of 2000 and 2001. Vid Vintergatans slut Vid Vintergatans slut (\\"At the end of the Milky Way\\") followed up Vintergatan 5a and 5b and was first broadcast on 30 January 2010, then on Saturdays. It was produced, by Anagram Produktion, during the spring of 2009. =Plot= Vid Vintergatans slut takes place almost 20 years after Vintergatan 5a and 5b. Mira (Philom√©ne Grandin) has now been the mother to the 13-year-old girl Billie (Fanny Ketter) and they live a good life on the Earth. Peo's (Anders Linder) and Ulla's (Christina G√∂ransson) time as \\"Gaior\\" is soon finished, but the calm at Milky Way (\\"Vintergatan\\") is over. Every space figure is threatened. Ulla disappears again and the worried Peo sends the cargo ship pilot Pax (Sanna Persson Halapi) to the Earth for getting Mira who may help him. But instead, Pax by mistake gets Billie, Mira's daughter. Almost at the same time Pax returns to the space station, Peo has been near to be murdered by the \\"fun\\" captain Storm (Per-Axel Gj√∂res) who works in \\"Triumvirate\\" together with Professor (Eva Westerling), Lennartsson (Andr√© Wickstr√∂m) and Greven (Anders Jansson). The storm blows up the space station but Peo saves himself in an emergency capsule before it's too late. They visit 2 planets and one asteroid: *1.\\"Bergsplaneten √úrg√ºp\\" (\\"The Mountain Planet √úrg√ºp\\"), where they meet \\"√ºrg√ºpper\\" (in English \\"√ºrg√ºps\\") and find the Palace of the Count.

It was designed by architect Philip Harmer and constructed by Gavin Constructions in 2003. It provides 1398 burial spaces for the Italian community. Plan The mausoleum consists of five angled galleries that are positioned around an open courtyard and two reflection pools. The five galleries are St. Anthony, Our Lady, Holy Trinity, Sacred Heart and the Archangel Gabriel. Each gallery is separated from one another by using different types of stone and ceiling finishes adorned with handcrafted religious mosaics to offer choice for buyers. The blue stone pavement of the gallery, ceramic mosaics and the distinct palette of material finishes elude a welcoming and comfortable presence to visitors. Precast concrete panels engineered by Gutterridge Haskins & Davey, are specially shaped into ‚Äúwings‚Äù to form the external colonnades of the mausoleum to provide maximum lighting and exposure to prevailing winds. Also, the series of semi-enclosed galleries due to cut-out profiles provides views to the interstitial gardens and water features for all galleries. Subsequently, a play of light and shadow is formed across the interior spaces from the cut-outs, inviting contemplation to visitors. (book) The mausoleum houses a total of 1398 casket spaces that are distributed throughout three different types of rooms ‚Äì single, pair and family rooms. Quality Italian marble adorned crypts are positioned next to the sea of coloured glass windows to allow the caskets to bathe under beautifully coloured lights throughout different times of the day. Moreover,families who desire to be buried together are able to go for an individual room with a burial space of up to 10 family members at one particular section of the mausoleum. Furthermore, statues, mementoes and special keepsakes are displayed in the fully lockable, glass fronted personal memory showcases. Key Influences and design approach The brief given to Harmer Architects was to create a new 1400-crypt mausoleum at the Springvale Botanical Cemetery in Melbourne, Australia. The mausoleum would be the second major community mausoleum to be located within the cemetery. Rather than following the tradition of an Australian style of cemetery architecture, architect Philip Harmer decided to break the conventionality by incorporating a more contemporary approach to cemetery architecture. He started investigating contemporary mausoleum designs and it bore undesirable results, with the exception of a particular one in Spain by Enrique Miralles. The critical aspect to this project, according to Harmer, was the orientation of the spaces. . By re-defining what a mausoleum should be, Harmer stressed that the mausoleum should not be totally enclosed, but otherwise, it should be partially opened to the landscape elements and water features. In conjunction with the semi-enclosed idea, Harmer also intended to distinguish the five galleries from one another. By opting for a more durable and monumental material - standard precast concrete, Harmer successfully portrayed a dramatic monumentality of the building form and defined the spaces within the structure effectively. The advantages of precast concrete panels also allow Harmer to experiment with different shapes, colours and finishes to produce an individual statement for each gallery in the mausoleum. Harmer said although the mausoleum is intended to break the tradition, it does possess a strong link to past. The juxtaposition between the definitive monumental character of the adjacent neoclassical edifice and the irregularly aligned intersecting linear spaces that has no beginning nor end successfully creates a more comforting environment in which to grieve. =Awards= The Luciano Rossetti Mausoleum won the Institutional Architecture 2006 RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards. The Luciano Rossetti Mausoleum has been judged the national winner of the 2007 Cement Concrete and Aggregates Australia (CCAA) Public Domain Awards based on its breakthrough in Australian cemetery architecture.

Directed by Harry Beaumont, the production is based on the play The Rear Car by Edward E. Rose. David Townsend was the film's art director. Plot This is the story of Los Angeles switchboard operator Ruth Raymond (Mary Carlisle). She learns from lawyer Alden Murray (Porter Hall) that she is actually the daughter of railroad tycoon Luke Carson (Berton Churchill). She had been kidnapped as a baby by Luke's brother and partner Elwood, and placed with strangers. Once it is found out that she is an heiress, there is an attempt on her life by her bodyguard and chauffeur, which is foiled by Godfrey Scott (Charles Ruggles). A telegram from her father is intercepted and replaced, telling her to meet him in New York instead of Los Angeles, and that a private train car has been arranged. Ruth, Murray, and her best friend Georgia Latham (Una Merkel) board the train bound for New York. In the private car, the lights go out and an announcement is heard, \\"Eight hours to live\\", after which Scott introduces himself to Ruth and her friends as a sleuth who prevents crime. Scott reunites Ruth with her boyfriend John Blake (Russell Hardie), who has stowed away. Then the train is suddenly stopped until the wreck of a circus train on the tracks is cleared. Murray is murdered and \\"Five hours to live\\" is announced. Then an escaped circus gorilla attacks Ruth, Georgia, and Scott before jumping from the train to its death. The next morning, the train stops in the same small town where Luke Carson's train has also stopped. He has been tipped off by a radio message to meet her. Now with no reason to go to Los Angeles, her father joins Ruth's party in the private car. Then one by one all the windows are blackened and the lights put out, and a voice informs the passengers that the private car is about to be uncoupled from the train and will roll backwards downhill towards another train, the Limited; and a secret panel is opened, showing concealed explosives that will make sure no one survives the crash. Luke Carson recognizes the sinister voice as that of his brother Elwood, who is in fact the conductor in charge of the private car. Elwood confirms his identity and says Luke once cheated him. Scott finds and kills Elwood, then finds a radio transmitter on the car and uses it to broadcast a warning of the imminent collision and explosion. The Limited's engineers hear the broadcast and reverse their train, but this also risks a collision since a freight train is following it. Fortunately there is a conveniently located railway yard where quick-thinking railwaymen can throw switches to send the Limited, the freight, and the runaway private car onto three separate tracks. Then they dispatch a locomotive to catch up with the runaway car, warning its engineer about the explosives. Rather than coupling to the car, the engineer pulls close to it so that everyone on board can jump onto the front platform of the steam locomotive. Then he stops the locomotive, just before the runaway car derails on a curve and explodes. When everyone gets off to look, Scott and Georgia embrace. Cast * Charles Ruggles as Godfrey D.

The official name of the camp is Kyo-hwa-so No. 9 (Reeducation camp no. 9). The sub-facility for women is sometimes called Kyo-hwa-so No. 15.  Location  The camp is located in Humhung city, in South Hamgyong province of North Korea. The main facility for male prisoners is situated in Hoesang- dong, about northeast of downtown Hamhung. The sub-facility for female prisoners is across the railway station near Songwon-ri, a little village about northeast of the city center. Smaller sub-facilities are in Chongpyong county and in Kowon county, both also in South Hamgyong province.  Description  Hamhung concentration camp consists of five departments: * The 1st and 2nd departments are located in the main facility. Around 1,500 male prisoners have to produce Ssangma sewing machines and repair them. The building was erected as a colonial prison during the period of Japanese Occupation (1910 ‚Äì 1945). It was later used as a factory and then as a prison factory since the 1990s. * The 3rd department in Songwon-ri is a prison farm with livestock facilities, rice paddies and vegetable patches, where 500 female prisoners have to work. It was erected in 1998 mainly for defectors. * The 4th department in Chongpyong-gun is a gold mine. The number of prisoners there is unknown. * The 5th department in Kowon-gun is a coal mine. The number of prisoners there is unknown. Besides some common criminals there are many political prisoners, especially repatriated refugees in the camp.  Living conditions  Many prisoners sleep on straw and grass. In the 1st department prisoners sleep on the factory bridges to avoid the lice-infested concrete floor. Food rations are very small and prisoners are always hungry. They only get some steamed corn and a watery cabbage soup or some bean porridge, but no salt or protein. In order to survive, the prisoners eat raw mice, snakes, frogs and insects they can find or grass, tree leaves or bark. Some prisoners even eat undigested beans or corn kernels from cow dung, although they are punished when detected. Ill prisoners still have to work to avoid beatings and reduced food rations. There is just one military doctor in the prison, no medical devices and almost no medicine. Prisoners often get infected when getting injections.  Working conditions  Former prisoners said they had to work from 5:00 a. m. (except in winter) to 7:00 p. m. with only two breaks. In the 3rd department women have to do hard farm work with poor and inadequate tools regardless of the weather. After dinner all prisoners have to attend re- education and mutual criticism sessions, often until 10:00 p.m. If prisoners fail to memorize the teachings of Kim Il-sung, their prison term is extended. The prison is surrounded by an electric fence and the prisoners are guarded by security officers 24 hours day and night.  Human rights violations  Former prisoners reported that inmates look like skeletons barely covered with skin or skinny sticks with big heads. In case prisoners do not meet their work quota or violate rules (e. g. if they steal food) they are severely kicked or beaten with rifle butts or wooden sticks. One of the witnesses described how she was beaten more than 30 times, though her head was injured and her ears and nose were bleeding. Another common punishment is the significant reduction of food rations. Prisoners in solitary confinement get almost no food. In 2003 a former prisoner witnessed a public execution by firing squad with all prisoners gathered to watch. Witnesses testified that in winter 1999/2000 around 500 prisoners died in six months Many of them died in hard and dangerous work, when a tunnel from Hamhung concentration camp to Oro concentration camp was dug. Bang Mi-sun reported that during her 18-month prison term around 20% of prisoners in her work group and in other work groups died. Corpses are burnt in large quantities in a furnace. Female prisoners are often sexually assaulted and sometimes raped by security officers. Pregnant women are taken outside the prison to get forced abortions.  Prisoners (witnesses)  * Bang Mi-sun (2000 ‚Äì 2001 in Hamhung) was repatriated from China for illegal border-crossing. * An unidentified former prisoner (female, 1998 - 2000 in Hamhung) gave testimony to Anti-Slavery International about the camp. She was repatriated from China and imprisoned for illegal border crossing. * Eight other unidentified former prisoners (seven female, one male; between 1998 and 2007 in Hamhung) were interviewed by the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights. Most of them do not want to be identified for fear that their relatives in North Korea are punished.

He was ruled out for two games with an injury but scored a try against Cardiff Blues to make him known a young talent. He scored once again in the 23‚Äì10 win over Aironi. During the 2010‚Äì11 season, Gilroy's club, Dungannon RFC, came fifth. In 2011‚Äì12 he scored his first try against Aironi, and then scored against Connacht Rugby in a 22‚Äì3 win. He then scored in a 30‚Äì12 win over Newport Gwent Dragons to have his Pro12 try number at 3. He also scored 3 times in the Heineken Cup. He scored tries in pool play against Aironi and Leicester Tigers. Gilroy made the news with the try that gave Ulster a 22‚Äì16 win in the quarterfinals against Munster at Thomond Park to send Ulster through to the Heineken Cup semi final. This try won him the IRUPA award in 2012. He also played in Ulster's 42‚Äì14 loss to Leinster in the 2012 Heineken Cup final. Gilroy was also nominated for Irish Young Player of the Year for the 2011‚Äì12 season, but that award went to Munster back row Peter O‚ÄôMahony. He was also named Ulster young player of the year.

The epsilon axe was widely used throughout the Middle East, its usage spread from there and grew in popularity to be used in eastern Europe and Russia as well as the Nordic countries. The axe is also depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphics with the warrior carrying both the epsilon axe and a shield thus leaving some to believe that this weapon was used also as a one handed weapon. Bronze examples of the Assyrian design are kept in the British Museum. Some historians have called the epsilon axe the \\"poor man's\\" kopesh, it is possible that the epsilon axe would be assigned to less valuable or \\"irregular\\" infantry while main forces would be equipped with the kopesh. The axe head was made out of either bronze or copper and it was then fitted on to the haft using tangs. The structure of the weapon made its ability to penetrate armour very weak so it would mainly be used against weakly armoured opponents. With the Bardiche the head of the axe is usually affixed to the haft near the middle or bottom, however in almost all versions of the epsilon axe the blade is attached at three different points: top, middle, bottom. These tangs would be wedged into the grooves of the heft. Then they would be lashed down to ensure a sturdy fit. The epsilon axe is somewhat more limited than the Bardiche axe in that while sharing the same basic design it lacks a point that extends beyond the reach of the haft. This makes it unable to be used as a thrusting weapon, instead only relying on the power of the swing from the combatant. The edge of blade has taken on many different types of shape but the general construction of it has remained the same over time.

It has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years. Iron, steel, and ferrous metals constitute a large portion of collections in museums. The conservation and restoration of iron and steel objects is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from iron or steel. When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer. Historically, objects made from iron or steel were created for religious, artistic, technical, military and domestic uses. Though it is generally not possible to completely halt deterioration of any object, the act of conservation and restoration strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. One of the first steps in caring for iron is to examine them and determine their state, determine if they are corroding, and consider options for treatment. C. (2019, February 22). Care and Cleaning of Iron ‚Äì Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 9/6. Retrieved from https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation- institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian- conservation-institute-notes/care-iron.html The prevention and removal of surface dirt and corrosion products are some of the primary concerns of conservator-restorers when dealing with iron or steel objects, including nickel-iron meteorites. Conservation and restoration of iron and steel may begin with analysis of the environment that the objects will be stored and displayed in. Preventive conservation and understanding the agents of deterioration that affect the specific object are often considered some of the important first steps.The Field Museum. (2018, June 14). Preventive Conservation. Retrieved from https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/conserving- collections/preventive-conservation A prerequisite for conservation and restoration of not only iron and steel, but also all collections items is systematic and well-managed, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment.ICON. (n.d.). Blog: Why conservators need good documentation. Retrieved from https://icon.org.uk/news/blog-why- conservators-need-good-documentation Identification of materials and procedures used to produce objects and the results of any scientific research must be part of documentation, too. Last but not least, an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object. Once thorough documentation, analysis, and discussion has occurred, possible treatment techniques can be considered and performed on the objects. Identification Processes and Analysis Analysis and observation of collections objects when considering treatment and restoration occurs at all steps of the conservation process. Metal objects such as iron and steel share properties such as strength, conduction of heat and electricity, structure and more. It is important to understand the properties before conducting treatment. Recognizing the specific metal or alloy and construction of the object can help determine their susceptibility to corrosion and can narrow down which conservation measures can be used. Canadian Conservation Institute. (2018, December 14). Caring for metal objects. Retrieved from https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/preventive- conservation/guidelines-collections/metal-objects.html Once the structure and composition of the object has been observed and identified, conservator- restorers can determine the state. Surface dirt and corrosion are among the most common issues with iron and steel objects. Throughout the analysis and identification process, conservator-restorers keep clear and detailed notes. This allows them to document the past, present and future of the object for use later. These notes include the observations as mentioned above as well as the recommendations for treatment. *Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity *Scientific methods - XRF, XRD, Particle-induced X-ray emission, LIBS, SEM, electrochemical techniques, metallography *Simple method - visual examination, spot tests *The Oddy test - for copper, silver, and lead *Scientific methods - xrd, SEM, metallography =Identification of materials associated with metals= *Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity *Scientific methods - xrf, chromatography =Identification of technology used to produce objects= *Simple methods - visual examination *Scientific methods - metallography, x-ray radiography, x-ray computed tomography  Treatment  =Treatment Considerations= When determining the best course of action in the treatment of a steel or iron object great care must be taken. The person treating the object is likely a conservator, restorer, curator, archaeologist or collections manager, though private collectors may choose to treat their own collections. A conservator with training in metals and objects would be the best choice for treating steel and iron objects. The safety and longevity of the object is the highest priority, ensuring the treatment will not cause further damage. Consideration must be given to the structural integrity, artist intent, and original context. By following the Code of Ethics by AIChttps://www.culturalheritage.org/docs/default- source/administration/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for- practice.pdf?sfvrsn=21 the treatment plan will aid a conservator in making an informed and safe decision for treatment. = Cleaning = Cleaning should be determined after a condition report is completed and photographs are taken. Any previous repairs should be documented and reviewed prior to new treatment. The proposed cleaning method needs to be justified by the condition and desired end results of the object. Potential risks should be mentioned in the treatment report and justified as acceptable risk. Before cleaning and/or treatment occurs, the conservator-restorer should consult curators and experts in the field to gain perspective on the possible ramifications of action. * Mechanical cleaning *Scalpel *HEPA Vacuum *Cloth (moist or dry) *Cotton Swab * Aqueous cleaning *H2O - Deionized, Reverse Osmosis, or Distilled *Detergents * Chemical cleaning *Sodium Bicarbonate * Flitz Paste Polish * Maas *Mineral Spirits *Solvents *Ultrasonic Painted objects Painted objects can be cleaned with polar solvents (acetone, ethanol) and non polar solvents (hexanes and toluene) or solvent mixtures (xylene ). When working with solvents a conservator will use best practices in health and safety. The use of personal protection equipment is recommended. Structural consolidation The treatment report will indicate what type of structural treatment should be used. If the item is missing hardware it can be replaced by adding matching or similar screws and rivets. Adhesives, soldering, and welding can be used to repair a damaged structure. Protective coatings Protective coatings can be good options for iron and steel objects. They help retain original appearance and protect against foreign bodies such as moisture and debris that can cause rust or corrosion. *Clear coatings - Permalac \\\\- Ormocer \\\\- Paraloid B-72 *Waxes - Renaissance Wax - Cosmolloid 80 H \\\\- Dinitrol 4010 \\\\- Poligen ES 91009 *Oils - Ballistol - WD-40 *Lacquers *Enamels Archaeological objects Archaeological objects made from steel and iron are man made and often constructed as tools.

After a period in the surgical department at Rikshospitalet from 1893 to 1896 he served as chief physician at Stavanger Hospital from 1897 until his death. At Rikshospitalet he is credited with performing the first surgery on a human heart on 4 September 1895. The patient needed emergency surgery due to a knife wound. Cappelen accessed the thoracic cavity by cutting through the fourth rib. He repaired the wound of the left ventricle where he has sustained the stab wounds in the left side of his chest. After two days of intensive care, the patient died of coronary occlusion and not because of the repairing of the heart. At the autopsy the wound was found to be satisfactorily closed.

This approach could have applicability between 5-13% of the DMD population. In addition to its clinical trials, Prosensa were running a Natural History Study, which has completed enrollment with 269 patients across the US, Europe and Latin America. The purpose of this study was to characterize the natural history and progression of DMD, to help inform the design of future studies, to capture biomarkers of safety and disease progression and to provide comparative data for the development of rare exons for which formal controlled trials are not feasible.

She was one of the first women councillors in London, the first woman mayor in London and the first Labour woman mayor in the British Isles. Life Born on 20 July 1866 in Raunds, Northamptonshire, with sisters Mary, Beatrice, Alice and Adelaide and brother Richard who became a Methodist minister in Lancaster, Ada Brown was active in the Methodist church and on the radical wing of the Liberal Party before she joined the West London Mission in Bloomsbury to work as a 'Sister of the People' in the slums of St Pancras. The Sisters were run by Katherine Hughes, an inspirational Christian socialist, but in 1897, after the marriage of her sister Mary Baldwin, Ada transferred to the Bermondsey Settlement. There she met Alfred Salter, agnostic and socialist, a resident engaged in medical research into infectious diseases on a farm in Sudbury (now Wembley), Middlesex. Under her influence Alfred converted to Christianity and joined the Liberal Party. They both committed to the Society of Friends (Quakers) and started to attend the Deptford Meeting. They were married in Raunds on 22 August 1900. Ada had always insisted on living in the slums, among the poor, ever since arriving in London. Now she was equally insistent on staying in Bermondsey, a place she had fallen in love with despite its drab poverty. Alfred, who was such a brilliant doctor he could have made a fortune as a consultant, therefore set up a GP's medical practice in Jamaica Road. He charged poorer patients only a small sum and the poorest nothing at all. Ada continued as a social worker at Bermondsey Settlement, where she already had a high reputation for the clubs she ran, especially those for the \\"roughest and toughest\\" of the teenage girls. In 1902 she temporarily gave up work when the couple's only child, Ada Joyce, was born. Ada was President of the Women's Liberal Party in Bermondsey and Rotherhithe but in 1906 she left the Liberal Party when it failed to honour its promise of granting the vote to women and soon joined the ILP (Independent Labour Party). The ILP was the political party most favourable to the rights of women and wanted to stand women candidates, including Ada, at the next council elections. This put Alfred, a Liberal councillor on the London County Council (LCC), into an awkward position. In 1908 therefore he also left the Liberals, to found an ILP branch in Bermondsey. Once again it was Ada who had blazed the trail for him to follow. In November 1909 Ada was elected to the borough council for the ILP, becoming the first woman councillor in Bermondsey, first Labour councillor in Bermondsey, and one of the first women councillors in London. However, in 1910, personal tragedy struck when the Salters' daughter, Joyce, only eight years old, died of scarlet fever in one of the periodic epidemics that swept through the slums, having been infected twice before. Joyce's photo was daily decorated with flowers and ivy leaves in Alfred's study. Ada responded by throwing herself into the work of the Women's Labour League, which she had co- founded in 1906 with Margaret MacDonald, wife of Labour's rising star, James Ramsay MacDonald. She rose to be first its National Treasurer and then in 1914 its National President, the leader of all the Labour Party women in Britain. The WLL was not tied to any particular suffragist movement but Ada supported the non-violent Women's Freedom League, led by her friend Charlotte Despard, rather than endorse the tactics of the Women's Social and Political Union led by Emmeline Pankhurst. In the WLL Ada did pioneering research work on social housing, seeking not only to demolish the slums but to put in their place model council houses (often derided by her opponents as utopian) built specifically with the needs of working-class women in mind. To expedite demolition, she and her WLL comrades called for a Green Belt around London, to absorb the excess population from the slums. Ada followed John Ruskin in believing that fresh air and contact with nature improved people not only physically but mentally and morally. She became a proponent of urban gardening, and a pioneer of organised campaigning against air pollution in London. What brought her the greatest renown before 1914 was, however, the Bermondsey Uprising of 1911. She had in 1910 started to recruit women in the local factories to a women's trade union organisation, the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW), led by Mary Macarthur. At first the results were disappointing but suddenly in August 1911, 14,000 women walked out on strike in protest against terrible working conditions. They won. Ada was hailed by the ILP and the WLL as the inspiration of this big step forward for women's rights at work (though she was only one factor) and for this, as well as for the huge organisational effort including what we would now consider as family food banks during the dockers' strike of 1912, she was honoured by the trade unions which are known today as Unite and the GMB. Ada spoke out for equality among workers: male/female and young or old not just in the workplace but in the labour movement: > ‚ÄúWhen the trades union movement fully realises that all the workers, men and > women, youth and maidens, were members one of another, then they will hear > more than the rumble of revolution in the distance, the revolution will be > here.‚Äù Ada had always since her youth opposed war and becoming a Quaker had fortified her commitment to peace. For her, therefore, 1914 was a catastrophe. She was a founding member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and from 1916 she also worked with Alfred for the No Conscription Fellowship. Although the British government prevented her from attending the Hague peace conference in 1915, she managed to reach Bern, Switzerland, as the representative of the ILP, to attend a conference of socialist women opposed to the war. There she came up against Lenin, who was determined to get the conference to vote for armed revolution. Ada and the WLL delegate, Margaret Bondfield, stood their ground and Lenin was defeated. At the end of the war she was amongst the British delegations to the Women's International League congresses in Z√ºrich and Vienna. Her international position was that of the Vienna International, which tried to mediate between the Second International (Labour) and the Third (Communist) but failed to reconcile them. Ada opens a playground by planting a tree. Alfred is on her left. Re-elected to Bermondsey Council in 1919, Ada was appointed Mayor of Bermondsey in 1922, making her the first woman mayor in London and first Labour woman mayor in Britain. Ada refused all the trappings of mayoral insignia or robes, and replaced the Union Jack with a red flag with symbols of Bermondsey, St Olave and Rotherhithe on the town hall. She had launched in 1920 her famous Beautification Committee and now she launched her housing campaign, demolishing the slums that could be demolished and beautifying the slums that could not. By the 1930s she had planted 9000 trees, decorated buildings with window-boxes, and filled all open spaces with flowers, some 60,000 plants. Looking not only for beautification of streets but for beautification of every individual's body, mind and soul, she organised all over the borough music concerts, art competitions, games, sports and children's playgrounds. After a fierce political battle she built her beautiful 'utopian' council houses in Wilson Grove, where they still stand today as exemplary housing. Her electoral results were phenomenal, regularly achieving the highest vote of any councillor in London. When her time in office was over she had hardly spent any of the mayoral 'expenses' allowance. At the 1925 London County Council election, she was elected to represent Hackney South. In 1932 she was elected National President of the National Gardens Guild. Finally, in 1934, when Labour led by Herbert Morrison took control of the LCC, Ada was able to spread her green socialist ideals to every corner of the capital. The Green Belt was secured by law in 1938. The 1939 war was felt to be a catastrophe by Ada just as much as the 1914 war. In 1942, Ada and Alfred were bombed out of their home in Storks Road after refusing to leave Bermondsey to its fate, as others did. She died, cared for by her sisters, in Balham Park Road, Battersea, on 4 December 1942 and was accorded a Quaker funeral at Peckham Meeting-House, where she was an elder. There was also a memorial service at her parish church of St James Bermondsey. Her husband Alfred said a month later: \\"The loneliness grows deeper and has not lessened in the slightest with the lapse of time. Sometimes it is almost unbearable, but I have to learn to bear it.\\"  Personal beliefs  Ada Salter's personal beliefs evolved from the social liberalism of Hugh and Katherine Hughes to the ethical socialism of the ILP. Like Alfred, she was an admirer of Giuseppe Mazzini and of his clarion call for the unity and equality of all humanity. This chimed in with her Quaker belief that \\"there is something of God in everyone.\\" In practice what she meant by 'ethical' was human or humanitarian, and what she meant by 'socialism' was a worldwide network of co-operative enterprises. She believed that people would become truly human only by valuing nature and valuing each other. On valuing nature her famous slogan was: \\"The cultivation of flowers and trees is a civic duty.\\" As for valuing others, she believed this depended not only on individual effort but also entailed the emancipation of women and workers, who ought to be natural allies against oppression. She believed too that ethical socialism secured personal happiness, provided that the ethical socialist followed what was true as well as valuing others: \\"Act according to truth and principle.\\" she advised, \\"If one does that, there will be no need ever to be anxious or distraught.\\" After her death in the Friends (Quakers) Quarterly Examiner it was said: 'Socialism in action: that is what she was.\\" Memorials Ada Salter Garden A beautiful garden, overlooking a lake, designed and supervised by Ada herself, was opened in 1936 within Southwark Park. It was spontaneously referred to by locals as the 'Ada Salter Garden' and in 1943 the name was formally recognised by the LCC. There is also a lecture named after the Salters. Every year the Quaker Socialist Society, the successor to the Socialist Quaker Society to which Ada and Alfred belonged, organises a Salter Lecture, to honour their memory. The Salter statues are a tourist attraction in Rotherhithe. At first there was only a bronze statue of Alfred, erected in 1991, but when it was stolen by metal-thieves in November 2011, there was a campaign to erect statues to both Ada and Alfred, and this raised ¬£120,000. The resulting sculptures, by artist Diane Gorvin, were unveiled on the south bank of the Thames, together with a statue of Joyce, in November 2014. Ada's statue was only the 15th public statue in London to a woman. In 2015 a play about Ada Salter, Red Flag over Bermondsey, by Lynn Morris was performed all over the country.

Her work is very similar in style to that of Norman Rockwell. Biography Hunter was born in Howard, Pennsylvania, to Michael Howard, an insurance salesman, and Laura Tipton. After her mother‚Äôs death, Hunter and her older brother, Harold, moved in with her aunt and uncle Frances and Edward McEntire in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, when she was 5 or 6 years old. Her love of drawing and art began when she was three years old; whenever she visited her grandmother, Hunter drew figures on the wallpaper in the stairway, apparently finding the wallpaper boring and unimpressive. Hunter remarked in an interview that ‚Äúdrawing is a perfectly natural thing, for the first impulse is to express one‚Äôs self, and the easiest way for a child to do this is by pictures.‚Äù She painted her first artwork in the 6th grade at Transeau Elementary School. Titled ‚ÄúWe Bark for Transeau,‚Äù the piece depicted three puppies in a basket. Puppies would become her favorite subject. While attending Williamsport High School, Hunter illustrated for the school‚Äôs Cherry and White publication and played ‚Äúunimpressive basketball,‚Äù according to herself. In 1914, during her senior year, Hunter received first prize in a Williamsport Civic Club essay contest about her three favorite artworks at a James V. Brown Library art exhibition. The judges agreed that she best interpreted the artists‚Äô meaning of the paintings. After graduation, Hunter studied illustration under Thornton Oakley at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art. She then attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial. While studying in Philadelphia, Hunter was hired by John Wanamaker to illustrate a line of children‚Äôs fashion for catalogs and advertisements. She was paid $500. While illustrating in the children‚Äôs fashion industry, Hunter was sent the actual clothes in order to paint the necessary details of the garment accurately. She moved back to Williamsport for about six years, before returning to Philadelphia. While in Williamsport for the 1956 Sesquicentennial, Hunter was named one of the first Pennsylvania ambassadors by the state Chamber of Commerce, and was named ‚ÄúA Distinguished Daughter of Williamsport.‚Äù With an artistic style similar to Norman Rockwell‚Äôs, Hunter‚Äôs watercolors delightfully captured nature at its best. Her favorite subject was children and their pets. Due to her talent and the characters she created, Hunter became the ‚Äúmost popular and best-selling calendar artist‚Äù of the 1940-50s.‚Äù Her memorable subjects were ‚Äúwelcome therapy to millions recovering from the dreariness of WWII.‚Äù In the early 1920s, Hunter created a series of paper dolls that first appeared in Ladies‚Äô Home Journal. After rave reviews and requests, she illustrated six dolls to appear in the regular publications. From the 1930s to the 1940s, Hunter contributed 18 covers to the Saturday Evening Post. In 1946, Hunter was approached by John Baurngarth to do a series of paintings depicting the everyday problems of a little boy and his dog. The series, ‚ÄúSandy in Trouble,‚Äù continued for 11 years, as Hunter created an annual painting to add to the series. During her lifetime, she illustrated and published two books, Random House‚Äôs Boo, Who Used to Be Scared of the Dark, and The Frances Tipton Hunter Picture Book. Whitman Publishing Company of Racine, Wisconsin published The Picture Book, which featured Hunter‚Äôs illustrations and verses/stories by Marjorie Barrows. She was listed in the Who‚Äôs Who in American Art from 1936 to 1956 and was a member of the Society of Illustrators. The Pennsylvania State University, University of Minnesota, James V. Brown Library in Williamsport, and the Thomas T. Taber Museum of the Lycoming County Historical Society all own artworks by Hunter.

Eagle Mount does alpine skiing and snowboarding at Bridger Bowl and Big Sky Resort, and Nordic skiing and snowshoeing at Bohart Ranch. Other programs are hosted on the Eagle Mount campus.  Number of Participants  While the anticipated need in the small town of Bozeman, Montana in the fall of 1982 was around twenty participants, nearly 100 people with disabilities signed up for the first winter of skiing. In 2014, 1,783 participants were assisted by 1,979 volunteers who spent over 30,000 hours with Eagle Mount Bozeman's programs.http://eaglemount.org/wp/wp- content/uploads/2012/03/Point-Paper-Fiscal-Year-2013-2014.pdf  Fundraising  Eagle Mount is a private non-profit organization which does not take government funding, instead relying on private donors, grants, and foundations. In-kind donations such as program equipment, ski passes and rental services, horses and hay, and more also facilitate the variety of programs. Support has come from The M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust and the Dennis and Phyllis Washington Foundation. Three annual events held in support of Eagle Mount Bozeman's programs include the Western Rendezvous, a barn dance and auction fundraiser; the Crystal Ball, a black tie event; and Digger Days, a collaboration with local construction companies to let people of all ages drive heavy equipment with the support of professional operators.  Adaptive Equipment  Eagle Mount serves a wide variety of people with disabilities through a combination of specially trained staff and specialized equipment. The equipment includes mono-skis and bi-skis. These skis either have one or two skis under a specialized seat; a trained volunteer then holds a tether or bar, helping glide the person down the hill. Other specialized equipment includes 'ski legs' for skiers who can stand but need additional support on the hill and handcycles for cyclists with lower body impairments such as a spinal cord injury or amputation.

He has degrees in mathematics, physics, and a masters and PhD in psychology from University of Montana. He is also a classical guitarist, black-belt martial artist, an author, philosopher and worked for many years as an editor for two academic journals of psychology Psychological Reports and Perceptual and Motor Skills. Early years Doug Ammons was born in Missoula, Montana, to Robert B. Ammons and Carol H. Ammons. He grew up surrounded by family and knowledge. Both of his parents have degrees in psychology, his father being a professor at the University of Montana. When he was in his adolescent years, his father would put together science projects for Doug and his siblings to work on, it \\"taught them to have open and investigative minds\\". Their father's assigned projects led the Ammons kids' to several places, like the backcountry of Yellowstone National Park, Coppermine on the Arctic coast, the desert of Oregon, and the Columbia River Gorge. Doug Ammons and his siblings would also hike, backpack, swim and share their experiences together thru poetry. From an early age, Ammons was comfortable in the water; he was paddling lakes and easy local rivers in folding kayaks. He learned to conquer both its currents and depths by becoming scuba certified at the age of 12. Ammons also was a competitive swimmer, making it to nationals several times in high school and then competing in college on the varsity Grizzly team.  Kayaker  Doug Ammons was around 24 when he really started to pick up kayaking. However, he played classical guitar every chance he could before he got into kayaking. \\"I was looking for a different kind of music to play, and I found it in the current and flowing water,\\" said Doug in an interview with Ben Friberg for Steep Creeks about why classical guitar playing led him to kayaking. Ammons was also very inspired by Rob Lesser paddling the Grand Canyon of the Stikine in 1981. For over 25 years, Doug Ammons has been a world class kayaker. He has accomplished many first descents, from the western states of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Ammons also has travelled to many different areas for paddling, like Mexico, the Himalayas, South America, and Canada. Doug Ammons enjoys soloing rivers. In answer to a question asked by Ben Friberg about soloing, Ammons responded saying, \\"The interesting thing is, I'm sure that nearly all serious paddlers solo at some point, mostly because it provides a truly rewarding sense of intimacy with a river\\". The rivers he solos do not consist of just class III; he solos class V, deep gorges where paddlers need to be on top of their game for a successful trip. One river in particular that Doug Ammons soloed was the Grand Canyon of the Stikine. He was part of the second descent in 1990 but then decided he would solo it two years later. Ammons comments later in an interview with the Missoulian, saying, \\"I tried to do the hardest thing I could conceive of, in the purest style possible\\". Doug's solo descent on the Stikine shows commitment and perseverance, the sports ultimate test. Doug Ammons has turned away sponsorship offers from many kayaking companies and also declined the opportunity to have a show with ESPN on a race he founded, a big water race on the North Fork Payette River. Doug is a solid kayaker but is very humble at the same time. He believes kayaking will take paddlers to beautiful places, \\"but only in context.\\" Doug Ammons states in an interview with Michael Moore from The Missoulian: \\"These sports like climbing and kayaking, they have this patina of greatness about them because, frankly, most people can't do them at the highest levels. But they are no greater than what others have done. They don't cure cancer. They don't feed hungry people. They don't provide clean water\\". Author Doug Ammons is a recognized author of books, essays, and articles about kayaking, philosophy of adventures sports, and Montana history. He has written articles for Rapid Magazine, Kayak Session, Canoe & Kayak Magazine, Coast Mountain Culture, and Distinctly Montana. His books include The Laugh of the Water Nymph, Whitewater Philosophy, and, most recently, A Darkness Lit by Heroes. Ammons has given presentations about the topics featured in his books at speaking events throughout the USA and internationally in Europe. Psychologist Doug Ammons followed his parents' footsteps by getting his PhD in psychology. He spent many years working as an editor for the academic journals Psychological Reports and Perceptual and Motor Skills and has contributed his own research within the realm of psychology. His parents started Ammons Scientific, an independent psychological publishing company in Missoula, Montana, in the 1940s. Recognition/Work In Outside Magazine, Ammons was named number seven in the top ten adventurers of the 1900s. He was recognized for running the Stikine solo. Outside even compared him to Reinhold Messner: \\"What Reinhold Messner did for alpinism, Ammons did for paddling\\". With an interview with Kriti Niemeyer for Lively Times, Doug commented about not being a fan of lists, \\"but it is a huge honor to be compared to Reinhold Messner\\". Doug Ammons also contributed to seven documentaries about beautiful rivers; he wrote scripts for four and paddled in all seven. The movies were done for ESPN, National Geographic Channel, and Outdoor Life Network. Out of the seven documentaries, four won Emmys. Also, Doug Ammons \\"won an Emmy award as a cinematographer for a film shot in Bolivia.\\" Most recently he contributed as co-writer and co- producer to an eighth documentary, Anson Fogel's Wildwater. Doug Ammons has written two books about his view and relationship with a sport he loves: The Laugh of the Water Nymph written in 2005, Whitewater Philosophy written in 2009. Ammons's forthcoming work The Stikine will capture the experience of his solo run on the Grand Canyon of the Stikine. Personal life Ammons currently resides in Missoula, MT with his wife Robin Ammons and their children and grandchildren.

This historic site is within the White Mountain National Forest. The stream that flows into this waterfall is called Lucy Brook. The waterfalls were once the location of an old sawmill operation in the 1800s. After the sawmill was abandoned by the Lucy family in the 1940s, it was turned into a historic site that would be protected by the U.S. Forest Service. The total drop of the waterfalls is , and the hike to the base of the waterfall is about . Diana's Baths is now a popular family destination. The intensity of the stream is related to the season; the stream flow is most intense in the springtime because of runoff from the winter snowmelt. Insect repellent is an essential from spring to fall. History stereoscopic, photograph by John P. Soule (1827‚Äì1904) In 1863, George Lucy bought of land on the site of Diana's Baths. The Lucy family had built a sawmill in the middle of the cascading waterfalls. During the year 1890, the owner George Lucy began to notice that his property was attracting tourists. In response to this new flow of tourists he built a boarding house that was three stories tall. His business was not as successful as he thought it would be, because of the other major hotels in the surrounding area. In the 1930s the family moved from having a sawmill to having a concrete dam with turbines. The family abandoned the site when the invention of portable mills was introduced and they could now use it when they moved from timber harvest site to the next. Mrs. Hattie C. Lucy owned the property and operated a gift shop beside the falls through the 1940s with an ice house behind the store to cool the soda that was sold to tourists. Mrs. Lucy and her son David lived in the home through the late 1950s until she sold the house. Mr. DeSimone purchased the home and remaining land and eventually sold it to the government. This is when the land became National Forest land and the remaining buildings were torn down. Location Diana's Baths are located off West Side Road north of the turn to Cathedral Ledge outside of North Conway. The short and mild hike to the base of the waterfall is about from the head of the trail. Past Diana's Baths, the Moat Mountain Trail continues to the summit of North Moat Mountain. Origin of name According to Place Names of the White Mountains by Robert and Mary Julyan, the origin of the name comes from this: \\"These curious circular stone cavities on Lucy Brook originally were known as the Home of the Water Fairies; tradition says evil water sprites inhabited the ledges, tormenting the Sokokis Indians until a mountain god answered the Indians' prayers and swept the sprites away in a flood. But sometime before 1859 a Miss Hubbard of Boston, a guest at the old Mount Washington House in North Conway, rechristened them Diana's Baths, presumably to evoke images of the Roman nature goddess. The pools are also called Lucy's Baths.\\" The name was official when the government purchased the land in the 1960s and made it part of the White Mountain National Forest. Role of the Forest Service In 2005, the U.S. Forest Service conducted an environmental assessment to determine the effect humans have on this preserved land. The impact on the ecosystem was a large amount of waste and human excrement in the area surrounding Lucy Brook. Forest rangers decided to add toilets and trash receptacles to combat these problems, and since then, little to no adverse effect on the environment has been detected.

He was born in Cleveland Heights, Ohio and died in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. According to his obituary, \\"Swann dedicated more than a half century of his life to non- violence, desegregation, appropriate technology, affordable housing, land trusts, community credit, worker cooperatives and local currency\\". Swann was a conscientious objector during World War II and was imprisoned. In 1967, Swann signed a public statement declaring his intention to refuse to pay income taxes in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam.\\"No Income Tax For War!\\" archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive  Community Land Trusts  In 1969 Swann, Slater King, and other civil rights activists founded New Communities, Inc., a 5,600 acre land trust in Lee County, Georgia in order to secure long term community land ownership for landless Southern blacks. In her 2004 Annual E. F. Schumacher Lecture on Swann, Stephanie Mills said: \\"Bob Swann's innovation and formalization of the community land trust is one of his most important contributions to economic alternatives.\\" She also suggests influences on Swann that led to the creation of the community land trust, such as \\"research in Israel on the Jewish National Fund's land trust, certainly Henry George's thinking about the evil consequences of land speculation, and Vinoba Bhave's Bhoodan or land-gift movement; and J. P. Narayan's Gramdan gift movement in India.\\" See also: New Communities and Community Land Trust  Birth of the E. F. Schumacher Society  In the late 1960s, Ralph Borsodi and Swann established the International Independence Institute, which became the Institute for Community Economics (ICE) in the 1970s. Swann discovered the ideas of E.F. Schumacher and became the champion of Schumacher's 1974 U.S. book tour for Small Is Beautiful. In 1980 Swann and Susan Witt, a staff member at ICE and Swann's partner, were asked to move from their offices in Cambridge and establish a regional community land trust in the Berkshires. With interested members of the Berkshire region they incorporated the Community Land Trust in the Southern Berkshires. At the same time in 1980, Swann and Witt were asked by The Schumacher Society in the UK to start an American counterpart. The programs of the E. F. Schumacher Society continue at the Schumacher Center for New Economics.

Since 1998 the magazine has also published L√ºrzer's Archive Specials; volumes on photography, Illustration, packaging, product/music design and other creative fields. In 2011 they began to publish the 200 Best series, along with apps for iPhone and iPad. The magazine was founded by Walter L√ºrzer, a cofounder of advertising agencies Ogilvy & Mather, TBWA Frankfurt and L√ºrzer, Conrad, Publicis, MullenLowe, Havas, McCann and Saatchi & Saatchi which in 1980 merged with Leo Burnett. At first based in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2002 the magazine‚Äôs head office relocated to Salzburg, Austria and then to Vienna, Austria, in 2008. Michael Weinzettl, who was appointed editor-in-chief in the 1980s, became publisher after L√ºrzer's death in April 2011. In 1997 a Chinese version began to be published and in 2004 African distribution commenced in Nigeria and was later extended to cover the whole of Africa. In 2005 expansion into Eastern Europe began in Romania. In 2005 the first annual L√ºrzer¬¥s Archive students contest was staged for the first time and from February 2011 it began to feature digital campaigns.

It was closed in 1960 and is now in agricultural use. History Originally constructed in 1929 between Knokke and the Zwin natural reserve. Initially serving civilian aviation, both by private pilots and airlines such as Sabena, it became a Belgian Air Force field by the late 1930s. At the outbreak of the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, it was home to 6e Escadrille (Squadron) of 3rd Group flying Fairey Foxes tasked with firing exercises over the North Sea. The squadron was evacuated prior to the airfield being attacked by the German Luftwaffe on 10 May. The Belgian Air Force ordered the field destroyed before it was seized by the German Army on 18 May. During the German occupation of Belgium it was used for the training of Anti-Aircraft FLAK units and aircraft hangars were constructed, however it was not used as a Luftwaffe airfield. It was attacked by the Royal Air Force in 1942, and in 1944 the airfield was ordered destroyed by the Germans. Trenches were dug to destroy the runways and the area was mined. The area was liberated by Canadian Army forces in October 1944 and aviation engineers de- mined and constructed twin temporary runways on the airfield. It was designated Advanced Landing Ground B-83; it is not known which Allied units were stationed at the airfield. After May 1945, it was abandoned by the military and turned over to the Belgian Government. It reverted to civilian use until 1960 when the facility was closed. The former airfield/airport has been dismantled and is now used for agriculture. References * Knokke-'t Zwin Airfield * Johnson, David C.

The suggestion worked and Arden's Garden was born. Commercial battle with Coca-Cola In 2003, Arden's Garden's largest customer, the national chain Publix, removed the juice from its shelves in favor of Odwalla, a national brand owned by industry giant Coca-Cola. Leslie Zinn shot off an email to her close friends which snowballed into a 3,000-strong letter-writing campaign to demand that Publix reinstate Arden's Garden as its juice supplier.

Noesis Solutions takes part in key research projects, such as MEGaFIT (zero-defect manufacturing of complex high-precision metal parts), JTI CleanSky Green Rotorcraft and iProd (Integrated management of product heterogeneous data). Optimus allows the integration of multiple engineering software tools (CAD, Multibody dynamics, finite elements, computational fluid dynamics, ...) into a single and automated workflow. Once a simulation process is captured in a workflow, Optimus will direct the simulations to explore the design space and to optimize product designs for improved functional performance and lower cost, while also minimizing the time required for the overall design process. Process integration The Optimus GUI enables the creation of a graphical simulation workflow. A set of functions supports the integration of both commercial and in-house software. A simple workflow can cover a single simulation program, whereas more advanced workflows can include multiple simulation programs. These workflows may contain multiple branches, each with one or more simulation programs, and may include special statements that define looping and conditional branching. Optimus‚Äô workflow execution mechanism can range from a step-by-step review of the simulation process up to deployment on a large (and non-heterogeneous) computation cluster. Optimus is integrated with several resource management systems to support parallel execution on a computational cluster. Design optimization Optimus includes a wide range of methods and models to help solve design optimization problems: * Design of Experiments (DOE) * Response Surface Modeling (RSM) * Numerical optimization, based on local or global algorithms, both for single or multiple objectives with continuous and/or discrete design variables =Design of Experiments (DOE)= : Design of Experiments (DOE) defines an optimal set of experiments in the design space in order to obtain the most relevant and accurate design information at minimal cost. Optimus supports the following DOE methods: : * Full Factorial (2-level & 3-level) : * Adjustable Full Factorial : * Fractional Factorial : * Plackett-Burman : * Central composite : * Random : * Latin-Hypercube : * Starpoints : * Diagonal : * Minimax & Maximin : * Optimal design (I-, D- & A-optimal) : * User-defined =Response Surface Modeling (RSM)= Response Surface Modeling (RSM) is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques that are useful to model and analyze problems in which a design response of interest is influenced by several design parameters. DOE methods in combination with RSM can predict design response values for combinations of input design parameters that were not previously calculated, with very little simulation effort. RSM thus allows further post-processing of DOE results. Optimus‚Äô Response Surface Modeling range from classical Least Squares methods to advanced Stochastic Interpolation methods, including Kriging, Neural Network, Radial Basis Functions and Gaussian Process models. To maximize RSM accuracy, Optimus can also generate the best RSM automatically ‚Äì drawing from a large set of RSM algorithms and optimizing the RSM using a cross-validation approach. =Numerical Optimization= Optimus supports a range of single- objective and multi-objective methods. Multi-objective methods include NLPQL (gradient-based optimization algorithm) and NSEA+ (Non-dominant Sorting Evolution Algorithm). Multi-objective optimization methods usually generate a so-called ‚ÄûPareto front‚Äú or use a weighting function to generate a single Pareto point. Based on the search methods, Optimus optimization methods can be categorized into: * local optimization methods - searching for an optimum based on local information of the optimization problem (such as gradient information). Methods include : * SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming) : * NLPQL : * Generalized Reduced Gradient * global optimization methods - searching for the optimum based on global information of the optimization problem. These are usually probability-based searching methods. Methods include : * Genetic algorithms (Differential Evolution, Self-adaptive Evolution, ...) : * Simulated Annealing * hybrid optimization methods, e.g. Efficient Global Optimization, combining the local and the global approach into one approach which usually relies on response surface modeling to find a global optimum. Robust design optimization In order to assess the influence of real-world uncertainties and tolerances on a given design, Optimus contains Monte Carlo Simulation as well as a First-Order Second Moment method to estimate and improve the robustness of a design. Optimus calculates and optimizes the probability of failure using advanced reliability methods, including First-Order and Second-Order Reliability Methods. Optimus also includes a dedicated set of functionalities to set up a Taguchi study through the definition of control factors, noise factors and signal factors in case of a dynamic study. Genichi Taguchi, a Japanese engineer, published his first book on experimental design in 1958. The aim of the Taguchi design is to make a product or process more stable in the face of variations over which there is little or no control (for example, ensuring reliable performance of a car engine for different ambient temperatures). Applications The use of Optimus covers a wide range of applications, including * optimization of the production process of a center wing box (CWB) factory in function of production rate variations * identification of the best possible design trade- off between ease of swallowing and durability, based on finite element based analysis of food supplement tablet hardness and punch strength simulations * engineering of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) prototype for fuel economy References External links * Noesis Solutions website * Optimus integration with engineering software * Optimus integration with resource management systems * Optimus industry applications Category:Computer system optimization software Category:Computer-aided engineering software Category:Computer-aided design software Category:Mathematical optimization software Category:Simulation software ","title":"Optimus platform"},{"id":"35473002","text":"In the Time of Gods is the eighth studio album by Dar Williams.

It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Working titles of the film were Rich Widow and Old Hannibal. According to Motion Picture Herald, the principal character of Hannah Bell (played by May Robson) was modeled after Hetty Green, famous as the miserly \\"Witch of Wall Street.\\" Plot In 1893 New York, Mrs. Hannah Bell (May Robson) takes her son Donny to a charitable medical clinic, where she gives a false name and information in order to avoid paying (Hetty Green notoriously tried to do the same thing for her son Edward). However, her friend Kate Farley (Mary Forbes) visits the clinic (which she generously supports) and recognizes Donny. She makes Hannah pay for the boy's treatment. Later, Hannah reads in the newspaper that John Burton (Lewis Stone) has been named vice president of the Knickerbocker Bank. Furious, she goes to see her longtime friend and banker Asa Cabot to withdraw all of her money immediately. He is unable to find out why she hates Burton, but refuses to accept his offered resignation. It is later revealed that Burton abandoned Hannah without explanation just before their wedding. She later married a man she did not love who she knew was only after her wealth, just to salvage her pride. Her husband squandered her money, leaving her in desperate financial straits. She painstakingly made herself rich, all for her son's sake, and became a miser just like her father. In 1904, Donny is the valedictorian of his graduating class at Princeton University. He wants to become a writer, but Hannah insists he work at the bank where she has entrusted her now immense wealth. In 1907, Kate learns something about Hannah's relationship to John Burton, and tries to secretly arrange a meeting between them. It does not work, but does unintentionally bring together Donny (played by William Bakewell as a man) and Burton's daughter Elizabeth (Jean Parker). They fall in love. However, Elizabeth at first refuses to marry Donny because she feels that he cannot stand up to his domineering mother. When Hannah finds out about the relationship, she storms into Burton's office and accuses him of trying to get her money through his daughter. He denies plotting against her, but refuses to interfere with the couple. Donny and Elizabeth get married without her approval. She does not even attend the wedding (though she watches from in hiding as the happy newlyweds leave the church). When the Panic of 1907 threatens the banking system of the United States, a committee appeals to Hannah for a desperately needed loan. She is uninterested, until they show her a list of gilt-edged stocks they are offering as security; she spots Burton's own railroad shares and provides the money as a demand loan (on which she can demand repayment at any time). Just after Burton receives his share of the loan to satisfy his bank clients, Hannah notifies him that she wants the loan paid back. Instead of returning the money, he decides to forfeit his stock rather than abandon his depositors. Hannah is delighted to finally avenge herself on her former fiance, having wrested control of the railroad away from him. Donny, just returned from his honeymoon in Europe, gets Burton's side of the story. Then he denounces his mother, accusing her of never loving him, but rather treating him as just another of her possessions. He informs her that Burton left her at the altar because her father tried to get him to sign an agreement never to touch her money. Burton assumed she knew and approved of the stipulation, whereas she never did until now. Stunned by the revelation, she goes outside to the park to think. She catches pneumonia, but recovers. Donny comes to see her, and they are reconciled. She also embraces her daughter-in-law. When Burton shows up (having received the railroad stocks back), that vendetta is also ended.

Life Born on 8 January 1798, he was the eldest son of Robert Gostling White (died 18 October 1828), a solicitor at Halesworth in Suffolk, by his second wife, Elizabeth Meadows (died 25 September 1831); the solicitor John Meadows White was his younger brother. In 1813 Robert was sent to school under John Valpy at Norwich, where John Lindley the botanist, and \\"Rajah\\" James Brooke, were his fellow pupils. On 26 July 1815 he matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in the same year was elected a demy, graduating B.A. on 14 December 1819, M.A. on 28 February 1822, B.D. on 21 November 1833, and D.D. on 23 November 1843. He was ordained deacon in 1821 and priest in 1822. In 1824 he was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, retaining his fellowship till 1847. From 1832 till 1840 he acted as a college tutor. On 15 March 1831 he became proctor, and on 23 April 1834 he was chosen Rawlinson professor of Anglo-Saxon, holding that post for the statutable period of five years. In 1839, at the end of his term of office, White was presented to the vicarage of Woolley, West Yorkshire, near Wakefield, by Godfrey Wentworth of that parish, to whose son William he had acted as tutor. After Wentworth's death he left Woolley, and went to Charles Anderson-Pelham, 2nd Earl of Yarborough at Brocklesby Park in Lincolnshire, where he acted as tutor to the baron's grandsons. In 1842 he was presented to the rectory of Little and Great Glemham in Suffolk by the Hon. Mrs. North, Lord Yarborough's sister, and on 29 October 1846 he was presented by Magdalen College to the rectory of Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, which he retained until his death. White died unmarried at Cheltenham on 31 January 1865, and was buried at Slimbridge, in the churchyard, near the chancel south wall. Works White had contemplated the publication of a Saxon and English vocabulary, and only abandoned the project because it appeared likely to clash with the Anglo-Saxon Dictionary then being prepared by Joseph Bosworth. About 1832 he started editing the Ormulum, a harmonised gospel narrative in verse, preserved in a unique manuscript in the Bodleian Library. The task took nearly twenty years. White visited Denmark in 1837, and travelled to Moscow, where he was arrested and suffered a short detention for visiting the Kremlin without an official order. His edition of the Ormulum was issued in 1852 from the university press, and in the following year an elaborate criticism of it was published in English by C. H. Monicke, a German professor.

Around 1834, the vicars apostolic of Scotland sent the seventy-eight year old McPherson to Rome to deliver a report on the state of religion in Scotland. The bishops stated that due to poverty, most of the priests did not have their own house, but were obliged to live in the cabin of a parishioner.

The historic district includes 347 contributing properties that date from 1891-1950. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. History The area was platted in 1888 and building construction began in 1891. It became a streetcar suburb along Washington's original city limits. The first streetcar was a horse-drawn line that terminated at Connecticut and Florida Avenues. The area's growth intensified when electric streetcars were built on 18th Street in 1892 and Columbia Road in 1896. Washington Heights was primarily a white middle-class neighborhood until the early 1920s when immigrants from Europe and Asia began to move into the neighborhood. Many of the newcomers operated small businesses along 18th Street or worked in the embassies in the area. The African American population was originally limited to the servants and janitors who lived where they were employed. They started moving into their own residences in the area in the 1930s, especially along Vernon Street. Single family row houses were transformed into rooming houses. Racial attitudes regarding the changing demographics led to white flight for the suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s, which also depressed property values. At that time Spanish speaking residents began to move into the area because of its affordable housing and because of its proximity to the Latin American embassies. As turmoil gripped the Latin American countries in the 1960s their numbers began to swell in the neighborhood. The 1970s saw people from the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and Africa move into the neighborhood, which has made the neighborhood a multicultural and multinational mix of people. Architecture The architecture of the historic district is made up of late 19th century row houses that line the grid pattern streets and early 20th century apartment blocks that front the avenues. A variety of commercial structures are found along 18th Street NW.

It also provides standardised systems for assessment and result processing services to organisations. History After nationalisation of banks in India in 1969, Indian banks needed to expand their branch network across the country so that they were more accessible to their customers. This required more staff but recruitment through methods such as advertising were unsatisfactory. Thus, the banks asked the National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM) to design a selection testing process through which they could hire proficient candidates. And as a result, a small unit named Personnel Selection Services (PSS) was established to handle these types of projects. A few years later, in 1984, PSS was converted into IBPS.History of IBPS IBPS currently functions as an autonomous body that is mainly engaged in conducting competitive exams for recruitment to clerical and officers' posts in the banking sector. Earlier, candidates had to write multiple exams conducted by each bank for their vacancies. But from 2012, the Recruitment process has been changed. Now IBPS conducts four different recruitment processes namely CRP PO/MT, CRP RRBs, CRP Clerical, CRP Specialist Officers under which various exams take place every year for banking sector recruitment. The exams conducted by IBPS are as follows: *IBPS PO/MT exam takes place for the recruitment of Probationary Officers and Management Trainees' in the participating banks, which are national public sector banks. *IBPS SO exam takes place for the recruitment of Specialist Officers, which are Scale-I officers in the national public sector banks. *IBPS Clerk exam takes place for the recruitment of Specialist Officers, which are Scale-I officers in the national public sector banks. *IBPS RRB Officer Scale-I exam takes place for the recruitment of Scale-I Officers in Regional Rural Banks, this post is equivalent to Probationary Officers post in National Public Sector Banks. *IBPS RRB Office Assistant exam takes place for the recruitment of Office Assistant in Regional Rural Banks, this post is equivalent to Clerk post in National Public Sector Banks. *IBPS RRB Officer Scale-II and Scale-III exam takes place for the recruitment of Scale-II and Scale-III Officers in Regional Rural Banks, the post of Officer Scale-II is equivalent to Specialist Officer post and Officer Scale-III post is equivalent to Senior Manager in National Public Sector Banks. Governance IBPS is governed by a board that includes nominees from government organisations such as the Reserve Bank of India, Ministry of Finance Government of India, Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai, Indian Institute of Banking and Finance, National Institute of Bank Management, Indian Banks' Association and the public sector banks.

The term is generally used to denote the utilization of extreme weight control methods to compensate for planned binge drinking. Research on the combination of an eating disorder and binge drinking has primarily focused on college-aged women, though the phenomenon has also been noted among young men. Studies suggest that individuals engage in this combination of self-imposed malnutrition and binge drinking to avoid weight gain from alcohol, to save money from purchasing alcohol, and to facilitate alcohol intoxication.{{cite webtitle='Drunkorexia:' A Recipe for Disasterpublisher=ScienceDailydate=October 17, 2011}, https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111017171506.htm Link between binge drinking and eating disorders Studies reveal that individuals experiencing an eating disorder are at a higher risk of developing substance abuse problems.Eating Disorders (2014). Eating disorders, drug, and alcohol addiction. Eating Disorders. Retrieved from http://www.eatingdisorders.org.au/eating-disorders/eating-disorders-a-other- health-problems/eating-disorders-drug-a-alcohol-addiction It is reported that up to half of individuals with eating disorders abuse alcohol or illicit drugs, with anorexia and bulimia being the disorders most commonly linked to substance abuse. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders reports that 72% of women who admit to alcohol abuse also classify as suffering from an eating disorder.  Symptoms  Drunkorexia consists of three major aspects: alcohol use/abuse, food intake restriction, and excessive physical activity. It is commonly summarized in the following activities: * Counting daily calorie intake (commonly known as \\"calorie counting\\") to ensure no weight is gained when consuming alcohol. * Missing or skipping meals to conserve calories to consume alcoholic beverages. * Over-exercising to compensate calories consumed from alcoholic beverages. * Consuming an extreme amount of alcohol to vomit previously ingested food. Treatment Drunkorexia is not a medically diagnosed disorder; therefore, there is no specific treatment. However, as drunkorexia is a combination of two different disorders, binge drinking and eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, the treatment needs to address both.Recovery Connections (2014). Drunkorexia. Retrieved from http://www.recoveryconnection.org/drunkorexia/  Effects  The combination of self-starvation and alcohol abuse can lead to an array of physical and psychological consequences. Drinking in a state of malnutrition can predispose individuals to a higher rate of blackouts, alcohol poisoning, alcohol-related injury, violence, or illness. Drinking on an empty stomach allows ethanol to reach the blood system faster and raises one's blood alcohol content at a dangerous speed, which can render the drinker more vulnerable to alcohol-related brain damage. In addition, alcohol abuse can have a detrimental impact on hydration and mineral and nutrient retention, which exacerbates the consequences of malnutrition and compromises an individual's cognitive faculties.. These effects are more pronounced in women, as women usually metabolize alcohol slower than men.. At risk populations Drunkorexia is found to be most common among university students, as they are faced with the conflicting pressure of heavy drinking and maintaining a slim physique. First-year college students are said to be especially predisposed to eating disorders as an attempt to avoid the fabled \\"Freshman 15\\", defined as the weight gain that results from adjusting to a college lifestyle. . The National Eating Disorder Association disclosed that approximately 20% of college students of both sexes admitted to suffering from an eating disorder at some point in their life. In addition, a 2002 study reported 70%, of participating college students, reported consumed alcohol within the prior month and 40% had engaged in binge drinking. A 2013 survey observed 107 female university students in order to study the frequency and correlation of self- induced vomiting after consuming alcohol. Results showed that 59.8% of the participants who reported drinking alcohol also appeared to have engaged in self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption. Participants that reported self-induced vomiting after alcohol consumption also reported more bulimia nervosa symptomatology.Blackmore, N. P. I., & Gleaves, D. H. (2013). Self- induced vomiting after drinking alcohol. International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 11(4), 453-457. doi:10.1007/s11469-013-9430-9 In Australia, a 2013 study surveyed 139 Australian women between the ages of 18 and 29 enrolled in an undergraduate degree at university. These women were asked to complete a survey regarding compensatory eating and behaviors in response to alcohol consumption to test for drunkorexia symptomatology. In the sample tested, 79% of participants demonstrated engaging in characterized drunkorexia behavior. Further analysis of the results showed that the social norms of drinking and the social norms associated with body image and thinness impacted heavily upon the motivation for these behaviors. Other research has shown that a further correlation exists between college students who participate in physical activity and alcohol dependence. Individuals who were more physically active than their peers had a higher tendency to be alcohol dependent or to engage in regular binge drinking. Excessive exercise is often perceived as a symptom of anorexia nervosa and other associated eating disorders, which further exemplifies the existence of drunkorexia, particularly in college-age individuals.  Motivations  The motivations behind drunkorexia as a pattern of behavior is one of the lesser understood aspects of the condition. It is suspected that the predominant factors in the development of drunkorexia are a distorted self-perception congruent with unrealistic standards of body image, peer pressure to assimilate to the norm in terms of social drinking and societal standards of beauty, a coping mechanism against anxiety and depression, and as a means of getting intoxicated rapidly in response to stress and or peer pressure. Other motivations for drunkorexia include; preventing weight gain, saving money that would be spent on food to buy alcohol, and getting intoxicated faster.University of Missouri (2011).

History left The American battleship Maine exploded in the Havana harbor on February 15, 1898, killing two officers and 250 sailors. Fourteen of the men eventually died, bringing the death toll to a total 266. A board of inquiry concluded that the explosion was caused by a mine placed outside the ship, and the release of the board‚Äôs report led many to accuse Spain of sabotaging the ship, this helped to build public support for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Later studies published in 1976, reissued in 1995, concluded that the ship was destroyed from the inside. Built in honor of the American sailors who died in the explosion of which served as the pretext for the United States to declare war on Spain. The ship had anchored in Havana harbour for three weeks previously at the request of American Consul Fitzhugh Lee. = USS Maine, general characteristics = The Maine was long overall, with a beam of , a maximum draft of and a displacement of . She was divided into 214 watertight compartments. A centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separated the engines and a double bottom covered the hull only from the foremast to the aft end of the armored citadel, a distance of . She had a metacentric height of as designed and was fitted with a ram bow. Deck plan of Maine Maines hull was long and narrow, more like a cruiser than that of Texas, which was wide-beamed. Normally, this would have made Maine the faster ship of the two. Maines weight distribution was ill- balanced, which slowed her considerably. Her main turrets, awkwardly situated on a cut-away gundeck, were nearly awash in bad weather. Because they were mounted toward the ends of the ship, away from its center of gravity, Maine was also prone to greater motion in heavy seas. While she and Texas were both considered seaworthy, the latter's high hull and guns mounted on her main deck made her the drier ship. The two main gun turrets were sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow both to fire fore and aft. The practice of en echelon mounting had begun with Italian battleships designed in the 1870s by Benedetto Brin and followed by the British Navy with , which was laid down in 1874 but not commissioned until October 1881. This gun arrangement met the design demand for heavy end-on fire in a ship-to-ship encounter, tactics which involved ramming the enemy vessel. The wisdom of this tactic was purely theoretical at the time it was implemented. A drawback of an en echelon layout limited the ability for a ship to fire broadside, a key factor when employed in a line of battle. To allow for at least partial broadside fire, Maines superstructure was separated into three structures. This technically allowed both turrets to fire across the ship's deck (cross- deck fire), between the sections. This ability was limited as the superstructure restricted each turret's arc of fire. This plan and profile view show Maine with eight six-pounder guns (one is not seen on the port part of the bridge but that is due to the bridge being cut away in the drawing). Another early published plan shows the same. In both cases the photographs show a single extreme bow mounted six-pounder. Careful examination of Maine photographs confirms that she did not carry that gun. Maines armament set up in the bow was not identical to the stern which had a single six-pounder mounted at extreme aft of the vessel. Maine carried two six-pounders forward, two on the bridge and three on the stern section, all one level above the abbreviated gun deck that permitted the ten-inch guns to fire across the deck. The six-pounders located in the bow were positioned more forward than the pair mounted aft which necessitated the far aft single six-pounder. = Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War = Maines destruction did not result in an immediate declaration of war with Spain, but the event created an atmosphere that precluded a peaceful solution. The Spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers, but the Sampson Board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo. The episode focused national attention on the crisis in Cuba. The McKinley administration did not cite the explosion as a casus belli, but others were already inclined to go to war with Spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in Cuba.Advocates of war used the rallying cry, \\"Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!\\" The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began on April 21, 1898, two months after the sinking. =American interest in the Caribbean= In 1823, the fifth American President James Monroe (1758‚Äì1831, served 1817‚Äì1825) enunciated the Monroe Doctrine, which stated that the United States would not tolerate further efforts by European governments to retake or expand their colonial holdings in the Americas or to interfere with the newly independent states in the hemisphere; at the same time, the doctrine stated that the U.S. would respect the status of the existing European colonies. Before the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), Southern interests attempted to have the United States purchase Cuba and convert it into a new slave territory. The pro-slavery element proposed the Ostend Manifesto proposal of 1854. It was rejected by anti-slavery forces. After the American Civil War and Cuba's Ten Years' War, U.S. businessmen began monopolizing the devalued sugar markets in Cuba. In 1894, 90% of Cuba's total exports went to the United States, which also provided 40% of Cuba's imports.P√©rez, Louis A., Jr, Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. p. 149 Cuba's total exports to the U.S. were almost twelve times larger than the export to her mother country, Spain.P√©rez, Louis A., Jr, Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. p. 138 U.S. business interests indicated that while Spain still held political authority over Cuba, economic authority in Cuba, acting-authority, was shifting to the US. The U.S. became interested in a trans-isthmus canal either in Nicaragua, or in Panama, where the Panama Canal would later be built (1903‚Äì1914), and realized the need for naval protection. Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was an especially influential theorist; his ideas were much admired by future 26th President Theodore Roosevelt, as the U.S. rapidly built a powerful naval fleet of steel warships in the 1880s and 1890s. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897‚Äì1898 and was an aggressive supporter of an American war with Spain over Cuban interests. Meanwhile, the \\"Cuba Libre\\" movement, led by Cuban intellectual Jos√© Mart√≠ until his death in 1895, had established offices in Florida.Gary R. Mormino, \\"Cuba Libre, Florida, and the Spanish American War\\", Theodore Roosevelt Association Journal (2010) Vol. 31 Issue 1/2, pp. 43‚Äì54 The face of the Cuban revolution in the U.S. was the Cuban \\"Junta\\", under the leadership of Tom√°s Estrada Palma, who in 1902 became Cuba's first president. The Junta dealt with leading newspapers and Washington officials and held fund-raising events across the US. It funded and smuggled weapons. It mounted a large propaganda campaign that generated enormous popular support in the U.S. in favor of the Cubans. Protestant churches and most Democrats were supportive, but business interests called on Washington to negotiate a settlement and avoid war. Cuba attracted enormous American attention, but almost no discussion involved the other Spanish colonies of the Philippines, Guam, or Puerto Rico.George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: US Foreign Relations Since 1776 (2008) Historians note that there was no popular demand in the United States for an overseas colonial empire. =USS Maine dispatch to Havana and loss= USS Maine (ACR-1) stern view. Published by Detroit Publishing Company, between 1896-1912. Courtesy of the Library of Congress. (2016/03/31). McKinley sent USS Maine to Havana to ensure the safety of American citizens and interests, and to underscore the urgent need for reform. Naval forces were moved in position to attack simultaneously on several fronts if the war was not avoided. As Maine left Florida, a large part of the North Atlantic Squadron was moved to Key West and the Gulf of Mexico. Others were also moved just off the shore of Lisbon, and still others were moved to Hong Kong.. At 9:40 on the evening of February 15, 1898, Maine sank in Havana Harbor after suffering a massive explosion. While McKinley urged patience and did not declare that Spain had caused the explosion, the deaths of 250 out of 355 sailors on board focused American attention. McKinley asked Congress to appropriate $50 million for defense, and Congress unanimously obliged. Most American leaders took the position that the cause of the explosion was unknown, but public attention was now riveted on the situation and Spain could not find a diplomatic solution to avoid war. Spain appealed to the European powers, most of whom advised it to accept U.S. conditions for Cuba in order to avoid war. Germany urged a united European stand against the United States but took no action. The U.S. Navy's investigation, made public on March 28, concluded that the ship's powder magazines were ignited when an external explosion was set off under the ship's hull. This report poured fuel on popular indignation in the US, making the war inevitable.. For a minority view that downplays the role of public opinion and asserts that McKinley feared the Cubans would win their insurgency before the US could intervene, see Louis A. P√©rez, \\"The Meaning of the Maine: Causation and the Historiography of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War\\", The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 58, No. 3 (August 1989), pp. 293‚Äì322. Spain's investigation came to the opposite conclusion: the explosion originated within the ship. Other investigations in later years came to various contradictory conclusions, but had no bearing on the coming of the war. In 1974, Admiral Hyman George Rickover had his staff look at the documents and decided there was an internal explosion. A study commissioned by National Geographic magazine in 1999, using AME computer modelling, stated that the explosion could have been caused by a mine, but no definitive evidence was found.For a summary of all the studies see Louis Fisher, \\"Destruction of the Maine (1898)\\" (2009)  Sinking  Morro Castle fortress. Wreckage of USS Maine, 1898 Charles Sigsbee, Captain, USS Maine of the sinking of his ship Cover of Collier's Weekly for March 19, 1898: \\"Memorial Service at Grave of Maine's Dead, Havana, March 4\\" American cartoon, published in 1898: \\"Remember the Maine! And Don't Forget the Starving Cubans!\\" In January 1898, Maine was sent from Key West, Florida, to Havana, Cuba, to protect U.S. interests during the Cuban War of Independence. Three weeks later, at 21:40, on 15 February, an explosion on board Maine occurred in the Havana Harbor (). Later investigations revealed that more than of powder charges for the vessel's six- and ten-inch guns had detonated, obliterating the forward third of the ship. The remaining wreckage rapidly settled to the bottom of the harbor. Most of Maines crew were sleeping or resting in the enlisted quarters, in the forward part of the ship, when the explosion occurred. In total, 260 men lost their lives as a result of the explosion or shortly thereafter, and six more died later from injuries. Captain Sigsbee and most of the officers survived, because their quarters were in the aft portion of the ship. Altogether there were 89 survivors, 18 of whom were officers. The cause of the accident was immediately debated. Waking up President McKinley to break the news, Commander Francis W. Dickins referred to it as an \\"accident.\\" Commodore George Dewey, Commander of the Asiatic Squadron, \\"feared at first that she had been destroyed by the Spanish, which of course meant war, and I was getting ready for it when a later dispatch said it was an accident.\\" Navy Captain Philip R. Alger, an expert on ordnance and explosives, posted a bulletin at the Navy Department the next day saying that the explosion had been caused by a spontaneous fire in the coal bunkers. Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt wrote a letter protesting this statement, which he viewed as premature. Roosevelt argued that Alger should not have commented on an ongoing investigation, saying, \\"Mr. Alger cannot possibly know anything about the accident. All the best men in the Department agree that, whether probable or not, it certainly is possible that the ship was blown up by a mine.\\" = Yellow journalism = The New York Journal and New York World, owned respectively by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, gave Maine intense press coverage, employing tactics that would later be labeled \\"yellow journalism.\\" Both papers exaggerated and distorted any information they could obtain, sometimes even fabricating news when none that fitted their agenda was available. For a week following the sinking, the Journal devoted a daily average of eight and a half pages of news, editorials and pictures to the event. Its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to Havana, including Frederic Remington, and Hearst announced a reward of $50,000 \\"for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 American sailors to their deaths.\\". As quoted in . The World, while overall not as lurid or shrill in tone as the Journal, nevertheless indulged in similar theatrics, insisting continually that Maine had been bombed or mined. Privately, Pulitzer believed that \\"nobody outside a lunatic asylum\\" really believed that Spain sanctioned Maines destruction. Nevertheless, this did not stop the World from insisting that the only \\"atonement\\" Spain could offer the U.S. for the loss of ship and life, was the granting of complete Cuban independence. Nor did it stop the paper from accusing Spain of \\"treachery, willingness, or laxness\\" for failing to ensure the safety of Havana Harbor. The American public, already agitated over reported Spanish atrocities in Cuba, was driven to increased hysteria. Monument Fifteen years after the explosion of the USS Maine in 1913, President of the Cuban Republic Mario Garc√≠a Menocal erected a monument on the Malec√≥n in honor of the victims. The architect F√©lix Cabarrocas oversaw the construction which began in 1924 and ended in 1925 under the tenure of President Alfredo Zayas. On the day of its inauguration, 8 March 1925, Cuban and American personalities attended the celebation including President Zayas and American General John Pershing. At the base of the monument were placed two canons and a remaining part of the ship‚Äôs anchor chain that had been salvaged in 1911. In addition, two 40-foot tall Ionic columns were erected; originally the columns did not hold an eagle. Subsequently, they were crowned with a bronze eagle with open wings, created by Cabarrocas. A bronze plaque reads:‚ÄúTo the Victims of the USS Maine. The people of Cuba‚Äù. The eagle with its wings extended vertically in such a way that a hurricane in October 1926 damaged the monument. The original eagle was replaced in 1926 by one with horizontal wings. The first one is now in the U.S. Embassy in Havana. President busts There were originally three busts of Americans: President William McKinley, who declared war on Spain; Leonard Wood, first military governor in Cuba, and President Theodore Roosevelt. On July 4th, 1943, a fourth bust was added--that of Andrew Summers Rowan, the army officer who was said to have carried a message to General Calixto Garcia just prior to the start of the Spanish-American War. Partial destruction The monument today. The monument today. On 18 January 1961, the eagle and busts of the Americans were removed, because it was considered a \\"symbol of imperialism,\\" The following inscription was later added: > To the victims of the Maine who were sacrificed by the imperialist voracity > and their desire to gain control of the island of Cuba > February 1898 ‚Äì February 1961 > (A las v√≠ctimas de El Maine que fueron sacrificadas por la voracidad > imperialista en su af√°n de apoderarse de la isla de Cuba. > Febrero 1898 ‚Äì Febrero 1961) \\"The eagle was torn down after the triumph of the revolution because it's the symbol of imperialism, the United States, and the revolution ended all that,\\" said Ernesto Moreno, a 77-year-old Havana resident who remembers waking up one day and seeing the statue gone. \\"I found it to be a very good thing, and I think most Cubans agreed at the time.\\" Monument restoration The eagle's head was later given to Swiss diplomats. It, too, is now in the building of the Embassy of the United States, Havana. The body and the wings are stored in the Havana City History Museum. The museum's curator believes that good relations with the U.S. will be symbolized by the reunification of the parts of the eagle. Parts of the monument including the original eagle are today being restored  False flag conspiracy theory  The official view in Cuba is that the sinking was a false flag operation conducted by the U.S. Cuban officials argue that the U.S. deliberately sank the ship to create a pretext for military action against Spain. The Maine monument in Havana describes Maines sailors as \\"victims sacrificed to the imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of Cuba\\",Remembering the Maine, CNN, 15 February 1998 which claims that U.S. agents deliberately blew up their own ship.Conner Gorry and David Stanley, \\"Cuba travel guide\\", , 3rd edition, 2004, p. 82 Eliades Acosta was the head of the Cuban Communist Party's Committee on Culture and a former director of the Jos√© Mart√≠ National Library in Havana. He offered the standard Cuban interpretation in an interview to The New York Times, but he adds that \\"Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, and that should be recognized.\\" This claim has also been made in Russia by Mikhail Khazin, a Russian economist who once ran the cultural section at Komsomolskaya Pravda.Mikhail Khazin, \\"In 3 years, most of our oligarchs will go bankrupt\\", an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, 29 October 2008 Operation Northwoods was a series of proposals prepared by Pentagon officials for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962, setting out a number of proposed false flag operations that could be blamed on the Cuban Communists in order to rally support against them. One of these suggested that a U.S. Navy ship be blown up in Guantanamo Bay deliberately. In an echo of the yellow press headlines of the earlier period, it used the phrase \\"A 'Remember the Maine incident\\". Other USS Maine monuments Other monuments to USS Maine are located in the U.S. including: Central Park in New York City; Wood-Ridge, NJ; Key West; Arlington National Cemetery; and Annapolis. (See USS Maine: Memorials) A rudder, gearage, and sections of the exploded hull are located on a traffic island along the Havana; waterfront.

Human rights were invoked and claimed in the contexts of anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, anti- slavery, anti-apartheid, anti-racism, and feminist and indigenous struggles everywhere.\\" A key principle of the human rights movement is its appeal to universality: the idea that all human beings should struggle in solidarity for a common set of basic conditions that has to be followed by all.Clapham, Human Rights (2007), p. 19‚Äì20. \\"...the sense of solidarity amongst those who believe they are the victims of a human rights violation can transcend class, gender, and other distinctions. This sense of connectedness is critical to understanding the changing world of human rights.\\" History Human rights activism predates the 20th century, and includes, for example, the anti- slavery movement.Clapham, Human Rights (2007), p. 27. Historical movements were usually concerned with a limited set of issues, and they were more local than global.

Du Bois, Walter White, and Paul Robeson joined with leaders of the African diaspora (from Haiti, Liberia, the Philippines, and elsewhere) to make a global demand for basic rights.Von Eschen, Race Against Empire (1997), pp. 1‚Äì2.John David Skretny, \\"The effect of the Cold War on African-American civil rights: America and the world audience, 1945‚Äì1968\\", Theory and Society 27(2), 1998. Although the origins of this movement were multifaceted (owing strength both to the capitalist Marcus Garvey and to the more left-wing African Blood Brotherhood), a definitive moment of international solidarity came after Italy's annexation of Ethiopia in 1935.Von Eschen, Race Against Empire (1997), pp. 10‚Äì11. \\"The Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 marked an especially critical moment in the articulation of diaspora thought and politics. Paul Robeson claimed it was a watershed for black American consciousness, since it exposed 'the parallel between [black American] interests and those of oppressed peoples abroad.'\\" =World War II and the United Nations= In the aftermath of World War II, the Pan-Africanist contingent played a major role in causing the United Nations to explicitly protect \\"human rights\\" in its founding documents. Du Bois compared colonies across the world to ghettos in the United States and called for a world document affirming the human rights of all people. Representatives of small countries (particularly from Latin America), as well as Du Bois and other activists, were unhappy with the version of human rights envisioned for the UN Charter at Dumbarton Oaks in 1944.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), pp. 117‚Äì118. Du Bois stated at the time that, evidently, \\"the only way to human equality is through the philanthropy of the masters\\".Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), p. 115. However, the US government supported powerful domestic organizations willing to promote its concept of human rights, such as the American Bar Association and the American Jewish Committee. These organizations won public approval of the United Nations and the human rights concept.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), p. 116. The concept of human rights was indeed built into United Nations with institutions such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Active diplomacy by Latin American countries was instrumental to the process of promoting these ideas and drafting the relevant agreements. As a result of this pressure, more human rights language was adopted at the 1945 San Francisco Conference to create the UN Charter.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), p. 118. \\"These proposals were reintroduced in San Francisco during the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Latin America's significant intellectual production supporting human rights is a major reason the region has been called 'the forgotten crucible' of universal human rights. Latin American jurisprudence was particularly well suited to bridging cultural divides in human rights by linking civil and political rights with economic and social rights.\\" Revelations about the Holocaust, followed by the Nuremberg Trials, also had a major influence on the movement, particularly among Jewish and Christian lobbying groups.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), p. 127. Some NGO's represented the UN charter as a victory for the human rights movement, while other activists argued that it paid lipservice to human rights while basically serving the interests of the great powers.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), pp. 136‚Äì138. \\"A few activists, in particular those whose agenda focused on racial equality and decolonization, were dismayed by the results of San Francisco. The NAACP and allied groups, which had invested significant time, resources, and hopes in using the global forum to highlight the evils of entrenched racism inside the United States and internationally, were bitterly disappointed at the outcome. To no avail, they criticized the failure to dent the vastly unequal power relations operating both between states and within their borders. Rayford Logan, civil rights activist and chair of the history department at Howard University, characterized the human rights articles in the Charter as a 'tragic joke'. But these were minority voices. Just as Roosevelt anticipated, the NGO consultants were thrilled with the role they had played in establishing the organization and fanned out across the country to spread the good news.\\" Early in the Cold War, the \\"human rights\\" concept was used to promote the ideological agendas of the superpowers.Langley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), p. xiv. The Soviet Union argued that people in colonized lands around the world had been exploited by Western powers. A large percentage of Soviet propaganda to the Third World centered on charges of racism and human rights violations. The United States countered with its own propaganda, describing its own society as free and the Soviet Union's as unfree. Human rights language became an international standard, which could be used by great powers or by people's movements to make demands. =Global human rights struggles= Poor People's Campaign March at Lafayette Park, 1968 Within the United States, participants in the Civil Rights Movement called for human rights in addition to civil rights. Du Bois, the National Negro Congress (NNC), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), and other activists, soon began charging the U.S. with human rights violations at the U.N. In 1951, Du Bois, William Patterson and the CRC presented a document called \\"We Charge Genocide\\" which accused the US of complicity with ongoing systematic violence against African Americans. An Appeal for Human Rights, published by Atlanta students in 1960, is cited as a key moment in beginning the wave of nonviolent direct actions that swept the American South.Edward A. Hatfield, \\"Atlanta Sit-ins\\", The New Georgia Encyclopedia, 28 May 2008. In 1967, less than a year before he was assassinated, Martin Luther King, Jr. began to argue that the concept of \\"civil rights\\" was laden with isolating, individualistic capitalist values. He said: \\"It is necessary for us to realize that we have moved from the era of civil rights to the era of human rights. When you deal with human rights you are not dealing with something clearly defined in the Constitution. They are rights that are clearly defined by the mandates of a humanitarian concern.\\"Sam Trumbore, \\"From Civil Rights to Human Rights, King‚Äôs Legacy For Us\\", Times Union, 15 January 2012. For King, who began to organize the multi-racial Poor People's Campaign at the end of his life, human rights required economic justice in addition to de jure equality.Tomas F. Jackson, From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., And the Struggle for Economic Justice, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007. After the decolonization of Africa and of Asia, former colonies gained majority status in the UN's Commission on Human Rights, and focused their attention on global white supremacy and economic inequality‚Äîin doing so, choosing to admit other types of human rights abuses. Some of these nations argued that focusing on civil rights, as opposed to human rights, was a privilege available only to the wealthy nations that had benefited from colonialism. Demands for human rights in the Third World increased throughout the 1960s, even as the global superpowers turned their attention elsewhere.Kiyoteru Tsutsui and Christine Min Wotipka, \\"Global Civil Society and the International Human Rights Movement: Citizen Participation in Human Rights International Nongovernmental Organization\\", Social Forces 83(2), 2004; accessed via JStor, DOI: 10.1353/sof.2005.0022. =Changes in the 1970s= Charter 77 Memorial in Prague Since the 1970s the human rights movement has played an increasingly important role on the international scene. Although government support for human rights decreased, international organizations increased in strength and number. Some of the events of the 1970s, which gave global prominence to the human movements issue, included the abuses of Chilean Augusto Pinochet and American Richard Nixon administrations; the signing of the Helsinki Accords (1975) between the West and the USSR; the Soweto riots in South Africa; awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Amnesty International (1977); and the emergence of the Democracy Wall movement in China. Nixon was succeeded by the Jimmy Carter administration, much more supportive of the human rights issues. Even before Carter made human rights central to his foreign policy, progressives in Congress had institutionalized human rights in the State Department and passed legislation tying human rights to foreign aid considerations.Barbara Keys, Reclaiming American Virtue: The Human Rights Revolution of the 1970s (Harvard University Press, 2014). Pressure from the international human rights movement brought human rights increasingly to the political agenda of numerous countries and diplomatic negotiations. As the issue of human rights became important for dissidents in the Eastern Bloc (Soviet human rights movement, Charter 77, Workers' Defence Committee), this period also saw a growing reframing of the struggle between the West and USSR from the economic terms (\\"communism versus free market\\") into a struggle for human rights (\\"totalitarianism versus liberty\\"). Since the end of the Cold War, the issues of human rights have been present in a number of major political and military conflicts, debated by global public opinion, from Kosovo to Iraq, Afghanistan, Congo and Darfur. Originally, most international human rights organizations came from France and the UK; since the 1970s American organizations moved beyond rights for Americans to partake in the international scene, and around the turn of the century, as noted by Neier, \\"the movement became so global in character that it is no longer possible to ascribe leadership to any particular [national or regional] segment\\". However, others, like Ibhawoh, point out that there still is a gap between regions, particularly as most of the international human rights movement organizations are located in the global North, and thus continuous concerns are raised about their understanding of the situations in the global South. =Since the 1990s= Graffiti on a metal plate in Plaza Montenegro, Rosario, Argentina, related to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo movement. The global human rights movement has become more expansive since the 1990s, including greater representation of women's rights and economic justice as part of the human rights umbrella. Economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights gained new prominence.Nelson and Dorsey, New Rights Advocacy (2008), p. 14. \\"Since the mid-1990s the human rights movement has begun to take seriously the economic and social rights guaranteed in the international human rights covenants; development and human rights NGOs have joined in human rights‚Äìdriven social movements for food, health, education, water, and other rights, often challenging development orthodoxy.\\" Advocates for women's human rights (sometimes identifying as part of the feminist movement), criticized the early human rights movement for focusing on male concerns and artificially excluding women's issues from the public sphere. Women's rights have nevertheless gained prominence in the international human rights movement, particularly insofar as they include protection from gender-based violence.Charlotte Bunch, \\"Transforming Human Rights From a Feminist Perspective\\", in Women's Rights, Human Rights, (1995) ed. Stone & Wolper. In Latin America, the issue of women's human rights intersects with the struggle against authoritarian governments. In many cases, fpr example the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, women's groups were some of the most prominent advocates of human rights in general.Elisabeth Friedman, \\"Women's Human Rights: The Emergence of a Movement\\", in Women's Rights, Human Rights, (1995) ed. Stone & Wolper. Mainstream acceptance of women's human rights within the international human rights movement has increased since 1989. The authority of the United Nations human rights framework diminished in the 1990s, partly due to the emphasis on economic liberalization that followed the Cold War.Nelson and Dorsey, New Rights Advocacy (2008), p. 51. \\"The 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna was expected by some to be a celebration of the post‚Äìcold war era, the new freedom of the United Nations to operate in a less politicized international environment, and NGO human rights successes. Instead it marked a watershed moment for the integrity of the human rights system, as NGOs battled a coalition of governments determined to undermine the principle of the universality of human rights standards and weaken the UN human rights system. [...] The challenge to shore up the fundamental concept of universality of rights was compounded by shifts in the foreign policy priorities of Western governments. A new Democratic administration in the United States made promoting free-market democracies, rather than human rights, its top priority, resulting in human rights regressions, including the delinking of trade and aid from human rights guarantees (Mann 1999).\\" The 1990s also saw a call to \\"defend the defenders\\" of human rights‚Äîto protect human rights activists from violence and repression.Nelson and Dorsey, New Rights Advocacy (2008), p. 53. Unfortunately, there has been an increase in the number of attacks on the activists The movement has come to a standstill as individuals continue to push for liberation but are unable to report their findings out of fear of harm or death. The number of female activists has been growing since the beginning of the Feminist movement however, there have been increased number of attacks on women. Recently, the Taliban targeted the female activists to send a message. The internet has expanded the power of the human rights movement by improving communication between activists in different physical locations.Halpin and Hoskins, Human Rights and the Internet (2000), pp. 8‚Äì9. This is known as mediated mobilization. Individuals who are using their voices to communicate about the injustices are now able to communicate with like minded people who use their voices through participatory journalism. The human rights movement has historically focused on abuses by states, and some have argued that it has not attended closely enough to the actions of corporations.Langley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), p. xix. \\"...business corporations (especially transnational ones) are often more powerful than states, and therefore enjoy the capacity to promote or undermine the rights and well-being of individuals and groups. Yet, the human rights movement, as it initially developed, did not seek to make business corporations accountable for human rights abuses, such as child labor, business-supported political repression, environmental degradation, and sexual harassment...\\" In the 1990s, some first steps were taken towards holding corporations accountable for human rights abuses. For example, the Parliament of Britain approved a resolution to censure British Petroleum for funding Colombian death squads.Langley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), pp. 36‚Äì37. Organizations such as Human Rights Watch also began to pressure other nongovernmental organizations to take human rights into account. In 1993, Human Rights Watch successfully lobbied the International Olympic Committee to vote against awarding the 2000 Olympic Games to Beijing because of China's human rights record.Barbara Keys, \\"Harnessing Human Rights to the Olympic Games: Human Rights Watch and the 1993 ‚ÄòStop-Beijing‚Äô Campaign,‚Äù The Journal of Contemporary History 53, no. 2 (2018): 415-38. doi: 10.1177/0022009416667791 Issues and activities United Workers demonstrating for human rights and fair development in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The international human rights movement is concerned with issues such as deprivation of life and liberty, deprivation of the right of free and peaceful expressions, gatherings and worship,Langley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), p. 240. equal treatment regardless of individual background, and opposition to unjust and cruel practices such as torture. Other issues include opposition to the death penaltyLangley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), p. 41, 256. and to child labor.Langley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), p. 47. Much of the human rights movement is local in nature, concerned with human rights violations in their own countries, but they rely on an international network of support. The international nature of the movement allows local activists to broadcast their concerns, sometimes generating international pressure on their home government. The movement generally espouses the principle that sovereignty ends where human rights begin. This principle justifies intervention across borders to rectify perceived violations.Langley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), p. 169. The human rights movement is also credited with supplying local activists with a vocabulary to use in support of their claims.David Kennedy, \\"The International Human Rights Movement: Part of the Problem?\\" 15 Harvard Human Rights Journal 101, 2002. Limitations and criticism One major schism within the international human rights movement has been between NGOs and activists from the First and Third Worlds. Critics of the mainstream movement have argued that it suffers from systemic biases and is unwilling to confront inequality on a global scale.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), p. 324.Langley, Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945 (1999), p. xviii. In particular, some critique the role of neoliberal capitalism in creating economic conditions that engender 'human rights violations', arguing that the dominant human rights movement is blind to these dynamics.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), p. 325‚Äì326. (See also: structural adjustment.) Makau Mutua has written: > As currently constituted and deployed, the human rights movement will > ultimately fail because it is perceived as an alien ideology in non-Western > societies. The movement does not deeply resonate in the cultural fabrics of > non-Western states, except among hypocritical elites steeped in Western > ideas. In order ultimately to prevail, the human rights movement must be > moored in the cultures of all peoples.Makau Mutua, Human Rights: A Political > and Cultural Critique (2002), quoted in Clapham, Human Rights (2007), p. > 161. David Kennedy has criticized a tendency of the international human rights movement to \\"treat human rights as an object of devotion rather than calculation\\", arguing that human rights language is vague and may impede utilitarian assessments of a situation. Kennedy also argues that this vocabulary can be \\"misused, distorted, or co-opted\\", and that framing issues in terms of human rights may narrow the field of possibility and exclude other narratives. Others have also critiqued the movement and its language as vague.Normand and Zaidi, Human Rights at the UN (2008), p. 5. Some have argued that the human rights movement has a tendency to subtly debase people by portraying them as victims of abuse and others again have argued that this very argument is used in order to downplay human rights abuses.Clapham, Human Rights (2007), pp. 160‚Äì161. \\"Some critics argue that human rights organizations may tend to generate a narrative that reinforces images of helpless victims oppressed by an alien culture; in turn, this could be said to continue imperialism by other means.\\" Organizations Particularly since the 1970s, the international human rights movement has been mediated by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Major international human rights organizations include Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Historically, the influence of the International Federation for Human Rights is seen as highly important on the movement. The creation of the International Criminal Court at the turn of the 21st century is seen as another achievement of the international human rights activists.

Whilst not as famous as neighbouring Wheal Vor, it was thus described by the Mining Journal in July 1885: \\" Truly this is a wonderful mine‚Äîprobably the richest tin mine in the world.\\" It also hosts a very remarkable engine house of the mid-19th century that once stood over Trelawney's shaft on Wheal Vor, and since the Wheal Vor area itself has no visible remains, this is the only large surviving engine house of this group of mines which accounted for over a quarter of Cornish tin production in the mid-19th century. Geology Around 290 to 280 million years ago rising plutons of granite intruded the native sedimentary rocks locally known as killas. Several of the domes formed were eventually exposed after their sedimentary coverings were eroded. Wheal Metal lies in the metamorphic area of two of the granitic hills thus exposed, Tregonning Hill and Godolphin Hill in the West of Cornwall. During the cooling periods that ensued, fractures opened in the granite and surrounding killas and provided a path for mineralising solutions to rise, and occupy the voids and enrich the surrounding rocks. Those mineral lodes vary in thickness from a few inches to several feet. Where the lodes outcrop on the surface, mineral-rich rocks were eroded and washed away in the streams, providing the early adventurers their first chance to recover the minerals exposed and locally accumulated in \\"placers\\". This is essentially a tin-producing sett with a limited output of arsenic, but little or no copper was extracted from it. Early history Wheal Metal occupies the side of a valley drained by Sithney waters. Although no documented early history has survived, it is very likely the site was explored early on because of its ideal situation on the flank of the valley. The two known lodes intersect the stream at a 45-degree angle, providing ample opportunity for digging trenches into the sides of the hill. It is equally possible that a water-driven pump may have been in use, as suggested by the presence of a shaft now backfilled on the edge of the stream itself. The former pools upstream of the works, as well as an unnatural kink in the course of the stream and the remain of an old sluice gate, indicates past efforts to harness the power of water. The area is known as Poldown, the element \\"Pol\\" in Cornish names being often associated with pools. 1850 onwards Wheal Metal's 19th-century exploitation is from the beginning linked to that of Wheal Vor's, and that in turn to the price of tin. The price of metallic tin peaked in 1811,A history of tin mining and smelting in Cornwall D.B. Barton page 47 1857 and 1872,A history of tin mining and smelting in Cornwall D.B. Barton page 110 and each of those price peaks can be associated with documented activity at Wheal Metal undertaken for the most part by adventurers already involved with the working of Wheal Vor. In the early 1800s they sank a shaft and put a small engine over it.Exploring Cornish mines volume 4 page 193 During the first part of the 19th century, four main shafts were sunk, Metal shaft, Old (or West) metal shaft, Edwards shaft, and Iveys's shaft. By 1848 at the time of the suspension of work at Wheal Vor one of its engines ( Bounder whim ) was moved to Old Metal shaft which reached depths of between 50 or 70 fathoms below adit, which, however, remains modest compared with the 236 fathoms reached at Wheal Vor, but nonetheless returned some rich parcels of tins. With the price of tin rising, the financial tangle which marked the end of the work at Wheal Vor was unwound, a new company was formed as Great Wheal Vor United A history of tin mining and smelting in Cornwall D.B. Barton page 100 which then acquired the sett of Wheal Metal in 1853 A history of tin mining and smelting in Cornwall D.B. Barton page 103 and continued to work its lodes deeper hitting rich deposits at 80 fathoms, and possibly starting work on a second adjacent lode named Schneider's lode in honour of the chairman of the company. In 1852 flat rods were taken from West Metal to Wheal Metal In 1855 a 26-inch whim was installed. This sett together with nearby Flow (also acquired in 1953) were the only source of income of the company, which was still putting all its resources into dewatering Wheal Vor. By October 1857, Wheal Vor had been dewatered only to find the promised riches were not materialising. Shareholders decided to carry on, however, as the returns of Wheal Metal were encouraging. In 1859 a 60-inch engine was installed to pump at Iveys shaft to allow the mine to reach deeper into the lode. By 1860, however, all hopes of fair returns on the Wheal Vor sett were abandoned and the engines put up for sale. No buyer having been found, it was decided to move the 85-inch pumping engine and steam whim that was over Trelawney's shaft to Iveys' shaft on Wheal Metal, where the 60-inch was still pumping. In order to disrupt the pumping and the extraction of the tin as little as possible, it was decided to build the engine house for the 85-inch at right angle to the 60-inch. The stones of the engine house at Trelawneys Wheal Vor were numbered according to J.Trounson,Author of many articles on Cornish mining gathered in a book titled \\"The Cornish Mineral Industry\\" dismantled and reused to build the engine house at Iveys' shaft. In 1864 the 85 engine was then moved (the operations involved heavy carriages pulled by as many as 40 horsesCornish mining Bryan Earl page 111), erected in position, and inside 4 days the pumping rods were disconnected from the 60-inch engine and reconnected to the 80-inch with remarkably little interruption in pumping.The Cornish beam engine D.B. Barton page 239 By 1865 The Mining Journal was exclaiming \\"Truly this is a wonderful mine ‚Äì probably the richest tin mine in the world\\". In 1868 Ivey's shaft was equipped with a 12-foot-stroke man-engine driven by a 30-inch Bull engine.Exploring Cornish mines K.Brown and B.Acton volume 4 page 193 The sett was returning 60 tons of black tin per month in the mid-1860s, and by 1867 it returned an average of 70/80 tons of black tin per month,J. Trounson The Cornish mineral industry page 96 which represented 10 percent of the entire tin output of Cornwall for that year. Occasionally the mine would turn poor and was nearly abandoned, only to be revived by new discoveries. By 187, however, Ivey's shaft reached its final depth of 227 fathoms, and with falling ore grades and low tin prices, work finally stopped for good in the entire sett in 1874.Exploring Cornish mines volume 4 page 194 In 1877 the company was wound up and the 85-inch engine sold to Newcastle and Gateshead waterworks' Wylam pumping station in Northumberland, where it survived until the 1940s. Wheal Metal today A number of private properties share the original sett connected by a network of paths and lanes. The most visible of the remains is the superb engine house in excellent condition. A cast-iron pipe of fair diameter is visible at the intersection of two lanes a little to the north of the engine house, and points to the direction of where the dressing floor may have been next to a large heap of spoils several storeys high that stood there until sold off to the Navy for the foundations of one of the runways at nearby Culdrose Navy base. The sett is included in an area designated as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of the contribution of Cornish mining to the Industrial Revolution. This has gone hand in hand with a reappraisal of the archaeological importance of the remaining structures and landscapes, and its inclusion in the due processes of planning and development under \\"Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the historic environment\\" (2010). This latest document defines two important new concepts: 'heritage asset' and 'significance'.Cornish Archaeology Golden Jubilee volume, page 87 Wheal Metal must be considered as a significant asset both in terms of landscape and structural remains as it holds the only surviving structure of the Wheal Vor group of mines, which so dominated mid-19th-century tin mining in Cornwall.

It is a perennial herb that can grow to 1.5 meters (5 meet) tall. There is usually a single erect stem which may be brownish to bluish and has rough hairs. The basal rosette of leaves may be up to 30 centimeters (1 foot) wide and may persist until the flowering stage. The leaves are serrated and lined with hairs. The inflorescence contains sometimes as many as 100 flower heads, each head containing 4-8 yellow ray florets surrounding 10-18 disc florets. The fruits are covered in long hairs.Solidago villosicarpa. Flora of North America. This species is native to the coastal plain of North Carolina.Solidago villosicarpa. Center for Plant Conservation. It occurs in a variety of habitat types, but it is always found within 1000 feet (300 meters) of an estuary. It grows in several types of forest habitat and maritime scrub. It grows on the coast or farther inland next to tidal waters. The plant is likely adapted to patterns of disturbance, except for fire. The sites where it is currently found have all been logged at some point. The plants also respond positively to hurricane damage, where surrounding trees are blown down. The species is probably not tolerant of shade and does better when the canopy is opened or removed. Each of the four known populations has between 100 and 1400 individuals. It is considered critically imperiled.

History In 1968, Brathwaite wrote about CAM's origins, dating them back to a small informal meeting held on 19 December 1966 in his London flat in Mecklenburgh Square (although Louis James suggests that the \\"seed ideas of what was to become CAM were germinating in Brathwaite's activities at Mona in the previous decade\\"):James (2003), \\"The Caribbean Artists Movement\\", p. 211. > \\"What was to become the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) started in December > 1966 in my Bloomsbury basement flat.

The BBC programme Caribbean Voices, to which Brathwaite was also a contributor, is considered a precursor of CAM. The journal Savacou was started as a platform for CAM, connecting its activities in Britain, the Caribbean region and the African diaspora, and elsewhere internationally. La Rose began selling and publishing books, under the name New Beacon Books, because of the demand for material that was stimulated by the formation of CAM. Other notable artists and intellectuals associated with CAM include C. L. R. James, Stuart Hall, Wilson Harris, Kenneth Ramchand, Ronald Moody, Aubrey Williams, Gordon Rohlehr, Christopher Laird, Louis James, Clifton Campbell, Orlando Patterson, Ivan Van Sertima, Althea McNish, Donald Hinds, James Berry, Errol Lloyd and Anne Walmsley. Linton Kwesi Johnson is among a younger generation of Caribbean writers to have been inspired by CAM during the early '70s.\\"Linton Kwesi Johnson‚Äôs Dub Poetry and the Political Aesthetics of Carnival in Britain\\".Sandra Courtman, \\"Caribbean Artists' Movement\\", in Alison Donnell (ed.), Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture, Routledge, 2002, p. 64‚Äì65.

Burk (born 1948) is an American sociologist and professor at Texas A&M; University. He is most notable as a scholar of military sociology, political sociology, and the history of sociology. He is a central figure in the study of civil-military relations in democratic societies. Biography Burk was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1948. He enlisted in the Maryland National Guard and served from 1968 to 1974. In 1975, he received his BS degree in sociology, magna cum laude, from Towson University. He then earned his MA in sociology in 1978 and PhD in sociology in 1982 from the University of Chicago. He cites his primary intellectual influences as Edward Shils and Morris Janowitz, founder of sociological studies of the military. Burk taught for two years at McGill University in Montreal and then joined Texas A&M; University in 1983, where he is now a full professor. He received a Distinguished Teaching Award from A&M;‚Äôs College of Liberal Arts in 1990. From 1995 to 1998, he was editor-in-chief of the journal Armed Forces & Society. In 2009, he received the Morris Janowitz Career Achievement Award from the Inter- University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society. One year later, Burk was named a Cornerstone Faculty Fellow in Texas A&M;‚Äôs College of Liberal Arts. He was elected chair and president of the Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces & Society in 2013. In 2014, he received the Robin M. Williams, Jr. Award for Distinguished Contributions to Scholarship, Teaching and Service from the Peace, War, and Social Conflict section of the American Sociological Association.http://www.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/awards.cfm Career Throughout his career, Burk has examined issues related to civil-military relations, military sociology, the history of sociology, and the use and regulation of power in relation to democracy. Burk has made distinctive contributions to the history of sociology, especially in relation to the history of military sociology. He collaborated with David R. Segal on a four-volume anthology of primary source materials, documenting key themes in the development of military sociology from the early nineteenth century to the present.David R. Segal and James Burk, eds. Military Sociology, four volumes (London: Sage Publications, 2012). Burk has written a comprehensive biographical essay of Janowitz. The essay appears as an introduction to Burk's edited collection of Janowitz's papers published in the Heritage of Sociological Series of the University of Chicago Press.Gordon Marshall, ed. A Dictionary of Sociology, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998): 331. Over four decades, Burk has studied issues related to the use and abuse of power in democratic societies. His early work on the evolution of American stock market regulation from 1880 to 1980 demonstrates this theme.James Burk, Values in the Marketplace: The American Stock Market Under Federal Securities Law (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1992). In the field of military sociology, his work shaped debates in the field, challenging the notion prevalent in the 1990s that the American public would not support military missions if they incurred casualties.James Burk, ‚ÄúPublic Support for Peacekeeping in Lebanon and Somalia: Assessing the Casualties Hypothesis,‚Äù Political Science Quarterly 114 (Spring, 1999): 53-78. Burk also engaged in debates about the integration of race and gender minorities in the all-volunteer force, proposing a new approach for identifying institutional discrimination, which previous analyses omitted.James Burk, ‚ÄúMilitary Service and Citizenship Status,‚Äù Armed Forces & Society 21 (Summer, 1995): 503-529.James Burk and Evelyn Espinoza Sandoval, ‚ÄúMilitary Race Relations,‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 38 (2012): 401-422.

The U.S. National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) Digital Manipulation Code of Ethics states: ‚ÄúAs journalists we believe the guiding principle of our profession is accuracy; therefore, we believe it is wrong to alter the content of a photograph in any way that deceives the public. As photojournalists, we have the responsibility to document society and to preserve its images as a matter of historical record. It is clear that the emerging electronic technologies provide new challenges to the integrity of photographic images... in light of this, we the National Press Photographers Association, reaffirm the basis of our ethics: Accurate representation is the benchmark of our profession. We believe photojournalistic guidelines for fair and accurate reporting should be the criteria for judging what may be done electronically to a photograph. Altering the editorial content... is a breach of the ethical standards recognized by the NPPA.‚Äù Popular image manipulations throughout in history =Lincoln 1860= An iconic portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was a composite of Lincoln's head and the Southern politician John Calhoun's body. This is a very good example of a photograph that is very well known by the general public as a real photograph and not an altered one. Frances Griffiths with Fairies =Fairies 1917= This picture shows Frances Griffiths, one of two cousins who featured in the images known as the \\"Cottingley Fairies\\". This photo was part of a series showing fairies made by the cousins. The photos became highly publicized with some people believing they were fake while others believed their authenticity. Later the cousins admitted that the pictures were not manipulated but that they made the fairies out of cardboard and staged them in the scene. Besides this confession the cousins still claimed that they had seen fairies. =Purged 1930= Joseph Stalin often air-brushed his enemies out of photographs. Nikolai Yezhov was removed from the original image after falling out of favor with Stalin and being executed. =Mussolini 1942= Benito Mussolini had a portrait done of himself where he was on a horse, he had the horse handler removed from the original photograph in order to make himself look more heroic. =Oprah 1989= Oprah Winfrey was on the cover of TV Guide in 1989. The picture showed a very slender-looking Winfrey in a dress that was recognized by actress Ann- Margret's fashion designer. It was revealed that the picture was actually a composite of Oprah's head spliced onto the body of Ann-Margret from a 1979 publicity shot. Neither Oprah Winfrey nor Ann-Margret had given permission for the composite to be created. =OJ Simpson 1994= OJ Simpson's June 17, 1994 mugshot was used on the cover of Time and Newsweek magazines. Newsweek used the mugshot unaltered whereas Time released one that made Simpson's face appear darker, blurrier and unshaven. This resulted in many people crying foul at Time for attempting to make Simpson appear guilty when in America a man is considered innocent until proven guilty. =Tourist of Death 1997= This picture was released to email and went viral after New York City was attacked on September 11, 2001. The title of the email was 'the tourist guy', 'the accidental tourist', 'Waldo' or the 'WTC Guy'. It showed a man standing on the observation deck of one of the World Trade Center towers before the plane hit the building. When others started claiming to be the subject of the photo a 25-year-old Hungarian man named P√©ter Guzli came forward and explained that he did not want any publicity. \\"I'd like to keep my identity incognito.... This was a joke meant for my friends, not such a wide audience.\\" Guzli had taken the picture in 1997 when he had visited relatives in New York, after 9/11 he edited the picture to make it look like he had been on the tower when the plane hit. =Diversity 2000= Hoping to illustrate its diverse enrollment, the University of Wisconsin at Madison doctored a photograph on a brochure cover by digitally inserting a black student in a crowd of white football fans. The original photograph of white fans was taken in 1993. The additional black student, senior Diallo Shabazz, was taken in 1994. University officials said that they spent the summer looking for pictures that would show the school‚Äôs diversity but could find none. =Walski forgery 2003= In the early media coverage of the 2003 Iraq War, a minor controversy erupted when it was revealed that Los Angeles Times photographer Brian Walski had taken two images and made a more dramatic composite. ‚ÄúWhen that guy came up with the baby, I shot off ten more frames. I had just one where you could see the soldier's face. The others he was turned away. I put four pictures on my laptop. I was going back and forth. There was no reason to do [what I did]. I was playing around a little bit. I said, 'that looks good.' I worked it and sent it.... I wasn't debating the ethics of it when I was doing it. I was looking for a better image. It was a 14 hour day and I was tired. It was probably ten at night. I was looking to make a picture. Why I chose this course is something I'll go over and over in my head for a long time. I certainly wasn't thinking of the ramifications‚Äù. On April 1, Walski was fired. =Beatles Abbey Road 2003= The original copy of the Beatles' Abbey Road album cover shows Paul McCartney, third in line, holding a cigarette. United States poster companies have airbrushed this image to remove the cigarette from McCartney‚Äôs hand. This change was made without the permission of either McCartney or Apple Records, which owns the rights to the image. =Kerry-Fonda Rally 2004= A manipulated photograph surfaced during the U.S presidential campaign of John Kerry in 2004, causing serious controversy. The picture shows both Kerry and Jane Fonda speaking at an anti-war rally. Kerry's team quickly responded that while he did attend many rallies throughout the 1970s, and he did attend at least one with Jane Fonda (a September 1970 anti-war rally in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania of which there is a picture of Fonda with Kerry in the background), Kerry and Fonda never spoke together at any rallies. =Ralph Lauren 2009= The most notorious example of extreme retouching in fashion advertising was made in a magazine advertisement by Ralph Lauren which depicted a heavily manipulated photo of model Filippa Hamilton. Many complaints were made saying that the image had impossibly inhuman proportions. A Ralph Lauren representative admitted to \\"poor imaging and retouching\\", and added, \\"we have learned that we are responsible for the poor imaging and retouching that resulted in a very distorted image of a woman‚Äôs body. We have addressed the problem and going forward will take every precaution to ensure that the calibre of our artwork represents our brand appropriately.\\" See also * Photomontage References Category:Photographic techniques ","title":"Photographic manipulation"},{"id":"35473357","text":"Secession was an American expatriate little magazine edited by Gorham Munson, Matthew Josephson, and Kenneth Burke. During its two-year, eight issue run, Secession managed to further the careers of writers like Waldo Frank, Slater Brown, Robert Coates, E. E. Cummings, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Hart Crane, and William Carlos Williams, among others. Printed in cities like Vienna, Berlin, Reutte, and Brooklyn, New York, Secession is considered an exile magazine, and has been called the ‚Äúliveliest‚Äù of the little magazines published abroad.Rosenfeld, Alvin H. ‚ÄúJohn Wheelwright, Gorham Munson, and the ‚ÄòWars of Secession‚Äô.‚Äù Michigan Quarterly Review 14 (1975): 13‚Äî40. MLAIB. Web. 4 Feb 2012. In his article ‚ÄúThe Interstice between Scylla and Charybdis,‚Äù Munson distinguished Secession from little magazines like The Little Review and Broom, and stated that the goal for his magazine is to be ‚Äúneither a personal nor an anthological magazine, but to be a group organ. [Secession] will make group-exclusions, found itself on a group basis, point itself in a group-direction, and derive its stability and correctiveness from a group.‚ÄùMunson, Gorham. ‚ÄúThe Interstice between Scylla and Charybdis.‚Äù Secession 2 (1922): 30‚Äî32. Print. The pieces published in this magazine certainly demonstrated creative energy, but the strained relationship between Secession‚Äôs editors also contributed to the magazine's spirited image. History In 1922, Munson, who was greatly influenced by Malcolm Cowley's essay ‚ÄúThis Youngest Generation,‚ÄùCowley, Malcolm. ‚ÄúThis Youngest Generation.‚Äù New York Evening Post Literary Review 2 (15 October 1921): 82. Print. desired to launch a little magazine. It was around this time that Munson met Matthew Josephson and Malcolm Cowley, and together, they formed Secession, a little magazine that would help the Younger Generation of writers ‚Äúsecede‚Äù from the Middle Generation; Munson supplied the funds, Josephson the literary connection, and Cowley the intellectual stimulus.Munson, Gorham. ‚ÄúThe Fledgling Years, 1916‚Äî1924.‚Äù Sewanee Review 40 (1932): 24‚Äî54. Print. Taking advantage of the favorable, post- World War I exchange rate between the American dollar and European currency, Munson printed the first issue of Secession (Spring 1922) in Vienna for under $20.\\\\---. ‚ÄúHow to Run a Little Magazine.‚Äù The Saturday Review of Literature, 27 March 1937. 3‚Äî4. Print. In this issue, Munson stated that ‚Äúbeyond a two-year span, observation shows, the vitality of most reviews is lowered and their contribution, accomplished, becomes repetitious and unnecessary. Secession will take care to avoid morbidity.‚Äù After the magazine's second issue, Munson decided to return to America, and selected Josephson to handle Secession‚Äôs European affairs as his official coeditor, and Kenneth Burke joined the team as the magazine‚Äôs third editor effective its fourth issue ‚Äúin order that any disagreement might be settled by vote.‚Äù The third issue's costs were still low, costing approximately $25 to print. The 32 page Secession, which ‚Äúnever sold over 150 copies (though about 320 were distributed gratis)‚Äù managed to ‚Äústir up controversy,‚Äù and reviews for the magazine appeared in publications like The Dial, The Little Review, The New York Times, and The Criterion. Editorial Feuds Munson's review was successful thus far, but the contents of the fourth issue, edited by Munson, Josephson, and Burke, would act as the instigator of a well-known literary feud. Josephson, perturbed that Burke and Munson outvoted him, took it upon himself to condense one of Richard Ashton's greatest poems, which he objected to publishing, from about one hundred lines down to three. This action deeply angered Munson, and their feud caused Josephson to resign from his post and join the Broom camp. After the fallout, Secession was not published again for several months, but in the meantime, Munson and Burke spread stories to their contemporaries that Josephson ‚Äúwas an intellectual fakir.\\"Hoffman, Fredrick J, Charles A. Allen, and Carolyn F. Urlich. The Little Magazine: A History and a Bibliography. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1946. Print. The magazine's sixth issue also saw editorial squabbling, this time between Munson and John Brooks Wheelwright. Wheelwright oversaw the printing of this issue in Florence, and radically altered Hart Crane's poem ‚ÄúFor the Marriage of Faustus and Helen,‚Äù which greatly angered Munson.Rosenfeld, Alvin H. ‚ÄúJohn Wheelwright, Gorham Munson, and the ‚ÄòWars of Secession‚Äô.‚Äù The poem was reprinted in Secession no. 7, which Munson edited himself, as the version originally written by Crane. The End Munson edited Secession‚Äôs last two issues himself, and in April 1924, the magazine ended in accordance with his prophetic statement in Secession no. 1. Although Secession did not introduce any new writers, it did ‚Äúreinforce and strengthen the rebel fight against the sentimental genteel tradition.\\"Hoffman, Fredrick J, Charles A.

Leiden records also state that on May 19, 1617, he was the groom's witness for the betrothal of Henry Collet to Alice Thomas. Crackston's daughter Anna (Anne) married Thomas Smith in Leiden on December 12, 1618, to which he is also recorded as being a witness.

The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton.

John Crackston was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact. His son John Jr. was apparently not yet twenty-one years of age and did not sign the Compact.  Family of John Crackston  Crackston may have married sometime prior to 1600, probably in England where his wife also may have died, as there is no mention of her in Leiden records. Her name is unknown. Children of John Crackston and _______: * Anna (Anne) Crackston was born about 1600, probably in Colchester, co. Essex, England. She married Thomas Smith, presumed to be English, in Leiden on December 22, 1618. No descendants of this marriage have been identified. * John Crackston (Jr.) was born about 1602, also presumably in England. He never married. He is believed to have died of a fever in the winter 1627-1628 brought on by frostbite caused by being lost in the forest. Per Bradford, John Crackston Jr. died five or six years after their arrival on the Mayflower although it was probably later than that as he appears in the 1627 Division of Cattle, appearing as \\"John Crakstone\\" with the Allerton family. His name also appeared in the 1623 Division of Land as \\"John Crackston\\" with the Winslow family.

Milestone's offers a number of financial services to operators in 25 countries on six continents, including operational leasing, debt solutions, short-term leasing options, and long-term asset management programs. Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Milestone has their own additional operations in Columbus, Ohio, as well as GECAS offices around the globe. Milestone currently touts a fleet of approximately 240 helicopters used in the offshore oil and gas industries, search and rescue, emergency medical services, police surveillance, mining, and other utility missions.  History  Milestone Aviation Group was founded in August 2010 by Richard Santulli. Santulli has nearly 40 years of experience in helicopters, private jets and finance industries. He is known for inventing the fractional jet ownership industry and growing NetJets into a multinational corporation. Milestone is based in Dublin, Ireland, where the company can benefit from Ireland‚Äôs skill set and tax infrastructure. After the late-2000s economic crisis that broke some of the world‚Äôs biggest financial institutions, helicopter operators lacked the access to capital needed to modernize and invest in new equipment demanded by clients. Milestone Aviation emerged in the helicopter industry as an alternative financing option to address this underserved market niche. In June 2015, the acquisition of Milestone Aviation by GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) saw the long-time aviation financier move into helicopter finance and leasing for the first time.  Corporate affairs  The company is run by a board of directors made up of a small number of shareholders and company members. Richard Santulli, founder and former chair and CEO of NetJets, serves as chairman of Milestone‚Äôs board of directors. Brian Humphries, president and CEO of the European Business Aviation Association, also serves on Milestone‚Äôs advisory board. Santulli brought members of the NetJets management team with him to head Milestone. Pat Sheedy is the current CEO.  Financial  Milestone Aviation Group secured $500 million of equity capital commitments to launch its business. U.S. middle-market private equity firm The Jordan Company led the investor team, in partnership with Nautic Partners. Since launching in August 2010, Milestone Aviation has leased more than 40 aircraft. Some of Milestone‚Äôs most notable deals include an order for sixteen (16) EC225s (valued at $480 million) and three (3) Sikorsky S-92s, which join a fleet of seven (7) S-76C++ and four additional S-92s. In 2012, Milestone agreed with Bristow Group Inc. (BRS) to lease five helicopters including two EC-225s and three S-92s, estimated value is $139 million. In its first year of operation, Milestone closed deals with Aeroservicios Especializados S.A. de C.V. (ASESA), CareFlite, Global Vectra Helicorp, Helijet International Inc., Omni Taxi Aereo, and Inaer. The company currently has an asset portfolio representing more than $500 million in financing commitments and holds leases with three of the four largest global helicopter operators, including Bristow, CHC and Inaer.

Biography =Early years= Fuller E. Callaway was born in the county seat of LaGrange in Troup County, Georgia, on July 15, 1870, the son of a second-generation Baptist minister,Gary N. Mock, \\"Fuller E. Callaway, LaGrange, GA,\\" www.textilehistory.org/, 2009. Rev. Abner Reeves Callaway. His mother, the former Sarah Jane Howard, died when Fuller was 8 years old.Kaye Lanning Minchew, \\"Callaway Family: Fuller Earle Callaway,\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia online, last update: Aug. 17, 2009. Entrepreneurial in spirit from his youth, at age 18 Callaway made use of $500 he had saved in addition to borrowed starting capital and launched a dime store in his native LaGrange. He followed the business model established by F.W. Woolworth & Co. Callaway's venture proved successful. After expansion, his Callaway Department Store became the largest such firm in LaGrange and the flagship of a small regional chain. =Textile manufacturer= Callaway's success as a dry goods merchant provided him with capital of his own. In 1895 he invested in LaGrange's first modern textile manufacturing facility, Dixie Mills. Callaway later recalled: > It was like the measles in the South in those days. Every town wanted to > build a cotton mill.... We did not have much of anything, but we got up a > cotton mill; and auctioned off the directorships. Anybody that would take > $5,000 worth of stock, we would make a director; and if a widow with a son > had $2,000, we would make the son a bookkeeper.... A good many of the > laborers took stock in it. We had a great many poor white people with the > highest type of morality and religion. They could not produce cotton at five > cents a pound against the negro; and these men began to move to town as > cotton mill operatives. Although the mill was originally run with managers brought to the South from New England, investors soon prevailed upon Callaway to take over the active management of the facility himself. The operation was put onto a sound footing, and Callaway cashed out his stock in the operation, determined to leave the textile business. This decision proved to be short-lived, however. In 1901, Callaway was a leading investor in a new facility, Unity Mills. Callaway worked as secretary-treasurer of the company, later known as Kex Plant, and continued to reinvest his profits over the subsequent two decades. He opened several other mills within a 100-mile radius of LaGrange. Callaway subsequently expanded his regional empire into other businesses, helping to launch such firms as the LaGrange National Bank, the LaGrange Savings Bank, Security Warehouse Company, the Callaway Development Company, and the Manchester Development Company. Callaway served as Railroad Commissioner of Georgia from 1907 to 1909, an appointed position. For a time he was the president of the American Cotton Manufacturers Association. In 1919 Callaway was named by President Woodrow Wilson as one of 22 members of a blue ribbon Industrial Relations Committee. They met in October of that year in an attempt to negotiate broad agreement on wages and prices in the rapidly evolving post- World War I American economy, but were unsuccessful. It was an era of strikes in major industries as workers struggled for better wages and working conditions, while the economy was absorbing thousands of veterans returning to the work force.Laurence Todd, \\"Steel Strike May Begin Labor‚Äôs Last Big Battle With Industrial Barons: Bitterness and Violence Seen as Certain Results ‚Äî Wilson‚Äôs October 6 Conference Mildly Amuses Wall Street Interests,\\" New York Call, vol. 12, no. 264 (Sept. 21, 1919), pg. 2. =Death and legacy= Fuller E.

The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #2000-40; the first American publication was in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #635, in August 2003. Plot Donald Duck is driving his nephews to the Mexican Junior Woodchucks jamboree and they feel sorry for Donald because he does not have any friends. Jos√© Carioca, an old friend of Donald's, is at the hotel where Donald is heading, flirting with a woman named Rosa. Her boyfriend, the bandit Alfonso Bedoya appears and tries to kill Josƒì, who jumps from the window into Donald's rumble seat. Alfonso tries to shoot them, but they escape. Donald and Jos√© remembering the old days, decide to teach Alfonso a lesson, but Donald takes a wrong turn and they find themselves lost in the desert. They are being shot at by Panchito Pistoles, their old friend. Panchito explains that he found a map to the lost city of Tayopa, a silver mining city, which they find buried in lava except for the church's belfry. Because of his many treasure hunts with his rich uncle Scrooge McDuck, Donald is able to identify the church as the headquarters for the Tayopa silver mine, so the friends climb down and find wooden kegs of pure silver ingots in a secret store room. They carry it to a nearby village and put it on a train to the city of El Divisadero. While the train is being loaded with mine carts our heroes enter a cantina where they meet Alfonso again. He was looking for Panchito because of his map. They perform a musical number, but get knocked off by Alfonso, who hijacks the train, but the caballeros use Donald's car to jump on the last flatcar. During their fight with Alfonso, the train engineer cuts them loose and they are on a runaway train on the world's most dangerous railroad track. Alfonso falls from the train right to the jail. The caballeros derail the silver kegs' flatcar and escape their fall to copper canyon in Donald's car. However, they find out that the kegs were not of silver after all, but mercury used to refine crushed ore and make it easy to remove from, so nothing of value was lost. They ride back to the hotel in Divisadero and perform a special act, which the nephews attend and are happy to see Donald with his old friends.

It was closed in 1945 and is now in agricultural use. History After the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, the area was surveyed by military engineers looking for a suitable location to establish a Luftwaffe military airfield. During 1941 Vlamertinge airfield was begun by a construction team, although most of the construction was begun on land near the village of Dikkebus, a few KM south. A grass runway was laid out and some buildings of wood were set up. In 1942, a 4 km length of ring road was constructed and a 2,000' concrete runway was laid out. The ring road had branches to various hardstands and maintenance shops, and some small aircraft shelters. It is unknown which Luftwaffe units used the facility during the period of German occupation. After the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, the Germans destroyed the runway on 10 June, and later the buildings on 2 September. The landing field was plowed up and electrical wiring was removed. British forces moved through the area in late 1944 and aviation engineers were able to restore the base for operations by Royal Air Force fighter and Allied transport aircraft. It was re-designated Advance Landing Ground B-59. The RAF continued operations from the field until March 1945, when it was abandoned and turned over to local authorities. Over the years, the runway was removed and the land returned to agricultural use. Many old German buildings were converted to agricultural buildings and are still scattered around the area.

It describes itself as \\"a community within the Anglican Communion committed to promote, teach and maintain the Scriptural truths on which the Anglican Church was founded\\". It is best known through its website, which posts items of interest or concern to its constituency. The convenor of the organization's UK steering committee is Philip Giddings.Anglican Mainstream: Who we are Britain and Ireland It brings together Anglicans in the British Isles who are concerned to maintain a traditional position on controversial issues. Participating organisations include evangelical groups in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, such as Reform, Church Society, the Church of England Evangelical Council, the New Wine network, the Scottish Anglican Network and mission agencies. It has close links with similar groups in North America and South Africa. Anglican realignment Anglican Mainstream is also involved in partnering with growing churches in the developing world through Anglican International Development (AID). It has strong links with the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans, and supports the Anglican realignment and the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON). Social conservatism Anglican Mainstream is concerned about a number of social issues including abortion and end of life issues, the status of marriage and family, evangelism, the cultural challenge of secular society and general Anglican church life in Britain and overseas. Of all the issues with which it is concerned, its stance on issues of sexuality has drawn controversy, particularly its support for sexual abstinence for homosexual people and the ex-gay movement, which it considers to be a minority group often ignored or silenced. Liberal pro-homosexuality groups such as Changing Attitude have been particularly opposed to Anglican Mainstream, especially over their view that homosexual orientation is an unalterable fact of human nature.\\"The Royal College of Psychiatrists believes strongly in evidence based treatment. There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Furthermore, so-called treatments of homosexuality create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination flourish.\\" http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/rcpsychposstatementsexorientation.pdf In 2012, Anglican Mainstream was part of a coalition of Christian groups intending to run a two-week campaign in which some London buses would carry an advertisement reading \\"Not gay! Post-gay, ex-gay and proud. Get over it!\\" in the same style as adverts produced by Stonewall, the gay rights group. The intention was to draw attention to the existence of ex-gays and the possibility of change, a claim which is contradicted by some mainstream psychologists. After receiving appropriate permissions the campaign was then prohibited by London's mayor, Boris Johnson, because of the offence he believed it would cause.

The regulated trading of certain swaps is a result of requirements in the United States by the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (in particular Title VII)., ¬ß 733 Financial swaps have traditionally been traded in over-the- counter (OTC) markets. However, regulatory changes have driven reporting, clearing, and settlement functions to SEFs, which are much more tightly regulated.http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/understanding_derivatives/understanding_derivatives_chapter_3_over_the_counter_derivatives.pdf The SEF-execution mandate responds to one of the four derivatives-related European Union, have proposed similar changes in swap market structure but none have yet been adopted. As of October 2, 2013, any swap listed by a SEF may be traded by the parties on the SEF, but may also be traded off-SEF in any other lawful manner. The swaps that must be traded on SEFs are both subject to a CFTC-centralized clearing mandate and have been determined to be \\"made available to trade\\" (MAT) by at least one SEF. Four categories of interest rate swaps and two categories of credit default swaps are currently subject to clearing mandates. Regulation * The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for regulating dealing and trading in security-based swaps, such as many equity swaps and credit default swaps. Proposed rules for security-based Swap Execution Facilities (SB-SEFs) have been pending since 2011. * The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is responsible for regulating the dealing and trading of a much wider range of over-the-counter derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, commodity-linked swaps and certain FX, credit default swaps, and equity swaps. CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton suggested that the primary benefits will be greater transparency, improved price formation, and better regulatory compliance. The CFTC's final SEF rules went into effect in August 2013 and the first SEFs began operating in October 2013. Previously operating swap trading platforms with multiple-to-multiple trading capability within the regulatory definition of \\"swap execution facility\\" could no longer operate legally without registering with the CFTC.Swapping Opinions, FIXGlobal, September 2011 The SEF launch on October 2, 2013, was facilitated by a CFTC guidance letter and several conditional and time-limited grants of relief from enforcement against non-compliance with certain technical elements. However, the CFTC in its no-action letters did not grant relief for SEFs from the October 2, 2013 deadline requiring swap trading venues to register. The CFTC regulations further require SEF's to report certain data arising from the execution of a swap to a swap data repository either for real-time public dissemination or confidential regulatory use. Regulations require that if a swap is executed on a SEF, the SEF must provide written confirmation of the terms to each counterparty. After the CFTC certified Javelin Capital Markets SEF's Made Available to Trade (MAT) Submission on January 16, 2014, certain swaps were required to trade on SEFs as of February 15, 2014.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, January, 2014  Entities in the swaps industry  = Established entities = * TrueEX Group * ICAP (company) * 360 Trading Networks * Bloomberg L.P. * BGC Partners * CME Group * LCH.Clearnet * Eris Exchange * Eurex * FX Alliance Inc.

Organisation BIRD was established in 2001. The founder, trustee, chairman and coordinator is P.N. Benjamin. Another founding member was Fr. Mathew Chandrankunnel, a professor of Philosophy of Science and Registrar and Director of the Centre for the Study of world Religions at the Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram, Bangalore. BIRD is supported entirely through donations from well-wishers. These are not income tax exempt. Public statements The BIRD coordinator P.M. Benjamin is often quoted as an opponent of activism among Christians. After an attack on a Mysore church in February 2002 a team from BIRD and from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh visited to ascertain what had happened. The BIRD team was led by P.N. Benjamin, who called for calm among Christians, saying \\"the need of the hour is to unitedly follow Christ's prayer amidst his agony on the cross ‚Äî forgive them for they know not what they do ... Christians must learn to talk to their enemies for overcoming their sense of alienation and insecurity and halt the march of misunderstanding between communities\\". P. N. Benjamin was cited in the 2003 report A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF) by Ramesh Nagaraj Rao, Narayanan Komerath and others. According to this report, Benjamin had said that Catholic and Protestant organisations had received far more money from abroad than Hindu and Muslim organisations combined, \\"especially the fundamentalist, and born-again Christian organisations that spread hatred against Hinduism ... Hindu-baiters are making a mountain out of a molehill while they themselves thrive under the shade of foreign funds\\". He was also quoted as saying \\"the biased Indian English media has always suppressed facts and encouraged the enemies of the country who received millions of foreign funds to tarnish the nation‚Äôs image everywhere by giving wide publicity to the so-called Global Council of Indian Christians and other vested interests. In September 2005 the website \\"christianaggression.org\\" published an article titled \\"When Intolerance Begets the Loss of Reason\\" that apparently had been published in the Vijay Times on 9 September 2005, written by P. N. Benjamin. John Dayal, president of the All India Catholic Union and a member of the National Integration Council, had accused Hindu political organisations of atrocities such as raping nuns and murdering priests. The author said that Dayal \\"opens his mouth and wields his pen only to spew venom on the Hindu community\\". He said that most attacks on Christians were due to aggressive evangelising. In February 2012 P.N. Benjamin dismissed claims that the 2008 attacks on Christians in southern Karnataka numbered over a thousand. He said \\"It is just an exaggeration. I feel there have been a handful of attacks, which were instigated by some fringe Christian groups\\". He said these groups received funding from American Pentacostal churches. A group of Indian Christians issued a letter on 1 January 2007 to various world leaders entitled A Campaign Declaration: Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue (BIRD). In it they asserted that the 1977 ruling by India's Supreme Court that a citizen had the right to \\"profess, practice and propagate\\" ones religion does not include the right to convert another. The group called for a change to Article 18 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to prohibit conversion through material incentives, coercion, threats or intimidation. However, the BIRD members affirmed the Great Commission that \\"unequivocally calls us to witness to Christ in a pluralistic setting\\". Stanley Samartha memorial lectures The BIRD runs inter-faith seminars and discussion sessions, and arranges annual lectures in memory of the theologian Stanley Jedidiah Samartha. Dr. Samartha once called himself a Hindu by culture, Christian by faith, Indian by citizenship and ecumenical by choice. Speakers at these lectures have included: * Fran√ßois Gautier (2001) The need for inter-religious dialogue *C.T. Kurien, economist and Director Emeritus of Madras Institute of Development Studies (2003) Communal harmony ‚Äì A societal perspective *M.V.

The problem of religious pluralism to an audience of over 350.

It stars Daya Vaidya, Aaliyah Franks, Darrin Henson, and Obba Babatund√©.  Plot  While pulling an April Fools' Day prank on a nerdy classmate named Melvin, a group of high school friends (Missy, DeAnna, Eva, Diego, Malik, and Marlin) accidentally kill him when Marlin hits Melvin with a football, causing him to fall on and he is impaled by a piece of rebar as a result. Panicking, the group drag Melvin's body into a wooded area, and stage it to look like he was the victim of a random gang-related attack. Exactly one year later, DeAnna is stabbed to death by a hooded figure while interning at a hospital. After murdering DeAnna, the killer writes \\"April Fools\\" on a wall with her blood. Hearing about DeAnna's death, Missy meets up with the others, convinced that DeAnna's murder may have something to do with Melvin's death, though her worries are dismissed. Later, Eva is stabbed in a locker room after dance practice by the same hooded assailant, who once again writes \\"April Fools\\" on a wall in blood. Unaware of Eva's death, Missy goes to the high school's Spring Jam, despite being unnerved by surveillance footage of DeAnna's murder, accidentally left in her room by her detective father. At the Spring Jam, Missy recognizes the attending killer from the surveillance footage, and looks for help from Malik after witnessing Diego and a teacher be murdered. Malik and the killer fight, sparking a brawl on the dance floor that covers the killer's escape after he fatally stabs Malik. Along with the other revelers, Missy is rounded up by the authorities, and at the police station she admits to her and her friends' involvement in Melvin's death to her father. A police officer escorts Missy home, where she is confronted by \\"the April Fools Killer\\" - Marlin, who has killed the officer, and the one stationed at his house. Marlin claims that he was only one affected by Melvin's death, his life falling to shambles after it while everyone else easily moved on, enraging him. Marlin attacks Missy, but she manages to briefly incapacitate him and get outside, a recovered Marlin giving chase. Marlin soon catches up with Missy but is killed in self defense when she hits him with a rock, and turns his own blade on him. Stumbling away from Marlin's body, Missy collapses into the arms of her father, who had gone out looking for her after piecing together the April Fools Killer's identity.

Otherwise, you might end up blowing your brains out. What feels like a film with production values above typical 'urban horror' fare turns out to be frustratingly devoid of quality. But where quality is lacking, camp appeal reigns supreme, and if camp is April Fools' ultimate goal, it's downright brilliant. This is a perfect storm of incompetence on all fronts: acting, writing, direction, editing, continuity, special effects, and basic human decency.\\" The acting and script were criticized by Blogcritics, which gave the closing statement, \\"April Fools fooled the hell out of me. I thought it was a horror film, but it turned out to be a bad joke.\\" April Fools was described as being like \\"a glorified YouTube video\\" that had \\"no style, no substance\\" by Direct to Video Connoisseur. Film Critics United said, \\"The young actors struggle with their lines, the story ‚Äì though liberally stolen ‚Äì stole only the worthless parts of movies that weren't that good anyway, the ending was completely outlandish, the camera work was spotty at best, and it wasn't scary. In fact it was quite funny.\\" Horror Movie a Day found the film terrible and awkward, and wrote that \\"it's so short (72 minutes, with lots of easily skippable padding) and lovingly stupid that I can't really muster up the energy to go off on it\\" and that to do so would be like \\"berating an infant for not knowing how to drive\\". A score of one out of a possible five was given by Slasherpool, which said the story was thin, the actors incompetent, the direction dreadful, the death scenes pathetic, and the picture quality extremely poor.

A successor to the previous HTC Evo 4G and 3D models, the Evo 4G LTE supports Sprint's LTE cellular network and its current- generation EV-DO network. The Evo 4G LTE shares features with its GSM counterpart, the HTC One Xsuch as the same dual-core 1.5 GHz processor used by the One X's LTE variant, a 4.7-inch screen, and Android 4.1 with HTC's Sense 4.0 interface. The Evo 4G LTE was also the first phone built with an all aluminum frame, leaving only a small plastic piece to allow the Sim and micro sd cards to be installed. After a slight delay imposed by a patent infringement lawsuit, the Evo 4G LTE began shipping on May 24, 2012 to customers who pre-ordered the phone on Sprint's website. It was then released on a nationwide basis on June 2, 2012.Albanesius, Chloe. (2012-05-31) After Patent Delay, HTC EVO 4G LTE Arrives on Sprint June 2  News & Opinion. PCMag.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-18. Release The Evo 4G LTE was unveiled in April 2012 as one of the first LTE-enabled smartphones to be released by Sprint, and as a successor to the Evo 4G. The Evo 4G LTE officially became available for pre-order from Sprint on May 7, 2012. On June 2, 2012 the HTC Evo 4G LTE was released. After an announced May 18 release date for the Evo 4G LTE, shipments of both the Evo 4G LTE and the HTC One X were delayed by U.S. Customs by order of the International Trade Commission, to ensure that its software complied with an import ban imposed on HTC over products violating a \\"data tapping\\" patent owned by Apple Inc., relating to displaying a menu of options when clicking on an email or phone number. On May 21, 2012, the Taipei Times reported that the HTC One X and HTC EVO 4G LTE shipment had cleared US Customs and was entering the United States. Following the report from the Taipei Times, Sprint confirmed the article and announced that the HTC EVO 4G LTE is expected to start shipping Thursday, May 24, 2012 to those who pre- ordered online. To comply with the ruling, such actions are pre-set to particular apps and can only be modified within a new \\"App Associations\\" menu.  Features  The Evo 4G LTE is visibly and technologically similar to its GSM counterpart, the HTC One X. As a result, it shares many of its features and functionality with the One X, but still features other slight differences. = Kickstand = The Sprint CDMA variant of the handset once again featured the kickstand, popular with users of the HTC Evo 4G and watching videos = Screen and input = The Evo 4G LTE utilizes a 720p 4.7 inch Super LCD 2 display, with a pixel-density of 312 ppi. As with the One X, the Evo 4G LTE utilizes three capacitive keys on the front of the phone for the Back, Home, and Recent Apps functions, along with a power button and volume rocker. Unlike the One X, the Evo 4G LTE also features a camera button. As with other Sense 4.0 phones, applications that require the now deprecated \\"Menu\\" button from previous versions of Android display this button on a bar at the bottom of the screen when needed. = Processor and memory = Like the LTE variants of the One X, the Evo 4G LTE utilizes a 1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8960 processor, with 1024 MB of RAM. = Cameras = The Evo 4G LTE features a rear-facing 8-megapixel camera capable of shooting 1080p videos, as well as a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera. It also features HTC's \\"ImageSense\\" chip, which allows for increased camera functionality, such as the ability to shoot burst shots at 4 pictures per second, as well as take pictures while recording video. = Storage = The Evo 4G LTE features 16 GB of internal storage. Unlike the One X, the Evo 4G LTE also includes a Micro SDHC card slot, supporting up to 32 GB Class 10 of additional storage. = Audio and output= As with other contemporary HTC phones, the Evo 4G LTE featured Beats Audio technology, providing better audio quality. = Connectivity = The Evo 4G LTE features a CDMA cellular radio that supports 3G, EV-DO, as well as Sprint's LTE network. The phone will also be the first Sprint phone to support HD voice. It does not operate on Sprint's 2G iDEN network. More importantly, it does not work on Sprint's 4G WiMAX network. This means that a customer moving from previous generation Sprint 4G WiMAX phones such as the Evo 4G/3D may see drastically slower speeds if they are not in a 4G LTE area. = Battery and power = The device features an integrated 2000 mAh battery. = Software= As with other recent HTC phones, the Evo 4G LTE is pre-loaded with Android 4.0 and HTC's Sense 4.0 user interface. A software update for the EVO 4G LTE began rolling out to users on August 29, 2012. The update included several software fixes, Android version 4.0.4, and version 4.1 of HTC Sense. On December 13, 2012 Android 4.1 and Sense 4+ was rolling out with many new features including a new interface and Android version 4.1. On February 3, 2013 a new software update came out fixing the bugs and issues of Android 4.1 and Sense 4+ relating to the proximity sensor and camera. In October 2013, a new software update started rolling out. It made HD Voice over Sprint on by default. While HTC had apparently stated that the EVO 4G LTE would be updated to Android 4.3 via an update from them (rather than Sprint), that update has been pulled and abandoned. While not officially updated past Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, it can still run Android versions up to at least 5.0 Lollipop via community support.

Huang began his political career in Shanghai and was transferred to Chongqing in 2001 as its Deputy Mayor, before being promoted to Mayor in 2010. Career Huang was born in Zhuji, Zhejiang province. During the Cultural Revolution he worked in a coking factory. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1976. His political career began in Shanghai's Pudong New Area in 1993. Between 1994 and 1995 Huang served as the Director of the Policy Research Office of the Communist Party organization in Shanghai. Between 1995 and 2001 Huang served as the Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Between 1998 and 1999 Huang took on a one-year stint pursuing his Executive MBA at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) in Shanghai. Huang was transferred to work in Chongqing in 2001, several years after the city was elevated to \\"Direct- controlled Municipality\\" status equivalent to that of Shanghai. He was the city's Deputy Mayor from 2001 to 2009 and sat on the Communist Party's Chongqing Standing Committee. Huang is unique in that he has served under four Chongqing Party Secretaries He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, and Zhang Dejiang, each with their unique set of policies and political beliefs, and all of whom went on to become prominent politicians at the national level. Huang is therefore considered a \\"political survivor\\", and has been dubbed the sichao yuanlao (; roughly, \\"he who served four emperors.\\"). Huang was considered a key political ally of Bo Xilai, who abruptly fell out of favour with the national leadership following the Wang Lijun incident in February 2012. Many believe that Huang's political career had come to an end due to his association with Bo and the appointment of Zhang Dejiang as party secretary for Chongqing following Bo's dismissal in March 2012. During a televised government meeting, Huang expressed his support for Zhang. He was elected to the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2012, and re- elected Mayor of Chongqing in January 2013.

He has done stunts for over 300 movies and television programs and runs a stunt school in Groveland, Florida that has trained over 15,000 students. Early life and military service Unable to read or write, Kahana dropped out of school in third grade. At age 13 he hitchhiked across the United States by himself, sometimes stealing in order to eat. His performing career began as a knife and fire dancer in a stage show called Samoan Warriors. Kahana served as a paratrooper in the Korean War where he was captured and shot by an enemy firing squad. Feigning death, he was left by his captors in a mass grave from which he escaped. A hand grenade explosion also rendered him sightless for two years and permanently blind in his left eye. The U.S. military awarded Kahana a Silver Star and two Bronze Star Medals, as well as two Purple Hearts for his services. In 1955, Kahana survived a plane crash in the state of Texas that killed the other 32 other people on board. Surviving this crash and his experiences in Korea imbued Kahana with a personal life philosophy of, \\"Maybe I'm right where I ought to be.\\" Film, television and stunt career Kahana entered film after the Korean War, working as an extra, playing a motorcycle rider in 1953's The Wild One. When he saw that stunt performers were paid more than extras, he pursued a stunt career, training with Yakima Canutt and John Eppers. By the 1960s and throughout the 70s and 80s, he worked steadily as a stuntman for many films including Cool Hand Luke (1967), Planet of the Apes 1968, Che! (1969), Patton (1970), The Omega Man (1971), Joe Kidd (1972), Soylent Green (1973), Burt Reynolds' Smokey and the Bandit franchise, and the disaster films of Irwin Allen. Kahana also doubled for Charles Bronson in his films for over 20 years. Kahana also performed and coordinated fight scenes and stunts (often uncredited) for numerous TV shows, including 28 episodes of Kung Fu, and made numerous appearances on other programs, including Mission Impossible, The Six Million Dollar Man, Vega$, Magnum, P.I., Charlie's Angels, Quincy. Fantasy Island and The Brady Bunch. Because of his size (5' 7\\", or 168 cm) Kahana frequently acted as stunt double for female actors, including Stefanie Powers of The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. and Sally Field on The Flying Nun. In 1968, Kahana played a leading role in the Hanna-Barbera children's adventure serial Danger Island, a live-action serialized adventure story that appeared as part of the Banana Splits Adventure Hour. His character, Chongo, was a mute castaway from a shipwrecked merchant marine vessel who communicated only using hand signs and bird calls. As the comedic sidekick to fellow castaway Elihu Morgan (played by Rockne Tarkington), Chongo's antics prompted his friend to call out, \\"Uh-oh Chongo!\\". The catchphrase became popular with children during the following decade, and inevitably followed Kahana in his work and personal life. Because Danger Island aired weekly and Kahana worked both as an actor and as a stunt performer, he was one of the highest paid stunt people in the business. Over his first three decades of work as a stunt performer, Kahana broke his bones more than 60 times. By the 1980s, Kahana had moved away from doing \\"life-threatening\\" stunts while still continuing to coordinate action scenes and perform his own stunt work. Kahana has served as a member of the Stuntmen's Association of Motion Pictures and spent eight years on the Screen Actors Guild's Safety Investigative Team and the Stunt Safety Committee. He runs a production company called Stunt Action & Safety Coordinator, Inc. that runs second unit production for major motion pictures. He opened the Kahana Stunt School in 1972 to train performers in stunt work and safety, as well as how to navigate the motion picture and TV industries. Other work Kahana studied martial arts in Japan where he earned six black belts in karate, aikido and jujutsu. In addition to teaching stunts, he is a martial arts and hand-to-hand combat instructor and weapons expert. Kahana has also run a bodyguard agency, employing as many as 30 people at once. Personal life Kim Kahana had three sons (Tony, Rick, and Kim Jr.) and one daughter (Debbie), all of whom teach at Kahana's school, hold black belts in karate and have also performed in numerous blockbuster films. In 2005 Kahana Sr. married his wife Sandra, who works as the lead administrator for the stunt school. On July 24, 2012, Kim Kahana lost his son Rick Kalua Kahana, who died at his home in Canoga Park, California.

It was announced on April 3, 2012, by Markus Persson, the game's lead designer. The game was eventually indefinitely postponed because Persson found several creative blocks, citing the main problem as \\"it not being very fun to play\\". Persson then stated he will instead most likely continue to work on smaller projects for the rest of his life. The game has now been completely cancelled. The announced features include a fully working virtual computer, random encounters, an advanced economy system, and also single and multiplayer modes in a consistent universe, or \\"Multiverse\\".

Gameplay The list of features include engineering, space battles, seamless space-to-planet transitions, mining and trading, laser guns, and an open universe with both single-player and multiplayer variants. 0x10c features a working emulated 16-bit processor inside the game called the DCPU-16 that can be accessed through any of the monitors located in the game. The DCPU-16 can also load external programs and data using the required standards which allows the community to make their own DCPU-16 emulators. Development In December 2011, Markus Persson announced that he was going to be stepping down as the lead developer of Minecraft, and that he would be working on another project. Mojang CEO Carl Manneh said in an interview with Edge Online that Mojang was committed to supporting a new project that Persson was developing along with another game created by other developers in their company. After winning a special award from BAFTA in March 2012, Persson revealed that there were three different projects he was developing, but he had yet to come to a decision in terms of which one he was committed to working on. A few days later in an interview with PC Gamer magazine, Persson announced that he was working on a space-themed game that was inspired by the television show Firefly and the video game Elite. The first details of this game were released in an April Fool's parody website called \\"Mars Effect\\", a play on Mass Effect and alluding to the lawsuit by Bethesda Softworks over trademark infringement. A few days later Persson announced that he had chosen a real name for the game and that he had made some progress on its development. Although it is not immediately obvious how to pronounce the game's name and a large variety of suggestions were proposed, Persson has said that he pronounces it as \\"ten to the see,\\" but that \\"people can pronounce it however they want\\". On October 13, 2012, the first video gameplay of 0x10c was released by Persson on the game's website.First Gameplay Video On October 26, 2012, the first multiplayer test was uploaded to the website from Twitch.TV.First Multiplayer Gameplay Video In an April 2013 interview with Polygon, Persson stated that 0x10c development was hit by creative road block and would be put on hold. Persson also said that the game is \\"ways off\\" and that he would be expanding the team, bringing on one other developer to \\"make sure the game gets made.\\" On August 13, 2013, Persson confirmed in a live stream that 0x10c was indefinitely shelved, adding that the game could potentially be made in the future, if another Mojang employee were interested in continuing its development. = Art = \\"The style is pixel art meets modern 3D.

Persson said that this was because of the cost to \\"emulate all computers and physics even when players aren't logged in.\\" It is unknown if there was to be a private multiplayer mode. It was revealed that the pricing would be similar to Minecraft, with alpha costing less than beta, and beta costing less than the full release.

The airfield is currently the Training Center for Parachutists (TrgC Para) of the Belgian ParaCommandos. History =Origins= Schaffen Air Base was originally established about 1914 by the invading Imperial German Army during World War I. The Imperial German Air Service (Die Fliegertruppen) used it as an airfield before withdrawing in November 1918 after the Armistice with Germany. =Battle of Belgium= Between the wars, the airfield was a major base for the Belgian Air Force. In early 1940, about half of the Belgian Air Force, were stationed there prior to the Battle of Belgium in May. On the early morning of 10 May, the alarm was sounded, and the pilots at Schaffen Air Base went to their aircraft, thinking it was an exercise. A few minutes later, 50 unidentified aircraft flew over the airfield. At 04:20am Belgian Hawker Hurricanes at the airfield started their engines. 12 minutes later, three Luftwaffe Heinkel He-111s were spotted, not troubled by AAA fire. The 111s strafed the airfield several times. The Belgian aircraft tried to take off through the explosions and fires. Minutes later Me-110s and Dornier Do-17s strafed and bombed the airfield. Four Hurricanes were set on fire, and 6 others were damaged. The roof of the hangar fell in and the aircraft in it were destroyed. By 5:30 AM, only five aircraft remained operational, two Hawker Hurricanes and three Glosters. After the attack, the survivors were flown off and the airfield abandoned. =Luftwaffe use= During the German occupation of Belgium, Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 (StG 1) formed at Schaffen as Erg.Staffel/St.G.1. It operated Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers from the field, attacking British shipping in the English Channel. The Stukas, however, suffered significant losses against RAF fighters over the channel and were withdrawn in August to bases in the Balkans. For the remainder of the occupation, Schaffen was a non-combat airfield of the Flughafen-Bereichs- Kommando 22/XI (Airport-area command 22/XI). = Royal Air Force use= The British Army moved through the Diest area, clearing the occupying German forces north into The Netherlands. Royal Engineers moved into the airfield and it was re-designated as Advanced Landing Ground B-64. It is unknown which RAF units used the field until the German Capitulation in May 1945. Casualties of British 1st Airborne Division (and others) from Operation Market Garden (Arnhem) were evacuated by 93 (Airborne) Composite Company RASC 1st Airborne Division (sometimes under heavy enemy fire) from Diest in September 1944. =Postwar use= After the war Schaffen became the location of the EVS (Elementary Flying School, or in Dutch: Elementaire Vliegschool). In 1950 the EVS left for Air Base Goetsenhoven however. Schaffen Air Base has also been the home of the Training Center for Parachutists (TrgC Para) of the Belgian ParaCommandos since 1946.

Life The son of Samuel Mayer, a tanner and currier, he was born at Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, on 23 February 1803. At the age of 20 he settled in Liverpool as a jeweller and goldsmith: successful in business, he was able to indulge his passion for collecting. In 1860 he devoted himself to the volunteer movement, and was captain of the Liverpool borough guard. He raised and clothed at his own expense a corps of volunteers at Bebington, near Birkenhead, Cheshire, where he went to live in 1860.Dictionary of National Biography, Mayer, Joseph (1803‚Äì1886), antiquary and collector, by C. W. Sutton. Published 1894. Mayer retired from business in 1873, and died unmarried at Pennant House, Bebington, Cheshire, on 19 January 1886, aged 82. His private library, prints and manuscripts were dispersed by auction in 1887. Collector Mayer acquired many thousands of drawings, engravings, and autograph letters relating to the history of art in England. He became the possessor of large portions of the collections of William Upcott and of Thomas Dodd, the print dealer and collector. Dodd was befriended in his latter days by Mayer, in whose house he died. In 1861 Mayer was deceived into purchasing some spurious papyri of the gospel of Matthew and other scriptures, concocted by the impostor Simonides, who also induced him to publish them. Bust of Joseph Mayer, by Giovanni Fontana. One of Mayer's earliest studies was Greek coins, his cabinet of which he sold to the French government in 1844. He opened his own museum in Colquitt Street, Liverpool. It ultimately reached great proportions, and embraced Egyptian antiquities, prehistoric and ethnographic curiosities, glass and pottery (especially Wedgwood ware; British and Anglo-Saxon antiquities, including W. H. Rolfe's collection and that of Saxon sepulchral remains made by Bryan Faussett. For this collection Mayer printed in 1856 a catalogue and history, compiled for him by Charles Roach Smith, entitled Inventorium Sepulchrale. Other sections of the museum contained antique ivories, gems and rings, enamels, miniatures, and metalwork. Patronage A number of books were printed wholly or in part at Mayer's expense, among them being: * Sprott's Chronicle, edited by Dr. William Bell, 1851. * Anglo-Saxon and Old English Vocabularies, edited by Thomas Wright, 2 vols. 1857 and 1873; a second edition, edited by Richard Paul W√ºlcker, was brought out in 1884. * Feudal Manuals of English History, edited by Thomas Wright, 1872. He assisted largely in the publication of Benjamin Thorpe's Diplomatarium Anglicum √Üvi Saxonici, 1865, and he supplied Eliza Meteyard with most of the materials for her Life of Wedgwood and Group of Englishmen. Works Mayer was one of the founders of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, of which he was president from 1866 to 1869. He contributed the following among other papers to its Transactions: * The Mock Mayor at Newcastle-under-Lyme. * Roscoe and the Influence of his Writings on the Fine Arts. * Shotwick Church. * Liverpool Pottery. * The Arming of Levies in the Hundred of Wirral. * Addresses as President. * The Preparations of the County of Kent to resist the Spanish Armada. * On the Art of Pottery. In 1876, he printed a volume on Early Exhibitions of Art in Liverpool, with some Notes for a Memoir of George Stubbs. Legacy His museum, valued at ¬£80,000, was presented by Mayer to the corporation of Liverpool in 1867, and became part of the public museum in William Brown Street there. It is now at the World Museum. Objects include the Anglo-Saxon Kingston Brooch. He had previously disposed of a collection of objects of art relating to the Bonaparte family, but at the death of the owner (Mr. Mather) it was bequeathed to the corporation.{sfnSutton1894}} Mayer Park, Bebington, Wirral, Merseyside. In 1866, Mayer established a free library of twenty thousand volumes in Bebington, and endowed it. The library stood in public grounds (six acres), which he also dedicated to the use of the people. He founded two scholarships at the Newcastle-under-Lyme high school, and presented drawings and pictures. A marble statue of Mayer, by Giovanni Fontana, was placed by the Liverpool corporation in St. George's Hall in September 1869. His portrait was presented by subscribers to the Bebington Free Library in 1872.

Block scheme of control system. G(s) ‚Äì linear transfer function, f(e) ‚Äì single-valued, continuous, differentiable function Kalman's conjecture or Kalman problem is a disproved conjecture on absolute stability of nonlinear control system with one scalar nonlinearity, which belongs to the sector of linear stability. Kalman's conjecture is a strengthening of Aizerman's conjecture and is a special case of Markus‚ÄìYamabe conjecture. This conjecture was proven false but led to the (valid) sufficient criteria on absolute stability.  Mathematical statement of Kalman's conjecture (Kalman problem) In 1957 R. E. Kalman in his paper stated the following: > If f(e) in Fig. 1 is replaced by constants K corresponding to all possible > values of f'(e), and it is found that the closed-loop system is stable for > all such K, then it intuitively clear that the system must be monostable; > i.e., all transient solutions will converge to a unique, stable critical > point. Kalman's statement can be reformulated in the following conjecture: > Consider a system with one scalar nonlinearity'' : > \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=Px+qf(e),\\\\quad e=r^*x \\\\quad x\\\\in R^n, where P is a constant > n√ón matrix, q, r are constant n-dimensional vectors, ‚àó is an operation of > transposition, f(e) is scalar function, and f(0) = 0\\\\. Suppose, f(e) is a > differentiable function and the following condition'' : k_1 < f'(e)< k_2. \\\\, > is valid. Then Kalman's conjecture is that the system is stable in the large > (i.e. a unique stationary point is a global attractor) if all linear systems > with f(e) = ke, k ‚àà (k1, k2) are asymptotically stable. In Aizerman's conjecture in place of the condition on the derivative of nonlinearity it is required that the nonlinearity itself belongs to the linear sector. Kalman's conjecture is true for n ‚â§ 3 and for n > 3 there are effective methods for construction of counterexamples: the nonlinearity derivative belongs to the sector of linear stability, and a unique stable equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic solution (hidden oscillation). In discrete-time, the Kalman conjecture is only true for n=1, counterexamples for n ‚â• 2 can be constructed.

It shares many features with the Canon EOS 1D X. It was publicly announced on April 12, 2012, and was released in March 2013 with suggested retail price of (body only). The Canon EOS-1D C is stated to be the world's first 4K resolution DSLR camera. The 1D C has a full frame sensor but uses an APS-H-sized portion to record 4K resolution (4096 x 2160 pixels) video at 24p and 25p without downscaling in Y'CbCr 4:2:2 format. The pixel size of the sensor is 6.95 Œºm and records 4K in 8-bit 4:2:2 using Motion JPEG. The other modes in 8-bit 4:2:0, using MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 IBP or ALL-I format. Uncompressed video over HDMI up to 1080p is also possible. In November 2013, Canon announced that the 1D C was the first DSLR to meet the European Broadcasting Union HD Tier 1 requirements for use in HD broadcast production. In an interview in February 2016, Canon Product Manager Roger Machin announced that the 1D C would be succeeded by the 1D X Mark II, however the 1D X Mk II lacks the unlimited recording, and log gamma found on the 1D C. Features The Canon EOS-1D C can use more than sixty interchangeable Canon lenses, and features the Canon Log Gamma , by which an estimated preview of footage after grading helps the videographer with focusing and determining exposure whilst retaining maximum latitude in captured image data. An ISO setting range from 50 to 204,800 can be selected automatically or adjusted manually. The camera also allows the user to view the LCD screen while the HDMI port is in use on an external device and includes a headphone jack. The 1D C shares the same battery that is used in the EOS-1D X, the LP-E4N. Like all Canon DSLR full frame cameras, the 1D does not feature a built in flash. EOS Utility and Picture Style Editor software is included in the purchase of the product which enables the user to adjust several settings from a computer. Like the Canon EOS 5D Mark III and Canon EOS-1D X, the camera features 61 autofocus points, which are assisted by a 100,000-pixel metering sensor. The camera's viewfinder has an estimated magnification of .76x and 100% field of view. Remote control from computer is possible using the built in USB or Ethernet connector. The camera can be operated remotely with a Canon WFT-E6A Wireless File Transmitter, allowing an external web enabled device to control the camera. The WFT-E6A Wireless File Transmitter unit also enables Bluetooth v2.1 +EDR, to embed GPS location data into files. Accessories According to Canon's website, the EOS 1D C model comes equipped with: * EOS-1D C Body * Eyecup E.g. * LP-E4N Battery Pack * LC-E4N Battery Charger * Cable Protector and Clamp * Stereo AV Cable (AVC- DC400ST) * USB Interface Cable (model IFC-200U) * Wide Camera Strap L7 Known defects Canon issued a product advisory indicating that in some units, due to insufficient lubrication within the camera's driving mechanism, \\"the autofocus searches but does not lock in on the subject\\" and \\"the image shown in the viewfinder is ‚Äúblurry‚Äù or ‚Äúnot steady‚Äù\\". Any bodies sold with the issue have been recalled by Canon. Other On February 1, 2015, Canon reduced the price of the Eos 1D C model by $4,000 from the current price of $11,999 to $7,999. On December 13, 2016, Canon reduced the price of the Eos 1D C model once again by another $3,000 from the current price of $7,999 to $4,999.

He was educated at the Fort Augustus Abbey until December 1894 when he transferred to St Bede's College, Manchester, for a year. In 1895 he was sent to France to complete his education. Early career Upon returning to Dumfries, Carmont served an apprenticeship with a local law firm and qualified as a solicitor in 1903, he then studied further law at Edinburgh University and was called to the bar in 1906, taking silk in 1924 and becoming part of the Scottish Senior Bar. Career on the bench In May 1934, Carmont was appointed a Senator of the College of Justice in succession to Lord Sands and took the Judicial Title of Lord Carmont. Lord Carmont remained as a Judge of the Outer House for only three years, after which record period of time he was appointed to the First Division.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat;=19650809&id;=XFxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=jaMMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6334,1036045, In 1952, when razor gangs were running amok in Glasgow, Lord Carmont went there from Edinburgh to preside over the High Court and after warning that future sentences might require to be more severe if the use of razors and other similar weapons did not cease forthwith, he then imposed sentences of up to 10 years' imprisonment on all those who appeared before him convicted of inflicting horrific injuries on others.

It is the first siddur to use non-sexist, inclusive language and to refer to God using feminine and masculine pronouns.  History  The first edition of Vetaher Libenu was published in 1975 by the lay people serving as the Ritual Committee of Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley, Sudbury, Massachusetts, led by C. Peter R. Gossels and Nancy Lee Gossels, its editors. This siddur was intended to fill ‚Äúa gap between the forms of prayer that they desired, and the Union Prayer Book‚Äù used by Reform congregations at the time, by restoring much of the traditional liturgy and offering translations that tried to capture in English the meaning of the original Hebrew. The committee also included many original poems, meditations and prayers composed by people on the committee. In 1979, the Ritual Committee decided to revise the entire siddur by \\"changing the masculine and feudal epithets for God [and] . . . to use language that would reestablish the dignity of women and have meaning for our children as well.\\" According to the introduction in Vetaher Libenu, the committee used the Book of Genesis 1:27 as a proof text to use masculine and feminine pronouns when referring to God. This verse can be translated from Hebrew as, ‚ÄúAnd God created human kind in God‚Äôs image; male and female God created them.‚Äù The committee substituted neutral terms, such as ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù Creator‚Äù and ‚ÄúHoly One,‚Äù for masculine metaphors ‚ÄúLord‚Äù and ‚ÄúKing.‚Äù The committee also introduced, for the first time, the matriarchs, Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah, into the liturgy, a practice adopted by all Reform siddurim since Vetaher Libenu's publication, as well as by some Conservative siddurim. The ‚Äúmost controversial change,‚Äù according to Nancy Gossels in a Boston Globe interview, ‚Äúwas the decision to use feminine pronouns in the Psalms in order to broaden and enrich the awareness and understanding of God, who is neither male nor female.‚Äù As stated by the siddur's editors in the Introduction, the committee was inspired by Martin Buber‚Äôs I and Thou to compose liturgy that addressed God most often as \\"You,\\" rather than \\"He\\" or \\"She,\\" in order to encourage a more personal bond between the reader and his or her God. Published in 1980, the second edition of Vetaher Libenu, edited by Nancy Lee Gossels, Joan S. Kaye, and C. Peter R. Gossels, was the first non-sexist Jewish prayer book ever published. In addition to the innovations described above, Nancy Lee Gossels and Joan S. Kaye revised the traditional Hebrew translation of or ‚ÄúPraised are You, Adonai our God, Ruler to the Universe,‚Äù to ‚ÄúHoly One of Blessing, Your Presence Fills Creation.‚Äù This invocation is now used by many Reform congregations. The book was copyrighted in 1980.  Religious significance  The publication of Vetaher Libenu was recognized as a significant event by The Wall Street Journal, which announced the news on its front page. Major newspapers in the United States and Canada ran articles describing the event. Publication of Vetaher Libenu and its historic contents was also announced and discussed on numerous TV and radio stations. Vetaher Libenu was reviewed in many publications, including: Worship 60, Sh'ma, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, and Genesis 2. Since 1980, Vetaher Libenu has been ‚Äúreviewed, cited, studied, copied and used by thousands of theologians, journalists, and laypeople. The book has been reprinted more than 14 times, and ‚Äúthousands of copies sold worldwide to Christians as well as Jews.‚Äù  Historical significance  Unlike traditional Jewish prayer books, a ‚Äúrabbi was not part of the committee that created it.‚Äù The rabbi of Congregation Beth El, author Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, did not participate in the process to revise the prayer book. Twenty percent of the orders for the Jewish prayer book have come from Christians. The original poetry in Vetaher Libenu has been copied, translated and anthologized in books across the world and used at prayer services by Jews and Christians. Some of these books include: Sarah's Daughters Sing, Singing the Living Tradition, Esther erhebt hire Stimme, Kol HaNeshamah, Celebrating the New Moon, The Torah: A Woman's Commentary, and Gebete von und fur Frauen aus Geschichte und Gegenwart.

Although introduced prior to World War I, most of its combat use was by PT boats in World War II. The torpedo was originally designed in 1911 by Frank McDowell Leavitt of the E. W. Bliss Company and entered full mass production in 1913 at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island. It was deployed on destroyers and battleships during World War I and cruisers built in the 1920s. All US battleships and most cruisers had their torpedo tubes removed by 1941. The Mark 8 remained in service through World War II on older destroyers, primarily the Wickes and Clemson classes. It also equipped PT boats early in World War II, but was replaced by the Mark 13 torpedo on most of these in mid-1943. Under the Lend-Lease Act, about 600 Mark 8 torpedoes were issued to the United Kingdom for use with 50 pre-1930 destroyers it received under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Design The design was originally intended to be used on destroyers in an anti-surface ship role. When it was first released, it was a highly advanced torpedo, but when it was actually deployed into service during World War II it was showing its age and unable to compete with modern torpedo technology. The low speed of the torpedo was one of the complaints; its Japanese counterpart, the Type 93 torpedo, was significantly faster and more difficult to spot in the water. Deployment difficulties The Mark 8 had many technical difficulties with its design that would be a bane to the torpedomen who would use them. The first issue came with the process of simply launching the torpedo, which was fraught with its own set of difficulties. The gyro in the torpedo was sensitive when it was first launched and it would need to be launched from an even keel, otherwise the torpedo would lose stability when it hit the water. The other issue concerned the launching mechanism. The initial system was set with a black powder charge to push the torpedo out of the tube. This was a problem in the South Pacific, where the humid climate would cause these charges to misfire, sometimes not putting enough force behind the torpedo to fully eject it from the tube. One other risk of these misfires was what is called \\"hot running\\", where the torpedo would run in its tube. Though the warhead could not detonate, the motor would overheat and explode without water to cool it, sending splinters across the deck. Another issue was that the tubes were heavily lubricated with oil and grease to ensure that the torpedo was smoothly launched from the tube. Sometimes during launch, the charge would ignite the lubricants in the tube causing a fire emitting black smoke that would reveal the location of the torpedo boat. The torpedo lacked the explosive power of newer models. It carried less than 500 pounds of TNT-based explosives, which was far from a guaranteed ship kill. This frustrated many captains who, when hitting an enemy dead on, had the warhead detonate but not sink the target, and many targets escaped.

His regnal numbers indicate that he was the second Bishop Albert of Halberstadt. His reign can be characterized as an almost unbroken series of conflicts with the Pope, his cathedral chapter, the city of Halberstadt and various neighbouring Lords and Princes.  Life  Albert was a younger son of Duke Albert II of Brunswick- L√ºneburg (d. 1318) and his wife, Rixa of Werle (d. 1317). While his eldest brother Otto succeeded their father as Duke, Albert joined the clergy at an early age and in 1319, he was already canon in Halberstadt. Soon afterwards, he was appointed provost of the St. Alexander minster in Einbeck. When Bishop Albert I of Halberstadt died on 14 September 1324, the cathedral chapter, on 6 October 1324, wrote a list of concessions his successor would have to agree to. The list included provisions on the jurisdiction of the archdeacon and episcopal officials, about real estate held by the cathedral provost and mortgaging the chapter's real estate. In the subsequent election, the largest number of votes was cast for Louis of Steindorf; Albert of Brunswick received only five votes. However, Archbishop Matthias of Mainz, who was the metropolitan bishop, opted for Albert II. Pope John XXII ignored the rights of the cathedral chapter and appointed Giseko of Holstein, who never came into actual possession of the bishopric, but continued to raise claims on it. During the interregnum between the death of Albert I and the confirmation of Albert II, the cathedral chapter had a conflict with the Principality of Anhalt about the Aschersleben territory and, almost simultaneously, a feud broke out between the chapter and the Regenstein counts Albert II and Bernard, who were the patrons of the city of Quedlinburg. Bishop Albert II captured Gunteken Castle, close to Quedlinburg, around Easter 1325, and as a result, the Halberstadt chapter became the new patrons of Quedlinburg on 14 April 1326. After Albert had fought a more prominent feud against the Margraviate of Meissen, the old conflict against the comital House of Regenstein broke out again. Albert accused the counts of various acts of violence and interference with his right and of converting churches into fortified buildings. The parties agreed to have the conflict arbitrated by Albert's brother, Duke Otto of Brunswick. However, after the duke gave his verdict, the counts disagreed, took up arms and damaged Quedlinburg Abbey and City. The struggle did not go well for the counts and they had to make several concessions to their opponents before Albert II was distracted by yet another conflict. After some machinations by cathedral dean Jacob Snelhard, the cathedral chapter closed an alliance with the three collegiate convents in town to protect their freedoms and privileges against all interventions. This alliance was primarily directed against Bishop Albert II. Albert's brother, Duke Otto of Brunswick, mediated and on 17 July 1336, a compromise was reached. Peace, however, did not last very long. Snelhard incited the citizens of Halberstadt against their bishop and they complained to his metropolitan, the Archbishop of Mainz, who sent master Albert of Gotha to investigate the complaints. After the investigation, the delegation from Mainz ruled against Snelhard and relieved him of his post. Although Albert II had excommunicated members of the collegiate chapter, they continued to exercise their clerical tasks. Albert II ordered that Halberstadt Cathedral and the Church of Our Lady be closed. A lower member of the clergy, who came to read Mass, was denied entrance. An insurgence broke out in the city. Delegates sent by the bishop were killed and Albert had to flee. The situation calmed down in 1338. Albert lifted the ex-communications and the written agreements between the citizens and the cathedral chapter were handed over and destroyed in the presence of a large number of prelates and knights. Albert returned and solemnly entered the city, accompanied by his Welf brothers and cousins as well as other spiritual and temporal leaders, and the citizens paid him homage again. In 1340, the feud between the Halberstadt convent and the Princes of Anhalt broke out again. The parties chose the Magdeburg archbishop, Otto of Hesse, as an arbitrator. He acknowledged that the Ascanian princes were entitled to Aschersleben and Emperor Louis IV enfeoffed Prince Bernhard III of Anhalt-Bernburg with the principality. Nevertheless, the Halberstadt convent retained possession of the Aschersleben estates. Another bloody feud arose after Giseko of Holstein died and the Pope appointed Count Albert of Mansfeld as the new Bishop of Halberstadt. In his struggle against Albert of Mansfeld, Albert II was supported by his brothers and by the cities of Brunswick, Halberstadt, Quedlinburg and Aschersleben. In the 1350s, there were further struggles with the pope. Pope Innocent VI tried every means available to dislodge Albert from his see. After Albert of Mansfeld died, the pope excommunicated Albert II and appointed the Wettin scion Louis of Meissen as his successor. Albert II resigned so that Louis could actually succeed him. On 13 May 1358, Albert sealed his resignation deed. He seems to have died later that year and was buried in Brunswick Cathedral.  References  * , in the series , printed by Leibnitz, vol.

History In the Middle Ages the Stubber was an island that became steadily smaller as a result of tree-felling and the excavation of stones. In 1678 the Stubber Bank acted as an assembly area for the entire naval force gathered for the invasion of R√ºgen which ended with the successful capture of Swedish-ruled island of R√ºgen by the Allies, Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark. In the 19th century, gravel was extracted for the construction of roads in Greifswald. The island first became awash in the first half of the 20th century. The large glacial erratics that remain to this day are a hazard for sports boats. The Stubber is marked with a shallow water buoy. Since 2004, the Gro√üer Stubber has been used by the Baltic grey seal (H. g. balticus) as a resting area, after this species had completely died out on the German Baltic Sea coast in 1930.

Born in 1838 to a humble farming family in New Orland, Maine, Ginn graduated from Tufts University in 1862. He then began work as a traveling textbook salesman. He eventually founded Ginn & Co., an educational publishing house distinguished for its commitment to innovation. By 1896, when Ginn moved his printing and publishing headquarters to the Athenaeum Building in Cambridge, MA, his company was one of the largest educational publishers in the country. Having gained commercial success, Ginn turned his considerable wealth and personal influence to supporting international peace efforts. His activities were part of an emerging international movement that believed in the possibility of perpetual peace; that is, that world peace could be definitively achieved. While not all were pacifists, many participants in the movement believed that advancing international commerce, democracy, rule of law, and diplomacy would provide the building blocks for a definitive era of global peace. Ginn also served on Tufts University‚Äôs Board of Overseers from 1898 until 1906, and as a trustee from 1907 until his death. Marrying his educational philosophy with his engagement on peace, Ginn launched the International School of Peace on July 12, 1910. By December 22 of that same year, Ginn‚Äôs vision shifted from a school to the World Peace Foundation whose existence was secured through his gift of an endowment.

The Society (also called Arti for short) has played a key role in the Netherlands art scene and in particular in the Amsterdam art schools. It was and is to this day a hub for artists and art lovers in the city of Amsterdam. It is a private institution which supports artists, maintains social networks and offers a pension fund. In recent times it has been one of the venues for the 17th edition of the Sonic Acts Festival. Arti et Amicitiae is also the name of the building. The complex was merged from two separate buildings and given a white neo-classical facade by J. H. Leliman in 1855.  History and Structure  Gable stone of the old Sint Lucas guild above the door of its former location, Waag, Amsterdam. In 1794 the last Dutch city painter's guild was dissolved during the French occupation by Napoleonic rule. The need for a common meeting place for artists became various clubs and drawing societies. In 1839 the Soci√´tait Arti et Amicitiae was founded. A year later the building \\"Grand Salon Dupond\\", located in the center of Amsterdam at the Rokin 3, was acquired at an auction. It became the home of this young society. Its aim was to address a distinguished audience and to promote interest in art. Initially it was called Arti et Amicitiae ‚Äì Soci√´tait ‚Äì Soci√©t√© des Beux on Rokin 3. Today it is called Maatschappij Arti et Amicitiae, or just \\"Arti\\". Today the house is assigned the number 112. In 1841 the new exhibition Salon was created according to plans by the architect Marinus van Elven Geradur Tetar on the first floor. He was professor and director of the architecture department at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam. To enhance this cooperative society of Fine Arts, in 1841 the King William II was given honorary membership. In 1880, the reestablishment of the St. Lucas Artist's Association took place in Amsterdam. This had nothing in common with the construction and alignment of the old guilds. Like other artist clubs, it was a meeting place, a place of training, and a meeting point of art lovers and collectors. However, it was unable to compete with the Soci√´teit Arti et Amicitiae because it was considered too academic. Added to this there was the problem of a lack of exhibition space. Of great importance were the art appreciation evenings. Art lovers (amateurs) and collectors gathered around the artist who showed photographs and lithographs.This type of printmaking became quite popular in the late 19th century.In 1820 a project was initiated by the Baron de Isidore Taylor with the name \\"Voyages pittoresques et dans l'ancienne France romantiques\\" to present historical monuments, gothic ruins and wild landscapes as lithography, which was very successful. The declared objective was to stimulate interest in the art, and then finally to improve the economic situation of the artist. This was new for artist societies. After the guilds had vanished as an economic instrument, this form of art promotion was the best alternative. For the members they created a widows and orphans fund along the lines of the old guilds funded by a portion of entrance fees for artists, the sale of exhibition catalogs and membership fees of the honorary members. Other income was generated from sales from the collection of the Historical Gallery. Arti et Amicitiae ‚Äì the politics Plan for exhibition space, 1841.Arti et Amicitiae: Neuer Ausstellungsraum aus dem Jahre 1841 nach Pl√§nen von dem Baumeister Marinus Geradur T√©tar van Elven. It was decided by Napoleon Bonaparte that the art world always had to be operated and determined by the rulers. In the Art Academy of Delft non-artists made art policy. The ranks of Sozi√´teit aimed to create an effective counter-movement. The aim has always been to guarantee the sovereignty of society ‚Äì which has been retained steadfastly to this day. This was, and still is today, above all the financial as an art policy. To increase the popularity of an advertising campaign for a statue of a very important son of the city ‚Äì Rembrandt van Rijn ‚Äì has been initiated. A founding member of Arti et Amiticae, Louis Royer, created this statue. In 1852 it was unveiled by King William III. One of the main concerns was the creation of a historical gallery with 103 works from scenes of national history. In 1841 the increase took place in the new exhibition room. The interesting effect was, a glass roof let sunlight into the elongated exhibition room. It was possible because the new steel construction allowed in the roof area a continuous band of windows. The shading effect has been achieved via an internal cornice. The vertical exhibit space was divided on pilasters.This vertical pillar-like shape element in architecture was gladly taken at that time. This is well recognized for its individually tailored art exhibitions. This is both to members and non-members. The latter include, inter alia, Marc Chagall, Vincent van Gogh and Max Liebermann. The company is called today about 550 artists and 1100 as members of her own sponsor. The very valuable and extensive historical library that was built up over the history of this association, has been delivered to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.Arti library on the website of the Van Gogh Museum ‚Äì The historical archives is still there. The Building The house of the Soci√´teit Arti et Amicitiae with the urban situation at Gracht Ronkin at the end of the 19th century The accommodation at the Rokin 3 have been maintained until today. The semi-detached house is characterized by the built-in cast-iron supports. The glass roof ensures a uniform illumination. Four allegories (Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Engraving) on the facade of \\"Arti et Amicitiae\\", Rokin, Amsterdam.Original wooden sculptures by Franz Strack√© in 1855 were taken inside for restoration (where they stayed) and these bronze sculptures were cast from the originals in 1989. The neo-classical facade has been accentuated by the four allegory building, sculpture, engraving and painting ‚Äì they are standing for the four in the house united art forms. These sculptures date back to Franz Stracke. In the facade are located a hand as a landmark and the ox, patron saint of the former guild of St. Lucas. The architect Hendrikus Petrus Berlage had taken the indoor design. Here showrooms, boardrooms and a private club room have been created. In 1893/94 the first rebuilding took place. The main entrance was moved to the Spui and the staircase and the hallway had been renewed. The architects Berlage and Beys, both members of the Artists' Association, distinguished themselves responsible for this construction project. In the years 1962‚Äì64 the building was completely restored and modernized. The main entrance was moved back to the Rokin. The exhibition rooms have been modernized. The precious woodwork of the interiors and the furniture works are still largely intact. In 2009, the adjacent building no. 114 was purchased in order to integrate new premises. In the precious staircase is a gallery of the great painters of the 2nd Golden Age of Dutch painting. These are such names as Lizzy Ansingh, George Hendrik Breitner, Marius Bauer, Bernd Blommers, the brothers Jacob Maris, Willem Maris and Matthijs Maris, Isaac Isra√´ls, Jozef Israels, Lourens Alma Tadema, Hendrik Willem Mesdag, Jan Sluijters, Jan Toorop, Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch, Willem Witsen, Coba Ritsema and Kees Marks. Willink van Collenprijs In 1878 Wilhelm Ferdinand Willink van Collen had decreed in his will. An amount of 30,000 guilders was to support the Soci√´teit Arti et Amicitiae. He had the task of promoting the young Dutch artists during their study phase through a stipend.Van Collen (1847‚Äì1878) was a painter and beyond as he and his wife Anna van Bosse were art lovers. From 1880 the Willink van Collenprijs was awarded with interruptions until 1950. First Arti had oriented to the tiered pricing of Paris Salon.The French Salon has five levels: Admission to the exhibition is connected with the possibility of a gold medal, silver medal. Then there was the commendation and finally the mention of participation. From 1890 only one 1st prize was awarded to the new regulation. In 1897, 1909 and 1910 and in 1917 it was awarded several times. In Amsterdam this idea of support for artists had fallen on fertile soil. This can be seen in its long duration and the recognition of a number of award winners up to the present time in 1950. Prize of Soci√´tait Arti et Amicitiae In addition to the aforementioned prize, a separate prize for artist was awarded by the Soci√´tait yet. This was also highly sought after. In the Netherlands there was the art exhibition of living artists, which took place in the two- to three-year intervals. Thus, the young artist had three ways to make a name and to make known their art in this way.

He is the co-host of \\"Len Berman and Michael Riedel in the Morning\\" on 710 WOR in New York City, weekdays 6-10am. Riedel has been a controversial and influential Broadway columnist of the New York Post for over 20 years. Riedel's book Razzle Dazzle: The Battle for Broadway won the 2015 Marfield Prize for arts writing and is widely considered to be the successor to The Season, William Goldman's classic 1967 book about Broadway. His next book, \\"Singular Sensation: The Triumph of Broadway,\\" will be published by Avid Reader Press, a division of Simon & Schuster, on November 10, 2020. Riedel's skewering of Broadway shows and personalities in his column have made him a controversial and often feared figure on the New York theater scene. He has been called \\"the enfant terrible of the New York press\\". Early life and education Riedel was born on December 24, 1966, and grew up in Geneseo, New York. His father was the athletic director for SUNY Geneseo and his mother was a grade-school librarian. He has been described as a \\"smart, sarcastic kid\\" who joined the Young Republicans at 12 and originally planned to become a lawyer and politician. He initially enrolled at Johns Hopkins University, but transferred after a year to Columbia University. While at Columbia, he acted in plays and regularly appeared on a radio show devoted to musical theater. The summer after his sophomore year, he interned for Liz McCann while she was producing the Broadway production of Les liaisons dangereuses. In 1989, he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in History. Career After graduating from Columbia, Riedel served as Managing Editor of the now- defunct TheaterWeek magazine, which he attempted to make more literary by hiring highly respected theater figures such as critic Eric Bentley to write articles. In 1993, he was hired as a gossip columnist for The Daily News and subsequently launched his now-famous column reporting the latest news and speculation about the Broadway theater scene. In 1998, he moved his column to the New York Post, where he remains today. In September 2015, the Post announced that it was cutting the column from two columns a week to one. Riedel said of the change: \\"I'm happy about the changes. It's all part of a redesign of the features pages. If there's any 'breaking news,' I'll get it on the website and in the paper the next day.\\"Viagas, Robert. \\"Controversial Columnist Michael Riedel Says He's \\"Happy\\" With Changes at NY Post\\" Playbill, September 30, 2015 Riedel's Wednesday column was reinstated in the paper in 2016 after advertisers complained of its absence. David Leveaux controversy In 2005, Riedel was the subject of considerable press himself when he was in an altercation with English director David Leveaux at the Manhattan theater hangout Angus McIndoe. Riedel, who later admitted to being \\"tipsy,\\" insulted Leveaux by claiming that English directors often ruin classic American musicals. While rumors circulated that Leveaux hit Riedel so hard that the columnist had to go to the emergency room, the truth is that Riedel was merely shoved to the floor and was not injured. Cultural references Riedel also appeared regularly on the \\"Imus in the Morning\\" program, \\"The Mark Simone Show\\", \\"The Mike Gallagher Show\\" and Fox News', \\"Red Eye\\". Riedel played a version of himself in several episodes of the NBC musical drama Smash. In view of his notorious reputation as a theater columnist, Riedel was referred to as a \\"Napoleonic little Nazi\\" in the premiere episode of the on February 6, 2012. He later made cameo appearances in three episodes: *\\"Hell on Earth\\" *\\"The Fallout\\" *\\"The Nominations\\" In 2016, Riedel appeared on John Mulaney and Nick Kroll's comedy show Oh, Hello on Broadway. Riedel was mentioned in the opening song at the 71st Tony Awards performed by host Kevin Spacey.

She was named \\"best kuduro artist of 2011\\". Career Titicia's popularity stems from the artist's ability to fuse different styles into her ability and embracing her uniqueness in the Angolan music industry. Her stage name is Portuguese for worthless or useless; she chose that stage name to reclaim the hateful words that people have thrown at her as a trans woman. Her success in the industry combats the homophobic and transphobic sentiments that exist in Angola and globally. She combines her training in ballet with traditional kuduro dance styles to portray a unique and personalized brand of femininity and control over her body.Young, Hershini. ‚Äú‚ÄòSound of Kuduro Knocking at My Door‚Äô: Kuduro Dance and the Poetics of Debility.‚Äù African American Review, vol. 45, no. 3, 2012, pp. 391‚Äì402., doi:10.1353/afa.2012.0037. =Early career= Born Teca Miguel Garcia in Luanda, Titica began her career as a back-up dancer with acts such as Noite & Dia, Propria Lixa and Puto Portugues. Her first recording of a single was unplanned. She had only been intending to help Noite & Dia with inspiration to develop a chorus for a track, and the studio session resulted in recording Titica's voice for the track. This experience began Titica's music-recording career. A year later, in October 2011, she recorded ‚ÄúCh√£o‚Äù and became an international success, particularly within Angola and the Angolan diaspora. =Influences= Titica is very public about her Congolese background and the influence that this has on her music. In her Red Bull Music Academy lecture in Berlin 2018, she discusses some of her influences: ‚ÄúI have a Congolese background. I listened to lots of music from Congo. P√©p√© Kall√© [and] Koffi Olomide, who inspired me a lot.‚Äù She further states that her music combines kuduro with the Congolese genres Kall√© and N‚Äôdombolo. Another source of Titica's inspiration is female kuduro artist Fofand√≥. Titica discusses this influence in the same Red Bull Music Academy lecture, ‚ÄúOne of the most important female artists in the kuduro scene was Fofand√≥, who is the queen of kuduro. You hear around the world, in Brazil they say that I‚Äôm the queen of kuduro, but kuduro has a queen who inspired us and I looked up to.‚Äù =Activism and Advocacy= In 2013, she was named a goodwill ambassador for UNAIDS. Through this role and her international popularity, Titica has increased awareness of HIV risks and treatment, sexual health, and issues regarding the LGBT community. In her statement with UNAIDS, Titica shares, \\"I have been beaten and stoned for who I am. I have suffered so much humiliation but I am ready to lead by example and help overcome stigma and discrimination in my country and beyond.\\" In addition to her platform as an internationally acclaimed public figure, Titica spreads awareness about these issues through the lyrics of her music. In her 2012 collaboration with popular Angolan singer Ary, ‚ÄúOhla O Boneca‚Äù, Titica makes ‚Äúa bold stand for equal love.‚Äù BBC also reports that her 2016 release ‚ÄúAbaixa‚Äù featuring DJ Jo√£o Linho ‚Äúbecame an anthem for how to fight homophobia in Angola‚Äù. =International Performances= Titica performed in Brazil in 2017. where she released her song, \\"Capim Guin√©\\" with the group BaianaSystem in Rio de Janeiro.

In Portugal and Brazil the song has stayed in first place on the music charts for 3 weeks in Portuguese program TOP + and 7 weeks in Brazilian show Rolando M√∫sica. \\"Olha o Boneco\\", had a lot of success in discos, and TV shows in the PALOP (African countries whose official language is Portuguese) and some European countries. Titica in this song wants to give a message to the sexuality of some people in a few sentences she makes her meaning ¬´outrora fui bailarina, agora sou √† menina¬ª and when Ary sings ¬´venho de forma diferente, e quem quiser que comente... bem ou mal √© de mim, porque est√£o falando assim¬ª; that we are all different but all human, all equal, just \\"one love\\". The second song of O Ch√£o's album is \\"Ablua\\", recorded in Angola. The third single is known as \\"Ch√£o Ch√£o\\" and is included on the bonus track album.

It joins the peninsulas of Jasmund and Wittow. Washed up and shaped by the sea, it forms a sickle-shaped shoreline on the bay of Tromper Wiek and separates the lagoons of the Gro√üer Jasmunder Bodden and Breeger Bodden from the Baltic. The fine, washed up sand forms a giant natural bathing bay, that is bordered by the villages of Glowe and Juliusruh (a village in the municipality of Breege). Unlike the second largest bar on the island of R√ºgen, the Schmale Heide between Jasmund and the Granitz, which is dominated by the construction of the former Nazi \\"Strength Through Joy\\" resort of Prora and decades of military use and its associated infrastructure, the Schaabe between Glowe and Juliusruh is undeveloped apart from a managed forest, the only through road and its accompanying cycle path.  Formation  The Schaabe began to form about 4,500 years ago, when R√ºgen was still an island archipelago. Only the island cores, especially Wittow and Jasmund jutted out from the sea. As a result of the power of waves combined with a sustained uplift, the coasts of these island cores were gradually eroded and the sediment, carried by ocean currents, was deposited to form spits. This process continues today. From archaeological finds it is known that the southern part of the Schaabe in the area of the present day Glowe first silted up at the time of the early Slavic settlements, that is in the 7th or 8th centuries. This also meant that sailors from the then major Slavic settlement near the present-day Ralswiek - at the transition between the Gro√üer and Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden lagoons - had a much shorter access route to the open sea. Similar to the flint fields in the northern part of the Schmale Heide, but much smaller in size, are ridges of flint at many places in the northern part of Schaabe behind the main line of sand dunes, which were thrown up here by the waves in earlier times, when the sea level was higher. This proves that the erosion and transportation of flints from the chalk cliffs of Wittow and Jasmund has reduced over the centuries and been replaced by the deposition of fine beach sand.  Today  Behind the wide white beach a ten-kilometre-long and up to seven-metre-high coastal defence dune barrier protects the hinterland from storm floods. The dunes are stabilised by the painstaking planting of beach grass (Ammophila arenaria), which counteracts erosion by wind and waves and promotes height growth. Behind the main dunes is an area of low, hummocky dunes (one to five metres above NN), which were planted in 1866, 1881, 1901, 1952 and most recently in 1957 with pine (European Black Pine), Birch, Sessile oak and English oak. Generalplan K√ºsten- und Hochwasserschutz Mecklenburg-Vorpommern auf This coastal protection forest has an area of 168 hectares and extends southwest to the shore of the lagoon. Before it was afforested, the Schaabe had been known for centuries as the Schmale Wittower Heide (\\"Narrow Wittow Heath\\"). Due to the different soil moisture on the wiek (bay) and bodden (lagoon) sides of the Schaabe the vegetation is different on each side.

The coalition forces in Afghanistan maintain the Joint Prioritized Effects List (JPEL) of targets their special forces try to capture or kill. Using night vision equipment US special forces would burst into civilian households where targets on the Joint Prioritized Effects List were believed to be found. The operations are controversial, due to issues like civilian casualties. Controversy American generals have argued that these raids are a \\"critical\\" part of achieving success in the war. Afghan president Hamid Karzai has argued that they impinge upon Afghanistan's sovereignty and has called for them to be halted. Human rights workers were concerned that the raids killed a large number of civilians bystanders, who weren't on the list. In addition they were concerned that individuals ended up on the list due to weak circumstantial evidence, or false denunciations triggered by greed, or long- standing tribal rivalries. Afghan journalist Anand Gopal described a night raid intended to capture an official of the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture who had been denounced. He wasn't home, but during the course of the raid two of his cousins who also lived in his family compound were killed, and a third cousin was seized and disappeared into US custody. Hamid Karzai's cousin Haji Yar Mohammad was killed during a night raid on his house in March 2011. Officials on the Afghanistan High Peace Council reacted with anger when former Guantanamo captive Sabar Lal Melma who they thought had already been cleared of suspicion, was killed during a night raid. Saber Melma had been subjected to repeated raids and seizures. Officials on the Commission thought they had been assured by senior US officials that US Special Forces were going to stop harassing Melma. Yet he was shot during a further raid in September 2011. In April 2012, the United States and Afghan governments signed an agreement which specifies that all future night raids will be approved by the Afghan government and led by Afghan units. It is expected that the raids will continue, and be dominated by US forces due to a shortage of Afghan special forces units; prior to the agreement Afghan forces were involved in 97 percent of all night raids, but only led approximately 40 percent of these operations. In April 2012, Abdul Salam Zaeff, another former Guantanamo captive, who had served as the Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan, fled Afghanistan because he feared US raids. On April 9, 2012, Al Jazeera reported that Zaeef left Afghanistan for the United Arab Emirates. Al Jazeera wrote \\"Zaeef feared for his life in the wake of the attempted raids on his home. Many of the Taliban prisoners freed from Guantanamo had been killed in night raids and that made Zaeef more nervous.\\" The Drug Enforcement Administration has acknowledged its role in submitting names of individual who would then be subject to night raids. The DEA is the lead agency in the Afghan Threat Finance Cell‚Äîan organization that tracked suspicious financial transactions. Afghan president Karzai largely banned night raids from 2013. His successor Ashraf Ghani lifted this ban from November 2014. The operations will be conducted by Afghan forces with occasional assistance from American advisers.

Day was born in 1810 to Erastus and Lucy Day in Otsego County, New York. Erastus and Lucy Day moved to Macomb County, Michigan in 1826, leaving John in New York. In 1836, John Day purchased this property and began farming. In 1837 he married Polly Parkhurst; the couple has six children, four of whom lived to adulthood. In 1863, Day built this house. In 1879, the Day family sold the house to Prussian immigrant Augustus Dittman and his wife Maria Kohler. August died in 1898 and Maria in 1901, after which the house went to their son William. William live dthere and farmed the property until his death in 1956. The house remained in his family until 1970 until it was sold once again. Description Built in 1863 in the style of Greek Revival architecture, the structure is a wood framed, two-story house with a portico, pediment, and rounded latticework linking the four hexagonal columns of the portico. A 1¬Ω-story addition was built along the entire right side of the house in 1880, extending the length of the structure and adding a large room. Since then, the structure has remained largely intact, except for an arcade and porch added to the back in 1974. The house is clad with Flush-board siding, and has a center door with molded enframement. A recessed porch on the ell contains a secondary entrance door.

The federal government is in charge of water resources management; state governments have the primary responsibility for urban water supply; and local governments together with communities are responsible for rural water supply. The responsibility for sanitation is not clearly defined. Water supply service quality and cost recovery are low. Water tariffs are low and many water users do not pay their bills. Service providers thus rely mostly on occasional subsidies to cover their operating costs. Access In 2015, 67% of the total population had access to \\"at least basic water supply\\".WASHwatch [url=https://washwatch.org/en/countries/nigeria/summary/statistics/]JMP [url=https://washdata.org/] This was 82% of the urban population and 54% of the rural population. In 2015, around 60 million people lacked access to \\"at least basic\\" water. As for sanitation, only 33% of the total population had access to \\"at least basic\\" sanitation. This was 39% of the urban population and 27% of the rural population. Approximately 122 million people still lacked access to \\"at least basic\\" sanitation.WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation In urban areas, access to standpipes substituted to a large extent to piped water access. Adequate sanitation is typically in the form of septic tanks, as there is no central sewerage system, except for Abuja and some areas of Lagos.USAID: Nigeria Water and Sanitation Profile, ca. 2007 A 2006 study estimated that only 1% of Lagos households were connected to sewers.Matthew Gandy:Water, Sanitation, and the Modern City: Colonial and post-colonial experiences in Lagos and Mumbai, , Human Development Report Office Occasional Paper, 2006 Lagos has four wastewater treatment plants which have been rehabilitated around 2010. As of 2011, the state planned to build ten new \\"mega wastewater treatment plants\\" over the next five years with the help of private investors. These have not yet been completed. The statistics on access to water and sanitation are conflicting, due to divergent definitions, indicators and methodologies applied by different agencies. There is hardly any sector monitoring.John Gambo Laah, Ph.D., Water and Sanitation Monitoring Platform (WSMP), Nigeria: Nigeria Water and Sanitation Summary Sheet, no date According to a report published by Amnesty International in September, there oil company Shell and government of Rivers State, in southern Nigeria are not doing enough to provide clean water in Ogale, an area outside of the state capital. Residents are either forced to buy water at unaffordable prices or drink from wells contaminated with benzene. Service quality According to the World Bank, in 2010 water production facilities in Nigeria were ‚Äúrarely operated to capacity due to broken down equipment, or lack of power or fuel for pumping.‚Äù The operating cost of water agencies is increased by the need to rely on diesel generators or even having to build their own power plants, since power supply is erratic. Equipment and pipes are poorly maintained, leading to intermittent supply and high levels of non-revenue water. As of 2000, about 80% of all government- owned water systems in small towns were non-operational. Through investments and capacity building for communities, the functionality of water points can be increased in the short term. For example, in focus communities supported by UNICEF in Kwara State, functionality has improved from 53% to 98%, and in Kebbi State the functionality of boreholes has improved from 12% to 88%. However, it is not clear how well these facilities will continue to function in the long term, after international intervention has ended. This raises legitimate questions about whether de-colonization of Nigeria, like other African countries, was actually in the best interests of the native peoples themselves. Efficiency Water supply and sanitation are not provided efficiently in Nigeria. For example, State Water Agencies are massively overstaffed. In 2000, there were about 70 staff per 1,000 customers in State Water Agencies, compared to a best practice ratio of 3.5. Non-revenue water often exceeds 50 percent. Water supply by cities =Abuja= Millennium Park in Abuja, whose water supply is being expanded. Nigeria's capital Abuja receives part of its drinking water from the lower Usuma dam. The capacity of the plant that treats surface water from the dam's reservoir was in the process of being increased in 2012 in order to cater for the growing population of the capital. The Guara dam, which was under construction in 2012, is expected to further increase water supply to Abuja and to mitigate against the risk of drought. Wastewater is treated in a 131,200 cubic meters per day plant at Wupa that was completed in 2007. The Federal Capital Territory, through the Abuja Environmental Protection Board, has contracted a private operator to run the plant. However, when the government apparently failed to pay the operator he walked away, confronting the area with a pollution crisis.OOSKAnews:Abuja Faces Wastewater Challenge After Treatment Plant Contractor Walks Off, 19 October 2012 = Enugu = =Lagos= Nigeria's largest city Lagos is surrounded by water from the sea and a lagoon. Its clean water supply in the city is about 81.32%. But since the raw water in the lagoon is too polluted, the city gets its water from the Ogun and Owo rivers. The city's oldest water treatment plant, located in Iju on the Ogun River, was built in 1910. It was expanded in stages to 45m gallons per day. Another smaller plant was built at Ishashi on the Owo River in the 1970s. The biggest plant so far was commissioned in 1991 in Adiyan with a capacity of 70m gallons per day. It also draws from the Owo River. There are also seven mini- waterworks drawing from local sources with a combined capacity of 18m gallons per day. The Lagos Water Corporation states that the water produced in the plant meets the highest standards, and that it supplies \\"safe drinking water in sufficient and regular quantity to over 12.5 million people in Lagos State\\". However, water is often contaminated in the distribution network and people distrust tap water quality. Electricity supply interruptions prevent treatment plants from operating continuously. However, a dedicated 12.15 MW power plant was under construction in 2012 to supply power to the Adiyan, Iju and Akute water treatment plants. Households also source water from numerous private shallow wells. Or households rely on street vendors, creating a thriving market for ‚Äúsachet water‚Äù, purified water packaged in polyethylene pouches. Water vendors called Mairuwa sell water from tanks and drums on carts, which is sometimes sold to other vendors that carry water in buckets or gerry cans. Access to water provided by the state Water Corporation is 'metropocentric' i.e., centred around the metropolis. Kunnuji, Michael O. N. (2014). Spatial variations in access to improved sanitation and water in Lagos state. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(4), 612 ‚Äì 619. =Makurdi= In Makurdi, the capital of Benue State, only about 25-30% of the population are served and inhabitants fetch raw water in buckets from the polluted Benue river. In 2008 the construction of a water treatment plant was left unfinished and officials were unable to account for US$6 million. As of 2012, a water treatment plant was under construction as part of the Greater Makurdi Waterworks Project. According to Nat Apir, an independent water consultant, the lack of a modern distribution network will lead pipes to burst and the capacity of the plant is at risk of not being fully utilized. =Other cities= The Northern city of Kano suffers from deficient water supply. Kano is supplied from local rivers and from groundwater which is over-exploited. Public water supply is deficient, so that private water selling points are multiplying and generate profits for their private operators. Kaduna receives drinking water from the Kaduna River. Ibadan receives its drinking water from the Eleyele dam. National policies and initiatives Nigeria's National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy, approved in 2000, encourages private- sector participation and envisages institutional and policy reforms at the state level. However, little has happened in both respects. As of 2007, only four of the 37 states ‚Äì Lagos, Cross River, Kaduna and Ogun States ‚Äì began to introduce public-private partnerships (PPP) in the form of service contracts, a form of PPP where the responsibility of the private sector is limited to operating infrastructure without performance incentives. While the government has a decentralization policy, little actual decentralization has happened. The capacity of local governments to plan and carry out investments, or to operate and maintain systems, remains low despite efforts at capacity development. Furthermore, the national policy focuses on water supply and neglects sanitation. In 2003 a \\"Presidential Water Initiative (PWI): Water for People, Water for Life\\" was launched by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo. The initiative had ambitious targets to increase access, including a 100 percent water access target in state capitals, 75 percent access in other urban areas, and 66 percent access in rural areas. Little has been done to implement the initiative and targets have not been met. In 2011 the government voted in the United Nations in favor of a resolution making water and sanitation a human right. However, it has not passed legislation to enshrine the human right to water and sanitation in national law. The country is not on track to reach the Millennium Development Goal for water and sanitation. Since 2008 community-led total sanitation has been introduced in six states, with the support of UNICEF and the EU. While not being a national policy, apparently this grass-roots initiative has met with some success. More than 17,000 latrines have been built in 836 communities, and more than 100 of these communities have attained the goal of being declared free of open defecation.Greg Marinovich:Community- led water and sanitation projects take root in Nigeria, UNICEF, 23 September 2010 Responsibilities Three levels of government share responsibility for the delivery of water supply services. The responsibility for sanitation is not always clear, but urban sanitation is a responsibility of state governments. =Federal Government= The Federal Ministry of Water Resources, which had been part of the Ministry of Agriculture for a period until 2010, is responsible for large water resources development projects and water allocation between states. There are 12 River Basin Development Authorities under the Ministry, responsible for planning and developing water resources, irrigation work and the collection of hydrological, hydro-geological data. They also provide water in bulk to cities from dams. A Utilities Charges Commission was established in 1992 to monitor and regulate utility tariffs, including those of State Water Agencies.World Bank/Federal Republic of Nigeria:Water Supply & Sanitation Interim Strategy Note, November 2000, retrieved on April 11, 2012 =State Governments= Responsibility for potable water supply is entrusted to State Water Agencies (SWAs) or state water departments in the 36 Nigerian states. The SWAs are responsible to their state governments, generally through a State Ministry of Water Resources. SWAs are responsible for urban water supply, and in some states also for rural water supply. As of 2000, 22 states had separate state rural water and sanitation agencies, mostly set up to implement a UNICEF program. In 2010, Lagos state set up a State Wastewater Management Office under the Lagos State Water Corporation. It took the responsibility for sanitation over from the State Ministry of Environment. =Local Governments= The Local Government Authorities (LGAs), of which there are 774, are responsible for the provision of rural water supplies and sanitation facilities in their areas although only a few have the resources and skills to address the problem. Only few LGAs have rural water supply divisions. =Communities= In some communities in rural areas, water and sanitation committees (WASCOs) have been formed to operate and maintain water facilities. These committees are supposed to collect their own water tariffs. Donors such as the African Development Bank have set a requirement that at least 30% of members of WASCOs must be women. In 1993 the Government committed itself to strengthen community participation in rural water supply in a policy document. As of 2000, the policy had not been disseminated or implemented in all government- or donor-financed programs. =Civil society= Nigeria's Water and Sanitation sector has a vibrant and dynamic civil society implementing several initiatives to address sectoral crisis. The Society for Water and Sanitation (NEWSAN) is the umbrella network of WASH NGOs, while the Water and Sanitation Media Network www.wash-jn.net comprises Journalists reporting the sector. A leading non governmental organisation in the sector is Bread of Life Development Foundation which manages the eWASH webblog www.assemblyonline.info on water and sanitation news in Nigeria.eWASH , retrieved on April 17. 2013 Financial aspects = Tariffs and cost recovery = Flat rates for unmetered connections. Most Nigerian water supply connections are not metered. The metering ratio varies from 7% in Katsina to 16% in Kaduna and 24% in Lagos in 2007. Unmetered customers are charged a flat rate independent of consumption. For unmetered residential customers the monthly flat rate was US$3 in Lagos, US$5 in Katsina and US$11 in Kaduna. In Yobe state it was only Naira 100 (US$0.60) per month, the lowest level in the country according to the Yobe State Water Corporation. The tariff revenues covered only 2% of the costs of supplying water. Tariffs for metered connections. Metered customers are either charged a linear tariff, as it is the case in Lagos, or an increasing-block tariff, as it is the case in Katsina and Kaduna. Under the increasing-block tariff, the tariff per cubic meter increases stepwise with consumption beginning at a consumption of 30m3 per month with a total of 3 to 6 blocks. The residential tariff for the first block of consumption is US$0.19 per m3 in Kaduna and US$0.44 per m3 in Katsina. Tariffs for commercial and industrial users are higher. The average water tariff for metered customers was Naira 50 per m3 (US$0.30) in Oyo state and Naira 16 per m3 (US$0.10) in Taraba state in 2009. Tariff collection. Outdated information systems and inconsistent billing practices cause additional revenue losses. The revenue collection rate is very low. In some areas it is less than 10% of billed amounts. There are significant arrears, particularly from government agencies. Tariff adjustments. Each state sets its own water tariff. Tariff adjustments need to be approved by the State Executive Council through a lengthy procedure. Being unable to cover their operating costs, and unable to secure regular revisions of the tariff, the State Water Agencies receive financial assistance from the state governments. Vendor prices. Surveys of street vendors in Lagos, Kaduna and Katsina show that they charge as much as 20 times more than the State Water Agencies. The amount paid, for a very limited volume of supply from private water vendors, can be four to ten times that of one month's much larger volume of tap supply. =Investment= For Nigeria to meet the Millennium Development Goal for water supply by 2015, the country needs to invest approximately N215 billion (US$1.3 billion) annually. Nigeria is currently investing not more than N82.5 billion (US$0.5 billion) into the sector.Benson Ajisegiri, National Project Coordinator of the World Bank-Assisted National Urban Water Sector Reform Project:\\"Nigeria needs N215b annually to develop water infrastructure\\", Daily Times, 28 March 2011 Much of these investments are needed to rehabilitate infrastructure that has not been properly maintained. It is not clear if the estimate includes sanitation or not. = Financing = While all three government levels are supposed to participate in financing water and sanitation investments, local governments often do not have the resources to do so. State and federal levels also provide only limited funding. Thus, most public water and sanitation investments in Nigeria are financed by donors.WaterAid Nigeria:Sector finance and investments, retrieved on April 11, 2011 The sharing of oil and tax revenues between different levels of government is a politically sensitive issue in Nigeria, which is divided between a Muslim North and a mostly Christian South and where one region in the South accounts for all oil revenues. Between 1948 and 2001, nine commissions, six military decrees, one Act of the legislature and two Supreme Court judgements have attempted to define fiscal interrelationships among the component parts of the federation without resolving the issue.Peter Ozo-Eson: Fiscal Federalism: Theory, Issues And Perspectives, Daily Independent,29 August 2005 Federal revenues include about 90 percent of government revenues, including oil royalties and import duties. These are pooled with the more limited state and local revenues, and the pooled resources are then shared by the three levels of government according to an agreed formula. After independence the federal government received 40% of revenues and the states 60%, an arrangement that would benefit the oil-producing region in the Niger Delta. Local governments had no share. After the Biafra War the share of federal government was increased to 80% in 1968, but was subsequently decreased again. Since the 1976 Local Government Reform, local government receives its own share of revenues. As of 1999, the share of local government was 20%, the state share was 24% and the share of the federal government and for special projects was 56%.Akindele S.T and Olaopa : Fiscal federalism and local Government finance in Nigeria, 2002  External cooperation  The most important external partners in the Nigerian water supply and sanitation sector are the African Development Bank, the European Union, Japanese JICA, UNICEF, USAID, the NGO WaterAid, Action Against Hunger (NGO) and the World Bank. The African Development Bank and the World Bank provide loans to the government; the European Union, JICA and USAID provide grants to the government; UNICEF and WaterAid receive grants from governments and donations from the public to implement their projects in cooperation with, but not through the government. = African Development Bank = In February 2012 the African Development Bank approved a US$100 million soft loan to improve water and sanitation in the northern city of Zaria. The project will be implemented by the Kaduna State Water Board.AfDB makes USD 100m loan for better water and sanitation in Nigeria, 16 February 2012 It also approved an Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project in the cities of Ibadan and Jalingo in Oyo and Taraba States in 2009. Both urban projects include the installation of water meters, hygiene promotion as well as the construction of toilets at schools, health clinics, market places and parks. Unlike the newer project in Zaria, the older project supports reforms at the state level to separate regulatory from operational functions, and the introduction of public-private partnerships.African Development Bank:The African Development Bank in Action. Activities in the Water and Sanitation Sector in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, February 2012, retrieved on April 11, 2012 The AfDB also finances a Rural Water and Sanitation projects in Yobe and Osun States approved in 2007. The project aimed to increase the functionality of rural water supply and sanitation facilities in the two states, estimated to be below 50% in 2006, to 100% in 2012. The sanitation facilities built are sanplat latrines and Ventilated Improved Pit Latrines. The AfDB finances the entire costs of these projects without requiring a contribution by the Nigerian state. The AfDB has invested US$905 million in the sector since 1971. = China = In 2005 China signed a grant agreement with Nigeria to drill 598 boreholes in 18 states and the FCT.Forum on China-Africa Cooperation: China and Nigeria Sign Water Supply Project Agreement, 19 October 2005 The amount of the grant and the implementing agency were not specified. = European Union = The EU supports a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Reform Programme in six states (Anambra, Cross River, Jigawa, Kano, Osun and Yobe) with 87 million Euros grant funding. The Nigerian state, at all three levels of government, and local communities are expected to contribute another 31 million Euros.Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Reform Programme, retrieved on April 11, 2012 = JICA = JICA provides grants for rural water supply and sanitation in three states, Oyo, Kano and Yobe.JICA: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation in Nigeria, retrieved on April 11, 2012 = UNICEF = UNICEF has supported rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene in communities and schools across the country since 2002. Its interventions have been financed by DFID and the European Commission. A total of 6,960 new safe water sources (boreholes, dug wells and protected springs) and over 19,100 household latrines have been constructed. Over 400 schools have been provided with latrines with separate provision for boys and girls and hand washing facilities,UNICEF:Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Nigeria, February 2007 = USAID = USAID supports rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene education in Northern Nigeria, in 46 communities in Bauchi, Kano and Sokoto States.

It works closely with Nigerian NGOs, including the Benue NGO Network (BENGONET), Society for Water and Sanitation in Nigeria (NEWSAN), Justice Development and Peace Initiative (JDPI), Community Based Development ‚Äì NGO (CBD-NGO), Women Empowerment In Nigeria (WEIN) and the Bol Development Association (BOLDA). It works in over 100 communities in the states of Bauchi, Benue and Plateau. It has developed a vulnerability ranking, based on criteria suggested by communities themselves, to help communities in selecting themselves where resources should be allocated. Such a participatory and transparent decision- making process is of particular importance in a context of low trust and poor governance.WaterAid Nigeria:Where we work, retrieved on April 11, 2012 In January 2012 it has been tasked by the government with the task of facilitating monitoring and evaluation of government water, sanitation and hygiene projects in Nigeria. According to the Minister of Water Resources, President Goodluck Jonathan is interested in an independent assessment of sector performance and NGOs are well placed to undertake this task.WaterAid Nigeria: Federal Government tasks WaterAid in Nigeria to lead monitoring and evaluation of WASH projects, 17 January 2012 = World Bank = The World Bank has completed seven water projects since 1985 and had three on-going projects in 2010. Total investment for the 10 projects is about US$1.4 billion. The First Urban Water Reform Project (US$120 million) targets 13 towns in the states of Kaduna, Ogun and Enugu. The project also aims to establish state water policies, and to foster the engagement with the private sector. The second Urban Water Reform Project worth US$200 million, supports the extension of the piped network in Calabar, and the rehabilitation of water treatment plants and distribution systems in Lagos as well as another three towns in Cross River State. Under a Privatization Project, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Water Board is being assisted with US$25 million.World Bank:New Project to Bring Clean Water to 50,000 Households, 22 April 2010 In 2012 the World Bank approved a US$400 million National Urban Water Sector Reform Project for Lagos, Kaduna, Ogun, Enugu and Cross River States.

It was to be used by the RCAF 39th Reconnaissance Wing. Unfortunately, the land selected for the airfield was quite muddy in the rain and laying down Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) had little effect and it was quickly abandoned. The only known use of the airfield was by a USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress that made an emergency landing on 25 November 1944. The plane was so damaged by combat and the landing it was written off and remained at the airfield. It was scavenged by the local populace and slowly dismantled over time. The land was returned to local farmers after the war, ending its military use and was returned to agriculture. References * Blakenberg (B-66) * Johnson, David C.

Early life The son of Thomas Dodd, a tailor, he was born in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields, London, on 7 July 1771. When he was ten years old his father left home, and he was taken from school at Shooter's Hill. His first employment was in the service of an Anglo-American colonel named De Vaux, an eccentric adventurer: he was taken about the country as a member of his band of juvenile musicians. After a time the colonel left him with a butcher; he ran away in quest of the colonel, going penniless on foot from London to Liverpool, and from there to Matlock Bath. At another time Dodd was left with an itinerant harper at Conway. Harsh treatment induced him to seek the protection of a Welsh innkeeper; then he lived a while with a sporting parson, ultimately returning to London in 1788, and taking a menial position in the shop of his uncle, a tailor named Tooley, in Bucklersbury. His next place was as a footman. In 1794 he married his employer's waiting-maid, and opened a day-school near Battle Bridge, St. Pancras. He gave up his school to accept a situation as engrossing clerk in the enrolment office of the court of chancery. Printseller In 1796 Dodd took a small shop in Lambeth Marsh for the sale of old books and prints. Two years later he moved to Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. His dealings in prints gradually extended, and his stock assumed large proportions. In 1806 he opened an auctionroom in St Martin's Lane, and there he sold some famous collections, among them being that of General Dowdeswell in January 1809. In the course of his business he had large sales of prints and books at Liverpool, Portsmouth, and elsewhere. When he was at Ludlow in 1812, he found in the possession of an innkeeper a copy of Henry Holland's Basioloogia (1618), but it was not till seven years later that he was able to buy it. Good fortune deserted him and his stock dwindled. He settled in Manchester about 1819 as an auctioneer, and in 1823 projected a scheme which led to the establishment of the Royal Manchester Institution in Mosley Street, and the holding of annual exhibitions of pictures. Returning to London he had a sale-room for two years in Leicester Street, Leicester Square, and then became for several years foreman for Martin Colnaghi; from whose establishment he was engaged by the Earl of Yarborough to arrange and complete his collection of prints. In 1844, a widower, he was elected a brother of the Charterhouse. Dodd died on 17 August 1850 at the residence of Joseph Mayer near Liverpool. He was buried in St James Cemetery, Liverpool. Works Dodd acquired a wide knowledge of engravings, and began an elaborate biographical catalogue of engravers, which eventually formed thirty folio volumes of manuscript. In 1817 Dodd spent time on a dictionary of monograms, but a similar work by Brulliot was published about that time. Before leaving Manchester at the end of 1825 he began to publish his work entitled The Connoisseur's Repertorium; or a Universal Historical Record of Painters, Engravers, Sculptors, and Architects, and of their Works, &c.; The first two volumes were published in 1825, and the work was continued to the name \\"Barraducio\\" in a sixth volume, issued in 1831, when lack of support compelled the author to abandon it. In 1839‚Äì41 Dodd made a catalogue, which remained in manuscript, of the Douce collection of fifty thousand prints in the Bodleian Library. He also arranged and catalogued Horace Walpole's prints, which were sold by George Henry Robins for ¬£3,840. To Joseph Mayer he bequeathed his manuscript compilations and other collections, extending to about two hundred folios, and including his Account of Engravers. References * ;Attribution T.

Attached to the rural community of Ngayokhem, it is located in the area of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Sine, west of Senegal. The population is overrun by the Serers. As of 2006 to 2007, the population was estimated at 3000. Ndokh, which was a colony of Tukar, is now a separate village. History According to Serer tradition Tukar was founded by Lamane Jegan Joof (French spelling in Senegal: Lamane Djigan Diouf). There are various versions of the tradition, but the basic story has a hero-migrant, Jegan Joof migrating from Lambaye looking for land to exploit. When he arrived at Tukar, it was nothing more than an inhospitable forest. In accordance with the complex land law system of the Serer people, he was the one who cleared the fields and founded Tukar. His paternal descendants (the Joof family) reigned there for several centuries. In 1937, Biram Diouf (English spelling in the Gambia: Biram Joof), a descendant of Lamane Jegan Joof, was short of money and decided to pawn his family's estate (a form of mortgage known in the Serer language as taile) to Waly Sene, the Jaraff of Tukar (representative of the local king). The Joof family of Tukar almost lost their ancestral land. It took 50 years for a great-grandson of Biram Diouf called Djignak Diouf to eventually repay the descendants of Waly Sene and reclaimed his family's estate. Etymology The name Tukar consists of two Serer words: tuuk (\\"shut up\\") and kar-kar (\\"just kidding\\"). According to Serer oral tradition, an adventurer by the name of Fassamane Thiaw (or Chaw) paid a visit to Lamane Jegan Joof during the harvest season. Lamane Jegan Joof was to have a very good harvest of millet that year and Fassamane Thiaw is reported to have exclaimed, \\"Ooh, you're going have quite bit of millet!\\" The Lamane was so surprised he immediately replied: \\"Tuuk!\\" - which means \\"shut up!\\" in Serer language. He then ordered Fassamane Thiaw to say \\"kar-kar\\" (\\"just kidding\\"). This is said to be the origin of the name Tukar. According to historians, Lamane Jegan Joof had certainly been very shocked by the remark of Fassamane Thiaw about his promising harvest, but, above all, the bad spirits could be listening and decide to take revenge as a result of jealousy and introduce plague or locusts. This ancient superstition still prevails in Senegambia. The Serers and other ethnic groups of Senegambia forbid drawing attention to success or good fortune, because they fear that the bad spirits may become jealous and take revenge. If one mistakenly offers a compliment or comment on someone's good harvest, one is expected to quickly add kar-kar (just kidding), to ward off bad luck. Status The foundation of Tukar by Jegan Joof is occasionally taught to young children at the local school of Kane Faye. In the Serer religious calendar, the Raan festival is held in Tukar once a year on the second Thursday after the new moon in April. The Pangool of Tukar of is Lungu√± Joof (or Lungu√± Juuf in Serer). In popular culture Senegalese artist Ang√©lique Dione's 2017 track Toukar pays homage to Tukar. The track has a salsa vibe in which Ang√©lique, who is a native of Tukar plays the guitar.AllAfrica.com (French), S√©n√©gal: Ang√®lique Dione, chanteuse - Du choeur de louanges √† la musique acoustique, by Omar Diouf, 24 February 2012 Angelique Dione's official YouTube channel, Angelique Dione, Toukar, published on 28 May 2017 Community life Founded in 1986, the Association of Peasants of Tukar (APT) (French: l'Association des Paysans de Tukar) is a rural association that promotes community cohesion and self-sufficiency.

Rossier was the first media professional to get exclusive access to Aristide while in exile and the resultant interview is featured in the film, as well as interviews with many experts on Haiti, including U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs and Aristide's lawyer Ira J. Kurzban. Background Jean-Bertrand Aristide won Haiti's first democratic presidential election in 1990 but was overthrown and exiled the following year. He was restored to his presidency in 1994 and won the next election in 2000 but 2004 brought another coup which removed Aristide from power once again. Although he was and remains extremely popular with Haitian citizens, many critics and opponents of the man contend that his government was rife with corruption and ineffective at addressing the country's severe economic woes. The role of the U.S. government in the 2004 ouster remains highly contentious. The film delves into the build-up of that event, as well as the history of Haitian independence and the rise of Aristide from poverty to presidency. Rossier speaks with many prominent figures in and outside of Haiti, including American author and academic Noam Chomsky, actor and activist Danny Glover and the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs under President George W. Bush, Roger Noriega. Reception The film was released in 2005 and screened at many festivals worldwide, including Vancouver, S√£o Paulo, BAFICI, Cuba, IDFA in Amsterdam and RIDM in Montreal. It won \\"Best Feature Documentary\\" and the audience award for best documentary at the Los Angeles Pan-African Film Festival. It opened on televisions in Canada CBC Radio Canada, France Public Senat and on selective PBS stations and Link TV in the USA and received critical praise throughout its theatrical and broadcast runs. The film was widely reviewed and garnered positive write-ups in many publications including The New York TimesLaura Kern, \\"Turmoil in Haiti, Seen Close Up\\", The New York Times, November 17, 2005. and Variety.https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117929943?refcatid=31 Haitian activist Nadine Dominique - daughter of slain journalist Jean Dominique - declared that \\"the film deserves to be seen by Haitians ... [it] seems to be exactly what we need today\\". Paul Farmer, founder of Partners in Health and featured in the documentary, wrote that, \\"I saw it twice and showed it to friends in Haiti... [it is] a great tool.\\" The film was nominated at IDFA in Amsterdam for the Amnesty International Doen Award.

It sold in small numbers but set several records, still holding the world absolute solo glider endurance record of 56 h 15 m. Design and development The successful German Jacobs Weihe sailplane of 1938 strongly influenced several wartime and postwar designs such as the Italian CVV-6 Canguro and the British Slingsby Gull 4 and Sky. The Arsenal 100 was also Weihe based, with the intention of improving on that design. Work began before the war within a small design group named the Groupe de l'Air, led by Raymond Jarlaud. The wings of the two aircraft are similar in design and construction. Both have spans of 18.0 m (59 ft 1 in) and are straight tapered with rounded wing tips, although the Air's taper ratio (wing root chord to tip chord) is higher, resulting a slightly greater aspect ratio. Some later Air 100s have squared-off tips terminated in streamlined \\"salmons\\". Both wings use the G√∂ttingen 549 airfoil inboard of the tips, though the Air's roots have a thickened version. They are wooden single spar structures, plywood covered ahead of the spar and fabric covered behind. The Air 100 has slotted ailerons to improve roll rates and, inboard, has Schempp-Hirth parallel-rule airbrakes mounted immediately aft of the main spar; the Weihe's DFS style brakes had never been very effective, largely because their design placed them further aft on the wing where space did not allow them to open fully. The tail units of the two types are also similar, with ply covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces. The Air 100 has a broader chord fin and there are detailed differences in shape, but both place a broad, curved rudder on a hinge roughly in line with the elevator trailing edge. There are significant differences in the fuselages, though both are rounded, ply covered structures. The Weihe has a relatively slender rear fuselage, achieved by placing the wing high on a pylon behind the cockpit. In order to improve the aerodynamics of the wing-fuselage junction the Air's designers deepened the fuselage and mounted the wing at shoulder height. The prototype had no dihedral but this is used on production aircraft. The cockpit canopy is higher, more curved and with fewer frames on the post-war design. Originally the Air 100 landed on a skid and tail bumper but on production aircraft there is a fixed monowheel under mid-chord, with the rear part of the skid removed. The Air 100 flew for the first time on 10 June 1947. The production aircraft that followed the two prototypes were 43 kg (95 ) heavier empty. Operational history The Air 100 made its debut in competition gliding when the two prototypes, recently completed at the Ch√¢tillon Air Arsenal and after only 3 h flight testing, flew in the American National Championships held at Wichita Falls, Kansas in July 1947. They came in fifth and eighth. In 1948, Donald Pollard flew from Elmira, NY to Asbury Park, NJ to win the Barringer Trophy in his Air 100. The type's most enduring achievement was made in 1952 when it set a new solo world duration record of 56 h 15 min. The pilot was Charles Atger. The record was set on 2‚Äì4 April at Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, ridge sailing an Air 100 over the Chaine des Alpilles in the northern Mistral wind. Thirty months later another pilot, Bertrand Dauvin (21), in a different sailplane, was killed attempting to improve on Atger's record; the crash was attributed to pilot exhaustion and the FAI rejected further duration record claims for gliders. Thus Atger's record still stands and he was alive to celebrate its 40th anniversary. A new women's out and return world distance record was set on 12 May 1953 by Marcelle Choisnet with a 290 km (180 mi) flight from Beynes via Romilly-sur- Seine. She also set a declared goal women's record of 510 km (317 mi) in May 1954 in an Air 102. The Airs set other records and were competing successfully in France throughout the early 1950s. Some remained active much longer: three Air 100s and two Air 102s remained on the European civil aircraft registers in 2010, though one of the latter was dismantled.

She was known for journalism, essays, novels and biographies, particularly as an authority on Wedgwood pottery and its creator. She made a living writing for periodicals. Life The daughter of William Meteyard, a surgeon, and his wife Mary, daughter of Zebedee Beckham of Great Yarmouth, she was born on 21 June 1816, in Lime Street, Liverpool. In 1818 her father became surgeon to the Shropshire militia; she went to Shrewsbury, and in 1829 moved to Thorpe, near Norwich, which was her formative place as she came of age. She left Norwich in 1842, at age 25, and settled in London. She brought forward proposals for female education, and was active in the Whittington Club - a social and debating club that uniquely gave full membership to lower middle-class women of learning. Meteyard died on 4 April 1879 at Stanley Terrace, Fentiman Road, South Lambeth. For a number of years she had enjoyed a civil list pension. A marble medallion of her was executed by Giovanni Fontana, and once belonged to her friend Joseph Mayer, who had helped her in bringing out the Life of Wedgwood. Works Meteyard began literary work in 1833 by assisting her eldest brother, a tithe commissioner, in preparing his reports relating to the eastern counties. She afterwards became a regular contributor of fiction and social articles to the periodical press, writing in Eliza Cook's Journal, the People's Journal, Tait's Magazine, Chambers's Journal, Household Words, Country Words, and other journals. One of the topics she highlighted was women's role in emigration. To the first number of Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper she contributed a leading article; Douglas Jerrold appended the signature of \\"Silverpen\\", which she adopted as pen name. She gained prizes for essays on Juvenile Depravity and Omnibus Conductors. Her first novel was written in 1840 for Tait's Magazine, and republished in 1845 as Struggles for Fame. Her most popular novels were Mainstone's House keeper, 1860, and Lady Herbert's Gentle-woman, 1862. Between 1850 and 1878 she wrote a series of stories and novels for children. Her girls' novel Dora and Her Papa is a vivid account of a child's life among antiquarians in the Derbyshire Peak District. For Howitt's Journal, started by William Howitt and Mary Howitt, Meteyard wrote fiction highlighting small-scale social reform. Her view of prostitution was based on research in police and prison reports. In 1862, Meteyard turned to non-fiction with Hallowed Spots of Ancient London and in 1865‚Äì6 her major Life of Josiah Wedgwood, in two volumes. She used the Wedgwood papers collected by Joseph Mayer; she also acknowledged help from Bennett Woodcroft and Samuel Smiles. This work was followed in 1871 by A Group of Englishmen (1795‚Äì1815), being Records of the younger Wedgwoods and their Friends. In 1875 she wrote The Wedgwood Handbook, a Manual for Collectors, and contributed the letterpress descriptions to Wedgwood and his Works, 1873, Memorials of Wedgwood, 1874, Choice Examples of Wedgwood Ware, 1879, and a Catalogue of Wedgwood Manufactures.

The Turtle Conservancy envisions a world where all species of turtles and tortoises ultimately thrive in the wild. The Turtle Conservancy is a comprehensive conservation organization protecting tortoises and freshwater turtles. The organization's work encompasses five programmatic areas: species conservation, protecting wild lands, research science, global awareness and education, and illegal trade prevention. The TC has supported projects on the ground to protect endangered turtles and tortoises in China, Guyana, India, Mexico, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, South Africa, the Philippines, and the United States, and has conducted fieldwork around the world, particularly in Southeast Asia, investigating the turtle and tortoise trade. Programs The Turtle Conservancy's in-country conservation strategies include habitat protection, restoration and stewardship, turtle and tortoise reintroduction and a fieldwork grant program. = Geometric tortoise - South Africa = The geometric tortoise (Psammobates geometricus) is a small tortoise with a domed carapace and yellow and black radiating pattern. Fully grown, it reaches only five to six inches. In South Africa, the Turtle Conservancy, along with its partner organizations, has purchased 1,000 acres of the last remaining habitat for this critically endangered tortoise, creating the Geometric Tortoise Preserve. The TC has partnered with the Cape Province wildlife agency Cape Nature and turtle biologist Dr. Margaretha HofmeyrTurtle biologist Dr. Margaretha Hofmeyr http://www.bcb.uwc.ac.za/staff/rhofmeyr.asp on two projects related to the critically endangered geometric tortoise. =Goode's thornscrub tortoise - Mexico= The Goode's thornscrub tortoise (Gopherus evgoodei) was described in 2015 by scientists Mercy Vaughn and lead author Dr. Taylor Edwards of the University of Arizona in honor of Turtle Conservancy co-founder Eric Goode. The Turtle Conservancy secured approximately 1,000 acres of tropical deciduous forest in southern Sonora, Mexico, for the protection of this newly described species. The property targeted for this land acquisition has been identified for its excellent tortoise habitat, and for its ideal location adjoining a nature reserve, the Reserva Monte Mojino. This project will not only contribute to the survival of a tortoise species but also the rich biodiversity associated with this ecosystem. This protected area will safeguard the globally endangered tropical deciduous forest ecosystem supporting 36 families of tropical trees, 48 species of orchids, the highest diversity of birds in Sonora, 5 species of wild cats, and 79 species of amphibians and reptiles. The entire area will be owned and managed by Nature and Culture International, the organization that currently manages the Reserva Monte Mojino. =Bolson tortoise - Mexico= The Turtle Conservancy has purchase 43,000 acres of the last remaining habitat of the Bolson tortoise (Gopherus flavomarginatus), in the state of Durango, Mexico. The largest of the North American terrestrial reptiles, this tortoise has been known to science only since 1959. The Bolson tortoise inhabits a small area of Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠ in the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. The Mapim√≠ Biosphere Reserve was created to protect this species, but much of this land is used for agricultural development and cattle grazing, which is threatening the tortoise's habitat. The acquisition of this land in north central Mexico will protect the tortoise along with all other native flora and fauna including an estimated 28 mammals, over 200 bird species, 5 amphibians, and 39 reptiles. The Turtle Conservancy began this collaborative effort with assistance from the Andrew Sabin Family Foundation, Josiah T. Austin, and the Desert Tortoise Council and will be working in conjunction with the Turner Endangered Species Fund. =Ploughshare tortoise - Madagascar= In Madagascar the Turtle Conservancy collaborates with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT)Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust http://www.durrell.org to protect the ed ploughshare tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora) from extinction. The Turtle Conservancy engages in the education of local communities and in animal marking to help reduce the illegal poaching of ploughshare tortoises. In addition, the Turtle Conservancy is a leading member of the International Ploughshare Tortoise Working Group, which sets the direction for ploughshare tortoise conservation worldwide. Today the ploughshare tortoise is the second rarest tortoise in the world and can be sold on the black market for prices ranging from a few thousand dollars for juveniles to tens of thousands for adults. The immediate goals for the species are to stop poaching and to reclaim animals from illegal collections and place them in accredited captive breeding programs. = Palawan forest turtle - Philippines = On the Island of Palawan in the Philippines 1,890 acres was secured for the protection of the critically endangered Palawan forest turtle. This effort is being led by the Katala Foundation Inc. (KFI), with support from the Turtle Conservancy, Rainforest Trust, and Global Wildlife Conservation. The local government of Mendoza with help from the municipal government of Roxas, Palawan, designated this acreage as a protected watershed, in effect creating a wildlife protection area which will directly benefit this turtle. An additional 23 acres of land was purchased outright from local farmers to prevent further agricultural development and restore its original riverside rainforest habitat. =Golden coin turtle - China= The Turtle Conservancy works with Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (KFBG), and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. to return critically endangered golden coin turtles (Cuora trifasciata) to their native habitat in southern China.http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-03/15/content_16311363.htm These critically endangered turtles will remain on the protected grounds of KFBG as part of its Endangered Species Conservation Program, until they may be safely released into the wild. This turtle faces extinction due to the wildlife trade and the high value placed on it. Eating the animal in a jelly called guilinggao is falsely believed to promote general well being, but it is also purported to be a cure for everything from acne to cancer. Due to these false beliefs, the golden coin turtle is one of the highest priced turtles in the trade, with prices for a single animal ranging from $10,000 to as high as $25,000. This program is the first repatriation of turtles captive-bred in another country (United States) back to their home country of China. =Diamondback terrapin - United States= The Turtle Conservancy is a proud partner of the Terrapin Nesting Project on Long Beach Island, New Jersey. The Terrapin Nesting Project is a grassroots organization founded by Kathy Lacey in 2011 with the ongoing support of the Sierra Club. The aim is to restore terrapin populations on Long Beach Island by protecting nests and releasing hatchlings back into the bay through the Adopt-a-Nest program. Visitors can adopt a nest in the spring for a nominal fee and then participate in releasing hatchlings when the nests hatch in late summer. In addition, Lacey and her team of volunteers are \\"re-beaching\\" yards with sand, replacing the decorative rock and clay yards that have displaced original nesting areas. Northern diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin terrapin) are native to the East Coast of the United States and over the past two centuries have seen their numbers dwindle precipitously. Through the grassroots effort of Lacey and her team of volunteers, terrapin numbers are on the rise. In 2017 alone, over 3,000 hatchling terrapins were released back into the wild. =Conservation Center= The Turtle Conservancy's Conservation Center is the only zoological facility dedicated to turtle and tortoises certified by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Founded in 2005, upon the request of John L. Behler (1943-2006), the international turtle conservationist and then curator of herpetology at the Bronx Zoo, to provide a home for the Wildlife Conservation Society's established turtle and tortoise assurance colony. These original 130 tortoises were personally escorted by Turtle Conservancy staff across the country from St. Catherine's Island, Georgia to BCC's new facility in southern California.Hillard, Gloria (February 27, 2014) \\"To Save Endangered Tortoises, Conservationists Deface Their Shells\\" National Public Radio The group included founder animals of the radiated tortoise (Astrochelys radiata) Species Survival Plan and the first recorded hatchling spider tortoises (Pyxis arachnoides) in the US. Most of these animals remain active in the BCC breeding program today. The organization's conservation center runs breeding programs for 32 species of endangered turtles and tortoises, 12 of which are on the \\"Top 40 Most Endangered\\" list, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group. The center currently manages assurance colonies representing over of the world's top critically endangered turtle and tortoise taxa. The Turtle Conservancy has had success breeding a variety of species including the critically endangered Burmese star tortoise, Chaco tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis), parrot-beaked padloper (Homopus areolatus), speckled padloper (Homopus signatus), Assam roofed turtle (Pangshura sylhetensis), Okinawa leaf turtle (Geoemyda japonica), and the impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Over the past 13 years, the TC has supported researchers, ecologists, conservationists, naturalists, students, and artists. Many of the world's leading authorities on turtles and tortoises have spent time on the campus learning about the husbandry, genetics, and natural history of these incredible animals. Many influential artists and wildlife photographers have also engaged with the collection to help promote turtle and tortoise conservation. Similarly, students from all over the world have been funded or sponsored by the Turtle Conservancy to participate in turtle and tortoise conservation. =Trade monitoring and interdiction= The global trade in turtles and tortoises for food, traditional medicine, and pets is the most serious threat to many turtles and tortoises. Unfortunately poaching and the trade can cause extinction even where there is still ample habitat. The Turtle Conservancy works with TRAFFIC, the international wildlife trade monitoring group, and with governments to monitor smugglers and provide care for confiscated animals. Working closely with TRAFFIC Southeast Asia, the TC financially supports one staff member in Southeast Asia who is dedicated solely to monitoring turtles and tortoises in illegal trade routes and markets in SE Asia. TRAFFIC SE Asia has been investigating the trade in tortoises for the past ten years, including the four species originating from Madagascar. However, TRAFFIC's resources are limited, and therefore monitoring and investigative work has been somewhat ad hoc. At present, TRAFFIC is targeting five hubs in five countries‚ÄîBangkok, Jakarta, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Manila‚Äîspecifically to address the illegal trade activities of the four critically endangered Malagasy tortoise species, but also to monitor the trade in all threatened tortoises and freshwater turtles. =Global awareness and education= With the hope of inspiring a global groundswell of conservation action to save the world's turtles and tortoises, the Turtle Conservancy uses media and education in its ongoing Turtles in Crisis awareness campaign. The Turtle Conservancy shines a spotlight on the global turtle crisis through a comprehensive and ongoing global media campaign. Since its inception, many millions of people have heard the message. Scientific and international media outlets including CBS 60 Minutes, PBS Charlie Rose, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Dodo, and National Public Radio have profiled the Turtle Conservancy. The Tortoise magazine  The Tortoise is a bi-annual publication dedicated to the appreciation and conservation of tortoises and turtles and their habitats as they relate to culture, the arts, and the global human experience..  \\"Turtles in Trouble\\"  A report just published by the Turtle Conservation Coalition* calls attention to the grave conservation status of the world's tortoises and freshwater turtles. According to \\"Turtles in Trouble: The World‚Äôs 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles ‚Äì 2018\\", more than half of the currently recognized 356 species of turtles and tortoises are threatened with extinction.

Birks) is an empirical formula for the light yield per path length as a function of the energy loss per path length for a particle traversing a scintillator, and gives a relation that is not linear at high loss rates. Overview The relation is: : \\\\frac{dL}{dx} = S \\\\frac{\\\\frac{dE}{dx}}{1+k_B\\\\frac{dE}{dx}}. where L is the light yield, S is the scintillation efficiency, dE/dx is the energy loss of the particle per path length, and kB is Birks' constant, which depends on the material. kB is 0.126 mm/MeV for polystyrene-based scintillators and 1.26‚Äì2.07 √ó 10‚àí2 g/(MeV cm2) for polyvinyltoluene-based scintillators. Birks speculated that the loss of linearity is due to recombination and quenching effects between the excited molecules and the surrounding substrate. Birks' law has mostly been tested for organic scintillators. Its applicability to inorganic scintillators is debated. A good discussion can be found in Particle Detectors at Accelerators: Organic scintillators. A compilation of Birks' constant for various materials can be found in Semi-empirical calculation of quenching factors for ions in scintillators. A more complete theory of scintillation saturation, that gives Birks' law when only unimolecular de-excitation is included, can be found in a paper by Blanc, Cambou, and De Laford.

He previously pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Seattle Mariners. He also played for the Yokohama DeNA BayStars of Japan's NPB and the Kia Tigers of Korea's KBO League. Early life Wieland was named Nevada State Player of the Year by the Las Vegas Review-Journal and the Reno Gazette-Journal while at Bishop Manogue High School in Reno, Nevada. He committed to playing college baseball at San Diego State. Professional career =Texas Rangers= Wieland was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the fourth round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with the Rangers and did not play for San Diego State. Wieland spent 2009 with the Class A Hickory Crawdads where he posted a 5.31 ERA in 19 games. He opened 2010 with the Crawdads, but an improved 3.34 ERA in 15 games earned him a promotion to the California League High-A Bakersfield Blaze in July. In 2011, Wieland started the year with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, the Rangers' new High-A affiliate, and then graduated to Double-A in late June. On July 29, 2011, while pitching for the Frisco RoughRiders, Wieland threw a no-hitter against the San Antonio Missions, the Padres Double-A affiliate. Wieland had a 1.23 ERA in 7 starts for the RoughRiders. =San Diego Padres= On July 31, 2011, Wieland and Robbie Erlin were traded to the San Diego Padres for Mike Adams. He finished the year with the Double-A Missions, posting a 2.77 ERA in 5 starts. He had 8.7 strike-outs per 9 innings across all three clubs in 2011. Wieland started 2012 with the Triple-A Tucson Padres, but only made 2 starts before he was called up to the Major League team. Wieland was called up to join the Padres' rotation when both Tim Stauffer and Dustin Moseley went on the disabled list early in the season. He made his Major League debut on April 14, 2012, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, allowing six runs in five innings to take the loss. Wieland made five starts for the Padres, losing four of them, and posted a 4.55 ERA before he went to the disabled list in May with shoulder tightness. He underwent a season-ending Tommy John surgery on July 27, 2012. Wieland began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list as he was still recovering from the surgery. He began a throwing program at around mid- season but he suffered a number of setbacks due to soreness and a stress reaction and missed the entire season. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on his elbow at the start of the 2014 season and did not make his return to the Padres until September 6, 2014. In four appearances for the Padres in 2014, he allowed nine runs in 11 innings. He finally picked up his first MLB win on September 24 against the Colorado Rockies. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On December 18, 2014, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Yasmani Grandal and Zach Eflin) in exchange for Matt Kemp, Tim Federowicz and cash. He was assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers. Wieland was called up to the Dodgers on May 6, 2015, to start a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. He allowed six runs in 4 innings and was promptly optioned back to AAA following the game. He made a second start on September 9, allowing two runs in four innings. In 21 starts (and one relief appearance) for Oklahoma City, he was 10‚Äì5 with a 4.59 ERA. The Dodgers re-signed him to a one-year, $590,000 contract after the season to avoid salary arbitration. =Seattle Mariners= On January 12, 2016, Wieland was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for minor league infielder Erick Mejia. The Mariners traded Wieland to the Atlanta Braves on September 14, and he was assigned to Triple A Gwinnett. =Yokohama DeNA BayStars= On 7 November 2016, it was announced that Wieland had signed with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars in the NPB for the 2017 season. =Kia Tigers= On December 5, 2018, Wieland signed with the Kia Tigers of the KBO League. He became a free agent following the season. =Chicago Cubs= On September 10, 2020, Wieland signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs and was added to their 60-man player pool.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/09/cubs-release-steven-souza-jr.html Scouting report Wieland throws from a three quarters angle with a repeatable delivery.

TMRS was established in 1947 by Texas state law and is administered in accordance with the Texas Municipal Retirement System Act (Texas Government Code, Title 8, Subtitle G). Although established under state law, TMRS receives no state funding. The System offers a choice of benefits so that each participating city can design a plan to suit its needs and budget. Each city's plan is funded independently by that city. Retirement benefits for employees of participating cities are paid from the employees‚Äô contributions, city contributions, and the System's investment income.  Distinguishing Features of the System  TMRS administers a program for (currently) 883 cities, providing retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to active and retired municipal employees. Distinguishing features of the System are: * TMRS is a statewide retirement system that cities may elect to join * TMRS is a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äùcash-balance defined benefit retirement plan rather than a traditional, formula-based defined benefit plan * TMRS does not receive any state funds and does not administer a health care plan * Benefits are based on a member‚Äôs account balance at retirement. The retirement benefit is funded through mandatory employee deposits, city contributions, and investment income * For a maximum benefit TMRS plan, investment income provides as much as 80% of a 20-year employee‚Äôs benefit As of December 31, 2017, TMRS had 110,208 employee accounts and 62,776 retirement accounts. TMRS paid $1.25 billion in benefits in 2017, up from $1.16 billion in 2016.As of most recent annual financial report, 12/31/17 Conservative Plan Features - TMRS‚Äô Investment Return Assumption is currently 6.75%. Each city's unfunded liability is amortized over a closed period of no more than 30 years. Each member's benefits are advance funded over the member's working career. Contribution ‚Äúholidays‚Äù are not allowed; every city must pay its required contribution. Funded Status - The funded status (ratio) of TMRS, as a system, was 87.4% as of 12/31/2017. This funded ratio has trended upward over the past few years.  Investments  TMRS administered $28.9 billion in assets as of December 31, 2017. The Investments Department at TMRS follows these Total Portfolio Performance Objectives: * Achieve a Total Rate of Return, over rolling five-year periods, consistent with the assumed long-term rate of return on TMRS assets adopted by the board (currently 6.75%) * Exceed an appropriate benchmark reflective of asset class participation over rolling five-year periods (i.e., Policy Index) Diversification has been, and continues to be, implemented through a deliberate multi-year process. The current asset allocation strategy is expected to meet the long-term total return objective of 6.75%, consistent with the actuarial interest rate assumption for the plan. The overall one-year gross rate of return for 2017 on the investment portfolio was 14.27%. A detailed summary of investment operations during 2017, including performance of different asset classes and diversification progress, is found in the Investment Section of the CAFR.  Governance  The TMRS Act provides that the administration of TMRS is entrusted to a six-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Texas Senate. Board members serve on a volunteer basis and are employed by a TMRS-participating city. Per the Texas Constitution, Trustees continue to perform the duties of their office until a successor has been duly qualified. Board members serve staggered, six-year terms. The Board oversees the administration of TMRS and exercises fiduciary responsibility for investments.

History The Club Atl√©tico Jorge Newbery was officially established on 19 April 1924 as \\"Nacional Foot-Ball Club\\". The club formed from the merge of two clubs from the city: Sportivo Rivadavia and Correos y Tel√©grafos. On 23 May 1934 the club was forced to change its name because of a decree promulgated by de facto President of Argentina Agust√≠n Pedro Justo. That decree established the prohibition of using the word \\"National\\" in any entity or particular association. On 30 June 1934 an assembly was held to rename the institution. One of the proposals was \\"Argentinos del Sud\\" although the club finally chose the name \\"Jorge Newbery\\" as a tribute to the most important sportsman to date. The first match as Jorge Newbery was played on 8 July 1934, beating Gimnasia y Esgrima 3‚Äì1. That same year the club began to build its sports field, which lasted until 2008 when Jorge Newbery opened its new facilities.\\"Historia del Club\\" ‚Äì official website References External links * *Official site *Newbery es Comodoro Jorge Newbery Category:1924 establishments in Argentina Category:Sports clubs named after people ","title":"Jorge Newbery de Comodoro Rivadavia"},{"id":"35475754","text":"Ferunabad (, also Romanized as Fer≈´nƒÅbƒÅd, FarenƒÅbƒÅd, FarnƒÅbƒÅd, FarvƒÅnƒÅbƒÅd, Fir‚ÄòaunƒÅbƒÅd, Firƒ´nƒ´ƒÅbƒÅd, ForunƒÅbƒÅd FroonƒÅbƒÅd) is a city in Ferunabad Rural District, in the Central District of Pakdasht County, Tehran Province, Iran.

It is quite small but full of intricate detail. A very popular image, copied by other printmakers within five years of creation, it is found in most major print room collections, including the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the UK Royal Collection. Description The Holy Family with the Dragonfly, alternately known as The Holy Family with the Butterfly, The Holy Family with the Locust, and The Virgin with the Dragonfly, is an early engraving by D√ºrer. It depicts both the Holy Family and the Holy Trinity, as the Virgin Mary sits on a bench holding Jesus with Joseph beside them, while God the Father and the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove look down from the clouds. In the lower right corner is an insect frequently identified as a dragonfly. However, D√ºrer may have intended it as a butterfly, a creature whose dramatically transformative life-cycle makes it a perfect symbol of resurrection and redemption. The abundance of beautifully-rendered textures in the richly detailed landscape show how early D√ºrer mastered the art of engraving. History A variant: The Holy Family with the Mayfly (NGA 1943.3.3453) The exact date of creation is not known. It may have been an imitative piece from his apprenticeship, a copy of older master such as Martin Schongauer. The precise shape of D√ºrer's monogram is most similar to works dated 1494-95, and the presence of a gondola in the background places it after his 1494 trip to Venice. It is the first print on which he placed his monogram, and the only one in which the D is lowercase. By placing his mark on it, he claimed authorship of the work, unlike the numerous anonymous artists of his day. This act of ownership offered no protection, however, since his international renown as an artistic genius meant copies appeared throughout Italy and Germany by 1500. In D√ºrer's Germany, Mary and Jesus were grounded and human, making them highly sympathetic for mere mortals. That meant tender scenes such as this were extremely popular. D√ºrer made many prints of this theme to be sold in shops and by traveling salesmen so worshipers could paste them into books or attach them to walls as devotional objects. Insect Insect in D√ºrer's The Holy Family with the Mayfly. Detail of \\"mayfly\\" in lower right corner of engraving The type of insect that D√ºrer depicted is unclear. While it is commonly named as a dragonfly (Odonata), Kate Heard and Lucy Whitaker in their book The Northern Renaissance. D√ºrer to Holbein (2011) suggest that he may have meant it to be read as a butterfly (Lepidoptera). They explain that the butterfly's familiar transformation from caterpillar to winged adult was a symbol of resurrection and the soul's redemption, referring to the infant Christ in the Virgin's arms. The painting is indeed sometimes also called the Holy Family with the Butterfly. The insect has also been taken to be a locust (Acrididae) or a praying mantis (Mantodea), \\"with the symbolic meaning in relation to the Virgin changing accordingly.\\" The common European mayfly Ephemera vulgata A similar engraving in the American National Gallery of Art is named The Holy Family with the Mayfly, identifying the insect as a mayfly (Ephemeroptera). The critics Larry Silver and Pamela H. Smith write that the image provides \\"an explicit link between heaven and earth.. to suggest a cosmic resonance between sacred and profane, celestial and terrestrial, macrocosm and microcosm.\\" Artist Collections * Indianapolis Museum of Art (USA) * Royal Collection (UK) * National Gallery of Art See also * Visitation (D√ºrer) * Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate (D√ºrer) References External links *Indianapolis Museum of Art page Category:Prints of the Indianapolis Museum of Art Category:Prints by Albrecht D√ºrer Category:Virgin Mary in art Category:Jesus in art Category:Saint Joseph in art Category:Ships in art Category:Insects in art Category:15th-century engravings ","title":"The Holy Family with the Dragonfly"},{"id":"35475810","text":"Qaleh Now-e Amlak (, also Romanized as Qal‚Äòeh Now-e AmlƒÅk; also known as Qal‚Äòeh Now) is a village in Ferunabad Rural District, in the Central District of Pakdasht County, Tehran Province, Iran.

As the album's subtitle suggests, the album celebrates and documents the first five years of the Ministry of Sound as a nightclub. It is a box set and contains three discs, the first disc, Rulin', is based around the club's Rulin' garage nights and is mixed by CJ Mackintosh and Todd Terry. The second disc, Frisky?, is based around its Frisky? house nights and is mixed by Seb Fontaine and Jon Pleased Wimmin. The third disc, Logical Progression, is mixed entirely by LTJ Bukem and is based around his Logical Progression drum and bass nights.Various - One Half Of A Whole Decade - Five Years At Ministry Of Sound (CD) at Discogs The album's elaborate, unusual packaging, designed by Soctt Parker, is a homage of the foil packaging that computer components are sold in, complete with details such as warning details and bar codes. The album was critically acclaimed and was a commercial success, reaching number 9 on the UK Compilation Chart. The album also precedes later anniversary mix albums released by the club such as Fifteen Years and Live & Remastered. Background The Ministry of Sound had opened as a house and garage house-orientated nightclub in Elephant & Castle, London, in September 1991, and quickly developed into a world-renowned nightclub in the ensuing years. According to club biographer, Andy Pemberton, as of mid-1996, the nightclub's \\"personality\\" was divided between the Frisky and Rulin' nights at the weekend, which played house and garage music \\"where the patrons swoon to the latest garage guidance counselors\\", and the Logical Progression nights mixed by LTJ Bukem, which featured \\"the hard edged underground throb of drum and bass.\\"Liner notes. The nightclub celebrated its fifth anniversary in September 1996 in numerous different ways, the most notorious being the projection of their logo onto Buckingham Palace with the message that the Ministry of Sound \\"lasts longer than a royal marriage,\\" in reference to Prince Charles and Princess Diana's divorce.The Annual II liner notes. One of the anniversary celebrations was to release an anniversary DJ mix album, One Half of a Whole Decade, to reflect both the five years of the club's history and also its future. Clare Gage, Grace Garcia Sutcliffe, Lynn Cosgrave, Mark Rodol, Russell Bradley, Simon Gurney and Steve Canueto all conceived, produced, marketed and \\"agonised over\\" the album. \\"Jacko\\" \\"lovingly mastered\\" the entire album at Masterpiece Mastering. Content One Half of a Whole Decade celebrates five years of the Ministry of Sound and is a document of those five years, with each disc based around a different night at the club. According to AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier, the album \\"attempts to present a quick summary of the massive developments made in the genre of electronic dance music in the early '90s. Of course, since this is a Ministry of Sound album, the DJs and tracks are very typical of the glamorous London club.\\" The triple album features five different DJs compiling and mixing the tracks. The first disc, Rulin', is based around the club's pioneering Rulin' nights which began in 1994. These nights, which played house and garage, were and remain one of the club's flagship events, and had become \\"instrumental in championing American house music back in the mid-1990s.\\" The first half is mixed by the night's resident CJ Mackintosh and its second half by Todd Terry, who had also played Rulin'. The second disc, Frisky?, is based around the club's then- Friday night event Frisky?, described in the album's liner notes by Lucy Vignola as \\"a night of hedonistic, atmospheric, raunchy, burning house that smashes the north/south club divide and breaks the barriers surrounding dance music genres.\\" The first half of the disc is mixed by the night's resident Seb Fontaine, who Vignola noted produces \\"the smoothest mix of upfront house around\\", and the second half by Jon Pleased Wimmin. LTJ Bukem (pictured in 2006) mixed the third disc, Logical Progression The third disc, Logical Progression, which plays as one continuous track, is mixed entirely by LTJ Bukem and is based around his Logical Progression nights at the club which themselves are based around drum and bass and \\"the future of dance music.\\" According to Justin James, \\"the Ministry of Sound has a reputation for telling it like it is. Logical Progression tells you how it's gonna be.\\" He described the nights as \\"an uncompromising selection of the latest dubplates [which take] you on a trip to a new sonic dimension of break beats and beyond. A soundtrack for the future.\\" The disc features extracts from the 1931 film Little Caesar, and is reflective of Bukem's record label Good Looking Records, and his own identically titled compilation series, Logical Progression. Birchmeier felt that Mackintosh, Terry and Wimmin's mixes are \\"very typical of what one might expect from the early to mid-'90s Ministry of Sound: accessible house music with tons of diva vocals and a light-hearted, gay mood,\\" whereas Fontaine and Bukem's mixes \\"are a bit less out of the ordinary and end up being the more rewarding mixes on this triple CD.\\" Fontaine, who was not well known at the time, mixes both forgotten \\"early-'90s club hits\\", such as Bizarre Inc's \\"Raise Me\\", and \\"some tracks that have been recognized as timeless classics\\", such as Jaydee's \\"Plastic Dreams\\", Leftfield's \\"Not Forgotten\\" and Golden Girls' \\"Kinetic\\". Release and reception One Half of a Whole Decade was released 2 September 1996 by the Ministry of Sound record label; although the label had released multiple DJ mix albums in different series, it was the label's second standalone DJ mix album.The Complete Book of the British Charts, Third edition (2003), pg. 1242 The album was dedicated to former Ministry of Sound DJs David Cole and Larry Levan, with the album booklet saying: \\"Your spirit lives on.\\" A commercial success, One Half of a Whole Decade reached number 9 on the UK Compilation Chart, and stayed on the chart for six weeks. A critical success, Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic was positive, highlighting Seb Fontaine and LTJ Bukem's mixes as the best due to their \\"less out of the ordinary\\" track listings. He noted that although Fontaine's mix \\"does include some forgettable early-'90s club hits such as Bizarre Inc's 'Raise Me,'\\" \\"the then-unknown DJ also lays down some tracks that have become recognized as timeless classics that sound just as good in the early part of the 21st century as they did back in the early '90s.\\" The album's unusual packaging, designed by the Ministry of Sound's art director Scott Parker, consists of cardboard sleeves stored in a rigid silver box, and is designed to resemble the shiny foil packets in which computer components are sold in, complete with details such as warning labels, futuristic typefaces and technical photographs. Parker explained: \\"We wanted to link the CD to a clothing idea and decided to pastiche the silver foil packaging for computer parts, complete with the yellow and red warning sticker and bar code. The aim is to look non-designed, that‚Äôs why I mixed up the fonts and played with the branding, adding a number of different, futuristic logos.\\" Parker chose not to vacuum pack the album, as the club's \\"arch rivals\\" Cream had already used the method for one of their DJ mix albums, and it \\"needed to be a sturdier, self-contained package\\", so the album's box was made by the London Fancy Box Company, and \\"each of the three CDs has its own sleeve.\\" In order to \\"make it feel like a piece of technical equipment,\\" Parker used photographs that Tony Stone had taken of a pressing plant, as well as \\"snapshots of the Ministry building.\\" In 1997, Design Week said the album's packaging was \\"definitely the best CD design to come out of [Ministry of Sound],\\" and commented that it \\"exudes both glamour and a sort of nerdy techno-aesthetic, and is lovely to look at, lovely to hold‚Ä¶ on a par with a very expensive box of chocolates.\\" The Logical Progression disc was later remastered and re- released as the first disc on Bukem's Logical Progression Part 1 compilation in March 2001, released on his label Good Looking Records.Logical Progression Part 1 liner notes. For this release, the individual songs were sequenced separately, rather than all on one track. The Ministry of Sound would later release other anniversary compilations for later anniversaries, namely Fifteen Years (2006), Live & Remastered (2011), XX: Twenty Years (2011) and XX: Twenty Years 2 (2012).

Professional career Before he became a major leaguer, he played in the 2003 and 2004 Little League World Series for Cura√ßao. Schoop was signed by the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent in 2008. In 2011, Schoop along with Manny Machado represented the Orioles at the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. He was awarded the Brooks Robinson Minor League Player of the Year, given to the best player in the Orioles minor league system. During his minor league career, Schoop was primarily a shortstop. Prior to the 2012 season, Schoop was ranked by Baseball America as the Orioles' third-best prospect and the 82nd-best overall. =Baltimore Orioles= 2013-2016 Schoop playing for the Baltimore Orioles in 2013 Schoop was recalled by the Orioles from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides on September 3, 2013. In his first major league at-bat on September 25, 2013, Schoop hit a single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Esmil Rogers. Two at-bats later, he hit his first career home run off Kyle Drabek, with a distance measured at 430 feet. He finished the game 2-for-3 with a home run, an RBI, a walk, and 3 runs scored. Schoop played in five games at the end of the year and hit .286 (4-for-14), scoring five runs, hitting one home run, and driving in one run. On April 9, 2014, Schoop hit the second home run of his career off of Yankees RHP Masahiro Tanaka, a towering three-run shot over the left field foul pole at Yankee Stadium helping the Orioles to a 5-4 victory. In 137 games of 2014, Schoop batted .209 with 16 home runs and 45 RBI. With the Orioles finishing 96-66, the team clinched their first regular season AL East championship since 1997.

On April 11, 2015, Schoop hit his first career grand slam, off of Toronto Blue Jays reliever, Todd Redmond. During a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 17, 2015, Schoop sustained a partially torn PCL and sprained MCL, which forced the Orioles to place him on the disabled list. Schoop would end up playing in 86 games during the 2015 season, collecting 85 hits (.279), 17 doubles, 15 home runs, 39 RBIs, and two steals in as many attempts. In 387 total chances, Schoop only committed seven errors for a .982 fielding percentage. The Orioles finished the season with an 81-81 record and missed out on the postseason. 2016-2018 Schoop hit .351 while hitting three home runs and driving in eight in the first ten games of 2016. By the end of April, he had hit four home runs, driven in 11, and hit .256. Schoop hit his first grand slam of the season on May 14 in a 9-3 comeback victory over the Tigers. It was Schoop's second home run of the game, and he drove in a total of five runs. On August 14, Schoop hit a go-ahead three run home run against San Francisco Giants closer Santiago Casilla in the top of the 9th inning to complete a seven run comeback for the Orioles, having trailed 7-1 prior to the 7th inning. Schoop hit his 20th home run of the season on August 22, his first career 20-homer season. He became the fifth Oriole on the year to have at least 20 home runs, making the Orioles the only Major League club to accomplish this feat on the year. On August 31, Schoop hit his 21st home run of the season, and the 55th of the month for the Orioles, tying an MLB record just two months after setting the home run record in June. Baltimore became the first team to hit 55+ home runs in a month on two occasions. Schoop hit his 25th home run of the season on September 30 against the Yankees, making him the fifth Oriole on the year with at least 25 homers. This tied the franchise record from 1996. They also became just the 12th team in MLB history to do so. It was also the Orioles 250th home run of the season, passing the 2000 Houston Astros for fifth most home runs in a single-season all-time. He finished the 2016 season with 38 doubles, 25 home runs, 82 RBI and batted .267/.298/.454 while starting all 162 regular season games, and the AL Wild Card game against the Toronto Blue Jays. Through July 2, 2017, Schoop compiled a .297/.352/.545 batting line with 16 homers, 23 doubles, 45 runs scored, 51 RBIs and 1.7 WAR, earning him a trip to the 2017 MLB All-Star Game.

On April 14, 2018, Schoop was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a right oblique strain. After a disappointing first half that saw him hit just .229 in the first half with ten homers and 25 RBI, Schoop got hot after the All-Star break, tying the MLB record for consecutive games with a home run by a second baseman, with five. =Milwaukee Brewers= On July 31, 2018, Schoop was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Jonathan Villar and minor leaguers Luis Ortiz and Jean Carmona.

Personal life Sayadaw U Tejaniya lived as a householder running a textile business until age thirty-six, which is atypical for Sayadaws in Myanmar. At various intervals during his pre-monastic life he studied intensively with Shwe Oo Min Sayadaw (1913‚Äì2002), a highly venerated figure who was one of the first meditation teachers trained by Mahasi Sayadaw. Sayadaw Tejaniya feels that because of his experience developing his practice while leading the life of a householder, he understands both the challenges yogis face in integrating their meditation practice with their everyday lives and how to overcome them. Another notable episode in his life was his struggle with two major episodes of clinical depression, which he credits with providing the motivation to develop his skills at mental self-investigation (Dhamma vicaya) to an extraordinary level. Pedagogical style Sayadaw's teaching style differs in emphasis somewhat from the style of Vipassana meditation generally practiced in Myanmar. Rather than making a single, primary object the focus of awareness for meditation, Sayadaw Tejaniya believes practitioners must first pay attention to the presence of defilements in the mind‚Äîgreed, aversion and delusion‚Äîwhich can make themselves subtly present while meditating and diminish the effectiveness of the practice. As Sayadaw Tejaniya has said, \\"Don‚Äôt reject any object that comes to your attention. The object of attention is not really important; the observing mind that is working in the background to be aware is of real importance. If the observing is done with the right attitude, any object is the right object.\\" Sayadaw Tejaniya places less emphasis on form‚Äîthe sitting posture or the specific method of walking‚Äîrecommending instead a more natural pose closer to how yogis act in real life. In his words, \\"Meditation is not just about sitting on a cushion. No matter what posture you are in, if your mind is aware with understanding, you are meditating.\\" In addition to sati (mindfulness) and viriya (perseverance), the Sayadaw feels it is important for yogis to engage in dhamma vicaya (investigation, analysis) of an almost scientific sort, which he believes is the most productive route to knowledge of the world as it really is. The Sayadaw is particularly concerned with helping yogis build skills they can and will continue to use throughout their lives. Overseas teachings Sayadaw Tejaniya has taught and led meditation retreats in Australia, China, the Czech Republic, Great Britain, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Finland, the United States and Vietnam. His principal writings have been translated into eleven languages. In 2012, Sayadaw traveled to the United States with his translator for a retreat at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre Massachusetts. Over one hundred participants attended, including many noted North American meditation teachers. Publications Sayadaw Tejaniya has published three books drawn from his group interviews with yogis, one collection of brief yogi autobiographies emphasizing how the practice of mindfulness meditation has influenced them (including one by the Sayadaw himself), and two books from a commercial publisher (When Awareness Becomes Natural: A Guide to Cultivating Mindfulness in Everyday Life, 2016, and Relax and Be Aware: Mindfulness Meditations for Clarity, Confidence, and Wisdom, 2019). Many of Sayadaw Tejaniya's question-and-answer exchanges with yogis about their practice, which combine elements of traditional Dhamma talks and interviews, are available online.

It is approximately 30 miles north of Yellowstone National Park. Beginning in 1900, the natural hot springs has been gradually turned into a vacation resort.  Location  Chico Hot Springs is located at , el. and resides in Park County, Montana, in Paradise Valley.  Hot springs  The hot springs are associated with a deep fracture zone, it is not clear if they related to the nearby Yellowstone Hot Spot. The hot mineral water emerges from the ground at 113¬∞F (45¬∞C), at 37 gallons per minute. Currently, there are a couple of developed pools that collect the water from the springs for the use of paying resort guests. These private pools range in temperature from 104 degrees Fahrenheit to 96 degrees Fahrenheit depending on the geothermal activity.  History  Native Americans were the first people to use the Hot Springs; they primarily used it for bathing and laundry. On Jan 16, 1865, John S. Hackney, a miner, wrote, \\"I went out to the hot springs and washed my dirty 'duds.\\" This was the first recorded writing about the Hot Springs. By the year 1876, the hot water was used for different purposes. Mr. Randall, also a miner, erected some hot houses for a garden he had planted. The hot water that flowed underneath his crops provided a prime growing environment. In 1900, Bill and Percie Knowles, built Chico Warm Springs Hotel. The inn consisted of a 'plunge' pool and a full service dining area. Mr. Knowles operated the hotel until his death on April 22, 1910. This left the widow Percie Knowles in charge of the hotel operations. Under her guidance, the hotel continued to flourish. She hired a physician named Dr. George A. Townsend in June 1912 who promoted the healing properties of the thermal spring water that allegedly cured internal ailments such as kidney disease, as well as relieved rheumatism, and external ailments such as skin problems. The doctor's fame spread at such a rate that the resort needed additional boarding. By 1916, a hospital wing of 20 rooms was added on to the hotel. On July 1, 1925, Dr. Townsend left his services at the Hot Springs behind, leaving Mrs. Knowles to run the hotel on her own. By the early 1930s, the hospital wing had been torn down due to decreasing business at the hotel. These challenging times took their toll on Mrs. Knowles' health, and she left the operations in the late 1930s. She was diagnosed with mental illness and sent to a state hospital where she died. Her son Radbourne and his wife Agnes Sophia took over the business. They sold the business in 1948. In the years following, the property became a guest ranch, road house, church camp, as well as other uses.  Current times  All of the original buildings have deteriorated or been torn down, with the exception of the historic inn. Owners Mike and Eva Art rebuilt the property in 1973 to what it is today. Some of the newer buildings consist of modern looking cabins and suites. During the years the Art's owned the property there were several famous guests including Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Dennis Quaid, Jeff Bridges and George McGovern. The organic garden produces fresh herbs and vegetables year round from \\"the geothermally heated greenhouse, built in 1996.\\" In 2016, the Arts sold Chico to the property's long-time manager Colin Davis in 2016. In June 2014 officials from the Department of Environmental Quality detected a groundwater seep from a hillside near the resort. To mitigate the possibility of pathogens from the surface water seep entering the aquifer water, they issued a boil water order. A filtration system was installed for drinking water, and the seep did not seem to effect the hot springs water quality.

The coup started in the evening with military personnel and equipment making its way onto the streets, followed by the state-owned media being taken off-air. Both second-round candidates and the incumbent president were initially arrested by the junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, said that one of the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future. An interim government was tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime. Background The media and international think-tanks have highlighted the country's instability and labelled it a narcostate. The country has frequently featured military involvement in civil administration since independence. As such, the events leading up to the 2012 coup include military unrest in 2010 and a failed coup attempt in 2011. The latter followed infighting between the country's Navy and the Army. Guinea-Bissau's instability is also exacerbated as a transit point for drug shipments from Latin America to Europe and there are allegations that government ministers and military personnel are bribed to keep silent. Following the death of President Malam Bacai Sanh√° on 9 January 2012, a new election was scheduled to be held within 90 days in accordance with the constitution. Despite a peaceful campaign, there were external fears of possible violence or a coup d'√©tat if the army did not approve of the winner. In this regard, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for a \\"peaceful, orderly and transparent\\" election. Just before the attack, presidential candidate Kumba Ial√°, who claimed to have ties with members of his Balanta ethnic group, who are the largest ethnicity in the military, warned of \\"consequences\\" if there was campaigning for the second round of the election due to his allegations of fraud in the first round that were unanswered. The first round result was rejected by five of the nine candidates. Campaigning was due to start on 13 April for the second round, until its disruption as a result of the coup d'√©tat. Days before the coup, fellow Lusophone country Angola announced its forces would be ending the two-year-old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed effort by the European Union as part of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). State-owned Angolan news agency ANGOP said that the Angolan troops were sent to Guinea-Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces. On 16 April, Guinea-Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Ara√∫jo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart C√¢ndido Pereira dos Santos Van-D√∫nem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School (ESG) and the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes J√∫nior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution. Rationale According to Portugal's SIC Not√≠cias, a day before the coup an unidentified military commander claimed Gomes J√∫nior would allow Angolan troops into the country. He also claimed that soldiers possessed a \\"secret document\\" that allowed the Guinea-Bissau government to sanction an Angolan attack on Guinea- Bissau's military. The leaders of the junta released an unsigned communique that read they \\"did not have ambitions of power\\" and that the coup was a reaction to the alleged agreement with Angola because the 200 military trainers would \\"annihilate Guinea-Bissau's armed forces.\\" The spokesman for the junta that took over after the coup, Lieutenant-Colonel Daha Bana na Walna later said that Gomes J√∫nior and Pereira were ousted because of \\"unease\\" in the armed forces over the election, a sentiment echoed by diplomats. Gomes Junior was also viewed as the \\"candidate of Angola\\" in the election, according to Chatham House's Africa director Alex Vines. He also said that the months leading up to the events featured media commentary and hostility towards Angola. Coup d'etat Presidential candidate Carlos Gomes J√∫nior's house was attacked during the coup and he was later arrested. On 12 April, gunfire was heard between 19:00 and 21:00, as mutinous troops attempted to overthrow the government by seizing control of the centre of the capital Bissau. Initial reports by diplomats in the country said presidential candidate Carlos Gomes J√∫nior and interim President Raimundo Pereira were missing. The mutineers seized control of the offices of the incumbent African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and radio stations. They also fought police officers loyal to the government, forcing them to retreat after coming under fire from RPGs. The soldiers blocked the roads into and out of the capital city and the national radio and television was taken off-air at 20:00. The perpetrators of the coup targeted Gomes J√∫nior's residence, which was attacked by grenades and surrounded by troops, as gunfire was heard nearby. Journalists were also prevented from approaching the scene. Camilo Lima da Costa, the son of the head of the national election commission Desejado Lima da Costa, told RDP √Åfrica, one of the radio stations still broadcasting, that the soldiers had looted his father's house but that both his parents were safe. Soldiers ransacked and looted other houses they raided as well. Soldiers also sealed off the embassies to prevent members of the government from fleeing and hiding with foreign diplomats. Several unnamed politicians were arrested during the night by the army. Peter Thompson, the head of the U.K. Electoral Observation Mission in the country for the election, described the situation on the night of the coup as \\"a very large presence of the military in the streets. It did seem quite coordinated last night in terms of how the roads were shut off...Today the streets are very calm, the city is much quieter than it normally would be. People are staying home. I do know that the army has taken control of the state media and state television, and they haven't released anything official.\\" There was speculation on Senegal's RFM radio by reporter Noah Mankali that Gomes J√∫nior had been assassinated by the army during the night by soldiers from the same Balanta ethnic group as Ial√° Embal√≥. Interim President Raimundo Pereira, who was also arrested during the coup An unnamed number of government ministers, as well as the Director General of the Judicial Police Jo√£o Biague, were in hiding. Interior Minister Fernando Gomes, who may have been in the custody of the mutinous soldiers, said he \\"feared for his life.\\" On 14 April, Lusa journalist Antonio Aly Silva told the outlet that he had been arrested for a short while, but was later released at the same time as singer Dulce Neves and many of Gomes Junior's bodyguards. Senegal closed its land border with Guinea- Bissau on 13 April. People began to venture out of their homes at dawn and there appeared to be little to no presence of soldiers on the streets and no messages over radio or television from either the government or the coup leaders. There was an \\"unusual\\" quiet in Bissau, although photographs showed a big hole in Gomes J√∫nior's residence as a result of the attack. Soldiers were seen standing guard outside radio and television stations, including the state-run television office, and the presidential offices in Bissau. An overnight curfew was imposed the following day with orders for the members of the civilian government to turn themselves over to the army. Private radio stations were also shut. On 14 April, some businesses started to reopen but they closed early in accordance with the curfew. Aftermath and National Unity Government The coup leaders formed the \\"Military Command\\" under the leadership of the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces General Mamadu Ture Kuruma. The next day, they put forth conditions for a national unity government after having announced the ouster of Gomes J√∫nior. Its goals were: the removal of obstacles to reforming the security sector; fighting drug trafficking and consumption; overcoming a culture of impunity; and the continuation of enhancing the democratic process. Interim President Raimundo Pereira and the Chief-of-Staff of the Armed Forces General Antonio Indjai were \\"under the control of the army,\\" however there were rumours circulating that Indjai could be hiding and that soldiers were going to every embassy looking for him. Indjai's spokesman Daba Naualna said that Periera and Gomes J√∫nior were \\"well and alive\\" and added that \\"the [army chief-of-staff] thinks, for the sake of the country, that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have [the military] play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis.\\" The Military Command later announced that they were also holding Ial√° Embal√≥. The detained officials were later released. The UN later reported that the head of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission were also in hiding, along with three unnamed cabinet ministers. Senior officers of the army also met the leaders of the political parties and called on them to form the transitional government, but added that the army would control the defence and interior ministries. The meeting was also attended by: Indjai, who was later arrested; the deputy chief-of-staff General Mamadu Ture Kuruma; the heads of the army, air force and navy; the army's spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Daha Bana na Walna and four colonels. However, there was no one from the incumbent PAIGC. Consultations with 23 parliamentary and extra-parliamentary parties discussed issues such as: a transitional government including, an interim president and head of the National Assembly, as well as a PAIGC-nominated prime minister other than the incumbent and a government of national unity inclusive of all parties; and the dissolution of the National Assembly with a government led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) under interim leadership. The five leading opposition candidates (Mohamed Ial√° Embal√≥, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, Henrique Rosa, Baciro Dj√°, and Vicente Fernandes) announced at a joint news conference that the boycott of the second round of the election would be in the name of \\"justice.\\" Agnela Regalla of Union for Change, who also attended the meeting, said that \\"the military chiefs suggested the idea of new presidential and legislative elections.\\" The spokesman for the coalition of opposition parties, Fernando Vaz, said that discussion continued for a third day and that the grouping had invited PAIGC to participate. After the meeting the coalition agreed upon a set of proposals to put forward to the Military Command for a transitional unity government. There were some small protests supporting Gomes J√∫nior in downtown Bissau, although, according to Peter Thompson, soldiers arrested several of the protesters and put roadblocks on the streets. PAIGC, commenting on the transitional government, said that it \\"rejects any anti-constitutional or anti-democratic proposal of a solution to the crisis,\\" while also calling for the release of those detained. Tensions mounted within PAIGC between factions supporting Gomes J√∫nior and Nhamadjo. On 15 April, a demonstration of about 30 people at the National Assembly, where talks on a transition government were ongoing, was dispersed by soldiers. The National Union of Workers of Guinea-Bissau, which has a membership of about 8,000 mostly civil servants, called for a general strike the next day. On 16 April, an agreement, which intentionally excluded PAIGC, was reached with 22 of the 35 opposition parties to set up a National Transitional Council. According to Vaz, the size, composition and mandate period would be determined the following day and then discussed with the Military Command. He also said that existing institutions would be dissolved and that two committees would run the country, one would manage foreign affairs and the other would handle social affairs. The former committee was due to meet the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) the following day. The transitional civilian government will rule up to two years before new elections will be held. National Assembly speaker Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, who had previously rejected the office of interim president in April 2012, was again selected as interim president on 11 May 2012. Sory Djal√≥ was the speaker of the NTC. Reactions =Domestic= At an ECOWAS summit in Ivory Coast convened to discuss the Malian crisis, Foreign Minister Mamadu Saliu Djal√≥ Pires, upon learning of the events unfolding in his country, called for international support as \\"the situation is serious. The soldiers are occupying the streets. I spoke to the interim Prime Minister [Adiato Djal√≥ Nandigna] and she said she was under fire\\" and added that the international community should have an \\"energetic reaction\\" to the coup. Pires also dismissed claims that Indjai was arrested suggesting that he was, in fact, a part of it (he was also involved in the 2010 military unrest before being appointed chief-of-staff). =International= Supranational During the early hours of the event, the Foreign Minister of Ivory Coast (the host country of ECOWAS) Daniel Kablan Duncan said that the \\"information indicates to us that there is a coup underway. ECOWAS formally and rigorously condemns such an attempted coup d'etat,\\" he added that \\"it's sad that after the example of Senegal, where the elections finished so well, that we have, after Mali, a new forceful intervention in Guinea-Bissau. What I can say at this moment is that...the situation won't be accepted by ECOWAS.\\" ECOWAS Commission President Kadr√© D√©sir√© Ouedraogo issued a statement that read: \\"The commission firmly denounces this latest incursion by the military into politics and unreservedly condemns the irresponsible act, which has once more demonstrated their penchant to maintain Guinea-Bissau as a failed state.\\" ECOWAS later decided to send a contingent of military personnel in order to provide security. The delegation, which would also include civilians, would be led by Guinean President Alpha Cond√©. ECOWAS also said the election runoff should go ahead. ECOWAS constitutes a contact group, chaired by Nigeria and comprising delegations from Benin, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal and Togo, to coordinate its efforts at resolving the crisis. ECOWAS also had a standby force to fill a vacuum that could be left by the departing MISSANG force, as well as considering International Criminal Court recommendations. The United Nations Security Council (which included the former colonial mother country Portugal) unanimously condemned the coup with a resolution that stated \\"the forcible seizure of power from the legitimate government of Guinea-Bissau by some elements of its armed forces. [We] firmly denounce this incursion by the military into politics\\". The President of the UNSC, U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice, said \\"the [UN] Secretariat urged the international community to address the cycle of violence and impunity in Guinea-Bissau\\" and also called for \\"the immediate restoration of civilian authority...[We] note with profound regret that these events are occurring just prior to the launch of the campaign for the second round of the presidential election\\". Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that he was \\"extremely concerned\\" about the arrests of the civilian leadership, while his spokesman Martin Nesirky said that Ki-Moon called for the mutineers \\"to immediately and unconditionally release all detainees and ensure the safety and security of the general population.\\" The UNSC unanimously voted to \\"restore constitutional order\\" in the country and approved Resolution 2048 with sanctions, including issuing travel bans on the diplomatic passports, on five members of the military junta on 18 May. The five members sanctioned were: General Antonio Indjai, Major General Mamadu Ture Kuruma, Inspector-General of the Armed Forces General Est√™v√£o na Mena, Chief of Staff of the Air Force Brigadier General Ibraima Camara and MC spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Daha Bana na Walna. In December, the UNSC expressed concern over the transition process back towards civilian administration. The UN recommended steps to ensuring a \\"way forward\\" entailed: mediation between national actors, targeted sanctions on the perpetrators, the deployment of training and protections forces in accordance with the ECOWAS/CPLP road map or the recommendation of the incumbent prime minister and foreign minister for a peacekeeping force. The Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) called an extraordinary meeting to take place in Lisbon on 14 April. The meeting was to be attended by the foreign ministers of the member countries: Angola's Georges Rebelo Chicoti, Brazil's Antonio Patriota, Guinea-Bissau's Mamadou Djalo Pires, Mozambique's Oldemiro Julio Marques Baloi and Portugal's Paulo Portas. The CPLP also condemned the coup and exhorted the UN, African Union (AU) and ECOWAS to work towards restoring the \\"constitutional order\\" of Guinea-Bissau. They further called for a cessation of military actions that threatened the state or the \\"legality\\" of Guinea-Bissau. At the CPLP meet in Lisbon, Pires had said that the \\"persecution is continuing.\\" The CPLP later issued a statement of condemnation and also called for a UN-authorised military intervention saying that it had \\"take[n] the initiative of...forming an interposition force in Guinea-Bissau, with a mandate defined by the United Nations Security Council\\" that would seek to maintain \\"constitutional order, protect civilians and the country's legitimate institutions.\\" It added that it supported the Angolan presence in the country and the initiate would be carried out according to consultations with ECOWAS, the AU and the EU. Rifts developed between ECOWAS and CPLP over the resolution mechanisms. The former, supported by Nigeria, Senegal, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, advocated a year-long transitional process; while the later, supported by Portugal and Angola, advocated an immediate resumption of the election. The African Union Commission's chairperson Jean Ping said that he condemned the \\"outrageous acts which undermine the efforts to stabilise the situation in Guinea-Bissau and tarnish the image of the country and Africa.\\" In mid-May, Guinea-Bissau was suspended from the AU. A spokesman for the European Union's High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said that \\"the EU has already suspended most of its aid to Guinea-Bissau\\" and called on the Military Command to release the detained leaders and restore the \\"legitimate government.\\" Ekmeleddin ƒ∞hsanoƒülu, the Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, called the coup a \\"heinous and unacceptable act\\", adding that it would hinder security and the democratic process as it had occurred weeks before the runoff. He also called for the detained politicians to be released. Meanwhile, on 24 April the African Union Peace and Security Council ministerial meeting met at its headquarters in Addis Ababa to discuss matters pertaining to resolving the crisis in the country. States Angolan Defense Minister C√¢ndido Pereira dos Santos Van-D√∫nem said that Angola will \\"continue to provide full support [to Guinea-Bissau because of] excellent ties,\\" adding that the withdrawal date for the troops was being discussed. On 1 October, the UN Ambassador Ismael Abraao Gaspar Martins said that it was seeking a solution to \\"normalisation of constitutional order\\" through the work of the UNSC, AU, CPLP and ECOWAS. Angola's Lusa reported that Portugal, the former coloniser, issued advisories to its citizens to stay in their homes It also rejected claims of an \\"untoward\\" attitude by Angola. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that \\"the Portuguese government is appealing for a halt to the violence and respect for the law.\\" Portas later called for the detained civilian leadership to be released. Defence Minister Jos√© Pedro Aguiar-Branco said that the Portuguese military was ready to evacuate its citizens. \\"It is our responsibility and our job to ensure adequate preparedness in the event that the evacuation be necessary.\\" Portugal also issued a travel warning for its citizens. On 15 April, it was announced that two naval vessels and an aircraft were on their way to somewhere in West Africa ready for a possible evacuation of 4,000‚Äì5,000 Portuguese citizens. On 1 October, Portugal's UN Ambassador Jos√© Filipe Moraes Cabral echoed the statement of Angola at the same meeting. Fellow Lusophone countries Brazil and Timor Leste also reacted to the events, with Brazil's Ministry of External Relations expressing their \\"preoccupation\\" with the events and saying that it would call for an extraordinary meeting of the UNSC to discuss the issue. Timor Leste's President Jos√© Ramos-Horta said that \\"the situation in Guinea-Bissau, which I have followed over the years, is extraordinarily complex, dangerous, because it can degrade into more violence, and the country is not in a position to afford that new setback in the peace process and its democratisation.\\" He also offered to mediate the crisis. His offer was accepted on 16 April. Guinean Foreign Minister Edouard Niankoye Lama called for \\"restoration of peace and stability\\" and of \\"all democratic institutions,\\" when speaking at the General debate of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf also criticised the \\"unconstitutional unraveling, of democratic governments\\" at the UNGA. Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba said at the UNGA General debate that he denounced the \\"unconstitutional changes\\" and praised ECOWAS for its work in trying to resolve the issue. Nigeria also condemned the coup and President Goodluck Jonathan also told the UNGA General debate: \\"Guinea-Bissau is another flash point of instability in the sub-region in which Nigeria and ECOWAS are engaged. Indeed, the Contact Group, headed by Nigeria was set up by the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS to help establish a transitional government with a view to returning that country to political and constitutional order. In furtherance of this objective, Nigeria provided the sum of 10 million US dollars to the Interim Government in Guinea-Bissau to assist in the stabilisation of the country.\\" Russia called for the restoration of the civilian government. Canada condemned the coup; while the United States' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, \\"We call for the release of all government leaders and urge all parties to reconcile their differences through the democratic process.\\" The United States' embassy issued a statement that read: \\"It is regrettable that elements of the Bissau-Guinean military have chosen to derail the democratic process in Guinea-Bissau.\\" At a daily press briefing, the State Department spokesman Mark Toner called on all sides to the conflict to \\"put down their weapons, release government leaders immediately and restore legitimate civilian leadership,\\" adding that it \\"appeared the junta had taken control of media outlets, as they were off-air and the headquarters of PAIGC and were trying to restrict movement\\" and that \\"we regret that they have chosen to disrupt the democratic process, which already was challenged by the opposition's call to boycott the second round of elections.\\" The State Department also issued a travel warning to the country and called on its citizens already in the country \\"to shelter in place and avoid the downtown area of Bissau.\\" Subsequent apolitical events On 9 June, the last police and armed forces personnel of the MISSANG mission left the country. In late August, the Commissioner for Natural resources, Environment and Rural Development Ibraima Dieme announced the Union had approved a loan of 15 billion CFA francs to the country for security system reforms. However, the spokesman of the transitional government, Fernando Vaz, also announced that an agreement with Angola Bauxite to build a deepwater port so as to export bauxite would need to be renegotiated as \\"the agreement signed in 2007 by the government of Carlos Gomes Junior is not fair ... As a result, the terms of the agreement must be reviewed. The transitional government will not accept that Bissau receives 10 percent [of revenues] while Angola Bauxite takes 90 percent.\\" The project, which had been inaugurated in July 2011, had previously stalled prior to the coup as a result of concern over political instability and an environmental impact study that had not yet been published despite passing the deadline. If completed the port at Buba would have a capacity to host three 70-tonne vessels at any given time, while the project as a whole would also lead to the creation of a three million tonne-a-year mine in Boe. By the end of the year The New York Times reported an increase in drug trafficking in the country and thus calling the events \\"cocaine coup;\\" it also cited a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration employee as saying the country is \\"probably the worst narco-state that's out there on the continent. [Guinea-Bissau is] a major problem [for the U.S.A.]. People at the highest levels of the military are involved in the facilitation [of trafficking]. In other African countries government officials are part of the problem. In Guinea-Bissau, it is the government itself that is the problem.\\" A sentiment echoed by regional UN staff. The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for West and Central Africa Pierre Lapaque also said: \\"There has clearly been an increase in Guinea-Bissau in the last several months. We are seeing more and more drugs regularly arriving in this country;\\" while the EU's ambassador to the country Joaquin Gonzalez-Ducay added: \\"As a country it is controlled by those who formed the coup d'√©tat. They can do what they want to do. Now they have free rein.\\" Continued political instability On 21 October, soldiers again attacked an army barracks in what The New York Times said was a coup attempt against the interim government. It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the counter-coup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions that he was the power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: \\"People say I'm a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs.\\" Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: \\"I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking.\\" The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: \\"You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are the people who came in to pick up the pieces after the coup.\\" His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police Jo√£o Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that \\"The traffickers know [our judicial authority] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give up because they have nothing to eat.\\" Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: \\"A country that's not capable of discussing its own problems ‚Äì it's not a country, it's not a state.\\" The leader of the coup attempt was Pansau Ntchama, a commando who was the ex-bodyguard of Guinea-Bissau's former army chief of staff. Fernando Vaz said of him: \\"He is a man with political ambitions living in Portugal. He appeared here in order to carry out this attempted coup ... He flew to Gambia, and then he went to Angola to pick up arms ... He has fled into the bush, but we are confident that we will catch him.\\" =Resolution process= In response to the UNSC resolution for the restoration of civilian and constitutional rule, Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon appointed Timor-Leste's Jose Ramos-Horta as his special representative to the country on 31 January 2013, replacing Rwanda's Joseph Mutaboba.

Howell (born September 28, 1953) is an American politician from Utah. He was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate from Utah in the 2000 and 2012 elections.  Early life, education and professional life  Scott was born in Provo, Utah. He grew up in Salt Lake City in a neighborhood with many prominent civic and ecclesiastical leaders, and he maintains close relationships with many of these people to this day. Scott attended Dixie State College in Southern Utah on a football scholarship, and he graduated from the University of Utah in Political Science. After graduation, Scott went to work with IBM, where he advanced through the years until he became the director of Global System Integrators/Channel Strategies and the Executive of IBM Public Sector operations. In these roles, he helped governments worldwide increase effectiveness and efficiency through information technology. In 2003 Scott completed a year of Harvard Executive Education to become an \\"IBM Certified Professional.\\" In 2006 Scott completed the IBM certification and became a \\"Master Deal Maker,\\" which was taught at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Internationally, Scott was a \\"Smart Communities\\" advocate, working to shape the future of the world's community governments in today's global technology revolution. In this role, he consulted with the governments of Australia, Japan, Italy, and Latvia. He and his wife, Linda, are the parents of four sons.  Political career  Howell served in the Utah State Senate for three terms, including eight years as the Senate Democratic Leader. Under his guidance, Utah became one of the first states to utilize on-line government services, such as vehicle registration. In addition, he drew on his experience in business to make improvements in health care, transportation, public safety, and tax reform. A \\"life long learner\\" advocate, Scott used his skills to create solutions to the challenges of education. He championed the cause by passing great legislation to bring millions of dollars of technology equipment to the classroom, reduce class size, and have kindergarten as an important part of the public school agenda. Legislative committee assignments included Health and Human Services, Education, Government Innovation, Transportation, and Olympic Sports Authority. Senator Howell was a ranking member of the \\"Executive Appropriations Committee,\\" in charge of fiscal appropriations of Utah's $1.3 billion annual budget. =2012 U.S. Senate election= At the Utah Democratic Convention on April 21, 2012 - Howell triumphed over challenger Pete Ashdown to secure the Utah Democratic Party's nomination for the U.S. Senate race against the incumbent senator, Orrin Hatch, Utah's six-term senator seeking his seventh. Howell did this after securing 63% of the vote at the convention in Salt Palace Convention Center. During his pre-convention campaign, Howell emphasized his electability, highlighting his position as a conservative Democrat who possessed the same socially conservative values as Utah voters. Howell's 2012 campaign is running on three platforms: energy, education and the economy. In August 2012, Howell accused Hatch of \\"Ducking Debates,\\" because Hatch failed to show up for debates against him and other candidates running in the 2012 U.S. Senate Race. Howell was quoted in the article as saying, \\"I believe he thinks the best way to keep his job is to not let people see they have a choice. I think he [Hatch] knows people will see that I'm the candidate that represents Utah the best.\\", Salt Lake City Tribune A few days later, the Salt Lake Tribune published an article calling for Hatch to be debating his opponents, \\"Utah voters deserve to see and hear the candidates air their differences up close.\\" The article also referenced Hatch in his 1976 campaign by saying, \\"Hatch should agree to several debates well before voters have to make up their minds. Hatch thought that would be fair when he was trying to unseat an incumbent 36 years ago.

This includes but is not limited to participating in Relay for Life, Dance Marathon, and ushering at musical performances. Every chapter of Nu Kappa Epsilon has the opportunity to choose their own philanthropy to support, as long as it is music-related. The various chapters currently raise funds and awareness for organizations which include, but are not limited to: the Out of the Darkness Walk, Guitars Not Guns, Relay for Life, Letters for Soldiers, and the Songs for Kids Foundation.  Expansion  Since its founding in 1994, NKE has established three subsequent chapters. The Vice President of Nu Kappa Epsilon's founding, Alpha chapter is responsible for the Nationals budget, which may be used for a NKE conference or for expansion activities. Female students with an interest in music at any accredited college or university are eligible to found a chapter of Nu Kappa Epsilon, in conjunction with Nationals at the College of William & Mary.  Connection to Sigma Alpha Iota  Nu Kappa Epsilon was founded in an attempt to garner attention from the International Music Fraternity for Women, Sigma Alpha Iota (SAI). However, upon being offered colony status by SAI, NKE officers made the decision that the transition would involve the loss of sisters who did not meet certain music class requirements of SAI. In an effort to maintain its founding purpose and inclusiveness, NKE chose to remain separate from SAI.

His main theoretical contribution in that field is in the development of the neo- pragmatic peace research approach, where knowledge produced serves practical peace activities and creates social realities useful for peace (Kivim√§ki 2012a). Recently Kivim√§ki's contribution to peace research scholarship has been focused on the creation of understanding on the relative peace in East Asia (Kivim√§ki 2012bc: Kivim√§ki 2011ab). Kivim√§ki's scholarship has also tried to explain the contribution to peace and democracy of forceful democracy- promotion (Kivim√§ki 2012d; 2011c).  Peace work  In addition to academic work, Professor Kivim√§ki has been actively involved in practical peace work, advising parties to peace processes, building capacity to peace negotiation and supporting peace dialogue with academic seminars and research activities. According to a report by the Finnish Embassy, he was, together with a local professor, Dr. Syarif I. Alqadrie, the engine of the West Kalimantan peace process which was eventually, in 2008, taken over by the Vice President of Indonesia. A Report by the Nordic Institute of Asian Studies reveals that this process managed to calm down local election campaigns and prevent escalation in conflict-prone situations. In Aceh Peace Negotiations, Professor Kivim√§ki acted as an adviser to the mediator, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, President Martti Ahtisaari. According to Ahtisaari, Kivim√§ki's role in the process was vitally important.(Demari August 18, 2005) = Espionage conviction and controversy = In addition to his work in Indonesian peace processes, Kivim√§ki has worked in various contracts in assistance of foreign ministries of Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and Russia. Furthermore, he has worked with EU and UN organizations and several other donor agencies and Non- Government Organizations (NGOs) promoting strategies of conflict prevention and peace dialogue. In October 2004, he was ‚Äústrongly advised‚Äù by a Danish intelligence official either to stop his meetings with the Aceh rebel organization, or if he continued meetings, he would have to provide reports on them to the Danish Security and Intelligence Service. Dr. Kivim√§ki declined and continued his meetings (interview with a Malaysian diplomat, who had heard about the demand from Dr. Kivim√§ki in summer 2005). In September 2010 Dr Kivim√§ki was arrested (and released in 24 hours) on a suspicion of helping espionage organization of Russia.http://polsci.ku.dk/english/staff/Detaljer/?id=284208&f;=2Professor i Danmark anklages for spionasjeProfessor mist√¶nkt for spionageSuomalaisprofessoria syytet√§√§n vakoilusta TanskassaPolitiken: Tanskan oikeusministeri√∂ vaatii vakoiluoikeudenk√§ynnin suljetuksi According to Kivim√§ki himself, his work with the Russian foreign ministry was similar to his work with other ministries and that the diplomats he worked with were not spies.http://www.information.dk/298261 His work for the Russian foreign ministry consisted of short studies that explored research-based support for example for Russian diplomatic arguments against militaristic counter- terrorism of the United States and its allies (including Denmark) and military interventions in Iraq, and the potential intervention in Iran. Kivim√§ki had refused to help Russians in their arguments of their position in the negotiation on the territorial disputes in the Arctic. However, Kivim√§ki offered to organize scholarly seminars on the topic in order to help the initiation of political negotiation on the topic (Kai Byman: ‚ÄúRauhanmies H√§pe√§paalussa‚Äù,YLE documentary, September 27, 2012). The Court in Glostrup, Denmark, concluded in its public version of the verdict, after a hearing that was secret not only to the public, but, in part, also to the defendant (double closed doors hearings), that the Russians Dr. Kivim√§ki had collaborated with were diplomats (rather than spies), but that information that Kivim√§ki delivered in his discussions with these diplomats, if passed to the Russien intelligence organization, could have helped the intelligence organization. Thus the court convicted Kivim√§ki under the paragraph 108 of the Danish criminal code (public version). Kivim√§ki was not charged for delivering secrets to Russians (article 107). He served his 2 ¬Ω months home arrest in autumn 2012. His sentence was controversial and for example the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland said in an interview to the biggest Newspaper in Finland (Helsingin Sanomat 13.4. 2012) that Kivim√§ki's activities would not have given rise to legal proceedings in Finland, and that the Foreign Minister could not see with certainty that Prof. Kivim√§ki's legal rights were protected in Denmark. According to a University of Helsinki representative the peace negotiators need contacts with all the conflict parties and big nations.Katja Bargum \\"Rauhantutkija tarvitsee yhteyksi√§ University of Helsinki, April 14, 2012 In Finnish: V√§litysty√∂ edellytt√§√§ yhteydenpitoa kaikkiin osapuoliin ja suurvaltoihin. According to Prof. Liisa Laakso of the Faculty of Social Sciences Dean of the University of Helsinki, scholars are often more suitable for the creation of the initial contacts that are needed for official peace negotiation and conflict resolution between official representatives of the conflicting parties. = Current activities = After the controversy in Denmark, Dr. Kivim√§ki moved back to his native Finland, and took up a faculty position at the University of Helsinki. He has recently published a book examining the relationship between academic research and peace work (Kivim√§ki 2012a) in which he also briefly touches on the subject of how intelligence communities can block or support peace processes. Since moving to Finland his activities have been focused on purely academic issues, and he is teaching and further developing the theory of pragmatic peace research giving a new generation of peace activists new ideas on how to help the crucial initial phase of dialogue between conflicting parties. He is also a frequent commentator of issues related to peace and conflict in the Finnish media. His book is entitled The Long Peace of East Asia.  Selected publications  * Kivimaki, Timo (2016a).

Passengers details were to be checked against terror and criminal watch lists before being stored on the e-borders database. Due to European law on free movement EU carriers and ports supply information to the UK Border Agency on a voluntary basis; however in March 2012 Damian Green said that by April e-Borders would be collecting information on all passengers on 100% of non-EEA flights to the UK. The information of the passengers and crew was to be collected by the airline, train operating company, ferry and other carriers and ports and is then passed on to the e-Borders programme via the Carrier Gateway provided by Serco. In 2014 it was announced that the system would be scrapped. Under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998 passengers and crew may request to view all their records held by the e-Borders programme via the UK Border Agency website.  History  The project was brought in by the then Labour government in 2007. It was hoped that information on all passengers entering and leaving the UK could be achieved by 2014. The project which is provided by the Trusted Borders consortium led by Raytheon and includes Serco, Detica, Accenture and Qinetiq. Raytheon had its contract terminated in July 2010 after a series of delays after being paid ¬£188 million of its ¬£742 million contract and was later replaced by IBM. However the e-Borders programme suffered further delays after Raytheon's contract was terminated as sea and rail passengers are still not covered by e-Borders. In March 2014 Charles Montgomery, Director General of the UK‚Äôs Border Force, announced before the Home Affairs Select Committee, that the e-Borders programme would be terminated. The search for a new supplier has been underway since 2013.

Main combatants comprised: *The Royal Lao Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es du Royaume), best known by its French acronym FAR, were the official armed defense forces of the Kingdom of Laos from 1959 to 1975. Subordinated to the Ministry of Defense of the Royal Lao Government at the capital Vientiane, the FAR branches were organized as follows: ** Royal Lao Army (French: Arm√©e Royale du Laos ‚Äì ARL) ** Royal Lao Air Force (French: Aviation Royale Laoti√®nne ‚Äì AVRL) ** Royal Lao Navy (French: Marine Royale Laoti√®nne ‚Äì MRL) *Paramilitary security forces: ** Royal Lao Police (French: Police Royale Laoti√®nne ‚Äì PRL) ** Directorate of National Coordination (DNC) Security Agency; a.k.a. Border Police (French: Police de Frontiers), active from 1960 to 1965. To meet the threat represented by the Pathet Lao insurgency, the Laotian Armed Forces depended on a small French military training mission (French: Mission Militaire Fran√ßaise pr√®s du Gouvernment Royale du Laos ‚Äì MMFI-GRL),Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), pp. 24; 33. headed by a general officer, an exceptional arrangement permitted under the 1955 Geneva Accords, as well as covert assistance from the United States in the form of the Programs Evaluation Office (PEO), established on 15 December 1955, replaced in 1961 by the Military Assistance Advisory Group (Laos), which was later changed in September 1962 into the Requirements Office.Ahern, Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos (2006), pp. 52; 55. Between 1962 and 1971, the U.S. provided Laos with direct military assistance, but not including the cost of equipping and training irregular and paramilitary forces by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Castle, At War in the Shadow of Vietnam (1993), pp. 9-12; 15-19. In addition to U.S. covert support, the FAR received further military assistance from the United Kingdom, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, the Republic of China (Taiwan), South Vietnam, Indonesia, and Australia; *The Neutralist Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes ‚Äì FAN), a dissident splinter faction of the FAR led by Captain (later, Major general) Kong Le, active from 1961 to 1966, which received support from North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and Indonesia;Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960‚Äì75 (1989), p. 5. *The irregular Anti-communist Special Guerrilla Units (SGU), also collectively referred to as the \\"Secret Army\\" (French: Arm√©e Secr√©te), recruited from Laos' ethnic minorities such as the Hmong (Meo), Lao Theung (Hune) and Lao Sung hill tribes, was led by Royal Lao Government Minister Touby Lyfoung, Major general Vang Pao and Brigadier general Thao Ty. Created from irregular ethnic auxiliary units (French: Suppletifs) raised earlier by the French during the First Indochina War, the SGUs were in reality secretly organized, trained and armed by the CIA since the late 1950s and early 1960s;Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), pp. 97‚Äì99.

An eclectic variety of weapons was used by all sides in the Laotian Civil War. Laotian regular FAR and FAN and irregular SGUs weaponry in the early days of the war was a hodgepodge, with most of their combat units equipped in a haphazard way with an array of French, American, Australian, British, and German weapon systems, mostly of WWII-vintage, either drawn from First Indochina War stocks handed down by the French or secretly provided by the Americans.Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), p. 30.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), pp. 3-4. After 1955 however, the FAR began the process of standardisation on U.S. equipment, with its airborne and infantry units first taking delivery of semi-automatic and automatic small-arms of WWII/Korean War-vintage in late 1959, followed by the delivery between 1963 and 1971 of more modern military equipments, which included aircraft, armored and transport vehicles, and long-range artillery pieces. In 1969 secret deliveries of modern U.S. small-arms arrived in Laos, and were initially only given to the Laotian Royal Guard and airborne units; standardisation in U.S. fully-automatic infantry weapons in the RLA and the irregular SGUs was completed by 1971, replacing much of the older weaponry.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), pp. 15-21.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), p. 59. Captured infantry weapons of Soviet and Chinese origin were also employed by elite commando or airborne units and the irregular SGUs while on special operations in the enemy-held areas of north-eastern and south-eastern Laos.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), pp. 41-42.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), pp. 10; 18; 34. During the early phase of the war, the Pathet Lao likewise was largely equipped with WWII-vintage French, Japanese, American, British, German, Chinese, and Czechoslovakian weapons either pilfered from French colonial forces during the First Indochina War, seized from Laotian FAR units or provided by the Vietminh and subsequently by North Vietnam. As the war progressed, these obsolete weapons began to be partially superseded by more modern Eastern Bloc military hardware, including semiautomatic and fully automatic small-arms, artillery pieces, armored and transport vehicles, and aircraft of Soviet, Chinese and Hungarian origin, mostly being channelled via the North Vietnamese. Although the Pathet Lao standardized on Soviet and Chinese weapons and equipment by the early 1970s, its guerrilla forces continued to make use of captured enemy stocks until the end of the war.

Smith Department of Neurosurgery and the Department of Neurology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth. Located in Houston, the Institute draws patients from around the world for specialized treatment of diseases of the brain and spine. It was the first center in Texas and one of only a few institutions in the country to fully integrate neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, spine surgery, pain medicine and neurorehabilitation.  Specialties  As the first stroke program in Texas to meet The Joint Commission‚Äôs rigorous standards for Comprehensive Stroke Center certification, the Institute stands among an elite group of providers focused on complex stroke care. This comprehensive, integrated approach led to the creation of the Southwest's leading epilepsy program, a highly ranked neurotrauma program, a cerebrovascular center where affiliated physicians treat more aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations than any other center in the region, an established pediatric neurosurgery program in collaboration with Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a spinal neurosurgery and reconstructive peripheral nerve surgery program and a Brain Tumor Center where physicians diagnose and treat hundreds of new tumor patients each year. Affiliated physicians are also innovators in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, movement disorders, neurocognitive disorders, memory disorders and dementia, neuromuscular disorders, chronic pain and traumatic brain injury. = Innovation at the Institute = Mischer Neuroscience Institute has a strong history of firsts: * The first center to discover a genetic mutation linked to intracranial aneurysms. * The first stroke program in Texas and the only one in the region to meet The Joint Commission's rigorous standards for Comprehensive Stroke Center certification.

Purpose  The Trust claims it is possible to change sexuality and offers \\"psycho-therapeutic\\" conversion therapy for homosexual behaviour and feelings. Core Issues Trust states it believes human sexuality in both men and women is a choice; and that sexual preference can and should be changed. The Trust says it does not consider homosexuality a native human behavior, but rather a relational or sexual \\"damage\\" that causes \\"deviancy\\" that it may be \\"cured\\". The group's leader, Dr. Mike Davidson defines himself as ex-gay.High Court hears 'ex-gay' ad ban 'a political issue'  Activities  In June 2011, the Core Issues Trust organized a one-day event in a church in Belfast entitled \\"Interrogating the Pejoratives: Considering Therapeutic Approaches and Contexts for those Conflicted in Sexual Identity\\". Some of the topics on the agenda were \\"How parents can help their children avoid homosexuality\\" and \\"A Christian and psychological perspective on overcoming obstacles to freedom from homosexuality\\". Gay rights groups protested against the Church of Ireland that the event being held in one of the country's churches. In April, 2012, the organization received media coverage following a public campaign, which included advertisements on London buses claiming that therapy could change sexual orientation, and with the message Not gay! Ex-gay, post-gay and proud. Get over it!. Although the campaign was passed by the Committee of Advertising Practice, it was subsequently banned by then- London Mayor Boris Johnson.Yahoo News - Gay Cure Bus Advert BannedThe Guardian, April 13, 2012 - Boris Johnson bans 'gay cure' bus adverts The Trust lost an appeal at the Court of Appeal against the ban, though secured a review of the Mayor's actions. The Trust lodged a further case in the High Court in January 2014 alleging that Johnson had unlawfully used his position to ban the ad. The Court ruled against the Trust, stating that the decision had been made by the Transport for London Board. In 2018, the Trust released the documentary Voices of the Silenced which followed 15 gay and lesbian people going through conversion therapy. The documentary was criticized by LGBT rights charity Stonewall, who stated \\"LGBT people aren't ill. Being gay, lesbian, bi or trans is not something that should be 'cured' or changed.\\" Humanists UK stated it contained \\"outdated religious views about sin and sexuality\\". In 2019, the Core Issues Trust produced and promoted the film Once Gay: Matthew and Friends about the X Factor Malta contestant Matthew Grech who announced his renunciation of homosexuality on television. Mike Davidson argued that individuals have the right to \\"leave unwanted homosexual practices\\" if they want to. The film sparked outrage worldwide. Afterwards, Matthew Grech stated in an interview that he still identified as gay. In May 2020, the National Secular Society lobbied the Northern Ireland Executive over the charitable status of the group, writing \\"Bogus therapies which encourage people to change or suppress their sexuality are harmful and widely discredited.

For most of the 5th century BC, the Roman Republic had been allied with the other Latin states and the Hernici to successfully fend off the Aequi and the Volsci. In the early 4th century BC, this alliance fell apart. A war fought between Rome and the Hernici in the years 366 - 358 BC ended in Roman victory and the submission of the Hernici. Rome also defeated a rebellion by some Hernician cities in 307 - 306 BC. The rebellious Hernici were incorporated directly into the Roman Republic, while those who had stayed loyal retained their autonomy and nominal independence. In the course of the following century, the Hernici became indistinguishable from their Latin and Roman neighbours and disappeared as a separate people. The foedus Cassianum - 5th century BC From at least the early fifth century BC there were disputes between Rome and the Hernici. In 495 BC, the Hernici joined the Volsci in an unsuccessful invasion of Roman territory.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2:22 In 487 BC, the Hernici again engaged the Romans in battle, and were defeated by the Romans under the leadership of the Roman consul Gaius Aquillius Tuscus.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2:40 In the following year, 486 BC, the Hernici entered into a treaty with Rome. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says the terms were similar to the foedus Cassianum, a mutual military alliance among the Latin cities with Rome as the leading partner.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 8.69.2 However it is unclear whether the Hernici were admitted as a party to that same treaty, or to a separate similar treaty with Rome.Tim Cornell, Rome and Latium to 390 BC, in The Cambridge Ancient History, 2nd ed., vol. VII.2 (Cambridge: CUP 1989), ch. 6, pp. 243-308 at 276 The terms of the treaty included that the Hernici were to cede two thirds of their land.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2:41 Debate about the distribution of that land amongst Romans and the Latin allies caused discord in Rome, which in turn led to the trial and execution in 485 BC of the three-times consul Spurius Cassius Viscellinus for high treason, ironically having been the person who negotiated the treaty with both the Latin allies and the Hernici and for whom the treaty was named.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2:41 While the precise workings of the foedus Cassianum remains uncertain, its overall purpose seems clear. During the 5th century, the Latins were threatened by invasion from the Aequi and the Volsci, as part of a larger pattern of Sabellian-speaking peoples migrating out of the Apennines and into the plains. Fighting is recorded against either the Aequi, the Volsci, or both, almost every year during the first half of the 5th century. This annual warfare would have been dominated by raids and counter-raids rather than the pitched battles described by the ancient sources. During the second half of the 5th century, the Latin-Hernician alliance appears to have stemmed the tide. The sources records the founding of several Roman colonies during this era, while mention of wars against the Aequi and Volsci become less frequent. At the same time, this would lessen the need to maintain the alliance. This was especially true for Rome, which, after her conquest of Veii in 396, was clearly the most powerful state in Latium. Defection of the Hernici - 380s BC Livy writes that in 389, after a hundred years of loyal friendship, the Latins and Hernici defected from Rome in 389, after Rome had been sacked by the Gauls.Livy, 6:2.3-4 Then in 386 and 385 Latin and Hernician men were found fighting for the Volsci.Livy, 6:7.1, 8.4-10, 11.9-10, 12.7-11, & 13.1-8 Rome protested, and refused to hand back their Latin and Hernician prisoners, but did not declare war.Livy, 6:6.2-3, 10.6-9, 14.1, 17.7-8 Livy viewed the sack of Rome by the Gauls as a grave disaster that encouraged Rome's neighbours to rise against her. However, modern historians believe that the ancient historical tradition exaggerate the impact of the sack. Likewise, they disagree with Livy's views that the Hernici defected from Rome; as Livy notes, no open warfare between Rome and the Hernici is recorded for this time period. Rather, the military alliance between Rome and the Latins and Hernici appear to have been allowed to wither. This might have been a conscious policy by Rome to free herself from treaty obligations and so gain wider freedom of action.Cornell, p. 322 However, the Latins and the Hernici, no longer threatened by the Aequi and Volsci, could also have seized the opportunity of the Gallic Sack to abandon their alliance with an increasingly dominating Rome.Oakley, p. 354 While it is possible that this led to some Latin and Hernician warriors fighting for the Volsci, these could also be inventions by Livy to provide a literary motif to his narrative.Oakley, pp. 354, 446-114 Except for these doubtful notices then, no conflicts are recorded between Romans and Hernici until 366 The Hernician War 362 - 358 After some mostly peaceful years, in 362, the Romans went to war against the Hernici, starting a period of unprecedented successful warfare for the Romans.Cornell, p. 324 Livy provides the only narrative account for this Hernican War. In addition, two triumphs and an ovation against the Hernici are recorded in the Fasti Triumphales.Oakley, pp. 3-4 =Outbreak of the war= According to Livy, in 366, it was reported in Rome that the Hernici had rebelled, but nothing was done to prevent any action from being taken by the plebeian consul.Livy, 7:1.3-4 In 363, to ward off pestilence, the Romans nominated L. Manlius Imperiosus dictator to perform the ancient ritual of \\"driving in the nail\\" at the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Manlius, however, attempted to use his appointment to secure command in the war against the Hernici, but, faced with public resentment and resistance from the tribunes of the plebs, he was forced to lay down his office.Livy, 7:3.4-9 After fetials had been sent to the Hernici to demand satisfaction without result, the Roman Assembly in 362 voted for war against the Hernici. L. Genucius Aventinensis became the first plebeian consul to command in war, but the Hernici caught Genucius in an ambush; the consul was killed and the Roman legions routed.Livy, 7:6.1-7 As usual, Livy makes Rome the offended party, but Roman designs on Hernician land might well have been real cause of this war.Oakley, p. 4 The failed levy of L. Manlius is probably not historical, but has likely been invented as a motive for the famous prosecution of L. Manlius, traditionally dated to 362.Oakley, p. 72 =Dictatorship of Appius Claudius Crassus= The surviving patrician consul, Q. Servilius Ahala, then nominated Appius Claudius Crassus as dictator.Livy, 7:6.11-12 Pending the arrival of the dictator, C. Sulpicius Peticus assumed command of the Roman army. The Hernici had surrounded the Roman camp, but, led by Sulpicius, the Romans sortied and forced them to retreat. With the arrival of the dictator with fresh forces from Rome, the strength of the Roman army was doubled. On their side the Hernici called up all their men, and formed a special privileged unit of 3,200 picked men. The Romans and Hernici had camped on each side of a two-mile-broad plain, and the battle took place in the middle. When the Roman cavalry found that they could not break the enemy lines by normal means, they dismounted and charged as infantry. They were countered by the special picked men of the Hernici.Livy, 7:7.1-9 After a hard struggle, the Roman knights got the best of this contest and the Hernici were routed. The next day, the Romans were delayed in attacking the Hernician camp due to difficulty in obtaining favourable omens and consequently failed to take the camp before darkness broke off fighting. During the night, the Hernici abandoned their camp and withdrew. Seeing the retreating Hernici pass by their walls, the people of Signia sallied out and scattered them in flight. Roman casualties had been heavy, a quarter of their whole force, and a considerable number of their cavalry had fallen.Livy, 7:8.1-7 Livy's extended narrative of this campaign is full of standard annalistic features and very little of the detail provided can have been derived from authentic records. The first military command ever held by a plebeian consul and the subsequent dictatorship of the conservative patrician Appius Claudius ties Livy's account into the Struggle of the Orders. Because of this literary character of the episode, and the absence of a triumph for Appius Claudius in the Fasti Triumphales, some historians have rejected Appius Claudius' dictatorship. Oakley(1998) does not consider these arguments decisive, but believes the basic notice of a Roman victory against the Hernici in 362 to be historical, and perhaps also the dictatorship of Appius Claudius and the involvement of Signia as well.Oakley, pp. 4, 103-104 =Rome triumphant= Livy only provides brief narratives for the remaining years of the Hernician war, being more interested in the Gallic wars Rome was fighting at the same time. In 361, the Roman consuls invaded Hernician territory. Finding no enemy in the field, they attacked and took Ferentinum.Livy, 7:9.1 In 360 consul M. Fabius Ambustus received command of the war against the Hernici.Livy, 7:11.2 Fabius defeated the Hernici first in some minor battles and then in a major one where the Hernici attacked in full strength. For his victories, Fabius entered the City of Rome in Ovation.Livy, 7:11.8-9 In 358 the Romans assigned command of the Hernician war to consul C. Plautius Proculus.Livy, 7:12.7 The consul defeated the Hernici and reduced them to submission.Livy, 7:14.10 The Pomptina and Publilia tribes were also formed that year.Livy, 7:15.11 The Fasti Triumphales records a triumph by consul C. Sulpicius Peticus against the Hernici in 361, the ovation of M. Fabius Ambustus in 360, which according to the Fasti took place on 5 September, and the triumph of consul C. Plautius Proculus in 358, which it dates to 15 May. There is no particular reason to doubt the historicity of these Roman victories, though it is unlikely that Livy's description of Fabius first winning several minor battles and then a major battle, perhaps a condensation of a longer account found in his sources, is derived from authentic records.Oakley, p. 4 In 358, the Latins renewed their alliance with Rome when Latium was threatened by invasion from the Gauls. Fear of the Gauls might also have influenced the Hernici to accept a new treaty with Rome,Cornell, p. 324 but the Hernici probably obtained less favourable terms than their old alliance.Cornell, p. 324; Oakley, p. 4 Ferentinum is described as independent in 306, and so must have been handed back to the Hernici at some point, perhaps as part of the peace terms.Oakley, p. 4 Of the two Roman tribes created in 358, the Pomptina was evidently located in the Pomptine on territory Rome had taken from the Volsci. The location of the Publilia is less certain; modern historians generally locate it on territory taken from the Hernici, but it is possible that the Publilia was also located on former Volscian land.Cornell, p. 324; Oakley, p. 4, 175 Final rebellion of the Hernici 307-306 Towards the end of the Second Samnite War, in 307 BC, the Romans found a number of Hernician men among prisoners taken in battle against the Samnites. These were placed under guard in various Latin towns while the Romans investigated whether they had fought for the Samnites voluntarily or had been conscripted. In response, part of the Hernici, under the leadership of the city of Anagnia, rose in rebellion in 306, but were easily defeated by the Romans that same year. As punishment, Anagnia and the other towns that had rebelled were annexed into the Roman Republic, their people becoming civitas sine suffragio. Aletrium, Ferentinum and Verulae were allowed to retain their autonomy and enjoy similar political rights as the Latins.
