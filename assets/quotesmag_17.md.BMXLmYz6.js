It is run by Manx National Heritage. In general, the museum covers 10,000 years the history of the Isle of Man from the Stone Age to the modern era. The museum serves as headquarters of Manx National Heritage. The museum bears no relation to the institution with the same name founded by Trevor Ashe in 1825.  History  The Manx Museum and Ancient Monuments Act of 1886 led to the creation of a nation museum for the Isle of Man with the aim of preserving the island's cultural and historical heritage. Although there had previously been an institution on the Isle of Man named the Manx Museum, founded by entrepreneur, author, and publisher Trevor Ashe in 1825, it has no relation to the Manx Museum run by Manx National Heritage. The Manx Museum is partially housed in the original Noble's Hospital building. The site on Crellin's Hill in Douglas was bequeathed by Rebecca Noble, the wife of philanthropist and businessman Henry Bloom Noble in 1885. Rebecca Noble laid the foundation stone but did not live to see the building officially opened. After the opening of the new Noble's Hospital on Westmoreland Road in 1912, the building lay empty for nearly a decade until the building was handed over to the trustees for the Manx Museum.Papers of the Henry Bloom Noble Trust. Archives Hub. Retrieved 28 September 2020. The Manx Museum opened 2 November 1922 with Philip Moore Callow Kermode as its director. The museum was expanded and was significantly remodelled between 1986–89 and a large extension included a lecture and film theatre, and an art gallery. The museum was officially reopened by Queen Elisabeth II, Lord of Mann in 1989.  Exhibitions  alt= Apart from a number of permanent exhibitions ranging from the archaeological history of the Isle of Man to the natural history collection, several temporary themed exhibitions are shown each year. Every summer an exhibition covering the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races and motorcycle racing is shown. Other recent exhibitions have included This Terrible Ordeal which focused on the experiences of the Manx people in World War I, and the artwork of British artist William Hoggatt.  Visitors  alt= In 2018 Manx National Heritage stated that there were 100,000 visitors each year on average to the Manx Museum.

History The municipality of Vigmostad was established on 1 January 1911, when the old municipality of Nord-Audnedal was divided into Vigmostad (population: 923) and Konsmo (population: 782). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Vigmostad municipality was dissolved, and its area was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Sør-Audnedal and Spangereid to create the new municipality of Lindesnes.

Background  The Arakan Army is a Rakhine insurgent group mainly active in Rakhine State, Myanmar. Several other insurgent groups had already violently clashed with the Myanmar Armed Forces, known officially as the Tatmadaw, earlier in 2015. In the year prior, the Arakan Army had created a settlement near Myanmar's border with Bangladesh, and hundreds of insurgents from the group crossed into Bangladesh. The group was allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade in the region, an area of 8,080 acres in Remakri near the border with only six BGB outposts. Because the region is extremely remote and inaccessible from Bangladesh's side of the border, the Arakan Army managed to gain a foothold in the area. Insurgent groups from Myanmar are often accused of looting the houses of indigenous peoples in Bangladesh, and fueling the drug trade in the border area. Members of the Arakan Army had often entered the locality of Thanchi on horses to replenish their food and materiel. On 14 July 2015, the BGB rescued two Myanmar soldiers captured by the Arakan Army. On 25 August 2015, the BGB confiscated ten horses that were being used by the Arakan Army to transport supplies. Later that day the Arakan Army fired on a BGB patrol team. The Director General of the BGB suspected that the two incidents may have been linked, and that the latter may have been a reprisal attack.  Clash  On 25 August 2015 at 09:30 AM local time, fighting erupted near the village of Boro Modok in Thanchi. The Arakan Army attacked a ten-member BGB patrol team at Baramadak near the Sangu River, and the gunfire exchange continued for five hours. After learning about the incident, the BGB declared a state of emergency in the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Authorities sent a unit of the BGB and two units of the Bangladesh Army as reinforcements to the area to conduct a coordinated operation. On the same day, the Border Guards Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Army, and the Bangladesh Air Force launched a joint operation against the Arakan Army. Two units of army, one unit of the BGB, and one F-7 of the Bangladesh Air Force took part in the operation. Upon request from the Bangladeshi government, the Myanmar government sealed off their side of the border. Initially, the Arakan Army had surrounded and laid siege to the BGB outpost in Boro Modok; however, the insurgents retreated from the area after Bangladeshi reinforcements arrived. Meanwhile, the Taitong Parha Army and the local police conducted joint raids for several hours between the mornings of 25 and 26 August 2015.  Aftermath  Nayek Jakir Hossain of the Barakadam BOP was injured during the gunfight. He was rescued from the area and was sent to the Combined Military Hospital in Chittagong via helicopter. The Arakan Army lost two horses during the exchange of gunfire. According to locals sources, eight to twenty insurgents were injured. The Bangladeshi joint forces later arrested a Burmese citizen and accomplice of the Arakan Army, Ong Owong Rakhain, in Rajsthali Upazila. He had Arakan Army uniforms, laptops, digital cameras, motorcycles and two horses in his possession. Two more people were arrested in the following days. Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, accompanied by BGB Director General Major general Aziz Ahmed, visited the site of the battle the next day. In a statement, the home minister of Bangladesh said that the joint operation would continue until the Arakan Army was neutralised.

Wing is recognized for her well-established research on behavioral treatments of obesity. Dr. Wing's research examined positive outcomes for long-term weight loss as well as halting weight gain in individuals who are currently overweight. This led to an important development in Wing's research which was the layout of a lifestyle intervention for those with diabetes, particularly type 2. Wing graduated with a Ph.D. in Social Relations and later completed her postdoctoral fellowship by 1973. Dr. Wing was a professor at University of Pittsburgh for 25 years. During her time in Pittsburgh she took part in various organizations working on different treatments for diabetes. Currently, Wing is a professor at Brown University as well as the director of research focused on studying weight control. Not only has she dedicated her time to serving on different councils and panels, she has published over 250 peer-reviewed articles. She achieved this while simultaneously mentoring many junior faculty members on her topic of focus. All of these accomplishments have resulted in Wing receiving many awards. Research completed and in progress Rena Wing has been actively researching behavioral treatments of obesity for about forty years. She has examined many aspects of weight loss. Wing has completed research on four different questions examining the health benefits of modest weight loss, how behavioral treatment of obesity can be improved, whether it is possible to prevent weight gain and subsequent obesity, and the characteristics of successful weight loss maintainers. Wing is currently studying successful weight losers comparing those with normal weight controls versus obese weight controls. =Health benefits of modest weight loss= While examining the various health benefits of weight loss, Wing developed an intervention which was ultimately used in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) DPP was a trial which tested the effective differences between lifestyle interventions or metformin, a diabetes medication, and whether these differences were significantly variant on their ability to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. During her research on the health benefits of modest weight loss, Wing recruited more than 3,000 overweight patients who suffered from impaired glucose tolerance. These patients were randomly assigned either a placebo, metformin, or a lifestyle intervention. The results of this study found that reduced risks of developing diabetes from an average weight loss of 14 pounds (considered to be modest weight loss) was 58% with the placebo in comparison to 31% with the patients who received the metformin. Wing has continued to investigate this, but has changed her focus towards cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. She is currently testing over 5,000 overweight individuals who have type 2 diabetes. This study not only focuses on the effects of weight loss in terms of cardiovascular morbidity, but also has an interest in the impact this weight loss has for the long-term (12 years). =Improving behavioral treatment of obesity= Wing has also looked into how behavioral treatment of obesity can be improved. She has compared the different strategies included in behavioral programs. One example of this would be that high exercise goals and structured approaches to diet increase the chances of improving weight loss outcomes. Wing's studies analyzed the role of involving overweight spouses, using financial incentives, encouraging taking breaks from dieting, and creating intra-group and inter-group competitions. Currently Wing is gathering more information on the effects of reducing variety in the diet and examining the effect of modifying the home environment. Wing has decided to expand her studies on this particular topic by looking at how the internet has an effect on behavioral techniques. She is focusing on various approaches of e-mail counseling or automated counseling. =Preventing weight gain and obesity= Wing is curious as to whether it is statistically possible to prevent weight gain and subsequent obesity. It has been found that there are three critical points in a person's life which have the most effective weight loss. These are childhood, the time surrounding pregnancy, and the menopausal transition. Leonard Epstein worked alongside Wing to assist in complete multiple trials on the behavior treatments of obese children around the ages of 8–12 years old and their overweight parent(s). Research has started to shift in this area towards focusing on children as young as 4–8 years old, and adolescents. Wing concluded that the lifestyle intervention successfully reduced weight gain and the increase in LDL-cholesterol that are usually found in middle-aged women. =Characteristics for maintaining weight loss= Wing recognized that maintenance of weight loss is an important issue when it comes to the treatment of obesity. She is the founder of the National Weight Control Registry, which has a registry of over 5,000 people who have lost over at least 30 pounds, with an average loss of 70 pounds, and kept that weight off for at least one year, with an average of 5.7 years. Information has been collected on the various behaviors that are correlated with long-term maintenance of weight loss through self-reported data. Wing has proven that it is possible to teach the strategies of successful weight losers, resulting in improving others' ability to maintain their own personal weight loss. In an effort to continue and help others, Wing assisted in a project called STOP Regain, where she found that a self-regulation intervention through the internet or face-to-face had the ability to reduce the risk of weight regain. Knowing this, Wing created a study which compares successful weight losers with normal weight controls and obese controls in terms of behavioral measures and brain responses to food cues. Wing focused on whether successful weight losers who have reduced to normal weight now respond to food cues as always- normal weight controls, or if they continue to respond as if obese. Career Dr. Rena Wing received her bachelor's degree in psychology from Connecticut College in 1967. In 1968, she earned her master's degree and doctorate degree in Social Psychology, graduating in 1971. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institute of Mental Health as well as at Harvard Medical School in the department of Psychiatry by 1973. Dr. Wing then spent the next 25 years as a teacher at the University of Pittsburgh. She lectured in psychiatry, psychology, and epidemiology. In between her work in Pittsburgh, Wing also spent a few years as a lecturer in psychology at Stanford University in California. During her years in Pittsburgh, she became the director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in 1999. After she concluded her time in Pittsburgh, she continued her teaching at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Dr. Wing is currently a professor at Brown University, and also dedicates her time to many other research panels and councils.

Originally known as the Oil Creek Reservoir, Cuba Lake was created in 1858 to help maintain water levels on the Genesee Valley Canal. Cuba Lake and its surrounding land is owned by New York State, and was managed as the Cuba Reservation between 1912 and 2011. Today, cottage and home sites on the lake are officially leased from the state as part of the Cuba Lake District. Cuba Lake is a regionally popular fishing and boating destination, with several sportfish and panfish species available. Description Cuba Lake is a reservoir located north of the village of Cuba, primarily within the town of Cuba in Allegany County, with a small portion extending into Cattaraugus County. The lake has a maximum depth of and an average depth of ; during the winter, the lake is drawn down by . The lake is fed by Rawson Creek at its northwest end, and drains south through the Cuba Lake Outlet, a tributary to Oil Creek. The lake's watershed covers . History Originally known as the Oil Creek Reservoir, Cuba Lake was constructed between 1852 and 1858 to serve as a feeder reservoir for the Genesee Valley Canal. The reservoir was impounded by a dam built at a cost of $150,000. When first completed, the reservoir covered ; after being deepened in 1864 and 1872, the reservoir reached a high-water area of . At the time, it was claimed as the largest artificial lake in New York State. In 1878, the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad was completed, replacing the Genesee Valley Canal. The reservoir and a portion of the former canal were retained to help maintain water levels on the Erie Canal. Later, after New York State announced their intention to drain the reservoir, lobbying by former canal superintendent Charles Wyvelle led to the reservoir being saved. The reservoir remained at its high-water mark until 1889, when the water level was lowered by to relieve fears raised by the Johnstown Flood that had occurred that year. =Cuba Reservation= An act of the New York State Legislature established the Cuba Reservation (also known as the Cuba Lake Reservation) in 1912. In doing so, the legislature placed the reservoir and surrounding state lands under control of the New York State Conservation Commission (predecessor to today's Department of Environmental Conservation), who were charged with maintaining the reservoir and encouraging public recreational use of the area. At the time of the reservation's establishment, Cuba Lake covered and the state controlled an additional of land surrounding the reservoir. Before being designated as a reservation, numerous vacation cottages had been erected by private individuals upon the state land. Although the occupiers of these cottages were effectively squatters, the Conservation Commission codified their use of the land by offering five-year leases of the properties (for a $15 annual fee), and established a number of guidelines for the land's use. By 1919, the state had sold nearly of land not needed for recreation, and had enacted or planned improvements relating to the reservation's roads and trees. In 1928, control of Cuba Reservation was transferred to the newly created Allegany State Park Commission, which reported to the Conservation Department's Division of Parks. The duties of the Division of Parks would later be transferred to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, who managed the reservation until 2011. The reservoir and surrounding state property is held by the New York State Office of General Services as of 2015. =Cuba Lake District= In 1981, the Cuba Lake District was formed to aid in managing the needs of the lake and the surrounding cottages, many of which have been converted to permanent residences in recent years. The Cuba Lake District legally rents the land from New York State, and in turn collects lease fees from residents. It also works to organize maintenance activities on the reservoir and dam, publicize safety bulletins, and develop and enforce regulations. Recreation Cuba Lake is a popular regional destination for boating and fishing. Public access to the lake is permitted through a state- managed boat launch located near Rawson Creek's inlet on West Shore Road. Ice fishing access is possible from South Shore Road near the dam. Sportfish species found in Cuba Lake include walleye, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, northern pike, common carp, yellow perch, rock bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, and black crappie.

White feminism is criticized for its feminist theories that focus solely on the experience of white women and fail to acknowledge and integrate the notion of intersectionality in the struggle for equality. This approach was predominantly visible in the first waves of feminism which generally centered around the empowerment of white middle-class females in Western societies. While the term white feminism and debate around the topic are relatively recent, its critics date back to the beginning of the feminist movement, especially in the United States. By theorizing the overlapping systems of oppression in society (dependent on race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, etc.), the development of Crenshaw's theory of intersectionality has recently galvanized critics of white feminism, described as restrictive and discriminatory.  Origins  Since its origin, feminism in Western societies has been represented by white educated women primarily focusing on the right to political representation and vote. One of the most prominent examples of the early feminist revendications is found in Mary Wollstonecraft's text, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman published in 1792 and in which she advocates for moral and political equality between men and women. Similarly, in France, Olympe de Gouges advocated for women’s rights in her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen as early as 1791.  In first- wave feminism  Women's suffrage parade in New York City, May 6, 1912. First- wave feminism began in the early modern period and continued into the early 20th century, and focused primarily on legal issues pertaining to women, especially women's suffrage. This wave officially started with the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York, towards the end of the Industrial Revolution. The goal of this wave was to open up opportunities for women, with a focus on suffrage. It was a movement predominantly organized and defined by middle-class, educated white women, and concentrated mostly on issues pertaining to them. Some ethnic minority women were embraced in the movement, such as suffragette Princess Sophia Duleep Singh among the British first-wave feminists. However, there is little evidence that black women participated in the British suffragette effort. In 1893, New Zealand became the first nation to grant women of all races the right to vote; this was met with anger from suffragists including Millicent Fawcett, who expressed displeasure that Māori women in one of the British colonies were able to vote, while British women of society were not. Susan B. Anthony (a staunch abolitionist) and Elizabeth Cady Stanton fought for white women to get the right to vote in the United States of America, prioritising this above black men getting the right to vote. Anthony and Stanton were wary of creating an \\"aristocracy of sex\\"; rather, they proposed universal suffrage, such that the black community and women (including black women) get enfranchised at the same time. Nevertheless, their “History of Woman Suffrage”, is a clear example of white feminism as it widely disregards the role of black women while focusing on white figures of the movement. While 1920 is celebrated as the obtention of Women’s suffrage in the United States, African American women were still evicted from voting polls in the Jim Crow South. At that time, white women largely viewed African American women as excluded from the feminist movement and the black suffragist Mary Church Terrel was denied the help of white activists. Still, African American women have had an important role in the battle for equality in the United States. As early as 1851, Sojourner Truth, a former slave, delivered a speech “Ain’t I a woman” in which she calls for what would be later on described as intersectionality.  In second-wave and third-wave feminism  Second-wave feminism, particularly at its outset, was similarly shaped by middle-class, educated white women, and again it did not tend to consider issues that were specifically relevant to ethnic minority women. The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir, stands as the one of the most striking example of the essentialization of women in the figure of the white bourgeoise mother and hence disregard for other forms of oppressions such as race or sexuality. Nevertheless, this book has appeared as a landmark which has enabled other more complex theories to emerge. During the second and third-wave feminist periods, scholars from marginalised communities began to write back against the way in which feminist movements had been essentializing the experiences of women. The notable feminist scholar bell hooks brought this issue to the forefront of feminist thought, regularly writing about the struggles that black women experienced and emphasizing that the feminist movement was exclusionary towards those women by virtue of its inattention to the interactions between race, gender, and class. hooks argued that white women should recognise the fact that they, like ethnic minority men, occupied a position of being both oppressed while also being oppressors. In an attempt to shun the critics addressed by scholars from minorities exposing second-wave feminism, the latter sought to divert attention by exposing inequalities and injustice faced by women abroad. This has been criticized by many scholars which have labeled it under several names such as missionary or imperialist feminism.  21st century intersectional feminism, or fourth wave  During third wave feminism and at the start of fourth wave feminism after 2010, feminists sometimes emphasize intersectional perspectives in their work. Despite this, some have argued that feminist media continues to overrepresent the struggles of straight, middle class, white women. The position held by some modern feminist authors that racism is not an element of society that feminism needs to be concerned with has also been cited as exemplifying white feminism. Nevertheless, in recent years, authors like Crenshaw have developed the theory of intersectionality, a clear opposition to white feminism. Rather than analyzing society from a unique perspective of race or gender, she calls for a more complex analysis of systems of oppression using multiple and overlapping lenses such as race, gender, sexuality,etc. White feminism portrays a view of feminism that can be separated from issues of class, race, ability, and other oppressions. An example of white feminism in the present day can be seen in the work of Emily Shire, politics editor at Bustle and an op-ed contributor for The New York Times. Shire argues that feminism excludes some women who do not share political viewpoints when it takes positions on Israel and Palestine, efforts to raise the minimum wage, and efforts to block the construction of oil pipelines. Shire's position contrasts with intersectional feminist activists who view pay equity, social justice, and international human rights as essential and inseparable commitments of feminism, as articulated in the Day Without a Woman platform that \\"[recognizes] the enormous value that women of all backgrounds add to our socio-economic system – while receiving lower wages and experiencing greater inequities, vulnerability to discrimination, sexual harassment, and job insecurity\\". While Shire advocates for a feminism that achieves inclusivity by avoiding political positions so as to not alienate women who disagree with those positions, organizers of the Women's March hold the principle that \\"women have intersecting identities\\" necessitating a movement that focuses on a \\"comprehensive agenda\\". It has also been argued that the beliefs of some feminists that hijabs, burqas, and niqabs are oppressive towards Muslim women are representative of white feminism. Many Muslim women have spoken out in defense of their religious dress practices. One example of this belief is the Islamic scarf controversy in France that has argued against the Islamic veil by many French feminists claiming that Islam threatens women's autonomy and thus choosing to wear one is meaningless, when many Muslim women say that it is a choice and that denying the choice only restricts a woman's freedom. They say that some wear it as a personal commitment; others reject the notion that the veil is a religious sign. Trans-exclusionary radical feminism has also been a topic of discussion. Feminism requires fighting for women's rights, but trans-exclusionary radical feminists do not see trans women as women. Many of them argue against trans women changing their sex on legal documents, say that lesbian as an identity is disappearing, that trans men are not men, and that gay children need protection when they think they are transgender. Critics, especially within the LGBT community, have expressed their discontent with these arguments. They feel that privileged white women who make these arguments will make trans women, especially trans women of color, more at risk for discrimination and that they fail to consider many other factors that trans women have to deal with.

The Co- op also billed itself as part of the United Cartoon Workers of America (U.C.W. of A.), an informal union organized in 1970 by Crumb, Green, Griffith, Spiegelman, Spain, Roger Brand, Nancy Griffith, and Michele Brand.Young Lust #3 (Last Gasp, June 1972). (The U.C.W. of A. brand appeared on a number of other comix of that era.) The collective's first release was Jerry Lane's Middle Class Fantasies, published in May 1973; later titles that year were Kim Deitch's Corn Fed Comics #2 (continued from Honeywell & Todd) and Bill Griffith's Tales of Toad #3 (continued from the Print Mint). In 1974, the press released Jay Lynch's Nard n' Pat #1 (March), the anthology Lean Years (May), S. Clay Wilson's Pork (May), Robert Crumb & Aline Kominsky-Crumb's Dirty Laundry Comics #1 (July), the anthology Sleazy Scandals of the Silver Screen (August), and the anthology Manhunt #2 (continued from the Print Mint; December). The press was launched on the verge of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, in Miller v. California, that local communities could decide their own First Amendment standards with reference to obscenity. In the mid-1970s, sale of drug paraphernalia was outlawed in many places, which caused head shops, where comix were typically sold, to go out of business. After losing their largest distribution network, mail order became the only outlet for underground titles.Estren, Mark James (1993). \\"Foreword: Onward!\\". A History of Underground Comics. Ronin Publishing. pp. 7–8; 10. . As a result, many publishers, including Cartoonists Co-op Press, left the comix business. After the 1974 dissolution of Cartoonists Co-op Press, a number of the publisher's titles were continued by Kitchen Sink Press.

The line survived until 1917 when it was pulled up and sent to France for the World War I effort. The Tidewater and Western Railroad carried freight and passengers along a route from Farmville, Virginia to Bermuda Hundred. The Tidewater and Western Railroad continued to have Western Union Telegraphs run along the rails. These connected to telegraphs on the Atlantic Coast Line along the East Coast of the US and to Europe. History =Businesses that used the Tidewater and Western= The Village of Beach Station was a stop on the Tidewater and Western Railroad as well as the Farmville and Powhatan. Rail Transport from Cumberland County helped Cumberland farmers sell fruits, vegetables and timber to Farmville markets. A magazine notice for renting the Turkey Island Plantation advertised that the farm is near the Tobaccoville station of the Tidewater and Western Railroad which would help the farmer get dairy products to market. From 1884 to 1917, the Farmville and Powhatan Railroad, later named the Tidewater and Western Railroad, was important to Cumberland County residents for markets and transportation and the telegraph. The owners hoped that the line would ship products all the way to Chester, Virginia and docks at Bermuda Hundred to make the railroad profitable. However, the line had trouble competing with the Standard gauge Southern railway. =Coal to Ship over Rails= The Farmville Coal and Iron Company built a one and a half mile spur rail line from the Farmville and Powhatan Railroad to the mine. This railroad provided transport from the mine to the docks at Bermuda Hundred in the Tidewater region. On Jan. 24, 1891, an editor of “The Financial Mining Record” suggested that the Farmville Coal & Iron Company did not have enough coal production to justify a fraction of its stock price. The Norfolk and Western Railway, since 1883, had been bringing in coal from a new coal mine, the Pocahontas Coalfield, which could provide coal more cheaply and ship the coal on a larger standard gauge, class one railroad. This decreased to the economic viability of mining coal in the Richmond and Farmville Basins. The Farmville Coal and Iron Company went bankrupt a few years later, possibly before any coal was mined. =Financial Difficulties= The Tidewater and Western Railroad was losing money each year, the lawyers reported. If the railroad increased rates, they would lose customers to the Southern Railway. The State Corporation resisted letting investors close railroads if there was an alternative investor who was willing to run them. Wealthy investors in Cumberland, where much of the tracks lay, were unwilling to purchase all shares at less that the value of all of the property owned by the company because the Tidewater and Western Railroad had not been able to pay a dividend after taxes. Hopes to Save the Tidewater and Western In 1917, two attempts at stating industries were made which could have saved the Tidewater and Western Railroad by giving it something to haul. =Clay= Thomas A. Bolling tried brickmaking from clay in the Farmville Basin in 1917. He used a pug mill to make bricks from the clay. He had a plant on High Street. Ries and Somers tested his clay and clay from another pit and found that some of it could even be used for hollow bricks which must be stronger as well as drain tile. =Oil= Also in 1917, the Tidewater Oil and Gas Company drilled an exploratory hole over 1500 feet deep in the Fork Swamp area in the Willis River. Oil was found about 1000 ft down but the company eventually closed 1921. Bankruptcy of the Tidewater Western Railroad A Narrow-gauge rail on display at the Richmond Railroad Museum in Richmond, Virginia. The Tidewater and Western, eventually had to be sold. George M. Wilson, who had been treasurer of this railroad and two predecessors operated the railroad until he died in April 1917. The French Government then bought the railroad's portable assets from the receiver for the World War I effort. The rails, ties and cars other than a few engines were driven up the docks at Bermuda Hundred and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the engines were sold to be used in the U.S. A piece of the rail was left at the Railroad Museum in Richmond. The rails were never used for replacing bombed rails as had been planned. =Automobile Roads built on Track Bed= Virginia State Route 10 was built from Bermuda Hundred on the north side of the Appomattox River east almost to Chesterfield Court House on or near the old railroad tracks in 1918, after the railroad was sold. Beach road was built from near the Chesterfield Courthouse, to Winterpock on or near the old railbed. There a gas station still operates which was built to serve Winterpock in 1926. Near the old Nash stop, near Nash road, is the old granite Swift Creek Rail Bridge hidden in the woods behind a landfill and housing complex. Coalboro Road is built on or near the spur from Colboro to Epps Falls. The Tidewater and Western track bed in Cumberland County was replaced with Virginia State Route 13 in 1918, following the sale of the tracks. A road for automobiles. Virginia State Route 45, which was also built on the track bed of the Tidewater & Western Railroad, was built from Cumberland to Farmville in 1928.

There were nine passenger cars and 2 baggage cars. The train hauled mostly freight and there were 143 freight cars. Location The Tidewater and Western extended from Farmville to Mosley, where it crossed the Southern, to Chester, where it crossed the Atlantic Coast Line and the Richmond Trolley, all the way to Bermuda Hundred where goods could be shipped or received by boat to and from New York, Boston or across the Atlantic to Europe.

It grows on living and fallen leaves, creating tan, ovular lesions inch in diameter and ringed with 'purple' or black spores. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms are close in proximity. The disease creates small circular dead patches (a sign), which are tan to brown with purple or colored edges. There are little black dots which gather in these lesions; these are the pycnidia which release conidia, the polycyclic and asexual stage of the fungus. Life cycle The fungus overwinters as spores in leaf litter. In the spring, wind and rain carry the spores upward. When they land on leaves, they begin to grow, creating asexual pycnidia (also called conidiophores) which hold conidia. The conidia disperse and this cycle continues for the duration of the season, producing and spreading more and more conidia, until leaves carrying the spores fall and lack of resources or stress causes the spores to settle in for the winter. Disease management Purple-bordered leaf spot is primarily cosmetic, especially on mature or vigorous trees. However, the disease can defoliate trees early in the growing season. Although they often are able to grow new leaves within a few weeks, this strains the tree, so it is important to water and (if desired) fertilize, so the tree has the nutrients it needs to overcome this stress. If the purple-bordered leaf spot is persistent for several years or adversely affecting a young tree, a fungicide containing copper, neem oil, sulfur, chlorothalonil or thiophanate- methyl can help manage the fungus. The best form of management is planting resistant strains (purple-bordered leaf spot most heavily infects Amur, Japanese, red, silver and sugar maples). Additionally, it is important to remove, burn or bury leaf litter from infected trees in the fall or early spring, as this is where the spores overwinter.

His work spans a critical study of king Ashoka, nine novels in English, six novels in Sinhala and a collection of poems, and numerous articles in newspapers, journals and magazines. He is the author of the first e-novel in Asia, 'The Saadhu Testament' (1998), and the first e-novel in Sinhala, 'Vessan Novu Wedun' (2003). His first nonfiction work is \\"Who is Ashoka?\\" He is the only Sri Lankan writer to receive the Sri Lankan State Literary Award for the best English novel three times and was awarded the SAARC Literary Award in 2013.http://archives.dailynews.lk/2013/03/27/fea20.asp Being the first Sri Lankan to release his work online and for free access, he is often seen as one of Sri Lanka's earliest and most vocal advocates for the ebook format, copyleft and Creative Commons.  Early life  Dayananda Dissanayake (he later shortened his name to Daya) was born on March 8, 1947 in Galle, Sri Lanka. He has five siblings and is the eldest offspring of Albert Dissanayake and Agnus Wavala Panditha. Daya first attended Southland Balika Vidyalaya, later joining St. Aloysius College, where he remained until after his G.C.E A/L examinations. Daya lost his father at the age of fourteen, and was largely raised by his mother and his father's younger brother, Mahinda Dissanayake; his mother wove cotton saris at home and his uncle supported them with his salary as a teacher,Galle. Daya married Indrani Pathirana, of Mahamodara, Galle, who studied at the Sacred Heart Convent, Galle, which adjoined St. Aloysius' College. She started her career as an English teacher at Koggalla Vidyalaya, Ambalantota, in 1972. With their two children they lived in a house in Unawatuna until 1985, when he and his wife were both transferred to Colombo – he, to the Head Office of the Cement Corporation, his wife to the Curriculum Development Center, affiliated to the Ministry of Education (later renamed to the National Institute of Education). The family migrated to Colombo that year and now lives in Battaramulla, a suburb of Colombo.  Corporate career  Daya Dissanayake's first job was as teacher of science at Sacred Heart Convent, Galle. He later joined the Sri Lanka Cement Corporation, in Kankesanthurai, Jaffna, as a trainee chemist in 1968. In 1970 he was transferred to Galle, and in 1983, he received a diploma in programming and systems design and was appointed as an Analyst Programmer at the Head Office of the Cement Corporation. When he was transferred from the Head Office in Colombo, to the cement factory in Puttalam, he resigned from his post at the Cement Corporation and joined a private company which dealt in manufacturing furniture. He later joined the Nawaloka Group of companies, first as the D.P. Manager at the Nawaloka Hospital, and then joined an associate company Nawakrama. He functioned as the Director/General Manager of several Nawaloka divisions (Ceyoka, Nawaloka Trading, and Koala). dealing in pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, vaccines, and also equipment for construction, power generation, welding, etc. He retired from the Nawaloka group in 2012 after serving for over twenty five years.  Literary career  In his youth Daya Dissanayake contributed to the school magazine, and wrote articles for the Sinhala paper, Ada, popular at the time for fostering radical views. While in school he was more popular as a photographer than a writer; other than winning an award in a competition held by the British Council, Colombo when he was in his twenties, his creative activities in his youth were confined to typing numerous short stories on a battered typewriter – stories which remain unpublished - and are largely lost. Daya started writing seriously in his forties. His writing often features the subjects of non-violence, history, archeology, Buddhism and how people perceive and adopt religion in their lives. His first novel was Kat bitha (1998) in which he narrates the story of Sigiriya through the musings of a young monk who visits the site in the 11th century. Kat bitha won the State Literary Award in 1998. His next book, The Saadhu Testament (1998) was published the same year and was heralded as the first Asian novel to be published in an electronic format. This was followed by the Healer and the Drug Pusher in 2000, as the first POD book from Sri Lanka and its Sinhala version, 'Vessan novu wedun (2003), which became the first e-book in Sinhala. His other novels include , The Bastard Goddess (2003) and Thirst (2004). He launched Moonstone in English and Chandraratnage Bawanthara Charikawa in Sinhala in 2006. He was described by the Sunday Observer as one of the \\"Five Golden Authors\\" who shared the Swarna Pusthaka Award in 2006. His next novel, Eavesdropper, which won the State Literary Award again, was published in 2007. The Sinhala version 'Asa Sitiya Ohu Mese'(2008). Miracle Under the Kumbuk Tree (2012) won the Sri Lankan National Award for the Best English Novel. the Sinhala version is 'Babli' (2011) The Clone, along with its Sinhala language counterpart, 'Kloniyakage Katha Vasthuwa' also came out in 2012. \\"Daya Dissanayake's greatest virtue is that he sees Sri Lanka ‘steadily and sees it whole’ he writes well (though not in the narcissistic manner of Romesh Gunasekare) and gives us an evocative portrayal of a world we see daily but do not perceive – the rural underclass – a culture incredibly foreign to snug Colombian gatherings – perhaps dangerously so. Dissanayake's presentation of them, as of monks, evangelists and money makers is admirably unvarnished and knowledgeable,\\" stated Regi Siriwardena, upon examination of Miracle Under the Kumbuk Tree. The English novels are available on Kindle. His first nonfiction work,\\" Who was Ashoka? A critical study \\" was published in 2019 by Birdnest, Odisha. Most of the papers presented by him are available at https://independent.academia.edu/dayadissanayake In addition to his main body of work, Dissanayake also blogs on www.saadhu.com, has translated two books from Sinhala to English (Swayanjatha which was nominated for the State Literary Award for best translation in 2012 and 'Son of the Soil', the biography of H.K Dharmadasa). He has also published a collection of poems titled Inequality, which reviewers from the Sunday Observer noted for its experimental use of language. Prof. Sunanda Mahendra wrote a glowing review for the Daily News, stating that \\"Daya is, to all intents, a reformer of sorts. He hangs his thoughts on seething crosses and asks that we regard them with our conscience.\\"  Awards  Daya Dissanayake received the State Literary Award for the Best English novel for his debut novel Kat bitha in 1998. In 2007 he received the award once again for Evesdropper, and in 2013 for Miracle Under the Kumbuk Tree. In 2006 he shared the Swarna Pusthaka award with five others, and in 2013 he also won the same for the best Sinhala novel with four others for Chandrarathnage Bawanthara Charikawa. In the same year he received the SAARC Literary Award conferred by the Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature.  Advocacy  Daya Dissanayake is noted for his advocacy of the abolishing of copyright, considered by many to be an unusual viewpoint. He is vocal against what he describes as \\"the commodification of art\\" and has called for writers to place their works in the public domain, pointing out that with freedom of publication, writers \\"would write freely, for their own pleasure and satisfaction, and readers could read freely, of their own choice, without any control, or monitoring or censorship\\". He has also advocated against awards and competition schemes for novels, stating that award ceremonies should be called off as they create \\"unnecessary friction, suspicion and jealousy.\\" He is regarded by many to be the first Sri Lankan advocate for electronic books and self-publishing.

It was equipped with a primary oscillating turret. It was similar to the AMX-13 and the T92 Light Tank. By 1953, there were 3 designs that were suggested as a replacement. Those 3 designs were drawn by Detroit Arsenal, Cadillac, and Aircraft Armaments. History In 1952, the Army Ordnance Committee gave general required characteristics for a replacement of the M41 Walker Bulldog. Originally, there was a 20 ton maximum weight and a requirement for a 90 mm gun. This requirement was later changed to an 18-ton weight limit and a 76 millimeter gun which would have allowed a quicker replacement of the barrel. Design It had an oscillating turret and a second turret mounted on the previous turret; the first turret had the primary armament of a 76mm M1A2 or a 76mm T185; the second \\"mini turret\\" had a secondary armament of an American GPMG. Separated suspension wheels made it easier to cross difficult terrain. It was proposed to serve as an armed reconnaissance vehicle, only aided in its endeavours by the tank's light weight and therefore faster speeds. Main armament The T71 had a choice between two guns, the 76mm M1A2 or a 76mm T185. Both guns used an auto-loading system, which benefit from light- weighted, low-profile, higher rate of fire, and fewer crew members. However, that meant that the commander and the gunner would have had to manually load the magazine after expending the shells in the magazine, leaving the vehicle very vulnerable while reloading. The relatively small caliber of the gun also was rather ineffective against thick armor, such as the Russian heavy tank series \\"IS\\".

Micah Goldman also played bass for the band for a period. The duo are best known for the track \\"Sorry Song\\", which came out in July 2003. Background and group history Coming out of the Southern California scene, particularly in terms of the independent music played in coffeehouses and other such locations, they made their full studio major label debut with 2003's Massaging Your Ego, which was released by Elektra Records. The duo's pop and post-grunge rock n roll based sound is heavily influenced by the work of the Grateful Dead, a band that the sisters were introduced to by their father. The publication Allmusic has compared them to musician Ani DiFranco. The group's three-song single Sorry Song/What Do You Do came out on July 22, 2003. It received production work by notable musician Oliver Leiber, who also shares songwriting credits on the release. He produced work by a wide variety of pop and rock n roll artists throughout the 2000s such as BBMak, Boomkat, The Corrs, The Knack, Silvertide, and Youngstown. Leiber started out as a member of the funk and soul group Ta Mara & the Seen in the 1980s. Although receiving a smattering of attention, the Troys faded into obscurity as the years went on, although attracting a local audience.

She wrote for Computer Gaming World, performing reviews on role-playing video games and adventure games. Scorpia was known for harsh criticism of video games she disliked. She was fired after CGW was sold to Ziff-Davis in 1999 and subsequently retired from games journalism. Her pseudonym is based on a character she created in a role- playing game.  Career  Scorpia became interested in computers after attending a computer expo. Her initial intention was to become a programmer, and she said she bought her first computer games to learn how to program. In November 1982, while working as a data processing consultant, Scorpia co- founded an early gaming-related Special Interest Group on CompuServe. It became the eighth most popular forum on CompuServe, and Scorpia received free access to the subscription service in return for maintaining it. As a system operator, she ran online conferences and hosted games. The following year, Computer Gaming World (CGW) owner Russell Sipe contacted her on CompuServe and invited her to write for the magazine. Scorpia agreed, though she had never read it. She reviewed role-playing video games and adventure games there for 16 years. Scorpia became a prominent reviewer in the industry. In addition to her writing and online presence, she provided hints to players who contacted her through a post office box. CGW billed her as \\"controversial\\", and often published a Scorpia review together with another of the same game by a different reviewer. She became known for harsh criticism of video games she disliked. Scorpia's review of Ultima VIII: Pagan was highlighted by GameSetWatch as one of the harshest video game reviews ever written. Her review of Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World resulted in an angry response from the game's designer, Jon Van Caneghem, who named a monster after Scorpia in his next game. While usually a fan of Infocom, she so disliked Infidel that she never mentioned it in print, although lambasting the game during an online chat with creator Mike Berlyn. CGW editor Johnny Wilson described Scorpia as \\"one of the most refreshing people you could ever meet\\" and praised her encyclopedic knowledge of games' puzzles. He cited one example where the two clashed, the role-playing game Darklands. Scorpia wrote a negative review that criticized the game's bugs, and Wilson attached an editorial sidebar that gave a more positive view. Wilson later acknowledged this was a bad idea, saying that Scorpia's fans correctly criticized him for undercutting her review and overlooking the game's flaws. Because the magazine required a reviewer to finish the game before publishing the review, Wilson said Scorpia favored linearity, resulting in unwarranted criticism of some open-ended works; CGW thus sometimes did not assign her such games. Scorpia was fired after CGW was sold to Ziff Davis in 1999. She said it was intimated to her that the magazine wanted to go in a different direction. She neither looked for further work in games journalism nor received any offers; she attributed her reputation for tough reviews as one possible reason for the latter. Scorpia started a subscription webzine after this, but it failed when she could not find enough subscribers. She subsequently started a free website, where she blogged. She stopped updating the site in 2009 after saying that she was unable to afford a new computer needed to keep reviewing games.  Personal life  Her pseudonym comes from role-playing games and is based on her astrological sign of Scorpio. She said she was already known as Scorpia because of her work in online communities and found it \\"more fitting\\" than her real name for her focus on role-playing games and adventure games. She values her privacy and cited that as another reason for using a pseudonym. At CGW, only owner Sipe knew her real name. Her favorite video game is Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar.

The government ceased to exist on March 4, 1906, a little more than one year before Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory combined to form the present state of Oklahoma. The building was sold to Johnston County, Oklahoma, in 1992, which used it as the county courthouse. The Chickasaw Nation repurchased the structure and has turned it into a museum. Creation of the National Capitol After the Chickasaws were forced to emigrate to the Indian Territory, they built their main town, Tishomingo, where they constructed a one-room log council house to serve as their capitol. In 1856, the Chickasaws built a two-story brick building that would be their capitol until 1898. The ravages of the Civil War and the aftermath of financial hard times left the 1856 building in a sorry state. The Chickasaw leaders ordered that the old building be dismantled and that a new capitol should be put in its place. Green, Richard. \\"178.

Despite the knowledge that the capitol would soon become useless because the Nation itself would become defunct, the Nation pursued construction of an imposing building as a memorial to the existence of the Chickasaw people. Robert M. Harris, who was elected Governor in 1896, is credited with being the driving force behind the construction. The Victorian gothic structure is built of red granite from Pennington Creek.

These rings can range from to nearly in diameter, with rims about in thickness. The origin of forest rings is not known, despite several mechanisms for their creation having been proposed. Such hypotheses include radially growing fungus, buried kimberlite pipes, trapped gas pockets, and meteorite impact craters.  History  Because of their large scale, forest rings are not apparent from the ground, and it was not until aerial photography became a common surveying tool in the 1950s that geologists began to notice them. The term \\"forest ring\\" was coined by The Ontario Geological Survey to differentiate the phenomenon from fairy rings.  Hypothesis  = Biological = Forest rings were originally thought to be caused by the radial growth of fungi within the root system of black spruce (Picea mariana), possibly the fungus Armillaria ostoyae. A ring would begin as a single point of infection and grow outward in all directions. Affected trees would die in the interior of the circle, and eventually new trees would grow in their place. The fungal mat would become ring-shaped and visible from above as a circular ring of stunted trees. The fungal hypothesis is no longer favoured as there is little compelling evidence to support it. Observations of forest rings in the Abitibi region of Quebec have found no evidence of mass tree mortality by a pathogen. It was further hypothesized that bacteria, such as Geobacter, might be contributing to the ring formation. Their capability to form conducting nanowires or pili and to perform directional electron transport might contribute to a circular charge transfer from the electron-rich center of the ring towards the ring edges. The so-catalyzed oxidation processes increase acidity and dissolve carbonates, thus creating a depression, and, accordingly, the ring edge. Recent microbiological investigations indeed show a high abundance of Geobacter at the ring edge.  Outside of Canada  Forest rings have also been reported in Russia and Australia.

The election was won by MP Robert Muldoon.  Background  Marshall's government had been defeated by Labour in the 1972 general election. There had been some caucus dissension in 1974, encouraged by Muldoon, about whether or not Marshall should lead the National Party into the next election, scheduled in 1975. The party executive asked the caucus to affirm that it supported Marshall continuing as leader. On 3 July 1974, the caucus voted 19 to 13 in favour of having a leadership vote. Believing he would probably lose a vote he sought the advice of MP George Gair who strongly urged him not to stand for re-election. Marshall announced his resignation as party leader the next day on 4 July 1974.  Candidates  = Robert Muldoon = Muldoon was a high-profile member of the National Party. He had served as Minister of Finance under Holyoake since 1967. It was he whose National's shock win in 1969 was attributed and as s result Muldoon had challenged Marshall for the leadership in 1972 but was defeated. Muldoon had become a popular figure with the public and adapted well to the new media of television coverage that other politicians struggled with which increased his campaigning abilities. In opposition, Marshall was shown to be ineffectual at the skills required to topple Labour's popular leader Norman Kirk and as a result National's backbenchers were increasingly looking to Muldoon for leadership raising questions of Marshall.  Result  A leadership election was held on 9 July 1974 in which Muldoon was the only candidate and was acclaimed.  Aftermath  Muldoon became Leader of the Opposition and went on to lead the National Party to victory in the 1975 general election, becoming Prime Minister of New Zealand and would remain in power until the 1984 election. Marshall retired at the 1975 election, serving as Muldoon's Shadow Minister on Overseas Trade until the dissolution of Parliament.

Early life  Evansky was born in Worms, Germany on 30 May 1922, to a Jewish family who were immigrants from Poland. Her father was sent to Dachau concentration camp in 1938, and Rose was one of the last children to be sent to Britain from Germany on the Kindertransport trains.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/world/europe/rose-evansky-blow- drying-dies.html?_r=0  Hairstyling technique  In 1962, from her salon window, Evansky noticed a barber using a powerful new hand-held dryer—together with a hairbrush—to smooth a man's hair. A little while later she was spotted trying it in her salon (on a Mrs. Hay) by Clare Rendlesham who set about marketing this blow-wave which worked on straight hair as well. Within a year, all the leading stylists in Mayfair, London offered it. using a hand-held blowdryer on her Mayfair clients \\"to create a soft, natural look\\". She also trained the notable hairdresser, Leonard of Mayfair. This was quite a step up from her early beginnings as an apprentice working for Adolf Cohen of Whitechapel Road, known as the \\"professor\\" of the hairdressing trade, who also trained Vidal Sassoon. After the war the couple opened their first hair salon together in 1947 in Hendon, north London. Within six years, they were able to move up the career ladder, renting premises in North Audley Street, Mayfair. But when she moved into blowdrying, her husband accused her of \\"having gone mad,\\" since they had just purchased 20 new hood dryers and he was not prepared to throw them out. A few were kept for the older clients and those who still requested high-dressed, lacquered styles. This was one element of the strain on their marriage, and they later divorced.  Personal life  In 1942 Evansky married her first husband, fellow hairdresser Albert Evansky. In 1965, Evansky married Denis Cannan whom she had met through clients. Within ten years she left the hairdressing profession and moved with her husband to retire in the Sussex countryside. They returned to London for a while, then retired to Hove, East Sussex. After she was noticed at the launch of a book by another 1960s hairdresser, and interviewed by radio and fashion press, she wrote a memoir in 2013, In Paris We Sang (2013). Reaching Mayfair had been an achievement. Rose's family fled antisemitism in Poland after the first world war to settle in Germany, but under Nazi rule Rose's father, Max Lerner, was sent to Dachau in 1938. He was released the following year and left for Britain, where he was joined by his wife, his son, Heinie, and Rose. She was 16 and spoke only Yiddish and German when she boarded one of the last kindertransport trains to safety in the UK.

Early life and military service  Jay E. Nash was born on March 29, 1843, in Hadley, Massachusetts, to Samuel and Lurintha (Ball) Nash. Samuel was born on March 13, 1810, and was a farmer and surveyor, who also served in the Massachusetts General Court for a time. Lurintha was born on March 12, 1811, and was a member of the New England Ball family. Samuel and Lurintha were married on May 1, 1834. Jay was the couple's second son and third child overall, out of four sons and three daughters. However, his youngest sister, Anna M. Nash, died in 1851, just eight days after her first birthday. Nash enlisted in the Union Army on September 10, 1861, mustering into Company D of the 27th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry ten days later. Nash stayed in the Army for the remainder of the American Civil War, re-enlisting when his initial term of enlistment expired in 1863. Through the course of the war, he participated in twenty battles, and was eventually promoted to the rank of Sergeant. Nash was wounded in action at Petersburg on July 16, 1864. On March 8, 1865, Nash was captured in North Carolina, and thereafter briefly held as a prisoner of war until he was exchanged on March 27. Following the end of the war, Nash was mustered out of the Army on June 26, 1865.  Postbellum  With the end of the Civil War, Nash returned home to Hadley, resuming residence in his family home, wherein his mother (who had been widowed in 1861) and his younger siblings still resided.\\"Massachusetts State Census, 1865,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MQC8-8DQ : 15 November 2014), Jay E Nash in household of Nash, Hadley, Hampshire, Massachusetts; State Archives, Boston; FHL microfilm 954,566.

In 1880, Nash purchased 40 acres of land in what was then Crystal Lake Township, Hennepin County, where the Nashes established a dairy farm with 82 head of cattle. Nash also established a hardware store in the township in 1886, thereby diversifying his income. In response to a land grab made by the City of Minneapolis, whereby Minneapolis annexed a number of nearby townships in order to increase its taxable property, the residents of Crystal Lake Township incorporated the Village of Crystal in 1887, which would, six years later, be reincorporated as the Village of Robbinsdale. Martha Nash would not, however, long reside on the Nash farm, as the couple divorced at some point in 1885 or 1886. In 1886, the 43 year old Nash remarried, taking Clara Louise Cooper, a Vermont native 13 years his junior, as his new wife.\\"United States Census, 1900,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M9SL-QK6 : accessed 7 December 2016), Jay E Nash, Crystal Lake & St. Anthony Townships Robbinsdale village, Hennepin, Minnesota, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 133, sheet 14B, family 252, NARA microfilm publication T623 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1972.); FHL microfilm 1,240,770.

Foundation of the Socialist Party; first gubernatorial campaign  As Jay E. Nash grew older, reflection upon his experiences from the Civil War convinced him that war was an enterprise of organized murder. As he grew increasingly pacifistic, he furthermore became convinced that socialism was the only way to guarantee peace. In 1899, Nash was one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party of Minnesota, a state affiliate of the Springfield faction of the Social Democratic Party of America. Quickly establishing himself as a respected leader within the state organization, Nash was elected to represent the Social Democratic Party of Minnesota as a delegate to the Socialist Unity Convention of 1901, wherein the Chicago-based and Springfield- based Social Democratic Parties were merged to form the Socialist Party of America. His presence would become ubiquitous in the Minnesota delegations to the national conventions of the Socialist Party, as he was elected to represent Minnesota at every national convention of the party held before his death. In 1902, Nash was chosen to serve as the nominee of the newly renamed Socialist Party of Minnesota at that year's gubernatorial election. However, Nash's candidacy in that election quickly hit a stumbling block when the Socialist Labor Party objected to Nash's use of the ballot designation \\"Socialist,\\" and attempted to bar Nash from appearing on the ballot altogether. In October 1902, the case went before the Minnesota Supreme Court, which ruled that, because the Minnesota Party Name Protection Act prohibited any candidate from using any part of the name of a recognized political party if that candidate was not endorsed by that party, and because the Socialist Labor Party had been recognized in Minnesota since 1896, Nash could not use the designation \\"Socialist\\" on the ballot. The court, however, ruled that there wasn't sufficient cause to bar Nash from appearing on the ballot. The Court also ruled that he could not revert to the \\"Social Democratic\\" designation, because that contained part of the name of the Minnesota Democratic Party, and so Nash was placed on the ballot without a party designation in 1902. Nash won just 0.93 percent of the vote, down from Thomas H. Lucas' 1.13 percent from 1900. Although the party name prohibition did not apply to any of the Socialist candidates for the other state constitutional offices in that election (who were all listed on the ballot with the \\"Socialist\\" designation), the party knew it would be vulnerable to legal actions if it continued to run candidates with that designation in the future. This caused the Socialist Party of Minnesota to adopt the name \\"Public Ownership Party of Minnesota\\" (for non-ballot purposes, named the \\"Public Ownership (Socialist) Party of Minnesota\\") after the 1902 election, which it continued to use through 1912. Ultimately, the Socialist Labor Party did not have any candidates on the state general election ballot in 1912, which caused it to lose official recognition and thus protection under the Party Name Protection Act; seizing upon the opportunity, the Public Ownership (Socialist) Party reverted to the Socialist Party name following the 1912 elections.  Second gubernatorial campaign and State Secretary  Despite his lackluster finish in the 1902 election, Nash's star in the Public Ownership (Socialist) Party, as it was then known, continued to rise. In 1904, State Secretary Spencer M. Holman decided not to seek another term in that office. On February 22, the state convention of the Public Ownership (Socialist) Party of Minnesota, meeting in Minneapolis, elected Nash to succeed Holman as State Secretary. Nash was also, once again, chosen as the party's nominee for the office of Governor in the 1904 election. To date, Nash remains the only person to be nominated twice by the Socialist Party of Minnesota for the office of Governor, and his tenure as State Secretary would eventually span a longer period of time than any of the other State Secretaries of the Minnesota organization for whom records still exist. In the 1904 election, Nash won 1.91 percent of the vote, more than doubling his finish from 1902. However, it probably stands to reason that a large part of Nash's improved finish in 1904 was from riding Eugene V. Debs' coattails—the perennial Socialist presidential nominee, won nearly four percent of the vote in Minnesota during the 1904 presidential election. The party's candidates in elections held in Minnesota in 1904 generally outperformed the slate from 1902 by a large margin. During Nash's tenure as State Secretary, however, the party in Minnesota sustained impressive growth. In 1905—just one year after Nash assumed the position of State Secretary—the Public Ownership (Socialist) Party of Minnesota averaged 791 members in good standing; by 1908, that number had more than doubled, to 1,837. In July 1914—just two years after Nash left office as State Secretary—the Socialist Party of Minnesota peaked at 5,600 members in good standing. And the strides made also translated into increases in electoral strength. In 1904, Debs won 3.99 percent for President in Minnesota; in 1912, Debs won 8.23 percent of the state's vote and carried Lake and Beltrami counties. In 1904, neither of the party's two candidates for the United States House of Representatives from Minnesota won more than 7.44 percent of the vote; in 1912, five of the party's seven congressional candidates won more than ten percent of the vote, with Michael A. Brattland winning 33.28 percent of the vote in the 9th district, Morris Kaplan winning 18.31 percent in the 8th district, Thomas E. Latimer winning 17.17 percent in the 5th district, Albert Rosenquist winning 14.32 percent in the 4th district, and James S. Ingalls winning 10.73 percent running in the at-large district. In 1912, David Morgan's share of the vote for Governor was more than four times greater than Nash's share had been in 1904. The party in Minnesota also began to experience outright victories during the middle and latter half of Nash's tenure as State Secretary: In 1908, Adolf Evensen Ousdahl was elected Mayor of Brainerd. In 1910, J. C. Dahl was elected Mayor of Sr. Hilaire, James Sturdevant was elected Mayor of Tenstrike, and Nels S. Hillman of Two Harbors became the first member of the Socialist Party to be elected to the Minnesota Legislature. In 1912, Hillman was re-elected to the Legislature, Ousdahl was elected to a non-consecutive second term as Mayor of Brainerd, and H. L. Larson and Fred Mahlzan were elected Mayor of Crookston and Bemidji, respectively.  Later years and death  After serving for eight years as the State Secretary of the party, Nash left office in 1912, being succeeded by future-Minneapolis Mayor Thomas E. Latimer. Nash ran as a candidate in that year's election for the office of State Treasurer, winning 36,424 votes, or 12.65 percent. He also took to the speakers' circuit, giving speeches to the various Locals in the state. Nash again ran for the office of State Treasurer in 1914, winning 28,486 votes (8.96 percent). Less than a year after his final electoral appearance, Nash was mortally injured when, on July 30, 1915,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \\"Pedigree Resource File,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:2:33G6-1YN : accessed 2016-12-07), entry for Jay Elijah /Nash/. he was thrown from his wagon. 72 years old at the time of his death, he was survived by his wife, Clara, his sons, George and Floyd, and his daughter, Ruby.

Early life and education Shakya was born in Kathmandu in 1954. She was born on the eighth day of Dashain festival on the day culturally known as Astami, which is how she got her name. She was a second child among eight in a Newar family at Jhochhen, near Hanumandhoka Durbar Square. After the completion of School Leaving Certificate in 1972 she joined a Chinese language class at Basantapur with her friend Sulochana Manandhar, who is now a writer. The two girls were often seen doing quite unusual activities for girls in those days – like riding bicycles or driving cars, swimming and doing physical exercises. Shakya went to Ratna Rajya Luxmi College for her further education but dropped out from what she saw as \\"bourgeois education\\" after four years. She started studying Chinese from which she learned about communism from her teacher Mahesh Man Shrestha, a leftist intellectual and a physician. She was quite impressed by the life and contribution of Mao Tse-tung and read articles on struggles by women activists in China during the revolution. After having observed Shakya's suspicious activities her parents decided to arrange a marriage for her. With the help of her sister Sunita and her friend Sulochana, she made a plan to quit her home and devote her life for the party. In 1980, she ran away from home to avoid the marriage. After leaving her home, she joined the CPN-ML. Political career Shakya and her colleagues in a Chinese language class formed a group of around sixty youths to continue to work to change their society through activities, such as visiting villages to teach the people about communism and publishing booklets on revolutions and communist leaders. Without having connection with any political party they worked for three years. Her profession as a teacher helped her to participate in those activities as she could tell her parents that she would go to villages for her school work. In 1980, she left her home, pretending to go to attend a feast at her friend's house. Before that her important books and documents had already been carried out. She had collected all her photos which were with her relatives and burnt them. She donated all her belongings, including expensive jewels, to the party and took a vow to obey the party directives. At that time the party in-charge of the CPN (ML) in Bagmati Zone was Amrit Kumar Bohara who later became her life partner. Soon after she entered into her underground life, Shakya had to face a kind of test to prove that she was not an ordinary comfort-seeking city-dweller but could struggle for others' cause. Her party assigned her to work in Piskar village of Sindhupalchowk district, located in the eastern side of the Kathmandu Valley. She worked in Piskar for two years to establish the party organization. She stayed in the community of Thamis, ethnic minorities who live in the area. While staying there she lived in a cave for three months. She taught villagers reading and writing and about public health. Shakya spent eleven years of underground life in different places of the country before the multi-party system was restored in 1990. She had stayed in Panga of Kirtipur, in Tokha of Kathmandu as well as in Ilam and Jhapa districts in eastern Nepal. In 1984 she became a district committee member of Jhapa and in-charge of All Nepal Women Association in Mechi Zone. In 1988 she became a member of Mechi Zonal Committee. =Arrest= Shakya was arrested for some times during her underground period. While she was detained in Ilam Jail her father came to see her from Kathmandu after many years. She was released only after the restoration of democracy in 1990. =Party roles= Shakya was given various responsibilities by her party to head Muslim Ittehad Organization, Central Law Department and Parliamentary Hearing Committee. She also played an important role to establish the women organization in her party. In February 1981 she, along with Gaura Prasai, Sushila Shrestha and others, organized a secret conference of women cadres of the CPN (ML) in Hetauda, where All Nepal Women Association was reformed to become more active. In this conference Shanta Manavi was elected as a president. Shakya was elected as a member of House of Representatives from a constituency in Kathmandu in the 1999 Nepalese legislative election. She also became Minister of Women, Children and Social Welfare in the coalition government and Minister of Industry and Commerce. Shakya was elected Vice President of the CPN-UML party, from the general convention. She has been the SC member of JOMPOPS since its formation in early 2010 and was the first elected Chairperson of the JOMPOPS platform. Shakya was also elected as a Constituent Assembly Member in November 2014. In 2015, she turned down the nomination of Labour minister to give other politicians a chance to work at the position. Personal life In 1981, Shakya married Amrit Kumar Bohara who is now a member of Standing Committee of the CPN- UML. They both applied in their party for marriage and the party decided to grant them permission. She has two children, a son and a daughter. Both spent most of their childhood at her friends' houses, growing up separately in different places.

It is noted mainly as the only 'Adithya' (Hindu solar deity) shrine in the state. The temple is situated just from the main highway leading to Vaikom. It is about 3 km from Kaduthuruthy, 17 km from Ettumanoor and 16 km from Vaikom.  Legend  Legend has it that the idol of Surya Deva was consecrated during the Treta Yuga. But there are no much factual evidences behind the origin of the temple. Once a Nambudiri who belonged to the 'Kapikkadu Marangattu Mana' performed a deep meditation or 'Tapas' to please the Sun God 'Adithya'. Pleased by the devotion, Adithya appeared before him and instructed him to consecrate an idol in the place. From that time onwards, regular pujas and rituals were started. At present, descendants of that Nambudiri holds the tantric rights of the temple.  Temple  The 'Sreekovil' or the sanctum sanctorum of the temple is in a circular shape. The idol faces west with a meditative posture. It is made of a special kind of stone that has the capability to absorbe oil. 'Abhishekam' or the holy bathing of idol is performed in morning followed by the abhishekam of water. It is really a wonder that there will be no presence of oil after sprinkling water in the idol. The upper right hand holds the 'Chakra' (rotating disk) and the upper left hand holds the 'Shankha' (conch) and the lower right and left hands are in a 'tapo mudra' posture. An interesting fact is that there are no 'Navagraha' pratishtas here.  Poojas  Adithyapooja (for curing eye and skin related diseases), Udayasthamana pooja, Enna (oil) Abhishekam, Bhagavathi pooja and Navagraha (9 planet deities) pooja are the most important poojas in the temple.  Offerings  'Ada Nivedyam' and 'Raktha Chandana samarppanam' are the main offerings often done to cure diseases.  Festivals  The last Sundays of Malayalam months 'Vrishchikam' (October and November) and 'Medam' (May and June) are considered to be the most propitious days.  Rituals  Special rituals such as 'Abhishekam' and 'Rakthachandana Kaavadi' are performed on the festive occasions. There is also a custom that one member from the Marangattu Illam must participate in the Kaavadi.  Deities  Apart from Surya Deva, Devi (facing east), Sastha and Yakshi are the sub deities.

In 1920, she moved to Constantinople, commencing work at the American College for Girls, as well as teaching at Zappeion Teachers College and the Stavrodromiou Central School for Girls. She married Kostas Stylianopoulos in London in 1922. In the wake of the Catastrophe, they moved to Athens in 1923. Lambridi was appointed headmistress at the American College for Girls in Athens, where she organised the programme for the Greek department. Her daughter, Nike, was born in 1923; however, the couple were divorced soon afterwards.Hatzi, Elli Lambridi and Nike, 231; Garitsis, Elli Lambridi, pp. 19-20 Lambridi continued teaching and became engaged in philosophical and political issues. In 1926, she travelled to Paris as an envoy of the Free Press newspaper to participate in the 10th Congress of the International Alliance for Women's Vote. In 1928, she resigned from the College in Athens and over the following two years dedicated herself to philosophical research and writing . Among other projects, she undertook a philosophical series for Ellinika Philla, wrote numerous essays on philosophy and psychology for the periodical Anagennisi and philosophical entries for an encyclopaedia. In 1929, she published Bergson and his Philosophy, and The Aegean: Cretan-Mycenean Political Structure. In 1930, she travelled to Prague to attend the Congress of the International Federation of University Women.Garitsis, Elli Lambridi, p. 21 Lambridi returned to teaching in 1930, having been appointed Deputy Director of Teaching at Marasleio Teachers College. In 1931, she travelled to America to attend the Congress of the International Federation of University Women. In 1932, she was Deputy Director, first at Tripoli and then at Lamia Teachers Colleges. Her formal pedagogical career ended when she was forced to leave her position in July 1935, for political reasons, following the failed attempt by Venizelos to regain power. Lambridi worked as a private teacher in Athens, but devoted her time to studying and writing philosophy. She attended soirees in Kydhathineon Street, Plaka, Athens (the home of Konstantinos Tsatsos, later President of Greece), and in 1937-1939 presented a series of lectures in philosophy at the cultural association, Askraios.K. Despotopolous, Foreword to Elli Lambridi, Introduction to Philosophy, p. 7; Hatzi, 'Emies', p. 363 These were very successful, attracting large audiences, and from these courses eventually came her Introduction to Philosophy (1965, 2004). In 1939, she published an extended critical review of the Odyssey by Kazantzakis in Neohellenica Grammata (Modern Greek Literature) which drew a hostile response.Bien, Kazantzakis v. 1, pp. 139, 194; Bien, Kazantzakis v. 2, p. 36; Garitsis, Elli Lambridi, p. 62 She also published many other articles in various literary and philosophical publications.  War years  Lambridi received a scholarship from the British Council to study the English education system at London's Institute of Education and arrived in London in September, 1939. As well as her studies, she also attended lectures by Wittgenstein at Cambridge. The occupation of Europe during the war stopped her returning to Greece, and she offered her services to the Greek Government in exile in London, and in 1941 was appointed Director of the Ministry of Information, undertaking various activities, including BBC interviews, producing newsletters and teaching Greek to English SAS officers to be engaged in the Greek resistance movement.Hatzi, 'Emeis', p. 364 Lambridi returned to Greece in early 1945, only to be informed that her daughter, who had spent the war with family and friends, had been hit by shrapnel from a British mortar a few days earlier. The ambulance carrying Niki to hospital had then been bombed. She died on 3 Jan 1945, aged 22, an innocent victim of the Dekemvriana.Hatzi, Elli Lambridi and Nike, p. 232 Lambridi later published an account of her daughter's life told in parallel to contemporary Greek history entitled Nike (Victory). Lambridi remained in Greece for about a year before returning to the UK. While in London, she became a member of the League for Democracy in Greece and sat on the Board with ten British Labour MPs.Garitsis, Elli Lambridi, p. 25 As a result of her association with the League, her passport was confiscated by the Greek Government in 1947 and she remained in London for another ten years. During this time she continued to write, working on Nike, other fictional works, various philosophical projects and translations.Hatzi, 'Emeis', pp. 364-365  Return to Greece  After regaining her passport, she was able to return to Greece in 1960, where she published Nike and continued work on a number of philosophical and literary projects. She also became a member of the Socialist Democratic Union (SDE) and, in the 1964 election, was nominated as a candidate by the Socialist Party/Greek Popular Movement for Independence. In 1964, she became a member of the Société Européenne de Culture and in 1965 she travelled to Russia to participate in the Conference of the International Federation of Democratic Women.Hatzi, 'Emeis', p. 364-365; Garitsis, Elli Lambridi, pp. 27-28 In 1967, the military dictatorship (21 April 1967 to 23 July 1974) cancelled her passport and banned the publication of the second volume of Introduction to Philosophy. In her later years, she produced a manuscript on Empedocles in English (published posthumously in the US) and was contracted to produce another work on Protagoras. She died in Athens on 28 January 1970 and is buried in the First Cemetery.Hatzi, 'Emeis', p. 365  The Elli Lambridi Library  At Lambridi's request, the Elli Lambridi Philosophical Library was established after her death by the Academy of Athens and her brothers in Ypsilanto Street, Kolonaki, Athens on the basis of a small legacy and with the help of her executors. In her will, she explained that \\"philosophy and philosophical education was completely neglected in Greece, and although she had studied philosophy constantly, she had not completed her mission, which was to make philosophy the ultimate purpose of her life\\". The library is administered by the Academy of Athens and contains Lambridi's personal collection which ranges from logic and analytic philosophy to the history of religion and a general range of philosophy texts in Greek, German, French and English.Bien, Kazantzakis, p. 263, n. 25 The library also holds many other philosophical works. Among Lambridi's manuscripts is a comprehensive history of ancient Greek philosophy and many works on modern analytic philosophy, as well as papers on Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and others and the unfinished Fantasia Philosophica.

It was named by archaeologist Louis Leakey after Lake Elmenteita (also Elementaita), a soda lake located in the Great Rift Valley, about northwest of Nairobi. History of research The Elmenteitan was first described by Louis Leakey from excavations at Gamble's Cave (the type site) in 1931 and Njoro River Cave in 1938. Leakey had noticed a locally distinct cluster of the lithic industry and a universal pottery tradition in a restricted area on the plains west of the central Great Rift Valley and at the Mau Escarpment. Artefacts and characteristics Grinding stones, pestles and axes of the East African Pastoral Neolithic At Elmenteitan sites, lithic assemblages are distinguished by a high percentage of long symmetrical two-edged obsidian blades which were used unmodified and also served as blanks for a great variety of smaller microlithic tools. Typical Elmenteitan artifact assemblages also include ceramic bowls and shallow stone vessels. Ceramic vessels are mainly undecorated. Several rare, but very distinctive ornamental designs such as irregular punctuation and rim millings have also been found. Occasionally small bowls with out-turned rims, handles with holes or horizontal lugs have been discovered as well. Domestic cattle and small stock were raised and herded in combination with hunting, fishing and foraging. Patterns and degree of subsistence economy varied greatly depending on location and local and temporal climate. Regular cremation of the dead took place in caves (e.g. Egerton Cave, Keringet Caves). Njoro River Cave, first excavated in 1938 by Mary Leakey, served as a mass-burial site. Associated finds include beads, blades, stone bowls, palettes and pottery vessels. Physical anthropology Instances of dental avulsion in some individuals from Elmenteitan burial sites has led to associations with the early spread of Southern Nlotic speaking groups into south-western Kenya. The exact direction from which they entered southern Kenya remains unclear.The Technological and Socio-Economic Organization of the Elmenteitan Early Herders in Southern Kenya (3000-1200 BP), Goldstein, S.T., Washington University in Saint Louis, p.31 Recent genetic analysis of the ancient remains of Elmenteitan has proven that the population of the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic were also responsible for the pastoralist Elmenteitan culture that lived in the Rift Valley during the same period.M.

She and her husband, both National Institute of Design Alumni, co-founded Menstrupedia Comic in 2012. In 2014, she was named in the Forbes India 30 Under 30 2014 list.  Early life  Aditi Gupta is a 34-year-old engineering graduate and a New Media Design post-graduate from National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. She was born in Garhwa in Jharkhand, India. She started menstruating at the age of 12, but only learnt about menstruation when she was taught about it in class 9 at the age of 15. In her childhood, when she was menstruating she was not allowed to touch a place of worship, or sit on other people’s beds; she had to wash and dry her clothes separately. She was not allowed to use the sanitary napkins available in the market as buying them would ‘risk the family’s dignity’. She bought her first sanitary napkin at the age of 15. Aditi met her husband, Tuhin Paul in the National Institute of Design where they both worked on several projects together. They found a severe lack of awareness about menstruation even among the most educated people, and that many still believed and followed menstrual myths.  Career  The lack of awareness and education about menstruation motivated her to undergo research on the subject for one year. She collated information from doctors and girls which gave her an idea to start a comic book with three young girls and a doctor as the main characters. She put up the comic books on a website (www.talesofchange.in). In November 2012, Gupta and her husband, Paul started Menstrupedia to spread more knowledge and awareness about the subject. It originally began as a thesis project while they were in National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. The website has developed into a platform ‘providing information on puberty and sexuality for pre-teens and teenagers.’ Menstrupedia provides a user-friendly guide to menstruation, hygiene and puberty and helps break myths associated to them. The aim of the website is to present this information in a culturally sensitive and an easy-to-understand way through digital media. The website contains various comic books, blogs, Q&A; section and a Learn section. The comics are available in fourteen languages and has been utilised in more than 18 countries. Gupta prepared the materials used in schools in five states of North India currently. Gupta distributed these comics, in schools in Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad and Ranchi, where the girls, their parents and teachers liked them a lot. Menstrupedia has started several campaigns in collaboration with Whisper India such as Touch the Pickle movement in collaboration with many actresses like Shraddha Kapoor, Parineeti Chopra, Kalki Koechlin, Neha Dhupia, Mandira Bedi among others. She was listed on the Forbes India U-30 list.  Critical reception  Aditi’s work was initially criticized for discussing a taboo subject. However it was received positively by the majority online and by the media. Menstrupedia receives one lakh visitors every month. Her comic books have been used by NGOs like Protsahan, Munshi Jagannath Bhagwan Smriti Sansthan, Instincts, Kanha along with two Buddhists monasteries in Ladakh. She received criticisms from a Hindu religious leader saying “They might be doing good but they don’t know anything about religion.”  References  External links *Aditi Gupta: A taboo-free way to talk about periods - TED Talk *Menstrupedia - GraphicShelf Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Indian comics writers Indian writers Indian businesspeople Menstrual cycle People from Garhwa district National Institute of Design alumni ","title":"Aditi Gupta (author)"},{"id":"52513602","text":"This is a list of Bulgarian football transfers for the 2016–17 winter transfer window.

Harper spent eight seasons in the Washington Nationals organization. He is the older brother of Phillies outfielder Bryce Harper. Early life Growing up in Las Vegas, Nevada, Harper played a number of sports, including basketball and American football as well as baseball. Bryce Harper has said that the reason he bats left-handed is because he always wanted to be like his older brother, who throws left-handed. The younger Harper said he tried throwing left-handed when he was young, but being naturally right-handed, he was \\"terrible\\" at it, so he settled for hitting from the left side instead. Baseball career =High school and college= Harper attended Las Vegas High School, pitching for the school's baseball team. He was drafted in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft in the 31st round by the Washington Nationals, but he chose not to sign. After graduating from high school, Harper briefly relocated out-of-state to pitch at California State University, Northridge, for the Cal State Northridge Matadors before transferring back to Las Vegas to attend the College of Southern Nevada. The Harper brothers were teammates on the Las Vegas High baseball team as well as at Southern Nevada, a junior college that Bryce Harper attended early so that he could sign with a major league team as quickly as possible. At the time, Bryce was a catcher, so the Harper brothers would often form the Coyotes' battery. On the Coyotes baseball team, they were managed by Tim Chambers, who later praised Bryan Harper's work ethic and professionalism in spite of being overshadowed by his younger brother. Harper acknowledged in a 2015 interview that he has \\"never been the uber-prospect like my brother has\\", but he said he focused on his pitching and was consistently able to get batters out. Bryan Harper pitched in the 2010 JUCO World Series, with Bryce Harper as his catcher, earning the win in an 18-1 blowout of Faulkner State Community College in the second round of the tournament. After Bryce was ejected and suspended later in the tournament, Bryan Harper got to pitch in an elimination game versus Iowa Western Community College. While the Coyotes led into the ninth inning, the team's closer gave up a walk-off home run, ending their playoff run. The Harper brothers spent just one year together at Southern Nevada before Bryce was drafted in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. Although Chambers hoped Bryan Harper would be picked up by the Nationals again in a later round of the draft, believing he could help his younger brother make the transition to professional baseball, he was ultimately selected in the 27th round by the Chicago Cubs. While Bryce Harper, having been taken by the Nationals with the first overall draft pick, chose to sign and become a member of the Nationals organization, Bryan Harper declined to sign with the Cubs. He instead went to the University of South Carolina, where he pitched in relief for the Gamecocks as a setup man. He won the 2011 College World Series with South Carolina. During that 2011 season with South Carolina, he recorded a 5.40 ERA over 18 1/3 innings. He later admitted he \\"didn't pitch the best\\" as a Gamecock, but he said the additional year of college helped with his maturity. =Washington Nationals= Harper was originally drafted by the Nationals in the 31st round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft out of Las Vegas High School, but he chose not to sign. He was then drafted in the 27th round of the 2010 MLB draft—in which his younger brother Bryce was selected first overall by the Nationals—by the Chicago Cubs out of the College of Southern Nevada but again did not sign. After Harper transferred to the University of South Carolina, he was drafted again by the Nationals in the 2011 MLB draft in the 30th round. Feeling he was ready at that point to play professionally, he agreed to terms, joining his brother in the organization. While Bryce Harper, who was quickly converted from catching to playing in the outfield, shot through the Nationals organization—he made his major league debut in April 2012—Bryan Harper's progression was slower. He spent the 2012 season with the Low-A Auburn Doubledays and the 2013 season with the Class-A Hagerstown Suns, working exclusively out of the bullpen. Starting in the 2014 season, he began to advance into the high minor leagues, ending the year with the Class-AA Harrisburg Senators and appearing briefly in the 2015 season with the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, a step away from the major leagues. After spending the first two months of the 2016 season back with the Senators and recording a 1.50 ERA over 24 innings pitched, including 16 out of 20 scoreless appearances, Harper was promoted again to the Chiefs in June. After pitching to a 2.95 ERA over 21 1/3 innings with the Chiefs in 2016, Harper was shut down in August with a forearm strain. He was ruled out for the season, ending any chance of being called up to the Nationals that year, and in November, he underwent Tommy John surgery, an operation expected to rule him out for the 2017 season as well. As a result of the surgery, he was not added to the 40-man roster after the 2016 season as had been previously expected, according to The Washington Post. Harper re-signed with the Nationals after the 2017 season and was invited to major league spring training in 2018 for the first time, vying for a spot in the Washington bullpen. He spent the 2018 regular season with Harrisburg, making 44 relief appearances. He became a free agent following the season. =Lancaster Barnstormers= On March 22, 2019, Harper signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. Pitching style At 6-foot-5, Bryan Harper stands two inches taller than Bryce Harper. Unlike Bryce, he throws left-handed. While his fastball velocity sat in the mid-80s when he was pitching for the University of South Carolina in 2011, he was throwing in the low 90s with the Syracuse Chiefs in 2016 prior to undergoing Tommy John surgery. His pitching arsenal includes a fastball, curveball, slider, and changeup.

Currently based in Sydney, Australia, and Visual Arts Curator at Blacktown Arts Centre. Recent projects include diaspora-making machines exhibition; It's Our Thing: More History on Australian Hip-Hop program curated with Kon Gouriotis and Maria Mitar; It's Timely touring exhibition curated with Gary Carsley; Riverstones and Ramifications: Bronwyn Bancroft; Stitching the Sea exhibition curated with Karen Ruki; UNCOVERED: Hidden Pleasure of the Day exhibition; and Native Institute exhibition curated with Brook Andrew. AquaVoltaic is an international touring exhibition created with David Matthews. The Australian version was exhibited with the latest episode at The Lock-Up contemporary arts space in 2015. In the UK the exhibition toured with additional episodes created for each venue installation: B-Side Festival 2012 Cultural Olympiad; Metal Liverpool; and Metal Southend. The project was produced with artist curator Simon Poulter. AquaVoltaic is a commentary on the commercial use and abuse of water, and a satire of globalisation and popular media. After buying a consignment of water from a shady Nigerian in Sierra Leone, quixotic Afro-Caribbean businessman John Jay-Jay Joseph attempts to smuggle his booty through Essex and London to Outback Australia, where he intends to sell it to a mysterious Aboriginal tribe with magical realist ambitions. But when Jay-Jay's bizarre plans go awry, the transaction between him and the other ethnics unravels a darkly comic tale that raises questions about racial stereotyping, global trade, and the mutating qualities of water. Rush Hour was a UK national touring exhibition in 2007 to coincide with the 200 year anniversary of the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade Act in the British Empire, created with David Matthews. The picture was shot as a single-take in Siaka Stevens Street in Freetown and the soundtrack recorded at the Sierra Leone State Television Studios with the street theatre group, The Freetong Players. Rush Hour was shown at HPF2011 and in 2010 at the inaugural exhibition entitled 'Plug-In' at MAC (Midlands Arts Centre). Curator Simon Poulter commented: \\"Rush Hour gives the exhibition a true sense of globalisation at work. A single tracking shot courses through a static crowd in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The film beautifully encapsulates Marshall McLuhan's idea of the global village, where we see western influences alongside truly local culture.\\" Other notable works include Starship Enterprise, a seven-minute animation and limited edition print, and Restoration, a five-minute animation and limited edition print, exhibited at Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, Ormeau Baths Gallery, Belfast, Substation, Singapore and Muse London, from 2005 to 2007. The Museum of London Docklands permanent exhibition, London, Sugar and Slavery, reveals how London's involvement in slavery has shaped the capital since the 17th century, and challenges perceptions about the transatlantic slave trade. Paul Howard's commission for the permanent gallery is a contemporised portrait of the son of a slave, revolutionary and abolitionist, Robert Wedderburn, and is based on the Museum's painting of the first chairman of the West India Dock Company and slave owner Sir George Hibbert. Lloyd Gordon as Robert Wedderburn was reviewed in The Guardian and The Independent. Paul Howard was Curator at Tate Modern from 2003 to 2008. He led the UK national collections initiative across the Tate galleries in London, Liverpool and St Ives, from 2003 to 2006, and led the pan-European programme of modern and contemporary art with the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Serralves Museum, Porto, Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb, National Gallery of Modern Art, Prague, Centre of Contemporary Art, Warsaw and the Pinokotek Moderne, Munich from 2006 to 2008.

She was Deputy General Secretary of General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT) in 2004–08. Early life and education Pandey was born in Rawalswara, Khanigaun Village Development Committee in Nuwakot District, the second youngest of twelve.

She has two master's degrees in Gender and Development Studies and in Botany, as well as two bachelor's degrees in Education and in Law. She has completed her PhD from School of Education of Kathmandu University in 2017. =Student politics= On March 27, 1981, on the day of a general strike, a rally was organized by students at her school against then autocratic Panchayat rule. One of the demands of students was to release student activists who had been arrested in Kathmandu some days before, one of whom was her youngest elder brother. She took part in a rally walking in the front row, chanting anti- Panchayat slogans. After the elections of Free Student Unions were held in 1981, in which Pandey's panel won, a district level convention of the All Nepal National Free Students' Union (ANNFSU) was held and she was elected as a treasurer. Later, she and her comrades had a dispute with a school principal and she went to Kathmandu to continue her studies. In Kathmandu she joined Kanti Ishwori Secondary School. Career Pandey was involved in the Student movement for more than a decade from 1980 to 1992. In 1992, she joined the All Nepal Women Association(ANWA) which was affiliated with the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) CPN(UML). She was elected as a treasurer of ANWA in November 1992. She was given a responsibility to organize women laborers through its Central Women Workers Department (CWWD) of General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions (GEFONT).

She was elected as a member of the Constitution Assembly through the proportional representation of the CPN (UML). She, along with other feminist members in the assembly, protested when the Nepali word Rashtrapati was used for President, for its male-centric connotation. The group had proposed to replace the title with another word Rashtradhyachhya but it is yet to be implemented. She has said that the job of making all the members convince on women's issues is tougher than taking women's issues to the streets. but says she will \\"continue to fight to make the coming constitution really sensitive to gender issue\\".

Typical applications are generally found where power needs to be varied and ultimately converted into thermal energy. For example, the controllers are used in industrial furnace construction or in plastic processing.  How it works  Thyristor power controllers are operated with an alternating voltage in single-phase or three-phase. They are controlled by a controller and vary the activation time of the mains voltage for the load. Where the operating conditions do not require otherwise, the pulse group operation is recommended. Here, whole mains voltage shafts are switched to the load or blocked. For example, a controller requires 60% output (via a 4-20 mA signal, which corresponds to 0-100%). The thyristor power controller switches 60% of the solid waves to the load while blocking 40%. The operating mode is to be regarded as unproblematic. Only in the case of a too weakly designed network, it is possible for illuminating installations which are connected to the same network to have undesired luminance fluctuations (flicker effect). Some operating conditions require switching in each half-wave and thus very fast operation. Examples are control sections with very fast behavior or a required current limitation with low element resistance in the cold state. In this operating mode, the controller changes the phase angle α of the thyristor ignition timing. A half wave corresponds to 180 ° el. (electrical degree). The actuator can adjust the phase angle of 0 ° el. (maximum power) up to 180 ° el. (no power). In a 50 Hz mains the controller switches every 20 ms and shows very fast behavior. As a result of the voltage flanks during switch-on, disadvantages such as EMC interference potential or control voltage output also result in ohmic loads. This situation must be counteracted by means of line filters or the corresponding plant size with compensating systems.  Underlying control  As mentioned, the controllers change their on-off ratio due to the degree of regulation. With a required output of 50%, the controller would switch off a full wave and a full wave in the pulse group mode. Only in the light of this situation, changes in output voltage fluctuate during mains voltage fluctuations. In fact, the operators have a subordinate regulation. In the most complex case, they vary the output power proportionally to the degree of regulation. For mains voltage changes, the controllers react with the variation of the switch-on and switch-off ratio.  Monitoring of heating elements  In addition to the current limitation, thyristor power controllers offer additional functionalities for monitoring and / or protecting the elements: Heating elements are often operated in parallel. The partial breakage monitoring signals the breakage of a heating element. The heating element can be replaced at the next plant shutdown. R-Control limits the temperature of temperature-sensitive heating elements. Most of the heating elements are thermistors, they increase the resistance with the temperature.

They are also known as panel mounted, discrete or dedicated controllers. The controllers can be easily configured and to control most types of control loop. Simple versions have a numerical display of the process values. Compact controllers in high-end equipment are available with touchscreen and graphical representation of the control loop or the system. In addition to the actual control loop, compact controllers can also take over control tasks and thus control the process sequence or parts thereof independently. Compact controllers can be found in almost all industries. For example, the program controller function is often used in the food industry, or in hardening to define specific temperature profiles.  Construction  Panel mounted controllers with integral hard displays. The process value (PV), and setvalue (SV) or setpoint are on the same scale for easy comparison. The controller output CO is shown as MV (Manipulated variable) range 0-100% valve positioner ensures correct valve operation. Compact controllers are either fixed or modular and can therefore be extended. The inputs for the actual value are often universal and can be configured for different types of sensors and signals. Digital inputs are also available for the detection of switching operations. Various binary switching elements are available as outputs, such as relay, semiconductor relay, logic and MosFET outputs, and are used either for controlling binary actuators or for control signals. The analog outputs can be configured as voltage or current output, e.g. 4 ... 20 mA / 0 ... 10 V and are used for the continuous control of analog actuators such as, for example, control valves, thyristor power controllers or frequency converters. The operation, parameterization and configuration can be carried out via the device front, in addition, configuration programs are supplied in which the settings for the user can be clearly arranged.

Praveena was introduced to social work by her mother, who worked closely with social worker Sarojini Varadappan.  Career  She joined the NGO named Indian Community Welfare Organisation in 2004 working as a field officer and was educating underprivileged children and sex workers. For Solomon, handling the crematorium is another service. In March 2014, ICWO won the contract to run the 120-year-old Valankadu crematorium. Praveena, as caretaker of the crematorium faced initial challenges, as some of them even threatened with acid attack. Initially she did not have the support of the local people as they were also perturbed to see a woman handled the affairs of the dead. Eventually, she managed to win over the people's hearts, courtesy a combination of support from the police and her own hard efforts. Solomon worked untiringly to change the looks of crematorium that looked ugly when she took over its affairs more than two years ago. Now people say it looks like a park.

It was released on June 29, 2018 for Windows and is rated for all ages. Summer Pockets is Key's 13th game, along with other titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad. It has been ported to iOS and Android devices, and the Nintendo Switch. An English version for Windows was released by Visual Arts in 2020. An expanded version of the game titled Summer Pockets Reflection Blue was also released on June 26, 2020 in Japan. The story is set on a fictional island on the Seto Inland Sea and follows the life of Hairi Takahara, a young man who uses the recent death of his grandmother as an excuse to escape to the island after an unpleasant incident. Once there, he gets to know the townsfolk of Torishirojima and multiple girls who are the focus of the story. The game's concept is by Jun Maeda, who felt that the game needed to make readers cry. Kai was brought in to direct the project, as well as co-write the scenario with Hasama and Yū Niijima. Maeda decided not to write the scenario due to similarities in themes with Key's visual novel Air, which he primarily wrote. Although Air also features a rural, seaside setting during the summer, the development team aimed for Summer Pockets to have a different feeling to it. Nostalgia and the maternal bond are prominent themes in the game. Na-Ga is the chief artist and character designer, and additional character designs are provided by Tsubasu Izumi, Yūnon Nagayama and Fumuyun. The game's soundtrack was composed by Maeda, Shinji Orito, Donmaru, Tomohiro Takeshita and Ryō Mizutsuki. Synopsis Summer Pockets is set on an isolated, rural and peaceful island on the Seto Inland Sea called Torishirojima, which has a population of about 2,000 people. The protagonist is Hairi Takahara, a young man not native to the island. Hairi grew up in an urban setting, but after an unpleasant incident, he uses the recent death of his grandmother as an excuse to come to the island to take care of her estate sale. Once there, he gets to know four girls who are the focus of the story. They include Shiroha Naruse, who forgot her summer vacation; Ao Sorakado, who is pursuing the legends of the island; Kamome Kushima, a high-class girl looking for a pirate ship; and Tsumugi Wenders, a younger girl trying to find herself. Characters =Main= ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : =Others= ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : Development Before the production of Summer Pockets began, Key was in the process of developing Angel Beats! 1st Beat (2015) and Harmonia (2016). At that time in early 2015, scenario writer Yūto Tonokawa was leading a new project for another visual novel, but this project was postponed to focus on Angel Beats! and Harmonia. Tonokawa later resigned from Key prior to the release of Angel Beats! 1st Beat in June 2015, and the project he was leading was subsequently abandoned. Following this, Kai was brought in to direct a new project, which would later become Summer Pockets. An in-house competition among Visual Arts employees was conducted to submit ideas for the new project as long as it was based around a concept involving an enjoyable, everyday life and a tearful story, but otherwise not being constrained by previous works by Key. When discussion began regarding Key's new work, Jun Maeda talked it over with Takahiro Baba, the president of Visual Arts, and Maeda was adamant that the new project needed to make readers cry. Maeda went on to say that if their next work could not achieve that, it would mean the end for Key. Among the ideas was one submitted by scenario writer Yū Niijima described as similar to Ghost in the Shell by Kai. Although there were many ideas submitted, it was felt that they were all somewhat lacking as something produced by Key. Maeda admitted that although there were interesting ideas submitted, none of them would make readers cry. Despite Maeda not originally planning to submit an idea himself, he offered one as an example, but he was surprised when his idea was instantly accepted as the basis for what would become Summer Pockets. Maeda decided not to write the scenario for the game due to similarities in themes with Key's visual novel Air (2000), which he primarily wrote. Kai began expanding on the concept with Maeda sitting in on production meetings, but Maeda was later hospitalized, leading Kai to request that more writers be brought on for the project. Niijima had previously worked on visual novels for Saga Planets, another brand under Visual Arts, but he resigned from Saga Planets in 2012. Baba had suggested on multiple occasions that they bring in Niijima for a new project, leading to him being brought in as a scenario writer. Another scenario writer, Hasama, was added following his contributions to the scenario of the ports of Key's visual novel Kud Wafter (2010). Although the game is set on a fictional island, it features locations based on real places; the development staff went to Naoshima, Megijima and Ogijima to aid in this process. The use of nostalgia as a theme was important for Kai who likened Maeda's concept to the Boku no Natsuyasumi video game series. In addressing concerns about its similarity to Air, which also features a rural, seaside setting during the summer, Kai noted that Summer Pockets will have a completely different feeling to it due in part to the relationships the heroines have among each other and also from several charming male characters being featured in the game, similar to that of Little Busters! (2007) and Angel Beats! (2010). However, Maeda pointed out that the theme of the maternal bond featured in Air is also included in Summer Pockets. Na-Ga is the chief artist and character designer for Summer Pockets, and three other artists were later brought in to produce additional character designs: Yūnon Nagayama, Tsubasu Izumi and Fumuyun. Nagayama had previously worked on the character design for Angel Beats! 1st Beat, and she was asked to join the staff for Summer Pockets due to her art being highly compatible with Na-Ga's illustrations. Kai was introduced to Izumi by Harumi Sakurai, the voice of Yuri Nakamura from Angel Beats!, and Kai had wanted to work with Izumi on a project for some time. Fumuyun joined the staff to provide character designs for two supporting characters. Super deformed characters are designed by Engiyoshi. The game's soundtrack is composed by Key's signature composers, Maeda and Shinji Orito, in addition to Donmaru, Tomohiro Takeshita and Ryō Mizutsuki. =Marketing and release= A nine-episode Internet radio show called featuring Visual Arts president Takahiro Baba was streamed on YouTube from February 27 to March 26, 2018. Leading up to the release of Summer Pockets, 53 artists drew illustrations of the game's characters and offered comments from March 1 to June 29, 2018 to promote the game. A full-color introductory booklet called Summer Pockets Walker was distributed for free at anime and gaming stores across Japan starting on March 30, 2018. To advertise Summer Pockets, J.I.O Create took a 2007 Honda Stream RSZ and made it into an itasha (a car featuring illustrations of anime-styled characters) with images of the game's heroines. The car was driven around and showcased throughout Japan between May 3 and June 8, 2018. The car was put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website on July 26, 2018 and sold for . Illustrator Engiyoshi drew 17 snippets featuring characters from Summer Pockets called from May 14 to July 5, 2018. A series of short stories began to be released on the game's website starting on October 31, 2018 written by the game's scenario writers: Kai, Hasama, and Yū Niijima. The stories, subtitled , each focus on a separate character and feature illustrations by Fumuyun, one of the game's artists. Key released a free game demo of Summer Pockets on April 24, 2018 on the game's official website. Summer Pockets was released on June 29, 2018 as a limited edition version for Windows. The limited edition came bundled with an official guide book titled , a remix album titled Swallow Tale, a rubber coaster, a microfiber cloth, a glow-in-the-dark sticker, and promotional cards from the Weiß Schwarz and Lycèe trading card games. Over two dozen stores in Akihabara and online offered special promotional items if the limited edition version of the game was bought at their store. These items included telephone cards, tapestries, mousepads, posters, a smartphone stand, and four separate drama CDs. Summer Pockets was ported to iOS on December 17, 2018, and to Android on December 21, 2018. Prototype released a version on the Nintendo Switch on June 20, 2019. An English version for Windows was released by Visual Arts on February 5, 2020. =Reflection Blue= An upgraded version of the game titled Summer Pockets Reflection Blue was released on June 26, 2020 for Windows.

The expanded limited edition was also bundled with an art book, an acrylic stand, a mini plush toy of Inari, a T-shirt, a necklace, a book jacket, and a Summer Pockets holographic card set. Originally conceived as a fan disc, Key later decided to release it as a new version of the game with various additions, and it is made by the same staff as the original game. Reflection Blue has four additional heroine routes, three of which are for Miki Nomura, Shizuku Mizuori, and Umi Kato from Summer Pockets, in addition to the new heroine Shiki Kamiyama. There are also new everyday life scenarios featuring the characters interacting and having fun together, and this includes an upgrade to the ping pong minigame. Music Summer Pockets has six pieces of theme music: one opening theme, two ending themes, and three insert songs played during gameplay. The opening theme is sung by Konomi Suzuki. The main ending theme is \\"Lasting Moment\\" sung by Suzuki, and the grand finale ending theme is sung by Rionos.

From 2001, Dehm was director of the Haus der Begegnung (House of Meeting) in Frankfurt where he encouraged hospitality and openness, and a meeting of therapy, education and culture.

She was the editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post South Africa and the Mail & Guardian. She is currently head of digital at South African radio station, POWER 98.7.  Early life  Pillay was born on 11 February 1984 and grew up in Laudium, Pretoria. In 2007 she graduated with an honours degree in journalism from Rhodes University.  Career  Pillay began working as a journalist in January 2007 at News24, after winning a bursary from the publication to complete her honours degree. She later joined the Mail & Guardian in 2009, where she rose quickly within the ranks of the publication. She was an early adopter of digital within journalism, winning two first-time digital categories at traditional journalism awards. In 2012 she won the prestigious CNN African Journalist of the Year award in the inaugural digital journalism category. In 2013 she won the inaugural Standard Bank Sikuvile award for multiplatform journalism. Pillay has written extensively about race and gender. She contributed an essay to the collection, Categories of Persons (2013) about popular culture and language. In 2015 she was appointed as the editor-in-chief of the Mail & Guardian. Pillay was known for creating a strong editorial team and helped the Mail & Guardian grow in circulation. She increased year-on-year total circulation every quarter during her time as editor-in-chief of the M&G;, the only SA newspaper in any category to do so in that period. In 2015 she was selected as one of the BBC’s 100 Women. In 2016 she won the Standard Bank Sikuvile award in the columns/editorial category for a body of her work as a columnist. On 1 November 2016 she was headhunted for the position of editor-in-chief at The Huffington Post (South Africa). After resigning on principle she joined radio station POWER 98.7 as head of digital.  Controversy  In January 2016 Pillay co-wrote an article in the Mail & Guardian quoting sources that claimed Mmusi Maimane, leader of opposition party the Democratic Alliance, had been taking \\"leadership lessons\\" from the country's last apartheid leader FW de Klerk. Pillay later apologised for not taking more steps to verify the allegations and promised to improve processes and admit and fix mistakes quickly in future. Maimane and the DA accepted the apology. In April 2017 the South African edition of the Huffington Post published a now deleted blog headlined \\"Could It Be Time To Deny White Men The Franchise?\\" that suggested white men should be denied the right to vote. Pillay initially defended the purported author behind the piece, who was on the receiving end of sexist attacks, and defended the underlying theme that white men held more power, while saying she did not agree with everything in the blog, in a now deleted article. It subsequently emerged the post had been written by a white man who had wanted to make a point about the lack of fact checking in South African media and who had intentionally based the argument on material errors. Pillay apologised. She resigned on principle on 22 April 2017, following a ruling by the South Africa's Press Ombud that the fake article had amounted to hate speech. HuffPost SA and Media 24 immediately published and complied with the ruling, despite public concerns over its soundness and its definition of hate speech. Pillay appealed the ruling in her personal capacity. A full panel of the appeals board of the Press Ombud overturned that finding, in a closely followed hearing. Following the incident Pillay noted in an interview that while she acknowledged her errors and had resigned because of them, her team had been operating in a stretched newsroom where the publisher insisted on 30 unique pieces of content a day, with three junior reporters. She said requests for sub editors had been turned down and that the blogs editor had been asked to double up as a reporter. The HuffPost SA blogs editor, Sipho Hlongwane, was later made to face a disciplinary hearing but resigned before it took place.

Career  Nirmala was raised in a traditional Indian family and encouraged to go into medical research by her husband. She had the idea of researching the virus from her mentor, Professor Suniti Solomon, in response to formal tracking of HIV in the US, which began in 1982. At the time, HIV was still a taboo subject in the country. Blood samples had been collected from Mumbai and Pune without positive results. The research plan involved taking around 200 samples of blood from groups suspected to be at high risk, including 80 gathered by Nirmala. Because of a lack of testing facilities in Chennai, Solomon arranged for them to be investigated at the Christian Medical College & Hospital in Vellore, away. The samples confirmed that HIV was active in India. The information was transferred to the Indian Council of Medical Research, which told the prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and Tamil Nadu health minister H. V. Hande.

Born into a poor household in Butetown, she won a scholarship to the Lady Margaret High School for Girls in Cardiff. She later trained as a teacher, eventually becoming head teacher of Mount Stuart Primary School in Butetown, Cardiff. She put into practice innovative ideas on the education of children and was actively involved in the community.  Early life and education  Betty Campbell was born Rachel Elizabeth JohnsonElection results for the division of Butetown (2004) , Cardiff Council. Retrieved 12 November 2017. in Butetown, Cardiff, in 1934. The area was formerly known as Tiger Bay, which had built up around Cardiff docklands and was one of the UK's first multi-cultural communities. Her mother, Honora, known as Nora, was Welsh Barbadian. Her father, Simon Vickers Johnson, who had come to the UK from Jamaica when he was 15, was killed in World War Two when his ship the Ocean Vanguard was torpedoed in 1942. Her mother struggled financially after the death of Betty's father and occasionally worked as an illegal street bookmaker. At school, Betty was top of her class. She won a scholarship to the Lady Margaret High School for Girls in Cardiff and wanted to be a teacher from a young age. She faced discouragement from one of her teachers who told her the problems for a working-class black girl would be \\"insurmountable\\". This reduced her to tears, but it made her more determined to achieve her goals.  Career and life  Betty Johnson became pregnant at the age of 17, while she was doing her A-levels. She left school when she married Rupert Campbell, a fitter's mate, in 1953. Betty Campbell had four children, one of whom had special needs. She had 14 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. In 1960, when Campbell already had three children, she discovered that Cardiff Teacher Training College had started to enrol female students. Campbell applied, and was one of only six female students to be admitted. Mount Stuart Primary School, Butetown, Cardiff Campbell's first teaching post was in Llanrumney. She soon returned to Butetown, getting a job at Mount Stuart Primary School, where she taught for 28 years. As a black teacher she experienced hostility from some parents: \\"They hadn't seen a black teacher before. It was as if you could do a job, but if you’re black you weren’t quite as good.\\" School Buildings, Mount Stuart Primary School, Butetown, Cardiff Campbell was inspired by a trip to the US where she learned about anti-slavery activists like Harriet Tubman and the civil rights movement. When she became Wales' first black head teacher at Mount Stuart in the 1970s, she began teaching children about slavery, black history and the system of apartheid which operated at the time in South Africa. Speaking later in the Senedd, Campbell explained: \\"I was determined that I was going to become one of those people and enhance the black spirit, black culture as much as I could.\\" Campbell helped to create Black History Month and taught a series of workshops on the role of Butetown's citizens and their countries of origin in the Second World War. She served as an independent councillor for Butetown on Cardiff Council from 1999 to 2004.http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/Cardiff-1995-2012.pdf Prior to that, she had been a Butetown councillor on Cardiff City Council, from 1991 to 1995.  Influence and recognition  Under Campbell's leadership, Mount Stuart School raised its profile across the United Kingdom, and became a template for multicultural education. Campbell became a member of the Home Office's race advisory committee and a member of the Commission for Racial Equality. In 1994, Prince Charles attended the school's annual St David's Day eisteddfod. In 1998, as a member of the Commission for Racial Equality, she was invited to meet Nelson Mandela on his only visit to Wales. She was invited to be part of the Paul Hamlyn Foundation Commission on Education, which published a number of research papers on education. In 1993, it published the book \\"Learning to Succeed\\" where practice examples from Mount Stuart Primary School were cited. She was a board member of BBC Wales in the 1980s, and was made an honorary fellow of Cardiff Metropolitan University. In 2003, she was awarded an MBE for services to education and community life. In 2015 she received a lifetime achievement award from Unison Cymru's Black Members' group, for her contribution to black history and Welsh education.  Death and legacy  The BBC Wales Headquarters at One Central Square, Cardiff, where the statue of Campbell is to be located. Campbell died at the age of 82 on 13 October 2017, having been ill for several months. Hundreds of people lined the streets of Cardiff to pay their respects. On her death, First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones described Campbell as \\"a true pioneer\\" and an \\"inspiration to other black and ethnic minority people.\\" Race Council Cymru immediately called for a statue to be erected in her memory. In Cardiff, the only statue of a women who actually lived was that of Boudicca in the City Hall. This contrasted with the number of statues of famous men, including Aneurin Bevan, Ivor Novello and Lloyd George. In 2016, Helen Molyneux (the Chair of the Institute of Welsh Affairs), Carolyn Hitt, and the Welsh Women's Equality Network, organised 'Monumental Welsh Women', a task force to tackle this imbalance. In 2019, the BBC ran the 'Hidden Heroines' campaign to decide who should be the subject of Cardiff's first statue of a named woman, decided by a public vote. Five women were shortlisted: the poet and teacher Cranogwen (Sarah Jane Rees), the suffragette Lady Rhondda (Margaret Haig Thomas), the political organiser Elizabeth Andrews, the writer and anthropologist Elaine Morgan, and Betty Campbell. On 18 January 2019, it was announced that Campbell had won the vote, and that her statue would be erected outside the headquarters of BBC Wales in Central Square, close to Cardiff Central Station. The statue is intended to be an iconic landmark that people travel to Cardiff just to see. The sculptor Eve Shepherd was chosen from a shortlist of three artists. On seeing the design, Elaine Clarke, Campbell's daughter, commented that it encapsulated her mother \\"in a way that ensures her legacy of determination, aspiration and inspiration lives on for generations to come\\". The statue is being financed by private, corporate, crowd-sourced and Welsh Government funding and it is intended to be installed in 2020.

It was first brewed in 1664 in the Alsace region of France by master brewer Geronimus Hatt. It uses the exact same recipe as was first used in 1664. Kronenbourg 1664 is now produced in the UK by Heineken after being bought from Scottish & Newcastle. The French lager contains Strisselspalt hops, unique to the Alsace, which are used in its brewing process and give the beer its bitter and fragrant citrus taste, the recipe has never changed, Clement.  History  In 1649 Geronimus Hatt obtained his master brewer certificate. Fifteen years later in 1664 he then opened up his first brewery, Brasserie du Canon, in Strasbourg. Just under 200 years later the brewery relocated to the village of Cronenbourg, to the west of Strasbourg, because of a consistent flooding problem in its original location. Strisselspalt hops were used in the creation of the lager for the first time in 1885. This ingredient native to the Alsace region of France has been used in the creation of the beer ever since. In 1922, the Hatt Brewery changed its name to Tigre Brock. The name then changed again to Kronenbourg after the Second World War. By 1952 the beer now known as Kronenbourg 1664 was launched by Brasseries Kronenbourg to celebrate founder Geronimus Hatt. It was sold in France and imported to Britain in time for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. After its launch in Britain, it was exported to 68 other countries. In 2001 brewing company Scottish & Newcastle acquired Kronenbourg for £1.7 billion. During 2004–2005 Kronenbourg 1664 won an award at the International Brewing Awards for the first time. It finished first in Class 2: 4.6–6.9% ABV category. In 2008 Heineken purchased the licence to produce Kronenbourg 1664 in the UK from Scottish & Newcastle.  Production  Kronenbourg has breweries in the UK, France and Australia. Their UK brewery is based in Manchester and had a £50 million investment to improve its facilities and production. The Carlsberg Group officially owns and brews Kronenbourg globally, except in the UK where it is owned and brewed by Heineken International. Kronenbourg is available in the UK on draught and in several packed sizes including 275ml bottles, 660ml bottles, 568ml and 440ml cans  Advertising in the UK  In the 1980s Kronenbourg 1664 launched its 'A Different Kind of Strength' advertising campaign. The campaign was featured on television across the UK. It told the story of a young man who struggled to win a game of pool, however after training and drinking Kronenbourg 1664 he showed 'A Different Kind of Strength' in order to win. Kronenbourg 1664 began its 'Femme fatale' advertising campaign in 2000. The television ad showed men being distracted by what is at first assumed to be a young woman, however, after a few fatal accidents the camera zooms out and you find out they were all actually staring at a glass of Kronenbourg 1664. The ad created by advertising agency Rainey Kelly received over 60 complaints, all rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority (UK) In 2004 the 'Composer' advertising campaign was launched. The advert plays on the idea that once you open a bottle of Kronenbourg 1664 you have to stop what you're doing and enjoy it. Malcolm Venville directed the ad at Therapy Films. The 'Smaller Bubbles, Smoother Taste' Kronenbourg 1664 advert first aired in 2009 and was directed by Tony Kaye. The ad tells the story of a group of chefs trying to turn a large bubble into a number of smaller ones. They do this through the use of cooking equipment such as knives, mincers, graters and more. By the end, they have created the perfect sized bubbles to go in a glass of Kronenbourg 1664. October 2010 saw Kronenbourg 1664 team up with two different British bands to create adverts for its 'Slow the Pace' campaigns: the first was Motörhead who performed a slow acoustic version of their hit \\"Ace of Spades\\" in a busy pub. The second was Madness who played a toned down version of their song \\"Baggy Trousers\\". The slowed down version later featured on the Madness box set compilation A Guided Tour of Madness with the song title \\"Le Grand Pantalon\\". The two adverts created by ad agency BBH London encouraged the viewer to 'Slow the pace' and savour the taste. In March 2013, Kronenbourg 1664's 'A Taste Suprême' advertising campaign began and the slogan has become synonymous with the brand today. In the television advertisement, ex-professional footballer Eric Cantona played a starring role as brand ambassador. The ad plays on the idea that the hop farmers in France are treated like the celebrity footballers of the UK. The ad was created by advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather and featured the Queen song \\"We Are The Champions\\". In 2014 complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Authority which subsequently decided to ban the 2013 ad from being aired. Months later this ruling was overturned after Heineken submitted a request for the ruling to be reconsidered. 2016 saw the return of Cantona featuring in four videos for the digital campaign #lebigswim, the premise being that if 10,000 British people agreed that Kronenbourg 1664 is the best tasting beer in the world then Cantona would swim the English Channel. Cantona was also to appear again on television screens in association with Kronenbourg 1664. In 2016, the ex-Manchester United player featured in a television advert called 'The Alsace-tians'. The concept of the TV ad plays off common depictions of St Bernard dogs with barrels around their necks, however in this ad they used Alsatians who deliver Kronenbourg 1664 to the deserving.

Victor attended a Cossack military school and proved to be skilled at singing, and drawing under the guidance of General Nikolai Karpoff. After the October Revolution of 1917 when Bolsheviks came to power, the Ivanoff family was opposing the regime and fled to Yugoslavia in 1920 where Victor enrolled to study architecture at the University of Zagreb. His studies were abandoned and he joined General Platoff Don Cossack Choir on their tour which included visiting South Africa in 1936. Africa appealed to Ivanoff and he stayed on, first being employed as political cartoonist by Noticias, a Portuguese newspaper in Lourenço Marques, before finding work as a cartoonist at the Afrikaans newspaper in Johannesburg, Die Vaderland, a position he held for 37 years. Dr Willem van Heerden, editor of Die Vaderland, remembered that Ivanoff brought him with two cartoons and several drawings, one of which \\"showed Stalin as a monster on a heap of skulls, with vultures on the lookout in the sky. It was a picture of abhorrence, without the alleviating humour that later became such a distinctive feature of his cartoons…\\" Joel Mervis recounts that Ivanoff was recruited from Moçambique by the Rand Daily Mail, but because of his poor English was misdirected to Die Vaderland and was promptly snapped up.Penpricks - The Drawing of South Africa's Battlelines - Ken Vernon - The Spearhead Press, 2000 - One of Ivanoff's early commissions was a series of caricatures of members of parliament carried out under the guidance of Piet Grobler, Minister of Native Affairs and a member of J. C. Smuts' cabinet. His cartoons of Smuts had great impact, so much so that the United Party held Ivanoff partly responsible for their loss in 1948. He found himself at home with the Russian community in South Africa – his knowing a large number of Russian folk songs enhancing his popularity. He felt that Afrikaners and Russians had a great deal in common, such as a love of freedom and wide open spaces. During his career he created more than 12 000 cartoons, but his dream of being considered a serious artist saw him signing up for art lessons from Pierneef and a study trip to Europe. Working in oils and sepia tint, he produced mainly landscapes, people and animals, and took part in some joint exhibitions and ten solo exhibitions in the Transvaal. In 1945 Victor Ivanoff drew serial comic strips Kalie die Kuiken and Jors voer die Oorlog for the magazine Die Brandwag. His singing was of a high standard and saw his occasional appearance in local operatic productions. He was also a founder member of the South African Opera Association. His widow, Eveline, scattered his ashes in Russia's Don River.

In 1981 the third part was published in Zurich, again under the alias Rudolf Kefalín, however, Švandrlík vigorously rejected the authorship of this sequel. It is attributed to Miloš Miltner instead. Plot The novel pictures an ironic and satiric form of absurdity in the socialist army not long after the end of WWII. Without taking in consideration the cold war at the time and the fact that former Czechoslovakia was on the front line of potential armed conflict, Švandrlík focuses on day to day joys and sorrows of soldiers at Auxiliary Technical Unit (In Czech called Pomocný technický prapor) at which he allegedly served his time. The story takes place on Zelená Hora Castle in town of Nepomuk. Associated publications After the year 1990 Švandrlík wrote a number of books which followed on from Black Barons: * Říkali mu Terazky aneb šest půllitrů u Jelínků (\\"He was called Terazky and six pints at 'U Jelínka'\\") * Pět sekyr poručíka Hamáčka (\\"Five axes of Lieutenant Hamáček\\") * Lásky Černého barona (\\"The loves of the Black Baron\\") * Kam to kráčíš, Kefalíne?

Life Louise-Joséphine Sarazin de Belmont was born in Versailles in 1790. She studied painting under Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (1750–1819), who supplemented his income as an artist by teaching drawing to young women. In 1812 de Valenciennes was appointed a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts, which did not admit women. During the time of the First French Empire she was encouraged by Joséphine de Beauharnais. After the restoration of the monarchy she became a protegee of the Duchess of Berry. Sarazin de Belmont submitted her first paintings to the Salon in 1812. Her Salon entries in the years that followed show that she travelled widely. Between 1824 and 1826 she painted in Rome, Naples and Sicily, and in 1831 was in the Pyrenees. She received the second class medal at the Salon of 1831 In 1834 she depicted the Forest of Fontainebleau. She won a first class medal in 1834. An 1834 dictionary of French artists listed her as a landscape artist living on the Rue Saint-Germain-des-Prés (Boulevard Saint-Germain) in Paris, where she taught pupils drawing and painting at her studio. Sarazin de Belmont painted in Nantes and Brittany from 1836 to 1837. She lived in Italy from 1841 to 1865, painting landscapes around Rome and views of Florence, Naples and Orvieto. She won another medal at the Salon in 1861. Her 1861 submission to the Salon was two paintings of the Roman Forum, one in the morning and the other in the evening. In 1865 she returned to Paris, and submitted her last entries to the Salon of 1868 hors concours. She died in 1871.

She was the first woman to do her field work in North Korea and has international experience and recognition. Originally from Arizona in the United States, she has worked in countries including Chile, North Korea, China, Costa Rica, Antarctica, Italy, Japan and Ethiopia.  Early life  Iacovino was born and raised in Arizona. She entered Arizona State University in 2005, with the initial interest of filming and directing or becoming an astronaut but quickly became fascinated by geology. In her sophomore year, she began working for and researching with petrologist Gordon Moore. She then pursued her doctoral degree at the University of Cambridge.  Career  Iacovino's work has involved carefully negotiated diplomatic relations with countries such as North Korea. During one of these trips, she worked alongside a team of their scientists as the only woman involved. She was the first female scientist to ever conduct traveling research in North Korea and was also the only American on this expedition. Iacovino is part of a small group of women in volcanology, but is highly respected for her work ethic and strength. Iacovino's work in North Korea is part of an international effort (which includes American, British, North Korean, and Chinese colleagues) to understand Mount Paektu, an active volcano located on the border between North Korea and China. The work is led by British scientists Clive Oppenheimer (Iacovino's PhD supervisor) and James Hammond and was recently featured in the Werner Herzog documentary \\"Into the Inferno\\". The group's work has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Notably, the publications include both western and North Korean co- authors. In 2012, Iacovino also studied Erta Ale in Ethiopia. During this, her team was the target of a high-profile attempt to capture and imprison Westerners. Due to a delay in traveling, this was not successful - although several other tourists were harmed. Currently, Iacovino is working for NASA. Iacovino was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. Iacovino previously held a National Science Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the United States Department of the Interior US Geological Survey. She recreates magma chambers with experimental petrology, characterizes rock samples, measures volcanic degassing, and performs thermodynamic modeling. She has also published numerous articles in scientific journals, lectured at universities such as Arizona State University, and presented around the world. Additionally, she received many prestigious research grants, including the AAAS Research Grant most recently.  Personal life  Iacovino is the Editor- in-Chief of TrekMovie.com, as a longstanding Star Trek fan. She believes that science fiction is a useful tool in helping the public gain interest in science. She was also inspired by Kate Mulgrew's character - the first female captain of Star Trek. Mulgrew has since met with Iacovino and noted that unlike Iacovino, she \\"only played one [scientist] on TV.\\" Iacovino is involved in encouraging young women to pursue STEM careers, such as with projects like the Curiosity Science Program created through a Gold Award Project by one of BBC's 100 Women of 2016, Erin McKenney. In this program, Iacovino described her own career as one that requires curiosity, interest in the world, and a willingness to get your hands dirty.

Early life Born and raised with her brother Paul in the city of Adelaide, South Australia Anna Stewart completed her schooling at St Margaret’s Grammar School in Berwick, Victoria, Australia. On leaving school she worked as a journalist for the newspapers Nation Review, The Sun (The Sun News-Pictorial) and The Age in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia where she met her future husband, Jeremy Salt. In 1966, Anna left Australia for Beirut, Lebanon where she and Jeremy, who was already there, lived in the mountain village of Souk El Gharb. Later that year they moved to London, UK, where they both worked as journalists until their return to Australia two years later. Career In the early 1970s Anna Stewart moved from journalism into research and advocacy for the union movement. Anna successfully spearheaded the first Australian blue collar union campaign for maternity leave award provisions, in her capacity as Industrial Advocate for the Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australia. At the time she was in the late stages of pregnancy with her third child. In 1975 Anna Stewart moved to the Victorian branch of the Vehicle Builders' Employees' Federation of Australia where she fought for childcare facilities in car plants, researched and argued work value cases, initiated campaigns against sexual harassment, compelling employers to recognise sexual harassment as an industrial issue, and assisted with the Australian Council of Trade Unions Maternity Leave Test Case, regarded as a breakthrough in winning the right of working women to 52 weeks of unpaid maternity leave and the right to return to the same job.See following publication for full test case details and discussion Anna Stewart was a founding member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Women's Committee established in 1977 and worked tirelessly on programs to be incorporated into the Working Women's Charter. She emphasised the key demand made by the ACTU Working Women's Charter for the increased involvement of women within the structures of the union movement. As Senior Federal Industrial Officer with the Municipal Officers' Association, today merged with other unions, she initiated women's committees in most state branches of the union and developed strong policies in relation to women workers. Beyond her trade union commitments, Anna Stewart also stood as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party in the Legislative Assembly seat of Frankston, Victoria, for the 1979 Victorian state election where she won 42,8% of the vote and a +5.5 point swing in a traditionally conservative seat.Electoral results for the district of Frankston In 1980 she was international delegate to the annual meeting of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial OrganizationsAfl-cio organised at the White House in Washington, D.C. under the auspices of President Jimmy Carter. During this trip she also visited UAW picket lines. After her death in 1983 her landmark achievements in the struggle for the rights of working women were acknowledged in the launching of the Anna Stewart Memorial Project. The inaugural program was coordinated by the Municipal Officers' Association, Victoria, in April 1984, and was conceived as an annual two week \\"on the job\\" training program for women unionists. In 2014 the project celebrated its 30th anniversary. In 2001, Anna Stewart was posthumously inducted to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women.

Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 2016. In the late nineteenth century, the cult was buffeted by the political conflicts between conservatives who supported the Catholic Church and Guatemalan liberals, who were anticlerical, seeking to diminish the power of the Church. The Catholic hierarchy in Guatemala sought to increase its reach and to reinforce ideas that it symbolized a stance against leftists Juan José Arévalo and Jacobo Árbenz in the late 1940s and early 1950s who were considered socialists or communists. The color of the image was not highlighted during this era, but rather the focus was on the importance to Catholicism. However, \\"the color of the image would become its defining characteristic by the 1980s, when it became a site where the war-ravaged nation could seek peace and justice.\\"Celia Cussen, \\"Review of The Black Christ of Equipulas, American Historical Review, vol.121.

When she died at the age of 52, the Pakistan Press Foundation called it \\"end of a golden chapter of journalism in Pakistan.\\" Bhatti founded staff-owned Newsline magazine with the help of other female journalists after leaving Herald magazine. She was the editor of Pakistani magazine Herald for 12 years and then she founded Newsline and edited it for 8 years. In 1994, Bhatti received the “Courage in Journalism” award from the New York-based International Women's Media Foundation.  Early life  Razia Bhatti was born in 1944 at Karachi. She did her master's degree in English and Journalism from Karachi University and then decided to join professional journalism as her career.  Journalism  Razia Bhatti's professional career spanned thirty years. In 1967, she joined the Pakistani magazine The Illustrated Weekly of Pakistan, later renamed as The Herald and turned it into a monthly publication with focus on current and political issues. Bhatti became the assistant editor of Herald in 1970 and editor in 1976. The censorship imposed on press during General Zia-ul-Haq's martial law did not deter Bhatti and she continued reporting. \\"General Zia once got so infuriated that he waved a copy of her article at a press conference and said he would not tolerate such journalism,\\" recalls Beena Sarwar in her article, Razia Bhatti and Najma Babar: Two Champions of Independent Journalism in Pakistan. After she was pressurized to write in support of the policies of General Zia Ul-Haq's regime, Razia Bhatti resigned from the magazine. = Founding Newsline = After receiving pressure to curb her writing, most of her team of journalists resigned from The Herald along with her and together they established a new staff-owned current affairs monthly magazine called Newsline. Newsline was first published with Bhatti's editorial note in July 1989, that began: The Newsline magazine under Razia Bhatti's editorship covered a number of issues including drug cartels, ethnic and fascist political parties, militant Islamic groups, a president's son-in- law, a prime minister's spouse and successive governments during her career. She broke taboos and transgressed limits imposed on freedom of expression by authoritarian regimes as well as a conservative society. Throughout her career, Bhatti was driven to present unbiased, accurate and comprehensive reports on issues affecting the people of Pakistan. She was known to champion social causes, and campaigned against Government corruption. In December 1994, Newsline magazine published an article criticizing then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto for her inaction in the face of random killings, looting and high crime rate in the largest city of Pakistan, Karachi. Benazir Bhutto reacted to the criticism by banning Newsline magazine from the government-owned Pakistan International Airlines flights. Nothing intimidated Razia Bhatti and her staff at the magazine Newsline, and their reporting on the shortcomings of Benazir Bhutto government continued.  Personal life and legacy Razia Bhatti was married to Gul Hameed Bhatti and had two children - Kamil and Sara. Razia Bhatti reportedly died on 12 March 1996 at age 52. She suffered from high blood pressure and died of a brain hemorrhage at her home in Karachi, Pakistan. After her death, a noted Pakistani scholar and journalist Eqbal Ahmad wrote in his tribute to Razia Bhatti,\\"She will crash, I had thought then, or else she will help transform journalism in Pakistan. She did both.\\" See also Newsline (magazine)  References  Pakistani women journalists 1944 births 1996 deaths People from Karachi University of Karachi alumni Pakistani magazine editors Pakistani magazine founders ","title":"Razia Bhatti"},{"id":"52515086","text":"Beatrice Jedy-Agba is a Nigerian lawyer and anti-human trafficking advocate.

She works with Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) and is one of the legal representatives of the fourteen student activists from the New Democracy Movement (NDM). She has been the subject of harassment and threats from Thai authorities, as well as criminal charges related to her work as a human rights lawyer. She is the first Thai lawyer to have been charged with sedition by the military junta.  Education  Sirikan Charoensiri was born in Thailand in 1986 and was raised in Yasothon, Yasothon Province. She attended Triam Udom Suksa High School, obtaining a college preparatory education, and then entered law school, graduating from Thammasat University in 2009. After completing her degree, Charonsiri completed an internship with the International Commission of Jurists and then consulted with the Association for the Prevention of Torture and the American Bar Association on the prevention of torture, human rights concerns regarding the South Thailand insurgency and implementation of the Rule of Law Initiative for 2 years. In 2013, she enrolled in a master of laws program at the University of Essex to study international human rights law.  Career  Sirikan Charoensiri of Thailand with Melania Trump at the 2018 International Women of Courage Award Upon completion of her LL.M, Charonsiri returned to work for the International Commission of Jurists. When the 2014 Thai coup d'état occurred, she recognized the need to set up a separate entity to deal with legal matters, as attorneys were being barred access to their clients and the military was arresting people without a warrants, detaining them without charges, and detaining them in secret camps. When she co-founded Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, it was initially created as a counseling hotline. Soon it expanded to a team of human rights lawyers, funded by international advocacy groups to work on violations of human rights. In 2015, Charonsiri obtained the release of photojournalist Anthony Kwan Hok-chun, of the Initium Media organization from Hong Kong. Kwan, who had come to Thailand to report on the bombing of the Erawan Shrine, brought protective gear including a flak jacket and helmet, unaware that the items were controlled under Thai weapon's laws. He was arrested in attempting to return to Hong Kong and his passport was seized. That same year 14 pro- democracy student protesters were arrested in June 2015 and charged with sedition. Charoensiri and other lawyers representing the students, protested that the students were being tried in a military court. Seven months after the student's arrest, Charoensiri charged with refusal to comply with an official order and concealing evidence. The charges stemmed from her receiving her clients' cell phones when they were arrested and securing them in her car. The following day, she filed a complaint against the police for unlawfully confiscating her car to complete their search. The claim resulted in additional charges being filed against Charoensiri for false allegations against the police. After attending the 33rd general United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva, Charoensiri was issued a summons for additional charges of co-conspiracy and sedition. It was the first time that a lawyer had been charged with sedition by the junta, sparking outcry from international human rights organizations. On 19 May 2017 Sirikan Charoensiri achieved the fourth L4L-Award in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The award was given to her by Jorge Molano the lawyer from Colombia, who won the award in 2015. It was the first time a woman won this award.‘The Voice of Rights’, about lawyers and freedom of expression  References 1986 births Living people Thammasat University alumni Alumni of the University of Essex Women lawyers Thai lawyers Human rights lawyers Women human rights defenders Women who received the International Women of Courage Award ","title":"Sirikan Charoensiri"},{"id":"52515092","text":"The Basilica of Esquipulas.

It has the status of cathedral, minor basilica and Catholic sanctuary. History The statue of the Black Christ (El Cristo Negro) was commissioned by Spanish conquistadors and carved in 1594 by Quirio Cataño in Antigua and installed in the church in 1595. The history of the Basilica begins in 1735, when a priest named Father Pedro Pardo de Figueroa experienced a miraculous cure after praying before the statue. When he became Archbishop of Guatemala, he commissioned a basilica to shelter the statue. The church was completed in 1759. It is visited by about 4.5 million pilgrims annually, including 1.5 million in the days leading up to its patronal festival on 15 January and the festival on 9 March which marks the date of the image's arrival in the city in 1595. On a visit in 1840, the anthropologist John Lloyd Stephens described the church as the town's \\"only object of interest\\". The church was promoted to cathedral status by pope Pius XII in 1956 as the seat of the new Territorial Prelature of Santo Cristo de Esquípulas, whose first prelate Mariano Rossell y Arellano (the senior archbishop of Guatemala) sought to set up a Benedictine monastery attached to the cathedral to care for it - this was founded in 1959 by three monks sent from St. Joseph Benedictine Abbey in Louisiana. He also successfully petitioned pope John XXIII to promote the church to minor basilica status in 1961. It was visited on 6 February 1996 by Pope John Paul II during his second Apostolic Visit to Guatemala to mark the four-hundredth anniversary of the veneration of the Black Christ.

Bentley co-founded Children on the Edge with Dame Anita Roddick (founder of The Body Shop) in response to the Romanian orphanage crisis which occurred in 1990. She has since expanded the organisation to work in countries including East Timor, Burma, Bangladesh, and Bosnia. Bentley also does occasional consultancy work for agencies including UNICEF in the area of children's rights.  Early life  Bentley was born in Birmingham, England and spent much of her childhood in Fiji, where her father worked as an engineer for an international development agency. She attended an international school. Her family returned to Britain when she was eleven.  Education  Bentley has an MSc in Development Management and a Masters of Advanced Studies (MCR) in Children's rights. * 1989 LLB Hons Degree – Law (UK) * 1999 Post-graduate Diploma in Development Management (UK) * 2001 MSc Development Management (UK) * 2006 Masters Advanced Studies in Children's Rights – University of Fribourg and IUKB Sion, Switzerland  Children on the Edge  In 1990, after witnessing the appalling conditions in Romanian orphanages first hand, Dame Anita Roddick mobilised her company, The Body Shop International, to help these children. Initially, this involved volunteers like Bentley going to and helping three orphanages in the small village of Hălăucești in Iași County, Romania. Bentley was in the first convoy of volunteers to Romania. This experience marks the beginnings of Children on the Edge. By 1992 the team had developed considerable expertise in working with institutionalised children, establishing a programme to integrate them back into society. This prompted the organisation, upon invitation, to expand its work into Albania. By 1994 the work spread to Bosnia. It was clear that the organisation was working primarily with vulnerable children, in particular those without parental care. It was then that Rachel Bentley co- founded Children on the Edge. Since then, they have expanded their reach to include: * Burma. Helping children who have escaped ethnic cleansing and persecution in Burma as: migrants, refugees and IDPs (internally displaced people) living within Burma and on its borders. * Port-au-Prince. Enabling children in the post earthquake slums of Port-au-Prince to access sports coaching, mentoring and nutrition. * Bangladesh. Providing education for working children and Rohingya refugee children in Bangladesh. * India. Supporting education and child rights programmes for children from the dalit ‘untouchable’ caste in India. * Lebanon. In response to the Syrian refugee crisis we have also supported the building and running of refugee camp schools for over 300 children in Lebanon. * Uganda. After a successful pilot project in Soweto slum, Jinja, Uganda which provided safety, education and nutrition to 300 we are now beginning to replicate the success in four new communities and Congolese refugee settlements closer to the border. Children on the Edge was originally part of The Body Shop Foundation, but became an independently registered charity in 2004. The Body Shop Foundation continued to support the charity and to have some oversight on its use of funds, as of 2007. Its employees were supported in donating to Children on the Edge as of 2011.

She received a Gandhi Fellowship in 2010, a two-year leadership program. and 2013 Laureate Global Fellowship. While studying, she was involved with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) where she got a chance to closely work with eunuchs.  Kat-Katha  While working with the National AIDS Control Organisation, she visited Delhi's GB Road for the first time and got an opportunity to meet sex workers. She learned that these sex workers were made to serve 20-40 customers in a day, and that the women urgently needed a support system to talk about their personal lives and issues apart from gaining safe sex information. She refused high-profile job offers to set up Kat-Katha that aims to improve the lives of the sex workers in Delhi's infamous GB Road red light area. She helps them nurture their dreams, educate, and enrich their community. She encourages them to join mainstream life by helping them learn arts like stitching, embroidery, painting and motivates them to explore alternate life choices. Today, Kat-Katha serves 3,600-4,000 sex workers and teaches them a new way of life. Her organisation has 12 teachers from well-known colleges for its educational program and is taking care of 10-12 brothels. With the help of Kat-katha, 3 women are successfully working as tailors, along with 26 sex workers and 21 children who are being given quality education. In addition to the training, the center also provides safe zones for the women and their children. Kat-Katha also helps children of these women to spend their childhood out of the gloomy world.

A couple of years before his death from lung cancer he inspired the political regrouping that formed the Revolutionary Anarchist Organisation (\\"l'Organisation révolutionnaire anarchiste\\" / l'ORA). Life =Early years= Fayolle was born in Paris. During the early 1930s he became a frequent visitor to the library of the Co-operative Union at Amiens (founded by libertarian anarchists at the start of 1900). Here he became involved with the Amiens Union of Anarchists. He began to contribute to the anarchist newspaper \\"Le Libertaire\\" a regular column under the heading \\"Réflexe du passant\\". =After the war= War ended, formally, in May 1945 but the Paris region had already been liberated the previous summer. Fayolle settled in Versailles where he joined in the reconstruction of the Libertarian Movement which towards the end of 1945 became the Anarchist Federation. Between 1945 and 1952 he took on the secretaryship for internal relations, and then, in 1950, that for external relations. However, he was opposed to the de facto power seizure by Georges Fontenis and early in 1953 he was excluded from the Anarchist Federation. Fontenis take-over had been quickly followed by a name change to Communist Libertarian Federation. Fayolle then worked with Maurice Joyeux to create a new Anarchist Federation, and, starting in October 1954, a supporting newspaper, \\"Le Monde libertaire\\". A delegate at most of the federation's congresses, he was able to build a thesis of \\"organised worker anarchism\\". During the Algerian War of Independence, he repeatedly wrote in support of the anti-colonialist struggle, but also warned against the perils of a \\"nationalist revolution\\" leading to the emergence of a new hegemonistic bourgeoisie. =Revolutionary Anarchist Organisation= Identifying a stagnation in the anarchist movement which he attributed to its \\"aversion to organisation\\" (\\"inaptitude à l’organisation\\") he proposed the implementation of a more structured operation, applying the conven tion al economic and political precepts of the time. In 1956 he started calling for changes to the constitution of the Anarchist Federation, intended to \\"create an anarchist organisation with serious and dependable underpinnings, with a membership of men determined to move beyond sterile platitudes\\" (\\" créer une organisation anarchiste sur des bases sérieuses et solides, ne rassemblant que des hommes résolus à s’évader des paroles stériles\\"). In 1965 he published a collection of his texts articles in a book under the title \\"Réflexions sur l’anarchisme\\". He tried to convince Anarchist Federation militants in internal publications and presentations made to federation congresses. He failed. His advocacy of structural change encountered implacable opposition from numerous militant individualists who feared any more authoritarian approach, and for whom the superiority of minimalist organisational structures was an article of faith. In 1967 his concerns drove him to propound a new approach, and he advocated the Revolutionary Anarchist Organisation (\\"l'Organisation révolutionnaire anarchiste\\" / l'ORA). He went on to produce a new publication, \\"L'Organisation libertaire\\", of which the first edition was published at Marseilles in January 1968. The \\"events\\" of May 1968 gave a new impetus to the ORA which progressively separated itself out from the Anarchist Federation, most spectacularly at the International Anarchist Congress at Carrara in August/September 1968 where the ORA successfully backed his nomination to the international organisation's secretaryship. The next stepping stone to a split came at the Anarchist Federation congress in November 1968 when Fayolle and his supporters were accused of factionalism and stripped of their functions within the federation. In the end the ORA broke with the Anarchist Federation at the end of March 1970, uncompromisingly committed to a \\"platformist\\" structure. Maurice Fayolle was elected to the provisional national executive but by now he was gravely ill. He was taken to hospital at Versailles in May 1970 and died from lung cancer on 30 September 1970.

He was posted to Prague as secretary of the nunciature in 1927 along with Pietro Ciriaci to resolve the ongoing crisis in diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia and the Holy See occasioned by local celebrations of Jan Hus, viewed as a heretic by the Church and a national hero to many Czechs. The Nuncio to Czechoslovakia, Francesco Marmaggi, had withdrawn to Rome in protest. On 5 August 1935 he was named a titular archbishop and appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Czechoslovakia. He was consecrated a bishop by cardinal Eugenio Pacelli on 11 August 1935. His service was interrupted by World War II, when the German Nazi regime established a client state, the Slovak Republic, which was recognized by several countries, including the Holy See, which maintained a diplomatic office headed by a chargé d’affaires, Giuseppe Burzio. On 11 May 1946 Ritter was named Internuncio to Czechoslovakia, but illness allowed him to perform his duties only intermittently. Nevertheless, because of his support for the Czechoslovakian bishops against the new regime, the government declared him undesirable in March 1949 and he left Prague in July.

Location Johnstown Castle is located on the Johnstown Castle Estate, a estate, located off the road between Murntown and Rathaspeck, southwest of Wexford town. History The castle c. 1860–83 with garden and Victorian gentleman (presumably one of the Grogan-Morgans) in the foreground. The first castle built on the estate was a tower house built in the late 12th century by the Esmonde family, Normans who came to southeast Ireland from Lincolnshire in the 1170s after the Norman invasion of Ireland (1169). They also built a tower house, which still stands, at Rathlannan immediately to the south. Oliver Cromwell spent a night on the estate in 1649, prior to the October 1649 Sack of Wexford. His Roundhead army used the land around Johnstown Castle to prepare. The Esmondes, Catholics, were expelled during the Cromwellian years. Johnstown Castle was bought by the Grogan family in 1692. Owner Cornelius Grogan was hanged for his part in the 1798 Rebellion; he had been commissary-general for the United Irishmen. In 1810 the estate was restored to his brother John Knox Grogan, who, with his son, Hamilton Knox Grogan-Morgan, created Johnstown Castle as it stands today, on the \\"bones\\" of the Norman tower house. Daniel Robertson designed the Gothic Revival castle and parts of the surrounding land. By 1863, the demesne was divided in two, with a deer park in the north and the castle, pleasure grounds, farm and two artificial lakes to the south. By 1836–1872 the building was finished. The Grogans later married into the ancient FitzGerald family. During the First World War, Royal Naval Air Service airships were based at Johnstown Castle, and were primarily used to deal with the U-boat threat, but with limited success.Furlong, Nicholas and John Hayes.

In 1945, Maurice Victor Lakin gave the estate to the Irish state in lieu of taxes. It was taken over by Teagasc and used for agricultural research, while the castle was used for offices and laboratories before opening to the public in 2019. Peter Pearson of the Irish Heritage Trust worked on conserving and restoring the building. In 2007, a temporary opera house was erected in the castle, to host the Wexford Festival Opera.

Hlouch first served as a parish priest and professor in Olomouc and other places before he was appointed to the episcopate following a standoff between ecclesial authorities and the Nazis as to whom would assume the Budweis episcopal see. He was installed in his new diocese at a time when communist authorities solidified their control over the then-Czechoslovakia which prompted Hlouch and other ecclesial leaders such as Josef Beran to speak out against communist repression. Hlouch was placed under house arrest and later exiled from his diocese but the Prague Spring allowed for him to return in 1968. The late bishop became known for his holiness and for his leadership of his old diocese and in 2015 the Czech Episcopal Conference lodged a formal request to Rome to open the beatification process. The process opened on 7 November 2017 and he became titled as a Servant of God. Life Josef Hlouch was born in Lipník in the Třebíč District on 26 March 1902 to Jakub Hlouch and Marie Hlouchová. In 1935 he obtained his doctorate in theological studies in Olomouc after having obtained his habilitation in 1934. He received his ordination to the priesthood in mid-1926 in Olomouc from Archbishop Leopold Prečan. From 1945 until his episcopal appointment he served as a professor to seminarians after having served as a pastor since 1939 just before World War II began. In September 1928 he began serving as the parish administrator for the Hodolana parish in Olomouc. Hlouch was later appointed as a bishop and received his episcopal consecration from Saverio Ritter in Olomouc with Josef Beran and Stanislav Zela serving as the co-consecrators. His solemn enthronement in his episcopal see came as a relief to the faithful since the see had been vacant since 1940. The Nazis had opposed a particular prelate nominated for the position leading to Pope Pius XII leaving the see vacant; the Nazis defeat in 1945 allowed for Hlouch to be appointed as a bishop. His constant criticisms and opposition to the communist regime in the then- Czechoslovakia prompted his exile from the diocese. This was exacerbated when the authorities began monitoring all his activities after a 19 June 1949 sermon where he criticized the nation's direction under the regime. He returned to his diocese on 9 June 1968 on the occasion of the Prague Spring. Hlouch had even been placed under house arrest in 1950 and in 1952 was arrested and then exiled from his diocese without a court trial. He left for several cities during this time first in Liberec and then in Mladá Vožice. In 1963 the facilitated negotiations between Pope John XXIII and the Czech Socialist Republic allowed for imprisoned bishops to be released. This prompted Hlouch's release in April 1963. In 1968 he sent a letter to Miloslav Vlk in which he asked the then-deacon to become his personal aide. This was much to Vlk's surprise who had hoped to go abroad for further studies. Prior to Vlk's ordination he met with Hlouch in the bishopric for breakfast one morning where he spoke to the prelate about his plans for his future studies. Hlouch met with Vlk again one morning in the bishopric for breakfast two weeks later in which the latter assented to the role. Hlouch later ordained Vlk as a priest on 23 June 1968. Hlouch died on 10 June 1972. His reputation for holiness had been noted in his life as well as for his gentle smile combined with his thoughtful nature. The communists did not allow for Pope Paul VI to name a successor which rendered the see vacant until Pope John Paul II appointed Miloslav Vlk as Hlouch's successor. Beatification process From 2012 the late bishop's friend and aide Miloslav Vlk - now a cardinal - said that a beatification process could be launched because the potential for a formal application to Rome was something being evaluated. The Czech Episcopal Conference in autumn 2015 made a formal application to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to launch the cause with the C.C.S. issuing the \\"nihil obstat\\" decree on 7 November 2017 in a move that titled Hlouch as a Servant of God. The diocesan process to collect documentation and witness testimonies is expected to be launched sometime in 2018.

She and her sister created an important record of life in the early twentieth century. Life Augusta was born in Paramaribo in 1873. She took her mother's surname as her father abandoned them. Together with her sister Anna they were known as the ladies Curiel or the Curiel sisters. Augusta took pictures and Anna acted as her assistant. In 1929 Queen Wilhelmina granted her the title of hofleverancier. She was the first photographer of Suriname for the royal house. The sisters Curiel were the owner of one of the most famous photo studios in Suriname: Augusta Curiel. For almost forty years the sisters Curiel sisters took pictures of everyday life in Suriname. The photographs show that Augusta Curiel was a compositional and a technically gifted photographer. She always worked with available light and no photometer. Despite these limitations, they proved able to create beautiful images in dim government buildings, churches and factories. Curiel's oeuvre is made up of mostly daily life topics, which were of value to historians and other interested parties. They photographed both in their studio and on plantations and in the interior. The botanist Gerold Stahel took the women on some of his expeditions. Many of the surviving images are group portraits, made by and for (mission) schools, boarding schools and orphanages. They used a heavy wood and plate camera. After the shooting, the negatives were developed and printed by illuminating off the glass from below. A few times a week, a batch of ice was delivered to the dark room, the required chemical baths to keep the proper temperature. Probably Anna and Augusta reused a lot of the expensive glass negatives. Fortunately, many cityscapes, landscapes, shots of factories, schools and orphanages have survived. Anna tried to continue the photo studio after the death of Augusta, but she sold the shop in the 1950s. The glass plates were expensive and may have been reused several times to take different pictures. In 2005 Janneke van Dijk, curator of the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, found out that about 400 original glass plate negatives were stored in the depot of the Surinaams Museum in Fort Zeelandia. Despite the time and the climate the pictures were in good condition. They were digitised and published in 2007 as \\"Augusta Curiel, Photographer in Suriname from 1904 to 1937\\".

The protest began in the aftermath of the shooting by police of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. The image, taken by Jonathan Bachman for Reuters, became a viral phenomenon on social media, described by several media organizations as \\"iconic\\", with some comparing the image (and Evans) to the photograph of \\"Tank Man\\" in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.  Background  At the protest on July 9, 2016, which followed the shooting of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and of Philando Castile in Minnesota by police officers, Ieshia Evans was photographed by Jonathan Bachman for Reuters news agency confronting a line of police in riot gear. The image shows a young woman in a flowing dress standing with her arms crossed facing down a line of heavily armed police while two armored officers rush forward to put her in handcuffs. The photograph became a viral phenomenon on social media. Evans was attending her first protest when she was arrested, having traveled to Baton Rouge after seeing news coverage of the shooting of Sterling. She was detained, held overnight and released on the evening of the next day.  Cultural impact  Multiple media organizations described the image as \\"iconic\\". The German television channel n-tv described Evans as the \\"icon\\" of the protest. Teju Cole, writing for the New York Times Magazine, said that \\"in spite of, or because of, its simple narrative, Bachman's photograph became an icon. It joined a small group of other images connected to the Black Lives Matter movement\\", including images of a man throwing a tear gas canister back at police during a protest in Ferguson, Missouri after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, Bree Newsome taking down a Confederate flag at the South Carolina State House, and activist DeRay Mckesson being arrested in Baton Rouge, also while protesting Sterling's death. The photograph drew comparisons to images of previous civil rights demonstrations as well as the image of \\"Tank Man\\" taken during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Yoni Appelbaum commented for The Atlantic: Evans was interviewed by Gayle King for CBS This Morning, and the public radio program Studio 360 later commissioned Tracy K. Smith to write a poem on the subject of the image. The photograph was included in The New York Times \\"The Year in Pictures 2016\\".  Awards  Bachman's photograph of Evans standing as the two police officers charge towards her was awarded first prize for Contemporary Issues in the 2017 (60th) World Press Photo Contest.  Ieshia Evans  Evans, the subject of the photograph, was 35 at the time it was taken. She is originally from Brooklyn and is a licensed practical nurse in Pennsylvania. In December 2016, Evans met Bachman for the first time at a symposium on news photography organized by Reuters and the International Center of Photography. Evans was named AfroAmerica Network Black Woman of the Year for 2016 and was chosen to one of the BBC's 100 Women for that year. After the protest Evans was critical of the 2016 election candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, as well as former President Barack Obama. She has been a vocal critic of the Trump Administration and has stated that she would like to see more whistle-blowing due to skepticism surrounding the issues of social justice.

Jane Anne Plant CBE, FREng, FRSE, FRSA was a leading geochemist, scientist, and author. Plant was a pioneer in the field of geochemical surveys and environmental surveys. She was Chief Scientist at the British Geological Survey and was a Professor of Geochemistry at Imperial College London. Plant was also highly involved in the Institution of Mining & Metallurgy (now Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining) where she was involved in many aspects including a role on the Council, and was the first female President of the Institution of Mining & Metallurgy, a post she held from 2001 to 2002. This gave her an extensive network of key connections with government, industry and academia. Plant was diagnosed with cancer several times and studied the link between diet and breast cancer. She published several books on the subject. Plant was appointed a CBE in 1997 in recognition of her contribution to Earth science and industry. She was a British Geological Survey scientist until her retirement from the role of Chief Scientist in 2005. Plant was Emeritus Professor of Geochemistry at Imperial College until her death on 4 March 2016.  Early Life  Plant was born in Woodville, Derbyshire, the only child of Ralph and Marjorie (née Langton) Lunn who were village shopkeepers. She attended at Ashby de la Zouche Grammar School from where she went to Liverpool University in 1963. She graduated with first class honours in geology and took the prize for the best degree in her year. Career Plant spent most of her career at the British Geological Survey (BGS), and is credited for establishing the ‘Environment and Health’ as significant research. She joined the Institute for Geological Sciences (former name of BGS) in 1967, at the age of 23. There, she led the geochemical reconnaissance programme mapping the presence of elements in Scottish Highlands. She was the first woman to be appointed to a Scientific Officer role rather than in a technical or supporting grade. She was assigned to the Atomic Energy Section in London, led by Stanley Bowie. She developed methods for a regional geochemical survey in the north of Scotland and was awarded a PhD in 1977 from the University of Leicester for her thesis \\"Regional Geochemical mapping in Great Britain with particular reference to sources of error\\". Plant developed the high-resolution BGS Geochemical Baseline of the Environment (G-BASE) programme to map different chemicals over the land surface by analyzing sediments, ore deposits, soils and water samples. The programme began to broaden and created a geochemical database, which could be applied to economic, health and environmental issues. She applied her maps to health and her findings helped create the field of environmental health, specifically researching Asian and Africa, and was able to study a correlation between a lack of available selenium and heart disease in China. Her personal influence on the research community was great. After getting her PhD in 1977, she received a special merit promotion in 1983. Along with numerous awards, she was also a member of Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (1999-2005). Her achievements were recognized by her peers with many awards. Her research in the environmental geochemical field became more personal in 1993 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer for the sixth time. She noticed the low cancer rate among Chinese women and discovered a correlation between cancer rate and dairy consumption. Her research led to many of the protocols used in today's geochemical mapping projects worldwide. Plant's methods have also been adapted and adopted around the world as a standard for geochemical surveys.  Discoveries  Along with writing books, Plant took part and co-wrote many scientific reports and papers. One examined the geological problems from the geochemical maps based on sediment samples and found that in the Northern Highlands, the regional variations are related to the position of the basement slices. These are attributed to the lateral variations in sediment composition. Plant found that there are three belts of alpine type ultramafic rocks in the Scottish Highlands. Each of these rocks are associated with a change of sedimentation and structural style. A more recent article, looked at the relationship between synthetic chemicals and increased pollution in the environment and the impact on both humans and the Earth's ecosystems. An emphasis is placed on the risk perception of radioactivity in society, which is found to be quite dangerous.

She is the only woman said to have been bestowed the Mau Mau rank of field-marshal. She was one of the very few women to become active fighters in the liberation movement.  Early life  Muthoni wa Kirima was born in 1931 in Kenya's central region. Muthoni’s journey as a revolutionary started when she was a girl, saving money to have Jomo Kenyatta travel abroad to bring freedom. Although her parents worked on a European farm, after her marriage to Gen Mutungi, she moved to a village reserve for Africans in Nyeri before joining the Mau Mau. In her 20s, she first worked as a spy for Mau Mau fighters who had camped in the forest when war broke out in 1952. She was one of the very few women to become active fighters in the liberation movement. Most other women only worked as carriers of information or supplies. During the war, Muthoni was wounded on two occasions but never caught. While living in the forest, she suffered a bad miscarriage that left her unable to conceive. She moved out of the forest after Kenya gained independence from Britain in 1963. “Kenya is my only child,” she told the Daily Nation in an interview in 2012, a loaded statement bearing in mind that her marriage did not bear her any children.  Trading in ivory  Field Marshal Muthoni got a licence to trade in ivory in 1966, saying she used to kill elephants for food and hide the ivory, and knew where they had buried tusks during their life in the forest. Her permission to collect and sell “wild” ivory ended in 1976 when trade in ivory was banned.  Later life  In 1990, she served as a nominated councilor in Nyeri County Council, central Kenya. In 1998, President Daniel arap Moi awarded her a medal for distinguished service, and in 2014, President Uhuru Kenyatta awarded her the Head of State Commendation. Currently, Muthoni wa Kirima lives in a Nyeri suburb.

[Milford Charles] Boys. She grew up in the midst of the pre-Vatican II Catholic church. Living in Seattle she was immersed in conversations with friends across multiple faith traditions. The Second Vatican Council opened up new possibilities for leadership and action within the church, and Boys has noted that the Vatican II document Nostra Aetate, published in 1965, provided a crucial catalyst for her formation and imagination. In August 1965 Boys joined a Roman Catholic women’s religious order, the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. In 1969 Boys completed a BA in Religion and Humanities at Fort Wright College of the Holy Names in Spokane, WA and began her teaching career as an instructor in Religion and in English at the Holy Names Academy in Spokane, WA. She made her final vows to the community in 1972. Building on her vocation as an educator Boys moved to New York City to undertake the joint M.A. in Religion and Education at Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary, a degree she completed in 1975. Following that degree she entered their EdD program, and in 1978 she successfully defended her dissertation: \\"“Heilsgeschichte” as a hermeneutical principle in religious education,\\" which was done under the mentorship of the late biblical scholar Raymond E. Brown and philosopher of education Dwayne Huebner. From 1977 to 1994 she was on the faculty of Boston College, moving fluidly through the process from instructor to full professor. While there she wrote voluminously, garnering a reputation as the key Catholic scholar in the field of religious education who was engaging issues of Jewish/Christian understanding. In 1994 she returned to her alma mater, Union Theological Seminary, as the Skinner and McAlpin Professor of Practical Theology, and in July of 2013 she was installed as Dean of Academic Affairs at Union. She continues to hold both of these positions. Significant Contributions to Religious Education Boys began her research in the field of religious education by engaging historical critical biblical scholarship, which was only then beginning to have an impact in the Catholic context due to Vatican II. Her first book, Biblical Interpretation in Religious Education, was published by the Religious Education Press in 1980. In addition to numerous articles, chapters, and public lectures she became deeply involved with the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education. That association led to her ground-breaking scholarly collaboration with Dr. Sara Lee in Christian-Jewish learning and dialogue. Boys has made significant contributions to the field of religious education through her work on “learning in the presence of the other.” She has fundamentally reshaped not only Christian-Jewish dialogue, but also the scholarship of learning in multi- faith contexts across myriad traditions. The recipient of many large grants, she has been a senior advisor to several national projects, including the Valparaiso Project in the Education and Formation of Faith, the Catholic- Jewish Colloquium, Educating for Religious Particularism and Pluralism, and the ATS Project on Christian Hospitality and Interreligious Education. =Awards= Boys received the International Council of Christians and Jews Sir Sigmund Sternberg Award in 2005, the Eternal Light Award from the Center for Catholic-Jewish Studies at St. Leo University in 2012, the Ann O’Hara Graff award from the CTSA Women’s Consultation on Constructive Theology in 2013, and the Shevet Achim Award in 2014 from the Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations.

Her work is concerned with identity and preserving cultural heritage. Through investigating Islamic art history she reinterprets contemporary Arab politics, feminist discourse and social issues. Through her culturally oriented work, she is concerned with using history as a means to better understand the present and find solutions for the future. Bahia is interested in the ways in which art may be employed for the purposes of social change and has explored this phenomenon through her artwork, which draws upon such socially charged themes as Arab identity and women's rights. Her research is largely concerned with understanding the Arabic letter and has been preoccupied with Arabic calligraphy in much of her work. By imbuing traditional Arabic and Islamic scripts with political messages in her artwork, she has managed to portray how art can be used to understand societal situations and convey them to a larger audience. Bahia claimed an active role in the Egyptian revolution that swept across Egypt in 2011 by spraying her artwork upon the walls in Cairo. Her work has been displayed in exhibitions around the world and she has received several awards for her achievements. In 2019, Shehab was a main feature in the Polaris catalogue produced by Visual Collaborative, she was interviewed alongside other practitioners from around the world.  Early life and education  Shehab was born in 1977 in Lebanon, and grew up there. She studied graphic design in Beirut, and studied for a master's degree in Cairo. Educational Work and Research Academia: The Graphic Design Program at the AUC In 2011, Bahia established the Graphic Design program at the Department of the Arts in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the AUC. The major's design curriculum revolves around the visual culture of the Arab world and students are encouraged to present a keen awareness of Arab visual culture as they work on various design projects. Bahia encourages her students to make use of their interests while developing their work and emphasizes the need to use design to solve problems. In 2015, the first graduating graphic design class presented their graduation projects in the Sharjah Art Gallery at the AUC. Their projects were concerned with rebranding public institutions, human rights, social issues, cultural heritage, political reflections and personal expression. Students employed all forms of design in their projects to communicate their messages in their relevant medium. Since then, the number of students studying in the Graphic Design program has dramatically increased. AUC Graduating Graphic Design Students displaying their work in the exhibition “Zoom in Keda!\\", Sharjah Art Gallery, AUC, 2018, photo by Mostafa Abdel-Aty Bahia has taught over fifteen courses on graphic design, including theoretical courses on the history of Arab graphic design, history of Arabic calligraphy and history of advertising in the Arab world. Her courses also include practical ones on Arabic typography, introduction to design, logo and corporate identity, packaging, retail design, illustration and advertising and branding. She has also served as senior thesis advisor for graduating classes. She has been teaching at AUC since Fall of 2010. Edraak Courses Bahia's educational achievements have not only been limited to university coursework. She has also participated in developing MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) for Queen Rania Foundations’ educational platform Edraak where over 50,000 students have registered to date. In Fall 2015 and Spring 2017, the course “Introduction to Graphic Design,” was offered to Edraak students. Another one of her courses, “Introduction to Arabic Type Design,” is yet to be offered in 2019. Conferences and Symposiums Bahia has given many public lectures in over 26 cities, on her art practice at different conferences, symposiums universities, institutions and museums around the world. She has widely spoken about her “A Thousand Times No” project and about her contributions to the art scene in the context of the Egyptian revolution of 2011, including spray painting political messages on the walls of the streets of Cairo. She frequently lectures internationally on Arab visual culture and design, design education and curriculum development, women's’ rights, social issues, Islamic cultural heritage and her art practice. Jury and Board Work Bahia served as a jury member for a number of competitions. In September 2014, she was a jury member of the Poster for Tomorrow competition where she was responsible for choosing the winners of a poster competition whose theme revolved around the rights to fair and equal employment along with other jury members from around the world. The title of the competition was “Work Right!”.http://www.posterfortomorrow.org/en/projects/work-right- competition/online-jury She became a jury member again for the same competition in September 2016, when the competition was titled “Make Extremism History” and the theme was concerned with addressing extremism.http://www.posterfortomorrow.org/en/projects/community-for- tomorrow/online-jury In October 2017, she judged the competition again when the theme was “Freedom of Movement.http://www.posterfortomorrow.org/en/projects/freedom-of- movement/livejury In March 2016, the 100 Best Arabic Posters initiative, which was launched from the German University in Cairo in Egypt, gave designers in the Arab world the chance to submit their posters for judging and inclusion in a publication by a jury of which Bahia was a member. In November 2016, Bahia was selected to be a member of the jury of the Mahmoud Kahil Award program, which is based in Beirut, Lebanon and is dedicated to promoting comics, editorial cartoons and illustrations in the Arab world by recognizing and rewarding the work of illustrators in this part of the world. In honour of her achievement as a laureate of the Prince Claus Award, the Embassy of the Netherlands in Egypt announced a Wasla competition in September 2017 in collaboration with the Prince Claus Fund where the theme was concerned with making connections and building bridges. Egyptian designers were given the chance to submit poster designs in light of this theme and Bahia participated in choosing and announcing the winners. While this project was a form of historical visual research, during the January 25 Revolution in 2011 in Egypt, Bahia somehow “freed” these one thousand no's from their historical associations and gave them new meanings through the political events of the revolution. She used the different styles of the “no” to protest against current events that she found unfavourable. Some examples include, “no to burning books”, “no to a new pharaoh”, “no to stripping the people” and “no to killing men of religion”.Bahia Shehab (1977, Egypt/Lebanon), Prince Claus FundationReport from the 2016 Prince Claus Awards Committee May 2016 Art =A Thousand Times NO” and Political Graffiti= In 2010, the Khatt Foundation in Amsterdam invited Bahia to produce an artwork for the exhibition “The Future of Tradition”, whose purpose it was to commemorate 100 years of Islamic Art in Europe after the exhibition “Masterpieces of Muhammadan Art” at the Haus der Kunst in Munich, Germany. Her project “A Thousand Times NO” was an art installation and research project that went on display in a room curated by Huda Smitshuijzen Abifares, the founder of Khatt Foundation, with other female artists from the Arab world celebrating the Arabic script. The main message that Bahia sought to convey through her artwork was the simple “NO”. In accordance with the Arabic saying, “No and a thousand times no,” Bahia sought out one thousand different Arabic no's. She found them on buildings, mosques, plates, textiles, pottery and books from countries, such as Spain, China, Afghanistan and Iran, where Islam had thrived at one point in history or another. These one thousand no's were displayed altogether in the form of a plexiglass curtain at the Haus Der Kunst exhibition. Next to this installation was a book, which was published by the Khatt Foundation, where Bahia gathered all one thousand no's in chronological order together with the names of the places where she came by them, the media that were used to write the no's and the patrons who were responsible for commissioning the works upon which the no's were found. =Landscape/Soundscape: 20 Minarets from the Arab World= Another project that Bahia created, “20 Minarets from the Arab World,” is a significant cultural project that was displayed at the Arab Contemporary Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark. In this project, Bahia takes the minaret, an important element of the architectural landscape in the Arab world, as the starting point. Here, she displays 20 minarets from the Arab world while taking into consideration their proportions and begins with the smallest minaret from Mogadishu and ends with the tallest one from Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. She also includes the minaret of the Great Mosque of Aleppo in Syria but it appears to be in ruins to represent the cultural disaster that struck in 2013 when the minaret was bombed. In this project, Bahia was concerned with how the Arab cultural heritage was being physically destroyed on one hand and, on the other hand, she how it was being intellectually attacked by Western nations and labelled as backwards and terroristic. As part of the installation, Bahia also included the adhan (call to prayer) in the voice of a woman. Her choice was inspired by the idea that women should raise their voices and God. =Global Street Interventions Campaign= Since 2016, Bahia has been working on a global street interventions campaign that involves spray painting quotes from the Palestinian poet and author Mahmoud Darwish on the walls of streets around the world. She believes that Darwish's words are relevant given the political situation in which we find ourselves today. The quotes include, “Stand at the corner of a dream and fight” and “I had a dream that will be and a butterfly cocooned in prisons,” in honour of Mahinoor Elmasry who was arrested along with countless others for standing against injustice in Egypt. Other quotes include, “No to the impossible,” “We love life if we had access to it,” “I will dream,” “How big is the idea, how small is the state,” “Those who have no land have no sea,” “On this earth there are things worth living for,” “One day we will be who we want to be, the journey has not started and the road has not ended,” and “My people will return as air and light and water.” The style with which these quotes are painted is largely abstract and geometric and such simple shapes as circles, rectangles and triangles are employed in the artworks. Her street art has also been inspired by older Arabic scripts. Thus far, she has painted walls in Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, Lebanon, the United States of America, Morocco and Norway.Bahia Shehab (eg) Nuart Festival 2017 =The Chronicles of Flowers= In 2017, Bahia opened an exhibition in Istanbul, Turkey called “The Chronicles of Flowers” which revolves around a personal documentation of Bahia's significant relationship with flowers. When Bahia broke her left knee in 2011, her mother came to Cairo from Beirut to look after her and she would create a flower arrangement from the garden and place it next to Bahia's bed. This led to Bahia's interest in documenting flowers for years to come. More than that, for Bahia, these flowers have significant likenesses to the women in her life as they have given her the chance to better understand herself and her society. The exhibition involved plexiglass screens, video and audio projections and flower scents allowing the audience to enjoy a multi-sensory experience. A book, whose narrative begins from Lebanon's Civil War in the 1980s and ends in 2017 after the revolution in Egypt, also contains a documentation of 77 flowers along with their significance to Bahia. The exhibition ran from May 9 to June 17 in 2017. The Chronicles of Flowers =Project Light= Project Light is a global art campaign that was launched by Peek Vision and Fine Acts. The aim of the project is to raise awareness and increase public engagement for everyone's right to see and have good vision. In Phase 1 of the project, the goal is to allow a number of artists, of which Bahia is one, to create contemporary art pieces based on the concept of the right to sight. The campaign seeks to encourage policymakers to make decisions that will allow people better access to eye care. =The Reflections of Shangri La= Between August 9 and August 22 of 2018, Bahia completed an artist residency at the Shangri La Museum for Islamic Art, Design & Culture in Honolulu, Hawaii. During this period, she studied Doris Duke's collection of Islamic art and used her findings as part of an exhibition, “Reflections on Shangri La,” that opened on September 27 in the Arts of Islam Gallery at the Honolulu Museum of Art. While studying the artwork in Shangri La's collection, she noticed that many women had been depicted as illustrations however, the illustrations were miniature. As such, for the exhibition, she decided to make these women the center of the works by increasing the sizes of the illustrations drastically. Her aim is to give visitors the chance to better see how these women from different dynasties lived and looked. A second part of her residency involved the creation of a two-part mural onsite at the Shangri La Museum of Islamic Art, Culture & Design. Based on a poem from the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, the stanza - depicted in an artists-created font of foliated and pixellated Kufic, with roots instead of vegetation - is a site-specific commentary on colonized land. Recognition and Awards * 2012, she became a TED fellow and gave a TED talk about her project “A Thousand Times No” * 2016, she became a senior TED fellow. She also made the BBC's 100 Women list * 2013, and was given the chance to meet and discuss important issues with BBC's other 99 women. * 2015, Bahia was featured in the documentary film “Nefertiti’s Daughters,” which recounts the important role that street artists played during the Egyptian revolution with a special focus on what women did during that period and how they participated in the struggle to attain women's rights. The film's director was concerned with particular women artist's perspectives on the events that were taking place in Egypt. * 2016, Bahia's work on the development of the Arabic script has culminated in her becoming a laureate of the Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands. Her successful integration of the historical Arabic script with current political events and bringing this historical research out into the streets in the form of street art using her “A Thousand Times No” project has allowed for a breakthrough in the knowledge of the uses of the Arabic script. * 2016, Bahia was shortlisted for the Jameel Prize 4 award from the Victoria and Albert Museum, London for her work on the “A Thousand Times No” project. * 2017, she became the first Arab woman to receive the UNESCO-Sharjah Prize for Arab Culture for her use of historical Arabic calligraphic scripts in the streets in a modern political context. She received this prize alongside another Arab calligraffiti artist, eL Seed. * 2017, in October Bahia was invited to speak at the Obama Foundation Summit where she was given the chance to meet with other leaders and share her experiences as an artist working and achieving in the Arab world. Philosophy In her artwork, Bahia has always incorporated politically charged themes. Her work is concerned with issues of current political interest, such as the civil war in Lebanon from the 1980s, the revolution that swept through Egypt in 2011 and political prisoners. An important element of her artwork is her concern for women and while this takes on a largely political scope in the sense that the concern is often with women's rights, as a woman, Bahia also finds herself concerned with the humanity of women and, through her artwork, she encourages other people to relate to these women's lives however ordinary they may seem in some cases. Her concern for the Arab heritage has led her to pay attention to the Arab woman and the current issues that allow the attainment of women's rights a significant issue. Although led by significant research efforts, many of which are academic, Bahia is able to employ much of her artwork in such a way as to be able to relate to a contemporary audience that is composed of the ordinary.

Personal life and career Catrambone was born in Reggio Calabria, Italy, and was living there when she met her future husband, the American entrepreneur Christopher Catrambone, in 2006. The two were married in 2010, and live in Malta with their teenage daughter, Maria Luisa. Catrambone and her husband worked together to build the insurance firm Tangiers Group, which specialises in insuring people working in conflict areas. Migrant aid work While on a yacht cruise near Lampedusa in July 2013, the Catrambones encountered a floating jacket which had been abandoned by a migrant, and began to realise the scale of the unfolding humanitarian crisis. This was followed by a statement from Pope Francis urging business entrepreneurs to provide more assistance, and together this spurred them to form Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), a privately-run search and rescue operation working to save lives among migrants trying to cross to Europe. The two bought a trawler, MV Phoenix, under the auspices of Tangiers Group, and invested a further $2.3 million US dollars of their own money before beginning operations in August 2014. By the end of that year, they estimated they had rescued some 3,000 people. In 2015, they began operating additional vessels, and expanded operations into the Aegean Sea.

She is the first female Hausa writer from Northern Nigeria to have written a published novel. Hafsat hails from Kofar Mata quarters of Kano City of Kano State Nigeria.  Early life  Hafsat Abdulwaheed was born on May 5, 1952. She is a Nigerian author who writes mainly in Hausa. She is a poet, and a women's rights activist. She hails from Kofar Mata quarters of Kano City, Northern Nigeria. She did her primary education at Shahuci primary School and secondary school at Provincial Girls School currently known as Shekara Girls Secondary School, both in Kano State. She started writing in her primary school days. She married Muhammed Ahmed Abdulwaheed on January 25, 1966 In the early 1970s she became the first female Hausa writer to have her novel published. In the 2000s, she attempted to contest in the governorship election in the Northern Nigerian State of Zamfara. She has written more than 30 books, only five of which have been published. She has a number of children and the eldest among them is Kadaria Amed, a journalist Writing career Hafsat Abdulwaheed started writing when she was in primary school, where she wrote folk tales and she received awards. She once received an award from the British Council when she was either in primary four or five. In 1970 she entered one of her stories, So Aljannar Duniya (\\"Love is Paradise on Earth\\"), which she wrote when she was in primary five, in a literary competition organized by the Northern Nigerian Publishing Company (NNPC). The book was inspired by the experiences of her elder sister who at that time married a Libyan and the cultural differences began to generate friction in the marriage. She reviewed and edited it before it was submitted. The book, which is her best known book, came second in the competition. So Aljannar Duniya has been adjudged by analysts as the precursor to a genre of modern Hausa writing known as Littattafan Soyayya or \\"Love Books\\", or what is known as \\"Kano Market Literature\\". Cara Giaimo quotes Abdallah Uba Adamu and Graham Furniss as saying, '...it was this book that \\"really set the world alight to [Hausa] love-story writing...\\".' Hafsat Abdulwaheed has written more than 30 books, fiction and non-fiction. Of these, in addition to So Aljannar Duniya, Yardubu Mai Tambotsai (\\"'Yardubu the Possessed\\" - fiction), Nasiha ga Ma'aura (Admonition for the Married Couple - non-fiction), Namijin Maza Tauraron Annabawa (non-fiction on the life of Prophet Muhammad), as well as a book of poetry, her first in English, Ancient Dance, have been published. Politics Abdulwaheed has been a member of a women's rights group in Nigeria called Baobab. When the country returned to democratic governance in 1999 after prolonged military rule, the group observed that there were no women in the cabinet of the North-Western State of Zamfara, where Hafsat has been living with her husband for many years. At one time, she said, \\"the leadership of the group went to visit the governor and expressed their displeasure at this development. I didn't go with them because I wasn't given to keeping quiet when I felt something wasn't right. \\"When they came back, they told me that the governor had said there was no woman in Zamfara educated enough to serve in his cabinet, and I thought that was an insult, because in my house alone my daughters were very educated. \\"I then said, 'Well, we are not only going to demand for the position of a commissioner, we are going to take away his seat'. And I decided that I would contest the governor's seat in the next election\\". Her dream was not to be, however, because her decision was greeted with an uproar. \\"You know in the North it is unusual for a woman to say she wants to do anything for the public good, much less assume leadership positions\\", she says. Following the condemnation of her proposed candidature by Muslim scholars, the party on whose platform she wanted to contest denied her its backing and, in the end, her father prevailed on her to jettison the idea, even though she had printed posters and other campaign paraphernalia.

Few Mau Mau women became active fighters, and Muthoni is the only woman to have attained the Mau Mau rank of field- marshal.  Early life  Muthoni wa Kirima was born in 1931 to parents working on a European farm in Kenya's central region. Her journey as a revolutionary started when she was a girl, saving money to fund Jomo Kenyatta's travels abroad. After her marriage to General Mutungi, she moved to a village reserve for Africans in Nyeri before joining the Mau Mau.  In the Mau Mau uprising  In her 20s, she worked as a spy for Mau Mau fighters who had camped in the forest when war broke out in 1952. During the war, Muthoni was wounded on two occasions. On one, she and seven other fighters were attacked. She was able to crawl to safety with a gunshot wound in her shoulder, but all the others were killed. Muthoni was never caught in the forest.

Early life Katlo Siyanda Mohutsiwa was born in 1993 in Swaziland, where her mother is from and moved to Botswana, where her father is from when she was very young. Her initial language was SiSwati, but relocating not only changed her language, but brought her awareness of having lost her Swazi identity and becoming part of the shared history of African identity.

The hashtag was used over 61,000 times. When asked what inspired her original post, Mohutsiwa responded \\"I thought it would be a fun way for Africans to laugh at themselves and each other by putting geopolitics in a comedic light.\\" The discussion turned to another on-line media platform, TedTalks, when Mohutsiwa was invited to discuss how social media is being used to transform social conversation.

Her main mediums of choice include photography, collage, music, writing and video. Nonetheless, her work is characterized by a predominance of content over medium, exploring the relationship between contraries from an autobiographical and deconstructionist point of view. The absence of academic training and the scarce institutional coverage contribute to locate her in the outskirts of the mainstream art context, and digital platforms like Tumblr, Flickr or YouTube are her usual exhibition channels. She has lived and worked at Madrid and Barcelona.  Exhibitions  * 2009 – \\"Honne\\". Individual exhibition at Fundació Martí Vicens (Pollença). * 2013 – \\"Tots som putes\\" (Spanish for \\"We are all prostitutes\\").

Individual exhibition at 33/45 bar Barcelona.  Ruidos Salvajes  One of the reasons why in 2013 she went to live in Barcelona was the will to experience closely the emerging dark wave and punk scene that existed there, as it is explicited in the anthropological character of her photographic work of that period. But besides photography, she and Bernat from Orden Mundial decided to start a videographical documentation project under the moniker of Ruidos Salvajes (Spanish for \\"Wild Noises\\"), in which by the means of an homonymous YouTube channel they went on uploading an inventory of video recordings of concerts that mapped that scene. Bands like Belgrado, Una Bèstia Incontrolable, +++, Orden Mundial, ·Y·, Maquina Muerta, Crimen de Estado, Demonios Salvajes, Diät, Pena Máxima, COÀGUL, Pharmakon, Barcelona, Siega and Absurdo are part of the recordings of this platform, that ceased to exist when one year later Bernat left Barcelona and Adriana centered herself in other priorities.  Musical projects  From the time she spent in Buenos Aires when she was 19 years old and in her successive cities of residence, Adriana Petit has worked in several rather unsuccessful ephemeral musical projects, which have been more fruitful as drafts that helped to configure her quest for her own sound language than as music bands in the conventional sense of the term. Sometimes these projects worked at the same time as a creative means of experiential recording, which at the end is nothing more than the translation of her general work's autobiographical constant into sound. = Muso Fantasma = From 2007 to 2013 Adriana was part of a duo called Muso Fntasma, together with argentinian Pedro Amoidio from the band called Dios. Musically, Muso Fantasma is based in sound collage and spoken word, using samplers, effects, keyboards, electric guitar and industrial percussions. In 2009 they released a CD album called \\"Se puede bailar con los demonios pero siempre en actitud de fiesta\\" (Spanish for \\"You can dance with the demons but always in a party mood\\") on the Greek label More Mars, as the second instalment of the \\"Anarthria\\" series. = V = In 2013 Adriana started a post-punk band called \\"V\\", together with Rafa (from the bands Orden Mundial, Trance and Escorpio) and the artist Andrea Jarales, from which it only exists one video recording played live in a rehearsal room. = Esperit Maleït = Esperit Maleït (Catalan for \\"Cursed Spirit\\") was a sound and collage-installation art project developed by Adriana together with Andrea Jarales in an artist-in-residence program in the Catalan village of Moià, in the context of the Ex Abrupto 2014 Art Festival. By the means of manipulating words and sounds extracted from Moià's anthropological environment, Esperit Maleït was created just for the occasion and it was exclusively formalized in the shape of a tuned room and a concert. = Carne Roja = Carne Roja (Spanish for \\"Red Meat\\") was a musical project that Adriana started to develop solo along 2015. In a first stage Carne Roja consisted in single songs with an explicit neofolk approach that she uploaded at Bandcamp one by one, including a Death in June cover and a collaboration with Oriol Roca. After a short pause, during the same year she digitally published a first 6-track digital EP titled \\"Érase\\" (Spanish for \\"It was\\"), more noise-industrially oriented and with lyrics constructed from cut-ups from her own writings. = Mort Al Juny = In summer 2016 Adriana joined Mort Al Juny (Catalan for \\"Death in June\\") a project of videgraphical re-interpretations of Death in June songs in which Daniel Sedcontra and Marc O'Callaghan were working at the time. Adriana brought her aesthetics and audiovisual influence unto the project. = Adriana Petit = In a 2016 interview Adriana suggested that whenever Carne Roja got to the point of finding its own sound and being capable of playing live concerts, then it would cease to be called as it was and Adriana would start to use her own name. That first performance with her own name became real on 17 October 2016 at Freedonia venue in Barcelona, in the context of the second \\"Vigilar y Castigar\\" showcase commissioned by the Barcelonian label Cønjuntø Vacíø.  Album covers  Some of Adriana Petit's photographies have been published as LP album covers, like that for the \\"I Can't Give You The Life You Want\\" compilation by the German label Blackest Ever Black or the one for the \\"Tot Encaixa!\\" album by Catalan musician Coàgul.

For the 2017 season, he totaled 33 strikeouts in 41 innings and a 7.34 ERA. In 2018, the Padres intended to develop Díaz as a starter, and he was optioned early in the spring to minor league camp. Díaz began the season with the Double-A San Antonio Missions, where the Padres tried to stretch out his arm, and then was promoted to Triple-A El Paso in mid-May.. He was moved back to San Antonio in June after struggling with El Paso. The Padres called up Díaz for a single game at the beginning of July to help rest an over-extended bullpen. Díaz struck out four batters in one of the two scoreless innings he pitched, becoming only the second Padre to accomplish the feat. Díaz returned to the Major League club in mid-August and stayed with the team for the remainder of the season, working out of the bullpen. He finished with a 4.82 ERA, 30 strike-outs, and 12 walks in 18 innings at the big league level. In his 65 innings with San Antonio, he had a 2.35 ERA and 66 strike-outs versus 30 walks.

L. Lucas. His second novel, first published in 1930, it is a story of love, society and politics in the France of 1775–1776, set largely in Picardy and Paris, which locations form its two parts. Plot summary Cécile, 18, and Andrée, 23, are daughters of the Marquis de Maurepaire of Vraulx Saint-Mein in Picardy. Cécile is a joyous may-fly of a girl, just out of her convent and at once married off by her father, for money, to serious Gabriel de Rieux, 25 (\\"my heavenly bridegroom\\" Lucas, Cécile (London 1930), p.5), whom she does not love. Andrée is a young philosophe, romantic about one thing (love), sceptical about all else. She is married to the dashing Gaston, Vicomte de Launay, 30, a proto- Romantic, who makes her miserable by his affair with a fawn-like peasant-girl, whom he swept into his saddle one moonlit evening in the woods. (He is a disciple of Rousseau.) Andrée and Gaston quarrel about this, about their children's education, and about politics. A colleague of Turgot, the reformist Finance Minister, Gaston is shocked by the condition of the rural poor and sets about reforming the estates of his father-in-law and those of his father, the bluff sensible old Comte de Launay – to the mockery and head-shaking of the noblesse and the gratitude of the paysans. The unhappy Andrée is advised by her Parisian aunt, the worldly Madame de Lavaganne, that she must come to Paris and seek distraction. In Paris Andrée frequents her aunt's salon. Cécile meanwhile longs for Paris and for \\"life\\". Gabriel, aware that she does not love him and fearing rivals, is reluctant to let her go to the capital. At the château she flirts with her husband's teenage brother, who falls in love with her. Gabriel takes Andrée's advice and gives way. In Paris Cécile takes a lover, the Abbé Maurice d'Ailly, \\"a pleasant little fox among the vines of Paris\\".Lucas, Cécile (London 1930), p.110 Gaston takes a second mistress, Madame d'Aymery, whose only idea is \\"to look ravishing and to be ravished\\".Lucas, Cécile (London 1930), p. 237 Andrée soon finds out; the discovery kills her love. She learns, too, that Dick Elliot, a young English army officer on convalescent leave, has fallen in love with her: :\\"I might be a bridge for you away from this unhappiness\\" [he tells her]. \\"A bridge may be short, my darling, yet save a whole world of weariness.\\" Lucas, Cécile (London 1930), p. 246 On a visit to Saint-Cyr they become lovers. She informs Gaston, who knows he has deserved it. With Turgot fallen, he leaves for America as volunteer in Washington's forces. Months pass, gay with Parisian pleasures. Gabriel discovers Cécile's affair: when they are riding together in her carriage and the coachman is nodding, her horses stop unbidden outside her lover's front door. Stung by Cécile's hatred of him and his religion, he turns vindictive. He asks her father to apply for a lettre de cachet. One evening at a ball Cécile is arrested de la part du roi [:on behalf of the king]. Maurice deserts her and escapes. Andrée, frantic, knowing that such \\"disappearances\\" of women of good family are usually final, confronts Gabriel and asks him to relent. He wavers, looks out of the window, sees Dick waiting in Cécile's carriage – and rejects her appeal. She returns to the family château, noticing in passing that without Gaston the estates have gone to rack and ruin, and asks her father to use his influence – only to learn with horror that it was he who ordered the arrest. Telling her father he will never see her again, she rushes out of the château and into the night. Back in Paris Dick fights a duel with Gabriel. Both men are wounded. The authorities try to keep Cécile's identity and movements secret as they transfer her between prisons, but everywhere Madame de Rieux is taken, her looks and charm leave well-wishers, and her ingenuity clues. (She knows her sister will try to find and rescue her.) Andrée and Dick, with the help of their streetwise servants – one of many comic touches in the novel – trace Cécile across France to a convent beyond Nancy. They plan a rescue. Gaston returns from America unexpectedly, disillusioned with the needless bloodshed. He learns that in his absence his father has been killed in a confrontation with poachers. He is just in time to take the wounded Dick's place in the attempt to rescue Cécile. He has at last learnt to value Andrée: but too late – she cannot give up Dick, though Dick has now been recalled to his Regiment in the American War. Gaston requests an audience with the King, officially to give a first-hand account of events in America and to advise against French intervention, but privately to appeal for the release of Cécile. In a memorable scene, Vergennes escorts Gaston to Versailles. The American information is welcomed by Louis, who had regretted the fall of Turgot; the private appeal falls on deaf ears. In her incarceration Cécile learns from the Mother Superior that it was her father who ordered her arrest. Stunned, she attempts to escape alone that night. She is fatally injured in a fall. Gaston and Andrée, unaware, arrive just hours too late. Getting no response from her window they break into the nunnery and find the community in mourning for Cécile, who has won the hearts of the nuns in her brief time with them. Brushing past a distraught Gabriel, also just arrived, they start back for Paris in the desolation of a grey dawn. Background The pain of marital break-up looms large in the novel, which was written in the aftermath of Lucas's failed marriage to E. B. C. Jones, to which passages indirectly refer, as Lucas's friends noticed. \\"I can see that in writing Cécile you were, in a sense, clearing up your own history,\\" wrote T. E. Lawrence to Lucas in 1930.T. E. Lawrence letter to F. L. Lucas, 3 May 1930, in Garnett, David, ed., The Letters of T.E. Lawrence (London, 1930), p.691 :\\"You seemed intolerably dear to lose\\" [Gaston tells Andrée on his return from America], \\"now that I had lost you; and in the shadow of that loss our differences seemed pitiful things, compared with all that we had in common. For, after all, we both cared for courage and freedom and generosity and pity... Why should our disagreements have mattered?\\" Lucas, Cécile (London 1930), p. 278 The French 18th century, its history and literature, its philosophes and encyclopédistes, its salon hostesses and letter-writers, was one Lucas knew through and through. He shared the Bloomsbury conviction that European civilisation had reached a high point (for all its shortcomings) in the Siècle des Lumières,Smith, Adrian, The New Statesman: Portrait of a Political Weekly, 1913-1931 (London 1996) and in particular in the brilliant French women that had graced it.Lucas, The Art of Living (London 1959), p.261-272 Lucas returned to the 18th century French setting in his short story 'Madame de Malitourn's Cold' (1936) about an estranged aristocratic couple, each unfaithful to the other, but brought together again by a comic misunderstanding.Lucas, F. L., \\"Madame de Malitourn’s Cold : A Story\\", Cornhill Magazine, Dec. 1936, pp. 684-701; reprinted in Lucas’s The Woman Clothed with the Sun, and other stories (London, 1937) Cécile was the first of three novels and one novella Lucas set in the period 1775-1812. Lucas entered the novel for Chatto & Windus's Historical Novel Competition, announced in the press in January 1928, with manuscripts to be submitted by June 1929.The Nation and Athenaeum, 14 January 1928 The judges were E. M. Forster, George Gordon and R. H. Mottram. That the conscientious Forster was a friend of Lucas's may have counted against Cécile, which was bracketed for Second Prize, to the puzzlement of some reviewers who thought it finer than the winning novel, Margaret Irwin's None So Pretty (1930).The Spectator, 28 June 1930The Cambridge Review, 13 June 1930 Themes As a novel about the ruling classes in the decade before the Revolution, Cécile is in part a work of social criticism, not unrelated to the 1920s, as some reviewers noted, with intimations of the coming deluge. In parallel, the American Revolution reaches its climax in the months covered by the novel, touching the lives of a number of the characters and deeply impressing European onlookers. The struggle for freedom is thus explored on both individual and social levels. Cécile, in addition, contrasts the attitudes of the generations, examines various views of love, and, like Lucas's later novels Doctor Dido (1938) and The English Agent (1969), traces the tension between 18th-century rationalism and, in varying forms, Romantic \\"enthusiasm\\" and unreason. Rousseau's ideas are presented unsympathetically, as they are in Doctor Dido. Lucas saw Rousseau as a harmful influence, undermining the balance and good sense achieved in the Age of Enlightenment. Reception Cécile was the best received of Lucas's novels. The New Statesman described it as a \\"tenderly brilliant story\\".'Proteus' in the New Statesman, 24 May 1930 \\"For grace and style and insight into character,\\" wrote Kathleen Tomlinson in The Nation and Athenaeum, \\"Cécile is reminiscent of Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin. Only reminiscent, for Mr Lucas has a more profound philosophy, or wisdom, and is not content with the challenge and interplay of the individual, but extends his psychological understanding to classes and nations.\\" Kathleen Tomlinson in The Nation and Athenaeum, 7 June 1930 \\"His extraordinary gift for delightful persiflage,\\" noted the New York Bookman, \\"contributes not a little towards making this novel almost as dix-huitième in spirit as Manon Lescaut is in fact.\\" Justin O'Brien in The Bookman, Oct. 1930, p.173 Vita Sackville-West also praised the novel: \\"It seemed to me to be full of the deepest and truest feeling,\\" she wrote, \\"never sentimental, but always convincing and extremely moving. The relationship between Andrée and Gaston is admirably true to nature. No-one could fail to be moved by this picture of a woman struggling against her own love for a husband who disappoints and betrays her at every turn.\\" Vita Sackville-West in The Spectator, 28 June 1930 Lucas dedicated Cécile to T. E. Lawrence, who admired his poetry and who had said encouraging things about his first novel, The River Flows (1926). Lawrence, in a letter to Lucas thanking him for the dedication, singled out \\"that picture of the King, and Vergennes and Gaston, near the end. That is magnificent. You got there as near to the reality of a royal audience as anyone could.\\" T. E. Lawrence letter to F. L. Lucas, 3 May 1930, in Garnett, David, ed., The Letters of T.E. Lawrence (London, 1930), p.690 Some reviewers thought the novel \\"rather static\\",The Times Literary Supplement, 8 May 1930, p.390 Naomi Mitchison noting that, though \\"lucid and distinguished\\" as a work of art, there was not enough action to make the novel \\"a selling success\\".Naomi Mitchison in Time and Tide, 24 May 1930, p.674 Opinion differed on the long salon scenes, The Spectator considering that they \\"would of themselves be enough to stamp the book with distinction\\",Gilbert Thomas in The Spectator, 17 May 1930 Basil Davenport in the Saturday Review of Literature that \\"though the talk is extraordinarily good, some readers will feel there is too much of it\\" and a distraction from the \\"excellent\\" plot.Basil Davenport in The Saturday Review of Literature, 11 Oct. 1930 Publishing history The novel was published on 1 May 1930 by Chatto & Windus of London, and reprinted in Chatto's 'Centaur Library' in July of that year and again in November 1931. The first American edition, by Henry Holt and Company of New York, 1930, was, unusually for Lucas's US editions, re-set.

She is notable for her surrealist paintings, in which apparently unconnected objects appear together in unfamiliar, often outdoor, environments. Some of her paintings depict landscapes and landmarks close to, or within, her native town of Derby. Painting by surrealist artist Marion Adnams  Biography  Alter Ego, by Marion Adnams, oil on board, 1945 (Derby Museums Trust) Adnams was born on 3 December 1898 at 22 Otter Street, Derby, the only daughter of John Frederick Adnams and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Smith. Her artistic interests were encouraged from an early age by her father, himself a woodwork teacher at Derby School. After attending Parkfield Cedars School in Derby, she expressed a desire to study art but was instead urged to go on and study at University College, Nottingham, where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Modern Languages in 1919. Art and making were never far behind her, however, and between 1927 and 1930, Adnams travelled to Belgium, France, and Italy, executing woodcuts of the architecture she encountered en route, and exhibiting them to some acclaim at Derby Art Gallery and elsewhere locally with the Derby Women's Art Club. She began her career not as a language teacher, but as art mistress at Derby's Central School for Girls before being recommended for a transfer to the newly opened Homelands Grammar School for Girls, by the Derbyshire Education Committee, in October 1937. She was appointed senior lecturer at Derby Diocesan Training College in 1948, where she rose to become Head of Art. It was between 1938 and 1970, that Adnams painted the surrealist works for which she is principally known, exhibiting at the British Art Centre in London, alongside Duncan Grant, Augustus John, Henry Moore, Jacob Epstein, and Eileen Agar. In 1944 she exhibited her work at the Modern Art Gallery in London, alongside Jack Bilbo and Max Ernst. In 1939, she sold her first painting, The Living Tree (1939), to Manchester Art Gallery for inclusion in their Rutherson Collection of Modern Art for Schools. Further sales of her paintings to Derby Art Gallery from 1945 and to the Salford Museum and Art Gallery and Nottingham Castle Museums from the early 1950s have ensured her work a measure of public presence. Adnams retired in 1960 aged sixty-one, using her time to develop her art in new directions. She acquired a second home in France, producing paintings and drawings influenced by the landscape of Provence and elsewhere. In 1966 she painted a series of murals for Immanuel Church in Stapenhill, near Burton upon Trent. In 1968, at the age of seventy, she became partially blind. As her condition worsened, she was left unable to paint. She died in Derby on Tuesday 24 October 1995, aged ninety-six years old. Her funeral was held at Derby Cathedral on Thursday 2 November 1995, before burial at Nottingham Road Cemetery in Derby.

According to IBGE (2004), Brazil has its territory occupied by six terrestrial biomes and one marine biome. Terminology The term \\"biome\\" has several meanings. In a narrow sense (e.g., Whittaker, 1975; Coutinho, 2006), used in literature, it names physio-functionally defined small-scale areas, habitat types or ecosystem types. Although it includes both the plants and the animals and microorganisms of a community, in practice, it is defined by the climate and physiognomy or general appearance of the plants of the community. In the broad sense, adopted by Joly et al. (1978) and the IBGE (2016), biome can be understood as a synonym of \\"biogeographic province\\" (e.g., Rizzini, 1963, Eiten 1977, Cabrera and Willink 1980, the term \\"floristic province\\" or \\"phytogeographic\\" is used when considering plant species only), or as an approximate synonym of \\"morphoclimatic and phytogeographical domain\\" (Ab'Sáber, 1967, 2003). In this broad sense, the \\"Projeto Radam\\" (Veloso et al., 1973) applies the term \\"phytoecological region\\", and IBGE (2012) adopts the term \\"floristic region\\". However, the term \\"region\\" must be understood, in this case, in the generalist sense of \\"area\\". The terms \\"region\\" and \\"province\\" have specific traditional meanings in phytogeography: regions are areas characterized by endemic families, and provinces are areas characterized by endemic genera and species. In the case of the 'domains' of Ab'Sáber (1967, 2003), the defined area is characterized by the predominance of certain geomorphological and climatic characteristics, and also by a certain predominant floristic province (vegetative type). However, there is no uniformity: enclaves from other provinces, characteristics of other domains, may occur within this area. Terrestrial biomes =Amazônia= Rain forest The Amazon Forest is the largest forest formation on the planet, conditioned by the humid equatorial climate. It is equivalent to 35% of the forest areas of the planet. It has a wide variety of plant formations. Most of Brazil is covered by the Amazon's forest areas and this number is around 60% and within that there is about 55,000 different species of plants populating it. =Cerrado= The Cerrado presents diverse regions, ranging from clean fields devoid of woody vegetation to cerradão, a dense tree formation. Its climate is particularly striking, presenting two well-defined seasons. The Cerrado is made up of grasslands, Savannahs and dry forests. It is the second largest biome behind the Amazon in South America. It covers around 21% of territory in Brazil and is located in the highlands of central Brazil. =Mata Atlântica= Mata Atlântica The Atlantic Forest is composed of a series of ecosystems with very different structures and composition of flowers, as well as the climatic characteristics of the region where it occurs, having as a common element the exposure to the humid winds that blow from the ocean. =Caatinga= The Caatinga has dry soils and its vegetation is formed by palm trees, such as buriti, oiticica, babassu and carnauba. Much of its northeastern part suffers a high risk of desertification due to the degradation of vegetation cover and soil. Caatinga is located in the Northeast part of South America and covers about 12% of the region. =Pampa= Pampa The Pampa is characterized by the amount of herbaceous species and several typologies of the country, composing in some regions, environments integrated with the Araucária forest. The flat plains of the Gaucho plains and plateaus and the soft-wavy reliefs are colonized by pioneering species that form an open savanna vegetation. =Pantanal= The Pantanal is an alluvial plain influenced by rivers that drain the basin of the Upper Paraguay, where it develops a fauna and flora of rare beauty and abundance. This ecosystem is formed by largely sandy terrains, covered by different physiognomies due to the variety of microregions and flood regimes. Marine biome The Fernando de Noronha archipelago. The Brazilian marine biome is located on the \\"Marine Zone of Brazil\\", the continental shelf biotope, and presents several ecosystems. The Brazilian Coastal Zone has as distinctive aspects in its long extension through different biomes that arrive until the coast, the biome of the Amazônia, the biome of the Caatinga and bioma of the Atlantic Forest. These biomes with wide variety of species and ecosystems, cover more than 8,500 km of coastline.

Name Norman Tindale who undertook the first ethnographic studies on Groote Eylandt, stated that during his state in 1921-1922, the traditional name for the tribe was the Ingura (with Ingurawala their term for the language). Elders who recalled him testified that this was indeed the old term for the Warnindhilyagwa, the latter being an innovation from the east that began to gain currency only in the postwar period. Language The Warnindhilyagwa are speakers of Anindilyakwa. In the view of Arthur Capell, Anindilyakwa displayed perhaps \\"the most complicated grammar of any Australian language\\", a distinction it has come to share with the nearby mainland language of Nunggubuyu also known as Wubuy. Anindilyakwa is unrelated to the Pama–Nyungan language family, which contains most Australian languages. It shares similar grammatical structures with Wubuy, though the two differ in basic vocabulary. There is a dialect variant, spoken mainly by members of the Umbakumba community, which uses laminopalatals in place of laminodentals, and a stronger pitch. Anindilyakwa is characterized by prefixation for number, person and gender with regard to all (an exception concerns loanwords) nouns, adjectives, personal and demonstrative adjectives, and words are characteristically lengthy, ranging from 2 to as many as 14 syllables. An \\"eyelash\\" for example is mwamwitjingwila mwanpwa (eye's plumage), and a man is nanimwamwalya (human male possessing body fat). Country and ecology Warnindhilyagwa land extends some encompassing three islands, Groote Eylandt, Bickerton, and Woodahs. Groote Eylandt has a variety of habitats: dense stands on monsoon forests rising behind coastal sand dunes, alternating with mangrove and mudflats. Sandstone outcrops and laterite provide excellent niches for shellfish. The fruit of the Zamia Palm called burrawang which though containing the deadly toxin macrozamin is reported to have been generally avoided, except as a \\"hard time food\\". But the Warnindhilyagwa have several methods of making it edible, by leaching it in running water for several days. Social organization Opinion differs with regard to the number of bands composing the Warnindhilyagwa. Norman Tindale estimated they were divided into 6 hordes, Peter Worsley counted either 5 or 12. Some of the bands listed in Tindale are: * Andiljaugwa * Wani-Ndiljaugwa. (horde or clan) * Awarikpa * Amakurupa. toponymic horde name. History Macassans from Sulawesi traded with northern Australian Aboriginal people long before the arrival of Europeans. Exploiting the monsoonal winds in December of each year, they sailed down in praus, to trade for native trepang, beeswax, ironwood and pearls, which they brought back to supply the southern Chinese market, where, in particular, trepang was highly sought after as a delicacy. In exchange, they provided beads, metal, canoe technologies, sails, ceramics, earthenware pots and fishing hooks. The scale of the enterprise was large: Matthew Flinders came across one expedition involving some 1,000 sailors in 60 praus. After the Australian government started to impose taxes on this kind of Macassar-northern Australian commerce in the 1880s, it experienced a down- turn, the last trading season concluding in 1906-7. They introduced tamarind to the island. The presence in four families of genetically transmitted Machado–Joseph disease is thought to derive from a Makassar ancestor who carried the disease. By the 1950s, the Warnindhilyagwa had moved into settlements like Angurugu and Umbakumba, ran by a Church group called the Church Missionary Society. However, their lives would be drastically altered when manganese was discovered on the island. In 1964, the Groote Eylandt Mining Company was given lease over the island, in exchange for royalty payments to the Church Missionary Society. The first shipments of manganese ore left in 1966, and currently, the mine is producing over 3 million tonnes of manganese a year, over 15% of total world production. The mine is expected to continue production at least until 2027. The establishment of the mine caused upheavals in traditional land sensibilities, since the indigenous people were forcibly dislocated and compelled to live in close proximity to one another. As a consequence, two clans, the Mamrika and Amagula have been feuding for some decades, perhaps reflecting a longer historical enmity, and on occasion eruptions of violence, involving also machetes, have broken out.

Built in 1875, it is one of a small number of brick houses built in the town in the late 19th century, and is architecturally a distinctive vernacular blend of Gothic and Italianate styles. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Lee Tracy House stands near the center of Shelburne village, on the west side US 7 a short way north of its junction with Harbor Road. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a side gable roof. The roof is steeply pitched in the Gothic style, and has a front-facing central gable. The front facade is three bays wide, with a single-story porch extending around the south side to a polygonal bay. On the ground floor, only the outer bays have windows, both elongated sash. On the second floor, the windows are set in segmented-arch openings, with stone sills and headers; the central bay is larger, with a pair of windows in the opening. The main entrance is on the north side of the house, set under a separate porch, featuring the same elaborate woodwork found on that facing the road. A contemporary two-story ell extends to the rear of the main block, and the property also includes a period carriage barn. with The house was built in 1875 for Lee Tracy, a local wool trader. Family lore claims that a man named Edgerton was responsible for its design, which is clearly based on the principles laid out by Calvert Vaux in his treatise Villas and Cottages. Although it is not as elaborate as some Gothic and Italianate houses, its massing and scale are clearly within those styles, as are its relatively modest stylistic details.

Early life Brown was born in Glasgow in 1846. Her mother was Catherine Dyce, sister of painter William Dyce, and her father was Free Church minister Reverend David Brown. She was raised in Aberdeen and lived on Dee Street, and studied music and singing. After the death of her mother in the 1880s, Brown moved to London where she became concerned about conditions for young women working in factories and living in slums across the city. Career After moving to London, Brown developed an interest in the harsh working conditions and poverty suffered by factory girls in the East End and also in the West End of the city. Brown and a friend disguised themselves as factory girls to visit slums in the West End, and Brown documented their experiences in the book Only a Factory Girl, which raised £2,000 () that she used to purchase a property in Lisson Grove, where she founded the Shaftesbury Institute. =The Shaftesbury Institute= The Institute initially provided a safe night shelter for women and a crèche, which Brown expanded to provide Bible classes throughout the West End, a training home for girls and a men's labour home. Brown served as the superintendent and honorary president of the Institute, which was funded by charitable donations. Brown was described as: > \\"A very remarkable woman, full of faith and of consequent zeal, in the noble > cause of benefiting her poor and degraded sisters,\\" (The Times, 10 November > 1908) She continued to work on developing the Institute, including fundraising for new premises, until her death at the Shaftesbury Institute on 5 November 1908.

She was chief executive of High House Purfleet, director of the Foundation for Future London, the organisation responsible for developing the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as a new cultural and educational district and is currently Director of Employment, Skills and Culture at the London Borough of Islington. She was previously executive director of Arts Council England, chief executive of East England Arts, and chief officer of arts and culture at Dundee City Council. The financial arrangements for her departure from Arts Council England for High House Production Park caused some adverse comment in the arts press. Her appointment was announced by High House chairman Tony Hall, now director general of the BBC. Early life Stark grew up in the North-East of England, where she attended school. She studied theatre at Dartington College of Arts, later moving to postgraduate study at the University of Birmingham. Career Stark first worked in theatre before becoming the arts chief for the City of Sunderland and later Dundee City Council, where she worked on major regeneration programmes using the creative industries to drive local economic growth. At Dundee, she was key in ensuring £5.6 million in National Lottery funding for the Dundee Centre for Contemporary Arts, the largest award to a Scottish institution at that point, and was suggested as a possible head of the Scottish Arts Council. In 1999, she became Chief Executive of the Eastern Arts Board, the Arts Council England Executive Director for the East and South East, and a member of their National Executive Board. Whilst in this post, \\"she devised a highly successful investment strategy that generated over £125 million for a series of world class arts centres\\". In 2012, Stark left to become Chief Executive of the new High House Purfleet in Essex. There, she led the team that created a national centre of excellence for creative industries. The purpose-built centre is shared by other organisations such as the Royal Opera House, Creative & Cultural Skills and Acme Studios, and built on work Stark had done to support redevelopment while at the Arts Council. After the end of the 2012 London Olympics, a body was set up to redevelop the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London into a new cultural and educational hub as part of the Mayor of London’s 'Olympicopolis' project.

Early life  Born Lucy Kishindo in Malawi in 1943, she was the eldest of 11 children of an Anglican primary school teacher. She was educated at mission schools in southern Malawi and trained as a nurse in the UK.  Nursing  In September 1964, Lucy travelled to Scotland to study nursing at the South Edinburgh School of Nursing. In 1969, she met and married Tony Finch, son of the potter Ray Finch. He worked for the Forestry Commission around the world and Lucy travelled with him, working as a nurse in Britain, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. In 1997, while her husband was based in Kampala, Lucy Finch began volunteering at Hospice Africa Uganda, where she worked with Dr Anne Merriman in her pioneering, palliative care programme. A year later, she returned to Malawi to nurse her sister, who was dying of HIV-related meningitis. In the same hospital, a young man was dying in great pain and distress with no adequate pain relief. Lucy Finch vowed then, that with the knowledge and skills that she had, she would never again allow herself to be in that position where she could not help somebody who was suffering. Ndi Moyo In 2002, Lucy and Tony Finch returned to Malawi and she began to help local patients, providing them with paracetamol and other assistance. In 2005, her family and friends in the UK founded a charity to raise funds to support the work that she had started. After gathering resources, the hospice Ndi Moyo – \\"the place giving life\\" – was opened in the Salima District in 2007 by the Minister of Health, Marjorie Ngaunje. In 2016, it was the only hospice in all of Malawi. As of 2016, Ndi Moyo treats about 330 patients; trains and mentors health professionals; runs outreach clinics; and advocates for better end-of- life care. It provides home-based, patient-centred, holistic care to patients who would otherwise have little access to pain relief or end-of-life support. According to 2015 estimates, approximately 1 million people in Malawi are living with HIV/AIDS and many of these patients develop cancers in a country that has no curative public health cancer treatment. Recognition In 2013, Lucy Finch was recognised by Hospice Africa Uganda for her outstanding support in the promotion and development of palliative care in Uganda. In 2015, she was awarded a Certificate of Recognition by the Right Honourable Dr Peter Kumpalume, the Malawi Minister for Health. In 2016, she was recognised as one of the BBC's 100 Women for her work caring for the dying.

The game features the collaboration of writer Masato Kato and music composer Yasunori Mitsuda who both worked on Xenogears and the Chrono series of role- playing games. Another Eden involves time travel elements, where players explore different points in time. It was self-published and released for Android and iOS in Japan in April 2017, and worldwide in 2019. Ports for the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows were also announced.  Gameplay  Despite being a mobile game created on the GREE platform, the game has little focus on social interactions and log-in bonuses frequently found on the platform. The game is free to play, with in-app purchases for in-game items. The game features 66 chapter main scenario that continues to grow, with the gameplay involving the player time travelling through three main time periods; the past, present, and future. The game primarily plays as a side-scrolling JRPG, at times opening up for full 3D movement. The player directly maneuvers a character between locations and interacts with non-playable characters to progress through the game. Confrontations with enemy characters are played out with turn-based battles. New characters will join the party and grow stronger naturally over the course of the game flow, however the player may opt to spend \\"Chronos Stones\\" to obtain a larger roster of characters to use throughout the game. \\"Chronos Stones\\", which can be obtained naturally through playing the game, or bought through in-app purchases, allows access to the \\"Star Dreaming Hall\\", which allows the player to gamble gacha-style for a wide variety of characters. Plot The game centers around a boy named Aldo, the game's protagonist, and his sister Feinne. The two live plain and peaceful lives in a small village, however one day the Beast King appears and seeks to use Feinne's dormant abilities to erase humans from the world, leaving the planet only for beast-kin. Aldo desperately attempts to rescue his sister from the Beast King, but a distortion in space-time occurs in the air and whisks Aldo away 800 years into the future. Development and release Development on the game started in early 2015, with its first announcement occurring in September 2015, at that year's Tokyo Game Show. The game was revealed as a new project by Masato Kato, who had written and directed Chrono Cross, and wrote parts of Xenogears and Chrono Trigger. The game was developed by Wright Flyer Studios for iOS and Android devices on the GREE, Inc. platform, with Kato directing and writing the game's scenario and script. Kato collaborated with GREE producer Daisuke Takasaki, who previously worked on Puyo Puyo Quest, on the game, as they shared the same vision of putting a more traditional JRPG on mobile device, something Takasaki felt the platform generally lacked. Importance was placed on making free-range movement comfortable on button-less devices, something Takasaki felt was poorly, or not at all, implemented on many mobile RPGs. Graphics were kept two dimensional to help accommodate the game's large scope, with 2D graphics being cheaper and easier to create on a larger scale. This was necessary to realize Kato's large scope for the game's story as well. Similar to the Chrono series, the game is centered around time travel. Additionally, a \\"day and night\\" theme is also in the game. The game's soundtrack was primarily composed by Shunsuke Tsuchiya and Mariam Abounnasr, with the opening theme and a few additional tracks by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had previously worked with Kato on Xenogears and the Chrono series. The development team was initially unsure on whether or not voice acting should be implemented into the game, though after an impromptu questionnaire was issued to fans, over 70% favored its inclusion, so the team decided in favor of it. However, the limitations of the game being on mobile platforms lead to it only being partial voice acting, not full voice acting for every scene. A two-disc official soundtrack was released by Procyon Studio, Mitsuda's music label, on September 27, 2017. The game was initially targeting a release in mid-2016, but was later pushed back to April 12, 2017. Prior to the game's release, a sign-up for a 1,000 participant closed beta testing was held in late February 2017, and conducted for a week in March 2017. Post-release, the game received large-scale advertising and promotional support from GREE, including regularly released updates featuring new gameplay content. It was first released in English in selected countries on January 28, 2019, and later in more regions on June 26, 2019. In addition, a port for Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows is announced. Reception RPG Site praised the original Japanese release of the game, stating that despite it being on mobile devices, it still played like a \\"fun, traditional RPG\\" and that they could \\"barely call it a free-to-play game. The annoying trappings (like stamina and timers) are almost nonexistent\\". They also gave praise to the graphics, soundtrack, and post- release game updates.

Grave from a distance  Exhumation and headstone  Her body was discovered in 1933 (some sources say 1936) by peat diggers who came across her wooden coffin, her remains were well preserved in the peat. The procurator fiscal requested that she be buried in the same spot. In 1941 a group of soldiers dug up her body and referred to her as the Lady of Hoy. After this she was regularly dug up and quickly began to decompose. A concrete slab was therefore placed over the grave. In 1949 an American minister Reverend Kenwood Bryant visited Hoy and was so moved that he asked Mr Harry Berry, a customs officer, to create a proper headstone. This eventually happened 27 years later after Mr. Berry's retirement. However, due to the boggy ground a stone headstone was unsuitable and a fiberglass one was erected instead. Betty's grave is now a popular tourist site. The headstone reads \\"Here lies Betty Corrigall.\\"  In popular culture  In 2013, The Magnetic North released their debut album Orkney: Symphony of the Magnetic North. Founder member Erland Cooper states that the inspiration for the making of the album came from Corrigall's appearance to him in a dream, insisting that he wrote an album about his home.

Early life and education  Marion Atieno was born in Kenya and brought up in Nairobi. She attended Braeside School, Brookhouse School and St Mary's School in Kenya for her early education, before studying Business Administration at Macquarie University in Australia, graduating in 2006.  Career  She first worked at the Kenya tourism board as an intern before joining the media and advertising agency, Scangroup, as a media planner. She worked for the insurance firm, AoN, in Kampala, Uganda as an executive assistant before leaving in 2011 She chose to leave because while she was successful at her job, she did not feel fulfilled by the work; she said: \\"I was doing really well, but to what end was it?\\" Moon also wanted to do something that would be closer to home. Kenyan soils have been depleted over the years and so Moon decided to pursue using organic fertilisers, creating Wanda Organic in 2012. The choice of organic fertilizer was deliberate: inorganic types have helped deplete nutrients from the soil over time. She had visited Philippines and Thailand, where she learnt about organic fertilizers which had been successfully used in those countries. As she learned about organic fertilizers, she came in contact with Eliseo Cruiz, who had created a brand known as Plantmate. Her company, Wanda Organic imports organic fertiliser from the Philippines where it is cheaply produced. Moon sold her cars and house and moved back to her parents' home in order to make her business succeed. At first Moon had a difficult time raising capital, however, she was able to get a grant from USAID in 2014 for a proof-of-concept for her business. Moon, with funding from USAID had by 2014, conducted trials with farmers in 35 trial farms in Kenya. The end goal of the program is also to not just continue importing fertiliser, but to eventually set up production in Kenya. Moon's work has had a positive effect on farmers in the area who have seen better crop yields and improvements to their living standards.

Biography Gravestone for the Campbell family, including James and Jessie Campbell Campbell was born Janet Black on 26 March 1827 in Cross-Arthurlie in Renfrewshire. It is said that the idea of lectures for women in Glasgow arose out of her suggestion at a dinner party. She approached the University of Glasgow to request that lectures were started for women. Natural history, moral philosophy, English literature and astronomy lectures were among the first. They were so successful that the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women was set up with Campbell as its Vice President. In 1883 this became the first college for higher education of women in Scotland: Queen Margaret College (Glasgow). Campbell was instrumental in securing North Park House as a base for the college, convincing Scottish philanthropist and friend Isabella Elder to purchase it. She also led the fundraising campaign for the endowment fund. The college became part of the University of Glasgow in 1892. Campbell is on the University of Glasgow's World Changing website and was awarded an honorary degree (LLD) by the University of Glasgow in 1901.

She gave the first UK performance of Arnold Schoenberg’s Piano Concerto in 1945 and the first of Prokofiev’s Second Piano Concerto in 1955. Greenbaum was born in 1922 in Brighton, England to Polish parents and (like her brother two decades earlier) she received her first musical training at home. She went on to study at the Royal Academy of Music (1938-42) and then in Budapest. She first attracted notice as a pianist during the second world war as a regular performer at the famous National Gallery wartime lunchtime concerts organised by Myra Hess. The grand piano she owned for many years afterwards was scratched when the ceiling collapsed on it as she was hiding underneath during a German bombing raid. Her evident virtuosity quickly led to performances of challenging and otherwise neglected romantic and contemporary music repertoire, such as Liszt's Piano Concerto No 2 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Constant Lambert on 5 May 1945Radio Times, Issue 1126, 29 April 1945, p 18, and (on 30 May 1945 with Frederick Thurston and others) the first broadcast performance of Hindemith's Quartet for clarinet, violin, cello and pianoRadio Times Issue 1122, 1 April 1945, p 14 . On 17 February 1948 Greenbaum debuted Alan Bush's Le Quatorze Juillet. Other contemporary works she championed were James Iliff's Piano Sonata (which is dedicated to her), John Lambert's Piano Sonata (played at Morley College on 14 March 1954) and John Greenwood's Piano Quintet.The Times, 16 October 1953, p 2 She also performed Schoenberg's Phantasy, Op. 47, On 28 August 1945, aged just 23, Greenbaum made the first of 13 appearances as a soloist at the BBC Proms with a performance of Constant Lambert's The Rio Grande. It became her calling card, with Lambert saying that he preferred her interpretation to that of Hamilton Harty who premiered the piece in 1929. (She played it at the Proms for the final time on 15 August 1951 with the composer conducting, just days before his death). She followed this on 7 September 1945 with the first performance in England of Schoenberg's Piano Concerto, Basil Cameron conducting.\\"A Schoenberg Novelty\\",The Times, 8 September 1945 Despite some underlying hostility the work was received by the audience with unexpected enthusiasm, and (according to The Musical Times) she played with \\"immense courage\\".Musical Times Issue 1232, October 1945, p 315 Other Proms appearances included William Walton's Sinfonia Concertante (14 January 1947), John Ireland's Legend for piano and orchestra (10 September 1948), Alan Rawsthorne's Piano Concerto No 1 (7 September 1949), and the first UK hearing of Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2 (26 August 1955), by then 40 years old.The Times, 27 August 1955 In 1956 Greenbaum was one of three pianists (the others Margaret Kitchin and Robert Wood) performing Peter Racine Fricker's Concertante for three pianos, strings and percussion.The Times, 11 August, 1956 Her best known recordings include The Rio Grande (made in 1949) and Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor (made in 1957). These were both reissued in 2017 on the CRQ label. Greenbaum turned to composition in later life. She wrote a score for the play with dance Theresa by Julia Pascal, one of a trilogy of plays under the general title The Holocaust Trilogy, staged at the New End Theatre in Hampstead on 5 November 1995. Bells was composed in 1998. Song of Songs, a setting of the Old Testament, is scored for solo soprano with clarinet, horn, string trio, double bass and percussion. It received its first performance in 2006 as part of Jewish Culture Day at the Southbank Centre in London. Personal life In 1956, Greenbaum married psychiatrist Andrew Crowcroft, They had two children (Jonathan and Natasha). Andrew's posting to Toronto effectively ended Kyla's career as a pianist, but in 1978 they returned to the UK, living in Camden for twenty years, throwing parties for exiles, writers and musicians. Kyla did occasionally still perform during this time, sometimes under her married name, both in Canada and in the UK. For instance, on the 12 May 1979 she premiered (and subsequently recorded) the piano work Noospheres (1977) by the Canadian composer Charles Camilleri at Canada House. She was co-authoring a book on the lullaby with her husband at the time of his death in 2002. It remained unpublished. Kyla died in Hampstead, London on 15 June 2017.

Importance Erwinia papayae, the bacterial pathogen responsible for the disease, was first identified in 1931 in Java, Indonesia (Gardan et al. 2004), and has since spread to papaya growing countries worldwide—from the Caribbean to South America to South East Asia (Ollitrault et al. 2007). By the late 1960s, E. papayae had appeared in the West Indies, where it obliterated all the yields of the papaya cultivar ‘Solo,’ which because of its high fruit yields and quality was the only one grown in the fields (Ollitrault et al. 2007). Papayas are significant cash crops for the papaya-growing countries because of their rapid generation, high yields, and large market demand both locally and internationally (Ollitrault et al. 2007). In Malaysia, where the disease has plagued farmers for over a decade, papayas have an export value of approximately 24-28 million USD per year (Maktar et al. 2008). With bacterial crown rot affecting approximately 800 hectares of papaya on the Malaysian Peninsula alone (Maktar et al. 2008), this results in a huge loss in profit for the agricultural industry. Host and symptoms Although Erwinia papayae has been known to survive on leaves of cowpea, tomato, and rockmelon for a minimum of two weeks, the host range of bacterial crown rot is confined to papaya (Webb 1985). Inoculation with the pathogen of twenty-three common weed species and crops found in association with Philippine papaya fields found none of these species to be susceptible to the disease (Obrero 1980). Symptoms of bacterial crown rot begin as angular water-soaked lesions on leaf surfaces and eventually spread through veins and petioles to cause death to the canopy layer of leaves. Water-soaked cankers also appear on the stem, causing it to collapse, and spread to meristems, killing the growing tips of the plant (Webb 1985; Fullerton et al. 2011; Maktar et al. 2008). Water-soaked lesions can also appear on unripe fruit, and although they start small, the lesions can turn into firm depressions (Webb 1985). Dry conditions can allow infected plants to recover and produce unaffected, fruit-producing branches. Erwinia papayae is a Gram-negative, straight rod bacterium with peritrichous flagella, so diagnosis can be made using a Gram stain. On King’s medium B, colonies are creamy and mucoid with a non-diffusible blue pigment (Vawdrey 2011). Disease cycle The pathogen can survive in the seed of infected papaya, even after drying, for approximately 30 days (Obrero 1980). Thus far, seed-borne transmission is the predominant method of spread and infection; in fact, studies indicate the pathogen has the ability for long-range dispersal via seed (Ramachandran et al. 2015). Although symptoms can be seen year round, rain and splashing water aid in the transmission and exacerbate the disease (Webb 1985). The bacterium relies on wounds or natural plant openings to enter the papaya. Upon infection by the pathogen, juvenile stem tissue initially shows dark green, water-soaked lesions, which develop into putrid wet rot on the stems (Vawdrey 2011). E. papayae causes a systemic infection—coalescing brown angular lesions spread from the stem lamina to the crown meristems. The firm depressed lesions that progress on unripe fruit penetrate seed cavities. The pathogen does not survive longer than two weeks in soil—instead, the pathogen survives inside the infected vascular bundles of diseased papaya (Vawdrey 2011).

The band were formed in 2011 and have released an EP and two studio albums to date. Francis Tobolsky (flute, rhythm guitar, vocals), Tim George (lead guitar) and Patrik Dröge (bass guitar) are the founding members of the band and have remained in the line-up since. Leo Vaessen is the current drummer after several other drummers left the band. History In December 2011, singer Francis Tobolsky posted an advertisement in a student magazine with the headline 'Blues Brothers Wanted', with the intention of forming a band. Guitarist Tim George and drummer 'Pätz' joined Tobolsky for rehearsals throughout 2012 and the band's first line-up was complete when Patrik Dröge joined on bass in November the same year. Throughout 2013, Wucan started songwriting, recording and playing their first gigs as a band. They had also released demos and singles on YouTube. In July 2014, Pätz left the band shortly after the recording of the debut EP Vikarma. His replacement was a new drummer 'Ollie', who remained with the band for six months before leaving and was replaced by a further drummer 'Marc'. In February 2015, the band started preparing for their first studio album. A month later they were the main support act for Siena Root during their tour of mainland Europe. Marc only lasted two months in the band before being replaced with Leo Vaessen who was brought in for recordings for the debut album Sow The Wind. Their second studio album, Reap The Storm, was released in September 29, 2017. Style Wucan's music can be described as heavy 70s influenced folk rock with hints of stoner and doom. Fans and critics often compare the band's sound to Jethro Tull, because of the continuous use of flute, and Black Sabbath.

While young she travelled to the Ruhr area in search of work and a future. She arrived in Mülheim, where she learned bricklaying and later met Communist Party functionary Willy Zinke. They were married on 17 December 1910. Active initially in the Social Democratic Party, Zinke joined the Communist Party in Essen-Frohnhausen in 1920, and from 1927 to 1930 held the office of district women's chief (Bezirksfrauenleiterin) for the Communist Party for the Ruhr area. In 1928 she was elected to the Landtag of Prussia, in 1929 to the Essen City Parliament, and finally in 1930 to the German Reichstag, to which she belonged until 1933. Following the Nazi seizure of power, Zinke went into hiding in Essen and in the Waldeck countryside before emigrating to the Netherlands in the spring of 1933. In January 1934, she returned with her husband to Essen, where she was questioned by police. In 1934, she was expelled from the Communist Party because she was unwilling to participate in illegal actions. After the assassination attempt on Hitler in July 1944, she was arrested on 26 August 1944 by the Gestapo as part of the mass arrest \\"Aktion Gitter\\" and was taken into \\"protective custody\\" in Essen. At the end of September 1944, she was transferred to the Ravensbrück concentration camp. While in transit there, Zinke was able to smuggle out a last note to her husband. Almost unreadable, it says: \\"Hopefully I have the strength to endure it all.\\" („Hoffentlich habe ich die Kraft, das alles auszuhalten.“) Zinke was murdered on 6 November 1944.Martin Schumacher (Hrsg.): M.d.R.

Career  Erulkar worked in the British film industry for almost forty years (1944-1983), producing over 80 films. She won two prizes at the Venice Film Festival (1952, 1971), while her documentary about the design of postage stamps, Picture to Post (1969), won her her first Best Short Film BAFTA in 1970. Her second would come with The Living City (1977), about her native Kolkata. Erulkar began her career at the Shell Film Unit, where she had a rapid rise, graduating from scripting and editing Aircraft Today and Tomorrow (1946), to directing the second film she worked on, Flight for Tomorrow (1947). Next she directed Lord Siva Danced (1947), which featured celebrated Indian dancer and choreographer Ram Gopal, and was well received in both India and Britain. Erulkar was forced to leave Shell in 1952 after marrying fellow SFU filmmaker, Peter de Normanville. She would work as a free-lancer for the rest of her long career, first, as an editor at the National Coal Board Film Unit before resuming directing for numerous sponsors, including the British Productivity Council, the Central Office of Information (COI), the Gas Council and the General Post Office (GPO). Erulker chose not to transition into either television or feature films. Her films covered a breadth of subject matter, including 'women's issues,' and crossed genres: 'from classic documentary, travelogue, and 'trigger' films to children's features, medical training films and public information, as well as the customary swathe of promotional shorts for various commercial bodies.' Like her British documentary forbears, Erulkar brought a social consciousness to her films.  Personal Life  Erulkar was born in Kolkata, India. Her family moved to London, England in 1928. She studied sociology at Bedford College. Erulkar was married to science filmmaker Peter de Normanville.

According to oral tradition, she ruled for about seven years in the 14th or 15th century, encouraging the women and oppressing the men, especially the bald, old and short ones. Her reign ended when the men tricked her into a ride upon a wild steed, which tore her apart. Places in Sidama are still named after her body parts, which were scattered in this last ride. Early life There are no written records from that time so her history is based upon oral tradition. According to this, she was born around the fourteenth or fifteenth century in Sidama. She was of the Sidama people but there is no agreement on her clan. It has been suggested that she may have been from Hawella Gadire, Yanassie, Kusaye or Sawolla. She was the first child of a first wife and this gave her status and privilege. Some accounts say that she married a powerful chief, Dingama Koyya, who was known for his great power, erecting stone stelae and statues which still exist today. Their son was powerful too and the people so feared them that both father and son were killed. Furra then took power as queen. Other accounts say that she had a daughter, Laango. Reign She presided over a matriarchal administration and was styled the \\"Queen of the Women\\" (mentu biilo) rather than \\"Queen of Sidama\\" due to her partisanship for women. She was considered wise and advised women against submitting to men. She also counselled women to keep men guessing, and cover their private parts as well as taking care of their beauty. After observing male cowardice in battle, she relegated the men to menial duties while organising the women to do the fighting. She set them impossible tasks, such as gathering water with a sieve. She purged the men, especially executing those who were bald, old or short. Old men were selected because elders are respected in Sidama society and so might oppose her effectively. One old wise man asked the other men for help and he was hidden in a riverside cave or well where he became their secret advisor. When the queen demanded a castle in the air, the wise old man told the men that they should ask her to lay the foundations. She had to do this on the ground and so a conventional house could then be built. She ruled for about seven years, continuing to oppress the men. She finally demanded a fast steed to carry her throughout the realm and into battle. The hidden old man advised the other men to capture a wild animal, like a giraffe, and then tie her to it. This was done and then the powerful animal tore her apart as it galloped off. According to legend, her body parts fell in different places which are now named after them: Anga (hand), Leka (leg), and Oun (head) :Her shoulders dropped in Qorke, :Her waist dropped in Hallo :Her limbs dropped in Dassie :Her genitals dropped in Saala :Her remains dropped in Kuura In these places, the men still beat the ground in disgust while the women pour milk in homage. Legacy She remains a popular legend in the oral culture of the Sidama people and her story continues to be told. Each sex has its own song about her. The men sing in outrage :During Furra's reign :Men ground and cooked for women :Let her die, let her die! while the women sing in sympathy :Sleep, sleep my children :Sleep, sleep my children :You're my best child :For they killed the best :Furra, you're the leader of woman! The Sidama Cultural Centre in Awasa, which was built in 1984, has a mural of Queen Fura. A college founded in 1996 in Irgalem was named Fura after the queen but its accreditation was suspended in 2011. In 2016, Teshome Birhanu published a book in that celebrates her as a visionary monarch. Author and traveler Elizabeth Laird collected the Fura legend from storyteller Abebe Kebede at Lake Awassa, as she recounts in her book The Lure of the Honey Bird: the storytellers of Ethiopia. She compares Fura with Queen Gudit.

Wednesday, December 06, 1905; Page: 6 However, the trust donated the entire site to Douglas Corporation which then redeveloped the site as an entertainment venue. Upon completion the venue was opened by the Lieutenant Governor, Lord Raglan, on 19 July 1913. The original name of the venue was the Villa Marina Kursaal. In part this was seen as an attempt by the Corporation to address the town's perceived lack of sophistication and to raise the town's profile to visitors. The Germanic term for the venue was dropped at the outbreak of World War I and the venue was renamed the Royal Hall. For several summer seasons in the 1950s the Villa Marina was home to Joe Loss and his orchestra. Other stars performing at that time included Ivy Benson and various international cabaret artistes. During the summer months the Villa gardens would also be the venue for numerous beauty pageants. Restoration By the year 2000, the Villa Marina had become a burden to its owner, Douglas Corporation, and was in need of considerable renovation. Just as had been the case with the nearby Gaiety Theatre 30 years previously, the large financial commitment needed to restore the venue to an acceptable standard was seen as unaffordable, and so ownership of the Villa Marina was transferred from Douglas Borough Council to the Isle of Man Government in March 2000. Various alterations were made starting in 2001, with local architect Ian Brown commissioned to undertake the work. The work included the reorientation of the main entrance from facing the promenade to facing the gardens. A cinema and Promenade Suite were created, and a profile of the benefactor of the land, Henry Bloom Noble, was placed above the entrance. A view of the Villa Marina Arcade, Douglas Isle of Man.

Often called Bolivia's most recognizable chola, Canaviri changed the face of Bolivian television, when she began broadcasting her cooking show by introducing for the first time an indigenous woman as the main presence. In 2014, she was honored as one of the BBC's 100 Women Series.  Early life Justa Elena Canaviri Choque was born on 13 August 1963 in La Paz, Bolivia to Filomena Choque and Ambrosio Canaviri. The second of four daughters in the family, Canaviri studied at the Tecnimod Academy with a focus on sewing and design, social work and took additional training in Bolivian gastronomy, studying the national food and pastries. She raised three children, Indira, Addis and José, working as a house cleaner to support them. Career In 1999, Canaviri met the Bolivian screenwriter Guillermo Aguirre, who thought that she could work in television. He helped her secure work as a presenter on a television program, \\"La Cancha\\", which introduced products to consumers. After that show ended, she worked as a host on two short-lived programs, \\"Sábado Estelar\\" and \\"Fiebre de Sábado con la Canasta de La Justa\\". Because she could not find additional television work and she liked working in the medium, she wrote a program called \\"La Wislla de La Justa\\" and began pitching it to various independent producers. ' (RTP Bolivia), agreed to produce the show in 2002. Canaviri's program centered on food, but with Canaviri discussing political and social issues, as well as presenting cultural traditions. Within three months the program had become a hit and she began to think of producing it independently. After ten months, she went to work at the ' and the program was renamed \\"La Justa\\", where she remained for the next three years. Canaviri was a trendsetter. Before she went on the air, television in Bolivia was dominated by those of European ancestry. Proud of her heritage, Canaviri wanted her program to depict who she really was. She wore her hair in braids, topped with the bowler hat typically worn by cholas, and the traditional multi-pleated polleras. In 2006, Canaviri moved her show to Bolivia TV. where she continued to present lively conversation and recipes. In 2013, when she felt that Bolivia TV wanted a younger image and was trying to censor her discussions, Canaviri expanded her options and began airing her program on Virgen de Copacabana TV in El Alto, becoming the first presenter to air a program on two separate channels. Canaviri broke the concepts of beauty and stereotypes associated with indigenous women, becoming \\"the most famous chef on Bolivian television\\". She discussed such topics as weight, violence against women and abuse, discrimination against indigenous people and their rights, and LGBT issues in Bolivia. In 2014, she was honored by the BBC as one of the most inspirational 100 Women of the year. That same year, she was selected by Kimberly-Clark Bolivia as one of the women models in their golden years who would represent their Poise brand of products. She has become one of the most influential women in Bolivia and has participated as a chef and in workshops for women in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Panama, Peru and the United States.

Early life and education  Mander was born in Kingston upon Hull, the only child of Thomas Hope Mander, an accountant and bookkeeper, and Mable Fanny (nee Jacob). Mander lived in Kingston-upon-Hull for seven years.http://historyproject.org.uk/interview/kay-mander Interview She spent her childhood, when not boarding at Queenwood Ladies' College in Eastbourne, in France and Germany due to her father's work for an American radiator company, National Radiators, taking him to Europe. It was in Paris she showed an interest in photography. She moved to Berlin to join her parents after failing an Oxford Scholarship exam. She considered several professions including teaching, journalism and acting, even joining an ex-pat amateur dramatics club.  Career  In 1935, Mander worked as a secretary at Joseph Goebbels's International Film Congress. There she met several delegates of the British feature film industry who encouraged her to look for employment in the British film industry. She contacted them for a job when she returned to Britain. Her first job in the film industry was as an interpreter for German cameraman Hans Schneeberger. Schneeberger was in London working on the aviation docudrama Conquest of the Air (1936) for producer Alexander Korda, of London Films. She then spent several years working in traditionally \\"female\\" departments such as publicity, budget and production before moving into continuity. In 1940, she was offered a job at Shell Film Unit making instructional films by producer Arthur Elton. Her debut film as a director was How to File (1941), intended as a training tool for the aircraft construction industry. Mander was praised for her innovative use of tracking shots following the movement of the file. Mander directed four more instructional films for Shell Film Unit, two for the recently restructured Fire Service and another for the Ministry of Home Security. These films were highly complex and technical and made for specialised audiences but were characterised by clarity, simplicity and skilful technical exposition. Mander went on to direct up to fifty instructional and promotional films in the UK and overseas. One of her best known films is Homes for the People (1945) which used the technique of allowing working class women to describe their living conditions, one of them vividly slating the design of her suburban house and summing up: \\"I call it a muck-up\\". In the 1950s, Mander and her husband, fellow filmmaker Rod Neilson Baxter, returned from Indonesia where they had helped set up a film unit. After directing a feature film for the Children's Film Foundation, The Kid from Canada (1957), Mander returned to continuity work, later saying that \\"I palpably had the skills\\" but could not face \\"battling\\" to continue directing. She spent most of the rest of her career working in continuity on feature films, including From Russia with Love, The Heroes of Telemark and Fahrenheit 451. Kay Mander went to live in Kirkcudbrightshire and died in Castle Douglas, Scotland on 29 December 2013. She is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull.  Politics  During the 1930s, Mander joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and attended Left Book Club meetings. Her political leanings would later influence her filmmaking. In 1937, she was the first woman to join the film industry's union, the Association of Cinematographic Technicians (ACT) (now BECTU). She had a column in the ACT journal, The Cine-Technician, until the 1950s, where she wrote union issues such as the need for equal pay and post-war job security. After the end of World War II, her membership of the CPGB made it more difficult for her to find work.

Ludvig Ferdinand Römer established a sugar refinery in the building in 1754. He had been governor of the Danish Gold Coast. His wife was Anna Cathrine Widderkamp and the couple had 14 children. The property was expanded with two extra storeys in 1835-1836 for a grocer named Harboe. The actor Christian Niemann Rosenkildelived in the building with his family from 1842 to 1749.

With a friend, she was one of the first women to explore the devastated battlefields after the Armistice. She left a memoir of her experiences. Early life and academic career Christina Keith was born in Thurso on 12 January 1889, the eldest child of Peter Keith and Katie Bruce. One of her brothers was the artist David Barrogill Keith (1891-1979). She showed early academic promise and was dux of Miller Institute in Thurso at the age of 14. She attended St Leonards School in St Andrews and then Miss Williamson’s School in Edinburgh. Her parents supported her desire for higher education although this was still unusual for women. Even more unusual was her decision to study the traditionally male subject of Classics at Edinburgh University despite not even knowing the Greek alphabet. She graduated in 1910 with First Class Honours in Latin, Greek and classical archaeology. Of the ten others in her class, nine were men. Christina then spent three years studying at Newnham College, Cambridge, and was placed in the First Class in both parts of the Classical Tripos. As a woman, she was allowed to sit the exams and was awarded a grade but was not permitted to graduate with a degree. She was then appointed lecturer in Classics at Armstrong College, Newcastle, taking up her post in October 1914. First World War Sir Henry Hadow, Principal of Armstrong College, was appointed Director of Education for the army’s new education scheme, run by the YMCA, in July 1918. Soon afterwards Christina took up a post as staff lecturer, based in Dieppe, France. She taught English, languages and other subjects to soldiers who were ‘behind the lines’, and was living among the troops when the Armistice was declared. Her memoir ‘A Fool in France’, published in full in 'War Classics: the remarkable memoir of Scottish scholar Christina Keith on the Western Front', paints a vivid picture her life and work among soldiers of all social backgrounds. Given a few days’ leave, she and a female companion were among the first women to travel across devastated battlefields still littered with the debris of war once the guns had fallen silent. Later career and publications The education scheme was disbanded in spring 1919, and Christina returned to England and took up a new position as Senior Classics Tutor in St Hilda’s College, Oxford. She remained there for the rest of her academic life, and also taught inmates in Oxford prison. In 1942 Christina left Oxford and returned to Thurso, where she focussed on the study of Scottish literature and history. She wrote many newspaper articles and published 'The Russet Coat', a study of the works of Robert Burns, and 'The Romance of Barrogill Castle', a history of the castle now known as the Castle of Mey. Her final book, a biography of Walter Scott titled 'The Author of Waverley' was published posthumously. She died in 1963. The Christina Keith prize was established in the same year.

Career Her exhibitions include Rosengarten, a collaboration with writer Janice Galloway at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow in 2004. This exhibition was inspired by research into obstetric instruments and the mechanics of childbirth. It featured nine light tables with sculptural pieces in bronze, plaster and fabric, and poems and text by Janice Galloway. A review featured in The List at the time of the exhibition in 2004 said: “Bevan engages with the obstetric forms but you also feel an infinity lies within the materials she uses, a sense of investment, which is echoed in Galloway’s text. The two elements are essential to one another. The text subtly lifts you out of the materiality of the sculptures, enhancing your emotional engagement with the work, whilst the scale and form of the objects creates a bodily reaction that borders on the physically uncomfortable.“ Bevan often looks at themes such as the environment, in particular water and the sea. In 2012, she was one of 100 artists who co-signed an open letter to Creative Scotland, critical of the organisation, and making a number of requests, including the removal of jargon from official communications and the inclusion of those with artform experience to funding applications.

His scholarly work focused largely on issues relating to the American West. His book The Day of the Cattleman, a regional study of cattlemen in Montana and Wyoming in the mid-nineteenth century, was his most critically acclaimed work. It focuses on the cattlemen's utilization of the semi-arid Great Plains region as well as their roles in railroad building and building an economic foundation for the American West.Oliphant, J. Orin. \\"Book Review: The Day of the Cattleman\\". The Washington Historical Quarterly 21.3 (July 1930) https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/WHQ/article/view/7804 His work on The Day of the Cattleman along with a number of subsequent articles in the journals Minnesota History and Agricultural History were enough to earn him a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1936. This fellowship was to support a book on Montana history which never materialized. Along with his own scholarship, Dr. Osgood was an active participant in the historical conversation by writing numerous book reviews of works on the American West well into his retirement in the 1960s, most notably reviewing Walter Prescott Webb's seminal work The Great Plains in 1932.Osgood, Ernest S. \\"Book Review: The Great Plains.\\" Minnesota History 13.1 (1932): 92-94. Dr. Osgood's second book happened almost by accident. In 1953, a former student of his, Lucile M. Kane, who had gone on to work at the Minnesota Historical Society called him up. She had just left the St. Paul, Minnesota home of the granddaughter of John Henry Hammond, a general during the Civil War on the staff of William Tecumseh Sherman and, later, an inspector for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Kane told Dr. Osgood that in the papers of General Hammond, she had found a bundle wrapped in an 1805 copy of the Washington, D.C. National Intelligencer. Within that bundle were the unmistakable field notes of Captain William Clark, from the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition. After a prolonged federal legal battle over ownership of the papers involving Hammond's descendants, the Minnesota Historical Society, Yale University, and the National Archives and Records Administration, the papers ended up in the Western Americana Collection at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library where Osgood was able to finish editing the collection.Cutright, Paul Russell. A History of the Lewis and Clark Journals. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000. It was published as The Field Notes of Captain William Clark, 1803–1805 by Yale University Press in 1964. Retirement and Death After 30 years at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Osgood retired to Wooster, Ohio where he occasionally lectured at the College of Wooster and continued to write. He spent his summers in Montana with his wife on Alice Creek in the western part of that state, near Lewis and Clark Pass (Montana), until his death in 1983. His love of the West never abated; in an article published near the end of his life in the Western Historical Quarterly of the Western History Association entitled \\"I Discover Western History\\", Osgood wrote \\"As I drive westward, the words of the prophet Isaiah come to me, 'For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands'.\\"Osgood, Ernest Staples. \\"I Discover Western History\\" The Western Historical Quarterly 3.3 (1972): 241-251.

She was imprisoned by the Gestapo and put to death at Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1945.  Early life  Young was born on 5 June 1883 in Aberdeen to Elizabeth Ann Burnett (1854–1884) and Alexander Young (1855–1913), a clerk. Her mother died while she was a baby, after which she moved with her family, her father and two elder sisters, to Edinburgh. After school, she worked as a dressmaker at Jenners department store. She left Edinburgh in 1904 to go to Surrey to train as a nurse, gaining state registration in 1908. In 1909 she travelled to Paris, France to work as a private nurse.  World War I  At the outbreak of World War I Young volunteered for service with the British Red Cross, working in the British Army zone in France, nursing wounded troops on the Western Front. Young's fiancé was killed in World War I. After the war, she returned to private nursing in Paris travelling occasionally to Scotland to visit her sister Annie Sutherland in Aberdeen and her aunt in Ballater.  World War II and imprisonment  When the Nazis occupied Paris in June 1940 Young chose to remain in the city and continue her nursing work. In December of that year, she was sent to an internment camp for allied civilians near Besançon and released after about six months as result of poor health, from where she returned to Paris. Despite being under surveillance by the Gestapo she received, into her home at 69 Rue Laugier, people sent from Britain who were assisting with the French Resistance. Her apartment was also used as a base for sending and receiving covert radio transmissions from London. On 11 November 1943 she was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo on suspicion of helping British servicemen escape. In February 1944 she was sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp for women, as a political prisoner. News of her death did not reach Scotland until September 1945.  Post-war  After the war, investigations by the British Embassy in Paris and United Nations War Crimes Commission proved that Young had been put to death by the Germans by being \\"put in a gas chamber or otherwise\\" sometime between February and March 1945. Her sister and sole next-of-kin, Elizabeth Ann Sutherland, raised a legal action to settle Young's estate. On 30 January 1948 at the Court of Session, Lord Blade issued a judgement that presumed Young's death had occurred on 14 March 1945. Evidence given at the trial included letters that spoke to her courage and cheerfulness. The French novelist, , who was also an inmate at Ravensbrück, said of her, \\"She always kept her chin up … and all of us liked the little Scotswoman, Mees Young\\". Young has been compared to nurse Edith Cavell who was executed by firing squad by the Germans in World War I.

As of 2016 she was living in Jabalia Camp a Palestinian refugee camp located north of Jabalia, where she volunteers at a local orphanage, teaches the Quran, and cycles with a local group of women. Role in women's cycling In the region where Amna Suleiman cycles, the Gaza strip, the custom is for women to not ride their bike past the age of puberty. Suleiman began cycling in 2015 for health reasons and to remind herself of better times in her childhood. Soon after, she established what is considered to be the first women's cycling club riding under the Hamas party's administration in Gaza. Women's participation in sports has been restricted in the Gaza strip since the Hamas party came to power. According to Ahmad Muheisin, an official in Gaza’s youth and sports ministry office, women's cycling is considered to be a “violation” of Gazan values. Some have noted that it was more common for women to ride bikes in Gaza before the mid-1980s. Suleiman advocates for women to continue riding bicycles after puberty, and has been quoted in The New York Times telling young women in Gaza that they should insist to their future husbands permission to cycle be a condition of their marriage. In 2016 she was profiled by BBC News as part of their BBC 100 Women series. She says she hopes that one day women will be able ride a bicycle without stigma and disapproval.
