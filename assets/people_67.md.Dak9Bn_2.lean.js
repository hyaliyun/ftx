History Viikin kampuksen historia alkaa keskiajalta . University of Helsinki. Retrieved 8-8-2008.  Viikki area was a relatively wealthy agricultural village already in the Middle Ages. In conjunction of the founding of the City of Helsinki in 1555, the village of Viikki was formed as a crown storage manor () responsible for supplying the Vantaankoski Crown Manor, a local administrative center, with crops and fodder. While the crown manor at Vantaankoski was destroyed already in 1571 by Russians, the Viikki storage manor remained in state ownership. Subsequently it served a residence of different officers and the provincial governors. The manor was allocated in 1931 to the University of Helsinki for use as an experimental and teaching farm. However, the University took the area in to its actual use only in 1946, after the Second World War. At this time, the area was clearly countryside outside the city. In 1960s, the Departments of Agriculture, Food Sciences, Domestic Sciences and Environmental Sciences received new buildings in the area, and student dormitories were also built for the students of the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry. The campus was built into its present size from the year 1993 onwards. Then, a decision was made to concentrate the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry and all life sciences to the Viikki Campus, resulting in major construction activities. All departments of Forestry moved into the campus area in 2002, and the Departments, later Faculties of Biosciences and Pharmacy moved in Biocenter building complex at the same time. As part of the centralization of Helsinki bioscience activities, the Finnish Food Safety Authority moved into the area in 2006.

It extends for in a generally northwest–southeast direction, connecting the former Griffiss Air Force Base to the Utica–Rome Expressway (NY 49) and downtown Rome. The highway's southern terminus is at an interchange with NY 49 east of downtown Rome, and its northern terminus is at an intersection with NY 46 just north of downtown. NY 825 was assigned in 2002 and is ceremoniously named the Griffiss Veterans' Memorial Parkway. Route description NY 825 begins at a trumpet interchange with the Utica–Rome Expressway (NY 49) east of downtown Rome. The route heads northward, crossing over NY 365 about from NY 49\\\\. No direct connection exists between NY 365 and NY 825; however, Shady Grove Trail, a local street located just south of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park limits, provides access between the two roads. The highway continues north into the park, where it serves as the primary north–south roadway through the area. Roughly north of NY 49, NY 825 meets Geiger and Ellsworth Roads at a roundabout and continues northward toward Griffiss International Airport. NY 825 at the at-grade rail crossing near Hangar Road in 2015, now continues as four-lane Then at another roundabout it meets Hangar Road, a local street providing direct access to the airport, NY 825 turns to the northwest, following Mohawk Drive toward the western extent of the former Griffiss Air Force Base grounds. The road comes to a junction with Bell Road, the last street that NY 825 meets within the business park. Past Bell Road, the route curves the northwest and exits the park as it crosses over the Mohawk River and enters a more densely developed area of Rome. NY 825, now named East Chestnut Street, continues onward for three blocks into a commercialized area north of downtown Rome, where it ends at a junction with Black River Boulevard (NY 46). All of NY 825 is maintained by the city of Rome. History Construction on the four-lane roadway that became NY 825 began on November 20, 2001, with a groundbreaking ceremony. The southernmost of the $8.5 million highway was completed by the following October, at which time the roadway was signed as NY 825. By 2004, the route was extended northward along two-lane surface streets to intersect NY 46 north of downtown Rome. Long-term plans for the route called for the two-lane segments of NY 825 to be widened to four lanes. The section of NY 825 from Bell Road to NY 46 was widened by February 2009, leaving just the of the route from the roundabout with Geiger and Ellsworth Roads northwest to Bell Road to be expanded. On July 3, 2007, all of NY 825 was officially designated the Griffiss Veterans' Memorial Parkway after legislation proposing the name was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer. Signage displaying the ceremonial name was unveiled as part of a dedication ceremony held on November 14, 2007. NY 825 northbound in Griffiss In February 2009, the Griffiss Local Development Corporation (GLDC) hired an engineering firm to complete the design work needed to begin work on widening the final two-lane section of NY 825 to four lanes. The company hoped that completing the project's design would make the project eligible for federal stimulus funding. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYS DOT) had completed 40% of the necessary design work; however, it lacked the funds needed to complete the plans and build the highway. As a result, GLDC saw hiring an outside firm to finish the project layout and receive federal stimulus funding as the most feasible way to make the project a reality. The remaining design work was estimated to cost between $400,000 and $500,000 while the actual construction cost was set at approximately $7 million. In April 2015, $10.5M was included in the NYS DOT budget to renovate the parkway's final one-mile long, two-lane section into four lanes. GLDC hired an engineering firm to update the 2009 design plans. The project plan includes two roundabouts, one at the Floyd Avenue and Brooks Road intersection and one at the Hangar Road intersection. The budget also includes funding to construct a multi-use recreational trail and tie it into the Mohawk River/Erie Canal Trail System. An $8.85M contract was awarded and construction began in August 2016 with completion scheduled for October 2018. On November 7, 2017, the newly built section of the parkway was opened to traffic although work is continuing on final paving, lighting, and rip out of the old alignment to allow for construction of the adjacent recreational trail.

When Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I (r. c. 1344–1322 BC) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates.The ‘Eternal Treaty’ from the Hittite perspective pp.3-4 by Trevor Bryce When Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit.Manfred Dietrich, \\"Salmanassar I. von Assyrien, Ibirānu (VI.) von Ugarit und Tudḫalija IV. von Hatti\\", Ugarit-Forschungen 35 (2003) 103-139.

As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region. Outcome The conflict between the two great powers took place in the neighborhood of Nihriya, with the Assyrians gaining a decisive victory. The Assyrian victory shook the Hittite state to its foundations as its king Tudhaliya IV faced several internal revolts against his reign. Tudhaliya IV would ultimately overcome all these challenges to his authority and retain the kingship of Hatti.

It was granted by King John I of Castile. The city lies along the road of El Camino de Santiago de Madrid.  Origins  The oldest traces of Rioseco come from the Iron Age and the time of Celtic Iberia. Some ancient authors mistakenly identified this area as a Forum Egurrorum or a market square, in the Visigoths' era. Documents relating to the Tierra de Campos and Campos Gothic or Campii Gotorum date from this period. In the middle of the ninth century and throughout the tenth century, this area was a territory of colonization of the Asturian-Leonese kingdom, which also contained Mozarabic people, such as the Iberian Christians who lived under Arab Islamic rule in Al-Andalus. This perhaps led to a place name for the population: \\"Medina\\" (Arabic for \\"city\\").  Reconquest  Map showing the Iberian Peninsula in AD 1000, with Condado de Castilla still a part of the Kingdom of León. The confluence of the borders between the Kingdom of León and County of Castile led to battles in this area between the two kingdoms. In 1037, Castile became the separate Kingdom of Castile. Alfonso X the Wise determined the ultimate limits with Valladolid in 1258, leaving Medina for the mountains of Torozos. During the Middle Ages, in the Merindad of Valladolid Infantazgo (in old Castilian cited as: the Infantadgo of Ualladolid Meryndat), there was an administrative division of the Kingdom of Castile, which is described in the book Calif of Behetrías of Castile,quanta IBRO what are the rights of the sites of meryndades of (Carrion) and of CANPOS e Monçon of the Infantadgo of Ualladolid and Cerrato, the quale rights were known by research that fizieron by letter and command of our Sennor Gonçalo King Pedro Martinez de Penna Faithful and Lorenci Martinez, cleric of Penna Faithful ...

Admirals of Castile  In May 1405 Don Alonso Enriquez (1354–1429) received the title of Admiral of Castile from King Henry III of Castile, after the death of the previous owner of this title, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. In 1423 John II of Castile established the manor of Medina Rioseco. Its traditional commercial role since medieval times gained official status over time. Exercising dominion, D. Fadrique Enriquez, second admiral, was granted by John II the privilege of conducting an annual fair. Under the dominion of Alfonso II Enriquez, third Admiral of Castile, Enrique IV of Castile granted the town the right to conduct a second annual fair, and in 1465, Henry IV gave it a free weekly tax. Don Frederic II and Enríquez de Cabrera—the fourth Admiral—began building the palace of the admirals and the church of San Francisco. He also founded the convent of Santa Clara, and during his rule built the church of Santa María de Mediavilla.  16th century  Medina de Rioseco became the global trading hub for silver arriving from the Indies through the port of Seville and enjoyed an economic boom that reached its peak during the 16th century. Donations and legacies poured in from the Americas, greatly increasing the wealth of the city and surrounding parishes. Four large Riosecano churches were built, and the city became home to one of the most important fairs of the kingdom, second only to that at Medina del Campo. At this time the, so-called Penitential Monasteries were founded, which were famous for their processions of penance and passion, and their many chapels and hospitals. The Battle of Medina del Rioseco took place on July 14, 1808, during the Peninsular War.

The route's concurrency with U.S. Route 54 (US-54) is a part of the National Highway System. Route description K-3 begins at an intersection with K-47 west of Girard in Crawford County and heads north on a two-lane road through plains. Approximately north of its southern terminus, the route passes through the small community of Brazilton. North of here, the highway curves to the west, intersects the eastern terminus of K-146, and turns back to the north. K-3 crosses a branch of the Walnut Creek and continues north and cuts through Hepler. The route then enters Bourbon County. North of the county line, K-3 turns east and begins a concurrency with K-39. Shortly after, the highway leaves K-39 and turns to the north, continuing in that direction for about before bending to the northwest. K-3 then curves to the north and crosses the Marmaton River. Continuing north of the river, the highway twists to the northeast and passes through Uniontown. Just north of Uniontown, K-3 enters a concurrency with U.S. Route 54 (US-54) and turns west. The highways curve to the northwest, running through slightly wooded flat lands. K-3 leaves the concurrency with US-54 just east of the city of Bronson and turns north. About north of the concurrency, K-3 serves as the eastern terminus of K-65. After this intersection, the highway crosses the Little Osage River, then enters Linn County. North of here, K-3 meets its northern terminus at an intersection with K-31 east of Blue Mound. K-3 is maintained by KDOT. In 2012, the traffic on the route, measured in annual average daily traffic, was found to be between 130 and 2060 vehicles per day. Most of the traffic was present on the concurrency with US-54. K-3's concurrency with US-54 is included in the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History K-3 was designated in 1927. At that time, the route was almost completely gravel; only the concurrency with US-54 was paved. By 1950, the portion of K-3 in Crawford County had been paved. The portion of the route from the Crawford-Bourbon county line to the west end of the concurrency with K-39 was paved in 1953, and the remainder of the road was paved by 1958.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 5 in the city of Syracuse to a junction with NY 298 in the adjacent town of Salina. The route intersects Interstate 690 (I-690) near its southern terminus and passes through Syracuse's Eastwood neighborhood near its midpoint, where it meets NY 290\\\\. NY 598 was assigned . The northernmost portion of the route replaced NY 930M, a short unsigned reference route that extended from NY 298 in Salina southeast to the Syracuse city line at North Midler Avenue. NY 930M itself was a remnant of New York State Route 433, a highway assigned in the early 1950s and removed in the mid-1960s that, upon removal, followed the same alignment as modern NY 598\\\\. Route description Southbound on NY 598 at the intersection of South Midler Avenue and Sunnycrest Road in Syracuse NY 598 begins at an intersection with NY 5 (Erie Boulevard) east of downtown Syracuse. The route heads north as the four-lane South Midler Avenue, crossing a CSX Transportation-owned railroad spur known as the Peat Street Runner at-grade ahead of an interchange with I-690 (exit 15) at the southern edge of the Eastwood neighborhood. North of I-690, the route narrows to two lanes as it travels through the densely populated residential neighborhood. The homes cease temporarily around NY 598's intersection with NY 290 (James Street), a prominent retail corridor in eastern Syracuse. Upon crossing NY 290, NY 598 becomes North Midler Avenue as it becomes surrounded by houses once more. At the Syracuse city line three blocks to the north, North Midler Avenue splits off to the northeast while NY 598 becomes New Court Avenue. The switch in both the town of DeWitt and name also brings about a switch in surroundings as the route heads northwest into a heavily industrial area built up along CSX's Mohawk Subdivision rail line. NY 598 ends shortly afterward at an intersection with NY 298 just inside the Salina town line. The portion of NY 598 in DeWitt and Salina is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); the remainder of the route is maintained by the city of Syracuse. History All of Midler Avenue, including the portion of the street not currently part of NY 598 in DeWitt, was originally designated as NY 433 in the early 1950s. At the time, NY 433 ended at the junction of Midler Avenue and Court Street Road (then NY 298). By 1954, New Court Avenue, an east–west connector between NY 298 and NY 433 in DeWitt, was designated as NY 436. In the late 1950s, construction began on a bypass of Court Street that extended from the western terminus of NY 436 in Salina to the junction of NY 298 and Thompson Road (modern NY 635) in DeWitt. The bypass was opened to traffic as a realignment of NY 298 by 1961. NY 433 was then extended northeastward along NY 298's former routing on Court Street to Carrier Circle, where it met the realigned NY 298. The alignments of NY 433 and NY 436 north of the Syracuse city line were flipped , placing NY 433 on Midler Avenue and New Court Avenue and NY 436 on Midler Avenue and Court Street Road. Both designations were removed at some point in the latter half of the 1960s. The portion of NY 433's former routing outside of Syracuse became NY 930M, an unsigned reference route. NY 930M went unchanged until when it was incorporated into NY 598, a new route extending from NY 5 to NY 298 by way of NY 433's final alignment.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 70 east of the Allegany County village of Canaseraga to a junction with NY 36 in the Steuben County village of Arkport. Although NY 961F follows a mostly north–south alignment, it is inventoried as an east–west route by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Unlike most reference routes, NY 961F is signed as a touring route. The highway was part of NY 38 in the 1920s and part of NY 70 from the 1930s to the 1970s. Route description NY 961F proceeding west from its terminus, NY 36, in Arkport NY 961F begins just east of the village of Canaseraga at an intersection with NY 70 in the town of Burns. The route heads southward, crossing the Norfolk Southern Railway-owned Southern Tier Line by way of an overpass prior to curving southeastward at the base of Tildon Hill, a mountain peaking at above sea level. Over the next , the highway heads slightly southeastward, running along the western edge of an undeveloped valley formed by Tildon Hill to the west and another plateau to the east. This section of the route loosely parallels the Southern Tier Line, which runs through the marshy center of the gully. As NY 961F approaches the Allegany–Steuben County line, it bypasses the hamlet of Burns, a railside community situated to the east on Burns Road (County Route 14). The terrain surrounding the highway remains the same in the Steuben County town of Dansville, where the route takes on a slightly more easterly alignment as the valley narrows in width. It eventually comes within view of the rail line, at which point the road turns back to the southeast and follows the Southern Tier Line along the western edge of a marsh known as The Muck. During this stretch, NY 961F encounters its first pocket of development, consisting of a small handful of isolated farms and homes. The buildings give way to open fields in the town of Hornellsville, where the route encounters the Canisteo River and enters the village of Arkport about into the town. NY 961F turns east at the river, becoming West Avenue as it crosses the Southern Tier Line at-grade and runs past closely spaced homes on both sides of the road. The route soon reaches the village center, where it ends at a junction with NY 36. History What is now NY 961F was state-maintained as early as 1920, by which time the highway had been designated as a spur of Route 15, an unsigned legislative route extending from Hornell to Scottsville. The spur route was eliminated on March 1, 1921. In the mid-1920s, the former spur became part of NY 38, an east–west highway extending from Angelica to Penn Yan via Canaseraga and Arkport. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 38 was reassigned elsewhere in the state while its former routing became part of several new routes. One of these was NY 70, which began at Whitney Crossings (now Garwoods) and passed through Canaseraga and Arkport on its way to Kanona. NY 70 was realigned in the mid-1970s to follow what had been NY 70A east from Canaseraga. Its former routing between Canaseraga and Arkport became reference route NY 961F.

The western terminus is at an intersection with Meads Hill Road in Dix. The eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 14 and NY 414 in Watkins Glen. NY 329 passes south of Watkins Glen State Park while New York State Route 419, a highway in length, connects NY 329 to the park. Both NY 329 and NY 419 pass through sparsely populated, rural areas. NY 329 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York while NY 419 was in place by 1970. NY 329 originally extended as far west as the hamlet of Townsend; however, it was cut back to its current length in the 1960s. From 1948 to 1952, NY 329 was part of the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Course, a road course around Watkins Glen State Park. Prior to the creation of the modern New York state route system in 1924, the routing of NY 329 was designated, but not signed, as part of legislative Route 46 from 1911 to 1921. Route description NY 329 through Watkins Glen =NY 329= The state- maintained NY 329 begins at an intersection with locally-maintained Meads Hill Road, Townsend Road and Whites Hollow Road in the community of Dix, New York. NY 329 progresses eastward, passing through a mix of forestry and residential homes, intersecting with Willow Drive, a local cul-de-sac, crossing a local railroad line and entering Watkins Glen State Park. There, the highway becomes further surrounded by residences, soon turning to the northeast, leaving the residential area for forestry and fields. However, as it approaches the intersection with County Route 17, NY 329 returns to the residences and intersects with NY 419 just southeast of the Watkins Glen municipal limits. After, NY 329 turns northward, paralleling NY 414 into Watkins Glen, and after a short stretch of woodlands, the route turns eastward, terminating at an intersection with NY 14 and NY 414 (Franklin Street). =NY 419= NY 419 at its northern terminus, the tollbooth entrance to Watkins Glen State Park NY 419 begins at NY 329 just southwest of the Watkins Glen village limits. It heads west along the southern edge of Watkins Glen State Park for as Walnut Road, then curves northward toward the park. The route, a mere long, comes to an end at the southern entrance to the park. History In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route 46, an unsigned legislative route that extended from Coopers Plains (northwest of Corning) in the southwest to Trumansburg in the northeast via Watkins Glen. On July 24, 1915, the state let a contract for a project to improve a portion of Route 46 in the town of Dix and the village of Watkins (now Watkins Glen) to state highway standards. This segment of Route 46, internally inventoried as State Highway 5557 (SH 5557), began at the western town line of Dix and followed Townsend Road and modern NY 329 east to Watkins, where it ended at legislative Route 12 (modern NY 14 and NY 414). The project was 13 percent complete by 1920 and completed as far west as the hamlet of Townsend by 1929. On March 1, 1921, the Route 46 designation was reassigned elsewhere in the state as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative routes. Signage along NY 329 for the former Watkins Glen Road Course When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, no designation was given to SH 5557. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, several of the routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not yet have a route number were assigned one. One of these was SH 5557, which was designated as NY 329. NY 329 was truncated to its current western terminus at Meads Hill Road in the 1960s. A connection from NY 329 to Watkins Glen State Park was designated as NY 419 by 1970. From 1948 to 1952, NY 329 was part of the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Course, a road course around Watkins Glen State Park that also included NY 409, Franklin Street (NY 14 and NY 414), and Whites Hollow Road. The first race on the road took place on October 2, 1948; the last was on September 20, 1952. During the 1952 race, a car briefly entered the crowd that had lined up along the course, killing one person and injuring several others. The race was stopped immediately and moved to another, more rural location in 1953. The entirety of the old Grand Prix road course was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 2002. The Grand Prix course is reference number 02001397.

Funds for a second prison had been allocated in 1879 to be called the \\"Branch Penitentiary\\" and to be located in Eddyville, Kentucky. The names of these two prisons were referred to in this way until the Prison Reform Bill of 1910, passed by the General Assembly, changed the mode of management of the two prisons; making one \\"reform\\" and the other \\"penal.\\" This reform bill included the changing of capital punishment from the gallows to the electric chair. Frankfort did not want the chair because of lack of room and curiosity seekers. Therefore, the Frankfort Penitentiary became known as Kentucky State Reformatory and the \\"Branch\\" was deleted from the name in Eddyville's prison and officially named Kentucky State Penitentiary.

The highway travels north from SR 26 between Royal City and Othello through farmland and east through the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge and on top of the O'Sullivan Dam over the Potholes Reservoir before ending at SR 17 northwest of Warden. A roadway to the Potholes Reservoir has appeared on maps since 1922 and a fully paved road on the current route was built by 1981. SR 262 was designated in 1991 primarily to serve Potholes State Park. Route description State Route 262 (SR 262) begins at an intersection with SR 26 between Royal City and Othello, north of the west area of the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge in rural Grant County. Passing north through farmland with center pivot irrigation on the Frenchman Hills, the highway turns east into O'Sullivan and passes Potholes State Park. The roadway continues east and forms the boundary of the Potholes Reservoir, the O'Sullivan Dam, and the northern boundary of the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge. SR 262 travels east, passing Soda Lake and Warden Lake, before travelling through the Lind Coulee and ending at an intersection with SR 17 northwest of Warden. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 480 and 1,200 vehicles per day used the highway. History A basic, unpaved road was built during the early 20th century in Lind Coulee on the current route of State Route 262 (SR 262), appearing on a 1922 United States Geological Survey map of the Othello area. After the establishment of the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge in 1944 and the completion of the O'Sullivan Dam and the Potholes Reservoir in 1949, the road was paved and connected to SR 17 after the 1964 highway renumbering. By the 1980s, a permanent road was built from SR 26 over the Frenchman Hills to the O'Sullivan Dam and onto SR 17. The highway was designated as SR 262 in 1991 and designated into law in April 1992, and has not been heavily revised since 1991.

Serving Columbia, Franklin, and Adams counties, the highway begins at U.S. Route 12 (US 12) east of Starbuck and becomes concurrent with SR 260 from Kahlotus to SR 26 in Washtucna before ending at Interstate 90 (I-90) and US 395 in Ritzville. The highway has been legislated since 1937 from Ritzville to Washtucna as Secondary State Highway 11E (SSH 11E) and in 1957 from Waschtucna to the Starbuck area as a branch of SSH 11B. The two secondary highways became SR 261 during the 1964 highway renumbering, and a gap between Washtucna and Starbuck was not paved until the construction of the Snake River Bridge was completed in 1968. Route description SR 261 begins its route at an intersection with US 12 east of the town of Starbuck in rural Columbia County. The roadway travels north over the Pataha Creek and turns west, paralleling the Tucannon River through Starbuck and to the south bank of the Snake River. The highway passes over a rail bridge owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation before turning northwest and crossing the steel cantilever Snake River Bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, into Franklin County near Lyons Ferry Park. At the north end of the bridge, SR 261 continues northwest, passing under a Union Pacific Railroad bridge and near Palouse Falls State Park, before crossing the Columbia Plateau Trail and intersecting SR 260 northeast of Kahlotus. A concurrency with SR 260 travels northeast into Adams County parallel to the Columbia Plateau Trail in the Palouse before entering Washtucna and being designated as Main Street. Main Street intersects SR 26, forming the eastern terminus of SR 260, after the Columbia Plateau Trail turns east. SR 261 continues north into farmland and crosses the John Wayne Pioneer Trail in Ralston before its northern terminus at a diamond interchange with I-90 and US 395 southeast of Ritzville, becoming Division Street as it serves the city. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 300 and 3,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly between Washtucna and Ritzville. History The Snake River Bridge at Lyons Ferry, built in 1968, carries SR 261 across the Snake River. The Mullan Road was constructed in 1862 and crossed the Snake River with a ferry crossing at Lyons Ferry until the construction of the Lower Monumental Dam downstream caused the water level to rise and longer wait times, resulting in the reconstruction of the Snake River Bridge. The current route of SR 261 from Washtucna to Ritzville was designated during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 as SSH 11E. A branch of SSH 11B was added in 1957 that extended from Washtunca to US 410, later an extension of US 12, east of Starbuck with an un-built bridge over the Snake River at Lyons Ferry. Both highways became SR 261 during the 1964 highway renumbering, but the section between Starbuck and Washtucna was not paved. The completion of the Snake River Bridge in 1968, using the dismantled steel cantilevered Vantage Bridge and listed onto the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, finished the highway.

The highway begins at the Port of Windust on the Snake River and travels east to the Lower Monumental Dam and north to SR 260 in Kahlotus, paralleling the Columbia Plateau Trail. Devils Canyon carried traffic on the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway in the early 20th century before the completion of a road serving the Lower Monumental Dam in 1961.

Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 70 and 290 vehicles per day used the highway, a decrease in previous years. History Devils Canyon was originally home to the Portland-Spokane line of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, completed in 1908 with a small tunnel near the north bank of the Snake River. The United States Army Corps of Engineers built an improved Devils Canyon Road to connect Kahlotus to a grain facility owned by the newly established Port of Kahlotus in 1961. The Lower Monumental Dam on the Snake River was completed in February 1969 and opened in May of the same year at the south end of Devils Canyon. The rail line fell into disuse by 1987 and the right-of-way was acquired by the Washington State Park System in 1991 to become the Columbia Plateau Trail. The road was designated as State Route 263 (SR 263) in 1991 and signed into law on April 1, 1992 to serve the Port of Kahlotus, now the Port of Windust, and connect to the existing SR 260 in Kahlotus.

It is the only covered bridge still in use as a public highway in Washington State. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History The bridge was built in 1905 in order to allow horse and wagon agricultural traffic to cross the river. Hans P. Ahlberg, whose dairy farm spanned both sides of the river, was instrumental in getting county commissioners to authorize the project, which was built on his property by the Ferguson & Huston company of Astoria, Oregon. The bridge was covered three years later in 1908 to preserve the expensive wooden trusses from the ravages of the area rains. The roof of the covered bridge was originally built of \\"board and batten cedar siding with a capped tin roof.\\" The bridge received a major restoration and reconstruction in 1988. In disrepair and at risk of being torn down, residents worked to raise funds for restoration. Reconstruction was completed by Dulin Construction of Centralia, Washington, for a cost of $295,980.00. The new bridge included steel beams some of which received a wood veneer to maintain the bridge's historic appearance. On September 30, 1989, the bridge was rededicated to public use, with author, granger, and Grays River resident Robert Michael Pyle serving as master of ceremonies.

Biography Born in Siena,The street where he was born, now via Giovanni Dupré in his honour. is just steps away from Piazza del Campo. Dupré began in his father's carving workshop and that of Paolo Sani, where he was occupied with producing fakes of Renaissance sculptures.Rosanna Pavoni, Reviving the Renaissance: The Use and Abuse of the Past in Nineteenth Century Italian Art and Decoration (Cambridge University Press) 1997:40. The fakes did not surface in the press until after his death: C. Boito, \\"Il cofano falsificato di Giovanni Duprè\\" Arte Italiana Decorativa e Industriale 9.3, March 1900:37f (noted by Pavoni). Cain (Hermitage Museum) In an open contest run by the Accademia di Belle Arti, he won first prize with a Judgment of Paris and made his reputation with the life-size figure of the dead Abel (illustration, right), which was purchased for Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaievna, Duchess of Leuchtenberg (now at the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg) and was replicated in bronze, c. 1839, (now in the Galleria d'arte moderna, Palazzo Pitti, Florence). The raw naturalism of the figure, greeted with shock at the time, presaged the beginning of the end of Neoclassicism in Italian sculpture and gained Dupré the encouragement of Lorenzo Bartolini. He followed this with a more classical Cain (1840, also in marble at the Hermitage Museum and in bronze at the Pitti). He followed with figures of Giotto and Saint Antonino of Florence for façade niches on the Loggiato degli Uffizi, and a bust of Pius II for the Church of San Domenico (Siena) in Siena. On a trip to Naples he passed through Rome and saw Antonio Canova's funeral monument to Pope Pius VI, which influenced his style in a classical direction. A period of ill-health was followed by renewed vigour, which resulted in the brooding and melancholy Sappho of 1857–61, with its Michelangelesque flavour (now in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome); contemporary critics acclaimed it as his best work to date. In 1851 he was called upon to provide the model for the bronze base for the grand table inlaid in pietra dura with Apollo and the Muses, executed by the Grand Ducal Opificio delle pietre dure; Duprè's figures of the Seasons with putti was cast in bronze by Clemente Papi. The table stands in the Sala del Castagnoli, Palazzo Pitti.T.C.I. Firenze e dintorni 1964:352. In 1859–64 he sculpted the funeral monument for contessa Berta Moltke Ferrari-Corbelli in the left transept of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence.T.C.I., Firenze e dintorni 1964:281. He followed it with the Putti dell'Uva (the \\"Grape Children\\"); the Madonna Addolorata for Santa Croce, Florence (1860), and the bas-relief of the Triumph of the Cross, accompanied by figures representing all the ages of Christianity, in a lunette over its main entrance. Abel, by Giovanni Dupré; (Hermitage Museum) In 1863 Dupré created his finest work, the Pietà (1860–65), for the family tomb of the marchese Bichi-Ruspoli in the cemetery of the Misericordia, Siena. This group was awarded the Grande medaille d'honneur at the International Exhibition in Paris. The San Zanobi for the façade of the Duomo di Siena, the Risen Christ for the Dupré memorial chapel, the colossal allegories of the Cavour monument in Turin (1872), the bronze bust of Savonarola set in his cell at the monastery of San Marco, Florence (1873),Touring Club Italiano, Firenze e dintorni 1964:266. and a number of minor works complete the list of Dupré's productions. His last work, the St. Francis inside the Cathedral of S. Rufino in Assisi, was finished by his eldest daughter and pupil, Amalia. Time failed him to execute the crowning figure of the Madonna for Santa Maria del Fiore. He died in Florence. At the height of his reputation he served on vetting juries for several of the international exhibitions. His memoirs, Pensieri sull'arte e ricordi autobiografici (Florence, 1879, 2nd ed. Milan 1935) were translated into English by F. Peruzzi (Edinburgh, 1886). His daughter Amalia achieved some reputation as a sculptor.

Military career Michaelis was a 1936 graduate of the United States Military Academy. In World War II, Michaelis was executive officer of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment, but took command of the unit after the commanding officer, George Van Horn Moseley Jr., broke his leg in the drop into Normandy. Later, Michaelis was severely wounded in the Netherlands. He served as chief of staff of the 101st Airborne Division during the Battle of Bastogne and ended the war as a colonel. He served as aide-de-camp to General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower from 1947 to 1948. During the Korean War, Michaelis commanded the 27th Infantry Regiment (the \\"Wolfhounds\\") at the Pusan perimeter, for which he received a Distinguished Service Cross. Early in the war, most American units were prone to breaking down and retreating. However his unit fared much better, General Matthew Ridgway believed, because of the fact that Colonel Michaelis had been an airborne commander and therefore did not panic whenever his unit was in danger of being surrounded. For as long as his unit preserved unit integrity with interlocking fields of fire, then it could handle being surrounded and cut off as they could be resupplied from the air. It was to become an important template used by Ridgway in his conduct of the Korean War once he assumed command from General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Ridgeway's policy was to become one of \\"No more retreat\\" and he sought to acquire many more commanders like Michaelis as the war continued. In fact, shortly after Ridgeway took command, he began to improve the Army's morale by sending the units north, starting with Michaelis's unit, under an offensive named Operation Wolfhound in their honor. Michaelis's unit began a new phase of the war that started a complete turnaround for U.N. troops. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1951. Michaelis described the Turkish Brigade's combat readiness in unflattering terms, according to American historian Clay Blair. Blair wrote that war correspondents were misled into thinking that the Turks were \\"tough\\" fighters by their \\"flowing mustaches, swarthy complexions, and fierce demeanors\\", while in fact Blair declared them \\"ill trained, ill led, and green to combat.\\" Blair quoted Michaelis as stating: In 1952, Michaelis returned to the United States and became commandant of cadets at the United States Military Academy. Later he commanded the Fifth Army. He was promoted to full general upon his retirement in 1972. Later life Michaelis died of heart failure on Thursday, 31 October 1985, in Clayton, Georgia. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.

According to the 2004 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 179 inhabitants. The town's residents traditionally call themselves \\"lechugeros,\\" a testament to the fact that the town had a good reputation for cultivating lettuce. Valdunquillo is adjacent to the towns La Unión de Campos, Villalogán, Bolaños de Campos, Valderas, Medina de Rioseco, and Villavicencio de los Caballeros.  History  Corner of the Plaza Doctor Bárcena Valdunquillo has been occupied by Christians, Jews, and Muslims. However, archaeological evidence shows that the area was likely first inhabited by the Vaccaei. The first written reference of the town appears in a document, dating to the year 1126, in which the Countess Doña Mayor donates to the monastery of Sahagún. In another donation, dating to the year 1192, it is referred to as \\"Valle de Junquello,\\" perhaps the origin of its present-day name. On March 5, 1368, King Enrique II ceded the town to Alvar Pérez Osorio. The Osorio family formed much of the town's history, and promoted its convent. On May 1, 1623, King Philip IV of Spain granted Francisca de Valdés Osorio the marquisate of Valdunquillo.  About the Town  The architecture of Valdunquillo consists mainly of adobe and brick with tile roofs, typical of Castile. Also typical of the area are its many palomares. The town is part of the comarca, Tierra de Campos. The area's first inhabitants were the Vaccaei, then it was occupied by the Romans, and then the Goths. It was also the border between Muslims and Christians during the Middle Ages. During the Medieval era and the Renaissance, the area was the breadbasket of Spain. As time passed, its importance declined, and people fled to large cities, like Valladolid, Sevilla, Madrid, and Barcelona.  Monuments  *Convento de la Merced: Founded in 1607, the Mercedarian convent today serves as the actual San Pedro Church. The brick building was built in the 18th century. Although its façade is somewhat austere, inside it is ornate, with gilded altars and religious works of art. *Palace of the Dukes of Alba: This small palace dates to at least the 17th century. It belonged to the Osorio family, whose family coat of arms is engraved above the main entrance. Up until now, the palace belonged to the Duchess of Alba, a descendant of the Osorio family, who is Marchioness of Valdunquillo. It has now been restored to be the home of a private owner. *San Pedro Church: From the 18th century, all that is left of the church are the ruins of its tower, popularly known as \\"The Fallen Tower.\\" *Santa María Church: Built in the 16th century, the church is now not only in ruins, but is also private property now. Its mudéjar-styled arch still stands, as well as two cupolas.

In 1998, SystemSoft spun off their video game business into SystemSoft Production. In 1999, Alpha Shock was founded, and SystemSoft invested 25.1% of the initial capital. In 2001, SystemSoft sold all investments of Alpha Shock, and they transferred the video game business from SystemSoft Production to Alpha Shock. Alpha Shock were renamed to SystemSoft Alpha, although they are independent from SystemSoft. The main website for the game division, regardless of platform, is now SystemSoft Alpha, but \\"Alpha\\" still is not seen in the logo of the company on game boxes. Only a handful of the dozens of games in their portfolio have ever been translated to make it to English-speaking markets, including two Master of Monsters games for the Sega Genesis and Sony PlayStation (\\"Disciples of Gaia\\"), and some of the Daisenryaku games (Iron Storm, Daisenryaku VII, Daisenryaku VII Exceed). Part of the reason for this is that the main platform for their games for almost a decade was the NEC PC-9801. However, several of their games were remakes of Infocom games for the PC-98 system. Since Infocom was an American company, these games were released to English-speaking markets first. SystemSoft has produced many wargames that are from the perspective of the Japanese Military, circa World War II. These games fill a niche in the hex wargaming market that Japanese Military enthusiasts cannot expect from Western game developers who often portray the Japanese as the \\"enemy\\" in games, if at all.

Description The Noleby Runestone was dated by Sophus Bugge to about 600 AD, and cannot be dated any younger than about 450 AD due to its language and rune forms. It is notable because of its inscription runo [...] raginakundo which means \\"runes of divine origin\\" and which also appears in the later Sparlösa Runestone and the eddic poem Hávamál. This is of importance for the study of Norse mythology since it indicates that the expressions and the contents of the Poetic Edda are indeed of pre-historic Scandinavian origin. The runic inscription consists of three lines of text between bands, with the second line considered untranslatable and often listed as being a \\"meaningless formula.\\" The Noleby is the only runestone in Scandinavia that uses the star rune form 12px for [j] rather than for /a/ or /h/.

GPER binds to and is activated by the female sex hormone estradiol and is responsible for some of the rapid effects that estradiol has on cells.  Discovery  The classical estrogen receptors first characterized in 1958 are water-soluble proteins located in the interior of cells that are activated by estrogenenic hormones such as estradiol and several of its metabolites such as estrone or estriol. These proteins belong to the nuclear hormone receptor class of transcription factors that regulate gene transcription. Since it takes time for genes to be transcribed into RNA and translated into protein, the effects of estrogens binding to these classical estrogen receptors is delayed. However, estrogens are also known to have effects that are too fast to be caused by regulation of gene transcription. In 2005, it was discovered that a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, GPR30 also binds with high affinity to estradiol and is responsible in part for the rapid non-genomic actions of estradiol. Based on its ability to bind estradiol, GPR30 was renamed as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). GPER is localized in the plasma membrane but is predominantly detected in the endoplasmic reticulum.  Ligands  GPER binds estradiol with high affinity though not other endogenous estrogens, such as estrone or estriol, nor other endogenous steroids, including progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol. Although potentially involved in signaling by aldosterone, GPER does not show any detectable binding towards aldosterone. Niacin and nicotinamide bind to the receptor in vitro with very low affinity. CCL18 has been identified as an endogenous antagonist of the GPER. GPER-selective ligands (that do not bind the classical estrogen receptors) include the agonist G-1 and the antagonists G15 and G36. =Agonists= * 2-Methoxyestradiol * 2,2',5'-PCB-4-OH * Afimoxifene * Aldosterone * Atrazine * Bisphenol A * Daidzein * DDT (p,p'-DDT, o',p'-DDE) * Diarylpropionitrile (DPN) * Equol * Estradiol * Ethynylestradiol * Fulvestrant (ICI-182780)) * G-1 * Genistein * GPER-L1 * GPER-L2 * Hydroxytyrosol * Kepone * Niacin * Nicotinamide * Nonylphenol * Oleuropein * Propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) * Quercetin * Raloxifene * Resveratrol * STX * Tamoxifen * Tectoridin =Antagonists= * CCL18 * Estriol * G15 * G36 * MIBE =Unknown= * Diethylstilbestrol * Zearalenone =Non-ligand= * 17α-Estradiol * Estrone  Function  This protein is a member of the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors and is a multi-pass membrane protein that localizes to the plasma membrane. The protein binds estradiol, resulting in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate in the nucleus. This protein therefore plays a role in the rapid nongenomic signaling events widely observed following stimulation of cells and tissues with estradiol. The distribution of GPER is well established in the rodent, with high expression observed in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenal medulla, kidney medulla and developing follicles of the ovary.  Animal studies  = Reproductive tissue = Estradiol produces cell proliferation in both normal and malignant breast epithelial tissue. However, GPER knockout mice show no overt mammary phenotype, unlike ERα knockout mice, but similarly to ERβ knockout mice. This indicates that although GPER and ERβ play a modulatory role in breast development, ERα is the main receptor responsible for estrogen-mediated breast tissue growth. GPER is expressed in germ cells and has been found to be essential for male fertility, specifically, in spermatogenesis. GPER has been found to modulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. = Cardiovascular effects = GPER is expressed in the blood vessel endothelium and is responsible for vasodilation and as a result, blood pressure lowering effects of 17β-estradiol. GPER also regulates components of the renin–angiotensin system, which also controls blood pressure, and is required for superoxide-mediated cardiovascular function and aging. = Central nervous system activity = GPER and ERα, but not ERβ, have been found to mediate the antidepressant-like effects of estradiol. Contrarily, activation of GPER has been found to be anxiogenic in mice, while activation of ERβ has been found to be anxiolytic. There is a high expression of GPER, as well as ERβ, in oxytocin neurons in various parts of the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus. It is speculated that activation of GPER may be the mechanism by which estradiol mediates rapid effects on the oxytocin system, for instance, rapidly increasing oxytocin receptor expression. Estradiol has also been found to increase oxytocin levels and release in the medial preoptic area and medial basal hypothalamus, actions that may be mediated by activation of GPER and/or ERβ. Estradiol, as well as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, have been found to rapidly induce lordosis through activation of GPER in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus of female rats. = Metabolic roles = Female GPER knockout mice display hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance, reduced body growth, and increased blood pressure. Male GPER knockout mice are observed to have increased growth, body fat, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, increased osteoblast function (mineralization), resulting in higher bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume, and persistent growth plate activity resulting in longer bones. The GPER-selective agonist G-1 shows therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of obesity and diabetes.  Role in cancer  Although GPER signaling was originally thought to be tumor-promoting in breast cancer, subsequent reports suggest that nonclassical estrogen signaling is tumor suppressive in breast cancer. Consistent with this, recent studies showed that the presence of GPER protein in human breast cancer biopsies correlates with longer survival, suggesting a tumor suppressive role. In line with findings in breast cancer, GPER signaling has also been shown to be tumor suppressive in adrenocortical carcinoma, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, Leydig cell tumors, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, melanoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. Together, these reports suggest that GPER is a tumor suppressor in a wide range of cancer types, and activation of GPER may represent a new therapeutic strategy to treat cancer.

On April 27, 1999, the company, headed by ex-Capcom employees Joe Morici and George Nakayama, renamed itself Metro3D, Inc. after signing an agreement with Nintendo of America to become a third-party developer for Nintendo 64 and GBC games. The company's CEO, Dr. Stephen C. H. Lin, and the U.S. branch of the company filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 19, 2004, after defaulting on a series of loans from Cathay Bank totaling $6.5 million. The company's European division was sold off in June 2005 to Stewart Green of Green Solutions Limited (the parent of Data Design Interactive), but continued to operate in the region.

Studies In May 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released the report, Capacity Needs in the National Airspace System, 2007–2025 as part of its Future Airport Capacity Task (FACT2). The report identified Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the Atlanta metropolitan area as needing additional capacity by 2025. Following the report release, Atlanta was given a $1 million federal grant to study the possibility of adding another airport. Both Atlanta and Delta Air Lines, which operates its primary hub there, expressed skepticism about building a second airport because it would be expensive and will likely economically fail, according to Delta. In 2011, the Atlanta Metropolitan Aviation Capacity Study, Phase II was completed by the FAA, the City of Atlanta and a consulting team. The study concluded that Dobbins Air Reserve Base was the best site from a market potential and development cost perspective, however, the airspace and environmental aspects were problematic. The second best possible site was Cobb County Airport due to its accessibility, yet the high development costs were prohibitive. In 2014, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport unveiled its 20-year Master Expansion Plan to adequately cover the air travel capacity needs in the Atlanta area through 2035. Alternatives An additional commercial airport for the Atlanta metropolitan area could be created by expansion of an existing general aviation airport, conversion of an air force base or by new construction on a greenfield site. =Silver Comet Field at Paulding Northwest Atlanta Airport= In 1975, in anticipation of a second airport, the City of Atlanta purchased of land west of the city in Paulding County for . In early 2007 Paulding County purchased of the property for a new general aviation airport (opened in 2009 as Paulding County Regional Airport), however Atlanta's second commercial airport could still be built on the remaining property. Paulding County is unserved by either rapid transit or freeways. =Dawson Forest= Road in Dawson Forest The City of Atlanta also owns of land located southwest of Dawsonville, Georgia, which was purchased in 1972 from Lockheed, and was the previous site of the Georgia Nuclear Aircraft Laboratory (GNAL). The property is currently referred to as the Dawson Forest City of Atlanta Tract, and managed by the Georgia Forestry Commission with a trail system open to the public. The tract is located approximately from the end of limited access on State Route 400 north of Cumming, Georgia. An area of previously occupied by GNAL was restricted following 1978 testing which found residual nuclear radiation from the experiments performed there. Subsequent studies in 1991 and 1997 found radiation levels to be at or slightly above normal background levels. The property also encompasses Amicalola Creek, which various groups are lobbying to be designated as a scenic river. The forest has also been proposed for use as a major reservoir for the city of Atlanta water system. =Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport= Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA) officials and a Georgia state senator have proposed expansion of the airport, located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as a solution to Atlanta's capacity needs. Sen. Jeff Mullis's idea includes a maglev train to connect Atlanta passengers to CHA. Like the Western and Atlantic Railroad (Georgia's first state railroad), it would be built cooperatively by the state with the help of Tennessee. Chattanooga's airport currently operates at a small portion of its capacity, but additional capacity would be necessary to be Atlanta's second airport. Expansion would be difficult as the property is currently bounded by significant roads, a railroad line and a creek bed. =Dobbins Air Reserve Base= Dobbins Air Reserve Base, located just northwest of Atlanta along Interstate 75, was originally intended as a second civilian airport prior to World War II. However, Dobbins would only be available if a future Department of Defense Base Realignment and Closure commission decided to close the base. As of 2015, no additional BRAC commission is planned. =Northeast Georgia Regional Airport= After the announcement of the second airport study, a long-dormant commission created in 1989 by the Georgia General Assembly in hopes of creating a regional airport to northeast Georgia reconstituted itself. The Northeast Georgia Surface and Air Transportation Commission is now planning to create studies for a 20- or 24-gate airport in the region that could provide relief for Hartsfield drawing traffic from Atlanta's northeast suburbs. While the earlier incarnation of the commission narrowed options to the expansion of Gwinnett County's Briscoe Field, the Dawson Forest site, and a site in Jackson County, the new version will consider expansion of the Barrow County-based general aviation Northeast Georgia Regional Airport. The facility is extending an existing runway to and although it currently occupies only , there is adjacent undeveloped land for expansion.

The TREX engine is a standalone component that can be used in a range of system environments but is used primarily as an integral part of SAP products such as Enterprise Portal, Knowledge Warehouse, and Business Intelligence (BI, formerly SAP Business Information Warehouse). In SAP NetWeaver BI, the TREX engine powers the BI Accelerator, which is a plug-in appliance for enhancing the performance of online analytical processing. The name \\"TREX\\" stands for Text Retrieval and information EXtraction, but it is not a registered trademark of SAP and is not used in marketing collateral. Search functions TREX supports various kinds of text search, including exact search, boolean search, wildcard search, linguistic search (grammatical variants are normalized for the index search) and fuzzy search (input strings that differ by a few letters from an index term are normalized for the index search). Result sets are ranked using term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weighting, and results can include snippets with the search terms highlighted. TREX supports text mining and classification using a vector space model. Groups of documents can be classified using query based classification, example based classification, or a combination of these plus keyword management. TREX supports structured data search not only for document metadata but also for mass business data and data in SAP BusinessObjects. Indexes for structured data are implemented compactly using data compression and the data can be aggregated in linear time, to enable large volumes of data to be processed entirely in memory. Recent developments include: * A join engine to join structured data from different fields in business objects * A fast update capability to write a delta index beside a main index and to merge them offline while a second delta index takes updates * A data mining feature pack for advanced mathematical analysis History The first code for the engine was written in 1998 and TREX became an SAP component in 2000. The SAP NetWeaver BI Accelerator was first rolled out in 2005. As of Q1 2013, the current release of TREX is SAP NW 7.1.  Security  A security vulnerability in TREX was first identified and fixed in 2015 (see SAP Security Note 2234226). The vulnerability occurred due to lack of authentication in TREXnet, an internal communication protocol. The aforementioned patch fixed the problem by removing some critical functionality. Later on, ERPScan head of threat intelligence Mathieu Geli continued to look into the vulnerability and found that the vulnerability was still exploitable . Moreover, in case of successful attack, the vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to get full control over the server without authorization . The vulnerability has been finally patched via SAP Security Note 2419592.

It was previously known as 94.5 The Fox under the calls WFBX, and played rock music. With a 100,000 watt signal, it is by far the most powerful talk radio station in the Panama City market. It features Rush Limbaugh and Todd Schnitt in the midday and morning talk with Preston Scott. WFLF-FM broadcasts local news and weather updates from WJHG, the local NBC affiliate, twice an hour, plus updates from Fox News Radio following each local newscast. The station also carries the Wall Street Journal Report at the top of each hour, and Traffic Alerts twice an hour during AM and PM drive. History WFLF-FM first signed on at 93.5 MHz in 1977 as WGCV, a station licensed to Port St Joe, Florida. In 1982, Don Crisp bought WGCV (as well as AM station WJOE 1080), moved, and upgraded the FM signal to 94.5 with 100 kW of power. The stations were sold in 1983 to Brown Broadcasting (affiliated with John Brown University of Siloam Springs, Arkansas). WGCV changed their calls to WJST. WJOE's calls were changed to WJBU, where they would stay until the station's last days in 1989. WJST was originally a rock station called \\"T-94\\". Initially, WJST was on a shorter, 500-foot tower (alongside WJBU), but in 1986 WJST moved to a 1,000-foot tower. Brown sold the stations to Champion in 1986, who immediately sold the stations to Asterisk, Inc. WJST then became a country station, but proved unable to compete effectively with the already established WPAP. WJST had a call letter change to WWZR in 1989, and adopted SMN's \\"Z Rock\\" format. This format only lasted until 28 January 1990, when it switched to Southern Gospel music. From 1991 until 1993, the station was a member of Westwood One's Real Country network. In 1993, the station's calls were changed again to WKNB. Marketed as \\"B94.5\\", WKNB aired a modern country format for just under a year, when in 1994 its calls were changed to WPBH and it operated under the name \\"Beach 94.5\\" for three years. In 1997, WPBH (as well as WPAP, WDIZ, and WFSY) was sold to ClearChannel (now iHeartMedia) and its callsign was changed again to WPPT. It was the second station in the Panama City market to have the \\"Pirate Radio\\" moniker (the first being WTBB from 1992-1997), and existed until 2002. In 2002, the station flipped to an Active Rock format called \\"The Fox 94.5\\" and its calls were changed to WFBX. This lasted until 2007 when, after the calls were changed to WFLF-FM, the station became an affiliate of Fox News Radio, with ClearChannel's WFLA branding.

It was privately built by Lord Clifford in 1843, and throughout its life carried ball clay for use in the production of pottery. It closed in 1928, when its function was replaced by road vehicles. History The area to the north of the River Teign, particularly near to Chudleigh Knighton, Kingsteignton and Preston, was an important source of ball clay in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Most of the extraction sites were owned by Lord Clifford, who lived at Ugbrooke House. The clay was taken to Hackney Clay Cellars for drying, and was then transferred to Teignmouth by packhorse, where it was loaded into coasters for delivery to the pottery industry. The situation was far from ideal, particularly as the Teignmouth moorings were tidal, and the high tidal range made loading difficult. In order to improve the situation, Lord Clifford built a canal to link the clay pits to the River Teign. Its terminus was close to the Newton Abbot to Kingsteignton road. The canal opened on 17 March 1843. It was long, and had a single lock where it joined the river that was , with a depth of over the lower cill. The wooden boats which sailed on the estuary were around long and wide, with a flat bottom, a rounded bow and a flat transom stern. They were fitted with a single square sail, like a Viking longboat, and in many respects were very similar to the Humber keels which plied the waterways of the north east of England. The length of the lock enabled two boats to use it at the same time. In 1844 the South Devon Railway Company built a bridge over the canal, with the harbour commissioners of the port of Teignmouth retaining John Rennie to ensure that, among other things, the bridge over the canal was large enough to allow boat traffic to continue. In 1858, the Newton and Moretonhampstead Railway was authorised, although the company was reconstituted as the Moretonhampstead and South Devon Railway in 1861, before any work began. It was effectively owned by the South Devon Railway. The neighbouring Stover Canal negotiated with the company, and they bought out the canal for £8,000 in 1862. A month after the acquisition, the minutes recorded a letter from Watts, Blake and Company, who traded on that canal, asking what price they would be willing to sell the canal for, as they believed the directors intended to dispose of it. Although there is no record of the railway company buying the Hackney Canal, a letter was received at the same time from Mr Whiteway, acting on behalf of a Mr Knight who held the lease for the Hackney Canal, asking much the same question. The railway company agreed to notify both parties that no decisions had been made to dispose of their canal interests. =Decline= The canal ceased to be used in 1928. Since the terminus was next to a main road, the advent of the motor lorry resulted in its closure. The basin was briefly used by a company building yachts in 1954, but they resorted to sending the completed boats to Teignmouth by lorry, and moved to Brixham soon afterwards. A wall was constructed around the lock in 1955 after high tides in the estuary broke through and flooded Newton Abbot Racecourse. Route The terminus was close to the Kingsteignton road, and consisted of a basin with buildings on both sides. The basin was filled in to enable lorries to turn, and the buildings were for many years used by A J Booker's Autobodies as a car body workshop. Although they were grade II listed structures, all except one were demolished in 2001 as part of a redevelopment of the area. The tow-path followed the north bank of the canal, and the water supply entered the canal from a leat which passed under the tow-path to the east of the wharf buildings, crossing over a drainage ditch on an aqueduct before it did so. To the south of the wharf area was Newton Abbot Potteries, built before 1905, and labelled \\"Bricks and Pipes\\" on the 1956 map.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1905 and 1956 After a short distance, the canal turned to the south-east, and followed a nearly straight line across what is now the end of Newton Abbot racecourse. In 1969, the end of the racetrack followed the west bank of the canal,Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1969 but by 1989 the track had been extended across the site of the canal. A drainage ditch crosses the area, which gives an indication of where the canal was, since the ditch was on the west side of the canal before it was filled in.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1956 and 1989 Just beyond the second crossing by the race track are the remains of the lock and the wall which prevents the Teign flooding the area. The route turns to the east, to pass under the railway line, and joins the Hackney channel of the River Teign.

Firn is a type of snow that has been left over from past seasons and has been recrystallized into a substance denser than névé. It is at an intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice. Permafrost is soil at or below the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F) for two or more years. In practice it is a large stretch of land (found mostly in Siberia) with soil frozen all over deep to the bottom. \\"Meta incognita\\" means \\"unknown frontier\\" in Latin. It's also another name for Baffin Island.

The integrated software genre has been largely overshadowed by fully functional office suites, most notably Microsoft Office, but at one time was considered the \\"killer application\\" type responsible for the rise and dominance of the IBM PC in the desktop business computing world. In the early days of the PC before GUIs became common, user interfaces were text-only and were operated mostly by function key and modifier key sequences. Every program used a different set of keystrokes, making it difficult for a user to master more than one or two programs. Programs were loaded from floppy disk, making it very slow and inconvenient to switch between programs and difficult or impossible to exchange data between them (to transfer the results from a spreadsheet to a word processor document for example). In response to these limitations, vendors created multifunction \\"integrated\\" packages, eliminating the need to switch between programs and presenting the user with a more consistent interface. The convenience of an all-in-one purchase as well as the potential for greater ease-of-use made integrated software attractive to home markets as well as business, and packages such as the original AppleWorks for the Apple II, Vizastar for the Commodore 64 and Jane for the Commodore 128 were developed in the 1980s to run on most popular home computers of the day. Commodore even produced the Plus/4 computer with a simple integrated suite built into ROM. Context MBA was an early example of the genre, and featured spreadsheet, database, chart-making, word processing and terminal emulation functions. However, because it was written in Pascal for portability, it ran slowly on the relatively underpowered systems of the day. Lotus 1-2-3, which followed it, had fewer functions but was written in x86 assembler, providing it with a speed advantage that allowed it to become the predominant business application for personal computers in the 1980s. BYTE asked in 1984, \\"Why should owners of advanced, multifunction business programs that are supposedly easy to use and that claim to solve all problems be compelled to purchase a utility like Sidekick? It makes you wonder about all those advertising claims.\\" Perhaps Framework and Symphony represented the peak of integrated software products, amid questions about the genre's viability under the new graphical user interfaces. The GUI on a Macintosh or Microsoft Windows, based around a desktop metaphor and typically enforcing a set of user interface guidelines for developers, enjoyed much greater consistency between standalone applications, removing one of the main motivations behind integrated packages. Microsoft stated in 1985 that hardware limited the power of all-in-one programs, and that simultaneously using multiple applications like Excel under Switcher on the Macintosh—with common user interfaces and ability to share data—was preferable to \\"fully integrated\\" software. Jerry Pournelle agreed, adding that \\"it's going to be difficult to sell full integration to users. There's just too much to learn. Old hands looking for an improved text editor may not care to change spreadsheets. Newcomers almost certainly won't want to learn about spreadsheets, databases, text editors, and communications all at once.\\" Also, \\"users want to be able to pick and choose programs according to their particular needs\\". PC Magazine said in 1993 that \\"reports of the death of integrated software under Windows have been greatly exaggerated\\", however, because the realities of software development and market considerations made integrated software still attractive to notebook owners, home and small- business users, and others. Microsoft developed its own suite, Works, for such customers, with Claris's ClarisWorks as a competitor. Developers of standalone products introduced integrated versions with additional abilities like Wordperfect Works, which was based on an earlier competitor to AppleWorks made by Beagle Bros. The 1990s also saw the rise of the office suite concept exemplified by Microsoft Office and LibreOffice, which resemble integrated software but involve more complex software with greater abilities that, in many cases, are also sold as standalone products.

Route description US‑26 enters Nebraska from Wyoming, and shortly thereafter enters Henry. After passing through Morrill, US‑26 becomes a divided highway. At Mitchell, US‑26 meets Nebraska Highway 29 (N‑29). Continuing southeast, US‑26 enters Scottsbluff. Through Scottsbluff, US‑26 runs concurrent with N‑71 and N‑92 on a highway which goes through northern Scottsbluff. After N‑71 and N‑92 separate, US‑26 continues to Minatare, Nebraska, where the divided highway ends. The highway runs due east until an intersection with Nebraska Link 62A (L-62A), when the highway turns south. US‑26 passes through Bayard and, after crossing the North Platte River meets with N‑92 again near Chimney Rock. US‑26 and N‑92 turn southeast towards Bridgeport. At Bridgeport, N‑92 separates and US‑26 meets US‑385. They cross the North Platte River together, and separate. US‑26 continues southeasterly on the north side of the North Platte River. At Broadwater, US‑26 begins its third concurrency with N‑92. They run together through Lisco, Oshkosh, and Lewellen. At Oshkosh, US‑26 meets Nebraska Highway 27. At Lewellen, US‑26 and N‑92 separate for the last time and shortly thereafter, US‑26 crosses the North Platte River again. After passing through Ash Hollow State Historical Park, the highway passes through no communities until meeting N‑61 northwest of Ogallala. US‑26 runs concurrent with N‑61 the rest of its length in Nebraska. The two highways go south to US‑30, then the three highways run concurrent into Ogallala. They then separate from US‑30, turn south to cross the South Platte River and US‑26 ends at I‑80. History From the creation of the highway in 1926 until the 1930s, US-26 went north of the North Platte River east of Lewellen. This alignment went east to Martin, where US‑26 met N-61 and the two highways went south from there into Ogallala. When Lake McConaughy was built in the 1930s, the current alignment was constructed.Nebraska Roads: US 6-38 Major intersections Related route Between 1936 and 1959, there was a U.S. Highway 26N. It went east along today's L-62A, then south along today's US-385 to just north of Bridgeport and east along today's US‑26 to Broadwater. In those years, the mainline of US‑26 between Bridgeport and Broadwater went on the south side of the North Platte River, along today's Nebraska Highway 92.The Nebraska Highways Page: Highways 1 to 30 References 26 Transportation in Sioux County, Nebraska Transportation in Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska Transportation in Morrill County, Nebraska Transportation in Garden County, Nebraska Transportation in Keith County, Nebraska Nebraska ","title":"U.S. Route 26 in Nebraska"},{"id":"13179485","text":"Gunnar Graps-Grāfs (27 November 1951 – 17 May 2004) was a popular Estonian musician and one of the pioneers of hard rock in Estonia and Soviet Union. He has sold hundreds of thousands of records all over the world and in 2004 Graps was given a lifetime award at Estonian Music Awards. He has been compared to Mick Jagger and Alice Cooper, both who were his own personal idols, and is often called Raudmees (Iron man). Biography =Start of music career, 1960s= Gunnar Graps was born to Latvian conductor, cellist and musical pedagogue Igors Graps and his Estonian wife Salme in Tallinn. Graps was inspired to turn to music by his father at the age of six when he started to learn cello. In 1964, being only 13, he joined his first band Satelliidid as a guitarist. In spring of 1967 Graps joined Mikronid, where he played drums for the next six years. In 1970–1972 he was in the army and during that period he performed with Ivo Linna. He spent another year behind the drums in Mikronid after his return from military service. In spring 1968 Jüri Lina recorded about ten Mikronid's songs which also included Graps' creation for his show \\"Pobifo Revüü\\". =Golden-Age of his music, 1970s= After leaving the group Mikronid Graps created Ornament in 1973, which was one of the pioneers of hard rock in Estonia and the Soviet Union (Estonia was part of the USSR at the time). Ornament's music was influenced by Led Zeppelin and psychedelic rock. In 1976 Graps put together a new outfit called Magnetic Band which was Jazz- rock oriented, with reggae and funk-soul influences. In 1977 Graps graduated from Tallinn Music School, from the percussion instruments department. Soon after that he reformed his group and they started leaning towards hard rock. Soon Magnetic Band became one of the most popular heavy-music bands in the Soviet Union. They won first prize at the first official rock-festival of the Soviet Union which took place in Tbilisi thanks to their hit \\"Lady Blues\\" and became the stars of Yerevan-81 international pop-rock-festival. \\"Garbed in fire-engine red pants and white shirt decorated with a splashy 7-Up emblem, Graps sang: \\"Since we have nowhere else to make love/we do it out in the open/And sometimes the rain washes away the makeup/from her face—and mine\\", wrote Time magazine in 1981.\\"Tired? Nyet!\\", by G. Russell // Time magazine, Monday, October 12, 1981 =At the top, 1980s= His popularity peaked in the 1980s. Magnetic Band constantly toured the Soviet Union. In 1982, Washington Post dedicated a whole page to Gunnar Graps and the Magnetic Band.\\"Moscow's 'Mick Jagger' Delights Fans, Perplexes Officials\\", by Michael Dobbs // Washington Post, August 15, 1982 Page A15, First Section It was no surprise that in 1983 Magnetic Band got banned by the Soviet authorities, which led to creation of GGG (Gunnar Graps Group). The change also marked a shift towards straightforward hard rock and heavy metal, genres which Magnetic Band were already flirting with (Note: all the musical groups in Soviet Union had to be evaluated before they were allowed to perform or exist at all). New winds began to blow in the Soviet Union as Mikhail Gorbachev took the seat of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and GGG experienced less resistance from authorities. In 1988 they released their only LP entitled Põlemine (Burning). The vinyl was issued by Melodiya, a Soviet record company – the only one in the whole USSR. Distribution of the record was very high. At the time, GGG consisted of Gunnar Graps (drums, percussion, vocals, keyboards), Juri Stihhanov (lead guitar), Andres Aak (now known as Angela Aak, rhythm guitar), Jüri Roosa (bass guitar) and Tiit Altosaar (drums on some songs, as Graps tended to perform most drumming (along with singing) himself). They performed in Estonia and the rest of the Soviet Union and were very popular until their fade in the end of decade. Their most popular songs were \\"Põlemine\\" (Burning), \\"Valgus\\" (Light), the ballad \\"Mosaiik\\" (Mosaic), \\"Raudmees\\" (Iron Man) – a song which gave Graps his nickname. As the grip on the Baltic states became less of a strangle-hold, the Singing Revolution began to take shape. In 1987 a choir composed of well-known Estonian singers, Gunnar Graps among them, recorded Alo Mattiisen's song \\"Ei ole üksi ükski maa\\", a patriotic song about Estonia. In 1989 Gunnar Graps moved to the United States in the hopes of reaching new heights with his musical career but, alas, failed to reach those previous lofty heights and was compelled to work as a repairman – to \\"make ends meet\\". =Start of decline, 1990s= After Estonia regained its independence in 1991, Graps returned to his homeland. In the summer of 1993, he was caught, while working as a DJ at the nightclub on the ferryboat \\"Estonia\\", trying to cross the Swedish border with anabolic steroids and was imprisoned for two months in Sweden. He did not complain about his imprisonment; in fact, he praised the jail as being better than restaurants in Estonia. Eesti Ekspress / Pensionireformi sümbool After his release, Graps came back to Estonia. Financial problems arose once more and he was compelled to work at local radio stations and night-clubs as a DJ, playing music he hated. In 1995, Graps released \\"Tühjad pihud\\" (Empty Hands) and reformed GGG the next year, performing about once a month. Graps was becoming more and more depressed. =Last years= Starting in the 21st century, Graps was still having financial troubles and performed in a series of Hansapank pension fund commercials. The commercials included a word play of \\"Tühjad pihud\\" (Empty Hands) record. In 2002, a 3 CD collection of Gunnar Graps' music, from all his tenures with past bands, was released as part of \\"Eesti kullafond\\" (Estionian Gold Fund) series. In 2003, Gunnar Graps performed at one of his last big concerts before death. An incarnation of Magnetic Band played in front of approx. 600 people at Green Christmas Festival in Rakvere, Estonia. Despite his health problems, Graps did not want to give up on music and in 2003 he released \\"Rajalt maas\\" (Off the Track), which had a strong blues influence. In one of his last interviews Graps promised to go on tour in Russia, because he was disappointed in the local music scene. Three months before his death he was still looking forward to continue his career and in an interview for Sakala, an Estonian newspaper, he promised to release a new album by the end of 2004 and another record in 2005.Sakala On 17 May 2004, at the age of 52, Gunnar Graps died of a heart attack at his home on Mooni street in Tallinn. Legacy Gunnar Graps is considered a rock idol by Estonians. Another popular Estonian band Metsatöll has said that Gunnar Graps means the same to Estonian metal as Black Sabbath means to the world.Metsatöll Also, numerous tribute events have spawned, paying homage to the early departed musician. These events are orchestrated by Radio Mania, a local radio station, and Hard Rock Club, local events promoter and take place around Graps' birthday month and death month. A string of local bands usually perform at the event along with incarnations of GGG or Magnetic Band, with people Graps used to play with. Gunnar Graps was inducted into the Hall Of Fame of Rock Cafe, a local pub (operated by the owners of Radio Mania, also the place where the tribute events take place), on 17 May 2005. In December 2005, Hard Rock Club started collecting funds to erect a memorial headstone at Graps' grave.Hard Rock Club Online A fund-rising concert was held on 5 March 2006 at Rock Cafe in Tallinn. The stone was designed by Graps' son Jan Graps and placed on his grave at Rahumäe cemetery on 17 May 2006.Täna avatakse Gunnar Grapsi mälestuskivi – SL Õhtuleht A cover band – Gunnar's Roses – was also active at some point during 2005–2006, performing at Hard Rock Laager in 2005 (a heavy metal festival created by Hard Rock Club) and at smaller pubs. The band was put together by Henri \\"Suss\\" Hinno (drummer of Manatark and Must Missa) who took the role of the drummer. Hinno is known to be a big fan of Graps' work and sang \\"Mosaiik\\" live with Gunnar's Roses. In 2011, dramatist Ivar Põllu's play Raudmees. Odysseuse eksirännakud, which focuses of the life of Graps, was performed at the New Tartu Theatre in Tartu. Directed by Robert Annus, the play featured actor Juss Haasma as Graps and a musical score that consisted of many of Graps' most well-known songs. Uus Teater Raudmees. Odysseuse eksirännakud 27 November 2011. Retrieved 9 February 2017. Singing style Gunnar Graps' singing style was somewhat similar to the style James Hetfield of Metallica used to have, which was essentially trying to sing from the throat to produce a raspier sound. A very busy schedule contributed to the development of his signature rasp. It was not uncommon for Graps to perform even 3 shows per day and 25 days in a month. He was still able to produce very high notes, as is evident from his songs and Jesus Christ Superstar song \\"Gethsamen\\", which is included on the Gunnar Graps – Eesti kullafond 4. He is known to have trained his voice by yelling at walls; he usually did it before going on stage.

Compiled by Rush's then-U.S. label Mercury, it has an AOR sampling of tracks from the band's second, third and fourth albums (Fly by Night, Caress of Steel and 2112 respectively), bypassing selections from their 1974 first album, Rush. Rush had received substantial airplay from FM stations, but their subsequent LPs had not, partly due to both the increasing length and complex nature of the material. 2112 had been a surprise success in 1976, but still had not received much airplay. The band were working on a fifth studio album to be released later in 1977, so presumably the compilation was intended to promote some of the more radio- friendly tracks from the albums in between.Rush chronological history Incidentally, the album's back cover has a blurb from Circus magazine with the headline \\"'Closer To The Heart' Will Be The Group's Sixth LP\\".

In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History The village was originally established in 1939 by European members of Zionist youth movements who had fled Nazi Germany to Mandatory Palestine via Youth Aliyah. David Coren, later a member of the Knesset, was also amongst the founders. It was named after the biblical village of the same name allocated to the tribe of Benjamin (), located in the Arabah plain, and means \\"House in the Desert\\". According to the Jewish National Fund, the Kibbutz became famous for its experiments in land reclamation, the residents reclaiming land that had never been previously cultivated.

Recorded in Pennsylvania and California, it was released on 8 September 2007 by Filthy Note in the UK and DRP Records in the US. The album is the band's first to feature guitarist Julian \\"Jules\\" Cooper and drummer Jess Margera, who replaced Darren Smith and Gordon Morrison, respectively, in 2006. Background Following the release and promotion of the band's debut full- length studio album Born in Hell, Viking Skull's fate was brought into question when guitarist and drummer Darren Smith and Gordon Morrison left. By the end of 2006 both departed members had been replaced, with Julian \\"Jules\\" Cooper taking over guitar duties and Jess Margera of CKY fame joining on drums. Margera has claimed that he unwittingly contributed to the lineup changes, causing members to argue during a night of drinking on his tour bus. Much of the recording for Chapter Two took place in Pennsylvania, Margera's home state, and was funded by the drummer. Margera's CKY bandmate, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg, engineered and mixed the album, alongside fellow engineers Phil Nicolo, Cody Cochowski and Tommy Joyner. Ginsburg and Unkle Matt and the ShitBirdz member Rich Vose performed additional guitars on \\"The Hidden Flame\\", while Fireball Ministry frontman Reverend James Rota performed additional vocals on the song. Promotion In promotion of Chapter Two, Viking Skull completed a short UK tour in January 2008 comprising six shows in Glasgow, York, Birmingham, Leeds, Cardiff and London, with support provided by Year Long Disaster. The band also performed their first show in the US on 26 July 2008 at the Filthy Note Theatre in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Margera's hometown. Customers who purchased the album from CD Baby in 2007 also received a free copy of the band's second extended play (EP), Blackened Sunrise, as well as the music video for the song of the same name, which was directed by Bam Margera. \\"Blackened Sunrise\\" was also featured on Viva la Bands, Volume 2. In 2010, the album was reissued on vinyl featuring two extra tracks: \\"Skulls and Whiskey\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Thunder\\". Reception Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net awarded Chapter Two a rating of 7.5 out of 10, a higher score than he awarded to Born in Hell (6.5 out of 10). Bergman praised several guitar riffs on the album (including \\"Blackened Sunrise\\" and \\"The Hidden Flame\\") as \\"flat-out fucking righteous\\" and claimed that Chapter Two was \\"a quantum leap over the band's debut, and ... a whole different beast\\". However, he did suggest that the album was \\"an odd mix of styles\\", and also called it \\"pretty basic and short\\".

She was most closely involved with the couple's youngest child, Prince John, whom she nursed devotedly from 1905 until his death in 1919.Van Der Kiste, p. 44  Employment  Lala began her employment as the under-nurse to the York children. Working under the head nurse, she was shocked at the nurse's treatment of the royal children. The nurse appeared to resent every new addition to the nursery, and neglected the second son, Bertie, later King George VI, to the point where he became ill as a result.Van Der Kiste, p. 11 The head nurse had originally been a nursemaid to The Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, and earned a good reference. However, when Lala expressed her concerns, it was revealed that the woman was childless after her husband deserted her, and was therefore suffering from a warped and frustrated maternal instinct.Van Der Kiste, p. 11 She was promptly dismissed in 1897 and Lala was appointed in her place.Van Der Kiste, p. 11 As the children grew up, she became especially close to the youngest child, Prince John, who suffered from epilepsy, and learning difficulties caused by possible autism. Although the Prince originally stayed at York Cottage, the compact residence of his mother and father, a separate household was established for him in 1917, and they moved to nearby Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate. Lala nursed Prince John (Johnny as he was called in the family) until his death from a severe epileptic seizure on 18 January 1919, following the end of the First World War. It was Lala who telephoned Queen Mary to inform her of his death, and she and the King travelled from Buckingham Palace to Wood Farm to see their dead son. Lala attended his burial at Sandringham Church, where he was interred next to Prince Alexander John of Wales, the infant son of Queen Alexandra, Johnnie's grandmother.  Life after Johnny  She remained devoted to the memory of the young prince right up to her own death in 1964 when she was approaching her nineties. On one visit to her house, The Duke of Windsor noticed that the first object he saw when he walked into Bill's house was a large photo of Johnny as a toddler on her fireplace mantel. Legacy Her character appears in the film The Lost Prince, where she is played by Gina McKee. A novel called The Royal Nanny by Karen Harper recounts the story of Charlotte Bill (Lala/Mrs. Lala) and her time with the royal children. Notes Sources *Reynolds, K.

His awards include the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Media Photographers,janfeb98.pdf and the Infinity Award from the International Center of Photography. Biography Maisel (pronounced may'-zel') was born on January 18, 1931, in Brooklyn, New York City and attended Abraham Lincoln High School where he studied under Leon Friend. He studied painting and graphic design at Manhattan's Cooper Union and at Yale University, and became a photographer in 1954. One of Maisel's most notable images is his photograph of Miles Davis that appears on the cover of Davis's album Kind of Blue (1959). In 2009, Andy Baio created an image based on the original Kind of Blue album cover for the cover of a chiptune tribute album titled Kind of Bloop. Attorneys representing Maisel demanded damages and that the resulting image be removed from the chiptune album, resulting in an out-of-court settlement of $32,500 from Baio. For almost 50 years Maisel lived with his family in the historic Germania Bank Building on the Bowery in lower Manhattan. Built in 1898, the building contains 72 rooms over six floors. Maisel purchased the building in 1966 for $102,000 when the neighborhood was in severe decline. He used it as a single-family residence and studio. The building's value was estimated at $30 to $50 million in 2008. New York magazine called it \\"maybe the greatest real-estate coup of all time\\". It cost $300,000 annually to maintain, including heat and taxes.Jay Myself, documentary film by Stephen Wilkes, 2019 In February 2015, the building was sold for $55 million to developer Aby Rosen. A 2019 film, Jay Myself, documents Maisel's life and his move from the building.

From 1988-91, he appeared twice as two different Texas state senators on Dallas. His last acting role was in 1991 in an episode of The Trials of Rosie O'Neill.

Saiyuki is a manga written by Kazuya Minekura and published from 1997 to 2002. The manga saw an animated anime television series adaption which ran from 2000 to 2001 and had a total of 50 episodes. A movie based on the manga was produced and released in 2001. The series also inspired a live action musical and a video game. The main characters are Genjyo Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo and Hakkai, who face a number of different antagonists throughout the manga series. Main characters =Genjyo Sanzo= One of the main characters and a priest, he is the one who brought the group together to travel to the west under the command from the Sanbutsushin and from Kanzeon Botatsu, the Goddess of Mercy. He is also the one who released Goku from his 500-year prison and who now looks after him like a father. He carries the Maten scripture that some are after but uses his gun (a silver banishing gun in the anime and an ordinary snub-nosed revolver in the manga) as his main weapon. Some demons come after him because they believe that eating a priest would make them immortal, but that was soon proved wrong. Ill-tempered and cynical, Sanzo is frequently smacking Goku on the head with his fan whenever he does or says something annoying and constantly shoots at both him and Gojyo whenever they start arguing. Despite the fact that he refuses to openly acknowledge the other members of his group as friends, Sanzo deeply cares for his teammates and will do whatever it takes to protect them. Sanzo's real name is Koryu, which he was named by the senior monks of the temple he was raised at as a way to make fun of him. The only people who Sanzo openly recognized and respected were his predecessor and mentor: Koumyou Sanzo, who was killed by demons one night after bestowing the young Koryu the title of Sanzo, and Rikudo, formerly named Shuei, the clerk abbot who was the only other survivor of the attack, and whom Sanzo was later forced to kill out of mercy after using a curse known as \\"Araya\\". Sanzo is voiced by Toshihiko Seki in Japanese, with the exception in the original OVA in which he is voiced by Wataru Takagi. In the English dub, he is voiced by David Matranga in the original series, Requiem and Blast, while in Reload and Gunlock he is voiced by Lex Lang. As a child, Sanzo is voiced by Yuko Kobayashi in Japanese of the original series and by Kahoru Sasajima in Reload. In the English dub he is voiced by Kevin Corn in the first two seasons, by Mona Marshall at the start of Reload and Gunlock and by Mela Lee in the later episodes of Reload. =Goku= is the cheerful \\"Monkey King\\" who uses a staff, known as the Nyoi-Bo, as his primary weapon. There is no explanation given in the anime as to the origin of Goku's weapon; in the manga, it is revealed that the Nyoi-bo was sealed in a canister in the temple, which he and Gojyo shattered whilst goofing off. He is the Seiten Taisei, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, and whose true self and powers are released when his diadem is removed. As the Seiten Taisei he is very destructive and cruel, and nearly invincible. He's even able to take in the Earth's energy and regenerate because he was spawned from the sheer energy of the earth itself. During Saiyuki Gaiden, Goku was made a ward of Konzen and befriends both Tenpou and Kenren. When his diadem was removed, Goku killed many celestial beings in his craze. Konzen, Tenpou, and Kenren work to protect Goku, but all four became banished from Heaven. Goku was locked in cage high in the mountains and lost his memories. Goku is found by Sanzo and freed from his imprisonment, and Sanzo becomes something like a foster father to Goku. Goku accompanies Sanzo on his mission to track down Hakkai, and helps to prevent Hakkai from killing himself, and Hakkai later becomes his teacher. Goku joins Sanzo, Hakkai, and Gojyo to stop the resurrection of Gyumaoh, during which he discovered that he was Seiten Taisei, having previously been aware of it. Goku is voiced by Sōichirō Hoshi in Japanese, with the exception of when he was voiced by Kōsuke Okano in the first OVA series. He is voiced in English by Greg Ayres in the original series, Requiem, and Blast, while Yuri Lowenthal voiced him in Reload and Gunlock. =Gojyo= is a hanyou, a cross between a yokai and a human, and uses the Shakugetsujou, a metal weapon staff with a sickle and chain, as his primary weapon. In the anime it is revealed that Gojyo can hold his breath for prolonged periods of time while submerged, possibly an inheritance from his demon father, who may have been a water demon (hence, Gojyo's own nickname as \\"Kappa\\"). His eyes and hair are blood-red, which expresses his status as a half-blood. Due to this, he is labeled as taboo and unclean by general society. As a child, he was perpetually being either ignored or beaten by his stepmother, who had been devastated to learn that her husband had an affair with a human woman. In the manga, Gojyo's father and his human mother commit suicide; there is no explanation of their deaths given in the anime. After the deaths of his father and mother Gojyo was given to his father's youkai wife. He was very close to his older brother, Jien, who constantly pacified his mother whenever she became violent toward Gojyo (in the manga, it is revealed that Mama Sha and Jien begin a sexual relationship at this time, but this is never expressly stated in the anime), especially whenever he tried to cheer her up as she was in a permanent state of depression over her husband's infidelity and death. Eventually, their mother goes insane and attempts to kill Gojyo (using her bare hands in the anime and an ax in the manga). Jien kills his mother to save Gojyo's life, but not before she carves two deep scratches into the side of Gojyo's face. Torn with shame and guilt over the tragedy, Jien abandons Gojyo, and the brothers only meet again years later on opposite sides of their current conflict. Gojyo smokes, gambles, and flirts with nearly every woman he meets (the last trait is implied to be mainly due to the trauma of being unloved by his abusive stepmother, despite his constant efforts at winning her affection). He and Goku are also prone to fighting, like brothers will, and are often scolded by Sanzo as a result. Gojyo is quick to defend others and holds particular sympathy towards threatened children. Gojyo is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata in Japanese, with the exception of the first OVA series, in which he was voiced by Kōichi Yamadera. He is voiced by Illich Guardiola in English for the original series and Requiem, by Tony Oliver for Reload and Gunlock and by Ian Sinclair in Blast. The child Gojyo in the Japanese version is voiced by Kayu Suzuki in the first series and by Masayo Hosono in Reload and in the English version he is voiced by Sam Foster in the original series and by Julie Ann Taylor in Reload. =Hakkai= is the mild, polite and level-headed member of the group who always looks out for their day to day well-being. Hakkai rarely displays anger, but when he does even Gojyo and Goku are afraid of him. He also is able to manipulate chi, allowing him to heal others (depending on how wounded they are), and create blasts of chi and make protective barriers. Hakkai also owns a pet dragon, named Hakuryuu (or Jeep). Formerly, Cho Hakkai had been known as Cho Gonou and worked as a school teacher. He was romantically involved with his elder sister, Kanan (not Kanaan), though they hadn't originally known this as they had grown up in separate orphanages (this is revealed in the manga, but is never made clear in the anime). Kanan was later raped by a youkai noble, Hyakugen Maoh, while Gonou was away at work, and despite being rescued, she committed suicide, not wanting to bear the child. Originally human, Hakkai had changed into a youkai after massacring 1000 youkai, consisting of his neighbouring villagers (his killing of the villagers was not depicted or mentioned in the anime), a tribe of crow demons who were blackmailed into sacrificing Kanan in order to save themselves, as well as Hyakugen Maoh himself and the rest of his clan/household. Hakkai is found by Gojyo near-death, and is later tracked down by Sanzo and Goku. He tries to run away, but is confronted by the last surviving member of the crow tribe he massacred who tells Hakkai he ripped out the eyes of his dead brother. To atone, Hakkai proceeds to rip out his own right eye. He is about to tear out his left eye as well but is stopped by Goku. Hakkai then kills the demon, stating that he wants to keep living. In penance for his crime, Cho Gonou was metaphorically killed and reborn as Cho Hakkai. To control his youkai powers, Hakkai wears a set of 3 power limiters, in the form of ear cuffs on his left ear, and he rarely removes them, only doing so when absolutely necessary. As a youkai, although much stronger, he becomes susceptible to the minus waves. Hakkai is voiced by Akira Ishida in Japanese. In English, he is voiced by Braden Hunt for the original series and Requiem, Steve Cannon for Reload and Gunlock, and by Micah Solusod in Blast. As a child Hakkai is voiced by Saori Higashi in the Japanese version and by Nyl Stewart in the English dub. Antagonists =Kougaiji= : Based on Gyumaoh's Son, Kåfēise Dalu Hai Er (meaning \\"brown moose child\\") the Bull Moose Prince, Kougaiji is Gyumaoh's son, and the Sanzo party's most frequently faced enemy. He reluctantly takes part in Ni Jianyi and Koushou's plan in order to restore his mother Rasetsu-nyo, who was turned to stone by a curse. He has no animosity towards the Sanzo party (despite that Goku once beat him to within an inch of his life while in his true form) but makes no effort to hide that he loathes Ni Jianyi and Koushou. He deeply cares for other yōkai, but has never displayed any ill feelings toward humans. Despite that he's willing to let countless humans and yōkai die if it means bringing his mother back. A notable aspect that's added in the anime is that Kougaiji's sense of pride is greatly exaggerated at points. He often passes up chances where he could easily defeat the Sanzo part when they've been weakened in some way, desiring to defeat them when they're at full strength, and once attempted to singlehandly fight Goku when his power limiter was removed, despite nearly dying when he last fought him in that state. Of everyone he's been around, he's been shown to care for Lirin the most and often attempts to keep her out of battles. He wields power over fire and the ability to summon powerful fiends. He's also a highly skilled hand-to-hand fighter. He generally serves as Goku's opponent. In the Japanese version he is voiced by Takeshi Kusao. In the English version, he is voiced by Vic Mignogna in the original series and Blast. In Reload and Gunlock, he is voiced by Terrence Stone. =Lirin= : Kougaiji's half-sister and Gyokumen Koushou's daughter. She deeply admires Kougaiji, and overall is like a female Son Goku in personality, though she's far more naive than even him. Although she likes fighting, she's also extremely friendly. Lirin is highly skilled hand-to-hand fighter, but she isn't very smart and as running gag Sanzo \\"defeats\\" her just by tossing her a meat bun which she focuses on instead of fighting. Kougaiji is also used to this tactic, diverting her from her assistance by promising to bring her back food from his trip. When Kougaiji's group fights Sanzo's group, she's usually seen on Sanzo's shoulders. Sanzo views her as another monkey, like Son Goku. In the Japanese versions, she is portrayed by Kaoru Morota in the original series and by Tomoko Kawakami in Reload and Gunlock. In the English versions, she is voiced by Hilary Haag in the original series, by M.A. Lovestedt in Reload and by Cindy Robinson in Gunlock. =Dokugakuji= : : Gojyo's full- yōkai half-brother, formerly known as Sha Jien. When he was younger he was very close to his little brother, and attempted to protect him from his violently unstable mother by having an incestuous affair with her. She attempted to kill Gojyo anyway, and Jien was forced to kill his mother to keep her from killing Gojyo; after this he left his home and brother, eventually pledging himself to Kougaiji's service. He's extremely loyal to Kougaiji, Dokugakuji himself believes he may have become attached to Kougaiji in this way for his vague resemblance of Gojyo, though he still seems to love his baby brother. He fights with a large sword which he is able to summon at will (there are only four characters in the series who are able to summon weapons this way: Gojyo, Goku, Dokugaku, and Yaone. No explanation is given as to the origin of Dokugaku's weapon). He generally serves as Gojyo's opponent. In the Japanese versions, he was voiced by Dai Matsumoto in the first series, Jurota Kosugi in Reload and Gunlock and Jin Yamanoi in Blast. In the English version, his voice is done by Jason Miesse in episodes 5-18 and later by Mike MacRae in episodes 20-50 of the original series and by Paul St. Peter in Reload and Gunlock. =Yaone= : An apothecary, alchemist, skilled fighter, and Lirin's \\"babysitter\\". She is deeply devoted to Kougaiji, who saved her from being sacrificed to the Centipede Demon, and has rashly taken on dangerous missions to prove her loyalty to him. As a trained chemist, she also serves as the group's healer. She seems to be friendly enemies with Hakkai; she always addresses him with great respect, and on occasions they work together. Hakkai regards her as a fellow-healer and colleague. In the Japanese version, she is voiced by Yuko Minaguchi. In the English version, she is voiced by Shelley Calene-Black in the original series and by Mela Lee in Reload and Gunlock. =Gyokumen Koushou= Gyokumen Koushou: Gyumaoh's concubine and the mastermind of the plan to revive him. She's extremely cruel and selfish, and has shown to be willing to sacrifice anything to get what she wants, and is shown to enjoy her cruel acts. Has told Kougaiji that she'll only restore his mother to life if he helps her obtain the Five Sacred Scriptures (or Sutras). Despite being Lirin's biological mother she cares nothing about her own daughter and only sees her and Kougaiji as tools. She is voiced by Shinobu Sato in the Japanese version and in the English version she is voiced by Kaytha Coker in the original series and by Wendee Lee in Reload and Gunlock. =Ni Jianyi= Dr. Ni Jianyi: A wild card, mystery man, mad scientist, and Koushou's human lover. He owns a plush rabbit that he carries with him as his pet. He was also once a Sanzo priest (known as Ukoku Sanzo; he was the youngest to attain the rank before Genjo Sanzo, who is around the same age as him) and was considered a heretic because he fought and killed his master (Goudai Sanzo) to attain his title instead of inheriting his chakra from the gods along with the Muten sutra (Which is later revealed to be hidden within the stuffed rabbit). During his time before becoming a priest he easily mastered all material arts and spiritual powers, growing strong enough that he could literally kill others with a wave of his arm. His pupil, a man whose name is never revealed and is known simply as \\"God\\" (Kami-sama), appears in Reload anime, as someone that Ni gave all the power he gained to since he no longer had any use for it, though at some points Ni is hinted to retain his power. Although he's extremely eccentric, he's also intelligent and ruthless. His reasons for aiding in reviving Gyumaoh are a mystery. Mysteriously, he knows of Sanzo's origins. He was also called Ken'yuu before attaining the title of Sanzo. In the original Japanese version, he is voiced by Hochu Ohtsuka and in the English versions by Tommy Drake in the original series and Kirk Thornton in Reload and Gunlock. =Hazel= Hazel Grouse: A bishop from the West (America) with a hatred for youkai, he, like Sanzo, was taken in at a young age by a master who was killed by a youkai. He has sworn to wipe all youkai off of the planet and create a peaceful world for humans alone and has even stated that the lives of 1000 youkai are not worth one human life to him. He makes no exceptions when it comes to the youkai he kills: he sees them all as mindless beasts, berserk or sane, adult or child. He typically relies on his companion, Gat, to fight, but has proven himself as an exorcist able to fell many youkai at once. The pendant he wears around his neck (resembling a star of David) is able to store up to 13 souls (one in each opening), taken from dead or dying youkai, that he then transfers into dead humans, thus reviving them. The revived humans have yellow eyes and can be used as golems of a sort by Hazel to help him kill youkai. He is shown in a flashback as being a great student and devoted to his master, as his parents are dead. Hazel's behavior and affections (especially his relationship with Gat and love/hate relationship with Sanzo) could be interpreted as homosexual in nature. Hazel struggles with his suppressed youkai nature (the demon Varaharu) and eventually must face his demon head on, while in an encounter with Ukoku. In the Reload Gunlock anime, Hazel has a different origin. He would often kill youkai, and was eventually punished for it by being turned into one himself, which resulted in him killing the priest who raised him. He continued killing youkai but was eventually killed by Gat, under the orders of the Great Spirit. However, Gat feels sorry for Hazel, so he then chooses to revive him by sharing his own life energy, which also gives Hazel's necklace the power to revive dead humans with youkai souls (in the anime, the mirror appears to be able to hold an infinite number of souls). However, Hazel's memories become altered to make him believe that he was the one who killed and revived Gato instead . In the finale of the series, Hazel attempts to kill Sanzo and revive him, in order to get Sanzo to join him in wiping out all demons, but Gojyo, Hakkai and Goku intervene and Gat is fatally injured in the ensuing battle. Before dying, he reveals the truth to Hazel, resulting in Hazel regaining his own true memories. Hazel is then defeated in his youkai form by the Sanzo party, and feeling that he has wasted his life, then asks Sanzo to kill him. Sanzo complies with his request, though before shooting Hazel he comforts him somewhat by telling him that nobody wastes their life. His voice is done by Koichi Tochika and as a child he is voiced by Shinobu Sato in the Japanese version. In the English version he is voiced by Patrick Seitz while his younger self is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. =Gato= Gatti \\"Gat\\" Nenehawk: Hazel's large bodyguard/traveling companion, he wields two Rugar .45s. He fights recklessly for Hazel because he can be instantly brought back to life or healed as long as Hazel has a soul stored in his pendant or there is a corpse nearby to take a soul from. His past is largely unknown except that he met Hazel several years before, was injured by him, but spared. He believes that being with and protecting Hazel is his destiny. He appears to be of Native American descent, and doesn't require sleep or food. He is said by Ukoku Sanzo to have been a young man of a tribe that worships nature and uses firearms. When the demons they had forged peace with attacked, Hazel tried to help. Gato originally opposed him and became the first human Hazel had ever mistakenly killed. He immediately was brought back, but his tribe saw him as an abomination against nature and shunned him. He is cut in half by Ukoku in Reload Volume 10, but not before asking Sanzo to take care of Hazel. There are undertones in Saiyuki which suggest a relationship between Hazel and Gato. In the Reload Gunlock anime, Gato's origin is different. He lived in a native tribe (not stated where) that worshiped a being they called the Great Spirit. A group of hunters eventually came and started killing a large amount of the wildlife. Gato and his tribe tried to stop the hunters but were powerless against their guns. Gato, fatally wounded by a bullet, is revived by the Great Spirit and kills the hunters. He is then taken to Europe where Hazel is killing numerous demons and under the Great Spirit's orders reluctantly kills him (since Hazel was just a boy). Guilty of his actions, Gato asks the Great Spirit to revive Hazel with his life, which the Great Spirit does so, giving Hazel's necklace the ability to revive humans with youkai souls. Gato willing goes along with the charade the Great Spirit created until the finale of the series, where he decides to fight the Sanzo party without Hazel using any souls to revive him. As a result, they kill Gato, but before he dies he reveals the truth about Hazel's memories being altered. In the Japanese version, he is voiced by Rikiya Koyama while in the English version he is voiced by Beau Billingslea. =Homura= Toushin Homura Taishi, a character added into the anime version of Saiyuki GensoMaden mid way into the series and becomes the main antagonist. Homura was stated to be the half-human grandson of the daughter of the King of the gods of Heaven with a human man from Earth (presumably inspired by the Taoist legend of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, involving the goddess Zhinu and her mortal lover Niulang). Although he succeeded Nataku Taishi (who destroyed Gyumaoh-Bull Satan 500 years ago), he eventually grows disgusted with the boring tranquility of the lazy life in Heaven. He had some relationship with Sanzo and his comrades. He calls them by their names from a previous existence. He comes to hate the system in Heaven since he was once romantically involved with a pureblood goddess, but the union between them was forbidden by his own maternal grandfather. As punishment, she was reincarnated on Earth and he was imprisoned in Heaven, in order to prevent a union between them, and she later died of old age while he continued to go on living. He is eager to get Sanzo's Evil Sutra, as his ultimate ambition seemed to be the creation of a perfect world with Son Goku as the catalyst for the creation of a new Heaven and Earth, and but it is shown near the end of Saiyuki Gensomaden, that he was actually looking to be defeated by somebody who is worthy of him, Son Goku—the \\"perfect world\\" being only a place where he could obtain the most honorable and worthy death. His motivation for this is that because he's half god, he would eventually die of old age, and because he was born a warrior god he felt that it was most fitting to die while fighting. He constantly observes the Sanzo party's movements, sometimes sending his underlings to fight them to push them to grow stronger or going to meet them in person (along with his two companions, Shion and Zenion) to do so, which always resulted in him brutally thrashing Goku. Though not truly evil at heart, Homura is nonetheless very ruthless and isn't bothered by sending others out to die, though he doesn't actively seek to kill others. Ultimately he doesn't believe in the existence of good or evil. He considered Zenion and Shion friends and was deeply affected by their deaths. His weapon is a flaming long sword possessing tremendous power. He can wipe out a troop of monsters at one swing. He uses the Power of Spirit, better known as Chi, like Cho Hakkai. He's always seen wearing a pair of handcuffs which serve as his power-limiters, and becomes far stronger when he takes them off. He's killed in the finale the Saiyuki Gensomaden anime by Goku, and at his request he is left to die in his own world. In the manga, Homura makes only a brief appearance in Saiyuki Gaiden, talking with Zenon and Shien. In the original Japanese version he is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa and in the English dub he is voiced by Jason Douglas. =Nataku= Toushin Nataku Taishi only appears in Saiyuki Gaiden and in the anime and briefly in the manga*War Prince Nataku: Nataku is based on the Taoist deity Nezha. He is a half-mortal war god who won the then-divine Son Goku (Sun Wukong)'s friendship, since both golden-eyed boys were branded as \\"heretical\\" beings due to the nature of their births. Unfortunately, Nataku falls into a catatonic state (the reasons for this are not disclosed in the anime) and sits in the divine garden of heaven with only the Goddess of Mercy to keep him company, staring blankly ahead for all time (it is implied by Kanzeon Bosatsu that he is waiting for Goku to return). In the series, Nataku is decidedly more somber than Goku and is resigned to being a puppet to the Gods, He was 'given the honor' of being the War Prince, a role which is later passed onto Homura. The title of \\"war prince\\" is more of a curse then an honor, since whoever has the title repeatedly sent into battle without any regard for their well being. Feared and hated by most of the other gods for being too excessively powerful, a demon to the other gods, and he is shunned as a social misfit and lonely outcast, despite actually being the premier warrior of Heaven's army. In the anime, Nataku goes by a different title than in the manga, but his background is still very much the same - right down to his father (the overambitious and duplicituous Commander Li Touten), and the use of a long spear as a weapon of choice. It is gradually revealed that Li Touten is exploiting his son for fame and recognition from the rest of Heaven, and it is also implied that he is actually using him as tool in order to gain political power and influence among the other gods (reversing the traditional role in mythology that Nataku is actually to blame for his own misfortune). Nataku's father is later confronted by the past reincarnation of Cho Hakkai (Field Marshal Tenpou Gensui), and further mistreatment of his son is then yet to be seen in the series. In the Japanese version, Nataku is voiced by Kaho Koda and in the English dub he is voiced by Tony Oller in the original anime and by Clint Bickham in Gaiden. =Zenon= Zenon comes down with Prince Homura only because he dislikes the evil monsters and spirits. Like Sanzo and Gojyo, he frequently smokes cigarettes and drinks alcohol. His revolving 'Demon Blaster' destroys dozen of monsters. His right eye is covered by a black patch. It is revealed that the eyepatch is his demon limiter, after he became a demon himself after having killed 1000 demons, and he goes berserk when he removes it. His full power in his true form is so great that if he stays in it too long he starts to lose all control of it. Zenon agrees to follow Homura for multiple reasons. One being he is disgusted of both life in Heaven and of living in general, another is that he wants to find the demon who killed his wife and son. Years ago, Zenon went freely between Earth and Heaven (the year was not specified in the anime) as an assassin for the gods. He eventually married a human woman who became pregnant with his son. The other gods found out about this, and Zenon agreed to give up his immortality and just live with his family as a human, since he preferred to live on earth anyway. However, one of his subordinates (who was a youkai), was told to bring his wife (and unborn son) to Heaven, but killed them instead. He kills the demon two episodes after his first appearance, but decides to stick with Homura to the end. He wields a banishing gun like Sanzo, only his has the form of an assault rifle. He dies in battle against Goyjo and Hakkai towards the end of Saiyuki Gensomaden. In the manga, Zenon makes only a brief appearance in Saiyuki Gaiden, talking with Homura and Shien. His voice actors are Jin Horikawa in Japanese and John Swasey in English. =Shien= Shien comes down with Prince Homura for exciting adventures. He never harms anyone unless he has to defend himself. However, once getting in a battle, he is fierce, slaying the opponent with his twin 'Light Whips.' Despite that he nearly always lets the Sanzo party live when he fights them. He previously worked under War Prince Nataku, and wonders what Nataku saw in the human world, after the fight with Gyumaoh, as Nataku told him he wanted to stay longer. A celebration is held every year when he descends to view the scenery Nataku seemed to be most fond of. Despite his calm exterior, he's racked by the guilt that he followed the orders to not help Nataku against Gyumaoh. He wears a hair which later turns out to be a power limiter in his final fight against Hakkai in Saiyuki Gensomaden, where despite Shien's power he's killed by Hakkai when he was aided by Hakuryuu after Hakkai causes Shien to lose focus by playing on the fact that he hides his guilt. In the manga, Shien makes only a brief appearance in Saiyuki Gaiden, talking with Homura and Zenon. In the Japanese version he is voiced by Hiroshi Yanaka and in the English version he is voiced by Spike Spencer. =Zakuro= is a youkai villain who works for Ni Jianyi. He is an illusionist, who manipulates his enemy's mind by having them stare into his eyes. He encounters Sanzo, Hakkai, and Gojyo, and manages trap them within an illusion, but is eventually overpowered and escapes. Goku later finds Zakuro, who had become lost and collapsed due to dehydration and hunger. Goku gives him fruit and leads him to a stream, where they strike up a friendship. The two battle a small band of youkai, after which Zakuro learns of Goku's alliance. The defeated youkai, believing that Zakuro has joined Sanzo's group, leave to relay the news of Zakuro's apparent betrayal. Zakuro departs shortly after, attempting to clear up the mistake. In the animated series, Zakuro is shot by Gat and resurrected by Hazel. Zakuro attempts to shoot Sanzo, but the latter kills him once more. Zakuro is voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi in the Japanese version and his English voice actor is Richard Cansino. Other =Jeep= , known as in the anime (though this version is also displayed in the manga on occasion), is Hakkai's pet dragon. Jeep has the ability to transform into a Jeep that the Sanzo party travel in. Though usually the size of a domestic cat, Jeep's transformation renders him much larger than his usual form. Jeep has also shown the ability to breathe fire. In his past life, he was actually the god Goujun, the Dragon King of the West and a commanding officer (Kenren Taisho's immediate superior) of Heaven's army. He is voiced by Kaoru Morota in Saiyuki, and by Tae Okajima and Eisuke Kotanizawa in Saiyuki Reload and Gunlock. As Goujun, he is voiced by Hiroki Touchi in both Gaiden and Blast. In the English dub his voice effects are done by Kelli Cousins in the original series and by Felecia Angelle in Blast. =Kanzeon Bosatsu= Kanzeon Bosatsu (Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva) aka the Merciful Goddess: The Buddhist bodhisattva Guan Yin. She is portrayed as a hermaphrodite in the manga, while in the anime it gives no indication of her being anything other than a gorgeous older woman. Extremely flirtatious, she actually rarely helps the Sanzo party, usually watching their travels on the way to India from Heaven for her mischievous amusement. She has only once directly intervened, the instance being when Goku's diadem had broken and Sanzo was unconscious and losing blood after sacrificing himself to save Goku from being killed by his childhood friend, the former Talisman Master of the monastery where Sanzo had been raised (who had been corrupted into becoming evil by his very own talismans). In the Japanese versions, she is voiced by Misa Watanabe in the original series and by Rei Igarashi in Reload and Gunlock. She was voiced by Karen Coffer for most episodes and occasionally by Shawn Taylor in the English dub of the first two seasons. In the English versions of Reload and Gunlock, she is voiced by Melodee M. Spevack and in the English version of Gaiden her voice is done by Shelley Calene-Black.

The real-time version is designed for computer, video games, and other simulation needs by attempting to simulate physical real-world systems. Unlike traditional realtime simulation engines, which tend to be based on rigid body kinematics, the use of finite element analysis (FEA) allows DMM to simulate a large set of physical properties. Developers can assign physical properties to a given object or portion of an object, which allow the object to behave as it would in the real world (ice, gummy bear, etc.). In addition, the properties of objects or parts of objects can be changed at runtime, allowing for additional interesting effects. DMM can be authored or used in Maya or 3ds Max to create simulation-based visual effects. Academy Award In 2015 three of the key architects behind DMM, James F. O'Brien, Eric Parker, and Ben Cole, were recognized for their work on DMM with an Academy Award.http://www.oscars.org/news/21-scientific-and-technical-achievements-be- honored-academy-awardsr The citation for the award reads: To Ben Cole for the design of the Kali Destruction System, to Eric Parker for the development of the Digital Molecular Matter toolkit, and to James O’Brien for his influential research on the finite element methods that served as a foundation for these tools. The combined innovations in Kali and DMM provide artists with an intuitive, art-directable system for the creation of scalable and realistic fracture and deformation simulations. These tools established finite element methods as a new reference point for believable on-screen destruction.'' Platform availability DMM is available and optimized for Microsoft's Windows, Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 3, Apple's Mac OS X, and Linux. Function DMM is a physical simulation system which models the material properties of objects allowing them to break and bend in accordance to the stress placed on them. Structures modeled with DMM can break and bend if they are not physically viable. Objects made of glass, steel, stone and jelly are all possible to create and simulate in real-time with DMM. The system accomplishes this by running a finite element simulation that computes how the materials would actually behave. Use DMM has been used in LucasArts's Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, and was used again for Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II.http://www.nowgamer.com/previews/xbox-360/1006/star-wars-the- force-unleashed-2?o=1#listing Plugins for Autodesk Media & Entertainment's 3ds Max and Maya animation software are also available.

From 2005 through 2008, Pixelux's real-time version of DMM technology was exclusive to LucasArts Entertainment as a part of the Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (TFU) project. The FEM system in DMM utilized an algorithm for fracture and deformation developed by University of California, Berkeley professor, James F. O'Brien, as part of his Ph.D. thesis. O'Brien then worked with a development team led by Pixelux CTO, Eric Parker, to develop code suitable for visual effects work and real-time applications. The DMM tools pipeline was designed and implemented by a team led by Mitchell Bunnell, the CEO of Pixelux. An ARM version of DMM was incorporated by Pixelux into their DMM Touch iPhone/iPad product. A version of the DMM Plug-In is included by Autodesk in their release of Maya 2012. The DMM Plug-In runs on all versions of Maya on all platforms in both 32 and 64-bit mode. = Technical Citations = The following technical papers describe the algorithms that DMM is based on and some of the technical details of its implementation: * Eric G.

It stars Laurence Naismith, Lynne Frederick, Garry Miller, Rosalyn Landor, Marc Granger, Diana Dors, Madeline Smith, and James Villiers. Plot The film begins in 1918, where a war widow, Mrs. Allen (Dorothy Alison) and her children, Lucy (Lynne Frederick), Jamie (Garry Miller) and baby Benjamin are reduced to living in a squalid, Camden Town flat. Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors. The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, who has been dead for a hundred years, the present Mr. Blunden being his great-grandson. After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger). They are two children who lived in the house a century earlier. Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their dissolute and hapless Uncle Bertie (James Villiers) and the solicitor Mr. Blunden, until Georgie comes of age. Bertie marries a music hall performer, Bella Wickens (Madeline Smith) and her parents then move into Langley Park, ostensibly as the housekeeper and game keeper. The children come to suspect that Mrs. Wickens (Diana Dors) and her disturbed (and often violent) husband (David Lodge) are plotting to kill them to get hold of Georgie's inheritance. Sara and Georgie find a book with instructions for travelling through time, so that they can get help. Lucy and Jamie agree to travel back with them; they arrange to meet Sara the next day. Jamie searches the graveyard, in the hope of finding nothing and being able to go back to help, knowing in advance that they will succeed. He and Lucy are shocked and distressed to find a gravestone marked with the names of both Sara and Georgie. The sexton explains that the two children died in a fire, whose anniversary turns out to be exactly a hundred years ago tomorrow. Nevertheless, Lucy and Jamie still drink the potion and travel back to 1818 in the hope of preventing the tragedy. There they meet Thomas, the gardener (Stuart Lock), who believes they are from America, and tells Lucy and Jamie that he wants to go there one day and make his fortune. Mr. Blunden is visiting the house that night, but refuses to listen to Sara's pleas for help. That night the children are locked in a room above the library, and given a sleeping potion. Mr. Wickens starts a fire in the library, trapping the children. Jamie helps Tom to save Sara, but when he tries to return for Georgie, he finds himself unable to get through the flames. Mr. Blunden appears, and tells Jamie that they will go together, holding hands. Jamie is kept safe from the fire, but Mr. Blunden suffers the pain that Jamie would have felt. Jamie and Mr. Blunden save Georgie, with Blunden perishing in the fire as the staircase gives way, a serene smile on his face. The Wickens perish in the fire. Lucy and Jamie both return to 1918, but Jamie is unconscious and Lucy cannot tell their mother what has happened. At the graveyard, Lucy discovers that the children's gravestone has been replaced by another: that of Frederick Percival Blunden, the \\"Good Shepherd\\" who \\"died to save the children in his care\\". Jamie soon awakes and is overjoyed to hear that they have succeeded. Shortly after, the lawyer, Mr. Clutterbuck (Graham Crowden), visits them and informs them that recently discovered documents show that Sara Latimer married Thomas and that their great-grandson was the late Mr. Allen. This makes Jamie the rightful heir to the Langley Park. At the end a car pulls up. When Mr Clutterbuck opens the door, sitting inside is Mr Blunden! But which one? The enigmatic phrase he greets them with is one they recognise from their first encounter. They have all the answers they need. The film ends with the cast saying goodbye to the audience one by one as their names are shown on-screen.

She had been cast in the film but shortly before production began she was forced to withdraw from the film due to personal problems that she was dealing with at the time and Lynne Frederick replaced her. Rosalyn Landor and Lynne Frederick had both just come off of auditioning and being turned down for the role of Alice in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland (1972) before being cast in this film. Diana Dors had a key support role. Spike Milligan, Gert Fröbe, Gene Wilder, David Niven, Michael Gough, David Tomlinson, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Donald Pleasence and Robert Helpmann were all considered for the role of Mr. Blunden. =Filming= The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in 1971 with location filming around the village and church at Hedgerley, Buckinghamshire. The fire-ravaged derelict stately home was in fact Heatherden Hall, on the estate of which the studios are located and which at that time served as administration offices for the production facilities. The film was passed uncut by the British Board of Film Censors (now BBFC), with a U rating (Suitable for children). Awards Lynne Frederick won the Evening Standard British Film Award for \\"Best New Coming Actress\\" in 1973 in part for her work on this film.

Geography Gammelin is located between the town of Hagenow to the south and the state capital of Schwerin to the north. The A24 motorway (Bundesautobahn 24) runs south of the village approximately 2.5 kilometers away and the B321 main road (Bundesstraße 321) runs approximately 3 kilometers to the east. History Gammelin is first listed in a document from 1219 as Chemelin; the village church is mentioned in records as early as 1335. During the thirty years war the population suffered. However, the end of the Second World War brought evacuees to the village, displaced people and the rural poor peasants who were allocated land during agrarian reforms. This land was compulsorily collectively farmed, in much the same as land was organized in the DDR. The coat of arms was approved by the interior minister on 21 August 1997, and was registered as number 135 on the MV coat of arms roll. The coat of arms was designed by Manfred Sturzenbecher. Community Predominantly activities within the municipality take place in the district of Gammelin. The sportsclub (Gammelin Wild Ducks) meet here, in addition to the village club which regularly organizes events. The district's elderly also meet in Gammelin's parish house for coffee and cake.

Since the university was founded by King Charles IV in 1348, the studium generale was divided among Bohemian (including German-speaking inhabitants), Bavarian, Saxon, and Polish \\"nations\\". From 1403 onwards, the religious Lollard movement and the doctrines of the Oxford theologian John Wycliffe led to controversy at the Prague University. The Bohemian reformers around Jan Hus wanted to teach this new doctrine, but most German masters and professors voted against the new \\"heretic\\" thinking. German students leaving Prague for Leipzig (postcard, ) In anticipation of the Council of Pisa, the three \\"foreign\\" nations (Poland, Bavaria and Saxony) at the university opposed the request of Wenceslaus to take a neutral attitude between the two rival popes in the Western Schism. Wenceslaus himself hoped for support of a new Pope to regain the German kingship after his deposition by Rupert of the Palatinate nine years before. However, King Rupert, relying on the support of Pope Gregory XII and the Prague archbishop Zbyněk Zajíc of Hazmburk, pressured German teachers and students not to side with his Bohemian rival. A delegation led by Jerome of Prague went to Wenceslaus' court staying at the royal city of Kutná Hora (according to other sources at Točník Castle), where the king promised to change the constitution of the university. On 18 January 1409, he had the statutes amended: with his decree, he gave the Bohemian nation three votes and one vote each to the other three nations. Shortly after that, Hus himself became rector of the university, succeeding Johannes Hoffmann von Schweidnitz. As another result of the Decree of Kutná Hora, numerous German academics (about 80 percent of the teaching staff) and their students left the university. This exodus resulted in the foundation of the University of Leipzig in the Margravate of Meissen, among others, and led to a considerable isolation of the Prague university. In 1417 the university officially adopted the Hussite confession and henceforth, Utraquist scholars taught and studied here. The rising influence of this doctrine and the execution of Jan Hus in 1415 culminated in the outbreak of the Hussite Wars.

It has around 700 pupils aged 11–16. Description When it visited in 2016, Ofsted found a 'Outstanding' 11-16 secondary school, its predecessor school, Hethersett High School and Science College, had been judged inadequate following an inspection in March 2013, requiring it to become an academy. The academy opened in November 2013 under the sponsorship of the Inspiration Trust and the current principal was installed. Most pupils are 'White British', with a smaller than average proportion coming from minority ethnic backgrounds. A smaller than average proportion of pupils speak English as an additional language, or are in care or receiving free school meals. In March 2013 Hethersett High School and Science College had been put in special measures. It was one of 28 Norfolk schools targeted by Ofsted in a bid to discover why so many were failing to deliver good outcomes for their pupils. The visiting inspectors said \\" students’ achievement was not good enough, leaders and management had failed to spot youngsters’ underachievement quickly enough and the quality of teaching was inconsistent and often did not challenge pupils enough. ... The decline in the quality of education provided by the school indicates that capacity for improvement is inadequate.\\" while acknowledging that students were well cared for and felt safe at school and attendance was above average. Parents however were positive about the school’s work. On 2 December 2014 there were still concerns about the behaviour of the pupils, and Ofsted did a monitoring visit. They advised management to put more emphasis on low-level disruption in lessons being covered by temporary supply staff, praised them for the new system of compulsory after school sessions- saying these worked when they had been well planned and fostered discontent when they were unstructured.

It is commonly known as bird of paradise, but it is not related to the bird of paradise genus Strelitzia. It grows to 1–4 m tall, depending on rainfall. The leaves are bipinnate, 10–15 cm long, bearing 3-10 pairs of pinnae, each with 6-10 pairs of leaflets 5–6 mm long and 2–4 mm broad. The flowers are borne in racemes up to 20 cm long, each flower with five yellow petals with 10 long conspicuous red stamens. The pods are densely covered in short, red glandular hairs. It is a striking ornamental plant native to South America, mainly Argentina and Uruguay. It is naturalized in Texas, and fairly common in the rest of the southwestern United States, where it is known as bird of paradise bush, desert bird of paradise, yellow bird of paradise, and barba de chivo. Although it is a tropical plant adapted to dry climate, it also thrives in the climate of Avsa and neighboring islands in the south of Sea of Marmara in northwestern Turkey, where it is commonly known as Paşabıyığı (Pasabiyigi), Cennetkuşu ağacı (Cennetkusu agaci), which in Turkish means \\"bird of paradise tree,\\" and Bodurakasya, which means \\"dwarf acacia\\".

He was energetically involved in civil wars in western Georgian polities, which he sought to bring under his sway. He was killed in battle while trying to recover the lost throne of Imereti.  Accession  Giorgi was the eldest son of Kaikhosro I, Prince-regnant of Guria. After the assassination of his father, Giorgi and his brother Malakia fled to the protection of the Ottoman pasha of Akhaltsikhe, whose help he exploiting in securing the princely throne of Guria after the death of Demetre Gurieli in 1668. According to the 18th- century Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti Giorgi was \\"powerful, brave, superb warrior, godless, bloodthirsty, and a merciless slave-trader\\". He successfully fought the piratical Abkhaz who raided the coast of Guria on more than one occasion.  Conflicts in Imereti and Mingrelia  In 1672, Giorgi, with an extravagant bribe, bought the pasha's support against King Bagrat V of Imereti, with an eye on the king's beautiful wife Tamar, whom Gurieli admired as claimed by Prince Vakhushti. Bagrat was defeated by the allies at Kutaisi and made a prisoner, but released after the pasha extracted a greater bribe from him and became convinced that taking the fortress of Kvara—where Tamar had taken refuge—was a futile endeavor. Bagrat promptly avenged Gurieli, attacking and looting Guria that same year. Eventually, the two men reconciled; Giorgi married Bagrat's daughter Darejan in 1674 and offered him a shelter when Bagrat was deposed in favor of Archil, son of Vakhtang V of Kartli, in 1678. Archil, further, restored Bagrat's wife Tamar, an Imeretian femme fatale, to her previous husband Levan III Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. Gurieli invoked his ties with the Ottoman government; the pasha of Erzurum arrived with troops and helped Bagrat reclaim his crown and wife in 1679. The defeated Dadiani managed to retain his principality at the expense of surrendering his only heir Manuchar as a hostage to Giorgi Gurieli. On Levan's death in 1680, Gurieli's claim to Dadiani's succession was rejected by the Mingrelians. Giorgi then executed Manuchar and attempted to seize Mingrelia by force, but failed.  King of Imereti  King Bagrat's death in 1681 provided Giorgi Gurieli with an opportunity to claim the long-coveted Imeretian crown and Queen Tamar for himself. As Bagrat's only surviving heir Alexander, a natural son by a concubine, was held as a hostage in Kartli, Giorgi Gurieli was installed by the Imeretian nobles as their king. He then divorced his child-bride Darejan and illegally married his mother-in-law Tamar. That same year, Giorgi made another attempt to seize Mingrelia, but the Mingrelian magnate Giorgi Lipartiani foiled his designs and installed the late Levan Dadiani's namesake natural son. The incestuous king quickly lost support among the Imeretians. In 1683, at their request, the pasha of Akhaltsikhe convinced King Giorgi XI of Kartli to release Bagrat the Blind's son Alexander from custody and secured the sultan's approval for his enthronement in Imereti. Giorgi Gurieli was forced to retire to Guria. Next year, he mounted a revolt of nobility against Alexander, involving Shoshita, Duke of Racha, Princes Lordkipanidze and Chijavadze, the nobles of Lechkhumi, and Giorgi Lipartiani, regent of Mingrelia. Gurieli arrived with his troops in Imereti and looted the venerated icon of the Theotokos of Blachernae. Alexander found major support in the princes Abashidze, notably Paata Abashidze, and Mikeladze. At the bloody battle of Rokiti, Gurieli was defeated and killed. His sons fled to Akhaltsikhe, while his brother Malakia was made Prince of Guria by the victorious king Alexander.  Family  Giorgi Gurieli was married three times. He wed Princess Tamar, née Chijavadze, in 1667 and divorced her in 1677 to marry Darejan, daughter of King Bagrat V of Imereti and Queen Tamar, daughter of Constantine I, Prince of Mukhrani. Tamar Chijavadze later remarried Prince Katsia Chikovani and then Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze. In 1681, Giorgi married his own mother-in-law Queen Tamar. All of Giorgi's children were born of his first marriage to Tamar Chijavadze: * Prince Kaikhosro II Gurieli (1669–1689), Prince of Guria (1685–1689); * Prince Mamia III Gurieli (died 1714), Prince of Guria (1689–1714); * Prince Malakia; * Prince Otia; * Princess N., probably Tamar, the second wife of Simon of Imereti.

It was relocated and flooded to build the Kensico Reservoir, one of the central storage reservoirs for the New York City Reservoir system. Neighboring towns and hamlets included North Castle, Mount Pleasant, Chappaqua, Valhalla, Armonk, and White Plains. History Kensico was named after the Siwanoy Indian chief, Coken-se-co, a signatory of the deed for the city of White Plains. Prior to the town being flooded and removed from existence, Kensico was a stop on the Harlem Line out of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, shortly north of the White Plains stop. It was also one of three settlements in the area, Kenisco, Wright's Mills, and Davis Brook. In 1845, residents of Kensico, about 2.5 miles away from Davis Brook, successfully appealed to change the name of the railroad station at Davis Brook to Kensico. The hamlet, located in a valley between two larger mountains, featured a large red mill in its center, portions of the Bronx and Byram Rivers, and a Methodist Episcopal church. Despite being a sleepy farming village in Westchester, the town had some reputation for quirky controversy. In 1882, storeowner Albert Montfort was found murdered in his store, the apparent weapon an axe, and his murderer was never found.NY Times, Sept. 6th, 1882 On June 16, 1884, four intoxicated workers from the new dam entered the Joseph Reed Hotel and assaulted the bartender - two were arrested and two escaped after returning to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. On November 6, 1884, farmer John Donnelly died from mysterious injuries he obtained after a day of drunken carousing, his injuries presumably inflicted by a group of highwaymen who attacked him for unclear reasons. Initial construction of the Kensico Dam began in 1881, however, plans were expanded which ultimately required the annexation of all of the land in the town. Property from the entire town was purchased for approximately $92,000, with the largest award of $24,000 being paid to the estate of Joseph Warren Tompkins for the destruction of his mill. Mr. Frank Tilford was paid $19,135 for the destruction of his stock and dairy farm on Big Rye Pond. The Westchester Ice Company was compensated $9,592 for the destruction of their facilities in Kensico. Compensation for the property was overseen by lawyer Henry T. Dykman. Some protests were seen as the town was cleared for the reservoir. On April 1, 1893, hotel owner William Ackerly (owner of the Brookside Hotel) protested the mandatory evacuation by refusing to leave his property. Lawyer Henry Dykman, Sheriff John Duffy, and Deputy Sheriff John Verplank then proceeded to remove Mr. Ackerly's belongings, leaving them outside.

The domain was administered from Wakayama Castle in present-day Wakayama, Wakayama Prefecture. The heads of the domain were drawn from the Kishu-Tokugawa clan, one of the Gosanke, or three branches of the Tokugawa clan.

Participant observation involves a researcher joining the group he or she is studying, and in the case of covert observation, the researcher's status is not made known to the group. Covert participant observation involves the researcher's identity not being revealed in a research for instance a secret agent can perform his/her drug abuse investigation on drug abuse suspects by becoming part of them inorder to catch the culprits whilst being under cover Observation involves participating in activities over a period of time and therefore becoming an accepted part of the group. An example is the research for A Glasgow Gang Observed. A 26-year-old schoolmaster at a Scottish Reformatory (ListD) school, who called himself James Patrick, went undercover with the help of one of his pupils to study the often violent behaviour of the teenagers in a gang in Glasgow. He concealed all his personal information for his own safety. Advantages and disadvantages A practical advantage of the method is that no prior knowledge of social incidence is required. On the other hand, it could be difficult to gain access and maintain cover in the group. Another disadvantage is the potential difficulty of taking part in the activity and observing simultaneously. In A Glasgow Gang Observed James Patrick would have taken part in the deviant behaviour he was studying. An ethical disadvantage is that the researcher has to deceive the group and invade their privacy; and this could end in mental or physical harm. There is a validity advantage since the researcher is more likely to observe natural behaviour representative of a small social group. However, the method is unlikely to get consistent or comparable results on a large scale, since the data gathered is qualitative and there is variation in group dynamics of different small groups.

It has a population of 1,665 (2019) and lies in the historical region of Těšín Silesia.  History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Sedlicz. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a tithe from was not yet precised). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deaconry as Czedlicz. It is now served by a wooden All Saints Church, an important landmark in the village. In 1573 it was sold as one of 16 villages and the town of Friedeck and formed a state country split from the Duchy of Teschen. After World War I and fall of Austria-Hungary it became a part of Czechoslovakia. In March 1939 it became a part of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. After World War II it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

On 'Mythos' the band realized a mixture of art rock and psychedelic with oriental influences in lengthy pieces. Stephan Kaske played the melody from Händel's 'Fireworks Music' on the flute in a rock-meets-classical version. 'Oriental Journey-Hero's Death' creates a psychedelic mood with sitar and mellotron sounds. 'Encyclopedia Terrae', which takes up the entire second side, is regarded as the highlight of the album and features powerful drums meeting up with peaceful sequences, sounds of warfare such as detonating bombs and marching soldiers meeting up with hard guitar riffs. This debut album instantly became a classic in the Krautrock-genre.

Its origin is strongly related to that of the arms of the Crown of Aragon. It is considered by heraldists and by the government of Catalonia to be originally the familiar arms of the Counts of Barcelona, and it was adopted by the descendants of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona as Kings of Aragon. Several authors strongly dispute the origin of coat and consider the arms to always have been those of the Kings of Aragon. It is one of the oldest coats of arms in Europe dating back in a seal of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona from 1150.

Reign  A natural son of Bagrat V of Imereti, he was a political hostage at the eastern Georgian court of George XI of Kartli at the death of his father in 1681. Giorgi III Gurieli, Prince of Guria, capitalized on the vacuum of power in Imereti, and seized the crown the same year. However, George XI and the Imeretian nobles secured the Ottoman recognition for Alexander, who was enthroned in Imereti after deposing Prince Gurieli in 1683. Alexander married off his sister Darejan to his powerful vassal Paata Abashidze, lord of Upper Imereti, and succeeding in crushing the aristocratic opposition led by Prince Gurieli in 1684. In order to get rid of the Ottoman hegemony, Alexander transferred his loyalty to the Safavid shah Suleiman I of Persia in 1689, but was expelled by the Turks into Kartli in August 1690. In 1691, through the mediation of Erekle I of Kartli and the Persian government, Alexander was restored in Imereti after a year of anarchy and misrule, only to be dethroned by the nobles led by his own father-in-law Prince Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze. The leaders of the coup delivered Alexander to the anti-Persian king of Kartli, George XI, who had him executed and buried at the Ruisi church in 1695.  Family Alexander married, in 1691, Tamar (1681–1716), daughter of Prince Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze. Prior to that, he lived in an unofficial union with a certain noblewoman (Nino Gurieli, according to Cyril Toumanoff), who bore him two sons, Simon and George. Alexander also had two daughters, probably born by Abashidze: * Simon (died 1701) was King of Imereti from 1699 to 1701. * George VII (died 1720) was King of Imereti, with intermissions, from 1707 to 1720. * A daughter (died 1720), who was married to Prince Bezhan Tsereteli (died 1680). * A daughter (fl. 1709), who was married to Shoshita III, Duke of Racha (died 1729).

She began her music career in 1996 with girl punk band Period Pains, she sings in the British new prog rock group Pure Reason Revolution and has also been half of the British rock duo Tiny Giant. Her solo release, \\"Juno\\", featured on the original motion picture soundtrack to Maniac (2012 film). Another solo release, \\"True Love\\", is the title track to the American supernatural horror film Amityville: The Awakening. Biography =Period Pains= Born September 13, 1981, from the age of 13, Alper fronted the cult Riot grrrl punk band Period Pains, based in Reading. The band formed in 1995 with Alper on vocals, Felicity Aldridge on guitar, Laura Warwick on bass and Laura Viney on drums. Viney was later replaced by Magdalena (Magda) Przybylski. Their 1997 anti-Spice Girls single, \\"Spice Girls (Who Do YOU Think You Are?)\\", was released on Damaged Goods. The disc received airplay from John Peel, for whom they later recorded a session which was later released as an EP. The band were highlighted by John Peel in his Festive 50 for 1997. The band were covered by publications including The Daily Mail and Just 17 but only played a few live shows, notably opening in the Dr Martens tent for the 1997 Reading Festival. =Pure Reason Revolution= Alper performing with Pure Reason RevolutionAlper then joined Reading-based band The Sunset Sound, which eventually became Pure Reason Revolution, contributing vocals, picking up the bass guitar later after the previous bassist left. Alper also plays keyboards, including a midi sample-triggering keyboard during live performances. In shows in 2010 and 2011 she also played an Epiphone SG guitar on certain tracks. The band signed to Alan McGee's Poptones label for a one-off release of \\"Apprentice of the Universe\\", which peaked at number 12 in the indie charts. Signing to SonyBMG in autumn 2004, the following year saw Pure Reason Revolution releasing two singles and one mini-album, followed by the full-length debut The Dark Third in 2006, with producer Paul Northfield. During this time, PRR supported Mew, Hope of the States, Porcupine Tree, Secret Machines and Oceansize, as well as headlining their own gigs, and recorded sessions for Mark Radcliffe's BBC Radio 2 show and XFM. The band's second album Amor Vincit Omnia was released in March 2009 on Superball Music, and accompanied by an extensive headline tour of Britain and Europe. The band were track of the week on Kerrang! Radio and track of the day in Classic Rock Magazine. The new music was darker and more electronic than previous offerings, qualities that were largely retained for 2010's third studio album, Hammer and Anvil, also released via Superball. Hammer and Anvil opens with a track sung exclusively by Alper, Fight Fire, which received lengthy airtime on XFM and other radio stations. Pure Reason Revolution split on good terms in November 2011, with members choosing to pursue other projects. A final series of concerts in the UK saw the Dark Third album played in full for the first time. A final EP entitled Valour was also released as a download-only in conjunction with the break up, with proceeds donated to charity. Alper in 2010 The band with Alper re-united in 2019. =Solo releases= In 2013, Alper began work on a solo project for which she recorded songs in collaboration with Tom Bellamy (of The Cooper Temple Clause and Losers), who worked on Pure Reason Revolution's final album, Hammer and Anvil) and Robin Coudert (of Phoenix). \\"Juno\\", written by Alper and Coudert, is featured on the original motion picture soundtrack to the 2013 film Maniac. =Tiny Giant= In 2015 Alper announced she had formed a new band – Tiny Giant – with her co-writer; the Grammy and MOBO nominated multi- instrumentalist Mat Collis. Their first single \\"Joely\\" was released on 9 May 2016 which won them a nomination for the Limelight (New Band) award at the Progressive Music Awards Eon Music. They released a further three singles, School of Hard Knocks, Draw me a Line and Thirsty & Sad. A leaked album track soundtracked Vanity Fair's \\"Playhouse Presents\\" series for Sky Arts Artist Alper is also a designer and artist. She designed the cover-slip for Pure Reason Revolution's single entitled \\"Victorious Cupid\\" that was distributed at tours in 2006 and 2007 to accommodate the free Myspace download, which has since become a collector's item. She also designed the cover art for the official \\"Victorious Cupid\\" EP release on ORG records in 2008. Recently, she designed the artwork for Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison's 2007 collaboration with 05Ric, Drop. Alper also designed the album artwork for Pure Reason Revolution's 2009 release, Amor Vincit Omnia. The sleeve contained a 16-page booklet which included 12 pieces of her work. Some limited edition numbered prints of these plates were made available on her website in early 2009. DJ Alper often performs under the pseudonym 'Chloe Ramone'.

It was formerly an Arndale Centre, until it was purchased by Capital & Regional in January 2006. It was temporarily called The Mall Arndale, but is now referred to as The Mall Luton, although local people still refer to it as \\"The Arndale\\". History Originally opened in 1972, as The Arndale Shopping Centre, it was purchased by Capital & Regional in January 2006. The centre has 128 shop units occupying , and parking for 1,707 cars. The area that would become the new shopping centre was cleared during the 1960s. Many notable buildings which had escaped the damage of World War II were subsequently demolished. =St George's Square= Luton Mall at Night Following the completion of the redevelopment of St George's Square in Luton, the St George's Square end of The Mall Luton was also remodelled. The development created 8,825 sq m (75,000 sq ft) of new retail space across 8 new retail units. Three levels of car parking at the top of the development provided an increase of approximately 200 car parking spaces. On completion The Mall Luton totalled 77,199 sq m (831,000 sq ft). The new six-storey building has an entrance directly onto St George's Square, with escalators inside the building taking shoppers to the main mall level. Ken Ford, chief executive of The Mall, said, when the scheme was announced: > \\"Our proposals will provide enhanced retail units in order to improve the > retail offer in the town. They will also improve The Mall Luton's > relationship with the town – by providing bright, modern shop fronts and a > landmark new entrance we will vastly improve the Mall's presence onto St > George's Square and help create an attractive area for the people of Luton > to shop, eat and relax.\\" TK Maxx was the new anchor tenant for the extension, with Argos also taking a unit. Completion of the St George's Square redevelopment was planned for September 2009. However, due to the recession, the funding was delayed. The redevelopment was eventually completed in 2012. Extension plans =The Northern Gateway= In December 2007, a further planning application was submitted for a much larger extension to The Mall.https://www.propertyweek.com/the-mall-fund-submits-luton-arndale- plans/3074779.article As well as several much larger shopping units, housing and office space was planned. The site is between The Mall and train station, and would see total redevelopment of Silver Street, Bute Street, one side of Cheapside and Part of Guildford Street. Although much of the site is either car parking or vacant, two grade II listed buildings and several locally listed buildings would be demolished, including several 19th century hat factories, for which the town was once famous.Luton Today article on proposed demolition The plan was criticised by English Heritage and the Victorian Society.http://www.victorian- society.org.uk/news/8986/hat_trick_of_destruction_planned_for_lutons_historic_heart.html Victorian Society Following the comments The Mall stated that following discussions with council officers, \\"amendments to the application are being made\\".

He was a lodger of Minnie Caldwell's in the 1960s, and her nickname for him was \\"Sunny Jim\\". He made a reappearance after an absence of 42 years, only to tangle with local villain Tony Gordon. Cope also appeared in the 1988 special Minnie Caldwell Remembered. Storylines Jed served time in a borstal in Manchester in 1960. He first appeared in April 1961 to see if his friend Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie), who he had met in borstal would help him on a job - of dubious legality - but Dennis wasn't into that sort of thing any more and turned him down. He returned on 13 September ( the same day as Ida Barlow's funeral), reformed but unemployed, to find legitimate work with Dennis' help. Dennis was promoted at the Orinoco club and managed to get Jed his old job. Jed was a regular fixture in the street from then on and became best friends with Dennis, Christine Hardman and Jean Stark, who he briefly dated. After some time away, Jed reappeared in November 1962, as Dennis had told him he would be able to lodge at No.11, but Dennis' mother Elsie wasn't having it. A sympathetic Minnie Caldwell let him live with her at No.5. Having finished at the Orinocco, he made money by doing odd jobs for friends and trying out the occasional business idea, including selling wash basins, waxwork dummies, operating a market stall and working in an auction room. Whatever the job, they were always short-term and he never earned a lot. He was initially intended to be a somewhat nefarious character, but during an argument with Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), actor Kenneth Cope thought the cameras had stopped rolling and said, \\"Give us a kiss!\\" The line was kept in, and Jed became a more lighthearted figure, running various schemes while helping Minnie out when he could. He became known for his trademark flat cap, which he even wore during a bed scene. Jed was arrested on Minnie's birthday in 1966 and sentenced to nine months in prison for stealing blankets. Jed returned on 8 August 2008, wearing his cap and holding a cat (as Minnie had always held her cat) named Sonny Jim. Landlord Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) barged into Jed's home, but he refused Tony's attempts to persuade him to move out by saying he'd lived there for 40 years and in spite of his health problems, he was still more of a man than Tony. Ten days later, Tony returned in an attempt to buy Jed out of the flat. Tony returned a few hours later, and Jed suffered a heart attack. Tony delayed calling the ambulance, instead calling Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) who was helping to develop the flats. He then told the paramedics that Jed had been ready to sign the papers before he collapsed. He left Jed's cat on the streets to fend for itself. Jed was last seen in the hospital when Tony informed him of clearing the house out and said some harsh words to Mr. Stone, Jed then began to cry in turmoil over losing his cat and home. On 17 November 2008, Emily Bishop met him while working in the canteen at Weatherfield General and recognised him from his time on the street and later invited him to move in with her and Norris Cole. His nemesis Tony was stunned to see him on the Street and the pair clashed, with Jed demanding that Tony give him money for having ruined his life. In December 2008, he paid Maria Connor a visit; he told her all about his experience at the hands of Tony and supported her strong suspicions that Tony had killed her husband Liam. Jed became more suspicious when he later saw Tony talking with Jimmy Dockerson. Tony tried to bribe Jed with a sum of money in the ginnel which Jed accepted but he assured Tony that he wouldn't get rid of him that easily. On Christmas Eve 2008, Jed paid Tony a visit in the Underworld factory, ordering money for evicting him from his home, and continually accused him of Liam's murder. Tony eventually strangled Jed with a piece of lingerie, a gift he had planned to give to his wife, Carla (Alison King). He then loaded Jed's lifeless body into a hamper, before covering it with party decorations for a party with the factory girls, who were oblivious to the situation. Tony returned to the factory on Christmas Day to dispose of Jed's body, only to discover that Jed was still alive in the hamper. He then bound and gagged Jed; Tony then offered him a new apartment, which was rent-free and he would also get £3,000 to help get him started. Jed agreed to this and Tony drove of with Jed in the back of his van. Later in the episode, Tony was seen cleaning the back of the van, which made people speculate that Jed may have been murdered by Tony. This later would be proven wrong though. On 23 January Tony told Maria that he had killed Jed on Christmas Eve, rather than merely rendering him unconscious. She proceeded to tell everyone in the Rovers what he told her, but no-one believed her. On 28 January 2009, Tony Gordon arranged for Jed to return to the street to discredit Maria's accusations. Jed followed Tony's instructions to tell everyone that he'd been living in Wigan for the past weeks. After \\"outstaying his welcome\\" as Tony put it, Tony hurried him outside. Carla followed, and became suspicious by the angry words exchanged as Tony pushed him into a Wigan-bound cab with Jed's cat which Emily had found & looked after for him. Carla began to get suspicious of Tony, so she decided to visit Jed. They went out for something to eat and Carla told Jed she found out what Tony had done to him. Jed begged Carla not to tell Tony about the visit and she promised not to. When she discovered the marks on his neck, she asked him what happened but Jed got upset and ran off. When Carla confronted him about the mark on the old man's neck, Tony claimed Jed had attempted suicide. Then with more lies, Tony said he had given Jed a home because he felt sorry for him and guilty that he had pushed Jed so far. Tony then phoned Jimmy and sent him to sort Jed out. When Jed returned to his flat, Jimmy confronted Jed and warned him not to tell Carla or anyone. Jed was shocked and upset by the threat. Carla later found out from Emily that Jed had another heart attack and was back in hospital. Development Jed Stone in the 1960s. Kenneth Cope made his first appearance as Jed Stone in April 1961, which was originally intended to be a one-off. But Kenneth Cope impressed the producers, and was brought back in September that year. Due to an Equity strike, Kenneth Cope couldn't return to the series until 1962, so was absent for a year. Jed Stone appeared for 4 more months from November 1962 to March 1963, and was reintroduced for the best part of 1966. In 2008, plans were made for increasingly villainous Tony Gordon to menace a pensioner named Mr. Gamble. Casting director June West suggested they bring Jed Stone back instead, initially for four episodes. Later that year Jed was brought back once again, However he was written out a month later when the character was nearly killed off by Tony Gordon. He reappeared again the following month for 3 episodes. Jed Stone was last seen on 2 February 2009. According to Cope, the producers had no desire to continue using the character after Tony Gordon's death. In other media In 1988, after the death of actress Margot Bryant, Kenneth Cope hosted the special Minnie Caldwell Remembered. Wearing Jed's flat cap, he knocked on the front door where Minnie had once lived, and called out for \\"Ma\\". He then weaved in and out of character as he mentioned Bryant's passing. Interspersed with flashbacks of Minnie's time with Jed and other characters were interviews with Bryant's co-stars such as Doris Speed, Lynne Carol, and Eileen Derbyshire.

The Practice has been awarded over 40 national awards for buildings it has designed and was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize in 1998 for the Quay Bar, Castlefield and again in 2013 for Chetham's School of Music. It has received acclaim for the way he has dealt with new uses in terms of the historical context found in most British cities. As a recognition to his services to architecture, Stephenson was appointed an OBE in the Birthday Honour's List of 2001. Upon learning of his award he stated \\"I was very surprised to get this award. A fine artist can paint a painting on his own, but an architect can't design a building on his own. I feel honoured, but it's a team effort\\". Stephenson has held a number of external positions; he was a visiting professor and external examiner at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, external examiner at Newcastle University, a Civic Trust assessor, jury chairman for the RIBA Awards and was an RIBA national councillor. He was a member of the CABE national design panel for 6 years and Chairman of RIBA North West. To relax Stephenson enjoys travel, music and reading.

Chemistry PiPT is short for N-propyl-N-isopropyl- tryptamine. PiPT is a tryptamine, which all belong to a larger family of compounds known as indolethylamines. PiPT is closely related to the compounds DPT and DiPT. Dosage PiPT is reported as being active at doses of 50-100mg orally, or 25mg smoked. Effects Very little is known about the psychopharmacological properties of PiPT, but reports suggest it produces psychedelic effects similar to those of other hallucinogenic tryptamine derivatives, that can last around 2-4 hours. Dangers There have been no reported deaths or hospitalizations from PiPT, but its safety profile is unknown. Legality PiPT is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of PiPT could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to other hallucinogenic tryptamine derivatives.

It toured extensively throughout Australia between 1948–1949 and was threatened with closure by the New South Wales Chief Secretary's Office for obscenity. Production history It was first produced by Doris Fitton and Sydney's Independent Theatre company on 14 October 1948, and advertised as an \\"army comedy documentary\\". The announcement of its ban was made by J. M. Baddeley, Chief Secretary and acting Premier of New South Wales, on 22 October but after initially defying the ban, Doris Fitton avoided a forced closure by commissioning a rewrite from the author. The Independent Theatre took the play, after an unprecedented 20-week run in New South Wales, to reopen The King's Theatre, Melbourne. Meanwhile, another company was playing \\"Rusty Bugles\\" at Killara, New South Wales, so it was the first Australian play to run simultaneously in two states. The words that were the subject of the ban gradually reappeared; no legal action was ever taken, though rewrites were demanded in different states. At the end of its record six-month run in Melbourne, the production transferred to Adelaide, then returned to Sydney at The Tatler. But now critics were writing that it was being played for laughs, with the swearing self-conscious rather than part of the patois. The publisher of the play, Currency Press, quotes Elliott as saying that Rusty Bugles was 'a documentary... Not strictly a play... it has no plot in the accepted sense'. Elliott did not foresee that shortly after this, the genre of the theatre of the absurd would be established as a 'legitimate' dramatic form where plot and the delineation of character are less important than the insight offered into the implicit drama of most human interactions.

Some of the language of the play was toned down for the adaptation. Burke said \\"I'm very excited about the play and I feel sure viewers will react the same way after they see it on tv.\\" It was designed by Kevin Brooks. =Reception= The critic for The Sydney Morning Herald thought the adaptation blundered by not establishing where and when the play was set, saying the director \\"wasted speculation while a huge cast of strange characters passed before him — too many, in fact, to be accommodated comfortably in such short playing lime.\\" He also felt the word \\"flamin' \\" was overused. Another reviewer for the same paper noted the high use of the word \\"flamin\\" (\\"it got a flamin' good workout\\") while \\"the other word, which the wowsers took such exception to when the play was first staged in Sydney some 15 years ago, hardly got a look-in.\\" However he thought \\"Alan Burke's production was a good, smooth job\\" and did \\"draw the pathos from the story.\\" The TV critic for The Age said it \\"came through as a worthwhile piece of Australiana which one should have seen.\\" The Bulletin said \\"most of the flavour\\" of the play came through in the adaptation. The production was repeated in March 1966. 1981 film Sumner Locke Elliot announced in the late 1970s he wanted the play to be filmed. The ABC filmed it in 1981. It was the second last in a series of play adaptations on the ABC. By this stage the play was established as a modern classic - it had been published by Currency Press in 1980 - and the Herald called it \\"a wry, rich and intensely Australian comedy peopled by Australian soldiers who chafe at the boredom of life in an out of the way camp while their mates are off fighting a real war.\\" Alan Burke was again associated with the production as producer, although John Matthews was the director. =Cast= *Graham Corry *Gary Files as Andy Edwards *Ian Gilmour as Rod Carson *Harold Hopkins as Vic Richards *Mark Hembrow *Jeremy Kewley *Serge Lazareff *Stephen Thomas as Eric Otford *Graham Rouse *Tony Barry *Sean Scully *Jack Allen as Mac =Reception= The Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"one of the more enjoyable programs\\" of the week, in which the performances \\"could not be bettered... enjoyed it immensely.\\" The Age called it \\"heady stuff for expatriate Australians and those who have an ear for local slang... the letdowns and character development are predictable, if well done and amusing. What I enjoyed was the throwaway lines.\\" The critic from the Woman's Weekly complained about the \\"quaint, old-fashioned dialogue\\" and \\"some quaint, old- fashioned direction\\" in which \\"the viewer was never certain he was watching a photographed stage play or a badly re-enacted documentary... A study of boredom, became studiously boring.\\" The Canberra Times called the 1981 production \\"the sort of entertainment that makes satire redundant.\\" Another writer for the Age thought the ABC had \\"revived Rusty Bugles without bothering to work out what it was about\\" and complained about the historical accuracy of the uniforms.

There are two symmetry classes of tiles, one containing the blue and green tiles and the other containing the red and yellow tiles. As Heesch proved, this tile cannot tile the plane with only one symmetry class. In geometry, a shape is said to be anisohedral if it admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral (tile- transitive); that is, in any tiling by that shape there are two tiles that are not equivalent under any symmetry of the tiling. A tiling by an anisohedral tile is referred to as an anisohedral tiling. Existence The first part of Hilbert's eighteenth problem asked whether there exists an anisohedral polyhedron in Euclidean 3-space; Grünbaum and Shephard suggestGrünbaum and Shephard, section 9.6 that Hilbert was assuming that no such tile existed in the plane. Reinhardt answered Hilbert's problem in 1928 by finding examples of such polyhedra, and asserted that his proof that no such tiles exist in the plane would appear soon. However, Heesch then gave an example of an anisohedral tile in the plane in 1935. Convex tiles Reinhardt had previously considered the question of anisohedral convex polygons, showing that there were no anisohedral convex hexagons but being unable to show there were no such convex pentagons, while finding the five types of convex pentagon tiling the plane isohedrally. Kershner gave three types of anisohedral convex pentagon in 1968; one of these tiles using only direct isometries without reflections or glide reflections, so answering a question of Heesch. Isohedral numbers The problem of anisohedral tiling has been generalised by saying that the isohedral number of a tile is the lowest number orbits (equivalence classes) of tiles in any tiling of that tile under the action of the symmetry group of that tiling, and that a tile with isohedral number k is k-anisohedral. Berglund asked whether there exist k-anisohedral tiles for all k, giving examples for k ≤ 4 (examples of 2-anisohedral and 3-anisohedral tiles being previously known, while the 4-anisohedral tile given was the first such published tile). Goodman-Strauss considered this in the context of general questions about how complex the behaviour of a given tile or set of tiles can be, noting a 10-anisohedral example of Myers. Grünbaum and Shephard had previously raised a slight variation on the same question.Grünbaum and Shephard, exercise 9.3.2 Socolar showed in 2007 that arbitrarily high isohedral numbers can be achieved in two dimensions if the tile is disconnected, or has coloured edges with constraints on what colours can be adjacent, and in three dimensions with a connected tile without colours, noting that in two dimensions for a connected tile without colours the highest known isohedral number is 10. Joseph Myers has produced a collection of tiles with high isohedral numbers, particularly a polyhexagon with isohedral number 10 (occurring in 20 orbits under translation) and another with isohedral number 9 (occurring in 36 orbits under translation).

In 2009, he proposed a Resource Owners Bill which would transfer resource ownership from the state to customary landowners, and was the subject of heated and lengthy discussion; after being opposed by the Somare government, it was still being debated at least three years later. In July 2009, Kondra was one of 11 National Alliance MPs to defect to the opposition. In November 2009, Kondra was involved in launching the PNG Charter of the International Parliamentarians for West Papua, along with Powes Parkop, advocating self-determination for the people of West Papua. In May 2011, he was one of several MPs to insist that the Ok Tedi mine must close in 2013. Following Peter O'Neill's ouster of Michael Somare as Prime Minister in August 2011, Kondra was named Vice-Minister for Mining in the new government. He subsequently crossed to O'Neill's People's National Congress, and was re-elected for the PNC at the 2012 election. After his 2012 re-election, Kondra was appointed to the O'Neill cabinet as Minister for Tourism, Arts and Culture. In December 2012, O'Neill publicly ruled out any changes to resources ownership laws along the lines of Kondra's long- discussed bill. In September 2013, Kondra was outspoken in support of a successful bid to remove BHP Billiton's legal immunity in regard to the Ok Tedi mine, thanking O'Neill for \\"wiping away the tears of our people\\". He criticised the company for the environmental impact of the mine, in particular due to waste dumping in the Fly River and spoke about deaths caused by pollution. Kondra stated that \\"since 1979, no development had taken place\\" and that his people had \\"been crucified for the benefit of economical benefit\\" by indemnifying the company against lawsuits. In October 2013, he supported a government takeover of the mine to return greater benefit to Western Province, and advocated that Ok Tedi, having been the first mine to be expropriated from corporate ownership, would be \\"a model mine for others to follow\\". In October 2014, he declared that \\"his fight with Ok Tedi was over\\". Misappropriation allegations, trial and dismissal Kondra suffered a heart attack on 27 February 2014 and was transferred to Australia by medivac, but recovered and returned home in mid-March. In July 2014, the Ombudsman Commission referred Kondra to the public prosecutor for alleged misconduct in office, with the public prosecutor recommending the appointment of a leadership tribunal in November. It was alleged that Kondra had misapplied District Services Improvement Program funds on accommodation for himself and on paying campaign debts from the 2012 election. In February 2015, the leadership tribunal suspended him from office pending his trial. He was found guilty on all six charges by the leadership tribunal in April 2015, with the tribunal recommending criminal charges, and in May recommending that he be dismissed from office. Kondra appealed his dismissal to the National Court, and in June won a stay while the appeal was heard. Kondra lost his ministerial portfolios in a January 2016 reshuffle, with O'Neill stating that he would remain as minister without portfolio until his legal issues were resolved. In March 2016, the National Court dismissed Kondra's appeal and confirmed his dismissal from office. Kondra then appealed to the Supreme Court, and again won a stay of his dismissal pending its resolution, in part due to the proximity of the 2017 election. The Supreme Court again dismissed the appeal and confirmed his dismissal in December 2016.

Sexuality in China has undergone revolutionary changes and this \\"sexual revolution\\" still continues today.The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, Demographics and a Historical Perspective Chinese sexual attitudes, behaviors, ideology, and relations have changed dramatically in the past decade of reform and opening up of the country. Many of these changes have found expression in the public forum through a variety of behaviors and ideas. These include, but are not limited to the following cultural shifts: a separation of sex and marriage, such as pre- and extramarital sex; a separation of sex from love and child- bearing such as Internet sex and one-night stands; an increase in observable sexual diversity such as homo- and bisexual behavior and fetishism; an increase in socially acceptable displays and behaviors of female sexual desire; a boom in the sex industry; and a more open discussion of sex topics, including sex studies at colleges, media reports, formal publications, on-line information, extensive public health education, and public displays of affection. As can be seen by these developments, China no longer exerts strict control over personal sexual behavior.Jiang Leiwen. Has China Completed Demographic Transition? , Institute of Population Research, Peking University. Sex is increasingly considered something personal and can now be differentiated from a traditional system that featured legalized marital sex and legal controls over childbirth. The reduction in controls on sexual behavior has initiated a freer atmosphere for sexual expression. More and more people now regard sexual rights as basic human rights, so that everyone has the right and freedom to pursue his or her own sexual bliss.David Barboza. A people's sexual revolution in China. Internal Herald Tribune March 4, 2007 Change in the field of sexuality reveals not only a change of sexual attitudes and behaviors but also a series of related social changes via the process of social transformation. From the sociological perspective, there have been several main factors that have created the current turning point in the contemporary Chinese social context. Contemporary history Since the early 1980s sex and sexuality have become prominent themes of public debate in China, after three decades during which discourses on sexuality were subject to stringent ideological controls. =Market reform and opening-up policy= The denial of the ideals of the Cultural Revolution, during which sex was used as a political tool to control people, is an influential factor in making changes in Chinese society. During the Cultural Revolution, individual sexual preferences were supposed to give way to lofty revolutionary ideals. Extramarital affairs were portrayed as a degenerate lifestyle, and consensual pre-marital sex was immoral. Homosexuality was illegal and would be punished under the statutes for hooliganism. A person had to be sexually well-behaved in order to get a promotion or advance in his or her career.The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors Reforms in the area of sexuality show a lessening amount of government control over individuals' private life. Many sex-related issues and personal lifestyles are no longer relegated to the field of politics and thus exempt from severe legal punishment or moral condemnation. Sex has been returned to the personal sphere under the domain of self-management. These changes can be seen in the weakened interference and control of the government in sex-related areas, strengthened sexual resources in the open market, a diversity of sexual lifestyles, and a strong appeal for sexual rights as human rights. For instance, the government's control of personal lives has gradually retreated since the passing of the new marriage registration principles in October 2003, which again simplified the processes of marriage and divorce. The committed parties no longer need certification or confirmation from their place of work or the local Resident Committee to get married or divorced. The pre-marital physical, which among other things once contained an indication of the woman's virginity, is no longer obligatory. The new principles reflect a greater respect for human rights, a protection of marital freedom, and a change in the governmental function with regards to sexual issues. At the same time, some major social policies have also played an important part. For example, the side effect of the family planning policy is to promote a separation of sexual behavior from reproductive purposes. If a couple can give birth to one child only, sexual behavior is no longer solely practiced to produce babies but also for pleasure. Changes in the legal code have reflected this while also publicly acknowledging sex as a pursuit of happiness. =Stable economic development and consumerism= Under recent policies, the social economy has seen stable and sustainable growth, especially in big cities. Material wealth and an increase in quality of life have brought optimism and consumerism which continually send messages to the individual that it is acceptable to seek sexual happiness. Various sex products are now openly sold in the market. Sexual information is spreading directly or indirectly through such public media as street-side advertising. Fewer people turn away when they see intimate behavior between lovers in public. Condom vending machines are seen on campuses. Products for safe sex are available in convenience stores around city. Even major radio and television stations have started picking up on sex-related topics. Educational programs on sex have become popular. Video shops, big or small, sell sexually oriented films produced either by domestic or foreign directors. More sexual information can also be quickly and easily found on the Internet. Intermingled information, good or bad, has pushed aside many of the traditional sexual taboos and thus shaken the norm of sexual practice. The pursuit of profit may well push sexual minorities such as gays and lesbians to appeal for their rights not just for legal reasons but also to tap into their particular market niches. In a stable, developing economy and consumer culture, an emphasis on individual enjoyment and a respect for differentiation and diversity are now well established and perhaps even flourishing in an atmosphere of confidence and optimism. =Growth of the middle class= One very important factor driving the social change in contemporary China is the great changes in and reorganization of social stratification. One of the most important features is white collar workers — the rise of the new middle class in China. The new middle class tends to stress their personal happiness and pay more attention to their own quality of life. Based on observations, all the visible changes in sexual discourse — including those in gay culture — can be considered a part of middle class culture. Most of the related website owners and participants belong to the white collar workers group. The new lifestyle in sexuality fields such as the DINK — \\"double income, no kids\\"—family, single groups, and cohabitating couples who violate the traditional sex norms are led by middle-class people. They are also the target groups for most gay bars, dating parties, so-called \\"dating on Saturday\\" programs, and sports groups, among others, in Chinese cities. The rise and growth of this middle class has the potential to produce various sexual emancipation discourses, including homosexuality, to break the silence in Chinese society. =Globalization= Since China adopted the policies of opening up and market reform, globalization has meant that there have been many people traveling across countries and from one region to another in China. It means information sharing, product sharing, capital flow, and value sharing, which increasingly includes some basic understanding of sexual rights, gender equality, and human rights. The country's various projects on sexuality, reproductive health, and AIDS prevention each have raised people's awareness of sexuality. Some non- profit international or national organizations are also working in China, while at the same time the international academic community, together with Chinese scholars, is sponsoring workshops and conferences for research on sexuality.Elain Jeffreys (1997) Sex and Sexuality in China. Routledge. Popularization of higher education Popularization of higher education has become one of the major changes in Chinese education.The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, Research and Advanced Education According to recent statistics publicized by the Shanghai Education Commission, the gross entrance rate into higher education in Shanghai is 55 percent, ranking first in the country. Beijing comes a close second, at 53 percent. In the same year, the nation's gross entrance rate into higher education has not yet reached 19 percent. More than half of the population aged 18 to 22 in Shanghai and Beijing can get access to some form of higher education. The impact of higher education has been significant. The younger generation may adopt a different sexual ideology from the older generation because they have more opportunities to get exposure to humanities and social sciences. They are more geared toward the pursuit of equality, freedom, and self-realization. At the same time, society pays more and more attention to elite intellectuals such as professors, researchers, lawyers, and policy-making consultants. Their opinions and ideas are expressed to the public in media reports and at conferences. The spreading of knowledge has been the most influential way to eliminate sex discrimination and sex inequality. Feminist discourse in China Gender equality has been one of China's national policies. The Cultural Revolution slogan \\"Women can hold up half the sky\\" is well known. Many organizations and centers for gender were established after the Fourth UN Conference on Women was held in Beijing in 1995.Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, China - September 1995, Action for Equality, Development and Peace. The government sponsored the conference and then signed the UN documents pledging gender equality, and official women's organizations and feminist activists and scholars have been fighting against gender discrimination and working on achieving gender equality. Their struggle has permeated many aspects of the people's social lives.The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, Basic Sexological Premises Mainstream feminist discourse in China tends to ignore sexuality issues, considering those topics either unimportant or as stirring up unnecessary trouble. Nevertheless, the critical thinking of feminist discourse has challenged stereotyped gender roles, including sexuality roles. The latter especially has influenced many young people. The role of feminist discourse in the field of sexuality has been to redefine a woman's sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that men should be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that men should have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that men should be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men's satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women's sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China's sexual revolution is also women's sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends. While women in previous generations were expected to marry in their twenties, many highly educated women are deciding to hold off on marriage into their 30s or longer. Their increased economic power has given them autonomy so they don't need to rely on a spouse. But the Chinese media has still given them a derogatory name, shengnu (剩女) or \\"leftover women\\". In 2005, China added new provisions to the Law on Women's Right Protection to include sexual harassment. In 2006 \\"The Shanghai Supplement\\" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China. Role of the media and the Internet The media is the catalytic agent of sexual revolution in China. The Internet, too, is one of the most prominent agents wielding important influence among the Chinese people through promoting alliances, sharing knowledge, and providing a platform where various voices can be heard. There are numerous individuals who come to accept their sexual identity mainly because of the Internet. The Internet is a powerful channel for people to find sexual partners, to organize off-line activities, or just simply to have access to sexual knowledge and sex-related information. The Internet has also been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) identity in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the LGBT identity, the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise LGBT identity, let alone embrace and validate the community. Sexual revolution In Chinese language, xingkaifang () is the phrase to describe the sexual opening-up,James Farrer (2002) Opening Up: Youth sex culture and market reform in Shanghai page 24. \\"a globalizing sexual culture prevailing China.\\" Urbanization in China has been accelerating the sexual revolution by providing people with more private space and freedom to enjoy sex, as compared with what was afforded by the traditional countryside way of life. The Internet provides even more powerful support and makes it possible for many people to remain anonymous, to surf the Internet from one website to another, to write their own blogs, and to express what they want in an environment where there is much less prying by co-workers, neighbors, or other peer groups and less judgments put upon their behavior. However, Internet censorship in China does remain an issue. Chinese government has successfully blocked activists from participating political discourse on the internet.MacKinnon Rebecca. \\"Flatter world and thicker walls? Blogs, censorship and civic discourse in China\\". University of Hong Kong, 2007, p.1. Government interventions =The \\"Group Licentiousness\\" law= The PRC Government still regulates sexuality to a greater degree than the governments of Western countries. Recently, Ma Xiaohai, a 53-year-old computer science professor, was sentenced to 3 years in prison for organising wife-swapping events, breaking the \\"group licentiousness law\\" (聚众淫乱罪). =Against the Love Land theme park in Chongqing= The proposed Love Land sex theme park in Chongqing, southwest China, was never opened due to government pressure. The PRC Government suspended its construction in May 2009 and ordered it demolished for being vulgar and explicit. The park was to include displays of giant genitalia and naked bodies, and host an exhibition on the history of human sexuality along with sex technique workshops. The closure is a reflection of the conservatism with regard to sex in China. The theme park was originally due to be opened in October 2009, but was demolished earlier that year, since it was deemed to be a negative influence on Chinese society. AIDS and sexuality The importance of AIDS prevention in China has been stressed by both the global society and the Chinese government.The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, HIV/AIDS Such an increase in concern can be a double-edged sword for the sexual revolution in China. It provides both opportunities and risks. Sexuality has to be openly discussed because of AIDS concerns. For example, in the summer of 2005, China Central Television discussed the topic of AIDS under the title \\"Homosexuality: Confronting is Better than Evading.\\" Scholars and activists have gained the legitimacy to talk publicly about the so-called \\"high risk\\" groups such as gay men and sex workers and have been developing strategies to work together with the government, replacing strategies of attacking the \\"evil\\" with models for caring for those at risk. Sexuality, including homosexuality, has started to enter the public forum. The whole process is still ongoing, but it is breaking the silence on sexuality taboos. AIDS concerns also bring funding, and many organizations are working to fight the illness. The related knowledge and information on sexuality is spreading continuously among Chinese people, and it also strongly helps people to overcome the stereotypes, bias and ignorance regarding AIDS and sexual health issues.

These methods, collectively called multireference coupled cluster formalisms, are versatile and powerful methods for predicting with quantitative accuracy the energetics and cross-sections of a vast range of molecular excitations and ionization. A long-standing problem of guaranteeing proper scaling of energy for many electron wave-functions of arbitrary complexity has also been first resolved by him.

These are now accepted as pioneering and standard works in the field. which has attracted wide international attention. He has also developed a rigorous finite-temperature non-perturbative field theory to study thermodynamics of strongly interacting many body systems, which is now being applied extensively to study dynamics of vibronic coupling at finite temperature. Mukherjee has coauthored more than 200 papers on various aspects of theoretical chemistry and edited Aspects of Many-Body Effects in Molecules and Extended Systems, Lecture Notes in Chemistry, Vol. 50 (Springer Verlag, 1989) and Applied Many-Body Methods in Spectroscopy and Electronic Structure (Plenum Press, 1992). He research interests cover the multi-reference coupled cluster theories, the general methodology in \\"many-body theories\\" and real- and imaginary-time quantum dynamics. Academic background * Bachelor of Science with Honours in Chemistry, Presidency College, Kolkata. As an undergraduate, he won the Ashutosh Mukherjee Award of Presidency College, Calcutta for scoring the highest mark in the introductory examination, a feat usually achieved by a mathematics student. * Masters and Ph.D. in Chemistry from Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta. He began his PhD work under the supervision of Mihir Chowdhury, a fine spectroscopist and an inspirational teacher. He obtained his PhD from Calcutta University. Research highlights =Molecular electronic structure and theoretical spectroscopy= Mukherjee has been the earliest developer of a class of many- body methods for electronic structure which are now standard and highly acclaimed works in the field. These methods, collectively called multireference coupled cluster (MRCC) formalisms, are versatile and powerful methods for predicting with quantitative accuracy the energetics of a vast range of molecular excitations and ionization. The attractive aspects of the formalisms are size-extensivity, compactness and high accuracy. He also developed a linear response theory based on coupled cluster formalism (CCLRT), which is similar in scope to the SAC-CI and done independently of it. It pioneered the use of a dressed hamiltonian for energy differences, which has since been used by others. A long-standing problem of guaranteeing size- extensive theories starting with arbitrary reference functions has also been first resolved by him which has attracted wide international attention. Many comprehensive papers on these topics have elicited much interest. =Quantum many-body dynamics= Mukherjee developed a general time – dependent perturbative theory which remains valid for arbitrarily large time range and is free from secular divergences Later, he generalized this in the many – body regime and formulated the first general time-dependent coupled cluster theory for wave functions of arbitrary complexity. First applications to photo- excitations and energy transfer were highly successful. The method should prove to be useful to study photo-fragmentation and dissociation processes. =Statistical field theory= Mukherjee has developed a rigorous finite – temperature field theory to study Statistical Mechanics of Many-Body systems. Unlike the traditional Thermofield Dynamics formulations, which maps a finite temperature theory to a zero-temperature one, the method has the advantage of working directly with the physical variables in the finite temperature range and is thus both more natural and compact. Applications on partition functions for strongly coupled correlated systems have shown promise of the method. A useful spin-off of the method is the combined use of time-dependent coupled cluster method and boson-mapping of stochastic variables to provide a rigorous and systematic cluster expansion method for monitoring quantum dynamics of systems strongly perturbed by colored noise. =Cumulant based quantum chemistry= Mukherjee has also formulated an electron correlation theory for strongly correlated systems by starting from a combination of reference functions using a generalization of the usual Ursell-Meyer cluster expansion. In order to achieve this, he developed a Wick-like reduction formula using the concept of generalized normal ordering for arbitrary reference functions. An important spin-off from the Generalized Wick's theorem had been the methods of directly determining the various reduced density matrices via generalized Brillouin's theorem and the contracted Schrödinger equations. Mukherjee in collaboration with Werner Kutzelnigg developed such methods starting from his generalized Wick's theorem. =State-specific multireference coupled cluster theory= Recently Mukherjee has developed a suite of state-specific many-body formalisms like coupled cluster and perturbative theories which bypass the difficulty of the notorious intruder problem for computing potential energy surfaces. These methods do not share the shortcomings of the previously used Effective Hamiltonian formalisms applied to cases warranting a multireference description. The current applications of the methods clearly indicate the potentiality of the developments. This is considered a fundamental contribution to the molecular many-body methods, and it has attracted wide international recognition. This theory has been extensively implemented by the group of Henry F. Schaefer, III, who coined the name Mk-MRCC for this method. Currently, this is widely recognized as one of the most promising methods in Quantum Chemistry. =Relativistic coupled cluster theory= Mukherjee has developed one of the most versatile many-body methods which can predict with quantitative accuracy the energetics, hyperfine interactions and transition probabilities of heavy atoms and ions where relativistic effects are important. These are regarded as the state-of-the art contributions in this field. He has also formulated a highly correlated coupled cluster method for understanding optical activity in atoms generated by the Parity Violating Weak – interaction, which is one of the first theoretical formulations of this phenomenon.

Beginning with the One Tonner Ganbare in 1973, Peterson's designs have pioneered many innovations in racing and cruising yachts. In the mid-1970s, Peterson's designs dominated offshore racing events, with a string of winning high-profile IOR boats. Designed for Jack Kelly Yachts, the Peterson 44 debuted in 1976. This boat was a pioneer in performance cruising yacht design and one can still see many of the over 200 built in ports around the world. The design was followed by the Kelly Peterson 46 of which 30 were built, hull number 30, the last one built, is currently circumnavigating the globe. Also the Liberty 458 and the Delta 46 were based on this design.

The store's motto is \\"Good Advice Makes the Difference\\". The chain consists of 295 stores, employs approximately 2,300 people and has an annual revenue of approximately 1.6 billion kr (About US$300 million). Matas also sells personal hygiene products and other home goods. The main types of merchandise sold in stores are make-up products and cosmetics, such as hair colouring, lipsticks and rouge. In addition, most, if not all, Matas shops have a chemical department, where one can find both household chemicals and more rare and exotic chemicals for home chemists, in accordance to the drysalter roots of the store. Other things sold by the retailer include: vitamin supplements, herbal remedies (such as ginseng extracts), and liquorice root.  History  The name Matas is a contraction of Materialisternes Aktieselskab. While the concept of a drysalter/drugstore type shop dates back to the 18th century, the company was founded November 13, 1949, with an investment of 14,000 Danish kroner. (about 1500-1800 USD at the time.) After the first fiscal year, the company ended with a deficit of kr 24.50, or only US$3. That is still the only deficit in the history of the company. In 1951, Matas decided to rebel against the \\"Apotekermonopolet\\" (English: \\"The Drugstore Monopoly\\") which was a law dating back to 1929. This law stated that only pharmacies could sell any form of drugs or vitamin supplements. As a result, Matas began to sell tablets of Vitamin C, but the police took up the case. The case received some media coverage, but ultimately the selling of vitamins was deemed illegal. Matas filed a lawsuit, and after six years it was found that at least 38 of the vitamin supplements being sold in pharmacies and drugstores were dietary supplements, not medicinal drugs. Matas began to manufacture its own line of products under the \\"Matas\\" brand. In 1956, Matas presented its first logo, and in the year after, the company began to work together with the Steins Laboratory. A set of rules regarding the quality of Matas products were also made. In 1958, the first Matas advertising paper was printed. The paper had an initial circulation of 700,000 copies, which at the time was over four times as much as the largest national newspaper. Between 1967 and 1988, there were new products, sub-brands, and a different color theme (blue and white), which is still a major component in the design of the shop interiors and exteriors. In 1967 there were 150 stores in Denmark, and in 1974 just under 200. In 1989 Matas celebrated its 40-year anniversary and received various awards, including \\"MMM-Prisen\\" and \\"Årets Guldkorn\\". In 1994 Matas Miljøfund (English: Matas Environmental Fund) was founded, and in 1997 Matas moved its main administration from Farum to Allerød. In 1999, Matas celebrated its 50-year anniversary with the opening of two new stores in Malmö. In 2001 some Danish laws regarding sales of over-the- counter drugs were changed, and Matas started offering a variety of these types of products. In 2006, Matas' 292 store was opened, before, in May, Matas was sold for 5.2 billion Danish kroner (near US$90,000) to the investment company CVC Capital Partners. Campaigns In 2007 Matas started a campaign in collaboration with Hjerteforeningen (English: The Heart Association)—a private Danish association that undertakes research on cardiovascular disease, heart disease prevention and patient support. Central to the campaign was a commitment to donate one Danish krone to Hjerteforeningen for every item sold from the Matas skincare series, \\"Plaisir\\". The campaign was called \\"Elsk Hjertet\\" (English: \\"Love the heart\\") and was scheduled to run until 2012. Controversies During the years, Matas has been forced to stop selling various chemicals since they were being purchased and used to create improvised explosive devices, especially around New Year's Eve. Among these chemicals are potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate, which are both strong oxidising agents. By 2008 potassium permanganate are again being sold in some Matas shops, albeit under a different brand. In 2011 the company was involved in a conflict with the Danish pharmacy industry, as it campaigned for the right to dispense prescription-only medication. Danish pharmacists responded with a claim that Matas was under pressure from investors who were primarily concerned with profit-generation.

As a child she showed a remarkable talent for singing and at eight years old became a voice student of M. Walter. Not too long after her parents lost all their property, forcing her to abandon her studies. She continued her education as a young teenager with Otto Uschmann and Richard Lewy in Vienna, but was too poor to continue her studies and so joined the chorus of the Vienna State Opera in 1856. In 1859, she made her début at Olmütz as Elvira in Ernani. She then sang for a while in Prague and in 1861, having attracted the attention of Meyerbeer, obtained an engagement at the Berlin State Opera, where her success was absolute for years. In 1863 Lucca made her first appearance in England, which country, as well as France and Russia, she subsequently visited often. Meyerbeer and Auber considered her unequaled, and the latter was so struck by her interpretation of the part of Zerlina in Fra Diavolo that he gave her the pen with which he had written the opera. Lucca had a notorious rivalry with soprano Mathilde Mallinger while in Berlin. The conflict between the two extended among their fans as well, with supporters of Mallinger and supporters of Lucca heckling one another. The tension came to a climax on 27 January 1872 in a performance of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro in which Mallinger sang the Countess and Lucca portrayed Cherubino. During the performance, supporters of Mallinger booed Lucca so severely that she was prevented from singing her aria. So upset by this event, Lucca broke her contract with the opera house and left the German capital to tour the United States for two years where she was received enthusiastically, especially in New York City. She spent the summer of 1872 in Kingston, Rhode Island.Wells, Herbert G. (1937). History of the Tavern Hall Club House (reprint) pp. 1-2 In: Tavern Hall Preservation Society 100th Anniversary.

Typically, when multiple items are available, the desired item is available on the first try or within a handful of tries. This phenomenon dates back to early Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons produced during the Golden Age of American animation. For example, in the 1943 Tex Avery short What's Buzzin' Buzzard, a starving vulture prepares to cook his friend by pulling an entire kitchen's worth of appliances out of thin air. Origins The phenomenon of a character producing plot-dependent items seemingly out of thin air dates back to the beginning of animated shorts during The Golden Age of American animation. Warner Bros. cartoon characters are particularly well known for often pulling all sorts of things—hammers, guns, disguises, matches, bombs, anvils, mallets—from behind their backs or just off-screen. However, this phenomenon was mostly just left to suspension of disbelief. Only decades later was the term hammerspace jokingly coined to describe the phenomenon. The term itself originates from a gag common in some anime and manga. A typical example would be when a male character would anger or otherwise offend a female character, who would proceed to produce, out of thin air, an over-sized wooden rice mallet (okine) and hit him on the head with it in an exaggerated manner. The strike would be purely for comic effect, and would not have any long-lasting effects. The term was largely popularized first by fans of Urusei Yatsura and later by fans of Ranma ½. It is believed by some that the term \\"Hammerspace\\" itself was coined based on the Ranma ½ character Akane Tendo due to the fan perception that she has a tendency to produce large hammers from nowhere. In the original manga she much more frequently uses her fists and/or objects that were pictured in the nearby scenery. The anime makes more use of hammers as a comedic tool than the manga. Another series that may have contributed to the term is City Hunter. One of the lead characters in City Hunter—Kaori—makes extensive use of the \\"transdimensional hammers\\" as they are sometimes called, as they are one of the two main running gags in the series; the other is the extreme lecherousness of the other main character—Ryo—which almost invariably leads to the use of said hammers. The City Hunter hammers also require more explaining in terms of storage, as they are often considerably larger than the characters themselves, and thus more likely to inspire questions like, \\"Where did she get that from!?\\" At the very least, City Hunter predates Ranma ½ by two years, and already had an extensive fanbase. Another series that made extensive use of hammerspace was Kodomo no Omocha, where the mother of the main character would pull toy hammers of varying sizes to tap her daughter on the head to forge breaks in her ranting and offer a chance to glean understanding and wisdom. Trope-laden webcomic Okashina Okashi – Strange Candy also features Hammerspace, this time named directly as such, accessible by the weapons nut Petra. In games The oldest use of hammerspace in games is probably the bag of holding of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, a magical item able to hold far more than normally possible, its contents actually being held in a pocket dimension or part of the Astral Plane. An early computer example of the concept is the 1984 Infocom text adventure The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which contained a \\"Thing your Aunt gave you which you don't know what it is\\" as a humorous variant of the bag of holding concept (and which proved critical to finishing the game itself). The theory of hammerspace can also be applied to many other video games, as game mechanics often defy those of the real world: for instance, a character might be able to carry a sword larger than themselves without any sign of it before use, and most video game characters can carry an implausible number of tools or other objects. This is particularly visible in traditional adventure games and RPGs, such as The Legend of Zelda. Early first-person shooter games tend to have the player character carry an entire arsenal of weapons (with full ammunition) without any visible drawback such as loss of pace or fatigue. In the Grand Theft Auto game series, players are capable of holding an arsenal of weaponry and multiple items and equipment in Hammerspace. This capability has more significant appearance in Grand Theft Auto V, where the characters are able to carry multiple pistols, SMGs, LMGs, assault rifles, carbines, sniper and marksman rifles, melee weaponry, throwables, rocket and grenade launchers, and a minigun all at once on themselves. In Fallout the NPCs and player use hammerspaces where they take weapons out of nowhere. Many humorous adventures make gags on space in item inventories. In Space Quest series III and VI, protagonist Roger Wilco crams a full-sized ladder into his pocket. In Simon the Sorcerer, Simon similarly obtains a ladder at one point, which he stores in his hat. In The Secret of Monkey Island, as a recurring gag, Guybrush Threepwood usually barely fits an oversized item in his clothes, from a six- foot-long cotton swab to a huge figurehead, or even a monkey (which is shown moving underneath his coat). At one point early in The Curse of Monkey Island, he makes a \\"yikes\\" face after sheathing a bread knife down his pants. A similar concept is evident in Sonic the Hedgehog, most notably in the person of Amy Rose, who actually materializes hammers from Hammerspace. Characters from the Kingdom Hearts series are also capable of materializing weapons from thin air and making them disappear again, notably in the case of main character Sora and his Keyblade. In New Super Mario Bros. Wii, the player has endless space to put their items. In many Super Mario games, the Hammer Bros. are capable of throwing an infinite supply of hammers from hammerspace. Although there are numerous examples from the genre, hammerspace usage is not just limited to adventure games. In The Sims 2,The Sims 3 and The Sims 4, the Sims make extensive use of hammerspace, regularly pulling items out of their back pockets which could not possibly fit there. Examples include rakes, hairdryers, watering cans and bags of flour. Similarly, in the sandbox game Minecraft, a player character can carry thousands of tonnes of material such as gold in the character's inventory without encumbrance, as if an empty inventory were the same as a full one. In reality, even one block of most materials in Minecraft would weigh hundreds or thousands of kilograms, and the player can carry up to 2304 blocks in their inventory. Since some blocks can be converted into multiple blocks of another type, it is possible to carry enough material to build an entire city in one's inventory invisibly. Hammerspace is also used frequently in fighting games. In the Super Smash Bros. games, Princess Peach is said to pull a Toad out of hammerspace for a blocking move. In the Punch-Out!! series many characters can pull out objects from hammerspace. Television *A Kit Kat advertising campaign from the late 1980s involved a man and a woman in two separate commercials deciding they wanted something to eat. The woman pulls food items out of her purse, while the man pulls them out of his pocket, and the items they pull out before pulling out a Kit Kat bar were items that, in real life, could not easily be stored there (e.g. the woman pulls a fully intact birthday cake out of her purse, while the man pulls a large hamburger out of his pocket). *The character of Bill Smith from The Red Green Show is often seen pulling large objects and other assorted tools out of his coveralls during the \\"Adventures With Bill\\" segments. *The show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic regularly has the character Pinkie Pie appearing from behind objects much smaller than she, as well as having the ability to pull objects from seemingly out of nowhere, most notably, her party cannon. *On multiple occasions, Phineas and Ferb characters pull things out of nowhere. A few examples: Buford pulls out a velvet rope from hammerspace. Meap pulls out pictures. In some instances, other characters even question where these items came from. * Milo's backpack from the animated series Milo Murphy's Law contains whatever is needed. Objects have included helmets, seat belts, and an anchor. * Cody from Total Drama demonstrates in two episodes to have pants with hammerspace properties. He pulls out a loaf of bread and a soda in \\"Up The Creek\\", and in \\"The Am-AH- Zon Race\\", was able to fit mints, hair gel, body spray, an EpiPen, X-ray glasses, and a flashlight in his pockets. Film *The character of Harpo Marx is often seen retrieving large numbers of items from his seemingly bottomless coat pockets. *The character of Jerry Steiner in the TV show Parker Lewis Can't Lose possessed the same capacity, often using it to feed Larry Kubiac with raw fish he pulls out of his infinite pockets. *In Pirates! Band of Misfits, the Pirate Captain is known to stash various items inside his beard, including an umbrella, an alarm clock and his pet dodo, Polly. *In The Mask film, Jim Carrey's character The Mask produces numerous items from pockets during a fight scene for comic effect. *Mary Poppins's carpetbag easily holds a floor lamp, a hat stand, and other such outlandish items, and their removal from the bag is used for comic effect, and to establish her as a somewhat magical entity. *In Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Ramona Flowers pulls a hammer from hammerspace to fight. *Within the Potterverse, magical examples akin to hammerspace include the Niffler, a creature prominently featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), which can store excessive amounts of loot in its pouch; and Hermione Granger's small hangbag, which contains vast quantities of items that she can retrieve on demand. Notes * The term \\"hammerspace\\" is often used synonymously with \\"magic satchel\\"; however, hammerspace is an actual extra dimension where items are stored, whereas a magic satchel uses magic to either contain these items or to access hammerspace itself. * More often than not, non-animated occurrences in film or television are explained as a plot hole rather than hammerspace access, and dismissed due to suspension of disbelief. Examples include the live-action Highlander TV series, where the sword-wielding Immortals often have their weapons readily available despite their lack of a suitable container or article of clothing in which to carry a concealed sword.

During the nineteenth century Knockan Crag became the subject of much debate when geologists noted that the Moine schists at the top of the crag appeared to be older than the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks such as Durness limestone lower down. Disagreements over the processes that could have caused this to occur were referred to at the time as the 'Highlands Controversy'. The argument was primarily between Roderick Murchison and Archibald Geikie on the one hand and James Nicol and Charles Lapworth on the other. Murchison and Geikie believed the sequence was wrong and that the Moine schists must be the younger rocks. The controversy was finally resolved by the work of Ben Peach and John Horne whose 1907 paper on the subject remains a classic text. Peach and Horne demonstrated that the situation resulted from the action of a thrust fault - this being the first to be discovered anywhere in the world. The older rocks had been moved some 70 kilometres to the west over the top of the younger rocks due to tectonic action.Dryburgh, P. M. et al. (1995) Assynt: The geologists' Mecca.

There is a car park and interpretation centre that explains the geology of the area and gives background to the 'Highlands Controversy', along with three waymarked trails that take visitors to points of interest across the site. The site also hosts artworks such as 'The Globe' by Joe Smith and 'Pipeworm’ by Susheila Jamieson that were commissioned to highlight the inspiration that the landscape has had on artists and poets.The Story of Knockan Crag National Nature Reserve. p. 12. Geological significance The presence of metamorphic gneisses and schists lying apparently stratigraphically above sedimentary rocks of lower Paleozoic age in the Northwest Highlands had been known since the early nineteenth century, convincing Roderick Murchison that the change was a purely metamorphic effect and that the upper gneiss was younger than the sediments beneath. Initially he was supported in this interpretation by Geikie, and James Nicol. After further fieldwork, Nicol changed his mind and advocated instead that the contact at the base of the upper gneisses was tectonic, starting what was known as the \\"Highlands Controversy\\". A tectonic interpretation was supported by, amongst others, Charles Lapworth who had corresponded with Albert Heim on similar structures in the Alps. In 1883 and 1884 the British Geological Survey geologists Ben Peach and John Horne were sent into the area by the survey's director Archibald Geikie to carry out detailed mapping. The results of the mapping proved conclusively to Peach and Horne that the contact was tectonic and they were eventually able to persuade Geikie when he visited them briefly in the field in October 1884. In November that year Peach and Horne's preliminary results were published and Geikie published a paper in the same issue of Nature in which he coined the term \\"thrust-plane\\" for these low-angle faults, although the term was probably already in use before then. By 1888 the term \\"Moine Thrust\\" was being used for the tectonic break at the base of Moine schists (what is now called the Moine Supergroup). The recognition of the Moine Thrust Belt in the early 1880s was a milestone in the history of geology as it was one of the first thrust belts discovered and where the importance of large scale horizontal rather than vertical movements became apparent. Detailed mapping of the Moine Thrust Belt by the survey continued for another two decades, culminating in the classic survey memoir The Geological Structure of the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, published in 1907.Peach, B.N., Horne, J., Gunn, W., Clough, C.T., Hinxman, L.W., and Cadell, H.M. (1888) Report on the recent work of the Geological Survey in the north-west Highlands of Scotland, based on field notes and maps by Messrs. B.N. Peach, J. Horne, W. Gunn, C.T. Clough, L.W. Hinxman, L.W. and H.M. Cadell. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, 44, 378-441. A monument to Peach and Horne's work was erected by the international geological community at Inchnadamph, a few miles to the north. Flora and fauna Cotton grass at Knockan Crag The plantlife of the area is highly influenced by its underlying geology. The soils formed on areas of limestone, fucoid beds and salterella grits are much richer than those on Moine schists. The lime-rich areas consequently support a richer vegetation, including plants such as mountain avens and rock sedge, whilst areas underlain by Moine schists tend to consist of wet heath and blanket bog. The transition between the two vegetation patterns is especially marked on the plateau above the crags, where there are small limestone knolls separated by peat-filled areas.The Story of Knockan Crag National Nature Reserve. p.p. 8-9. Bird species found at Knockan Crag include kestrel, raven and ring ouzel, along with song birds such as dunnock, wren, stonechat and meadow pipit. Red- and black-throated divers visit nearby Lochan an Ais during the winter and spring, and so can be observed from the crag. Red deer regularly cross through the site. Conservation designations The Globe Knockan Crag became part of the Inverpolly national nature reserve (NNR) on 28 September 1962. In 2004, following a review of all NNRs in Scotland, it was decided to remove NNR status from the wider Inverpolly area, however it was to be retained for Knockan Crag.The Story of Knockan Crag National Nature Reserve. p. 11. The crag was declared a NNR in its own right on 24 February 2004.

He was appointed as Head Mudaliyar and the aide-de-camp to the British Governor of Ceylon, therefore he was one of the most powerful personalities in British colonial Ceylon. Early life Solomon Dias Bandaranaike was born on 22 May 1862, the son of the Anglican Gate Mudaliyar Don Christoffel Henricus Dias Abeywickrema Jayatilake Seneviratne Bandaranaike, Mudaliyar of the Governor's Gate and Mudaliyar of Siyane Korale East and Anna Florentina Philipsz. His grandfathers were Don Solomon Dias Bandaranayake, Mudaliyar of Siyane Korale East and Phillipsz Gysbertus Panditaratne, Mohandiram of the Governor’s Gate. He was educated at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia in Colombo. His sister Charlotte married Gate Mudaliyar Solomon Seneviratne, Mudaliar of the Atapattu of the Western Province. Colonial service He was appointed a Muhandiram of the Governor's Gate in 1882 by Prince Albert, Duke of Clarence during his royal visit to Ceylon, following the death of his father in 1887 he succeeded him to the post of Mudaliyar of the Siyane Korale East. Eight years later, Governor Sir Arthur Havelock appointed him to the post of Maha Mudali (Head Mudaliyar) following the death of then Head Mudaliyar Conrad \\"Peter\\" Petrus Dias Wijewardena Bandaranaike who was also his uncle. This was the highest position available to a native Ceylonese in British Ceylon in 1895 and traveled to England as Ceylon's official representative at the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1896. He was the youngest to hold the position at the age of thirty three and would hold it for thirty three years until his retirement in 1928. Wealth Sir Solomon was a wealthy land owner with large estates. Apart from his town house in Colombo, he built a stately house, Horagolla Walauwa, and converted his fathers walauwa in Horagolla to his stables, Horagolla Stables. He was the first Ceylonese to own a house in the hill station of Nuwara Eliya, which was an exclusive holiday destination for the British. Honours Bandaranaike having received the honor appointment to the office of Head Mudaliyar, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace by the Governor and received permission from the Governor to add Rajakumaruna (meaning Royal Prince) to his name. For his service to the British Empire was marked by his appointment as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1902 and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), after travelling to England as Ceylon's official representative at the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Attending the Coronation of King Edward VII, he received the King Edward VII Coronation Medal. He was a Fellow of the Colonial Society and the Imperial Institute. A keen horse breeder, he was the Life President of the Colombo Turf Club, which erected a statue during his life time in front of the Turf Club in Colombo which stands to this day. He was collector of antiquities, he donated Sir Henry Blake’s collection of palm leaf manuscripts to the Colombo National Museum. He was a life-member of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon Family In April 1898, he married Daisy Ezline Obeyesekere, daughter of Solomon Christoffel Obeyesekere, a member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon. His son, Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike, became the 4th Prime Minister of Ceylon after independence, and his granddaughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, became both Prime Minister and President of Sri Lanka.

She appeared in 120 films between 1925 and 1956. Early life Boniface was born in New York City, the daughter of George C. Boniface, an actor, and his wife Norma Ferner Boniface, an inventor. Symona's father was of English extraction and her mother of German heritage, though both were New York natives.United States Census: Year: 1910; Census Place: Manhattan Ward 12, New York, New York; Roll: T624_1026; Page: 7B; Enumeration District: 0694; Image: 874; FHL Number: 1375039. Career Boniface is probably best known as a society matron foil for slapstick comedy trio the Three Stooges, in which she intercepted many a flying pie. Thanks to the daily television broadcast of the wildly popular Stooge films, Boniface is widely seen on a regular basis. Boniface employed her perfect comic timing in several of her appearances. She dealt with a shrinking or torn skirt in No Census, No Feeling and Crash Goes the Hash, squirmed uncontrollably thanks to a mouse crawling down her back in Loco Boy Makes Good, and was flooded in both Spook Louder and her final appearance, Vagabond Loafers. Conversely, she maintained her composure in Micro-Phonies and even dealt Curly Howard several painful face slaps in An Ache in Every Stake. =Half-Wits' Holiday= Boniface's tour de force performance came in Half-Wits Holiday opposite Moe Howard. Mischievous Larry grabs a cream pie from a pastry table, and tries to eat it whole. Moe sees this, swipes the pie, and pushes Larry out of the way. Seeing the approaching Mrs. Smythe-Smythe (Boniface), Moe tosses the pie straight up, resulting in it sticking to the ceiling. Noticing his nervousness and frequent upward glances, Smythe-Smythe sympathetically comments, \\"Young man, you act as if the Sword of Damocles is hanging over your head.\\" Moe tells her she must be psychic and leaves. Bewildered, Mrs. Smythe-Smythe says \\"I wonder what's wrong with that young man?\\" and looks up to see what had him so concerned. At that moment, the pie comes crashing down in the society matron's face. The footage would be recycled four more times over the next 13 years in the films Pest Man Wins, Scheming Schemers, Pies and Guys and Stop! Look! and Laugh!. Boniface also appeared in the Stooges' 1949 television pilot Jerks of All Trades, which would be the last project she ever appeared in. Stock footage of her would appear in six ensuing Stooges shorts following her death. Personal life and death Boniface married Frank Pharr Simms, a salesman and real-estate broker from Decatur, Georgia.United States Census: Year: 1930; Census Place: Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California; Roll: 137; Page: 16A; Image: 601.0; Family History Library Film: 2339872.United States, Selective Service System.

He has an older half-brother, Chris (born in 1957), and a younger brother, Mark (born in 1970). Nicky is the first cousin of Phil Leonetti, an admitted former underboss of the Philadelphia crime family. The Scarfo family moved from Philadelphia to Atlantic City, New Jersey before Nicky Jr.'s birth. Nicky Scarfo Jr. grew up on North Georgia Avenue in the Ducktown section of Atlantic City. His grandmother, Catherine Scarfo, owned the building and lived there. Nancy and Phil Leonetti also lived in the building.Anastasia, George. \\"Mob Trial Hears Scarfo Jr., On Tape, Psyching For A Hit.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. November 4, 1994. Despite his father's position within the Philadelphia mob, the Scarfos were not wealthy while Nicky was growing up. In 1980, Scarfo Sr. was named the Philadelphia outfit's consigliere, and in 1981 he was named boss. Only then did the Scarfos begin to live a more lavish lifestyle. Nicky graduated from Holy Spirit High School in Absecon, New Jersey, in 1983. By one account, Nicky Scarfo Jr. was not involved in crime during his teens and did not intend to become involved in the syndicate. As one classmate noted, \\"When I knew him, he was a good guy. He was just a regular guy who tried to do the right thing and everyone knew who his father was, but we never talked about that.\\"Quoted in Anastasia, George. \\"'Nicky Jr.': Where Does the Boss' Son Fit In?\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. March 10, 1991. Early years in the Scarfo crime family After graduation, Nicky Scarfo allegedly became involved in organized crime.

July 12-18, 2002. Accessed April 12, 2008. However, the relationship with Joey Merlino was to prove inauspicious. Their friendship, which was very close, ruptured in 1988 when Chuckie Merlino was convicted of racketeering and sentenced to 45 years in a federal penitentiary. Merlino was then demoted by the elder Scarfo,Caparella, Kitty. \\"Recalling A Bloody Hit.\\" Philadelphia Daily News.

Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale later testified in court that Merlino \\"hated\\" Scarfo from this time onward.Anastasia, George. \\"Mob Boss Natale Tells of 'Descent Into Hell'.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. March 31, 2001. In the late 1980s, Nicky Scarfo Sr. came under increasing legal pressure as the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a massive investigation of the Scarfo crime family's operations. Twenty members of Scarfo's organization were imprisoned, and many more came under indictment. Five members of the Philadelphia crime family turned state's evidence against the elder Scarfo, including soldiers Nicholas Caramandi and Eugene Milano, capos Thomas DelGiorno and Lawrence Merlino (Chuckie Merlino's brother), and underboss (and Scarfo relative) Phil Leonetti.Anastasia, George. The Last Gangster. Paperback ed. New York: Avon Books, 2005. During the trial, Mark Scarfo attempted suicide on November 1, 1988. Mark, then only 17 years old, had been taunted for years by classmates about his father's criminal activities. Increasingly despondent over his father's possible imprisonment, Mark Scarfo hanged himself in the office of his father's concrete supply company in Atlantic City. He was discovered by his mother, and paramedics were able to resuscitate him. He suffered cardiac arrest and his brain was deprived of oxygen. He entered a coma where he remained until his death in April 2014.Sheehan, Kathy. \\"Scarfo's Son 'Put Through Hell'.\\" Philadelphia Daily News.

On November 4, 1988, just three days after Mark's suicide attempt, Nicky Scarfo Jr. and a friend assaulted a woman in an elevator at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. The woman said the two men had looked menacingly at her, and she pretended to reach for a gun in her coat. The two men then punched her, pushed her to the floor, and kicked her several times. Scarfo was arrested for assault, convicted, fined, and put on probation for the incident.Caba, Susan. \\"Scarfo Jr. Gets Probation and Fine for Conviction in Hospital Beating.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer.

Nicky Scarfo Jr. may have attempted to use his father's conviction as a means of rising within the syndicate. In October 1989, Scarfo Jr. bodyguard George Fresolone turned state's evidence and began wearing a wire.Barry, Jim. \\"Trouble With a Capital N.\\" Philadelphia City Paper. April 19–26, 2001.

Fresolone taped Scarfo Jr. plotting the death of his cousin, Phil Leonetti, an act which would have allowed him to rise within the Philadelphia criminal organization: > My father says, he says, this one is definitely my responsibility. He can't > rest. ... I told him, I says, \\"I ain't resting till it's f-ing done\\"... How > can I rest? How could I sleep at night? ... It's always eating at me, eating > at me. The evidence was later used to help indict Scarfo Jr. on racketeering and conspiracy charges in 1990. =Halloween assassination attempt= His father's conviction severely undermined Nicky Scarfo Jr.'s position in the Philadelphia crime family, as many family members were angry at the elder Scarfo's alleged mismanagement of organized crime enterprises and his arrogance. On the evening of October 31, 1989, Nicky Scarfo Jr. was dining at an Italian restaurant in Philadelphia when a man wearing a Batman mask and holding a plastic Halloween candy bag entered the restaurant and approached Scarfo's table. The man pulled a MAC-10 machine pistol from the bag and fired at Scarfo. Scarfo was struck eight times in the neck, arms and torso, but no vital organs were hit.Anastasia, George. \\"Scafidi Details Mob Hits, Attempts.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. April 25, 2001.

November 1, 1989; \\"Scarfo Assault Theories.\\" San Jose Mercury News. November 2, 1989.

This was confirmed by testimony from former Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale, who also turned state's evidence and said that Merlino told him about committing the crime while they served time together in 1990. At least one other mobster testifying on behalf of the government alleged that soldier Pete \\"Pete the Crumb\\" Caprio also knew of the hit and attempted to prevent it. Authorities also suspected Charles \\"Chaz\\" Iannece of the attempted murder because he delivered a controversial kiss on the cheek to Scarfo shortly before the gunman attacked.\\"Chaz\\" Iannece is the son of jailed mob soldato Charles \\"Charlie White\\" Iannece. The younger Iannece is allegedly a hitman and extortionist, and deeply involved in the distribution of methamphetamine for the Scarfo crime family in the 1980s. See: DiFilippo, Dana. \\"Giant Meth Ring Busted.\\" Philadelphia Daily News. September 20, 2008. Nicky Scarfo Jr. became an unimportant player in the Philadelphia mob after the hit. He adopted a very low profile to avoid drawing attention to himself, most likely (police assumed) because he had few allies who would protect him. Scarfo moved to Newark, New Jersey, shortly afterward.Smith, Jim. \\"Scarfo Jr. Jailed for Bookmaking.\\" Philadelphia Daily News. June 29, 2002.

Law enforcement officials alleged that Scarfo Sr. arranged to have his son inducted into the Lucchese crime family New Jersey faction to protect him from further attempts on his life.At least one source says that Scarfo Jr. was inducted into the Gambino crime family, not the Lucchese. See: Smith, Jim. \\"Scarfo Jr. Jailed for Bookmaking.\\" Philadelphia Daily News. June 29, 2002. According to a 2007 court affidavit filed by the New Jersey State Organized Crime Control Bureau, Scarfo Jr. was later \\"made\\" and elevated to the position of soldier within the Lucchese crime family—effectively protecting him from any additional murder attempts. After the assassination attempt As a member of the Lucchese crime family, Nicky Scarfo Jr. became involved in a number of criminal enterprises. In 1990, Nicky Scarfo and Gaetano \\"Tommy Horsehead\\" Scafidi were allegedly ordered to beat mobster Martin Angelina because he refused to stop associating with Chuckie Merlino. According to court testimony by Scafidi (who had turned state's evidence by this time), they beat Angelina with aluminum bats to make sure the bats wouldn't break. In August 1990, Scarfo was arrested on federal charges of racketeering and conspiracy to manufacture and distribute illegal video poker machines.LeDuc, Daniel and Anastasia, George. \\"Mobster-Information Leads to Arrests of Nicodemo Scarfo Jr., 28 Others.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer.

September 9, 1993. During his imprisonment, Scarfo was placed in \\"protective isolation\\" by prison authorities. Government officials claimed to have received information indicating that Scarfo's life was in danger in prison. Thus, they isolated him from the rest of the prison population, permitting him limited exercise and other time out of his cell. Scarfo and his attorneys claimed that no such information existed, and that the involuntary isolation was punishment for Scarfo's other alleged (but unproven) criminal activity.

Scarfo Jr. had been released from prison in 1997, and largely sat out the Philadelphia mob war. But once Natale was in prison and Merlino was in control of the syndicate, it is alleged that Merlino focused his attention back on Scarfo. One mobster who turned state's evidence testified that in 1999 or 2000, Merlino allegedly sent capo Peter \\"Pete the Crumb\\" Caprio and associate Daniel D'Ambrosia to watch Scarfo and gather evidence about his movements so that a hit might be planned. Court testimony later asserted that Caprio also stopped a Merlino-ordered hit on Scarfo Jr while the elder Scarfo served time in a federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia. In June 2002, Nicky Scarfo Jr. went to jail again. He had been arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for helping to run a multimillion-dollar illegal gambling and loan sharking operation.Porter, David. \\"NY, NJ Crack Down on Alleged Mob Gambling Rings.\\" Associated Press.

An Organized Crime Control Bureau affidavit made in 2007 alleges that Scarfo met Merola after moving to New Jersey in the early 1990s. Scarfo later became godfather to Merola's son. The affidavit claims that Scarfo helped manage Merola's illegal gambling operations in 1998 and 1999 after Merola was briefly jailed after being convicted of extortion. Although Scarfo was a \\"person of interest\\" in the case, he was never charged; Merola pleaded guilty and was convicted of several felonies in connection with the case in early 2010. In December 2007, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Scarfo Jr. had been demoted within the Lucchese crime family in part because of ongoing media coverage of his activities and in part because he intended to start a mob war to regain control of the Philadelphia outfit.Anastasia, George. \\"Probe's Detailed View of Mob Life.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer.

Law enforcement officials also found two handguns at Scarfo's home; as a convicted felon, Scarfo could be charged with felony unlawful possession of a firearm. Based on the seized documents, federal prosecutors alleged that Scarfo and Pelullo took control of FirstPlus Financial Group in June 2007 and \\"transferred several million dollars between June 2007 and May 2008 to corporate entities controlled by Pelullo and Scarfo Jr.\\" A later estimate put the amount of stolen money at $4.86 million.Anastasia, George. \\"Nearly $5 Million Mob-Linked Fraud Cited.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer.

It is an activity of the Uniting Church in Australia, Queensland Synod. The college shares its grounds with Trinity College Queensland and the Queensland Synod office. It was designed by architect Claude William Chambers and built c.1904 to c.1905. It is also known as Raymont Lodge and Drysllwyn. Drysllwyn was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This large, two-storey brick residence was built c.1904 to c.1905 for mining entrepreneur William Davies. Davies, who was involved in the gold industry in Gympie, moved to Brisbane around the turn of the century and purchased the Auchenflower site in 1903. Architect Claude Chambers, whose Brisbane work spanned fifty years (1885-1935), won a competition to design the residence known as Drysllwyn. The building was large and spacious with richly decorated main interior spaces. The ground floor contained dining, breakfast and drawing rooms, library, kitchen, bathroom, laundry and storerooms. On the first floor were located a main bedroom with dressing room and bathroom, two other bedrooms, another bathroom, a visitor's room and servant's bedroom. Verandas on two levels enclosed the building on three sides. The grounds contained a formal garden. During the 1930s part of the property was subdivided for residential development. The Davies family resided at Drysllwyn until February 1942, when it was leased to the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association for use by Somerville House as a day school. Somerville House had been forced to vacate temporarily their property at South Brisbane for use as administrative headquarters for the United States Army. In 1944-1945 the property was acquired by the Methodist Church (one of the foundational denominations of the Uniting Church in Australia), and converted into a hostel for country girls studying in Brisbane. The hostel was opened in August 1945 and the building renamed Raymont Lodge, in honour of Mrs E Raymont who had made a substantial bequest to the Methodist Church. The hostel was run under the auspices of the Central Methodist Mission. A parsonage for the Superintendent of the Central Methodist Mission was erected in the western corner of the property facing Cadell Street. By the 1960s a new dormitory wing had been added to house both male and female students. During the 1980s major changes occurred on the site with the Uniting Church relocating its state headquarters and Trinity Theological College (now known as Trinity College Queensland) sharing the grounds. A three-storey brick office building was erected at the rear of Drysllwyn and facing Bayliss Street. A new residential building was built to promote accommodation for tertiary students. Conservation work was undertaken on Drysllwyn during this period. Present use Raymont Residential College currently hosts accommodation for up to 120 tertiary students. Due to its central location and access to public transport, many of these students attend the University of Queensland, Queensland University of Technology, the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, Queensland College of Art and Southbank TAFE. Richard Niessl is the current principal of the college.  Description  Raymont Lodge, 1944 The college campus consists of two accommodation blocks and other facilities located in houses onsite, with the offices in the historic mansion Drysllwyn. This building, situated on the crest of a rise overlooking Auchenflower, is a large, two-story red brick residence built in the Federation style. The building has a half-gabled roof of broad profile, rolled edge iron sheeting with a projecting hipped bay to the northeast and southeast, a pedimented entry porch to the northwest and elaborately detailed chimneys. The building has deep verandas with arched masonry arcades and timber balustrade to the north, east and west. The entry porch is approached via a wide flight of steps and has paired columns to the first floor supporting the pediment. French doors with fanlights and step-out sash windows open onto the verandas. The timber-panelled main entry door is set in a large arched brick opening with stained glass fanlight and sidelights. A bathroom opening off the southeast veranda has a similarly elaborate doorway. The interior features decorative stained glass, ornate plaster mouldings and finely detailed cedar staircases, joinery, panelling and fireplace surrounds. The building is approached via a paved drive and turning circle from the northwest, with most of the recently constructed buildings being located to the north, east and south of the building leaving the Cadell Street aspect intact. The grounds contain a number of mature trees, with an in-ground swimming pool to the northwest. Although much of the site has been subdivided and sold for suburban housing, remnants of the original landscaping survive, as does a section of masonry perimeter fence, with iron entrance gates, which extends to the corner of Cadell Street and Park Avenue, returning along the latter.

It is Thailand's center for export-oriented industries. High value goods, such as Japanese branded automobiles, which are manufactured there and shipped elsewhere, are among the many exports. The region includes Chonburi Province, Chachoengsao Province, and Rayong Province with Samut Prakan Province on the periphery.  Development  EEC development will cost 1.5 trillion baht in its first five years. The EEC is a key component of the \\"Thailand 4.0\\" economic policy announced in 2016. The prime minister has invoked the special powers of Section 44 of the interim charter three times already to remove obstacles to EEC development. Planners see the region as strategically important as it borders the gulf as well as being close to Bangkok, and its major airport. Laem Chabang port, Thailand's largest and 23rd busiest container port in the world as of 2014, is the region's port. Bangkok, Suvarnabhumi Airport, and the port are all linked by the Bang Na Expressway. Two large infrastructure projects worth a total of 36 billion baht, both railways, were approved on 23 October 2007, to link Korat and Lat Krabang District in Bangkok with Laem Chabang port. Thai logistics firm Best Group and the Shenzhen (China) property company Hydoo International have raised US$3 billion to construct a giant financial technology, trade, and logistics centre on a site near Suvarnabhumi Airport. When complete, the centrepiece of the 2.5 square kilometre Trust City World Exhibition and Trade Centre will be a 100,000 m2 exhibition hall. It would be the largest exhibition centre in the world. In addition to an exhibition venue, the project will also accommodate more than 20,000 wholesale shops, 5,000 business-class hotel rooms for traders and tourists, 6,000 less expensive rooms for employees, as well as serviced apartments, and 30,000 parking spaces. The project is expected to be completed by 2020. Environmental impacts Serious problems resulting from pollution have plagued the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate in Rayong, an industrial zone for petrochemical and heavy industries that has suffered from heavy metal and organophosphates poisoning. Factory workers in the region are among the highest paid in Thailand, often more than physicians in the region, but occasionally suffer physical ailments. A lawsuit filed by local villagers in 2007 led to a cascade of decisions that in 2009 stopped work on many projects under construction for not being in compliance with environmental provisions in the country's new constitution.

Harry White & B. Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), vol. 2, p. 765-6. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1735. In 1757 he was a co-founder member, with the Earl of Mornington, of the Musical Academy in Dublin. His first publicly performed piece was the burletta Midas, stylistically a bridge between ballad opera and comic opera. The work mixes Irish, English, French and Italian popular airs in O'Hara's arrangements with spoken recitatives. \\"O'Hara's verse rarely rises above clever doggerel.\\"O'Connell (2013), p. 765. In 1774, Kane established a theatre in Dublin called Mr. Punch's Patagonian Theatre, which in 1776 transferred to London, producing puppet show versions of operas and burlettas. He went blind in 1781 but continued his interest in theatre until his death in Dublin the following year. A number of his papers and manuscripts are held at the National Library of Ireland.

Plot Alberto Nardi (Alberto Sordi) is a Roman businessman who fancies himself a man of great capabilities, but whose factory (producing lifts and elevators) teeters perennially on the brink of catastrophe. Alberto is married to a rich and successful businesswoman from Milan, Elvira Almiraghi (Franca Valeri) who has a no-nonsense attitude and barely tolerates the attempts of her husband to keep his factory afloat with her money. Alberto tries to \\"keep up\\" with his wife and her rich and successful friends but he only manages to ridicule himself. Amused by his antics Elvira publicly treats her husband as a silly clown, confident that he'll never leave her in the hope of profiting from her fortune. One day a train on which Elvira was supposed to be traveling (to pay visit to her old mother) suffers a horrible accident falling off a bridge and no survivors are reported. Alberto is overjoyed and in a veritable ecstatic rush plans to liquidate most of Elvira's assets, brings his mistress in her country villa and starts dreaming of a bright future only to be frustrated when Elvira appears alive and well: a last-minute phone call from his own accountant and handyman (Marquis Stucchi) prevented her from boarding the doomed train. Frustration and anger throw Alberto in a nervous breakdown from which he emerges with a diabolic plan: to sabotage the elevator in the city attic he shares with Elvira to have her killed and inherit her fortune for good. The German engineer working in his factory agrees with Nardi's plan and with the help of unlikely accomplices like Marquis Stucchi and his own uncle (who acts as Alberto's chauffeur) the murderous project is set in motion, with an unintended and tragicomical result. The movie is a splendid example of the commedia all'italiana which Risi directs on an unusually black register where Sordi depicts an outrageously sleazy character (arrogant to his subjects, megalomaniac, a bigoted unrepentant fascist who yet longs for recognition from the businessmen who envies). It is also a period piece, showing the contradictions and miseries lying behind Italy's postwar economic miracle.

In order for it to be screened publicly, the Committee recommended the removal of the following scenes: 1) Father Agostino, who took part in the funeral as a priest, is shown sipping a glass of wine; 2) Elvira’s line “She is a fool, an Anita Garibaldi type of fool… but instead of a hero she found my husband.” The reason for the restriction, cited in the official documents, is because the aforementioned scene was considered immoral and the line was considered to be opposed to national reputation and decency. The official document number is: N° 3036, it was signed on 17 Nov 1959 by Minister Domenico Magrì Remake A remake entitled Wannabe Widowed, starring Luciana Littizzetto and Fabio De Luigi, was released in 2013.

It is renowned for its expansive fishing industry. Geography and administration Although within the historic county boundaries of Hampshire, at the time of the 1974 local government re-organization it was considered desirable that the whole of what is now called the South East Dorset conurbation, which includes Bournemouth and Poole, should be part of the same county. Throop is currently part of the Throop and Muscliffe Ward within the Bournemouth borough councilBournemouth.gov.uk – Bournemouth Council Online and is close to the River Stour featuring countryside views over the Stour Valley. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 8,882. Also in the area is Muccleshell. History Throop village has existed for many years and is described in various historical texts relating to the Bournemouth area – in 1842 it is referred to as a \\"Pleasant and secluded village\\".The visitor's guide to Bournemouth and its neighbourhood By Thomas Johnstone Aitkin Throop Mill One of the main characteristics of modern-day Throop is the watermill referred to as “Throop Mill”. The watermill in Throop village has been present in some regard from the 12th century passing through various ownership's including monks from Quarr Abbey and was mentioned in the Domesday Book because of the tales that surround it. It has often been suggested that the old building and the surrounding area has been haunted by pacing black figures and sometimes the sound of voices, the voices are said to be those of some children who went missing in the area in the 1800s. Their laughter and cries are said to fill the cold night air with loneliness. There are mysteries and many a dark folk tale that surround the mill and the local area and not surprisingly despite many attempts to re-open, the mill remains closed to the public. It has been suggested by the local council to turn the site into tea rooms. The mill has three floors, most of which are in surprisingly good condition for their age, though is full to the brim with spiders. There is shattered glass due to people throwing rocks. The interior is peppered with laminated sheets , which suggests this was going to be an educational exhibit of some kind, and now some types of cautionary measures, such as yellow tape. The mill is in a lovely location in the small village of Throop. A popular location for tourists and dog walkers with the river stour located a just a short walk away it is a perfect place to get in some fishing or have a picnic. The Stour Valley Way Throop House Throop House is the finest house in the village, and with its unrivalled river frontage and of gardens, is one of the most delightful and distinctive homes in Bournemouth. The house was built in 1804 of the distinctively cream Bournemouth brick. It was built by Lord Malmesbury as the dower house for Hurn Court a mile away across the River Stour. Several magnificent cedar trees are the highlight of the gardens. In 1959 Dr James Fisher (after whom the James Fisher Medical Centre in Shillingstone Drive is named) and his wife Rosemary and family came to Throop House where they lived until 1978. In 1975 their eldest son Adrian, the internationally renowned maze designer, created his first maze in the garden of Throop House; this maze planted in holly unfortunately no longer exists. Throop Ford and the Pig Shoot There has been a ford across the River Stour for many centuries, some 400 metres downstream of Throop Mill. Tradition holds that it was the place where Sir Walter Tyrrell crossed the River Stour in August 1100 on his way to Poole and exile, having killed King William Rufus in the New Forest a few hours earlier. Over the centuries, a substantial structure of posts was created, holding back a broad strip of gravel some 50 metres long. In Victorian times, crossing the ford was a popular highlight for horse-and- carriage trips by visitors to Bournemouth. In the Second World War, to deny advantage to a possible German invasion, the retaining posts were removed, and the ford was washed away. At this point, the river is now deep and makes a sharp turn, and all that remains of the ford is the sloping track down to the river known as the Pig Shoot, and the gravel track to which it is aligned on the opposite bank. The track on the opposite bank leads on to a second ford, still intact, across the Leaden Stour. This is known locally as Pansy's Bathing Place, named after the golden retriever of Dr and Mrs James Fisher, who have lived in Throop (in Throop House and latterly in Throop Mill Cottage) since 1959. Pansy loved swimming in this ford.

It is near the village of Carrington, Greater Manchester, England, and replaced The Cliff as the club's training ground in 2000. Construction on the complex began in 1999, the main building was opened and the first team moved in in 2000, followed in 2002 by the Academy facility, home to the club's renowned youth system. In 2013, major additions were completed at the complex, including a medical centre and sports science department, bringing the total construction cost of the training complex to over £60 million. Development At the end of the 1990s, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson felt that the club's training ground, The Cliff (which had been in use since 1938), was inadequate as the Premier League entered the 21st century. Ferguson was also unhappy about the lack of privacy at The Cliff, with journalists present on a daily basis, opposition team scouts able to watch training sessions, and supporters asking for autographs and photographs with players. The club's board set about finding a new location for their training ground, and purchased more than 100 acres of secluded land in Carrington – less than from Old Trafford stadium – with a vision to transform it into a world-class sports training facility. Construction began in 1999, with a budget of £22 million, of which £14 million was spent on the Main Building (first team) which opened in the summer of 2000, and a further £8 million spent on the Academy Facility, opening in the summer of 2002. A new £25 million medical and sports science facility was constructed on the grounds in 2013. This brought the total cost of construction to over £60 million. Approximately 300 people work at Carrington on a daily basis. Facilities =Main Building= The Main Building, which houses the Manchester United first team, was opened in the pre-season of 2000. It comprises two levels. The ground floor includes; a large gymnasium, indoor running tracks, rehabilitation training hall, squash and basketball courts, weights room, 25-metre swimming pool, remedial and hydrotherapy pools, spa pool, jacuzzi, underwater treadmills, sauna and steam rooms, sunbeds (for Vitamin D), yoga rooms, administration and executive offices, seven team changing rooms, staff changing rooms, laundry rooms and five kit/boot rooms. The first floor includes; the first team manager's office (overlooking outdoor training pitches), manager's personal assistant office, assistant manager's office, coaches offices, match and opposition analysis suite, physiotherapy treatment rooms (with 10 physio beds), massage rooms, first aid station, doctor's office, physio's office (overlooking swimming pools, rehab hall, and weight room), classrooms, conference rooms, charity staff offices (Manchester United Foundation), restaurant seating over 100 people, player's lounge, recreation and games rooms, as well as an elevated, covered viewing gallery overlooking the outdoor pitches. The Main Building was extended and updated in 2013. =The Academy= The Academy Facility, which houses the Manchester United Football Club Under-21s, was opened in the close-season of 2002 by club legend Sir Bobby Charlton, himself a product of the club's prestigious Academy. The Academy Facility comprises two levels. The ground floor includes; a full-size indoor football pitch with a synthetic AstroTurf surface, a full- size outdoor football pitch with heated and floodlit AstroTurf surface (built to specifications of the pitch at Old Trafford), 11 dressing rooms for; youth teams, coaches and referees, coaches briefing rooms, kit/boot room, player treatment facility and physio's office. The first floor includes; indoor viewing balcony overlooking indoor pitch, outdoor viewing balcony overlooking outdoor pitches, visitors and parents lounge, staff training rooms and an MUTV television studio. Manchester United Soccer Schools also use the Academy Facility, and young students can avail of education facilities at the ground. =Medical & Sports Science Department= In 2012, work began on a new £25 million medical facility at the site. It was completed in early 2013, and includes a state-of-the-art hospital wing and sports science department for treating player injuries and assisting in recuperation, with treatment rooms and offices for; doctors, physiotherapists, sports scientists, sports psychologists, statisticians and dieticians. The facility was supplied with £13 million worth of medical equipment by Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, as part of their sponsorship with the club, and the medical centre is fitted with x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound scanners, as well as other high-tech screening equipment normally reserved for hospitals. This means Manchester United has become the first European football club with the ability to complete player medicals in-house at the training ground, to avoid public and media attention. As part of the investment, the club also opened a new media centre (named the Jimmy Murphy Centre), upgraded its ground staff compound, car parks, and constructed a new security centre on the campus. =Outdoor facilities= The site covers a total area of , of which 85 acres are used by the club. On the grounds, there are a total of 14 football pitches of varying sizes; 12 of which are grass pitches (with drainage, irrigation sprinklers, under-soil heating and floodlights), one full-size outdoor floodlit and heated AstroTurf all-weather pitch, one full-size indoor floodlit and heated AstroTurf artificial pitch and a special goalkeeper training area. Desso GrassMaster playing surfaces are used, the same surface as the pitch at Old Trafford. There is a helipad at the structure. The unused 23 acres of remaining land includes a small nature reserve, maintained by the club and the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. There are two ponds which are used as part of the waste water treatment system. =Security= Carrington is considered one of the most secretive and secure sports training facilities in Europe. The media and locals have dubbed the complex \\"Fortress Carrington\\", due to the security measures in place at the grounds. There is a long, 8 metre (26 feet) high security wall, video surveillance cameras, intrusion detection systems, and over 30,000 trees have been planted surrounding the site, rendering it impossible to see into the premises. The complex is manned 24/7 by a security team, who conduct roaming patrols, in order to prevent members of the media and opposition spies from gaining access to team practice sessions for upcoming matches. Fans are prohibited from entering the facility, and are also banned from requesting autographs and photographs from professional players outside it. During the season, the media is allowed into the complex only once a week when the manager briefs the press before games, and they are only ever allowed to take photographs and videos of the team training ahead of home Champions League or Europa League fixtures – due to UEFA regulations – and for just 15 minutes. Since 2005, the campus has been regularly swept for audio and video recording bugs by security personnel. There are no road signs or markings indicating the existence of the complex. There are a number of entrances into the complex, all guarded by security barriers and manned by security staff. There is also a helipad at the training ground, used for player medicals and transfers, and by the club's owners, the Glazer family. Sponsorship In April 2013, Manchester United announced an eight-year naming rights agreement with Aon plc that would see the Trafford Training Centre renamed as the Aon Training Complex until 2021. The deal has been estimated to be worth £180 million (£22.5 million per-year), three times the club's outlay on the training complex itself (£60 million). Toshiba Medical Systems, as part of their five- year sponsorship agreement with the club, provided £13 million of medical systems to the complex in 2013.

Like a typical offspring of a wealthy family, Kendo is emotionally abandoned by his busy father, who sees money as an end to solve problems and provide happiness for his son. However, with Kendo’s future appearing bleaker by the day – in the midst of failing school and frequent school brawls – his father sends him abroad to Melbourne. They say when one door closes, another one opens – and this is especially true in Kendo’s case. In a surprising turn of events, Kendo then manages to befriend several people with a mutual passion and talent for music and together they form a band. Also, against his own expectations, Kendo finds himself incredibly gripped by Natalia, a sweet and religious girl whose personality is an exact antithesis of himself. Yet, due to Kendo’s headstrong nature and bitter upbringing, he undoubtedly clashes with his friends and band members. But when all hope feels lost, Natalia introduces him to a single force that will subsequently transform his life – God. Problems may never cease to appear, but with God he can face them more courageously than before. But will he be able to ever forgive his neglecting father?

Under the same act, twelve is the youngest possible age at which a person can be charged with a crime; convicts who were under fourteen years of age at the time they committed a crime cannot be sentenced as adults, and cannot be given more than a ten-year sentence. On July 9, 2007, Richardson, who had by then turned 13, was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder in the killings. She is believed to be the youngest person ever convicted of a multiple murder in Canada. On November 8, 2007, she was sentenced to the maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. Her sentence included credit for eighteen months already spent in custody, to be followed by four years in a psychiatric institution and four-and-a-half years under conditional supervision in the community. In September 2011, Richardson began attending classes at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta during the final years of her sentence.Child Murderer Facing November Release She was released from a ten-year sentence at a psychiatric hospital in the fall of 2011, and in October 2012 it was reported her rehabilitation was going well, and she expressed remorse for her actions that experts considered genuine.

He was tried in November 2008 and found guilty by a jury on three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of the three Richardson victims. On December 15, 2008, Steinke was sentenced to three life sentences, one for each first-degree murder count.

Port Disney was part of the \\"Disney Decade\\" expansion plan in the 1990s as a proposed alternative by WestCOT to add a \\"second gate\\" to the Disneyland Resort complex in Anaheim, California.

Plans for DisneySea ceased in December 1991, and the WestCOT plan was pursued on the site of the former Disneyland parking lot, now known as Disney California Adventure. Some of the concepts proposed for DisneySea were used for Tokyo DisneySea, which opened in 2001. Oceana A two-storey aquarium, called Oceana, was intended to be the park's centrepiece. Its purpose was educational, allowing guests to experience recreations of marine habitats through interactive displays. =Future Research Center= This centre was planned to feature interactive exhibits and a working laboratory within Oceana similar to The Living Seas pavilion and The Land pavilion at Walt Disney World's Epcot.

A revised version of Mysterious Island, including the planned volcano, was eventually built at Tokyo DisneySea. =Heroes' Harbor= Heroes' Harbor (later renamed to Hero's Harbor) was planned to explore the stories behind legendary and mythical adventurers, with an entrance through Aqua-labyrinth, a maze whose walls were made of water: =Boardwalk and Fleets of Fantasy= A boardwalk and amusement rides reminiscent of The Pike would be built adjacent to Fleets of Fantasy, featuring rides and dining onboard historical replica ships. Elements of both were later incorporated as the American Waterfront land at Tokyo DisneySea, including the SS Columbia moored in the American Waterfront's New York Harbor, similar to how RMS Queen Mary would have been relocated as a focal element of DisneySea. Paradise Pier at Disney California Adventure also includes representative California beach/boardwalk amusement rides. =Venture Reefs= Other planned themed environments featured cultures with strong ties to the water and a shark-diving experience. At the time, these attractions did not have a name, but they were later collectively named Venture Reefs in the 1991 Port Disney News. Shark Reef, an attraction at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon at Walt Disney World, also featured snorkeling and shark interactions at saltwater reefs. =Port Disney News (1991) updates= At the time of the publication of the Port Disney News (1991), Walt Disney Imagineering still had not finalized the list of green lighted lands.

Vitis vinifera) which today is primarily grown in the upstream parts of the Mosel region in Germany and in Luxembourg, where the river is called Moselle. The variety has a long history, and used to cover much of Germany's vineyards from medieval times and was that country's most cultivated variety until the early 20th century, but has been in decline ever since. As of 2006, there were of Elbling vineyards in Germany, which made it the country's 23rd most grown variety of grape. Of that vineyard surface, 575 ha or 98.6% was found in the Mosel regionGerman Wine Institute: German Wine Statistics 2007-2008 In the same year, there were of Elbling grown in Luxembourg.Le Portail des Statistiques du Luxembourg: Superficies viticoles selon les différents cépages 1975 - 2006, accessed on April 1, 2008 History and origin It has been speculated that Elbling was grown along Mosel already in Roman times, and that it could even be identical to the Vitis albuelis described by Lucius Columella in his De re rustica and the Vitis alba described by Pliny the Elder, although this has by no means been proven. Both Latin names mean \\"the white grape\\" and would then have been corrupted to Elbling at some later stage. DNA profiling has indicated that Elbling is an offspring of Gouais blanc (also known as Heunisch) and a cross between Traminer and some unidentified variety.Wein-Plus Glossar: Elbling read on March 6, 2013 This parentage is consistent with Elbling being an ancient grape variety, and incidentally, it is the same parentage as for Riesling. This parentage and history makes it likely that Elbling originated somewhere in the Rhine area. Wines Elbling tends to give musts low in sugar, and wines high in acid and fairly neutral in character, which makes it primarily used for sparkling wine, such as non-varietally labelled Mosel Sekt. When made into varietal still wine, it gives a wine which has been compared to a lighter and more tart version of Silvaner.Jancis Robinson (Ed.), The Oxford Companion to Wine, 3rd Ed., 2006, Oxford University Press, , p. 250: \\"Elbling\\" Varietal Elbling wine is most commonly found in Luxembourg.

Their school colors were Maroon & White and their mascot was the Bulldogs. History  Central High School, located on Morris Street, opened in 1906 and served Durham city's white high school students until 1922. This building then was converted to Durham's City Hall, and is now the home of the Durham Arts Council. Durham High School replaced Central High School in 1922, on property that once belonged to Brodie L. Duke. During racial segregation, Durham High School was a high school for whites in the city of Durham. The high school for African Americans was Hillside High School. In 1959, Durham High School began integration under then Superintendent of Schools, Lew W. Hannen. In 1959-60 African Americans Joycelyn McKissick, a senior, and Claudette Brame, a junior, enrolled. Located next to Durham High School, was Central Junior High School, which opened in 1926. The building was later renamed Julian S. Carr Junior High School in 1945. The junior high became part of the Durham High School campus in the fall of 1975, when the school district expanded high schools to include grade 9. (Prior to that year, Durham junior highs included grades 7-9 and high schools served grades 10-12.) By the 1980s, Durham High School was no longer a majority white school. In 1992, the Durham City and County School Districts merged to become Durham Public Schools. Durham High School would close as a traditional high school in 1995. In 1995, Durham Magnet Center for Visual and Performing Arts opened, and was later renamed Durham School of the Arts. The former Durham High School campus now makes up part of the Durham School of the Arts campus, along with the site of the former Carr Middle School. The former Durham High School auto shop, is now Durham School of the Art's Black Box Theatre.

Whether the earliest Church Fathers believed in the Trinity is a subject for debate. Some of the evidence used to support an early belief in the Trinity are triadic statements (referring to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit) from the New Testament and the Church Fathers. The view that the Son was 'of the substance of the Father, God of God...very God of very God' was formally ratified at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. The Holy Spirit was included at the First Council of Constantinople (381 AD), where the relationship between the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as one substance (ousia) and three co-equal persons (hypostaseis) was formally ratified. Introduction Some Trinitarians say the doctrine of the Trinity was revealed in New Testament times; others, that it was revealed in the Patristic period. Nontrinitarians, on the other hand, will generally state that the traditional doctrine of the Trinity did not exist until centuries after the end of the New Testament period.Jeff Rath, An Appeal to Trinitarian Christians: Historical Background of the Trinity, online (accessed 24/12/2013) Some Trinitarians agree with this, seeing a development over time towards a true understanding of the Trinity.J. N. D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines 5th edn (London: A&C; Black, 1977), p. 87-88,90 Trinitarians sometimes refer to Christian belief about God before the traditional statements on the Trinity as unsophisticated, 'naive',J. N. D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines 5th edn (London: A&C; Black, 1977), p. 90 or 'incipient Trinitarianism',M. Turner and G. McFarlane, 'Trinity' in I. H. Marshall (ed.), et al., New Bible Dictionary (3rd edn), electronic edition and that early Christians were 'proto-Trinitarian, partially Trinitarian', etc.Dale Tuggy, The Lost Early History of Unitarian Christian Theology, paper delivered at CoGGC Theological Conference, Atlanta [May, 2013], 4:43-56 Unitarians and some Trinitarians would state that this means that those early Christians were not actually Trinitarians.Charles Morgridge, The true believer's defence against charges preferred by Trinitarians (1837), p. 162 Expressions which link together the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit occurred very early in the History of the Christian Church. These are sometimes taken as expressions about the Trinity. Other times, they are referred to more generally as 'triadic'.J. N. D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines 5th edn (London: A&C; Black, 1977), p. 88-89 It is stated by some that 'These passages cannot immediately be taken as evidence of the belief in the co-substantial unity of God; names may be conjoined for any number of reasons (e.g. unity in greeting, unity of purpose, etc.) so even the use of a threefold formula cannot be conclusive'.Thomas Gaston (2007), Proto-Trinity: The Development of the Doctrine of the Trinity in the First and Second Christian Centuries. MPhil(b). Thesis. University of Birmingham, UK. p. 69 Two examples appear in the New Testament: and . The context of 2 Corinthians 13:14 (verse 13 in the Vulgate and the NRSV), which is the close of a letter, suggests the church's conjunction of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit may have originated as a doxological formula; while the context of Matthew 28:19, the Great Commission, shows that the verbal conjunction of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit was used early on as a baptismal formula. Unitarians hold that 'the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are mentioned together [in the New Testament] in the same context, but not in any way that suggests they are all distinct persons who together comprise the totality of God';David Burke, 'The Great Trinity Debate: Week 5: Father, Son and Holy Spirit' available online here and here (accessed 24/12/2013) a 'literary triad does not equate to an ontological triunity'.David Burke, 'The Great Trinity Debate: Week 5: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Rebuttal' online (accessed 24/12/2013) This triadic pattern is even more marked in the glimpses available of the early Church's liturgy and day- to-day catechetical practice.J. N. D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines A & C Black 1965 (1965) p.88 Even so, some have said that the 'indications from the apostolic and sub-apostolic writers are that [their] triadic formulas...do not carry the same significance as post-Nicene triadic formulas'. The oldest extant work in which the word \\"Trinity\\" itself (Greek Trias, triados) is used is Theophilus of Antioch's 2nd-century To Autolycus. There it is used to refer to God, his word and his wisdom.'...the three days before the luminaries were created are types of the Trinity, God, his Word, and his Wisdom'. To Autolycus 2:15 The view that the Son was 'of the essence of the Father, God of God...very God of very God' was formally ratified at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The Holy Spirit was included at the First Council of Constantinople (381 CE), where the relationship between the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as one substance (ousia) and three co-equal persons (hypostaseis) was formally ratified. Second century =Early second century: Ignatius of Antioch= Ignatius, second bishop of Antioch, who was martyred in Rome around 110 AD,Eusebius of Caesarea, Church History iii.36 wrote a series of letters to churches in Asia Minor on his way to be executed in Rome. The conjunction of Father, Son and Holy Spirit appears in his letter to the Magnesian church: Unitarians would argue that Ignatius is not indicating that the Father, the Son and the Spirit 'are one substance anymore than he is saying flesh and spirit are one substance'.Thomas Gaston (2007), Proto-Trinity: The Development of the Doctrine of the Trinity in the First and Second Christian Centuries. MPhil(b). Thesis. University of Birmingham, UK. p. 72 =First half of second century or late first century: Didache= This source uses the Gospel of Matthew only and no other known Gospel, and thus it must have been written before the four-Gospel canon had become widespread in the churches, i.e. before the second half of the 2nd century when Tatian produced the Diatessaron.Date according to Metzger, Bruce. The Canon of the New Testament. 1997 Given its literary dependence on the Gospel of Matthew, it is not surprising that the Didache follows the Gospel of Matthew in designating the a triadic formula as the baptismal formula:Thomas Gaston (2007), Proto-Trinity: The Development of the Doctrine of the Trinity in the First and Second Christian Centuries. MPhil(b). Thesis. University of Birmingham, UK. p. 70 =ca. 155: Polycarp of Smyrna= Polycarp was martyred in Smyrna (where he was also Bishop) in the year 155. It is said by Irenaeus of Lyons that he was a pupil of the Apostle John. In his final prayer before his martyrdom, he \\"praises, glorifies, and blesses\\" the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: =169-181: Theophilus of Antioch= Theophilus of Antioch's Ad Autolycum is the oldest extant work that uses the actual word \\"Trinity\\" to refer to God, his Word and his Wisdom. The context is a discussion of the first three days of creation in Genesis 1-3: It is maintained by some that 'Theophilus does not use τρίας to mean ‘three-in-one’, but rather simply uses it to indicate that there were three things before man, God and His Word and His Wisdom';Thomas Gaston (2007), Proto-Trinity: The Development of the Doctrine of the Trinity in the First and Second Christian Centuries. MPhil(b). Thesis. University of Birmingham, UK. p. 74 that he, like other second and third century authors, was referring to 'a “trinity”, triad or threesome, but not a triune or tripersonal God'. Third century: Theology in response to Patripassianism and Sabellianism In the early 3rd century Tertullian and Hippolytus of Rome wrote Against Praxeas and Against Noetus, respectively, which are sometimes considered the first extant expository treatments of Trinitarian theology.Kerry D. McRoberts, 'The Holy Trinity' in Stanley M. Horton (ed.), Systematic Theology (Revised edn), (Springfield, MO: Logion, 2012), p. 157 Both authors use the word Trinity (Latin: Trinitas; Greek: Trias), but the term was yet to have its Trinitarian meaning.D. Tuggy, 'History of Trinitarian Doctrines' (2013) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: 'The terms we translate as “Trinity” (Latin: trinitas, Greek: trias) seem to have come into use only in the last two decades of the second century; but such usage doesn't reflect trinitarian belief. These late second and third century authors use such terms not to refer to the one God, but rather to refer to the plurality of the one God, together with his Son (on Word) and his Spirit. They profess a “trinity”, triad or threesome, but not a triune or tripersonal God'.D. Tuggy (referring specifically to Tertullian) says, 'The word 'Trinity' has come to mean the tri-personal God, consisting of the eternal, equally divine Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is now used as a singular referring term for the one God, assumed to be tri-personal. But, both now and then [i.e., in the 2nd century], the word 'trinity' can simply refer to \\"these three\\", Father, son and Holy Spirit -- that is, it can be used as a plural referring term, and that usage of it does not imply the items mentioned are parts of a whole, or that they are in anyway equal, or that they even belong to the same kind or category. It refers simply to a triad, a triple, a group of three....Tertullian uses the word in this latter way. For him, the trinity is a triad, a group, a plurality, consisting of those three selves. This plurality is not God' (Dale Tuggy, 'Tertullian the unitarian' [4:03-4:13], paper delivered on September 20, 2013 at the conference Analytical Theology: Faith, Knowledge and the Trinity [Prague, Czech Republic]). They wrote these works to combat Patripassianism, the view that the Father suffered on the cross along with the Son. In the 3rd century there were also Trinitarian theologies expressed in writings against Monarchianism, Sabellianism and Modalism. =216: Tertullian= Tertullian's treatise against a Patripassian heretic named Praxeas, who claimed that the Father had suffered with the Son on the cross, is arguably the oldest extant treatise with a detailed explicit Trinitarian theology. In his Against Praxeas Tertullian wrote: Others, however, argue that Tertullian was unitarian,'...he believes the son to have been caused to exist by God a finite time ago. He tells us that God was not always a father, for there was a time when the son did not exist [Against Hermogenes, ch. 3]' (Dale Tuggy, 'Tertullian the unitarian' [10:54-11:04], paper delivered on September 20, 2013 at the conference Analytical Theology: Faith, Knowledge and the Trinity [Prague, Czech Republic]). claiming that Tertullian's use of the word \\"trinity\\" differs from later Trinitarian use: 'For Tertullian, the one God is not the Trinity; rather, the one God is a member of the trinity...';Dale Tuggy, The Lost Early History of Unitarian Christian Theology, paper delivered at CoGGC Theological Conference, Atlanta (May, 2013), 18:44-55 '...Tertullian's trinity [was] not a triune God, but rather a triad or group of three, with God as the founding member'. =ca. 220: Hippolytus of Rome= In the early 3rd century, Hippolytus of Rome wrote a treatise Against Noetus, in response to a Christian from Smyrna named Noetus who had been promoting Patripassian views, which Hippolytus deemed heretical. Noetus and other Patripassians, such as Praxeas (see above, in relation to Tertullian), claimed that the Father as well as the Son had suffered on the cross.Against Noetus Ch. 1 Like Tertullian, Hippolytus explicitly used the word Trinity in his treatise against Patripassian views: Some, referring to other parts of Against Noetus along with Hippolytus' The Refutation of All Heresies, view Hippolytus as nontrinitarian, saying that 'in his theology, the divine (but less divine than God) Logos came to exist from God a finite time ago, so that God could create the cosmos by means of him. On two counts, then, this makes him not a trinitarian –- that the “persons” are neither co-equal nor equally divine'.Dale Tuggy, 'trinitarian or unitarian? 10 – Hippolytus on the identity of the one God' (29/03/2012) on trinities.org (accessed 24/12/2013). Also see posts from 27/03/2013 and 03/04/2013. =ca. 225: Origen= Origen's On First Principles (De Principiis or Peri Archon) is the oldest extant Christian theological treatise. Origen's theology of the godhead is developed in this treatise, which reveals that by this time the use of the word Trinity to refer to Father, Son and Holy Spirit is standard in orthodox churches. However, it is argued that the word still did not have its later, Trinitarian meaning. But, it is also argued in contradistinction that the word Trinity is utilized with a very similar meaning to its fourth century use. > This is most clearly pointed out by the Apostle Paul, when demonstrating > that the power of the Trinity is one and the same, in the words, \\"There are > diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; there are diversities of > administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, > but it is the same God who worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the > Spirit is given to every man to profit: withal.\\" From which it most clearly > follows that there is no difference in the Trinity, but that which is called > the gift of the Spirit is made known through the Son, and operated by God > the Father. Some see Origen as holding what many scholars refer to as a \\"subordinist\\" Christology: in Origen, 'the Son and Spirit are always in some sense derivative of, less than, and subordinate to their source, the one God, that is, the Father':D. Tuggy, 'History of Trinitarian Doctrines' (2013) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy From this, it is argued that Origen was in fact unitarian. Others, however, see Origen as teaching the ineffable begetting of the Son and procession of the Spirit as the unity of power and operation. In this view the Son and Spirit have no less power than the Father, by virtue of literally being His power. Both the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds affirm the Son is begotten of, and the Spirit proceeding from, the Father, co- equally and co-eternally. =ca. 256: Novatian= Novatian, presbyter of Rome, wrote the oldest extant Christian treatise that is specifically dedicated to and entitled On the Trinity.Jerome, On Illustrious Men Ch. 70 It was written in response to a number of views deemed heretical by Novatian, and particularly against Sabellius, who had maintained that the Trinity was divided into three prosopa, or \\"characters by which God is revealed to man, the Trinity being one of revelation, not essence\\".J.E. Oulton, Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History Vol 2; (Cambridge, 1980 reprint; p. 143, n. 1). Some, referring to chapter 31 of On the Trinity, maintain that when Novatian referred to Christ as 'God' he was still excluding him from being 'the one true God'. =262: Pope Dionysius= According to Athanasius of Alexandria, in the mid-3rd century Pope Dionysius wrote a letter to Dionysius of Alexandria criticizing Sabellius's views on the relations between the Son and the Father, as well as some who attempted to refute Sabellius's views. He quotes parts of Dionysius' letter in On the decrees of the Council of Nicaea .Johannes Quasten, Patrology, Vol. 2, Utrecht, 1964, p. 239-241. In this letter it is clear that Dionysius used the word Trinity (Greek Trias) to explicate the relations between Father, Son and Holy Spirit: =265: Gregory the Wonderworker= Gregory was Bishop of Neocaesarea in Asia Minor,Jerome, On Illustrious Men Ch. 65 and wrote a Declaration of Faith which treats the Trinity as standard theological vocabulary:Basil of Caesarea discusses the occasion for Gregory writing this Declaration of Faith in Letter 205 References Trinitarianism * ","title":"Trinitarianism in the Church Fathers"},{"id":"13181578","text":"Raymond Herrell \\"Buddy\\" Barker (March 12, 1936 – May 29, 2018) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman who played in all or parts of four seasons for the Baltimore Orioles in 1960, the Cleveland Indians in 1965, and the New York Yankees from 1965 to 1967.

He married Sarah Chase, of the long-standing Cornish Chase family in 1796. Under his son, William, the farm prospered, producing milk for area creameries. The Sullivan County Railroad was constructed through the farm in 1849, with William Balloch serving as a contractor to the railroad. Starting in the 1890s, the Balloch station was built to ship this milk directly to processors, such as the Bellows Falls Cooperative Creamery.

As well as presenting many solo public performances and broadcasts of baroque keyboard music and participating in choral and orchestral performances, he has made numerous commercial CD recordings of solo harpsichord music from the 17th and 18th centuries. He specialises in the music of J. S. Bach, 17th-century French and German music, and the works of the English virginalist composers. He is widely recognised as an expert on the history of the early music revival during the 20th century. His biography of the Viennese harpsichordist Isolde Ahlgrimm (1914–95) was published by Ashgate in December 2007.  Biography  He first studied early keyboard performance with Margaret Lloyd in Newcastle, Australia, and then with Nancy Salas in Sydney during the 1970s. With Nancy Salas, he presented a series of 12 joint lecture-recitals on the second book of JS Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music. During the 1980s, he performed on harpsichord and chamber organ with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Australian period-instrument ensemble the Telemann Trio (with Owen Watkins, recorder and Margaret Waugh, cello). During this period, he worked closely with Melbourne instrument-maker Alastair McAllister on harpsichord design and construction, learning from McAllister advanced techniques of voicing, action set-up and the theory of harpsichord scaling and geometry. From 1980, he became the Australian representative for Frank Hubbard Harpsichords of Waltham, Massachusetts, and introduced their instruments to players and institutions throughout the east coast of Australia. From 1985 to 1992, he studied harpsichord performance in Vienna with Isolde Ahlgrimm, who had played a central role in developing the revival of interest in the use of period instruments for the performance of Baroque and Classical music. In 1985, he won the Erwin Bodky Award in the Bach section of the early-music performance competition in Boston.Peter Watchorn: short biography He has made Boston his base since joining the staff of Frank Hubbard in that city in 1987. In 1993, he joined the faculty of the Baroque Performance Institute, held every summer at Oberlin Conservatory, Ohio, as curator of keyboard instruments and adjunct keyboard faculty, where he regularly performed solo and in ensemble. He received the Doctor of Musical Arts degree in 1995 from Boston University with his dissertation A Performer's Guide to the English Suites of JS Bach. He taught harpsichord at Harvard University's Mather House during the late 1990s. He was a member of ensembles Concerto Armonico Wien (directed by Peter Matzka) and Concerto Armonico (with Owen Watkins, recorder and Geoffrey Burgess, baroque oboe). He continues in his role of continuo keyboardist and artistic advisor to Publick Musick—based in Rochester, New York and directed by Thomas Folan—and co-directed the Boston Bach Ensemble with Julian Wachner,Boston Bach Ensemble homepage accessed 24 August 2008 from 1995 to 2001. Peter Watchorn plays a harpsichord by Alastair McAllister, Melbourne, 1999, and a rare pedal harpsichord, by Hubbard & Broekman, Boston, 1990 In addition to instruments after French and Flemish originals, he has collaborated in the design and construction of Italian harpsichords with David Werbeloff in Boston, patterning them after the 1693 Italian (Giusti) in the Smithsonian Institution and the 1697 Grimaldi in Nürnberg, and has worked with the Boston-based painter and historian Sheridan Germann in production of both Flemish and French instruments. In 1993, he produced the first workshop drawing of the 1642 Hans Moermans (II)double-manual harpsichord in the J. Rodger Mirrey collection in London, a notable early example of the non-transposing Flemish two-manual instrument. The first modern copy was constructed by Zuckermann Harpsichords International in 2007, and is now housed at Oberlin Conservatory, Ohio, US.Peter Watchorn: short biography Peter Watchorn is co-founder (with David Fox) of the award-winning CD label Musica Omnia. He has served as executive producer for numerous releases by artists such as Max van Egmond, The Atlantis Trio & Ensemble (with Jaap Schroeder, Enid Sutherland and Penelope Crawford), Emlyn Ngai, Saskia Coolen, Sally Pinkas, Mahan Esfahani, Publick Musick, the Magnificat Ensemble and The Adaskin String Trio. With Emlyn Ngai he recorded (for Musica Omnia) JS Bach's six sonatas for violin and harpsichord. In 2008 he was appointed to the faculty of Boston College and teaches a Music of the Baroque class there.

The study provided compelling reasons why the Atlanta community was the right place for such a festival. Fulton County Government as the major sponsor, joined by additional corporate and foundation sponsors, the Festival's first biannual summer festival was held in 1988. Over the eighteen years of the festival, artists and attendees alike have come to expect the emerging and renowned artists to grace the stages and exhibition spaces of the city; collectors look eagerly to the Artists’ Market for their next opportunity to buy from some of the best artists in the country; film fans flock to the screenings of known and unknown work; concert halls are filled with the voices and instruments of those who are considered to be the standard bearers in jazz, gospel and everything in-between; the masters of the stage and screen have joined us over the years; and the writers who have preserved the voices of the African Diaspora in literature have blessed us with their presence. People of all ages and races have gathered together to bask in the presence of: Maya Angelou, Charles Dutton, Wynton Marsalis, Amiri Baraka, Avery Brooks, Nancy Wilson, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Spike Lee, Ousmane Sembène, Pearl Cleage, Kenny Leon, Carrie Mae Weems, Radcliffe Bailey, Sonia Sanchez and literally thousands of other artists from the USA and around the world. As the festival firmly established itself as one of the most important festivals in the World presenting the art and culture of the African Diaspora, it seized the opportunity to expand to year-round educational and humanities programming and hosting the Festival every year. With a regular presence the festival looks forward to continuing and strengthening its important ties with its many local, national and international partners. The Festival's success has been anchored by the willing and creative collaborations of local cultural institutions. This year alone there are over 40 independently produced programs; without them side by side, the festival's energy and ability to reach so many–the young and old in every corner of the country–would be dramatically diminished. And the commitment of the festival's various artistic leadership: Avery Brooks, Dwight Andrews and Stephanie Hughley have allowed the breadth and reach of the festivals to touch over five million people since the first Festival. Each artistic director brought their own ideas and energy, building on the vision of their colleagues across the diaspora.

He was born in Roncade, Province of Treviso. At the age of 19 years, he came to London and apprenticed with Francesco Bartolozzi, an engraver from Florence, then in England. Cendramini married an English wife and in 1805 was invited to Russia and patronized by the emperor.

Though he has written essays on topics as diverse as obesity and political campaigns, he is best known for his first book, published by ECW Press, when he was just 24: Code Blue: Reviving Canada's Health Care System. That book won the Donner Prize established by the Donner Canadian Foundation and was a national bestseller in his native Canada. Gratzer is a critic of the Canadian health care system, and of U.S. President Barack Obama's health care reform proposals. Gratzer was health care policy advisor to Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign. Early life Gratzer born September 5, 1974 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Gratzer's father, George, is a professor of mathematics at the University of Manitoba who emigrated from Hungary to the United States in 1963 and to Canada in 1966. Gratzer's mother, Catherine, is a retired dentist. Gratzer's older brother earned his medical degree and now practices in the United States as a psychiatrist. Gratzer earned a B.Sc. at the University of Manitoba in 1996, was president of the University of Manitoba Students' Union (UMSU) during his final undergraduate year 1995–1996, and was appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba to the University of Manitoba Board of Governors for four successive years from 1994 to 1998. In his early years, Gratzer was not particularly interested in health policy issues. As he noted later:Gratzer D. The Cure. Speech to the Heritage Foundation. 2006 October 18. Medical school and Code Blue (1999) Gratzer attended medical school at the University of Manitoba from 1996 to 2000 and earned an M.D. in 2000. On November 15, 1996, during his first year of medical school, the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) published a letter to the editor from Gratzer criticizing a June 15, 1996 CMAJ report comparing reserve funds held by the Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA) to those held by medical malpractice insurers in the United States. While in medical school, Gratzer was a regular contributor of opinion columns to National Post, wrote a weekly opinion column for the London Free Press and the Halifax Sunday Herald, and wrote columns on health care that appeared in several major newspapers and magazines, including the Toronto Star and Ottawa Citizen and Calgary Herald. A 1997 Gratzer column \\"Being a young conservative is nothing to apologize for\\" said \\"I am a conservative. This is somewhat unfortunate, as people don't seem to understand how anyone under 40 can be right-wing.\\" A 1999 Gratzer column \\"Raising the minimum wage hurts the poor it hopes to help\\" lamented that even \\"two of Canada's three right-leaning governments have chosen to hike their minimum wages\\" and that \\"minimum wage earners are not underpaid but underproductive\\" Gratzer won $250 as fourth place runner-up in 1998–1999 and won $2,500 as first prize in the 1999–2000 Felix Morley Journalism Competition of the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University for his newspaper columns. During his second year of medical school, Gratzer began writing a book about problems with the Canadian health care system but could not get anyone interested. Rejection letters piled up after he completed the book and he had doubts about his ability to get taken seriously until his third year of medical school, when Robert Lecker, professor of English at McGill University and co-founder of ECW Press agreed to publish his book. In August 1999, during his fourth year of medical school, ECW Press published the 24-year-old Gratzer's first book, Code Blue: Reviving Canada's Health Care System Gratzer wrote about deficiencies in Canadian health care and argued that they were the direct result of the system's design, and thus not amendable to simple reforms. Gratzer called for market-based reforms. He won praise from a former Member of Parliament, Stephen Harper, who wrote: \\"Gratzer proposes a workable solution for the biggest public policy problem of the coming generation—government-controlled health care monopoly… Canada needs Gratzer’s solution.\\" Harper later became the Prime Minister of Canada. On May 4, 2000, Gratzer was awarded $25,000 by the Donner Canadian Foundation as winner of its second annual Donner Prize for best public policy book of 1999 for Code Blue. Residency and Better Medicine (2002) In June 2000, Gratzer graduated from medical school and in July 2000 began a five-year psychiatry residency program at the University of Toronto. During his psychiatry residency, Gratzer continued to write newspaper opinion columns. A 2001 Gratzer column \\"Make room for prescription drug ads on television\\" advocated allowing direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs on television in Canada (the United States and New Zealand are the only countries that allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs). In April 2002, ECW Press published Better Medicine: Reforming Canadian Health Care a book of essays edited by Gratzer. The collection of essays had 17 contributors from 3 countries and 2 continents. Essayists included historian Michael Bliss and columnist Margaret Wente. Dr. Victor Dirnfeld, a physician and former president of the Canadian Medical Association, wrote the introduction. Gratzer co-wrote an essay on market reforms seen in various European countries, and also wrote the concluding essay on medical savings accounts. In September 2002, Gratzer was one of 25 Canadians under age 30 featured in a Maclean's \\"Leaders of Tomorrow\\" cover story. In 2002, while still a psychiatry resident, Gratzer joined the Manhattan Institute as a senior fellow. In 2004, Gratzer was first author of a peer-reviewed brief report \\"Lifetime rates of alcoholism in adults with anxiety, depression, or co-morbid depression/anxiety: a community survey of Ontario\\" published in the Journal of Affective Disorders. On June 28, 2005, Gratzer testified in support of H.R. 2355, the Health Care Choice Act of 2005, at a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Health of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Independent practice and The Cure (2006) On June 30, 2005, Gratzer completed his University of Toronto psychiatry residency and became registered for independent practice of medicine in Ontario. In April 2006, Gratzer became licensed to practice medicine in Pennsylvania. In May 2006, Gratzer became board-certified in psychiatry. In October 2006, Encounter Books published Gratzer's book, The Cure: How Capitalism Can Save American Health Care, about problems with the United States health care system. The book advocated moving health-care decisions closer to individuals and their families. Gratzer cited health savings accounts as a success story and bemoaned the state of health care in countries with government-run systems. He advocated various reforms: Gratzer proposed turning over all current federal funding for Medicaid to state governments in the form of block grants to experiment with, using welfare reform as a model; tightening Medicaid eligibility for long-term care; expanding health savings accounts; and encouraging the purchase of private long term care insurance. In the last chapter, he proposed more far-reaching reforms while acknowledging that neither political party would currently advocate them: # \\"Making Health Insurance Portable\\": ending the tax exemption of employer-provided health insurance and scrapping government regulations mandating what conditions and whom and at what rates private health insurance companies must provide coverage, thereby making it easier for families to purchase health insurance through their employer, their union, or their church; # \\"Shoring up Medicare\\": pre-funding the program (either through individual accounts or a trust fund), and raising the Medicare eligibility age to 70; # \\"Creating a Market for Medical Progress\\": ending the FDA's requirement that drugs demonstrate \\"efficacy\\", and return to only requiring pre-marketing demonstration of safety. The Foreword was written by Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman. He wrote: \\"David Gratzer is a practicing psychiatrist who combines firsthand knowledge of medical practice in both his native Canada and the U.S. with an independent point of view and a rare capacity for lucid exposition of complex technical material... If you want a well-written, interesting yet authoritative and thorough account of what is wrong with medicine today and how to cure American health care, this is the book for you.\\" The Cure was named a \\"Top Ten Reading Selection for 2007\\" by the National Chamber Foundation. 2008 campaign and beyond On July 30, 2007, Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign named Gratzer as one of his five key health care policy advisors, along with Hoover Institution senior fellow Dan Kessler, Hoover Institution senior fellow Scott Atlas, Pacific Research Institute president and CEO Sally Pipes, and The Moran Company founder and president Donald Moran. During the campaign, Giuliani championed interstate health-insurance markets and tax parity for non-employer purchases of health insurance, both positions favored by Gratzer. Giuliani said that his chance of surviving prostate cancer was 82% in the US, but only 44% under socialized medicine in England. Giuliani got his facts from the Manhattan Institute, in an article by Gratzer.Where Would You Rather Be Sick? David Gratzer. City Journal. June 15, 2006 Many cancer experts said that Gratzer was wrong, because he incorrectly compared survival statistics.Giuliani’s Prostate Cancer Figure Is Disputed, By JULIE BOSMAN, New York Times, OCT. 31, 2007THE CLAIM: GIULIANI'S PROGNOSIS WOULD BE WORSE IN BRITAIN. Washington Post, October 31, 2007A Bogus Cancer Statistic. Giuliani falsely claims that only 44 percent of prostate cancer patients survive under \\"socialized medicine\\" in England. By Lori Robertson. October 30, 2007 Gratzer responded by citing economist John Goodman, co-founder and president of the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA), by economist June O'Neill, and by U.S. Constitutional historian and health policy expert Betsy McCaughey, a former John M. Olin fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Gratzer also cited a September 2007 Lancet Oncology article which he said found superior cancer outcomes in the United States for 16 cancers when compared to European countries. After Giuliani withdrew, Gratzer endorsed the McCain health-care proposal. Gratzer testified several times during the recent health-care reform debates, including before the House Budget and Ways and Means Committees. In a June 2009 U.S. Congressional hearing on the issue of single-payer health care, Gratzer and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) clashed over Canadian healthcare statistics. According to a June 29, 2009 front-page article in Canada's National Post, \\"armed with a stack of statistics about patient wait lists in Canada, and a fusillade of dire warnings about the life- threatening consequences of government-managed care,\\" Gratzer \\"has emerged as the go-to expert witness for GOP lawmakers hoping to sow doubt in Congress about the wisdom of embracing Mr. Obama's call for a public health insurance option to compete with private insurers.\\" In July 2009, he appeared on 20/20 to discuss health care.https://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=8227482 In November 2009, Encounter Books published a short book of his criticism of the White House plans, How Obama’s Government Takeover of Health Care Will Be a Disaster. Gratzer continues to comment and debate on health-care issues. He is founding contributor to both FrumForum (formerly NewMajority) and the Canadian version of the Huffington Post. With former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, he debated at the Munk Debates. More recent work has focused on obesity. In a widely reprinted Los Angeles Times piece, he argued that society was suffering from a McVictim Syndrome with \\"[t]oo many pundits, public health experts and politicians are working overtime to find scapegoats for America's obesity epidemic.\\" He rejects this: \\"governments can't micromanage your waistline for you. Even if governments could magically walk you to work, ban food advertising, regulate sugar out of food and suck those fat particles out of the air, in a free society you would still have the power to drive to the nearest restaurant, shake your salt shaker and order a second piece of pie. That's why understanding—and rejecting—the McVictim culture is crucial to obesity reduction policy.\\" Works (editor) * Paperback edition (May 2008) .

Education and early career Judge Paul was born in Jacksonville, Florida in 1932. He grew up in a family of modest means at the height of the Great Depression and World War II. Starting when he was a young boy, he worked a variety of jobs to help his family. He delivered groceries by bicycle, worked summers at a pig farm in Georgia, picked fruit, delivered papers and gathered cans and bottles to make ends meet. Eventually, he made his way to the University of Florida where he received his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree from the University of Florida in 1954. While at the University of Florida, he participated in Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and, upon graduation, he served in the United States Air Force from 1954 to 1957, training in Nevada and California and eventually piloting bombers in the Strategic Air Command's atomic bomb fleet based in Riverside, California. During his time in the Air Force, he married Eleanor James Paul, his inseparable companion until her death in June 2012. She was an emergency room nurse until 1963, when their son, James Jeffrey Paul, was born. James Jeffrey Paul was an author living in Orlando, Florida, and New York City. After leaving the Air Force, Paul was admitted to the University of Florida College of Law, receiving his Bachelor of Laws, with honors and Order of the Coif in 1960. Paul then served as an interim instructor at the University of Florida College of Law in 1960. Private legal practice In 1961, Judge Paul moved to Orlando and spent a dozen years in private practice, working at Sanders, McEwan as an associate until becoming a partner at Akerman, Senterfitt in 1965. After that, he became a name partner in Pitts, Eubanks, Ross & Paul before going out on his own. Notably, Judge Paul was involved in creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the immediate governing jurisdiction for the land of the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. The district was conceived to have almost total autonomy within its borders, to allow Walt Disney to carry out his plans with more independence. Services such as land use regulation and planning, building codes, surface water control, drainage, waste treatment, utilities, roads, bridges, fire protection, emergency medical services and environmental services were overseen by the district, and the only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state were property taxes and elevator inspections. State judicial service Judge Paul was a circuit judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit of Florida from 1973 to 1982. In 1976, Judge Paul presided over the controversial murder trial of William \\"Tommy\\" Zeigler, who was accused of a quadruple murder in his furniture store on Christmas Eve, 1975, in Winter Garden, Florida.Orlando Sentinel, June 13, 2016 The jury found Zeigler guilty and recommended life imprisonment, but Paul overruled the jury's recommendation of a life sentence and sentenced Zeigler to death.Fatal Flaw by Phillip Finch, May 9, 1995 The Florida Supreme Court, in a detailed 17-page opinion, affirmed the conviction, opining that \\"[t]he facts supporting the sentence of death are clear, convincing, and are established beyond a reasonable doubt.\\"Zeigler v. State, 402 So. 2d 365, 377 (Fla. 1981). Despite this ruling, Zeigler and his supporters have provided a steady stream of arguments calling into question the actions of the judiciary, state prosecutors and police.Fatal Flaw by Phillip Finch, May 9, 1995. Page 251Tampa Bay Times, February 22, 2014Investigation Discovery, A QUESTION OF INNOCENCE, July 11, 2014.Unsolved Mysteries January 31, 1997 Zeigler's supporters argue that Judge Paul did not recuse himself even though shortly before the murders, Judge Paul and Zeigler had been character witnesses on opposing sides of another contentious case in which Zeigler's side won.Fatal Flaw by Phillip Finch, May 9, 1995. Page 94, 152, 153, 267 In 1984, the Florida Supreme Court held that Zeigler had procedurally defaulted this claim because he could have raised it by the close of the trial but did not.Zeigler v. State, 452 So. 2d 537, 539 (Fla. 1984). Other arguments include that the murder investigation was complicated and the trial rushed and complicated, that the verdict was returned only after Judge Paul, without the defense team's knowledge,Unsolved Mysteries January 31, 1997 (Attorney Terry Hadley, Irma Brickle interviews) arranged for the hold-out juror's doctor to prescribe her Valium, and that a statement by Judge Paul during a conversation between the government and Judge Paul revealed bias on the part of Judge Paul. In 1984, the Florida Supreme Court held that all but two of these arguments—one involving an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel and the other involving the allegation of judicial bias based on Judge Paul's conversation with the government—were procedurally defaulted because they were presented and rejected on direct appeal, or could have been presented, at trial or on direct appeal, but were not. The Court rejected the ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the merits and then remanded the judicial bias claim for an evidentiary hearing. After an evidentiary hearing, Circuit Judge R. James Stoker (who replaced Judge Paul upon the latter's appointment to the federal bench) denied the judicial bias claim. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the denial of that claim, agreeing with the following statement by Judge Stoker: \\"the testimony of the sole source of the allegation, Leigh McEachern, is not credible and therefore Petitioner has not proven his claim. The Court finds as a matter of fact that the alleged meeting did not take place and thus the alleged statement was not made.\\"Zeigler v. State, 473 So. 2d 203, 204 (Fla. 1985) Mr. Zeigler also sought DNA testing and was granted it in 2001.Zeigler v. State, 967 So. 2d 125, 127 (Fla. 2007) After reviewing the DNA evidence, the circuit court denied Zeigler's motion under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed, holding that \\"[t]he trial court's findings of fact are supported by competent, substantial evidence in the record, particularly the evidentiary hearing testimony of the blood stain expert and the DNA testing analyst as well as the 1976 trial testimony of Zeigler and the original blood stain expert.\\"Zeigler v. State, 967 So. 2d 125, 130 (Fla. 2007) Today, over 40 years after his conviction, Zeigler remains on Florida's death row still proclaiming his innocence and fighting for renewed DNA testing.Latest Appeal to the Florida Supreme Court http://tommyzeiglerisinnocent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Notice-of- appeal.pdfTampa Bay Times July 3, 2015 His latest petition seeking DNA testing using current DNA testing techniques was denied by the United States Supreme Court on November 13, 2017. Federal judicial service Judge Paul was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on April 26, 1982, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida vacated by Judge Winston E. Arnow. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 18, 1982, and received commission on June 21, 1982. He served as Chief Judge from 1993 to 1997. Several of his federal cases attracted considerable media attention. For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Judge Paul heard the case of the Rodriguez brothers, who recruited boat captains and crew, airplane pilots, off-loaders and truck drivers to bring more than 100,000 pounds of marijuana and 10,000 pounds of cocaine from across the Caribbean into waterfront mansions in Florida. During the trial of one co-conspirator, witnesses opined that this operation was the background for the show \\"Miami Vice.\\" In 2011, Judge Paul ordered Dixie County to remove a 6-ton stone monument listing the Ten Commandments from the steps of the county courthouse. Beneath the commandments, the monument reads in large capital letters, \\"LOVE GOD AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS.\\" In his order, Judge Paul said, \\"The actual ownership of the monument, the location and permanent nature of the display make it clear to all reasonable observers that Dixie County chooses to be associated with the message being conveyed.\\" In 1996, in a case involving French drug kingpin Claude Duboc, Judge Paul found famed attorney F. Lee Bailey in contempt of court, causing Bailey to spend 44 days in jail. Duboc had sold drugs worth hundreds of millions of dollars and had hidden the money in assets all around the world. To support his cooperation with the government, Duboc was to turn over all his ill-gotten assets. Bailey was given the authority to liquidate and turn over these assets to the government. A dispute arose over Bailey's use of certain stocks, and Judge Paul ordered Bailey to submit an accounting of the stocks. Bailey refused, despite being given multiple chances. Eventually, Bailey was disbarred by the Florida Supreme Court based on this conduct. He assumed senior status on July 31, 1997, serving in that status until his death on December 29, 2016, in Orlando. One case that garnered less media attention was his 2006 decision in Burkett v. Alachua County. This suit was brought on Alachua County and the officers and sheriff involved in the death of an African American high school student while in custody. In 2001, Ms. Burkett called 911 to seek medical attention for her son, Mark Burkett, who was exhibiting systems of mental health needs. Police were dispatched instead and when he resisted being put into the police car a struggle ensued and Mr. Burnett was instead placed into custody. Mr. Burnett continued to exhibit signs of the need for psychiatric care but was kept in jail overnight for a court appointment on charges of assaulting an officer and given a sedative. When it was time to move him, officers alleged he resisted transport and 5 officers entered his cell to subdue him. The officers admitted to using a taser and knee strikes during the struggle before pinning him to the ground and that at some point he became non-responsive. They then put him in a three point restraint before calling for medical attention. The county brought no charges against the officers. Ms. Burkett, representing herself and her family, filed a lawsuit against the county and officers involved in his death. Judge Paul granted a summary judgement to the Defendants, closing the case before it could reach trial. He cited a lack of evidence that excessive force was used and that the County and Sheriff could not be proven to have created an environment or training that led to the young man’s death. Death and legacy Upon his death in December 2016, Chief Judge Casey Rodgers shared the following in an email to the judges and staff in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida: > Judge Paul was a giant in both intellect and heart. He was a model judge, > and in fact, the one we all looked to for advice and guidance -- he was a > true judge's judge. His mentorship to us as judges and also to countless > lawyers over the years will never be forgotten. Most of all, he was a dear > friend and will be sorely missed.

All species in the genus are found in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans on reefs or rubble bottoms.

During courtship, the male and female \\"dance\\" around one another above the substrate. The female lays her eggs in a sheet, which she then presses against the underside of the male. The male will then grow skin over the eggs to form a brood pouch. Small pipefish hatch out of the eggs within a few weeks.

The cathedral was designed by Swiss architect Mario Botta. It opened in 1995, and was consecrated and dedicated to Saint Corbinian in 1996. Description The Diocese of Corbeil, also known as Corbeil-Essonnes,The name of the present town of Corbeil-Essonnes is spelt with a final -s; the name of the department Essonne in which the town is located is spelt without one was created in 1966, and the parish church of Saint-Spire was elevated to the status of the bishop's seat as Corbeil Cathedral, but neither it nor any other existing church was suitable in size and location, and the bishop's offices were in a converted primary school. Évry was the natural centre of the area and population of the new diocese and was accordingly chosen as the episcopal centre, but lacked a suitable significant structure. Twelve years later, in 1988, the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Évry–Corbeil-Essonnes and Évry Cathedral was commissioned from the Swiss architect Mario Botta. Initial studies were conceived the same year, and groundbreaking took place in the spring of 1991. He designed a strikingly contemporary cylindrical concrete tower, high, faced with 840,000 handmade red bricks crowned by a ring of trees around the edge of the roof. The altar was created from a single piece of white Carrara marble. Construction was funded by contributions from more than 300,000 donors, a national fund created between the two World Wars for the reconstruction of religious structures destroyed in the Paris region, a major contribution from the Diocese of Munich, Germany, and public agencies in the Île-de-France region. The building is the only completely new, purpose-built cathedral constructed in France in the 20th century.A number of new cathedrals have been created in the 20th century but apart from Évry they were all already in existence as churches or were reconstructions of previously existing buildings. As seat of the diocese, it has now superseded Corbeil Cathedral. Évry Cathedral opened its doors to the public on 11 April 1995, was dedicated on Easter 1996, and was visited by Pope John-Paul II on 22 August 1997. Self-directed tours of the cathedral with audioguides and group tours are available daily, including Sunday.

It was prepared by Friedrich Engels from notes left by Karl Marx and published in 1894.  Contents  Volume III is in seven parts: # The conversion of Surplus Value into Profit and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit # Conversion of Profit into Average Profit # The Law of the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall # Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital) # Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital. # Transformation of Surplus-Profit into Ground Rent. # Revenues and Their Sources The work is best known today for Part 3 which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the rate of profit tends to fall. This result which orthodox Marxists believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist orderChapther XV, Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law, § IV Supplementary Remarks. Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute. Moscow translation. p 263. \\"At any rate, it is but a requirement of the capitalist mode of production that the number of wage-workers should increase absolutely, in spite of its relative decrease. Labour-power becomes redundant for it as soon as it is no longer necessary to employ it for 12 to 15 hours a daily. A development of productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers, i.e. enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a shorter time span, would cause a revolution, because it would put the bulk of the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development. This collision appears partly in its periodical crises, which arise from the circumstances that now this and now that portion of the labouring population becomes redundant under its old mode of employment. The limit of capitalist production is the excess time of the labourers. The absolute spare time gained by society does not concern it. The development of productivity concerns it only in so far as it increases the surplus labour-time of the working class, not because it decreases the labour time for material production in general. It moves thus in a contradiction\\". The reference to hours worked per day reflects full employment norms of the 19th century. was held by Marx and Engels to—as a result of various contradictions in the capitalist mode of production—result in crises whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new mode of production as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of capitalism from prior forms.Chapter XV, Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law, § IV Supplementary Remarks. p. 264 ¶ 2. Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute. Moscow translation. \\"This transformation stems from the development of the productive forces under capitalist production, and from the ways and means by which this development takes place\\". Volume 3 is subtitled \\"The process of capitalist production as a whole\\" and is concerned primarily with the internal differentiation of the capitalist class. The first three parts are concerned with the division of surplus value amongst individual capitals, where it takes the form of profit. The following parts are concerned with merchants' capital, interest-bearing capital and landed capital. The last part draws the whole account together. The aim of the volume as a whole is to locate and describe the concrete forms which grow out of the movements of capital as a whole. Thus, the various forms of capital approach step by step the form which they assume on the surface of society in the action of different capitals on one another in competition and in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of production themselves (25) (Clarke).

Etymology The genus name Corythoichthys derives from the Greek words coris meaning \\"helmet\\" and ichthus meaning \\"fish\\". The specific name schultzi honors Leonard Peter Schultz, an American ichthyologist of the Smithsonian Institution (Washington). Description Corythoichthys schultzi at Hurghada, Red Sea Corythoichthys schultzi can reach a length up to in males. The body is cylindrical and very elongated. These pipefishes have a cryptic coloration making the difficult to be detected by both prey and predators. The basic color of the body is whitish, with small black, brown and reddish dashes and yellowish rings. The eyes are protruding and the snout is long, slightly compressed and thinner than the body. The caudal fin is present but quite small. Adults may form small aggregation. Ovoviviparous, the male carries the eggs in a brood pouch which is found under the tail. In this pouch they also carry the developing young pipefishes. Distribution This species is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific Oceans, from Red Sea and East Africa to Tonga, throughout Micronesia, northern Australia and New Caledonia. Habitat Schultz's pipefish is benthic species associated to coral reef. It usually can be found in lagoon and seaward reefs at depths between . The adults live in pairs or small groups when out in the open and find in safe places to spend the night.

Peris Brell's paintings are distinguished by the power of his technique for analysing and translating different light aspects, specially in landscapes genres, portrait and still life. Life Julio Peris Brell was a Valencian painter born in the street ‘En Bany’ of València, Spain, in a family of liberal tradition, of the small bourgeoisie. He began his studies of fine arts in 1876. In 1882, he was proclaimed secretary of the section of partners painters of the Scientific, Literary and Artistic Athenian of Valencia. He finished his studies of fine arts in 1884. In 1886, he becomes great partner of the Athenian, proposed by the painters Ignacio Pinazo Camarlench, Navarrese Jose Llorens and Honorio Romero Orozco. In 1890 he presents the work ‘The faith of the baptism’ in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in Madrid. He met the brothers Ricardo and Pío Baroja, with whom he maintained a long friendship. After the creation of the Circle of Beautiful Arts of Valencia, in 1894, Peris Brell participates in the activities with his friend, the painter Joaquín Agrasot, concurring to the first exhibitions of the organization. The biggest part of the Peris Brell's production, at the end of the 19th century, was directed to the Catalan market. In 1897 he presents the painting 'La Fuente ' to the National Exhibition of Fine Arts of Mexico, being acquired by the National School of Beautiful Arts of Mexico. It also participates in several exhibitions organized by the Academy of Fine Arts of Cadiz and the Exhibition of Fine Arts of Murcia. In 1900 he is chosen unanimously for the position of president of the Section of Class of the Circle of Fine Arts of Valencia. The same year takes part in the decoration of the ‘palacete de Don Jose Ayora’, in company of Ignacio Pinazo Camarlench, Antonio Fillol, Ricardo Verde and Luis Beüt. He makes the painting ‘Brindis’. A year later concurs to the National Exhibition of Beautiful Arts with the titled painting ‘My mother’. He contracts marriage with Inocencia Blanca Gimeno in 1901, widow and mother of three children: Amparo, Salvadora and Tomás. Two years later his first daughter is born, Julia. In 1909 the twins Mª Ana and Vicenta are born. The same year he is chosen librarian of the Modern School. In 1911 begins a sporadic graphical collaboration in the magazine ‘Letras y Figuras’. He entered to the new Circle of Fine Arts in 1912, after the overcoming in the organization of the split of a group of artists. He also took part in a tribute to Ignacio Pinazo Camarlench.

In 1916 his friend Jose Benlliure Ortiz dies. In 1919 his great friend Joaquín Agrasot dies, too. The pintura costumbrista style, that had rooted in the central years of the 19th century and principles of the 20th century, receives new shades with the influence of Vicente Blasco Ibáñez in the world of the art, with his novels he gives another perfection of the rural world, different like the vision of the static costumbrism. But Peris Brell impregnates of landscapes all the compositions with a subtle costumbrist shade, giving a special effect to the spectator. In 1923 he presents 31 works in the exhibition 'Manifestación de Arte Valenciano', celebrated in the palace of the Buen Retiro in Madrid, dedicating to him a room. The 10 August his friend and teacher Joaquín Sorolla dies. In 1924 he displays in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, his works ‘A plena luz’ and ‘Barraca valenciana’.

He founded the Community Service Organization (CSO) in 1948, which, with the support of the Industrial Areas Foundation, organized Mexican Americans in California. The CSO in San Jose, CA gave a young Cesar Chavez his first training in organizing, which he would later use in founding the United Farm Workers. Ross also trained the young Dolores Huerta in community organizing.Editors (2007) \\"Dolores Huerta Biography.\\" Dolores Huerta Foundation. Ross worked with Edward Roybal and other Mexican-Americans to form the CSO in East Los Angeles, and Roybal became its first President. This chapter of the CSO became politically active and help to elect Roybal to the City Council of Los Angeles in 1949, the first Mexican-American to serve as such since the 19th century.Library of Congress web site (2009) Background Fred Ross Sr. was born in San Francisco in 1910. He started out with a general secondary teaching credential from the University of Southern California in 1936. However, because of the Great Depression, he could not find employment. In 1937, Ross received a position with the state relief administration doing social work. After quitting his caseworker job, Ross worked for the Farm Security Administration, which was in charge of relief program in the Coachella Valley.Levy, Jacques E. Cesar Chavez: Autobiography of La Causa. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1975. Print.Bruns, Roger. Cesar Chavez: A biography. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2005. Print. Experience in organizing In John Steinbeck's famous novel The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck describes the journey and tribulations of the Joad family, a group of migrant workers looking for work in California. He describes a labor camp that was based on a real camp in Arvin. Fred Ross Sr. was placed in charge of this camp shortly after Steinbeck left the area. Ross was later promoted to cover about 25 camps similar to this one all over California and Arizona. In the camps, Ross saw the poverty and poor working conditions experienced by the workers. He found in his heart the desire to organize, and he did so by earning the trust of the workers and beginning a form of self-government in the camp so that the workers could band together to fight to improve their conditions. He encouraged them to speak up and be heard, despite the fear of confrontation with power holders. After the war, Ross worked for the American Council of Race Relations, whose goal was to \\"create unity, and end the riots…between whites and minorities.\\" Ross spearheaded Civic Unity Leagues in California's conservative Citrus Belt, bringing Mexican- and black Americans together to battle segregation. In Orange County, parents organized by Ross won a landmark lawsuit (Mendez v. Westminster School District) in 1947 that paved the way for the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education desegregation decision in 1954. Ross began organizing and obtained the interest of Saul Alinsky, a well known organizer and head of the Industrial Areas Foundation. In September 1947, Alinsky hired Ross to organize Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles. He organized in Southern California for 6 years before moving on to San Jose, which was the largest Spanish center outside of Los Angeles. Voter registration Ross worked on voter registration in Riverside County, in the town of Belltown, where there was a segregation problem in the public schools. The Mexican and African- American children were all attending one school and the Anglo children were picked up by a bus and taken to another school. There was a bond election to provide funding to fix the predominantly Anglo school, but there was to be no money spent on the other school. The mainly Hispanic area was the Casa Blanca barrio, but their city council representative was an orange grower that refused to visit the people and address their grievances because of previous worker strikes against him. Ross, alongside numerous NAACP workers, registered voters in this area and unified the Hispanic community to vote against the orange grower in the city council election. Belltown eventually integrated the schools and the bonds passed. After this experience, Ross began to believe in the success of his type of organization. From then on, Ross and the CSO established two broad-based programs wherever they went - voter registration and citizenship classes. House-meeting organizing It was during his organizing in Southern California that Ross developed the house-meeting technique that he would soon teach to Cesar Chavez; it would become the hallmark tactic of the UFW. Although many sources state Saul Alinsky trained Ross and Chavez, Ross claimed that it was not true. He said, \\"I'd been at it over a year before I met him.\\" The house-meeting technique involved about a three-week period in which Ross would hold small house meetings to build up to one large organizing meeting to set up temporary officers. Then there would be more house meetings for several more weeks to lead up to another larger meeting to set up a working CSO chapter. Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and Fred Ross Jr. Fred Ross Sr. trained a myriad of successful organizers during his lifetime. The most renowned of these organizers are Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and his son, Fred Ross Jr. Ross recruited Cesar while he was in San Jose; at first when Ross Sr. visited Chavez at his home, he was doubtful of his intentions. However, he soon saw that Ross was a man whose life calling was to help people in need. Chavez believed in Ross's technique and after their first house meeting, he accepted Ross's offer to join the CSO. That night, Ross wrote in his journal, \\"I think I found the guy I'm looking for.\\" Ross continued to be an advisor and confidant to Chavez for the remainder of his life even when Chavez split from the CSO and began his own union. Another young and intelligent organizer that Ross recruited was Dolores Huerta. She met him in Fresno in 1955. He showed her pictures of mobilized workers in Los Angeles and she knew she wanted to be a part of this organization. She began working with CSO in Stockton, helping run civic and educational programs. She soon met Chavez and so began their lifelong friendship and coalition to organize farmworkers. When Chavez decided to form his own union, the UFW, Huerta was shocked. However, \\"when the initial shock wore off, I thought it was exciting,\\" said Huerta. Huerta would be a main organizer and leader in the UFW until 2000. . Fred Ross also trained Ellie Cohen in the housemeeting method around nuclear weapons proliferation that she developed into a swing congressional district grassroots organizing approach. Fred Ross's son, Fred Ross Jr., followed in his footsteps by becoming a community organizer. He retained the tactics learned from his father and worked alongside both Chavez and Huerta. Ross Jr. played a large role in the Active Citizenship campaign, Gallo march, and other UFW events. Ross Jr.'s legacy remains in the national organization he began with the help of his father, Neighbor to Neighbor. Neighbor to Neighbor was founded in 1986 to recruit and train organizers to put political pressure on Congress to stop U.S. military aid to right wing forces in Central America. Neighbor to Neighbor employed similar techniques to the UFW, including a house meeting campaign targeting swing members of Congress developed by Ellie Cohen, a boycott of Salvadoran coffee, and provided a vital training ground for young activists to become the key organizers in the mid-to-late 1980s.Shaw, Randy.

Otto de Grandson (c. 1238–1328), sometimes numbered Otto I to distinguish him from later members of his family with the same name, was the most prominent of the Savoyard knights in the service of King Edward I of England, to whom he was the closest personal friend and many of whose interests he shared. Service in England and Wales (1265–90) The son of Pierre, lord of Grandson near Lausanne, the young Otto travelled to England probably in the company of Peter II of Savoy in 1252, certainly not later than 1265. There he entered the service of King Henry III and by 1267 was placed in the household of Prince Edward. In return for likely service for Prince Edward at the battles of Lewes and Evesham he was rewarded with property at Queenhithe in London. In 1268 both prince and servant were knighted and in 1271 the latter accompanied his lord on the Ninth Crusade, where he served at Acre that year. According to one source, it was Otto, not Eleanor of Castile, who sucked the poison from the wounded Edward after an attempted assassination. In 1272 Otto was appointed an executor in Acre. Returning to England, he was a key household knight of King Edward I in his campaigns in Scotland and Wales, where he served as chief justiciar of Wales, based at Caernarfon Castle from 1284 to 1294. During the Welsh Wars of King Edward I Otto was very active diplomatically and militarily, beginning with the siege of Dolforwyn Castle in April 1277. On behalf of Edward, he concluded the Treaty of Aberconwy in November that brought the invasion of Wales in 1277 to an end. In 1278, he was appointed King's Lieutenant in the Duchy by Edward and sent to the Duchy of Gascony along with Robert Burnel. to reform the government He was also employed as a diplomat and gained contacts with most of the sovereigns of western Europe. During the second invasion of Wales in 1282–83 he narrowly escaped death at the battle of Moel-y-don before in April 1283 taking the town of Harlech at the head of 560 infantry. As a commander of the royal army that had begun the campaign from Anglesey he was amongst the first of Edward’s retinue to see the future castle sites at Caernarfon and Harlech. In 1283 he was briefly in the employ of Edmund Crouchback, the king's younger brother, for diplomatic work. It was said that no one could do the king's will better, including the king himself. He was appointed governor of the Channel Islands and in 1290 appointed a bailiff for each of the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, giving them civil powers to administer the islands. Crusading years (1290–99) King Edward I of England sent Otto to Acre in the Holy Land in 1290 along with some English knights.Runciman, Steven. A History of the Crusades: Volume III The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades. Cambridge University Press. 1954, 345. At the time of the fall of Acre (1291), he was the master of the English knights in Palestine. At Acre he saved the life of fellow Savoyard Jean I de Grailly, with whom he had served Edward in Gascony earlier. As the city fell to the Muslims he commandeered Venetian ships filling them with fleeing troops and the wounded Jean I de Grailly, Otto was the last to join them on board.Runciman, Steven. A History of the Crusades: Volume III The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades. Cambridge University Press. 1954, 350. After the fall of the city he fled to Cyprus a poor man, but went on a subsequent pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In 1298 or 1299, Otto, Jacques de Molay of the Templars, and Guillaume de Villaret of the Hospitallers campaigned in Cilicia in order to fight off an invasion by the Mamluks.Demurger, 142–143.Newman, 231, says that De Molay had an \\"ill- fated expedition to Armenia around 1299, in which the last Templar holding in that kingdom was lost.\\" In his La flor des estoires d'Orient, the Armenian monk Hayton of Corycus mentions his activity on the mainland in Cilicia in 1298–1299: \\"Otto de Grandison and the Masters of the Temple and of the Hospitallers as well as their convents, who were at that time [1298 or 1299] in these regions [Cilician Armenia] . . .\\".Quoted in Demurger, 116 Back in England (1299–1307) He was summoned to Parliament in 1299, which resulted in him becoming Baron Grandison. This title became extinct on his death.Complete Peerage, 1st edition, Volume IV, P74 Ireland and the Continent (1307–28) In 1307, on Edward's death, Otto left England permanently. He remained in the service of the crown for a while longer, however, for until 1317 he represented England at the Papal Curia. He also continued to have interests in England, for he was in correspondence with John Langton and Walter Reynolds and in 1277 he had been granted the Channel Islands as a lordship for life, along with lands in England and Ireland, in reward for his service. In 1323 he visited the Channel Islands with a bodyguard of twenty crossbowmen, which he had been ruling (inefficiently) as an absentee. He also made religious foundations from his great wealth, probably accumulated as reward for his work, and for these he obtained privileges and priories from the popes through his embassies. He was a benefactor of Vale Royal, an Edwardian foundation, and of Saint Jean de Grandson, where he increased the number of monks after 1288. He founded a Franciscan friary in 1289 and a Carthusian monastery at La Lance in 1317. Tomb of Otto de Grandson in Lausanne Cathedral. At the end of his life he returned to Grandson, which he had inherited from his father and to which he had made recurrent visits throughout his adult life. He never married and was succeeded by his nephew. He had advanced many of his relatives through his embassies, especially in the church. Three of his relatives served as Bishops of Lausanne and another nephew, John Grandisson, succeeded to the Diocese of Exeter. In the spring of 1328, the ninety-year-old knight set out tor one last trip to Rome. Close to Aigle, he was taken ill. On 5 April 1328, he died.Dean, 120.Reymond, Maxime.

It was prepared by Friedrich Engels from notes left by Karl Marx and published in 1885.  Contents  Volume II is divided into three parts: # The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits # The Turnover of Capital # The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital In this book, the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found, namely how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae, not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in Volume I), but rather the money owner and money lender, the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or functioning capitalist. Moreover, workers appear in Volume II essentially as buyers of consumer goods and therefore as sellers of the commodity labour power, rather than producers of value and surplus-value, although this latter quality established in Volume I remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based. Marx wrote in a letter sent to Engels on 30 April 1868: \\"In Book 1 [...] we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process £100 becomes £110, the latter will find already in existence in the market the elements into which it will change once more. But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are found at hand, namely the social intertwining of the different capitals, of the component parts of capital and of revenue (= s)\\". This intertwining, conceived as a movement of commodities and of money, enabled Marx to work out at least the essential elements, if not the definitive form of a coherent theory of the trade cycle, based upon the inevitability of periodic disequilibrium between supply and demand under the capitalist mode of production (Ernest Mandel, Intro to Volume II of Capital, 1978). Part 3 is the point of departure for the topic of capital accumulation which was given its Marxist treatment later in detail by Rosa Luxemburg, among others.
