She wrote An Introduction to Plant Biochemistry.  Early life and education  Steele was the daughter of James Steele, the former headmaster of St Monance school in Fife. Steele's early education began at West Calder at the age of five. After moving to St Monans and by age 12, her secondary educational experience occurred at Waid Academy in Anstruther, Fife. In 1920, Steele entered the University of St Andrews graduating in 1924 with a First Class Honours in mathematics and natural philosophy. She continued to study at the University, and in 1925 received a BSc with Special Distinction in chemistry, physics and mathematics. She joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society soon after. She changed fields to study chemistry and earned her PhD in 1928. Steele was a Commonwealth Fellow, where she travelled to the United States to continue her research at University of Illinois for two years and then at Harvard University.  Professional life  Steele taught at the Ladies' Branch of the Horticultural College, Swanley, Kent (later the Swanley Horticultural College) in the 1930s where many middle-class women learned horticulture. She later returned to the USA. Her book An Introduction to Plant Biochemistry was first published in 1934, with a second edition released in 1949. The book aims to assist botany students with no training in organic chemistry for studies of plant biochemistry. Steele wrote the book following support from Professor John Read with whom she collaborated on books such as Researches in the Methane Series Part VI and Part VII and The Optically Active Diphenylhydroxyethylamines and isoHydrobenzoins.

The name of the windthrow educational trail is derived from Hurricane Lothar, which tore through the forest here on 26 December 1999 with wind velocities of up to 200 km/h creating a wide swathe of debris. After mountain pastures became increasingly uncultivated as a result of the housing of livestock and the abandonment of haymaking, the plateaux of the Northern Black Forest were initially reforested, predominantly with spruce, whose roots could not penetrate the bunter sandstone soil to any great depth. As a result, when the storm hit the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, around 30 million cubic metres of wood was torn from the ground within the space of two hours. After the storm, conservation and forest managers decided to leave the 10-hectare windthrow area of the Lothar Path to recover unaided as an area of protected forest or Bannwald, in order to be able to observe the long-term, natural regeneration of the habitat. The project was entrusted to the Black Forest National Park. In June 2003, as part of the EU-sponsored Grinde Black Forest project, an 800-metre-long educational and discovery path was constructed by the Black Forest High Road (B 500) between Ruhestein and Kniebis-Alexanderschanze. The path runs along steps, bridges and footbridges made from the dead wood, over and under the fallen trees. An observation platform offers views over Braunberg, Lierbach, Oppenau, Strasbourg and the Vosges; in clear weather, the Feldberg, the Kaiserstuhl and the Alps may be seen. In 2007 it was recorded that nearly 50,000 visitors came to the Lothar Path annually.Der ¬ªLotharpfad¬´ kommt in die Jahre, Mittelbadische Presse ‚Äì Zeitung der Ortenau, 19 March 2007, retrieved 24 August 2013Der Lotharpfad feiert 10j√§hriges Jubil√§um, landkreis-freudenstadt.de, 17 June 2013, retrieved 24 August 2013  Literature  * Regierungspr√§sidium Karlsruhe (publ.): Sturmwurf-Erlebnis auf dem Lotharpfad. 3rd edition.

The foundation became especially active after the global financial crisis of 2008. Between 2008 and 2013 it gave away some $1.6 billion. According to the New York Times, \\" Goldman is a firm that prides itself on discretion, but it isn‚Äôt giving away its billions quietly. It has bestowed the Goldman Sachs logo ‚Äî and hundreds of millions of dollars ‚Äî on two splashy programs, one that supports women in developing countries and another that helps small businesses.\\" Its initial president, and serving through January 2010, was Stephanie Bell-Rose, who had a background with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. She was succeeded as president in 2010 by Dina Habib Powell, who stayed in the position until January 2017 herself and who soon after her departure became a Deputy National Security Advisor (United States). Initiatives Some of the Foundation's initiatives involve supporting and developing entrepreneurs around the world, including 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses. 10,000 Women provides women entrepreneurs in developing countries with business education, access to capital and mentors. Under Powell, Goldman Sachs partnered with International Finance Corporation and Overseas Private Investment Corporation to raise 600 million dollars, to provide access to capital for more than 100,000 women worldwide. Goldman's 10,000 Small Businesses, which was co-chaired by Lloyd Blankfein, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, supports the growth and expansion of small business in the U.S. and UK. In 2000, Prep for Prep partnered with the Goldman Sachs Foundation to establish the New York Metro Region Leadership Academy. According to a report on the Goldman Sachs Foundation signature initiative to develop high-potential youth. The Foundation only supported two cohorts of students (131 accepted) and the program had to end due to a lack of funding. In September 2006, the Parliament of Bangladesh ratified the landmark Charter of the Asian University for Women. The Charter endowed the University with institutional autonomy, academic freedom, and embedded it in the principle of non-discrimination. In 2005 and 2006, the Goldman Sachs Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided the start-up funds which enabled the university to become operational in 2008.

It was built by Muthialu Nayakan (Muthyala Nayaka) (1540 - 1550 CE) and dedicated to Venkateshwara. 10\\\\. The Venkataramana Temple of Gingee was also called the 1000 pillar temple History The ruins of the Venkataramana temple is located in the outer lower fort inside the Gingee Fort complex. Parts of the temple were dismantled by different personages. In 1761 CE, when Gingee fell to French occupation, many tall graceful monolithic ornamental pillars were dismantled from this temple and taken to Pondicherry to be set around the base of the statue of Governor Dupleix. Later, in 1860 CE, a Jain official in the Madras Provincial Services, Sri Baliah, facilitated the dismantling of several stone-pieces including the great stone elephants from the Gingee Venkataramana temple, to make edifices in the Sittamur Jain temple. The successor of Muthialu Nayaka, named Venkatappa Nayaka, had permitted a Jain merchant to build the Sittamur shrine. Architecture The temple is a large, well-planned structure of mostly a single phase of construction. The temples's most admirable carvings are found in the panels located on either side of the entrance gateway depicting Ramayana scenes, Vishnu's incarnations and the puranic legend of samudra manthan. To its west lies the Anaikulam tank used for bathing elephants, further west to which are the famous tanks of Chakrakulam and the Chettikulam, fed by perennial springs which do not dry even in summer‚Äîa key feature of Senji being its water works with dams and canals constructed by Krishnappa Nayaka and his immediate successors. The Chettikulam was built either in the 17th century by Rama Chetti or in the 18th century by Rama Shetty under the Maratha Kingdom. The Chakrakulam was constructed by Muthyala Nayaka, who also constructed a mandapa beside the Venkataramana temple on a road leading to the VarahaNadi and a temple of Chakraperumal on its bank. Raja Design's cremation site is near the Chettikulam. Near the Chakrakulam is a big natural boulder with a hollow which served as the prisoner's well into which the condemned were thrown. To the east of the temple is the Kalyanamahal, an architectural treasure piece; which according to the MacKenzie manuscripts were built by one Krishnappa Nayaka, who was possibly Tubaki Krishnappa Nayaka. The attractive monument, built in the Vijayanagara style, is made up of a square court surrounded by rooms with verandahs on arches with stairways, in the middle of which is an 8-storey square tower with a pyramidal roof. The temple contains a number of inscriptions in Tamil which also refer to several structures built elsewhere in the Tamil country by other nayaks. Shrines of Goddesses are placed in the western corners of the temple, each with a small mandapa with a pier having multiple colonettes while another shrine with Narasimha and Krishna carvings is placed away from the middle of the western wall. Other structures The Venugopalaswami shrine is tucked away in one of the gateways of the inner fort, in a state of ruin and disrepair. Only a stone slab cut out on the side of a rock exists. It is a remarkable piece of sculpture in bold relief in which is carved a panel of Krishna, Rukmani and Satyabhama and two other female figures. The Jesuit traveller, Father Pimenta, who visited Gingee in 1599 AD mentions it in his accounts. The Pattabhirama shrine, (aka Pattabhiramaswami temple) situated at the foot of the Chakkali Durgam hill, also has several carvings of interest.

By it the British Parliament renounced all right to legislate for Ireland, and declared that no appeal from the decision of any court in Ireland could be heard in any court in Great Britain. Background The Declaratory Act 1719 declared that the king and parliament of Great Britain had \\"full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient validity to bind the Kingdom and people of Ireland\\", and that the Irish House of Lords had no power to hear appeals from Irish courts.The Law & Working of the Constitution: Documents 1660-1914, ed. W. C. Costin & J. Steven Watson. A&C; Black, 1952. Vol. I (1660-1783), p.128-9 This was greatly resented by the Irish parliament. In the early 1780s, the combination of political pressure from individuals such as Henry Grattan and Henry Flood and the conventions of the Irish Volunteers, at a time when Britain was involved in the American Revolutionary War, led to the passing of the Repeal Act of 1782, which granted legislative independence to the Kingdom of Ireland. A small number of Irish politicians believed that repeal of the act did not imply that the British parliament could not assume the right to legislate for Ireland. As W. E. H. Lecky put it, \\"the Declaratory Act had not made the right, and therefore its repeal could not destroy it.\\" Flood became convinced that it was necessary that the British parliament pass an act specifically renouncing any right to legislate for Ireland. Initially the majority of the Irish parliament, including Grattan, opposed such a move. Later that year, however, Lord Mansfield heard an appeal from an Irish court in the English King's Bench. This had the effect of strengthening Flood's hand, and the result was the passage, on 17 April 1783, of the Renunciation Act. Content The Act contained two sections. The first declared The second dealt specifically with the right of appeal: The statute did not state that appeals from Irish courts lay with the Irish House of Lords, but in practice the Irish House of Lords took on this function.Lyall (1993‚Äì1995), p. 325‚Äì6 End of operation The Act of Union 1800 abolished the Irish parliament, and thus ended legislative independence. That act did not repeal the Renunciation Act, and even the Statute Law Revision Act 1871 repealed only a few short sentences at the end of section 2 relating to records of proceedings before 1782. Indeed, the act was still on the statute books when the Short Titles Act was passed in 1896.

Born as Anand Rao to Vasudev Rao Newalkar, a cousin of Raja Gangadhar Rao, he was adopted by the maharaja after his own son died. The adoption of Anand Rao, who was renamed Damodar Rao, occurred on the day before the Maharaja died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was adopted, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this, Rani Laxmibai cried out \\"I shall not surrender my Jhansi\\" (mai apni Jhansi kabhi nahi doongi). In March 1854, Rani Laxmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort. Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books, pp. 113‚Äì14N.B. Rao only means \\"prince\\"; the maharaja was Gangadhar Newalkar of the Newalkar clan. However, actions by mutineers at Jhansi and the failure of negotiations between the Rani and the Company resulted in Jhansi State reasserting its independence. Eventually, Company forces laid siege to the city of Jhansi and after determined resistance, they breached its defences. Rani Laxmibai evaded capture by, according to tradition, with Damodar Rao on her back jumping on her horse, Badal from the fort. They survived but the horse died. More probably she escaped in the night with her son, surrounded by guards.Rani of Jhansi, Rebel against will by Rainer Jerosch, published by Aakar Books 2007; chapters 5 and 6 The point from where Rani Lakshmibai jumped with her horse, Badal and young Damodar Rao, according to legend, marked at Jhansi Fort. After the death of Rani Laxmibai at Kotah ki Serai on 18 June 1858, he survived that battle and lived with his mentors in the jungle, in dire poverty. According to a memoir purporting to be by Damodar Rao, he was among his mother's troops and household at the battle of Gwalior, together with others who had survived the battle (some 60 retainers with 60 camels and 22 horses), he fled from the camp of Rao Sahib of Bithur and as the village people of Bundelkhand dared not aid them for fear of reprisals from the British they were forced to live in the forest and suffer many privations.The whole memoir was published in Marathi in Kelkar, Y. N. (1959) Itihasachya Sahali (\\"Voyages in History\\"). He had taken asylum in Jhalrapatan when due to help of some old confidants, he met Raja Pratapsinh of Jhalarpatan. An old confidant, Nanekhan impressed upon the local British political officer, Flink to forgive young Damodar. He was sent to Indore, after he surrendered to the British. Here, Sir Richard Shakespeare, the local political agent, placed him under the guardianship of a Kashmiri teacher, called Munshi Dharmanarayan, to teach Damodar - Urdu, English & Marathi. He was allowed to keep only 7 followers (all others had to leave) and was allotted an annual pension of Rs. 10,000. He settled down at Indore and married. His first wife died shortly afterwards and he was married again into Shivre family. In 1904, he had a son named Lakshman Rao. Later, after end of the Company rule in India, he also petitioned British Raj for recognition but was refused to be recognized as legal heir. Damodar Rao was an avid photographer by passion.

He was one of Indiana's leading canners and was the founder of the Central State Canning Company and the Sturm Canning Company, of which he was president.  Early life  Sturm was born in Marion County, Indiana on January 5, 1865. His parents John (March 1, 1830 ‚Äì May 7, 1895) and Elizabeth (Greenwalt) (January 15, 1835 ‚Äì February 2, 1898) Sturm were German immigrants. Two of their children were born in Germany. Owing to conditions of life in Central Europe John Sturm sought better opportunities in the New World. In about 1862 the family arrived in Indianapolis. His first job in Indiana was in a brickyard. A few years later he became a farmer. He was also a teamster in Indianapolis. They were members of the Zion Evangelical Church. Sturm attended the common schools of Marion County and for a short time was a student in the Lutheran parochial school. As a small boy, he sold papers on the streets of Indianapolis and shined shoes. At age thirteen, he began regular employment as a farmhand. After his marriage, he rented a small farm south of the city and lived there for a year or two. From the farm he went to work as a drayman for Charles Roesener of the Central Transfer Company. Sturm's introduction to the canning business came when he went to work for the Van Camp Packing Company. He was given many responsibilities in their plant, having charge of packing and shipping. With this experience and with his modest capital in 1914 he organized the Central State Canning Company, and became its president.  Central State Canning Company  In 1914 Sturm founded the Central State Canning Company was founded in Indianapolis.

For two months, the Taliban had launched fresh attacks in trying to recapture the town. Early fights In January, Taliban fighters launched a strong attack against government positions in Sangin, killing more than 100 soldiers and police officers, but they were driven back with help from extra troops and airstrikes. Officials said the fighters used tunnels from private houses to reach front-line government checkpoints. Also on 31 January, 19 Taliban fighters were killed and 25 others wounded. Two Afghan service members were killed and as many wounded during the clashes. On 2 February, at least 32 Taliban insurgents were killed, including three commanders and 40 wounded during an attack on a military base in Sangin district during the past four days, provincial governor's office said in a statement. On 11 February, Helmand governor Hayatullah Hayat said at least 60 Taliban insurgents were killed at night in security operations backed foreign air forces, which caused civilians casualties. Later, the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said that US airstrikes in Sangin occurred on 9 and 10 February and initial inquiries suggest that the airstrikes killed at least 18 civilians, nearly all women and children. Fall of the town The area around Sangin had been a hotspot of Taliban activity for several years, and the district itself had seen more British and American marines killed than any other district in Afghanistan. After enduring repeated insurgent attacks, the government forces tasked with defending the town reportedly withdrew overnight, enabling the Taliban to take control early in the morning of 23 March. Aftermath Since the town lies on a key road into Lashkar Gar, the loss of Sangin has been interpreted as a major setback for the Afghan government, potentially paving the way for further Taliban advances in Helmand and Kandahar provinces. Colonel Richard Kemp, who previously commanded British forces in Afghanistan, said that British and American troops \\"should have remained in Afghanistan in much greater numbers to see them through the very dangerous transition period for longer\\". Immediately after the withdrawal in March, Sangin police chief Mohammad Rasoul had stated that security forces were preparing \\"reinforcements to recapture the district\\", although no significant reported action has taken place. In April 2017, a deployment of 300 US Marines began arriving in the region, at Camp Shorabak (formerly Camp Bastion), in a non-combative support role for the ANA 215th Corps, including \\"following them onto the battlefield\\".

Written by the band (Will Gould, Ian Miles, Hannah Greenwood, Sean Scott, Dan Bratton and Oliver Burdett) with producer Neil Kennedy, it was featured on the band's 2017 debut studio album Eternity, in Your Arms. The track was released as the second single and music video from the album on 12 December 2016. Composition and lyrics \\"Hiding with Boys\\" was described by Creeper's record label Roadrunner Records in a press release as a song which captures the band's \\"unique cocktail of rollicking punk rock and dark gothic romanticism\\" and \\"marries [the band's frontman] Will Gould's impassioned croon with sweet harmonies from keyboardist Hannah Greenwood\\". Speaking at the time of the song's release, Gould proposed that \\"It's a bridge of sorts from the band we were on the EPs to the band that we are now, and creating it helped us to find a way to bring our incredibly varied influences together\\". The vocalist described it as \\"a song of unrequited love told from the perspective of a 'tragic monster'\\" and described it as \\"a lyrical sequel of sorts\\" to The Stranger single \\"Black Mass\\".

Ticketmaster's Ben Tipple called it a \\"morose melody driven track\\", while Kerrang! Radio presented it as \\"a towering rock anthem worthy of vast arenas\\". Clash writer Dannii Leivers categorised the song as \\"nu-emo\\", while Anita Bhagwandas of the NME compared its style to that of The Cure. Gould has claimed that the chorus was intended to sound like a \\"downtown musical\\", and that the song is \\"one of the most fun\\" to perform live. Promotion and release On 11 December 2016, \\"Hiding with Boys\\" received its worldwide premiere on the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show with Daniel P. Carter. The song was released as a digital download the following day, alongside a music video for the track. The video was filmed in Southampton and directed by Jamie Carter, who also worked on \\"Suzanne\\" and later \\"Black Rain\\". Summarising the content of the music video, Cat Velez of Promo News explained that \\"Our troubled protagonist is a middle-aged man, haunted by demons visible to him for mere seconds before dissapearing [sic] out of sight ‚Äì but not out of mind\\". The protagonist in question is paranormal investigator James Scythe, the fictional subject of the lyrical concept of Eternity, in Your Arms, who is \\"stalked\\" by the titular subject of the band's 2016 EP The Stranger. \\"Hiding with Boys\\" serves as the first in a trilogy of narratively-linked videos for the album, which continued on \\"Black Rain\\". Critical reception Media response to \\"Hiding with Boys\\" was positive. Stephen Ackroyd of Upset magazine described it as \\"another 10/10 amazing track\\" following previous single \\"Suzanne\\", praising it as \\"an arms aloft anthem that proves exactly why Creeper are the most exciting rock band in, y'know, like, forever\\". Kerrang! Radio claimed that the song \\"proves why Creeper are one of the most hotly tipped acts around\\". In her review of Eternity, in Your Arms, Clash writer Dannii Leivers praised the song's \\"fantastic chorus\\".

It is the first book in the Treasure Hunters series. It was published in 2013. The book chronicles the life of the Kidd sidings, who find themselves in the biggest treasure hunt of their lives after their parents disappear. The story shows them working together to defeat pirates and lose the pursuit of treasure-hunting rivals while following clues to find out what really happened to their parents and if they are still alive. Plot summary The Kidd siblings: Storm, (Stephanie) Tommy, (Thomas) Bick, (Bickford) and Beck, (Rebecca) used to live a happy life on their ship until their father Thomas Kidd goes missing during a storm. Their mother also went missing three months earlier in Cyprus. The Kidds hold a small funeral for their father who is presumed to be dead. They continue to treasure hunt, their family business. The Kidds start their treasure hunt in the Cayman Islands, which was their treasure hunt destination before the storm. The four of them go into the secret compartment in their ship, The Lost, known as the Room, where they find a list of the top ten greatest treasures of the world. A speedboat follows the Kidds. They are taken to Louie Louie, referred to as the Big Man, a person who previously had done many deals with their father. He says that he needs an item their father promised to give him in exchange for a bee amulet and repairing The Lost for the Kidds. Tommy takes a girl named Daphne for a tour of the ship. Bick and Beck search her and find out that she was trying to steal a mwana pwo African mask. Louie Louie takes the mwana pwo mask, the item he desired and gives the Kidds the bee amulet. They find a map in the bee amulet titled Cordoba's Lost Fleet, which was a vessel that carried gold and silver bars that went missing after a hurricane. The map is later revealed to be a fake kept by the treasure hunter Nathan Collier, who was the number one nemesis of their parents. He informs the Police about their whereabouts who are about to take them to the orphanage but Storm's knowledge of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea saves them. We also learn later in the book that Solomon's knowledge helps them find where there dad is. Tommy reveals that their father had discovered two of Cordoba's lost fleet shortly after Bick and Beck's birth and was instructed to reveal the treasure only when the Kidds were in a financial crisis. They take most of the treasure from the fleet, leaving some behind. Using Louie Louie's contacts they are able to sell the treasure to his associate in Miami. Timothy, their father's overseer, arrives at their ship and announces that he is living with them. Soon afterward, The Lost is followed by speedboats with pirates. They ask the Kidds for the key to the Room but they lie they don't have a key. The pirates then kidnap Beck as a backup. They use a lie-detecting device on her but she manages to outsmart the pirates and steals a bottle of Pentothal from them. They give her back to Timothy. The Kidds, who have grown suspicious of Timothy, use the Pentothal on him after he goes to sleep. He reveals that he is a CIA agent and their parents were also spy agents who worked under him. The Kidds trust him and allow him to go to do his duty. Soon afterward, the pirates, who had used a long-range hearing device to spy on their conversations, come back. They are however tricked into jumping off the ship. Nathan Collier arrives suddenly by tracking Tommy's satellite phone. He takes the key from the Kidds and checks the room but doesn't find anything. The Kidds then travel to Portia Macy Hudson, an antique collector and trades the Bee amulet for a Grecian Urn. Daphne arrives at the spot and reveals herself as Portia's daughter, who tried to take the mwana pwo mask directly to Louie to trade for the bee amulet. The Kidds track Dr. Lewis who is actually Louie's brother. He says that the Grecian Urn is the one mentioned by the English poet John Keats in the poem,\\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\". Dr. Lewis reveals the real story behind their mother's kidnapping. Aramis, commonly known as the pirate king, sends their mother to verify whether the Grecian urn with the pirates was an original. It was a fake and the pirates, furious for their deal being broken, kidnaps their mother for saying the truth. The Kidds try to take the Urn to the pirates to free their mother but it is stolen from the Kidds by a group of girls working for Nathan Collier. The Kidds, having no choice, go to Aramis as they have the provenance papers for proving the urn as an original. The Kidds, once close to the urn, take it and run. Suddenly, CIA agents under Uncle Timothy's leadership arrive and arrests Aramis. However, he only can save their mother from being killed by the pirates by making a deal with them. He makes the call to not kill their mother and is set free but his possessions are taken. Later on, the Kidds receive an email from their father and enjoy. Later on, the narrator, Bick, reveals it was him who sent the e-mail to make the family happy by making them think their father is alive and tells the readers not to tell anyone. Reception The book was a bestseller, with most sales happening between September 30 and October 6 2013. Both Kirkus Reviews and Booklist gave Treasure Hunters starred reviews with Kirk us Reviews writing, \\"This new series promises it all: ruthless pirates, CIA spies, terrorists, stolen works of art and priceless treasure. More important, it delivers a high-seas adventure that will entice even the most confirmed of landlubbers.\\" and Booklist writing, \\"From kidnapping to underwater speargun fights, action is the name of the game here, bolstered by bits of comedy. Although the premise and plot are wholly unconvincing, the fast-paced, first- person narrative is entertaining. With 10 treasures (not to mention two parents) waiting to be discovered, it looks like a new series is on the horizon.\\" The New York Times gave it mixed reviews, writing, \\"There isn't a lot of emotional heft, jazzy writing or deep characterization here, and the broad humour often falls flat.\\" The series was also reviewed by Common Sense Media and Publishers Weekly.

Fighting the Long Knives Mow-way was a Kotsoteka warrior and war leader who signed the Fort Cobb treaty in 1861 (along with the Yamparika head chief Ten Bears, the Nokoni head chief Quenah-evah, called \\"Eagle Drink\\" by the white people, and second-ranking chief Horseback, and the Penateka chiefs Tosahwi and Asa- havey), when several Comanche leaders met General Albert Pike (C.S.A.), and they signed an allegiance with the Confederation; later he signed the Medicine Lodge Treaty in October 1867. On November 27, 1868, General Philip H. Sheridan's winter campaign lead the Washita Massacre. Lt. Col. George A. Custer's 7th Cavalry attacked and destroyed Motavato (\\"Black Kettle\\") a Southern Cheyenne pacific encampment on the Washita River in Oklahoma. The Kotsoteka and Piaru-ekaruhkapu's Nokoni band immediately intervened to help the Cheyenne. They fought and wiped out Major Joel Elliott's 7th U.S. Cavalry troop of 20 men. Andrew W. Evans' Canadian River campaigns between November - December 1868 against Kwahadi, Kotsoteka and Nokoni Comanche villages, forced Piaru-ekaruhkapu (\\"Big Red Meat\\") and Tahka (\\"Arrowpoint\\")'s Nokoni, Mow-way's Kotsoteka, Parra-ocoom (\\"Bull Bear\\")'s Kwahadi to surrender. In January 1869, Mow-way surrendered to Colonel Benjamin Grierson. Grierson turned Mow-way over to Lawrie Tatum, the new Quaker agent at Fort Sill. Mow-way and the Kotsoteka soon left Fort Sill to rejoin their Kwahadi allies on the Staked Plains. After May 1871, Mow-way and his band were associated with the hostile Kwahadi band, perhaps due to his associations among the Nokoni with old Kiyou, as well as Peta-nocona (\\"Lone Wanderer\\"), Parra-ocoom (\\"Bull Bear\\"), Kobay-o-burra (\\"Wild Horse\\"), Kobay-o-toho (\\"Black Horse\\") and Peta-nocona's son, Quanah Parker.  Red River Attack  Mackenzie's troops attacked Mow-way's village near the North Fork of the Red River on September 28, 1872. Near McClellan Creek, in Gray County, Texas, the 4th U.S. Cavalry under Colonel Ranald Mackenzie, attacked Mow-way's village, the Kotsoteka, while under subchief Kai-Wotche's leadership. The \\"battle\\" was really an unexpected storm on the village with the easy killing of 23 men, women, and children and the capture of between 120 -130 (124) women and children and more than 1.000 horses. The Army had managed to catch the camp by surprise, and most of the village's inhabitants were captured. The Kwahadi warriors led by Parra-ocoom (\\"Bull Bear\\"), Kobay-oburra (\\"Wild Horse\\") and Quanah induced the soldiers to quickly retreat. On the day after the attack, on September 29, 1872, the Kotsoteka and Kwahadi warriors attacked the military encampment and retrieved the horses but not the women and children. The Comanche prisoners, the 120-130 women and children, were kept under guard and were transferred to Fort Concho, where they were kept prisoner through the winter. Mackenzie used the captives as a bargaining tool to force the off-reservation Indians back to the reservation and to force the Indians to free white captives. After the Red River battle. Mow-way and Parra- ocoom moved their bands to the vicinity of the Wichita Agency. The Nokoni peaceful chief, T âh âyakwahip â aka Kiyou (\\"Horseback\\"), who himself had family members among the Indian prisoners, persuaded the Comanches to trade stolen livestock and white captives in exchange for the captured women and children. Mow-way placed his camp near the agency and remained there until the release of the captives.  Adobe Walls Attack against Buffalo Hunters or the \\"Long Knives\\"  Together with Quanah (\\"Smell\\", son to Peta-nocona), Kobay-oburra (\\"Wild Horse\\") as Kwahadi war chiefs (being dying of pneumonia the paramount chief Parra-ocoom \\"Bull Bear\\"), Isa-rosa (\\"White Wolf\\"), Tabananika (\\"Sunrise's Voice\\"), Tuwikaa-tiesuat and Isananica (both of them sons to Parra-wa-samen \\"Ten Bears\\", by now set aside) as Yamparika leaders, Piaru- ekaruhkapu (\\"Big Red-meat\\") as the Nokoni militant chief, also Mow-way and his Kotsoteka band took part in the attack against the buffalo hunters at Adobe Walls on June 27, 1874 The Indians were overpowered due to the technical advantages of high power rifles and skilled marksmen who were used to hunting buffalo. After the attack, Mow-way hid in the Palo Duro Canyon, with their Kwahadi and Nokoni kinsmen and their Kiowa and Southern Cheyenne allies. Mackenzie's scouts discovered the hostile Comanche, Kiowa and Southern Cheyenne encampments in Palo Duro Canyon and attacked them on September 27, 1874. The Red River War ensued, It ended in 1875 with the surrender of Mow-way and his fellow warriors at Fort Sill on April 28, 1875.  Death of Mow-way  Mow-way died of pneumonia in 1886.

The process of conservation and restoration of paintings on canvas is different from that of panel paintings. In the United States, it is recommended that conservation practices follow the \\"Code of Ethics\\" set by the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works.  Preventive care  Preventive care is a form of conserving panel paintings. Improper storage conditions, environmental conditions, and handling can act as catalysts in damaging effects. These include chemical and structural damage, seen through skin oils and degradation that can be caused by high humidity or high temperature levels. The conservation of panel paintings can be achieved by a series of methods, including: = Handling = The recommended handling method of panel paintings is similar to that of canvas paintings and other two-dimensional works. The procedure includes planning the move, handling with two hands or in tandem, communication within the handling staff during the move, the use of nitrile gloves, the use of painting carts and other tools including a pallet jack or furniture dolly when moving a panel painting within a crat. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Canadian Conservation Institute, and the Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material provide general handbooks that discuss the proper handling and care of paintings. Storage room, Heritage Conservation Centre, Singapore = Storage = Typical storage units in museums include sliding screens or slotted shelves made out of MDF and heat treated wood coated in polyurethane. \\"S\\" Hooks are used to hang objects with the proper hanging hardware (e.g. D-Rings or eye brackets with picture wire) onto the screen. Temporary storage solutions include the use of ethafoam, moving/packing blankets, and archival corrugated cardboard. = Environmental conditions = Fluctuating humidity and temperatures can lead to smaller problems within the structure and painted surface that in the long- term accumulate. In panels that are made up of multiple pieces of wood composing the larger surface area, the damage can be visible where the pieces of wood are attached. Temperatures should range between +/- 5% of 70¬∞F and the humidity between +/- 5% of 50% Relative Humidity. A Relative Humidity over 65% can lead to mold growth and dry rot. In exhibitions panel paintings are subjected to various environmental conditions. The exhibition conditions must also be regulated to conserve the painting. These factor includes temperature, humidity , light intensity and duration of exposure, and air and atmospheric pollutants. There must be sufficient air filters attached to the HVAC system to reduce the air pollutants within the air in gallery/exhibition spaces along with storage areas (via reducing gases potentially emitted by various objects). Light levels must be at approximately 50-200 Lux as there is an irreversible light lifetime per panel painting. = Integrated pest management = CSIRO ScienceImage 1140 Damage Done by a Furniture Beetle Integrated Pest Management policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Concepts discussed in Integrated Pest Management Policies include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition, storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas.  Examples of causes of damage  Computer rendered illustration of different types of wood warping Damage can also come from: * Improper Relative Humidity ** Low Humidity reduces the chemical changes but raises the risks of mechanical damage to the paint by making it more brittle. ** High Humidity reduces mechanical damage but raises the risks of biological organisms, e.g. white efflorescence and green-to-black stains. ** High Humidity also raises the risks of curving of the wood over time, forcing the paint to flake off. * Flooding will cause swelling as seen in a case study by the Getty Conservation Institute. * Improper Temperature Examination  =Structural= CSIRO ScienceImage 1831 Borer damaged wood Proper examination of the object is an initial step in the conservation process. Commonly used technologies include radiography and reflectography. Radiography provides the effective technique in terms of analyzing the condition and preservation work done on the structure of panel paintings. Other uses of radiography can be seen by the opaqueness of specific colors used in the painting, condition of the wood, thickness or density of the wood, and various damage done by pests. Furniture and Larder Beetles can burrow into wood. Illustrations of these beetles can be found on the Insects Limited Incorporated website, and other examples can be found through Museumpests.net's page. website. = Surface and painting = Photographic documentation and the use of magnification with the naked eye used with diffuse and raking light are common methods used at art museums like the Tate Museum in the United Kingdom, these are effective tools for initial observation. Causes for damage in the surface of panel paintings can be caused by the structural issues in the wood, these include damage done by wood-boring pests. Damage to the painting can also be caused by the fluctuation of temperatures and relative humidity levels.

This technique has been employed in the Ophelia painting at the Tate museum. * Multispectral imaging * X-Ray radiography * Ultraviolet light - This technique has been employed in the Ophelia painting at the Tate museum. * Infra-red reflectography - This technique has been employed in the Tate Museum Treatments =Structural= Pests can cause damage to the wood panels used in panel paintings. The pests must be eradicated prior to conservation to ensure the longevity of the object and the conservation work. Examples of treatments include: * Isolation through bagging - putting the object in isolation with blotter paper, paper board, tissue or foam sealed in a polyethylene bag and monitored over several weeks or months. * Low Temperature - typically putting the object into a freeze (qualified for this type of use). The freezer must reach -20¬∞F (-29¬∞C) and objects must be put into the freezer inside a resealable plastic bag to be froze during 4 hours. Cradled panel painting, Aert van der Neer Conservators must adapt to the specific case of each panel and must use their experience to their advantage. Structures used in conservation include: * Custom strainers that are curved to match the panel with springs to safely flex. * Cradling - Cradling refers to the addition of support on the rear part of the panels. These must have flexibility to allow for some movement from slight temperature and humidity changes. * Adhesives - If there is a simple crack within the panel, adhesives are used in combination of alignment, and moderate compression. All adhesives used must adhere to the \\"Code of Ethics\\" and must be reversible. Treatment of adhesives include: * Reactivation of hide glues. * Adding water-based emulsion glues to existing and failing adhesives. * Replacing failed adhesives with new ones. Examples of adhesives include: * Natural protein adhesives - found through animal products such as casein, albumin, fish glue, and animal-hide glue. * Natural resins - often seen in historic objects. * Synthetic resin adhesives - \\"aqueous emulsions of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and are commonly called ‚Äúwhite‚Äù glues\\" Transfer of Panel Paintings - The transferral of a painting from an often unstable panel to another panel is considered to be a delicate process. This process occurs when there has been a form of degradation in the original panel (possible causes include pest damage (burrowing), warping, or the thinning of the panel). The transfer should be made to a similarly aged panel, made out of the same wood type. The National Gallery in the United Kingdom provides an example with Raphael's Virgin and Child. When a panel is submerged due to flooding, the recommended procedure is to expose the panel painting through a long drying process prior to any further conservation work. = Surface and painting = The Scientists by Rita Greer, 2007 The conservation of paintings varies for the different types of oil, acrylic and fresco paintings. These techniques include cleaning, removal and replacement of degraded varnish and the restoration of paint losses. The Tate Museum described that \\"Cleaning is a particularly delicate and demanding part of conserving and restoring paintings. Layers of dirt, discoloured varnish and old restorations that may be disfiguring or obscuring parts of the composition are painstakingly removed.\\" The evolution of modern paints, that can be used in panel paintings, has contributed to facilitate conservation. \\"The introduction of synthetic binders‚Äîmost notably acrylic, alkyd, polyvinyl acetate, and nitrocellulose‚Äîhas resulted in paints that exhibit fast drying times, reduced yellowing tendencies, a vast range of appearances and handling properties and, in the case of emulsion formulations, great flexibility and the elimination of organic solvents as thinners and diluents.  Outreach  The Penn Museum, based out of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), created the Artifact Lab where visitors interact with content related to the museum. The webpage provides a blog and other relevant pages relating to their Artifact Lab and its operations. It has a blog section discussing topics from general cleaning (with objects under different lights), to the use of various scanning technologies (such as X-radiography).

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History In 1888, mineral waters were discovered in Petoskey. Two years later, Frank S. Kedzie of Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University) declared that Petoskey's waters were the best in the state for bathing and drinking. Capitalizing on the appeal of the waters, a bathhouse and pavilion were constructed on this site, under a lease from the city of Petoskey. There is no visible trace of these 19th century structures at the site, but foundations may remain underground. The lease ended in 1908, and in 1914-16 the city redeveloped the park with a series of improvements, many donated by the Federation of Women's Clubs of Petoskey and other private individuals. These improvements included a fish pond, concrete paths, and benches. Also included was the 1915 park pavilion designed by local architect C. H. Hansen. The fish pond has been filled in, but the majority of the other improvements made in 1914-16 remain in the park. Description Mineral Well Park is a two-acre section located on the east side of the Bear River, and running from the West Mitchell Street Bridge north to West Lake Street. The park is a level section of grassland with a few large trees and shrubs. It contains cement pathways leading to the park pavilion. Grouped around the pavilion are the low, capped, cylindrical, fieldstone wells from which the park takes its name, and a retaining wall surrounding the former fish pond, which contains a bronze fountain in its center. The fish pond has been filled in and now contains plantings. The pavilion, designed by C. H. Hansen, is a single-story, open air, cross-gable-roof structure. Concrete urn balustrades encircle the pavilion, and link podia topped with short Tuscan columns. The columns support the entablature and roof.

It has glaucus, leathery, entire, 1‚Äì6 cm long leaves set oppositely along the stem, with umbels of initially long up-curved pale greenish-yellow buds, that open explosively, the petals usually bright yellow, strongly curling, long stamens and style clear red, orange or pink, and quickly falling after fertilisation. The initially green oval berries color red when ripe. The species is assigned to the showy mistletoe family. In the Afar language it is called hatote, while the vernacular name in the Oromo language is dertu dedacha.  Description  Plicosepalus sagittifolius is a small hemiparasitic shrub of around 1 m in diameter, that grows on the branches of different Acacia-species, sometimes on Albizia and Commiphora. It has eighteen chromosomes (2n=18). The species is closely related to P. curviflorus. = Stems and leaves = Branches are greyish brown and carry opposite pairs of light greenish grey leaves, with mostly three (sometimes up to seven) obvious or obscure veins each, that come in two different types. Seated leaves, about 4‚Äì5 cm long and ‚Öî-1 cm wide, lanceolate to oval in shape, with an arrow- or heart-shaped foot 6‚Äì8 mm long, clasping the branch they sit on, occur on the long shoots, and are spaced about 3‚Äì4 cm from the neighboring pairs. Shorter leaves on very short (1‚Äì3 mm long) stalks are arranged on the short shoots, that may also carry the inflorescences. cited on cited on = Flowers = P. sagittifolium parasitising on Acacia drepanolobium, being pollinated by a female scarlet-chested sunbird (Chalcomitra senegalensis)One or a few umbels of three to seven (sometimes up to twelve) flowers each on a dull purple common stalk of ¬Ω‚Äì1‚Öî cm long are set at the tip of the short shoots, which are leafy at their base. The dull purple stalks of the individual flowers are ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm long. The fully developed flowerbuds are 4¬Ω‚Äì5 cm long, have a thickened, campanulate, green receptacle of 2¬Ω‚Äì4 mm long, on top of which is an inconspicuous green ring-shaped calyx of ¬Ω‚Äì1 mm high. The corona is a greenish yellow, in the lower 6‚Äì8 mm widened and slightly S-shaped, further to the tip an up-curved tube of 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm long, and again wider at the tip. The corona opens suddenly into fully free petals that are strongly curled at the receptacle, initially bright yellow and sometimes reddish at the foot, remaining yellow or aging to orange-red. When open, the orange, pink or red filaments topped by 7‚Äì9 mm long anthers become visible. Style and stigma are equally bright red as the stamens. = Fruits = The receptacles develop into smooth oval berries of approximately 1 cm long and ‚Öî cm in diameter, initially green but becoming red when ripe.  Taxonomy  Adolf Engler described Loranthus undulatus var. sagittifolius in 1895. Thomas Archibald Sprague regarded this plant sufficiently different from Loranthus undulatus (now renamed Plicosepalus undulatus) to raise its rank to species, and so created Loranthus sagittifolius. Benedictus Hubertus Danser, who revised the subfamily Loranthoideae in 1933, reassigned the species to the genus Plicosepalus, making the new combination P. sagittifolius. = Etymology = The simple translation of the root words in Plicosepalus (from the Latin plicatus, meaning \\"folded\\") is \\"plied sepal\\". The species epithet sagittifolius is also derived from Latin words, meaning \\"arrow\\", and meaning \\"leaf\\", presumably because some of its leaves are arrow-shaped.  Distribution  Plicosepalus sagittifolius occurs in a wide zone in the east of tropical Africa, from South Africa (eastern Transvaal), Zambia, Malawi, coastal regions from southern Somalia via Kenya and Tanzania to northern Mozambique, and inland to the Rift Valley region from southern Ethiopia via Kenya and Uganda to southern Tanzania.  Habitat  Plicosepalus sagittifolius grows at altitudes of 30-2300 m.  Ecology  In Ethiopia, Plicosepalus sagittifolius can be found in coastal and deciduous bushland, Acacia and Acacia-Commiphora bushland and woodland. The most common hosts are Acacia mellifera and other Acacia-species, but it sometimes also parasitises on Albizia or Commiphora. The caterpillars of Iolaus jacksoni, Jackson's sapphire, feed on Plicosepalus-species, including P. sagittifolius.  Use  In Tanzania, Plicosepalus sagittifolius has been used in traditional medicine to treat cancer. The plant is used to soften leather, while branches are utilised as firewood.

Lu≈ænica () is a region in southeastern Serbia, comprising the Lu≈ænica river basin. It includes parts of the Babu≈°nica municipality and two villages in Bela Palanka (Pirot District). Geography Surrounding area of Babu≈°nica (in Serbian). The region occupies the hollow of the Lu≈ænica river, a tributary to the Vlasina, and the surrounding areas. The relief is mountainous, with dissecting valleys of a larger number of smaller streams. The process of erosion is developed at several places. The basin has an altitude 470‚Äì520 m. The area is surrounded by the Suva Mountain to the west, Ruy Mountain to the south, and Vla≈°ka Mountain to the northeast. The average air temperature is . Settlements Although the region is not administratively marked, it is divided into two parts, Upper Lu≈ænica (Gornja Lu≈ænica) and Lower Lu≈ænica (Donja Lu≈ænica). Villages located in the region include Babu≈°nica, Bogdanovac, Brati≈°evac, Brestov Dol, Vojnici, Gornje Krnjino, Gornji Stri≈æevac, Gorƒçinci, Grnƒçar, Dol, Donje Krnjino, Donji Stri≈æevac, Duƒçevac, Draginac, Izvor, Kaluƒëerevo, Kambelevci, Kijevac, Linovo, Ljuberaƒëa, Modra Stena, Provaljenik, Rado≈°evac, Resnik, Stol, Suraƒçevo (in Babu≈°nica), Be≈æi≈°te and ≈†ljivovik (in Bela Palanka). The 2011 census recorded the largest population decline in the country in this region. Economy The main economic activity in the region is based around agriculture. This micro- region, however, is one of the more underdeveloped areas of Serbia. Economic centers include Babu≈°nica and Ljuberaƒëa. Harsh living conditions and the economy in recent years has led to emigration to other parts of the country. History In 1841, a priest and his son were killed, by Albanians, after the Ni≈° rebellion (1841). During the Serbo-Bulgarian War, Serbian troops crossed the region. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1929‚Äì41), Lu≈ænica was a district in the Morava Banovina. The region was a site of military operations during World War II. Within the Serbian puppet state (1941‚Äì44), Lu≈ænica was a district within Ni≈° County. Culture =Dialect= The Prizren-Timok dialect is spoken in Lu≈ænica. The Lu≈ænica sub-dialect has some peculiarities, such as ƒçiniti instead of bojiti (an East Slavic innovation). The sub-dialect is considered one of the oldest, maybe even the oldest surviving, in Serbian language (\\"cultural window into the ancient time\\"). It is almost unintelligible for the Serbian speakers who are not from Lu≈ænica region. With other regional dialects, it has been surveyed by Aleksandar Beliƒá, who published Dialects of Eastern and Southern Serbia in 1905 which marked the beginning of the scientific dialectology in Serbia. A Dictionary of Lu≈ænica Speech, containing 40,000 words, was published in 2019 by Ljubisav ƒÜiriƒá. Many of the words belong to the various, locally specific and important lexical groups (speech of the shepherds, speech of the millers, etc.). The recordings of the people speeches which were gathered in 10 years during the compiling of the dictionary are kept in the phonetic library of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology. The dialect kept the archaic forms, from the period when the Old Church Slavonic was transforming into the modern Serbian language. Most of the sound changes today characteristic for the Serbian language, at this time still didn't occur (like palatalization or iotation). Some sounds have no corresponding letters in modern Serbian alphabet, which was fully adapted to the modern language by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá in the 19th century. Some of the characteristics which widely differ from the modern language include vocal L (standard allows only proper vocals A, E, I, O and U, and sometimes R), sound DZ and frequent use of semivowels, which in the rest of the language were replaced by the sound A during the process of semivowel's vocalization since the 14th century. Standard Serbian language has 7 grammatical cases, while Lu≈ænica dialect has only 3: first - nominative, fourth - accusative, fifth - vocative. For other cases, the adverbs are used instead. With the rapid decline in population, and schooling where people are taught the official standard of the language, the dialect is disappearing, too. By the late 2010s, only the oldest residents in the region still spoke it. =Traditions= At weddings in Lu≈ænica and Ni≈°ava, when the wedding guests (svatovi) go to fetch the bride, the ƒçau≈° (master of ceremony, an entertainer) \\"begins to shout and brandish his sabre\\". It was noted in 1958 that in Lu≈ænica and Ni≈°ava, the day after the saint feast days of St. Demetrius, Michael the Archangel and St. Nicholas are holidays, where cattle are left to rest and work is suspended, as the cattle are feared to become sick (called ≈æabica). =Music= The traditional music in the region is the gusle and epic poetry. In 1910 it was noted that the use of the gusle had decreased, compared to thirty years prior when \\"it was the favourite of the people\\". =Dress= At the beginning of the 20th century, the women wore white headscarfs or silk scarves, while older women wore adorned red baize. =Cuisine= A local specialty is the Lu≈ænica vurda, a creamy cheese with paprika. =Monuments= The local church was built in 1873, and the oldest surviving log houses date to the same period.

Resonance ionization is a process in optical physics used to excite a specific atom (or molecule) beyond its ionization potential to form an ion using a beam of photons irradiated from a pulsed laser light. In resonance ionization, the absorption or emission properties of the emitted photons are not considered, rather only the resulting excited ions are mass- selected, detected and measured. Depending on the laser light source used, one electron can be removed from each atom so that resonance ionization produces an efficient selectivity in two ways: elemental selectivity in ionization and isotopic selectivity in measurement. During resonance ionization, an ion gun creates a cloud of atoms and molecules from a gas-phase sample surface and a tunable laser is used to fire a beam of photons at the cloud of particles emanating from the sample (analyte). An initial photon from this beam is absorbed by one of the sample atoms, exciting one of the atom's electrons to an intermediate excited state. A second photon then ionizes the same atom from the intermediate state such that its high energy level causes it to be ejected from its orbital; the result is a packet of positively charged ions which are then delivered to a mass analyzer. Resonance ionization contrasts with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) in that the latter is neither selective nor efficient since resonances are seldom used to prevent interference. Also, resonance ionization is used for an atomic (elemental) analyte, whereas REMPI is used for a molecular analyte. The analytical technique on which the process of resonance ionization is based is termed resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS). RIMS is derived from the original method, resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS), which was initially being used to detect single atoms with better time resolution. RIMS has proved useful in the investigation of radioactive isotopes (such as for studying rare fleeting isotopes produced in high-energy collisions), trace analysis (such as for discovering impurities in highly pure materials), atomic spectroscopy (such as for detecting low-content materials in biological samples), and for applications in which high levels of sensitivity and elemental selectivity are desired. History Resonance ionization was first used in a spectroscopy experiment in 1971 at the Institute for Spectroscopy Russian Academy of Sciences; in that experiment, ground George Samuel Hurst led the photophysics group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory that measured, for the first time, the population of metastable helium particles using resonance ionization. state rubidium atoms were ionized using ruby lasers.[4] In 1974, a group of photophysical researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory led by George Samuel Hurst developed, for the first time, the resonance ionization process on helium atoms. They wanted to use laser light to measure the number of singlet metastable helium, He (21S), particles created from energetic protons. The group achieved the selective ionization of the excited state of an atom at nearly 100% efficiency by using pulsed laser light to pass a beam of protons into the helium gas cell. The experiment on singlet metastable helium atoms was seminal in the journey towards using resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS) for extensive atomic analysis in research settings. Cesium atoms was subsequently used to show that single atoms of an element could be counted if its resonance ionization was performed in a counter in which an electron could be detected for an atom in its ground state. Subsequently, advanced techniques categorized under resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) were used to generate the relative abundance of various ion types by coupling the RIS lasers to magnetic sector, quadrupole, or time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers. The field of resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS) has largely been shaped by the formal and informal communications heralding its discovery. Research papers on RIS have heavily relied on self-citation from inception, a trend which climaxed three years later with the founding of a company to commercialize the technique.  Method  A model resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) set-up consists of a laser system (consisting of multiple lasers), sample from which the atoms are derived, and a suitable mass spectrometer which mass-selectively detects the photo ions created from resonance. In resonant ionization, atoms or molecules from ground state are excited to higher energy states by the resonant absorption of photons to produce ions. These ions are then monitored by appropriate detectors. In order to ensure a highly-efficient sensitivity and process saturation, the atomic or molecular beam must be formed from the ground state, the atoms should be efficiently excited and ionized, and each atom should be converted by the photon field of a short-timed pulsed laser to produce a positive ion and a valence electron. In a basic RIS process, a pulsed laser beam produces photons of the right energy in order to excite an atom initially in its ground state, a, to an excited level, b. During the laser pulse, the ion population of state b increases at the expense of that of state a. After a few minutes, the rate of stimulated emission from the excited state will equal rate of production so that the system is in equilibrium as long as the laser intensity is kept sufficiently high during a pulse. This high laser intensity translates into a photon fluence (photons per unit of beam area) large enough so that a necessary condition for the saturation of the RIS process has been met. If, in addition, the rate of photoionization is greater than the rate of consumption of intermediates, then each selected state is converted to one electron plus one positive ion, so that the RIS process is saturated. A usually efficient way to produce free atoms of an element in the ground state is to atomize the elements by ion sputtering or thermal vaporization of the element from a laser matrix under vacuum conditions or at environments with pressures significantly less than normal atmospheric pressure. The resulting plume of secondary atoms is then channeled through the path of multiple tuned laser beams which are capable of exciting consecutive electronic transitions in the specified element. Light from these tuned lasers promotes the desired atoms above their ionization potentials whereas interfering atoms from other elements are hardly ionized since they are generally transparent to the laser beam. This process produces photoions which are extracted and directed towards an analytical facility such as a magnetic sector to be counted. This approach is extremely sensitive to atoms of the specified element so that the ionization efficiency is almost 100% and also elementally selective, due to the highly unlikely chance that other species will be resonantly ionized. To achieve high ionization efficiencies, monochromatic lasers with high instantaneous spectral power are used. Typical lasers being used include continuous-wave lasers with extremely high spectral purity and pulsed lasers for analyses involving limited atoms. Continuous-wave lasers however are often preferred to pulsed lasers due to the latter‚Äôs relatively low duty cycle since they can only produce photo ions during the brief later pulses, and the difficulty in reproducing results due to pulse-to-pulse jitters, laser beam drifting, and wavelength variations. Moderate laser powers, if high enough to affect the desired transition states, can be used since the non-resonant photoionization cross section is low which implies a negligible ionization efficiency of unwanted atoms. The influence of the laser matrix to be used for the sample can also be reduced by separating evaporation and ionization processes both in time and in space. Another factor that could affect the efficiency and selectivity of the ionization process is the presence of contaminants caused by surface or impact ionization. This can be reduced up to appreciable orders of magnitude by using mass analysis so that isotopic compositions of the desired element are determined. Most of the elements of the Periodic Table can be ionized by one of the several excitation schemes available. The suitable excitation scheme depends on certain factors including the level scheme of the element‚Äôs atom, its ionization energy, required selectivity and sensitivity, likely interference, and the wavelengths and power levels of the available laser systems. Most excitation schemes vary in the last step, the ionization step. This is due to the low cross-section for non-resonant photo-ionization produced by the laser. A pulsed laser system facilitates the efficient coupling of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF- MS) to the resonance ionization set-up due to the instrument's abundance sensitivity. This is because TOF systems can produce an abundance sensitivity of up to 104 whereas magnetic mass spectrometers can only achieve up to 102. The total selectivity in a RIS process is a combination of the sensitivities in the various resonance transitions for multiple step-wise excitations. The probability of an atom to come in contact with the resonance of another atom is about 10‚àí5. The addition of a mass spectrometer increases this figure by a factor of 106 such that the total elemental selectivity surpasses or at least compares to that of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the most selective technique available.  Optical excitation and ionization schemes  Optical ionization schemes are developed to produce element-selective ion source for various elements. Most of the elements of the periodic table have been resonantly ionized by using one of five major optical routes based on the principle of RIMS. The routes were formed by the absorption of two or three photons to achieve excitation and ionization and are provided on the basis of optically possible transitions between atomic levels in a process called the bound-bound transition. For an atom of the element to be promoted to a bound- continuum, the energies emitted from the photons must be within the energy range of the selected tunable lasers. Also, the ionization energy of the last emitted photon must exceed that of the atom. The optical ionization schemes are denoted by the amount of photons necessary to make the ion pair. For the first two Schemes 1 and 2, two photons (and processes) are involved. One photon excites the atom from the ground state to an intermediate state while the second photon ionizes the atom. In Schemes 3 and 4, three photons (and processes) are involved. The first two distinct photons create consecutive bound-bound transitions within the selected atom while the third photon is absorbed for ionization. Scheme 5 is a three-photon two-intermediate-level photoionization process. After the first two photons have been absorbed by the optical energy, the third photon achieves ionization. The RIS process can be used to ionize all elements on the periodic table, except helium and neon, using available lasers. In fact, it is possible to ionize most elements with a single laser set-up, thus enabling rapid switching from one element to another. In the early days, optical schemes from RIMS have been used to study over 70 elements and over 39 elements can be ionized with a single laser combination using a rapid computer-modulated framework that switches elements within seconds. Applications Surface analysis resonance ionization uses a multi-step excitation technique to avoid the interference of background atoms in detecting trace amounts of impurities on material surfaces. This ultra- sensitive technique is especially important in the manufacture of super- miniature semiconductors. As an analytical technique, RIS is useful based on some of its working operations ‚Äì they include extremely low detection limit so that mass of samples could be identified up to the order of 10‚àí15, the extremely high sensitivity and elemental selectivity useful in micro- and trace analysis when coupled with mass spectrometers, and ability of the pulsed laser ion source to produce pure isobaric ion beams. A major advantage of using resonance ionization is that it is a highly selective ionization mode; it is able to target a single type of atom among a background of many types of atoms, even when said background atoms are much more abundant than the target atoms. In addition, resonance ionization incorporates the high selectivity that is desired in spectroscopy methods with ultrasensitivity, thus making resonance ionization useful when analyzing complex samples with several atomic components. Resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS) thus has a wide range of research and industrial applications. These include characterizing the diffusion and chemical reaction of free atoms in a gas medium, solid state surface analysis using direct sampling, studying the degree of concentration variations in a dilute vapor, detecting the allowable limits of number of particles needed in a semiconductor device, and estimating the flux of solar neutrinos on Earth. Other uses include determining high-precision values for plutonium and uranium isotopes in a rapid fashion, investigating the atomic properties of technetium at the ultra trace level, and capturing the concurrent excitation of stable daughter atoms with the decay of their parent atoms as is the case for alpha particles, beta rays, and positrons. RIS is now in very common use in research facilities where the quick and quantitative determination of the elemental composition of materials is important. Pulsed laser light sources provide higher photon fluxes than continuous-wave lasers do, however the use of pulsed lasers currently limit vast applications of RIMS in two ways. One, photo ions are created only during short laser pulses, thus significantly reducing the duty cycle of pulsed resonance ionization mass spectrometers relative to their continuous-beam counterparts. Two, incessant drifts in laser pointing and pulse timing alongside jitters between pulses severely hamper chances of reproducibility. These issues affect the extent to which resonance ionization can be used to solve some of the challenges confronted by practical analysts today; even so, applications of RIMS are replete in various traditional and emerging disciplines such as cosmochemistry, medical research, environmental chemistry, geophysical sciences, nuclear physics, genome sequencing, and semiconductors.

Written by the band (Will Gould, Ian Miles, Hannah Greenwood, Sean Scott, Dan Bratton and Oliver Burdett), it was produced by Neil Kennedy and featured as the opening track on the band's 2017 debut studio album Eternity, in Your Arms. The song was released as the third single and music video from the album on 15 February 2017. Composition and lyrics \\"Black Rain\\" was one of the final songs written for Eternity, in Your Arms, and was intended to serve as a \\"dramatic\\" opener to the album. Creeper frontman Will Gould named the track as \\"one of [the band's] favourite\\" songs on the album, claiming that it \\"shows the full range of the band\\". The song is the band's first to feature a solo vocal by keyboardist Hannah Greenwood, who \\"yells\\" the line \\"So darling just you shut your pretty mouth\\" in the chorus. It also features additional guitar by James Harding, as well as a spoken word intro by Ellie Price of Southampton-based math rock band Signals. Upon the song's release, Gould and Greenwood described \\"Black Rain\\" as \\"a bitter love song\\". Reviewing the song for Upset magazine, Ali Shutler described the lyrical content of \\"Black Rain\\" as being \\"Soaked in heartbreak and dramatic consequences\\", proposing that it deals with the concept of \\"the frustrations of being young, free and wanting more centre stage\\" which, he claims, then lead to \\"uncertainty and self-doubt\\". Speaking about the style of the song for the NME, Anita Bhagwandas outlined that the song \\"opens with twinkly piano before a slathering of AFI-esque vocals amble up to provide perfect spookiness\\". Clash writer Dannii Leivers claimed that the song is influenced by the work of record producer Jim Steinman, describing it as a track which features \\"goth majesty\\". Promotion and release \\"Black Rain\\" was premiered worldwide on BBC Radio 1 as MistaJam's \\"Hottest Record in the World\\" for 14 February 2017. The song was released as a digital download the following day, alongside a music video for the track. The video was filmed in a church in London with director Jamie Carter, who also worked on the videos for \\"Suzanne\\" and \\"Hiding with Boys\\". Speaking about the making of the video, Carter revealed that it was inspired by the story of Romeo and Juliet, and that it was his favourite of the trilogy produced for Eternity, in Your Arms. Critical reception Media response to \\"Black Rain\\" was positive. Writing for Upset magazine, Ali Shutler hailed the song as the band's \\"latest and greatest\\" upon release. In a review of the single, Shutler described \\"Black Rain\\" as \\"Epic and built to inspire a thousand ideas\\", praising it as \\"the first time Creeper have properly stuck their flag in the ground, taken a little bit of everything they love, and proudly declared 'this is us'\\".

The terrain is very flat and soils are poor. The rivers flood annually. There are no roads in the region, and the dense rainforest is relatively intact, although plans to extend the Trans-Amazonian Highway through the region would presumably cause widespread damage to the habitat. Location The Juru√°-Purus moist forests ecoregion is in the state of Amazonas in northwest Brazil to the south of the Solim√µes, or upper Amazon River. It has an area of . The ecoregion is bounded to the north, east and south by stretches of the Purus v√°rzea ecoregion along the Solim√µes and Purus rivers. The ecoregion contains the Juru√° River, which has typical flora and fauna. Urban centers include Carauari, Tef√©, Coari and Juta√≠. The v√°rzea, or flooded forest, extends along rivers within the ecoregion. To the west the Juru√°-Purus moist forests adjoin the Southwest Amazon moist forests. The western boundary follows the boundary of \\"dense lowland ombrophilous Amazonian forest\\" defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in 1993. The limit in the southwest is northeast of the Carauari Arch, an ancient uplift zone. Physical The ecoregion is in the low Amazon basin, with elevations from above sea level. The terrain consists of flat, forest-covered plains cut by large, meandering rivers with many oxbow lakes and thousands of smaller watercourses, all of which flood each year. Major rivers include the Juta√≠, mid-lower Juru√°, Tef√©, Tapau√° and mid-lower Purus rivers. The sediments of the low Amazon basin were formed during the late Tertiary period, and are relatively young and easily eroded. For this reason the rivers are whitewater rivers that hold suspended mineral and organic sediments. Soils include sandy podzols and hydromorphic clay, typically acidic and low in nutrients. Ecology The Juru√°-Purus moist forests ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. It is part of the Southwestern Amazon Moist Forests global ecoregion, which also includes the Southwest Amazon moist forests, Purus-Madeira moist forests and Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Average temperatures are throughout the year. Annual precipitation averages , with as much as in some places. Monthly rainfall is typically , with least rain falling in July. =Flora= The ecoregion is almost completely covered in evergreen tropical rainforest. The forests have a high level of plant diversity. Thus there are over 60 species of trees in the family Sapotaceae. Near Carauari there are 250 tree species per hectare. There are many different timber species but no dense stands of timber. The canopy is usually dense and about high, with emergent trees up to high. In small patches the canopy is more open and the understory less dense. Trees generally have small diameters of less than , and rarely have trunks larger than wide. A few giant trees have trunks up to wide such as Cariniana decandra, Osteophloem platyspermum, Piptadenia suaveolens, genus Brosimum, Eschweilera blanchetiana and Sclerobium paraense. As with other parts of the Amazon rainforest the most important families of trees are Fabaceae, Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae, Moraceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae and Myristicaceae. Four common palms are Astrocaryum vulgare, Oenocarpus bataua, Attalea maripa and Socratea exorrhiza. Other common species are Eschweilera alba, Eschweilera odora, Pouteria guianensis, Vantanea guianensis, Ragala sanguinolenta, Licania apetala and Iryanthera ulei. =Fauna= Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek) Rivers such as the Purus and Tapau√° form barriers to movement of some species of primates and insects, with distinct subspecies on either side of the river. Many species are endemic to the eocregion. There are more than 170 species of mammals. Almost 120 species of mammals have been recorded at one location on the upper Urucu River. Mammals that move between flooded and terra firme forests include common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus),white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons), brown woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagotricha) and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu). Large mammals include silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), brown- throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), red brocket (Mazama americana), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira) and South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Species local to the Southwestern Amazon Moist Forests include the short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis), Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus), pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea), brown-mantled tamarin (Saguinus fuscicollis) and Goeldi's marmoset (Callimico goeldii). Endangered mammals include Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). There are over 550 species of birds, including many endemic species. Seasonal migrant birds includewhite-throated toucan (Ramphastos tucanus), parrots (genus Amazona) and macaws (genus Ara). Non-migratory birds include tanagers (genera Tangara and Tachyphonus), woodcreepers (genus Xiphorhynchus), pavonine quetzal (Pharomachrus pavoninus), wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), nocturnal curassow (Nothocrax urumutum), razor-billed curassow (Mitu tuberosum) and tinamous (genera Crypturellus and Tinamus). Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa) and green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster). Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". No roads cross the ecoregion, which is relatively inaccessible, although both flora and fauna are affected by hunting and extractive logging. Petrobras has undertaken oil and natural gas exploration in the region for many years, creating deforested patches. A large area of forest near Tef√© was cleared for an experimental agricultural project, but this was abandoned and the area is now covered in secondary forest. Urban centers and small farming settlements along the rivers are surrounded by land cleared for houses, agriculture and livestock pasturage. The expansion of small-scale livestock production poses a threat. A planned extension of the Trans-Amazonian Highway from L√°brea on the Purus River to Tabatinga on border between Peru, Brazil and Colombia would cause widespread habitat destruction.

It formerly served as a treatment facility for leprosy, and was called the National Leprosarium, Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center and Public Health Service Hospital No. 66. In 1992, the district included 24 contributing buildings and two contributing structures, most built during 1939‚Äì1941 by architect/builder Neill P. Thompson. with four photos and two maps With . It contains the National Hansen's Disease Museum, a historical museum about the facility.  History  = Plantation = The property was originally a sugar plantation. The main house was built in 1859 for sugar planter Robert C. Camp. = Private leper home = Located on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River in Carville, Louisiana, the National Leprosarium was one of two leprosy hospitals in the United States. An abandoned sugar plantation became the Louisiana Leper Home in 1894. Eventually the facility would develop into a hospital that promoted understanding, identification, and treatment of leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. But in the early days, there was no effective medical treatment, and patients entered the gates under mandatory quarantine and many never left the hospital again. The \\"Home\\" began work with a patient load of five men and two women in the 1890s. Louisiana Leper Home was known as \\"a place of refuge, not reproach; a place of treatment and research, not detention\\". It offered hope and a comfortable refuge from society. Over the next century, the property would develop into a world class hospital, housing hundreds of employees and patients, including married couples and children. = National Leprosarium = In 1921, the U.S. Public Health Service took control and the facility became U.S. Marine Hospital Number 66, the National Leprosarium of the United States. Patient Stanley Stein, known as \\"Carville's Crusader\\", began a two-page newsletter in 1931. It grew into The STAR, a world-renowned newspaper that is still in publication. When the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital system was abolished in 1981, the National Leprosarium was the only hospital that escaped transfer to another organization. This was due to the efforts of United States Congressman Gillis W. Long. He was an advocate for people living and working with Hansen's disease. Long was successful in lobbying Congress to keep Carville open for the patients who wanted to remain on site, even though mandatory quarantine ceased to be law some years before. In 1986, the facility became the Gillis W. Long Hansen‚Äôs Disease (Leprosy) Center; the name change was directly linked to Congressman Long's influence in keeping the hospital open. In 1992, the Carville Historic District was established and in 1996 the National Hansen‚Äôs Disease (Leprosy) Museum was founded. = Closure = The U.S. Congress passed a bill to relocate the Gillis W. Long Hansen‚Äôs Disease (Leprosy) Center to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and as of 1999 the National Hansen's Disease Programs continues its clinical care and research for Hansen's disease in Baton Rouge. The Federal Government returned the site to the State of Louisiana in 1999. The state of Louisiana created a military base where the Louisiana National Guard currently operates a boot-camp style school for at-risk youth. There are other military and government tenants onsite. In addition to the museum, up until 2015, the grounds remained home to a few elderly residents who chose to stay after the hospital's official closing. The Foundation for Historical Louisiana currently lists the site on its Treasures in Trouble list stating that many structures require extensive repairs and maintenance.  National Hansen's Disease Museum  The National Hansen‚Äôs Disease Museum's exhibits include a history of the Carville facility, the United States Public Health Service and Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul who cared for the residents. Other exhibits include a recreated 1940s-era patient's room, stories of patients, their daily lives as residents and the problems they faced and information on Hansen's disease and advances in treatment. Immediately after Hurricane Katrina, the town of Carville became the temporary home for thousands of National Guard troops and public health officials assisting with relief efforts. Museum officials interviewed several of the personnel and recorded their responses. They also photographed the damage in nearby communities and the tasks the workers faced to help restore these areas. The museum created a new collection for these materials. Other archival collections include photos and records of the Daughters of Charity who worked as nurses, teachers, researchers, medical librarians, and pharmacists from 1896 to 2005; The 66 Star a bi-monthly patient newsletter issued between 1931 and 1934 and its successor, The STAR, which began publication in 1941 and continues today. The archives also holds copies of The Question Mark, a student newsletter that began in the 1940s and The Point Clarion, the employee newsletter.  Architecture  The \\"anchor\\" for the Carville Historic District is the Indian Camp Plantation House, the antebellum main house of a sugar plantation which is the only surviving building from the plantation. It was > designed and built by New Orleans architect Henry Howard (and perhaps his > partner Albert Diettel) in 1859 for sugar planter Robert C. Camp. It is a > raised stucco over brick transitional Greek Revival Italianate mansion > featuring a central mass with a hexastyle double gallery and flanking two > story wings. Fluted Corinthian columns over heavily rusticated pillars > support the gallery. Column capitals are correctly fashioned from double > rows of acanthus leaf carvings with volutess or scrolls springing from the > centers. Rather thin, molded and decorated abacus blocks supply the > transition from columns to architrave. / The facade is well detailed with > Italianate features, including rows of brackets, segmental openings, and > panels.

She also worked with genre painting and portraits.  Biography  Anna Munthe-Norstedt was born in the parish of D√∂derhult in Oskarshamn, Sweden. She was the daughter of the pharmacist Martin Arnold Fredrik Munthe and his second wife Louisa Aurora Ugarsky. Her brother Axel Munthe (1857‚Äì1949) was a physician and writer. Her brother Arnold Munthe (1856‚Äì1926) was Swedish naval military and author. Her nephew Malcolm Munthe (1910‚Äì1995) was a British soldier, writer, and curator. Originally, she wanted to become an actress, but was met with solid resistance from her parents, so she decided to become a painter instead. With her father's support, she enrolled at the Swedish Craft Association's School (Svenska Sl√∂jdf√∂reningens skola). Founded in 1844 as a part-time art school for artisans, the first female students were admitted to the school during 1857. She studied at the school, which is now known as Konstfack, from 1869 to 1871. She then became a student of M√•rten Eskil Winge at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts from 1871 to 1875. She also took lessons from the lithographer, Carl Oskar Cardon (1812-1899). In 1875, she married the landscape painter, Reinhold Norstedt (1843-1911), and had a daughter who died in infancy. She was advised to take up painting as a serious, full-time pursuit to assuage her grief. In 1878, they moved to Paris. While there, she studied with Swedish painter Hugo Salmson (1843-1894) and Belgian painter, Alfred Stevens (1823-1906). It was during this time that she began to focus on still lifes featuring flowers. She was especially influenced by the works of Dutch artist Jan Davidszoon de Heem (1606‚Äì1684), which she saw at the Louvre. In 1881, they returned to Sweden and established a studio in Stockholm. In 1883, she had a major showing at the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 in Copenhagen. Following the establishment of an association of artists (Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet) opposed to the practices of the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, she and her husband originally supported them. However they disagreed with their tactics and reluctantly chose to side with the Academy. Later, they joined a new organization that was created by disgruntled artists from both sides, but it had little influence. After her husband's death in 1911, she moved to Helsingborg. Two years later, she married Frans Siberg (1861-1924), a veterinarian. She died in Helsingborg during 1936.

Baldwin, Richard D. Reddy, and Eugene D. White, Jr. as the Association for Voluntary Action Scholars (AVAS). History The vision of the founders was to create an independent and impartial forum for researchers in the fledgling field of voluntary action and citizen participation. For a long time, AVAS‚Äô annual conferences and quarterly journal were the only outlets available to scholars interested in this area of research. AVAS originally held parallel conferences with the Association for Volunteer Administration and the Association of Volunteer Bureaus. The first conference was held in Denver, Colorado in 1974. The first solo conference was held in 1982 in Lansing, Michigan. These annual conventions allowed the organization to fulfill its purpose, as stated in the by-laws, to \\"stimulate, coordinate, and otherwise aid the efforts of those engaged in research, other scholarship and professional activity related to the understanding and improvement of nonprofit organizations and voluntary action\\" by creating a face-to-face forum for idea exchange. AVAS‚Äô publications were a major part of its contribution to the research community. The newsletter begun in 1973 and contained information about events and individuals in the research community as well as information specific to the organization. Citizen Participation and Voluntary Action Abstracts appeared originally as a supplement to the first newsletter, bringing together a variety of resources for researchers working in this interdisciplinary field. Volunteer Administration was published by AVAS until 1982, and is now published by the Association of Volunteer Administrators as the Journal of Volunteer Administration. The Journal of Voluntary Action Research (JVAR) begun in 1972 and was, for a long time, the only scholarly journal focusing on all aspects of voluntary action research. In 1986 JVAR attempted to broaden its focus to include the rapidly growing field of nonprofit study by adding a subtitle: Studies of Voluntarism, Citizen Participation, Philanthropy, and Nonprofit Organizations. 1988 heralded a new publisher for the journal, and an entirely new name- Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly (NVSQ). More recently, the organization has collaborated with the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy on Research in Progress. ARNOVA's executive office moved from its original home at Boston College to Pennsylvania State University, and then again to the Lincoln Filene Center at Tufts University in 1986. In 1990 the office moved again to become loosely affiliated with the Department of Adult and Youth Education at Washington State University. Continuing financial problems and low membership throughout the 1980s caused Delwyn A. Dyer to convene a Strategic Planning Committee in 1988. Following the committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors voted to change the organization's name from the narrowly focused Association for Voluntary Action Scholars to the more inclusive Association of Researchers on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA). The planning process continued at a retreat on February 8‚Äì10, 1991, in Corpus Christi, Texas. Board members focused on the need to upgrade the association's services, enhance its reputation, and reach out to include a diverse, interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners interested in voluntary action and nonprofit study. Following the retreat, Kirsten Gronbjerg (co-president 1993-1994) prepared a document stating ARNOVA's goals to present to possible funders. A second retreat was held at lifetime member David Mason's ranch on March 19‚Äì21, 1993. Decisions made at the Mason Ranch Retreat resulted in the formalization of ARNOVA's relationships with Independent Sector and the academic centers, and the affiliation of NVSQ with the Program on Non-Profit Organizations (PONPO) at Yale University and the executive office with the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy in 1994. These affiliations strengthened ARNOVA's position as a research organization. Consequent funding from the Ford Foundation and the Kellogg Foundation gave the organization the wherewithal to become the \\"interdisciplinary fellowship of scholars\\" its founders had envisioned.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Harbor Springs Depot. As of 2016, the building houses the Depot Club and Restaurant. History The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad built a line to service Petoskey in 1874. The greater access to the area led to an influx of new residents, and the village of Harbor Springs was incorporated in 1880. The railway constructed a branch line to Harbor Springs in 1882. This depot, designed by Grand Rapids architect Sidney J. Osgood, was constructed in 1889 to serve the railway. The Pennsylvania Railroad acquired the railroad in 1918. The station was at the end of a 7.9 mile short line, used for summer season trains timed to meet up in Petoskey with the Pennsylvania Railroad's Northern Arrow.Official Guide of the Railways, August 1938, Pennsylvania Railroad section, Tables 8, 193 The depot was in use as a passenger station until 1962. After the depot went out of service, the depot was purchased by the next door Walstrom Marine Company, and was leased seasonally by different retail businesses. In 1995, it was sold to a local builder, and in 2000 was sold again with the intention of rehabilitating the building. As of 2016, the building houses the Depot Club and Restaurant. Description The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Harbor Springs Depot is a single-story, ell-shaped Stick style/Eastlake building with a hipped roof. It consists of two parts: a long passenger wing with wide projecting eaves and a shorter baggage portion, with narrower overhangs, situated at right angles to the main section. The dominant architectural features of the building are the oversized, curving brackets supporting the wide eaves on the passenger wing. The building is clad with beveled clapboard, and contains double-hung windows and paneled doors. A large bay window, originally the ticket office, fronts onto Bay Street. Doors in the passenger section have a glassed transom; doors in the baggage section contain small square lights within the door itself. Two gables in the roof provide light to the attic. The original wood-shingled roof has been replaced with asphalt shingles' likely in the late 1940s. On the interior of the depot, the original passenger area has walls and ceiling finished in tongue-and-groove boarding, placed vertically below the level of the windowsills and horizontally above. It has the original maple flooring. The original baggage portion of the depot has more utilitarian walls and open-truss roof framing, and most of the floor is elevated to the height of a wagon to facilitate loading of baggage. Between the passenger area and the baggage room is the original ticket office containing the large bay window.

Chatam Sofer Memorial containing the graves of the Rabbis from the Old Jewish Cemetery is an important visiting site in Bratislava. The first record of the Jewish community in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, dates from 1251. Until the end of World War I, Bratislava (known as Pressburg or Pozsony through much of its history) was a multicultural city with a Hungarian and German majority and a Slovak and Jewish minority. In 1806 when the city was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, Rabbi Moses Sofer established the Pressburg Yeshiva and the city emerged as the center of Central European Jewry and a leading power in the opposition to the Reform movement in Judaism in Europe. Pressburg Yeshiva produced hundreds of future leaders of Austro-Hungarian Jewry who made major influence on the general traditional orthodox and future Charedi Judaism. The Bratislava Jewish Community was the largest and most influential in Slovakia. In 1930, approximately 15,000 Jews lived in the city (total population was 120,000). Part of the community emigrated during the late 1930s and after the Second World War but despite organized efforts such as the Bratislava Working Group, the majority of Bratislava Jews perished in the Holocaust. Today, Bratislava features the Heydukova Street Synagogue, Museum of Jewish Culture, Bratislava Jewish Community Museum, the Chatam Sofer Memorial, the Neolog cemetery and the Orthodox cemetery and many other Jewish landmarks and monuments. Bratislava Jewish Community comprises approximately 500 people and since 1993, the Chief Rabbi of Slovakia and Rabbi of Bratislava is Baruch Myers.  Early history  Jews mocking the Host in Pressburg (Bratislava); antisemitic woodcut from 1591. It is known that Jews were active as traders and liaisons between the Roman legions and Germanic tribes north of the river Danube. The area of today's Bratislava was at the crossroads of important trade routes and Jews passed through this area from the 1st century CE, although there are no records of them settling here. Jews started to migrate in larger numbers to Upper Hungary in the 11th century as first Jewish settlements appeared also in Bratislava. Bratislava Jews of this time had strong connections to the Jewish Community of Esztergom. The first Jewish religious community in Bratislava was founded in the late 13th century, as evidenced by the Menor Codex (Memorbuch) from Mainz. Sometime between 1250 and 1300, the Rabbi of Bratislava was Jonah (or Yonah). Bratislava Jews always formed a compact community somewhat closed to the outside world. They were employed in finance, as merchants, craftsmen, artisans and even winemakers and they lived in the areas of today's Nedbalova Street, Franti≈°k√°nska Street, Z√°moƒçn√≠cka Street and Ba≈°tov√° Street. Decree of Andrew II of Hungary from 1229 granted the Jewish minority equal rights as the citizens of Bratislava. Jews became represented by a Jewish Mayor, elected from the ranks of Christian citizens by the King and since 1440 by the Bratislava City Council. The existence of a synagogue in the city is attested by a 1335 decree of Pope Benedict XII which mentions a letter from the local Cistercian Order to the Archbishop of Esztergom asking him to have the Jewish temple demolished. It is one of the first written mentions of Jews living in the city. The Cistercian Cloister stood near the today's cloister on Ur≈°ul√≠nska Street with the synagogue directly next to it. The Pope had the Archbishop investigate the situation and soon afterwards, the synagogue was demolished. A gothic entrance portal from this synagogue was uncovered in the 1990s, it is located in the courtyard of a building on Pansk√° Street No. 11. The synagogue was rebuilt in 1339. In the 14th century there were several hundred Jews living in Bratislava and the city featured a synagogue, a Jewish cemetery, a mikveh and other public Jewish institutions. In 1360, all Jews were expelled from Bratislava and their belongings were confiscated, part of the community found refuge in the town of Hainburg an der Donau. In 1367 or 1368 several Jewish families were permitted to return. In 1399 permission was granted for construction of a synagogue, probably at the place of the formerly destroyed one. At the end of the 14th century, there were approximately 800 Jews living in the city (total population of the city in 1435 was 5,000). During the first half of the 15th century Jews were forced to live in a Jewish ghetto on Jewish Street. At the end of the 15th century, Bratislava City Council implemented the 1215 decree of Pope Innocent III which ordered that Jews are required to wear distinct clothing, by ordering the Bratislava Jews to wear a red hooded cape at all times, in order to be visible from the distance. In 1506, Vladislaus II of Hungary tried to prevent Jews from leaving Bratislava by confiscating the property of anyone who left. In 1520, Louis II of Hungary decreed that Jews no longer had to wear distinct clothing but it wasn't until the Prefect of Bratislava Jewry Jakub Mendel complained directly to the King in 1521, that the city was forced to change the law. Despite discrimination, the community grew and was allowed to build a second synagogue. Jews were expelled and accepted back several times in history of Bratislava, but after the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526 they were expelled permanently as part of the general expulsion from the Kingdom of Hungary. The synagogue was torn down and a monastery was built in its place. Many Bratislava Jews fled into neighboring Austria but a few remained in an area called Schlossgrund, outside of the walled city. Most of them left in 1572 on the orders of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1599, Count Nicolaus P√°lffy ab Erd√∂d inherited the Bratislava Castle and the Schlossgrund area and allowed Jews to settle here. In 1670, when the Jews of Vienna were expelled, many refugees settled in Schlossgrund and a Jewish quarter later becoming synonymous with the Vydrica area began to form. The size of the Jewish population of Bratislava in the Middle Ages varied from several hundred to 900 Jewish citizens. Podhradie) in the 17th century. As early as 1689 a Chevra Kadisha operated in Bratislava along with other charitable institutions. A Jewish cemetery was established on the outskirts of the city which later became known as the Old Jewish Cemetery. In 1707, there were 200 Jewish families living in Schlossgrund under the protection of the noble P√°lffy ab Erd√∂d family, most of them refugees. In 1709 Jewish population was 189, in 1732, there were 50 Jewish families living in Schlossgrund, and in 1736 the population was 772. Jews were permitted to return to the city in the 1700s, and the population increased to 2,000 Jews by the end of the 18th century. During the 18th century the city was home to a yeshiva, which under the direction of Meir Halberstadt attracted many rabbis into the city.  Pressburg Yeshiva and rise in importance  Chatam Sofer, a leading Orthodox rabbi of European Jewry in the first half of the nineteenth century, settled in Bratislava in 1806. Rabbi Akiva Sofer greeting Franz Joseph I of Austria on his official visit to Bratislava in 1913. In 1806, Moses Sofer accepted a rabbinate in Bratislava and settled in the city. In the same year, he established the Pressburg Yeshiva which was the largest and most influential Yeshiva in Central Europe in the 19th century. During Sofer's tenure as the Rabbi of Bratislava (1806 ‚Äì 1839), the yeshiva was attended by hundreds of students. After Sofer's death in 1839, his son Samuel Benjamin Sofer known as the Ktav Sofer became the Rabbi of Bratislava. After his death in 1871, his son Simcha Bunim Sofer known as the Shevet Sofer became Rabbi. The last Rabbi of Bratislava from the Schreiber ‚Äì Sofer dynasty was Akiva Sofer known as the Daas Sofer, who emigrated in 1939 to Mandatory Palestine and later re-founded the yeshiva in Jerusalem. On 5 June 1839, the Diet of Hungary convened in Bratislava and in 1840 passed a law enabling Jews to freely settle in any free city. During and after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, there were pogroms on Bratislava Jews. In 1864 a synagogue, later to be called the Bratislava Orthodox Synagogue, was built on Z√°mock√° Street in Schlossgrund. A progressive Jewish elementary school was established in the city despite opposition from the Rabbi of Bratislava Samuel Benjamin Sofer. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the General Jewish Congress of Budapest, attended also by delegates from Bratislava, tried to unify Hungarian Jews. The efforts failed and in 1868 Hungarian Jewry split into three factions: Orthodox, Neolog (reform), and Status Quo. There were approximately 1,000 Orthodox Jewish families in the city and approximately 60 Neolog Jewish families. In 1872, under Rabbi Samuel Benjamin Sofer the Bratislava Jewish community split, The smaller Neolog community established a separate Chevra Kadisha, synagogue, and other establishments. In 1897, the first Zionist group active in Bratislava, Ahavat Zion, was formed. In 1902, the Hungarian Zionist Organization was established in Bratislava, in 1904 the World Mizrachi Organization was established, both on the initiative of Samuel Bettelheim. At the beginning of the 20th century, conditions began to steadily improve, and many Bratislava Jews acquired university education. They started to influence the life and commerce in Bratislava. In the 1900 local elections, 24 Jews were elected to the Bratislava city council. According to the 1910 census, there were 8,027 Jews living in the city. In 1913, the Jewish quarter in Schlossgrund was ravaged by fire but was quickly rebuilt. During the First World War, several hundred Bratislava Jews served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and around 50 were killed. After the war, Austria-Hungary collapsed and the events were accompanied by attacks on Jews, which continued during the Hungarian Revolution of 1919 and ceased only after the newly created Czechoslovak regime established control in 1919. The community was partially protected by a guard formed by Jewish soldier veterans. During the interwar period, many Bratislava Jews owned businesses and many were employed as doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, artists and more. In the early 1920s there were approximately 11,000 Jews in Bratislava, 3,000 Neolog and 8,000 Orthodox. In the 1930 there were 14,882 Jews in the city (12% of the total population), 5,597 of declared Jewish nationality. In the 1938 elections, Kraus of the Jewish National Party was elected Deputy Mayor of Bratislava, and three Jews were elected to the Bratislava city council. The four most prominent organizations influencing the life of Bratislava Jews as well as Slovak Jews in general during the interwar period were the Jewish Party, the Orthodox community, Yeshurun - the liberal community, and the Histadrut.  Destruction of the Bratislava Jewry  Mikul√°≈°ska Street and ≈Ωidovsk√° Street, part of the former Jewish Quarter in Bratislava in the 1930s. In the late 1930s, antisemitic riots threatened the Jewish population of Bratislava. It was during this time that Imi Lichtenfeld helped to defend his Jewish neighborhood against racist gangs by utilizing principles he would later use to found the martial art Krav Maga. On 11 November 1938, violent attacks on the Bratislava synagogues and the Pressburg Yeshiva occurred and sporadic pogroms continued during the war. After the creation of the Slovak State in March 1939, discriminatory measures were undertaken by the government against the Jewish minority. On 25 March 1942, deportations of Jews out of Slovakia commenced. German forces occupied Bratislava in September 1944 and the approximately 2,000 remaining Jews were sent to Auschwitz via the concentration camp in Sereƒè. Despite organized effort by the Bratislava Jewish Community, most of its members were ultimately deported into extermination camps in occupied Poland. In December 1944, Nazi Germany established the Engerau concentration camp in Petr≈æalka (German: Engerau). Engerau was a labor camp. On March 30, 1945 some of the remaining prisoners were killed by guards and the remaining inmates were sent on a death march to Bad Deutsch-Altenburg. Today, no evidence of the camp remains due to the large-scale construction project in Petr≈æalka later in the 20th century when the former village was transformed into the largest panel hause complex in Central Europe.  After World War II  Bratislava Neolog Synagogue built in 1893, demolished in 1967‚Äì1969. Of the over 15,000 Jews living in Bratislava in 1940, only approximately 3,500 survived World War II. Jews returning to Bratislava from the war met with indifference and sometimes even hostility. Many found new people living in their former homes. Immediately after the war, Bratislava became the centre of Slovak Jewry due to the fact that many Slovak Jewish survivors preferred to settle in Bratislava as opposed to their former hometowns in the country. On April 15, 1945, Max Weiss became the chairman of the revived Jewish community and prayer services were renewed in the Heydukova Street Synagogue. Jewish newspapers started to be printed and the community re-established a mikveh, ritual slaughter, kosher butcher and canteen, homes for the aged, schools and a hospital. Difficulties were encountered in recovering seized Jewish property taken by local Slovaks. These economic factors combined with deep-rooted and widespread antisemitism fueled by antisemitic propaganda caused the vast majority of Slovaks in Bratislava to feel hostile towards the Jews. Jews in the city were physically attacked during the Partisan Congress riots (1‚Äì6 August 1946) and later riots on 20‚Äì21 August 1948. At the same time, Bratislava became a major transit point for Polish, Hungarian and Romanian Jews who survived the war and were headed for the transit camp in the Rothshild Hospital in Vienna in the American Occupation Zone in Austria run by the Jewish Agency. From 1945 until February 1949, more than 150,000 Jewish migrants passed through Bratislava, most of them leaving though the border at Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves. Refugees were at first housed in a camp in Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves and later in several Bratislava hotels (Hotel Central and Hotel Jele≈à) and the ≈ΩNO kitchen in Bratislava. These Jews were met with no sympathy from the citizens of Bratislava, who feared that the migrants might settle in the city. In 1949, the communist regime came into power in Czechoslovakia. The majority of war survivors decided to emigrate out of Slovakia. Of the 30,000 Jews who remaining in Slovakia at the end of World War II, 90% emigrated in the following months and years. The Jewish quarter in Podhradie, a historical part of Bratislava, was demolished in the 1960s by the communist authorities of the city. The Museum of Jewish Culture was established in 1994 as a branch of the Slovak National Museum.  Gallery  Image:Bratislava pamatnik holokaustu.jpgThe Bratislava holocaust memorial.

Trained in Western painting techniques while living in France, her work is known for its combination of European and Chinese formal elements. Called \\"one of the most important and prolific Chinese artists of the modern era,\\" her work has been the subject of retrospective exhibitions at the Hood Museum of Art, the Mus√©e Cernuschi, and the Fung Ping Shan Museum.  Background  Born in Fuzhou, Fan was the eleventh child of a wealthy merchant family. In 1912, she moved to France with her older sister Junying and sister-in-law Zeng Xing. From 1917 Fan studied art at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris and then at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Bordeaux, where she graduated in 1920. Upon her return to China, she became closely associated with the Lingnan School of traditional Chinese painters based in Shanghai. Forced into exile with the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Fan fled to Paris and eventually moved to Boston in 1957, returning to China only once in 1972. She finally moved to Geneva in 1983, where she lived until her death.  Career  While studying in France, Fan became the first Chinese female student to enter the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts exhibition. She was also the first Chinese female artist to be included in the annual Salon Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßaises. Fan published books in China on her oil painting, including a 1938 volume with a foreword by Cai Yuanpei, former Chinese Minister of Education and a classical scholar. She met Qi Baishi in 1943 and worked in close contact with him until leaving China, producing a series of solo exhibitions from 1944 to 1949.  Work  Fan's early works reflect the Impressionist style of French artists like Paul-Albert Besnard, with whom she studied in 1926. After returning to China, Fan became one of a number of 20th-century Chinese artists who sought to revitalize the tradition of Chinese brush-and-ink painting as a self-conscious expression of national identity. Her work from this period is particularly influenced by the founders of the Lingnan School, Gao Jianfu (1879‚Äì1951) and his brother Gao Qifeng (1889‚Äì1935), who combined Western pictorial devices such as single-point perspective and atmospheric light with highly naturalistic and patriotic scenes of modern-day life in China.

Joseph learned to play drums and piano while Daniel played flute. Both brothers began taking ballet classes (Joseph at age 7), studying under two well-known teachers in Dayton: Hermine and Josephine Schwarz. Joseph and Daniel were both considered to be very promising, and at age 10, Joseph received a Ford Foundation scholarship to continue his training. At age 15, Joseph was recruited by the School of American Ballet and traveled to New York for their summer session. Joseph stayed as a full-time scholarship student.The Private Agony and Death of Joseph Duell, Gifted Dancer. New York Times. February 18, 1986.  Career  In 1975, Joseph followed his brother Daniel in joining the New York City Ballet corps. It was around this time that he began to harbor a \\"secret competitive feeling\\" with Daniel, he would confess years later. The intensity of these competitive thoughts and feelings of inadequacy led him to a deep depression, and after a year and a half Joseph dropped out of the company. He later recounted in a New York Times interview, \\"I couldn't avoid the comparison with Dan and other boys who were physically much more knit ... I hadn't yet worked out who I was and why I was dancing.\\" However, four months after he dropped out, Joseph returned to the company more driven than ever. Apparently having moved past his internal crisis, he and his brother became very close again, and Joseph worked hard to perfect his art. Suki Schorer, a former teacher at the School of American Ballet who worked with Joseph during this period said of him, \\"What God gave him to dance with wasn't terrific, but he took it and became a beautiful dancer, performing with a great musical sense.\\" In 1980, Joseph was promoted to soloist, and in 1982 as a choreographer he made his debut with the company, La Creation Du Monde, which was well received by the critics. His dancing career flourished, and in 1984 he was promoted to principal.  Personal life  According to his close friends and colleagues, Joseph was a man of deep thought who approached his art with an obsessive, mechanical, and often frustrated passion. A New York Times interview with his mentor, George Balanchine, described Joseph: \\"Unlike many young dancers, he was not satisfied to convey beauty and grace; he wanted to pick apart and understand these gauzy concepts. Mr. Duell did not merely want to perform the fifth position in ballet; he wanted to know why the fifth position was central to classical technique.\\" His friend and fellow dancer, Toni Bentley, said of Joseph, \\"He was extremely intense and very introverted sometimes - you'd see him thinking, and he wouldn't even see you.\\" Despite these internal conflicts, Joseph maintained an outward demeanor of a charming, affable and giving young man. Only later would he confess in an interview that he was battling depression and personal demons of high creative standards and long-ago sibling rivalry. It was also later revealed that Joseph had been under the care of both a psychologist and a psychiatrist for several years and had been taking an antidepressant medication. Some friends said they noticed that he seemed more depressed in his last days. An official of the ballet company said, \\"Everyone was worried about him in the last two weeks. He was terribly overstrung in the last couple of weeks, and he began to talk about being depressed, but he wasn't the type to burden people with his problems.\\"  Death  The day before Joseph's death, Saturday, February 15, Joseph made his final performance in George Balanchine's Symphony in C. That evening he was seen by his brother Daniel who would later tell the police that Joseph had been feeling dejected, but Daniel \\"didn't think anything was really wrong,\\" according to Martin Duffy, the investigating detective in the 20th Precinct. That night, according to fellow dancer Toni Bentley, Joseph immersed himself in work. He went to rehearsal and \\"worked like crazy on 'Who Cares?' the Gershwin ballet.\\" She added, \\"He hadn't gone and holed himself up. He had many chances to reach out.\\" The following morning, Sunday, February 16 at around 10 A.M. according to police, Joseph jumped from the fifth-story window of his West 77th Street apartment in Manhattan and died at the scene. No note or explanation was found. Jerome Robbins dedicated his ballet \\"Quiet City\\" (with music by Aaron Copeland) to Joseph's memory.

He composed (and by itself orchestrated) a respectable opus of more than 650 musical works, concert and musical-stage forms, ranging from small, instrumental and chamber shape to big orchestral symphonic works and ten large music and music- theatrical works of contemporary forms and synthesis involving opera, musical theatre and ballet, stage music and other musical forms. His music has been performed in productions of companies such as Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, NT Vara≈ædin, Croatian National Theatre in Split, Croatian National Theatre in Osijek, Gavella Drama Theatre, Zagreb Youth Theatre, Zagreb Theatre Komedija, City Theater ≈Ωar Ptica, Satirical Theatre Kerempuh Zagreb, Cankarjev Dom-Ljubljana, Maribor Slovene National Theatre, then Croatian Radiotelevision, Orpheus, Suzy, Zagreb Film, Maxima-movie, Inter-movie, Positive film, with numerous performances in Croatia and in a number of European and non-European countries.  Early life  Since the beginning of his involvement with music of classical foundation Hajsek showed tendencies towards a broader spectrum of musical expressions and has developed the ability to express a full range of musical styles that are used in his creative work, sometimes as musical lexicon in pure form and sometimes as elements of peculiar authorial synthesis and recognizable composer's \\"touch\\". His interest in music, musical talent and composer's impulse he has expressed at an early age, starting to intensively compose in the seventies, at 15 years of age writing his first elements of symphony. He began composing in adolescence, from the beginning of his career in 1989, working exclusively as a composer, with 27 years of professional compositional work behind his name.  Career  = Early career = Since the middle of the 70's Hajsek began developing his composing style, which included elements of classical, electrophonic and 'avant-garde' music, antic musical tradition with elements of jazz and archaic music. In the 80's he turns more towards orchestral music and finds inspiration in the works of great composers of the 20th century such as Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Alberto Ginastera and Aaron Copland, but also in the avant-garde and electronic music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Schaeffer, Edgard Var√®se, La Monte Young, Terry Riley and John Chowning, Krzysztof Penderecki, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and John Cage and composing works on the basis of such inspiration, while on the other hand being inspired by alternative rock and progressive music (Keith Emerson) and the works of New York music and art scene, with artists like John Cale, Andy Warhol and Brian Eno, and authors like Tom Waits and Nick Cave. = 1980s = Hajsek studied classical composition, polyphony, harmony and counterpoint at the Academy of Music, University of Zagreb, specializing on seminars of contemporary and electrophonic music. From that time dates the author's collaboration with big American avant-garde composer Alvin Lucier, with following compositions standing out in particular: \\"Sounds from Lost in Space\\" for chamber orchestra and electronics and \\"2 Loud Sounds 4 4 Steel Strings\\" for double string orchestra, \\"Passacaglia\\" for big orchestra, \\"Alpine Symphony\\" and the ballet \\"Mishima\\". = 1990s = In the 90's Hajsek worked intensively on new musical works and develops his own composing and performing techniques, while experimenting with new forms, which resulted in a particularly interesting work \\"The sound of the earth\\" for chamber orchestra, electronics and instruments, created as works of art by the most famous visual artists which has caused great interest and positive reactions in Croatia and abroad, presented by leading Swiss magazine for culture, one of the most influential in the world. = Modern rock = Hajsek composed, arranged and played for many famous Croatian and Bosnian rock bands and their members (Bijelo Dugme, Divlje Jagode, Drugi naƒçin, Vje≈°tice, Peti Element). He also collaborated with many renowned jazz musicians (Csaba Deseo, Domagoj Rala≈°iƒá, Miro Kadoiƒá). One of his projects in early 2000s was Van Hajsek Orchestra, a group whose music is based on combination of elements of classical, ethno, popular, commercial and rock music, thus having nothing in common with the usual gig production and performance. = Film scoring and media production = Hajsek composed high number of works related to media and multimedia production and worked on theater and film projects. In that period came two interesting cantatas for choir and orchestra \\"Mother\\", \\"Next to the river of Babylon\\" and \\"Wave\\" for eight voice choir, \\"Antistema ghithago\\" electrophonic music, 2nd Symphony, and the music for great animated series \\"The Pomkiners\\" which has undergone numerous broadcast around the world (Canada, United States, UK, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland etc.) valued also because of the author's music. The beginning of the third millennium has been characterized in the author's work by large number of new compositions and more interest towards music theater works and film music, working on a variety of film projects, with four long length movies \\"Madonna\\", \\"Sleep Sweet, My Darling\\", \\"The Man Under the Table\\" and \\"Walt Disney's Mousetrap\\" standing out, just as dozens of short films and documentaries and art films of animation in which he collaborated with great artists within the field, such as Milan Bla≈æekoviƒá, winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, Zlatko Bourek and many other renowned artists. The Vijenac, Croatian magazine for literature, art and science, at the time of Hajsek's film work, praises Hajsek's composing abilities and, regarding Hajsek's masterwork on the Madonna soundtrack, puts authentic Croatian soundtrack business industry in high perspective for the future. He composed music for number of art movies, like \\"Theory of Reflection\\", \\"Malformance-Performance\\", \\"Leaf on Water\\", \\"On the Gallery\\" and others. Musical works of particular interest from this period, amongst others, were \\"Sonata for piano and percussion\\", \\"Allegro Spicatto\\" for chamber orchestra, \\"Fuga Primavera\\" and \\"Fuga Polaris\\" for big orchestra, \\"Symphony of Istria\\", \\"Opera Furiosa\\", string quintet \\"In the evening\\" and \\"Mare Stellarum\\" electrophonic composition. = Relationship to theatre and film = Hajsek's professional composing career has always been related to theater and he wrote a large number of musical and theater related works in the forms of modern synthesis of opera, theater and musicals, field within he cooperated with American Broadway musical-director Seth Weinstein. They successfully collaborated on the theater project Black House (), an original Croatian musical composed and authored by Hajsek. The musical had a great reception and was called a \\"successful blend of home-made satire with a fresh breath of Broadway\\". The main difference in terms of traditional film and theater music and composer's concept is that the composer's works in the field of theater and film are complete musical forms, so in fact representing concert works intended for independent concert performance. One of the major projects in Hajsek's relationship to theatre is The Asphalt Rose, which premiered in 2007. The project, based on book by Igor Weidlich, was, at the time of its opening, the first original Croatian musical in more than a decade to be performed at the Zagreb Theatre Komedija. Commenting the after-premiere of the musical Hajsek explains that the work connects \\"a postmodernist piece that has music with baroque, Viennese classics and romanticism, through twentieth-century styles, to the influence of music from different parts of the world, such as Cuba and Africa.\\" Hajsek's music structure is formed by variations in classical, ethno and modern music. Hajsek founded and led a full range of ensembles in classical music and various forms of contemporary music which involved a large number of prominent musicians and artists from Croatia and abroad, working also as a pianist performing his music and the music of other authors, with whom he has so far performed in places like Croatian Music Institute, Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall, Mimara, Arena in Pula and other secular/profane and sacred concert spaces locally and abroad. He also works as a music recording producer and musical director, primarily for his own music. For his composing work, the author has received numerous awards, amongst which the most important are two music awards Porin, that he achieved as the best composer for the soundtrack CD and for the best composition in the category of music for theater, film and TV projects and also the Golden Arena for Best Film Music for the best film music, \\"Golden Firebird\\" (in a competition between composers from 10 European countries and Israel) at the International Theatre Festival in Zagreb and other awards. = Selection of works = From approximately 1974: * Fuga on Mozart's theme for strings * Hommage a Debussy for piano * Tocatta for piano * Midnight for 2 guitars and celeste * \\"The Secret World\\" for wind orchestra * \\"Astral Vibrations\\" - electrophonic music * \\"Exhibition music\\" - electrophonic music * La cogida y la muerte: for choir, string orchestra and percussion (1983) * La sangre dermada: for choir, string orchestra and percussion (1984) * String Trio (1985) * \\"Passacaglia\\" for strings and orchestra (1987) * \\"Sounds from Lost in Space\\" for chamber orchestra and electronics (1988) * \\"2 Loud Sounds 4 4 Steel Strings\\" for double string orchestra- div. s 24 (1989) * \\"Mishima\\" ballet (1989) * \\"Alpine Symphony\\" (1990) * \\"The sound of the earth\\" for chamber orchestra, electronics and artistically crafted instruments (1992) * \\"Wave\\" for eight voice choir (1992) * 2 Symphony (1993) * \\"Mother\\" cantata for chorus and orchestra (1994) * \\"Antistema githago\\" Electronical music (1999) * \\"Night,\\" song for voice, piano and orchestra (1999) \\"PORIN\\" * \\"Pavane\\" - for Strings (2001) * \\"The Mediterranean\\" - for flute and organ (2001) * \\"Oceanus\\" - electrophonic music (2003) * \\"Waltz villa\\" for choir and orchestra (2004) * \\"On the eve\\" for Piano Quintet (2005) * \\"Mare Stellarum\\" - electrophonic music (2006) * \\"Dragon geometry\\" film Ballet (2007) * \\"Allegro spiccatto\\" - for chamber orchestra (2009) * \\"Fuga Polaris\\" - for big orchestra (2009) * \\"Fuga primavera\\" - for big orchestra (2009) * Sonata for piano and percussion (2010) * \\"Love in 4 dimensions\\" film Ballet (2009) * \\"The Ballad of Augustus\\" for choir and orchestra (2011) * \\"Aria bellissima\\" for voice and orchestra (2012) * Mazurka for Piano (2013) * \\"Dancing with the joke\\" - for orchestra (2013) * \\"Andante 2013 \\" for orchestra (2013) * Impromtus for piano (2015) Major musical theatre works, film and stage music (selection): * \\"Brigades of Beauty\\" stage music (1988) * \\"Mail\\" Rabindranath Tagore - stage music (1989) * \\"Antigone\\" stage music (1997) * \\"Golden Rose\\" stage music (1998) * \\"Medea\\" stage music (1999) * \\"Madonna (1999 film)\\" (1999) \\"PORIN\\" * \\"Walt Disney's Mousetrap\\" (2003) * \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" (2004) (musical) * \\"Sleep Sweet, My Darling\\" - \\"Golden Arena\\" for the original music for film (2005) * \\"Malformance - Performance\\" film art animation (2006) * \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\" stage music (2008) * \\"With all my heart\\" soundtrack (2007) * \\"Ru≈æa na asfaltu\\" (2007) * \\"Drazen\\" soundtrack (2008) * \\"Peter Pan\\" (musical) (2008) * \\"Maria Stuart\\" stage music (2009) * \\"Tango\\" (2009) (musical) * \\"The Man Under the Table\\" soundtrack (2009) * \\"Gri≈æula\\" (2009) (opera-musical) * \\"Pippi Longstocking\\" (2009) (musical) * \\"Time out\\" soundtrack (2009) * \\"Leaf on Water\\" musical art - film animation (2009) * \\"On the Gallery\\" musical art - film animation (2009) * \\"Class optimistic\\" soundtrack (2011) * \\"Zulejka\\" musical art -film animation (2012) * \\"Plitvice\\" musical documentary feature (2011) * \\"Salome\\" (2010) (musical) * \\"The underwater world of the Adriatic\\" musical documentary (2011) * \\"You're lying Melita '(2011) (musical) \\"Golden Firebird\\" * \\"Elektra\\" (2011) (musical) * \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" (2012) (opera-musical) * \\"Black House\\" - musical (2012) * \\"Crime and Punishment\\" (2013) (opera-musical) * \\"Tamara\\" \\"soundtrack (2013) * \\"Wild horses\\" musical (2014) * \\"Wolfdog\\" - (2014) (opera- musical) * \\"Opera furiosa\\" for soloists, chorus and orchestra (2014) * \\"Eco- eco\\" stage music (2014) * \\"Fisherman‚Äôs Tale\\" soundtrack (2015) * \\"Hromi ideali\\" - musical (2016)  References  External links  Darko Hajsek musical theatre at teatar.hr 1959 births Living people Croatian composers Croatian film score composers Croatian singer-songwriters Male film score composers Golden Arena winners People from Zagreb Croatian musical theatre composers ","title":"Darko Hajsek"},{"id":"53623902","text":"The Dixon County Courthouse in Ponca, Nebraska was built in 1883-84 and expanded in 1939‚Äì1940.

As a two-year-old she made only two appearances, winning a maiden race at the Curragh on her debut and then taking the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the same track. She was beaten on her first run of 1982 but then recorded her biggest win in the Irish 1000 Guineas. She was beaten in her last four races and was retired from racing at the end of the year. She had considerable success as a broodmare. Background Arctique Royale was a \\"lightly-made\\" bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by her owner Paddy Prendergast. She was trained throughout her racing career by her breeder's son Kevin Prendergast. She was sired by Royal and Regal, an American stallion who recorded his biggest win in the 1973 Florida Derby. Her dam Arctic Melody was a top-class racemare who defeated Aunt Edith in the 1965 edition of the Musidora Stakes before becoming a successful broodmare. Her other foals included Racquette (third in the Irish Oaks) and Le Melody, the dam of Ardross and the female-line ancestor of Electrocutionist and Scorpion. Racing career =1980: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut Arctique Royale started favourite for a maiden race over five furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse in May and won by two and a half lengths from Hear A Rhapsody after drawing clear of her ten opponents in the closing stages. Paddy Prendergast died in June and for the rest of the year the filly was owned by the executors of his estate. After a three-month break the filly returned in the Moyglare Stud Stakes (the a Group Two race over six furlongs) at the Curragh in August. Starting the 5/4 favourite she accelerated in the final furlong and won by a length from Lady Tiffany with the early leader Lady Nightingale three quarters of a length back in third place. Kevin Prendergast did not run the filly again that year, stating that she needed more time to mature. =1982: three-year- old season= Before the start of the 1982 season Arctique Royale was bought privately by the French owner Jean-Pierre Binet. The filly began her second campaign in the Athasi Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in April and sustained her first defeat as she finished fourth behind Martinova, Overplay and Castlemaine. On 23 May, ridden by Gabriel Curran, she was one of fifteen three-year-old fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile on heavy ground at the Curragh. Martinova started favourite ahead of Blue Wind with Arctique Royale the 7/1 joint third choice in the betting alongside the British-trained Star Pastures. In the last quarter mile the race devolved into a prolonged struggle between Arctique Royale and Blue Wind, with the Prendergast filly prevailing by a short head after a \\"fierce duel\\". Her win gave \\"Squibs\\" Curran his second and final Irish Classic after Nebbiolo in the 1977 Irish 2000 Guineas. Arctique Royale ran four more times before the end of the season without recovering her Classic winning form. At the Curragh in late June she was stepped up in distance for the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs but was beaten three lengths into second place by Happy Bride, a filly who had finished fifth in the Guineas. It was later reported that she had come into season shortly before the race. In the Irish Oaks on 18 July she started the 7/2 second favourite but never looked likely to win and finished sixth of the ten runners behind Blue Wind. After a two-month break she returned to the track and was matched against male opposition in the Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. She started a 16/1 outsider and finished sixth behind her owner's more fancied runner Kings Lake. On her final run she was sent to France and finished unplaced in the Prix de l'Op√©ra at Longchamp Racecourse in October. Assessment In 1980 the independent Timeform organisation gave Arctique Royal a rating of 102 p (the p indicating that she was expected to improve), making her 22 pounds inferior to Timeform's top two-year-old filly Marwell. In the Irish Free Handicap she was given a weight of 113 pounds, three pounds behind her stablemate Lady Blackfoot, who was the top-rated Irish-trained juvenile filly of the year. In the 1981 Irish Free Handicap Arctiue Royale was rated the fourth-best three- year-old filly in Ireland behind Blue Wind, Condessa and Happy Bride. Timeform gave her a rating of 113, 20 pounds behind their best three-year-old filly Marwell. Breeding record After retiring from racing, Arctique Royale became a broodmare. She produced fifteen foals and eight winners between 1983 and 1998: *Lake Success, a colt, foaled in 1983, sired by Kings Lake. Winner in France. *Gold and Glory, bay colt, 1984, by Golden Fleece *Truly Special, bay filly, 1985, by Caerleon.

Biography Salmson was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of Fredrik Ludvig Salmson and Maria Perlberg. His father was a wholesaler. He initially studied business, but soon decided on an artistic career. In 1862, he began his studies at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts where he was trained by Johan Christoffer Boklund. His painting of Sten Sture the Younger meeting Gustav Trolle in Uppsala Cathedral (1867) won him a Royal Medal and a travelling scholarship. In 1868, he went to Paris, via D√ºsseldorf. The classes taught by L√©on Bonnat and Alexandre Cabanel had no vacancies, so he took private lessons from Pierre-Charles Comte.Nordensvan, Georg (1928). Svensk Konst och Svenska Konstn√§rer i Nittonde √Örhundradet. Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag, s 215. He had his d√©but at the Salon in 1870 with a genre scene of a cottage in Dalarna titled R√©v√©lation. During the Franco-Prussian War, he lived and worked in Brussels. He maintained a studio in Paris until the early 1880s and often visited Picardy. From 1883, Salmson usually spent the summers at Dalby in Sk√•ne. Upon returning to Sweden, he became a member of the Royal Academy and gave lessons to Prince Eugen, but later joined a group opposed to the Academy's teaching methods (Opponenterna). In addition to the Paris Salon, he participated in a number of the Academy's exhibitions in Stockholm in (1886‚Äì1888), the World Exhibition in (1878), the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris, the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 in Copenhagen, Forers exhibition at Charlottenborg Palace (1879), the Art Exhibition in Gothenburg (1881), as well as Swedish Association of Artists' Exhibitions at Stockholm and Gothenburg in (1886). During his last years, Salmson mainly painted portraits in oil or pastel.He was frequently reclusive, uncommunicative and suffered from depression. He died during 1894 while staying at a hotel in Lund.

The film was produced and written by Samira Mohsen and starred Ahmed Ezz, Nour, Khaled Selim, Dalia El Behairy, Hassan Hosny, Samira Mohsen, Osama Abbas, Moatazza Abdel Sabour, and Tamer Samir. It is available on digital platforms and available online. The plot is set in Hurghada, Egypt: two unemployed Egyptian university graduates, Ahmed and Khaled, resort to conning tourists in Hurghada. After meeting two girls, Dalia and Noor, with whom they fall in love, they decide to change their con ways, and work honestly in the tourism business.  Plot  There are two characters, Ahmed and Khaled, played by Ahmed Ezz and Khaled Selim. They're best friends and went to the same university together. They later also graduate from the university together. After graduation they found it very hard to find work. They stayed unemployed for a very long time. After thinking together for a very long time and trying to figure out a way to make money they came up with an idea. This idea was to become con artists. The movie starts by them conning people into leaving down payments for buying apartments when in reality they're just taking they're money and running away. When they get caught and run away they decided to con older ladies in Hurghada. Hurghada is a touristic place in Egypt that is about a 6-hour drive away from cairo. Their plan was to makeout with girls in Hurghada and take from them or steal from money. They kept doing this as their way to get money and it actually worked. At one point in the movie Khaled complains to Ahmed that he is against the way they're living right now and that he feels bad about working hard and graduating from university and ending up as con artists. Eventually they meet two girls, Nour and Dalia played by the Egyptian actresses Nour and Dalia Behery. After meeting these two girls the two guys realize that they're very attracted to them. They have a conversation and begin to get to know each other more. When Nour and Dalia asked Ahmed and Khaled what do they work as, the guys said that they are businessmen. These two girls were cousins. Their uncle, whose name is Hassan, was a very popular businessman. This is where the girls decided that they'll let these two guys work with their uncle and do business together. Later the guys met Hassan and decided on a business plan to open a restaurant. In the process of doing this business Ahmed fell in love with nour while Khaled fell in love with Dalia. Nour and Dalia's friend, Kooky later builds this crazy jealousy towards their relationships. She decided to call Nour's father and tell her about her love story with Ahmed. Nour's father is a very important businessman and later surprises his daughter for a visit. He later tells Nour that he searched these guy's names and knows that they're con artists. The father tried to explain to Nour that the business these guys claim to do is a lie and that they took their money but will not do any business with it. After that Ahmed meets Nour's dad and before talking with him Nour's dad attacks him with his facts and tells Ahmed that he knows that him and his friend are thieves. Later the police surprises Ahmed and Khaled while they're with Dalia and Nour and lock them up. Nour and Dalia find out everything after the police arrests them. While Nour seems a little understanding to why they might have decided to steal the money Dalia shows that she's completely against it. After Ahmed and Khaled get out of jail Nour goes and visits Ahmed and tells him how much she's in love with him regardless of everything that happened. For a while Ahmed holds back and tells her that she deserves better and doesn't see her. However Nour doesn't stop trying until she convinces him that they deserve to be together. In the meantime Khaled tries to get Dalia back and after trying a lot he eventually succeeds. The movie ends by opening the restaurant they wanted to open in the beginning and the two couples end up together.

It is native to the Amazon basin where it occurs in Venezuela, Colombia and northern Brazil. It was first described in 1905 by the German botanist Ernst Heinrich Georg Ule. It is the only member of the genus to be included in the subgenus Microphyllae. Description H. microphylla is a small tree up to tall, with a small, sparse crown and a slender trunk with a swollen, bottle-like base. It bears \\"winter shoots\\", stubby side shoots with short internodes, scale leaves on the stem and larger leaves near the tip. These poorly-developed shoots are short-lived, the foliage being shed before new shoots develop; this species shares this feature with H. benthamiana and H. brasiliensis, the remaining trees in the genus being evergreen. The leaves have three leaflets which are bent back in the bud and are later held in a horizontal or deflexed position. The inflorescence develops in a leaf axle and consists of separate male and female flowers with five perianth lobes, with the female flowers near the panicle tip. These female flowers have a swollen torus at the base and are the largest in the genus. The fruit is a capsule with three large seeds, each measuring around . It is yellow with green stripes and a red tip when ripe. In H. microphylla, in contrast to other members of the genus, this capsule has thin, leathery valves and does not burst open when ripe to expel the seeds. Distribution and habitat H. microphylla is an uncommon species endemic to the upper and middle reaches of the Rio Negro, a left-bank tributary of the Amazon River. It mostly grows on river banks or islands and the sandy or laterite soils it favours are heavily inundated by flood water for at least four months each year. Uses H. microphylla is not exploited in the wild, probably because of the poor quality of the latex which is mixed with resins, and it is not cultivated.

Denmark (1989), was a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights ruling against Barfod in his accusation that the Danish government was not protecting his freedom of expression when writing an article suggesting that the judges who ruled in a specific case were incompetent to make fair and just decisions. The defendant was convicted on the basis that he wrote in the publication ‚ÄúGr√∏nland Dansk‚Äù that two of the judges who, were deciding in a case regarding taxation of Danish nationals working on a base in Greenland,\\"Barfod v. Denmark.\\" HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. were biased in deciding the case. Mr. Barfod wrote, ‚ÄúMost of the Local Government‚Äôs members could ... afford the time to watch that the two Greenland lay judges - who are by the way both employed directly by the Local Government, as director of a museum and as consultant in urban housing affairs - did their duty, and this they did. The vote was two to one in favor of the Local Government and with such a bench of judges it does not require much imagination to guess who voted how.\\"\\"Barfod v. Denmark.\\" HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. This accusation was seen as a potential for damage to their reputation therefore ‚Äúthe applicant was subsequently charged with defamation of character within the meaning of Article 71(1) of the Greenland Penal Code before the District Court of Narssaq‚Äù\\"Barfod v. Denmark.\\" HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. This case was then appealed and brought to the High Court for Eastern Denmark to then eventually be brought before the High Court of Greenland as it more formally fit the case. They once again did not side with Mr. Barfod. On October 16, 1987 the case was brought to the European Court of Human Rights. In a 6 to 1 decision the court found that there was no violation to Mr. Barfod‚Äôs right to freedom of speech. Background In 1979 the local government in Greenland decided to tax Danish citizens who were employed on an American base in Greenland. This created much pushback from people who were affected by this taxation as they felt ‚Äúthat the decision was illegal on the grounds, inter alia, that they did not have the right to vote in local elections in Greenland and did not receive any benefits from the Greenland authorities‚Äù.\\"Barfod v. Denmark.\\" HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. Three judges heard the case and, ‚Äúin its judgment of 28 January 1981‚Ä¶ the High Court unanimously found for the Local Government; this judgment was subsequently upheld by the High Court for Eastern Denmark on 8 September 1983‚Äù.\\"Barfod v. Denmark.\\" HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. After this decision was made, Mr. Barfod wrote an opinion piece in ‚ÄòGr√∏nland Dansk‚Äô criticizing the judge‚Äôs rulings. He stated that, \\"most of the Local Government‚Äôs members could ... afford the time to watch that the two Greenland lay judges - who are by the way both employed directly by the Local Government, as director of a museum and as consultant in urban housing affairs - did their duty, and this they did. The vote was two to one in favor of the Local Government and with such a bench of judges it does not require much imagination to guess who voted how.\\"\\"Barfod v. Denmark.\\" HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. After his words were published, he was charged with defamation of character. On December 9, 1983, the hearings for the case started and this is where Mr. Barfod confirmed that he in fact made these remarks. The court convicted him and charged him 2000 Danish Kroner. This is where Mr. Barfod appealed his case to the High Court for Eastern Denmark, when was then turned over to the High Court of Greenland. The decision was upheld as it states here in the Greenland Penal Code. By these statues Mr. Barfod was not having his freedom of speech right be taken away, because he violated the Greenland Penal Code. He then brought this case to the European Court of Human Rights, as he believed his freedom of speech was not being protected by the decision made in the courts. Judgement =Majority Opinion= In the final decision the court, concluded with a 6 to 1 vote stating, \\"there was no violation of Article 10\\".Barfod v. Denmark. HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. This case was heard by judges, Mr. J. Cremona, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr. F. G√∂lc√ºkl√º, Mr. F. Matscher, Mr. B. Walsh and Mr. B. Gomard in the city of Strasbourg and a decision was made in February 1989. It was stated in the case, \\"The Court cannot accept this argument. The lay judges exercised judicial functions. The impugned statement was not a criticism of the reasoning in the judgment of 28 January 1981, but rather, as found by the High Court in its judgment of 3 July 1984, a defamatory accusation against the lay judges personally, which was likely to lower them in public esteem and was put forward without any supporting evidence (see paragraph 13 above). In view of these considerations, the political context in which the tax case was fought cannot be regarded as relevant for the question of proportionality\\".Barfod v. Denmark. HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web. Due to the fact that Mr. Barfod allegedly attacked the judges' personally, which could ruin their reputation and call into question their credibility, he was charged with the crime. =Dissenting Opinion= Judge G√∂lc√ºkl√º dissented on this case. His reasoning for disagreeing with the decision states, He agrees with Mr. Barfod in the fact that the judges might have had motivation for the decision they made regarding the initial taxation case when he says, \\"Although these two lay judges were not strictly speaking politicians, I consider that this case has political overtones inasmuch as it involved criticism of a specific judicial system, namely the Greenland judiciary and its composition, which, in the applicant‚Äôs view, did not inspire public confidence\\".\\"Barfod v. Denmark.\\" HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web In his dissent he cites Article 62 of the Danish Constitution which states, \\"Den d√∏mmende magts ud√∏velse kan kun ordnes ved lov. S√¶rdomstole med d√∏mmende myndighed kan ikke neds√¶ttes\\" (This translates to, the administration of justice shall remain separated from the Executive and the rules in this respect shall be laid down by lawBarfod v. Denmark. HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights. N.p., 22 Feb. 1989. Web). He also speaks upon the fact that what Mr. Barfod has said, is more aggressive, but similar to what the courts have admits to happening with these judges and how they probably should have stepped down as he stated, He disagrees with the notion that Mr. Barfod caused defamation of character because in his opinion he thought Mr. Barfod was not attacking them in their ability to judge but instead just in this particular decision. Media/Criticism In an article on lawteacher.net it was said, \\"The case of Barfod v Denmark does show that the court may provide a lesser level of protection to the press\\". This is just one example of how the court protected the judges and not the freedom on speech, which is supposed to be protected under Article 10. This was an article on human rights law in European courts. In the book Political Libels: A Comparative Study, it states, \\"The ECtHR took a markedly less protective attitude towards freedom of 'political' expression in Barfod v. Denmark... The ECtHR's judgment was brief and not clearly reasoned\\".Loveland, Ian. Political Libels: A Comparative Study. Oxford: Hart, 2000. Web. There was again criticism to this case with the judgement that was given and the reasoning as to why his freedom of speech was taken away. Comparative Cases The decision in the case of Barfod v. Denmark had a similar outcome to that of the US case Murphy v. Boston Herald. In Murphy v. Boston Herald it dealt with alleged defamation to a judge, which also happened in the Barfod case. In the US case, it was ruled in favor of Murphy, the judge, as stated, \\"The jury's verdict in this case reflects their conclusion that Wedge and the Herald defamed the plaintiff, and that they did so with actual malice and an awareness that they were enabling a campaign by the district attorney for the Bristol district to discredit the plaintiff by attacking the core attributes a judge must possess ‚Äî even temperament, lack of any bias, fairness at all times, and a particular sensitivity to the plight of victims of crimes\\". Similarly to the Barfod case the judges sided with the judges who were allegedly defamed over the freedom of speech and expression.

Franks, 573 U.S. _ (2014), is a U.S. Supreme Court case involving public employee's freedom of speech rights. Edward Lane sued Steve Franks for unfairly firing him, out of retaliation for sworn testimony Lane gave during a federal fraud case. The 11th circuit court originally ruled in favor of Franks, ‚Äúdenying [Lane] first amendment protection to subpoenaed testimony‚Äù (Page 6, section I). The case was argued before the Supreme Court on April 28, 2014. The case was decided on June 19, 2014. The Supreme Court sided with Lane that he was not responsible for something he said during a federal trial. However, the court could not award damages, because Frank's qualified immunity protected him from being sued in his personal capacity. The case is an important vote of confidence from the Supreme Court about governmental employees not being held responsible for speech that is made as a public citizen on a matter of public concern. It is in line with the Pickering v. Board of Education ruling of 1968 (Opinion para. 1).. https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-483_9o6b.pdf  Background of the Case  Edward Lane accepted a role at Central Alabama Community College (CACC) in 2006, as the director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY). Lane proceeded to terminate Suzanne Schmitz. Schmitz was a state representative and on the programs payroll, despite not performing any duties. Lane was then subpoenaed to testify ‚Äúregarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz‚Äù in two federal trials for fraud (Section 1, para. 5). In 2009 after the conclusion of the trials Steve Franks, the CACC president, terminated 29 employees. Lane was among the employees that got termination letters. Franks rescinded 27 of the 29 terminations, but two, including Lane's were not rescinded. Lane then sued Franks in \\"federal district court and alleged that his termination from the CITY program was in retaliation for his testimony against Schmitz and therefore violated his First Amendment right to free speech. Lane sued Franks in his official and private capacities as the president of CACC.  Lower Courts Ruling  The Federal District Court in northern Alabama ruled on behalf of Franks. Citing that because Lane learned of the information on the job he was not protected as a citizen on a matter of public concern. They also ruled that Franks was protected because he had qualified immunity. The 11th circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court‚Äôs decision.  Supreme Courts' Ruling  ‚ÄúThe critical question is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee‚Äôs duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties. Corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds involve matter of significant public concern; the form and context of the speech, sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding, fortify that conclusion‚Äù (Summary). In a unanimous decision on behalf of Franks, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part, for further judicial ruling (Section 5, para. 2). The court said that Lane's speech was protected under the first amendment. However, \\"previous precedent, specifically Morris v. Crow, had held that public employee testimony was unprotected speech, and thus when Franks fired Lane, he was not violating a clearly established constitutional right\\" (Para. 4). Since that is the case Franks was entitled to qualified immunity, so the Supreme Court affirmed the 11th circuit court's ruling about ‚Äúclaims against Franks in his individual capacity‚Äù (Section 5). The court remanded the case for further proceedings dealing with Frank's defense of sovereign immunity in his official capacities. This ruling does chip away at the precedent set by the Supreme Courts ruling in Garcetti v. Ceballos, just eight years earlier.  Amicus Briefs Filed  Multiple amicus briefs were filed, mostly on the part of Lane. Nine briefs were filed in support of Lane, while one was filed in support of Franks. One was filed by the American government on a neutral ground, both advocating for affirming and reversing part of the 11th circuit court's decision. Among the most notable organizations to file briefs in support of Lane were the ACLU, Alliance Defending Freedom, and National Whistle Blowers Center. All three of these amicus briefs, point out the importance of protecting employee speech made in the context of a federal trial. With the ACLU saying ‚Äú[a]t a minimum, the State of Alabama certainly had no interest in preventing Edward Lane from complying with a subpoena issued by the United States and providing truthful testimony about public corruption in a federal criminal trial‚Äù (Page 29).  Media Coverage  Multiple media outlets covered the case when it first broke. Those included NPR, The Washington Post, and the New York Times. All of these media outlets applauded the Supreme Court for protecting the public employee's freedom of speech rights, while also noting the hurdle Lane faced in actually winning damages. With the New York Times writing \\"[w]hile Mr. Lane established an important legal principle, he will not benefit from it. In the second part of her opinion, Justice Sotomayor wrote that Mr. Franks, the official who fired him, was protected by qualified immunity\\" (Para. 16). There was even a law review done by Thomas A. Schweitzer, of Touro College. The review really sums up the idea that all the decision really did was show the convoluted nature that the courts now have to consider because of previous precedent set in multiple cases, including the Garcetti case. Schweitzer does agree with the court's decision of protecting Mr. Lane's freedom of speech rights. Edward Lane has written a book about his Supreme Court victory in Whistleblower: Having Ethics Regardless of the Outcome.  Subsequent Developments  With the court being decided so recently, there has not been much subsequent opinions on the matter of governmental employee speech. The case has not been referenced directly in any subsequent court cases, at any level. The most recent development comes from Heffernan v. City of Paterson, decided in April 2016, which dealt with a similar issue. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Heffernan who had been fired because he supported a certain candidate that was running for mayor. Justice Breyer said ‚ÄúThe Constitution prohibits a government employer from discharging or demoting an employee because the employee supports a particular political candidate‚Äù (Section 2, para. 1)..

Research Pettit's research focuses on various aspects of social inequality. For instance, in her 2012 book Invisible Men: Mass Incarceration and the Myth of Black Progress, she argues that mass incarceration in the United States has distorted our perception of racial equality because government surveys tend to undercount prisoners. When, in this book, she added prisoners to these surveys, she found that the status of black Americans has not significantly improved since the 1960s. She has also studied the effects of incarceration on families and racial inequality. With Bruce Western, she has also studied other social consequences of incarceration, such as decreased earnings for former prisoners.

W. Bressler-Pettis Eagle at top of the monument The Monument of States was conceived as a symbol of American unity after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is located at 300 E. Monument Avenue in Kissimmee, Florida. It was built by volunteers, with donations of stone that came from around the world, including a rock from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was the brainchild of Charles W. Bressler- Pettis, who also hoped it would become a unique tourist attraction for the city. Conception and design When the United States came under attack from the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941, Charles W. Bressler-Pettis was a retired physician living in Florida, and was president of the Kissimmee All- States Tourist club that catered to senior citizens. He had served in both the Royal Army Medical Corps and the United States Army during World War I. Pettis devised an idea to erect a unique monument in Kissimmee that he hoped would inspire American solidarity in response to the attack. As a promoter of local tourism, Pettis was also looking to draw visitors to Kissimmee with a unique attraction. He enlisted his friend J. C. Fisher to work with him on designing a monument that would contain a rock from each state. The result of Pettis's collaboration with Fisher was a step-pyramid weighing an estimated 100,000 pounds and reinforced with 3 ¬Ω tons of steel rails. At the top sits an American eagle and a flag of the United States, resting on a blue concrete orb. Speculation has been offered by the National Park Service and others that it is possible Pettis might have been influenced by the Fireplace of States in Bemidji, Minnesota. Built by the Works Progress Administration in 1934‚Äì35, the Bemidji fireplace was constructed with stones from each of the then 48 states (Alaska and Hawaii were considered territories at the time of the monument's construction and world not become states until 1959 and 1960 respectively). Construction The Florida monument was built entirely through volunteer labor, mostly the senior citizens of the travel club. Governors of each state received letters from Pettis asking for rock donations to build the monument. Local government and civic organizations, as well as area businesses and individual residents, donated time and materials, including 507 donations of one bag of cement each. Those in Kissimmee who contributed in any manner have their names inscribed on the adjacent sidewalk. Pettis had amassed a collection of thousands of rocks in his travels and donated many of them to the project. President Franklin D. Roosevelt donated a rock from his estate in New York. By the time of its 1943 completion and dedication by Florida's United States Senator Claude Pepper, it was composed of 1,500 stones and objects donated from all over the world. When Pettis died in 1954, Kissimmee changed its regulations on burials to permit a portion of his remains to be sealed inside the work. A plaque honoring Pettis was placed on the monument. Restoration and NRHP As tourism was drawn away by the 1971 opening of Walt Disney World in Orlando, the Kissimmee monument fell into neglect and disrepair. On March 28, 1993, the city of Kissimmee had a re-dedication of the monument and sealed a time capsule within it. The American Automobile Association stepped in to help restore it in 2001. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 8, 2015.

Above is a schematic representing different configurations which polymer molecules (such as alkylammonium cations) can adopt when adsorbed between clay layers, in response to the magnitude of charge density on the clay surface. Greater charge densities here result in righter packing and greater clay- clay distances. Polymer soil stabilization refers to the addition of polymers to improve the physical properties of soils, most often for geotechnical engineering, construction, or agricultural projects. Even at very small concentrations within soils, various polymers have been shown to increase water retention and reduce erosion, increase soil shear strength, and support soil structure. A wide range of polymers have been used to address problems ranging from the prevention of desertification to the reinforcement of roadbeds. Polymers that have been tested for soil stabilization effects include a range of synthetic polymers and biopolymers. Biopolymers in particular offer a more eco-friendly alternative to traditional chemical additives, such as ordinary cement, which may generate a large amount of carbon dioxide during production or cause lasting environmental damage. Polymers mainly affect the aggregation and strength of soils through their interactions with fine clay particles. Coatings of adsorbed polymers on clays can increase their steric stabilization by preventing clay particles from approaching each other as closely. Alternatively, polymer molecules that bond with multiple clay particles promote flocculation. Hydrogel networks can result in more indirect strengthening within soils by creating a scaffolding for soil particles. Additional strength can be imparted to polymer networks within soils through chemical cross-linking and curing.  Overview  Synthetic polymers began replacing other chemical binders for soil stabilization in agriculture in the late 20th century. Compared to traditional chemical binders, polymer soil additives can achieve the same amount of strengthening at much lower concentrations ‚Äì for example, mixtures of 0.5-1% of various biopolymers have strength levels that match or exceed those of 10% cement mixtures in soils. Synthetic polymers, including geopolymers, and biopolymers have been tested for their beneficial interactions with soils. Methods for introducing polymers into soils include mixing, injection, spraying, and grouting. Liquid polymers, sold as concentrated solutions, can be applied deep within the soil through pressure injection or applied directly to uncompacted soil. = Synthetic polymers = Alumino-silicate based, synthetic geopolymers provide many of the same binding properties as Portland cement. Compared to other polymer additives, many geopolymers are quite durable, with high mechanical strength and thermal stability. They react readily with calcium hydroxide in water, which allows them to act as cementitious binders. Geopolymers offer the advantage of being more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient to produce than traditional chemical additives, and can be synthesized from waste products such as mine tailings or fly ash. When these waste products are treated with an alkaline reagent, the aluminosilicate rapidly depolymerizes and polycondenses into a rigid three dimensional polymeric structure that coats and strengthens soil pores. Geopolymers have been applied to stabilize gypseous soils because of their resistance to sulfur and other chemical attacks, which weaken traditional cement.left = Biopolymers = Biopolymers are synthesized as a result of biological processes, and are often less harmful to the landscape and its biota because of their natural origins. Of the three types of biopolymers, polysaccharidess have proven more useful as soil binders than polynucleotides or polypeptides. Biopolymers that have been tested for use in soil stabilization include cellulose, starch, chitosan, xanthan, curdlan, and beta-glucan. Some biopolymers are sensitive to water, and wetter soils exhibit weaker biopolymer-clay cohesion. Because of this, when wetted, gel-type biopolymers form hydrogels which have decreased tensile strength but significantly higher compressive strength compared to the original soil. Protein-based biopolymers, though less common, have been used as an alternative to polysaccharides for projects requiring greater water resistance. Biopolymers may increasingly replace synthetic polymers for soil stabilization projects. They are more environmentally friendly than many other chemical soil additives, and can achieve the same amount of strengthening at much lower concentrations. Increasing use of biopolymers could offset the carbon dioxide emissions associated with cement production, which can be as high as 1.25 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cement.  Polymer-soil chemistry  Polymer treatments modify the size, shape, and cohesion of soil aggregates by changing the interactions between soil particles. Because polymer-soil interactions occur on the surfaces of soil particles, the amount of surface area in the soil (in other words, its dominant particle size) is of great importance. Polymers have only weak interactions with the large sand- and silt-sized particles of soil, while they bond directly to finer clays. Although polymers mainly interact with the clay fraction of soils, they do change the properties of sandy soils to a lesser degree. Polymer structure dictates how they will interact with clay particles. For example, block copolymers result in very different soil properties than homopolymers, as do ionic and nonionic polymers. Additionally, the mechanisms by which different polymers adsorb onto clay particle surfaces result in different soil properties and responses. = Steric stabilization = Polymers on the surfaces of the colloidal fraction of soils promote steric stabilization of those particles by preventing them from approaching each other and aggregating. This effect is seen in a variety of aqueous and nonaqueous environments, and is not affected by electrolytes in solution. The degree of steric stabilization depends on the amount of clay surface covered by adsorbed polymers, the strength of the polymer bond, the thickness of the polymer layer, and the favorability of the solvent for the polymer loops and tails. Block and graft copolymers, made up of two different homopolymers with differing solubilities in the suspension medium, are most often used for steric stabilization. When synthesized to have alternating regions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, copolymers can stabilize the suspension because their hydrophobic group adsorbs strongly to the colloid surface while the hydrophilic group is attracted to the solvent. In general, the adsorption of polymers to clay surfaces is entropically favored because one polymer molecule displaces many water molecules which were previously bound to the soil particle. Polymer and clay particle suspensions have been used to understand the mechanism of this steric stabilization in soils. Consider a homopolymer adsorbed to the surfaces of clay particles in suspension. As the clay particles approach each other to within two times the thickness of the polymer layers, the loops and tails of the polymers on one surface will start to block those on the other surface, leading to a decrease in configurational entropy. This is unfavorable because it increases the Gibbs free energy of the system, and it will be more energetically favorable for the colloid particles to remain farther apart.The morphology of polymer-clay aggregates is dictated by the entropic and enthalpic contributions to the energy of their interactions. Three possible morphologies depicted above include (1) intercalated, in which polymer molecules alternate with clay layers, (2) flocculated, in which the alternating clay/polymer layers begin to aggregate, and (3) exfoliated, in which a polymer matrix supports individual, separated clay layers.Overall, the free energy of steric interactions (ŒîGs) can be expressed as a function of both elastic repulsive energy (ŒîGel) and the free energy of mixing (ŒîGmix): ŒîGs = ŒîGel \\\\+ ŒîGmix The elastic repulsive energy (ŒîGel), increases as more polymers adsorb to the surfaces of clay particles. This can be modeled as: ŒîGel = 2kBTŒìln(Œ©(h)/Œ©(‚àû)) where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, Œì is the number of adsorbed polymers per unit surface area, and Œ©(h) and Œ©(‚àû) are the number of available conformations at h and infinite distances. ŒîGs due to steric interactions is also a function of the free energy of mixing (ŒîGmix). Most commonly, this will favor greater distances between polymer molecules in solution. = Flocculation = Alternatively, under different conditions, polymers can enhance flocculation. Particle aggregates are held together more strongly by polymers than by electrolytes. Such interactions are called bridging flocculation because a single polymer chain is linked to multiple soil particles. Examples of common bridging polymers include polyacrylamide (PAM) and polyethylene oxide. In one study, PAM was found to increase the size of kaolinite flocs in suspension experiments from 10 Œºm to several millimeters. The maximum strength benefits of flocculation are achieved when polymers cover a surface area equivalent to half the polymer saturation capacity. Addition of polymer beyond this point causes the polymer to act as a lubricant, allowing the soil particles to slip across each other.leftBiopolymers have been shown to strengthen soils both by cohesion with clay particles to form polymer-clay matrices and by promoting the aggregation of coarser soil particles with each other within the polymer- clay matrix. The hydroxyl groups on polysaccharide biopolymers allow them to form hydrogen bonds directly with charged clay particles (in dry soils), as well as with soil pore water itself (in moist soil). These interactions are promoted by the high surface area of both the biopolymers themselves and the clay particles they bond with. When ionized polymers (such as many biopolymers) with the same charge as clay particles adsorb to their surface, they increase the electrical double layer repulsion. = Cross-linking and curing = The strength of polymer chains can be enhanced by cross-linking, which increases the interactions between chains through bonding with another reactant. The high mechanical strength of soil/polymer mixtures after cross- linking can make many polymers more suited for soil stabilization projects. Curing time after polymer addition can also affect the strength of the polymer-soil structures formed. After seven days of curing, the liquid polymer SS299 resulted in soil with two times the compressive strength of untreated soil. Some polymers can also acquire strength much more rapidly during curing than traditional, non-polymeric chemical additives.  Applications  The structure of polyacrylamide (PAM), a common synthetic polymer flocculating agent used to increase aggregate sizes in clay-rich soils. Soil characteristics that have been altered by addition of polymers include compressive strength, volume stability, hydraulic durability, and conductivity. Polymers can help prevent soil erosion and increase infiltration of water by strengthening soil aggregates and supporting soil structure. The properties of the soil itself are a dominant control on the ability of polymers to interact with it. A study of the cationic, alkaline polymer SS299 (a commercially produced additive) found that the properties of treated soils depend on the plasticity index of the original soil, which reflects its clay content. Hydrogel swelling of biopolymers reduces the amount of soil pore space, restricting the flow of water and suiting polymer hydrogels for construction projects seeking to minimize water seepage and support vegetation growth. Biopolymers can be added to soils along with synthetic polymers to utilize the properties of both polymers. By increasing the water retention and infiltration rates in soils, the addition of biopolymers increases the availability of water for plants. This is particularly applicable in arid regions like deserts where droughts leave soils susceptible to high rates of erosion during precipitation events. By retaining water, the enhanced soils reduce runoff and its accompanying erosion. PAM has been widely applied as a soil stabilizer for agriculture, both to retain water in fields and to improve run-off water quality by reducing the amount of sediment entering rivers and streams.

Depicting Francis I of France on a destrier horse, it is estimated to have been cast from a clay or wax model in the first half of the 16th century. The sculpture is in the permanent exhibit of the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts.  Description  The bronze statuette consists of the horse and a detachable rider. It has an applied green patina on top of black paint patina, typical of Renaissance works. Both parts are hollow, and attached together are 24 cm high, 15 cm wide, and 28 cm long ( by by ), and weigh . The parts were cast separately, including the horse's rump and tail section that was used to extract the core, but nevertheless at the same time. There is minimal trace of finishing on the statuette; many of the holes and casting flaws on both the horse and the rider have not been chiseled off or filled, which suggests an intent of preserving a model rather than making a final cast. The rider is wearing a Greek-style helmet with its visor tipped up, encircled by a crown, with a serpent-tailed dragon on the back. He is holding a shield in his left hand, and originally had a sword or a lance in his right hand, but only the hilt is now left. Similar horses and riders, some in exactly the same position, are depicted in many of Leonardo's studies of horses owned by the Milanese nobleman Gal√©as de Saint-S√©verin. The depiction of the rider is less defined than the horse or Leonardo's other works. Hungarian art historian M√°ria Aggh√°zy noticed a resemblance between the content-looking rider and the young Francis I of France, soon to be king, and Leonardo's patron from his later years. Francis was an avid participant in jousting tournaments, which in the more entertaining but also more dangerous French style were run with less armour and other equipment than in Italy. Aggh√°zy theorised that the rider's light clothing, likely after a victorious duel, demonstrated bravery on Francis's part as he followed the chivalrous ideals of the Nine Worthies.  History  Young Francis I by Jean Clouet c.1515 In 1516, after invitations from King Francis I of France and his predecessor, Louis XII of France, Leonardo moved to France and entered the service of Francis I. Art chronicler Gian Paolo Lomazzo, close to Leonardo's heirs, wrote in 1584 that Leonardo had made several models of horses for Francis. This statuette is believed to be one of them. Towards the end of his life, Leonardo was working on several equestrian monuments, and did several studies of horses on worksheets that have been preserved in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle. This statuette was depicted in sketches from c.1490 Retrieved 28 March 2017. Cited in Aggh√°zy 1989. and c.1517‚Äì1518 Retrieved 28 March 2017. Cited in Aggh√°zy 1989. Retrieved 28 March 2017. Cited in Clark & Pedretti 1968. with and without the rider. By then Leonardo was unable to continue with artwork much beyond sketches, but did for instance supervise bronze casting of statues at the king's Palace of Fontainebleau. By 1540, Leonardo's follower Leone Leoni was also commissioned to create an equestrian statuette while he was a court sculptor to Charles V, who governed Milan at the time. In 1549 and 1550, Leoni sent several letters to Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle requesting that Leonardo's statuette from the king's court be sent back to him. An equestrian bronze model was recorded in the Leoni collection at their home Casa degli Omenoni before the collection was dispersed by 1620. The outline of the statuette also features in a c.1545 scrollwork from the Fontainebleau workshops of Francis I. The scrollwork has a detailed design for the decoration of a horse's chanfron head armour to be used in jousting.Stored in the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung M√ºnchen. 14.703.

During his stay in Rome, Ferenczy gathered a collection of 82 works of art, including this statuette, which he had acquired in the mistaken belief that it was a Greek work. In 1846 he prepared an inventory with the intention of selling the collection to the Hungarian state, still with the statuette as an ancient work from Athens, but the sale did not go through. As Ferenczy's will stated that the crates of his collection were not to be opened for 50 years, the collection remained untouched for a long time after his death in 1856. The family reached a deal with the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest and sold the collection to them in 1914, still none the wiser about the statuette. After discovering its provenance, the heirs sued the museum for a misleading sale and poor payments during the aftermath of World War I. Simon Meller, the curator of the Budapest museum, began exploring the statuette with more knowledge of Leonardo's equestrian works. He came to the conclusion that the style of the statuette is consistent with Leonardo's other works, particularly those in the studies for the painting of The Battle of Anghiari and the Trivulzio monument. He attributed the statuette to Leonardo da Vinci for the first time since the 17th century, and published it in a 1916 journal of the museums in the Prussian region. To mark the occasion, another sculptor in the Ferenczy family, B√©ni Ferenczy, gifted Meller a commemorative medal with a relief of the statuette. The statuette became a permanent exhibit in the museum in the 1920s. The 1940s were a tumultuous time for Europe's artworks, with the statuette, the Holy Crown of Hungary, and many other works of art captured in the Nazi plunder. During World War II, Hungary joined the Axis powers in 1940. In September 1942, Russia unexpectedly bombed Budapest. The museum began the protection of their works of art by packing them into crates and moving them to lower floors. Considered one of the most precious works in the museum's collection, the statuette and the works of Old Masters were taken further west from the Eastern Front to Veszpr√©m in early 1943. Once Hungary started attempts to reach peace with the Allies, Germany invaded the country in March 1944. The Museum of Fine Arts was under the control of the Ministry of Education, where the newly installed Ferenc Rajniss, sympathetic to the Nazi rule, ordered the majority of the museum's artwork to be sent to Austria. The director of the museum had no trace of their whereabouts. In late 1944, the Red Army captured Budapest in the Budapest Offensive, and damaged or destroyed a large part of the buildings in the city. The Museum of Fine Arts building suffered damage to its roof, ruining the halls on the top floor, which prior to its evacuation housed the collection with the statuette. Some of the remaining artwork was smashed or burned by the Soviets. The museum did not hear of the evacuated art again until after the end of the war. In August 1945, they were contacted by the \\"Monuments Men\\" working in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program in Munich. They had been cataloging art looted by the Nazis, and at the Munich Central Collecting Point had works of art from the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts. The statuette, along with most of the other artwork, was returned to the museum by 1947. The statuette was exhibited in London in 1930. More recently, it was in New York, Washington and Atlanta in 2009, and in Los Angeles in 2010. During the renovation of the Budapest museum until 2018, it has been on another tour: Paris and Mantova, Italy in 2016,, Madrid in 2017, and Buenos Aires in 2018.  Attribution  Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest The statuette was attributed to Leonardo in 1916 by Simon Meller, the curator at the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts, due to its similarities to Leonardo's drawings. M√°ria Aggh√°zy summarised the attribution in the 1970s and 80s beyond the comparisons to Leonardo's drawings, by saying that the rider's composure matches the reported personality of the young to- be-king Francis I of France, that there is no armour or saddle as is suitable for French jousting, that the figure is wearing a royal-style crown ornament, and that the statuette was depicted in later French artwork for jousting. The attribution has been widely accepted, more seriously than other sculpture attributions to Leonardo, and according to art historian Martin Kemp, is well supported. There is, however, some doubt, especially on the rider. In the 1920s, following Meller's attribution, a dozen art scholars published their opinions about the statuette. Half of them, including Edmund Hildebrandt, agreed with Meller's attribution, and the rest thought it was a later work by one of Leonardo's pupils. L.H. Heydenreich wrote in 1954 that the statuette proves Leonardo's competency for casting in bronze. In more recent publications, Martin Kemp noted the unusual lack of attention to detail on the horse's anatomy, which others have echoed due to the extreme bending of the horse's hind legs and a perceived lack of energy typical to Leonardo's other works. The quality of the surface modelling suggests that the bronze cast may have been made by one of Leonardo's pupils from a wax model of his, as in one of Leonardo's worksheets he had made a note to himself to \\"make a little one of wax about four inches long\\" next to horse sketches. Retrieved 28 March 2017. Kenneth Clark, Martin Kemp, and Carlo Pedretti all suggested that the note refers to the Budapest statue. Some believe the statuette is merely based on one of Leonardo's sketches. Giovanni Francesco Rustici has also been considered as the sculptor. via Aggh√°zy 1989 p. 58. Technical evidence from a 2009 investigation organised by the National Gallery of Art suggests that the statuette was cast near or after Leonardo's death in 1519 using the lost wax technique. The composition of the metal alloy is identical in all the parts of the statuette, apart from the modern pin used to attach the rider. Reverse side of the statuette NGA exhibition in 2009, left-to-right: Limerick horse, Budapest horse, New York horse, and the Mounted Warrior in the foreground Equestrian statuettes with only slight variations to the Rearing Horse and Mounted Warrior have been discovered over the years. They are often referred to by their location. Particularly the Rearing Horse at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and in the Hunt Museum in Limerick, Ireland, have been considered as being by an early follower of Leonardo, such as Leone Leoni. The three were exhibited for the 1969 Congress of the Comit√© International d'Histoire de l'Art as \\"Horses of Leonardo da Vinci\\" with reservation on their attribution. For repeat exhibitions in the US in 2009‚Äì2010, the National Gallery of Art investigation confirmed the New York and Limerick horses to be the result of techniques and alloys available only since the 19th century. Another horse, a mirror image of the New York statuette with the horse facing left, was in London in the collection of art critic Pierre Jeannerat (d. 1983). The London statuette was exhibited in 1961‚Äì62 in London, Amsterdam and Florence as Leonardo's, but has since been attributed to sculptors after the 17th century artist Jan de Bisschop. A similar statuette in the Speed Art Museum in Kentucky was once associated with this group of statuettes, but has since been attributed to Rustici or Willem Danielsz van Tetrode. The provenance of the rider is disputed due to its size and lesser quality of work. Because the current attachment of the rider is modern, the horse lacks a saddle, and the rider is of smaller scale than the horse, the National Gallery of Art considered the possibility that the rider is a later addition. In their 2009 exhibit, the Rearing Horse was for the first time displayed separately from the Mounted Warrior, which was placed beside the horse. The Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, holds a horseman statuette that shares the crude features of the Budapest rider. Titled Warrior, it has been attributed to Leone Leoni or one of his followers, and may be based on the same model as the Mounted Warrior.

In her 60-year career, Shaw studied plant pathogens in Australia, Canada and Papua New Guinea. The fungal genus Shawiella has been named in her honour.  Biography  = Early life and education = Dorothy Shaw was born in Sydney to Sidney Shaw, a tinsmith, and Amy Shaw, n√©e Field. She studied at St George's Girls School and later The University of Sydney. While completing a Bachelor of Agricultural Science, Shaw investigated wheat diseases caused by the genus Septoria. Shaw received the Thomas Lawrance Pawlett Scholarship and travelled to Winnipeg, Manitoba where she was awarded her PhD by the University of Manitoba in 1955. Her thesis examined microconidia formation in Leptosphaeria avenaria.  Career  In almost 150 publications, Shaw documented her research on a broad range of topics such as mycology, plant pathology, fungal taxonomy, cytology and fungal spore collection by bees. As a sole author or co-author, Shaw named four new fungal genera and 14 new species. In 1955, Shaw was invited by the Papua New Guinea Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries to establish a Plant Pathology section. As a young scientist, Shaw faced a challenging task, with limited facilities, laboratory staff and equipment available. In addition, literature concerning endemic plant pathogens was almost 'non-existent' at the time. She continued to work in Papua New Guinea for over two decades, publishing an index of plant diseases in 1963 and one of her most influential publications, Microorganisms in Papua New Guinea in 1984. In recognition of her public service, Shaw was awarded an Independence Medal and MBE from the PNG Government. She was closely involved with the PNG Scout Association, receiving the Silver Acorn award in 1969 for her 'outstanding service'.

It is a large, black to metallic green dragonfly with bright yellow markings on its abdomen, clear wings and long legs. It is found in northern Australia, where it inhabits streams and pools. Taxonomic history Robin Tillyard collected the type specimen of Macromia tillyardi in 1905 and passed it onto Ren√© Martin for publication in his about-to-be- published work on Cordulines, in Collections zoologiques du baron Edm. de Selys Longchamps. Three females of this magnificent insect were taken by me at Kuranda, N.Q., in January, 1905. As M. Ren√© Martin is about to issue his work on the Corduliinae, it seems fitting that the record and description of so fine a species should appear in his new work. I have therefore sent him my description of the insect together with the type-specimen. It will be sufficient in this paper to give a short description only, so that the insect may be recognised by Australian collectors (Tillyard, 1906) Tillyard wrote his description and published it in November 1906, several months before Martin's work was published on 17 January 1907.

Doldrums began in 2010 as a moniker to release home recordings before expanding into a live band and releasing three LPs: Lesser Evil (2013) on Arbutus Records, The Air Conditioned Nightmare (2015) on Sub Pop records, and Esc (2017) on Endless.  History  Doldrums began in 2010 at The House of Everlasting Superjoy, a DIY venue and warehouse living space in Toronto that Airick shared with members of the group DD/MM/YYYY, which he cites as a primary influence, along with the numerous American noise artists that the venue hosted. The first release was a VHS of videos and music that had been chopped up and collaged together, choosing the name Doldrums after the book The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster, a childhood favourite of his. A cover of Portishead's \\"Chase the Tear\\" brought Doldrums attention after Portishead chose to include it as the B-side to the vinyl release, a charity release for Amnesty International on XL Recordings. Cult UK label No Pain in Pop released his EP Empire Sound that year, which consisted of material from the Parrot Talk VHS. In Montreal Airick collaborated with artists within the burgeoning electronic music scene centred around Arbutus Records, which Pitchfork described as a group whose \\"sounds may be disparate, but [are] united by their desire to tackle questions of identity from unique and exciting perspectives.\\" Montreal-based artist Grimes discovered Doldrums and invited him to move to Montreal in 2011. Her single \\"Oblivion\\" was inspired by Airick, and he was featured on her album Visions. The two embarked on a tour of DIY venues in America including Silent Barn in NYC, the Copy Cat in Baltimore, Secret Squirrel in Athens and the Magic Stick in Detroit. Doldrums' first LP Lesser Evil was released on Arbutus on February 25, 2013. The album was well received and the band toured extensively, supporting artists Crystal Castles and Purity Ring as well as playing headlining shows and festivals. Black Dice, another key early influence on Doldrums' music, remixed the single \\"She Is the Wave\\". The band played 11 shows at the SXSW music festival in Austin in 5 days. In 2015 Sub Pop Records announced the release of Doldrums' second album The Air Conditioned Nightmare, marking the band's departure from Arbutus. The group headlined tours in America and Europe and played OFF festival in Poland. Following a live performance on Boiler Room TV the band's van was broken into and laptop, passport and other equipment stolen, resulting in the cancellation of a European tour with the band HEALTH and forcing Airick to stay in Canada, a period which he described as a \\"wake up call\\", due to the things he was doing being \\"emotionally unsustainable\\".http://diymag.com/2015/01/21/doldrums-its-the-first-time-ive- had-a-formula In July 2017 the new album Esc appeared, along with the video and single \\"Runner Up\\".  Musical style  Doldrums' music has been described as occupying the middle ground between noise and pop, and as 'post-internet' as it makes use of a wide variety of styles and is created primarily by collaging samples together, with added live drumming and percussion. Woodhead's voice has been described as androgynous, or countertenor As a lyricist he has written about the changing relationship of humans to their machines and each other, weaving together psychedelic and surrealist imagery to create character narratives.https://www.subpop.com/artists/doldrums  Live  Live members of the live band have included Petra Glynt on drums, Steven Foster on drums, Kyle Jukka on samples, Guy Dallas on synth, and Airick's brother Daniel Woodhead (from the band Moon King) on drums. The live band is known for chaotic performances involving extended live-improvisation jams by the musicians and encouraging dancing, audience participation and crowd surfing. In October 2017 Glynt released the solo album This Trip.

His art often depicted the sea and the men who worked it, done in various mediums. These include gouache, drawing in charcoal and ink, lithography and screen printing. Lonergan studied art in Paris at Ecole des Beaux-Arts. and in New York City at the Art Students League. During his career he taught at Friends Seminary, Columbia Grammar School, and Greenwich House, all in New York City. In 1939 he published a handbook on gouache painting, Materials and Techniques of Gouache Painting. From 1939 to 1942 Lonergan was a supervisor of the easel division of the Federal Arts Project in New York. As part of the larger Works Progress Administration, The FAP funded a wide range of visual and plastic arts; the easel division was specifically assigned to paintings. It paid artists a weekly wage of about $25 dollars to produce pieces which were then displayed in public institutions. These institutions included schools, community centers, museums, hospitals, government offices, libraries, post offices, and prisons. Nationwide, over 85,000 paintings were created and distributed.O'Connor, Francis V., ed. \\"The New Deal Arts Projects\\", Smithsonian Institution Press (1972) Like many artists in the 1930s, Lonergan was active on the political Left. He exhibited with the International Workers Order and was a founder of the American Artists Congress in 1937. The Congress avowed: \\"We artists must act. Individually we are powerless. Through collective action we can defend our interests. We must ally ourselves with all groups engaged in the common struggle against war and fascism.\\" Along with Lonergan, notable artists such as Alexander Calder, Stuart Davis, and Isami Noguchi signed its founding document. Lonergan's work was published in New Masses and Direction, prominent left-wing journals of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1942 he took part in the National War Poster Competition. The competition was part of the United States' effort to raise support for the war against the Axis Powers. Of the thousands of posters submitted, Lonergan's was one of two hundred chosen for an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art from November 1942 to January 1943.https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/841/releases/MOMA_1942_0083_1942-11-21_421121-76.pdf During his life, Lonergan exhibited broadly. His work was shown at the Tucson Museum, Phillips Academy, Princeton University, the Whitney Museum, the Association of American Artists, the American Contemporary Art Gallery, the Dorothy Paris Gallery, and the Feragil Gallery.

He is a versatile painter who can use heavy colors and pastel shades with equal effectiveness, and is capable of producing vigorous movement and life at one time and the enormous calm and sweetness of death at another. He is a poet in color, a musician with many strings to play upon. Look at Circus Workers, Fisherman's Supper, and Ruins No.1 for example and you will see the different moods and impressions he can capture.\\" In In December 1935 American Magazine of Art reviewed an exhibit of his work and wrote: \\"John Lonergan is a young painter who stands completely on his own feet. His small picture Pertaining to Rockport, captures a brooding mood in nature without over playing the pictoral element. His Quarry Derricks is not only larger in size but also in feeling and execution. There is a stark, forbidding grandeur about those silent crane- hoists seen against the bulk of a quarry mountain, stretching their thin, steel fingers into an ominous sky.\\" Lonergan was married to children's book author Joy Lonergan.  Collections Lonergan's work is in the collections of several major American museums: * The National Gallery, in Washington, DC, has Net and Fisherman (1940) lithograph; Fishermen With Net (1940) screenprint; and Fisherman's Wharf (1942) screenprint. * The Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC, has Circus Workers, gouache on paper; Fishermen with Net, screenprint on paper; Girl with Flowers, gouache on paper; Gloucester Dock #2, lithograph on paper; Mining Town, gouache on paper. * The Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York City, has Gloucester Docks (1940) gouache and ink on paper; Fish Pier, Gloucester (1948) ink on paper; Depression (1930) wash, charcoal, and ink on paper. * The Butler Institute of American Art, in Youngstown, Ohio has Expectations.

He was part of the first group of 24 West Indian missionaries from Jamaica and Antigua who worked under the aegis of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society of Switzerland. Caribbean missionary activity in Africa fit into the broader \\"Atlantic Missionary Movement\\" of the diaspora between the 1780s and the 1920s. Shortly after his arrival in Ghana, the mission appointed Clerk as the first Deacon of the Christ Presbyterian Church, Akropong, founded by the first Basel missionary survivor on the Gold Coast, Andreas Riis in 1835, as the organisation's first Protestant church in the country. Alexander Clerk is widely acknowledged and regarded as one of the pioneers of the precursor to the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. A leader in education in colonial Ghana, he established an all-male boarding middle school, the Salem School at Osu in 1843. In 1848, Clerk was an inaugural faculty member at the Basel Mission Seminary, Akropong, now known as the Presbyterian College of Education, where he was an instructor in Biblical studies. The Basel missionaries founded the Akropong seminary and normal school to train teacher- catechists in service of the mission. The college is the second oldest higher educational institution in early modern West Africa after Fourah Bay College in Freetown, Sierra Leone which was established in 1827. Clerk was the father of Nicholas Timothy Clerk (1862 ‚Äì 1961), a Basel-trained theologian, who was elected the first Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1918 to 1932 and co-founded the all boys‚Äô boarding high school, the Presbyterian Boys‚Äô Secondary School established in 1938. A. W. Clerk was also the progenitor of the historically important Clerk family from the suburb of Osu in Accra. Early life and education Clerk was born on 4 March 1820 or 1823 on Fairfield Plantage near Spur Tree, Manchester Parish under British colonial rule. Little is known of Clerk's parentage and childhood other than his parents were Jamaican Christians. He was the third son among five brothers and four sisters. In 1833, when Alexander Clerk was about thirteen years old, the \\"apprenticeship act\\", granting immediate and full freedom to children six years of age and younger, and an intermediate status for those older, was enacted. Between 1838 and 1842, Clerk studied Christian theology, ministry, dogmatics and homiletics; philosophy and ethics; pedagogy and education at the now defunct Fairfield Teachers‚Äô Seminary (Lehrerseminar Fairfield), a teacher's training college and theological seminary, founded in 1837 by the Rev. Jacob Zorn (1803 ‚Äì 1843), a German-speaking Danish subject and a superintendent of the Moravian Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands from 1834 until his death in 1843. Zorn was also a missionary of the London-based Missions of the Church of the United Brethren and its sister organisation, The Brethren‚Äôs Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel. The Jamaican branch of the Moravian Church, which had its early beginnings in 1754, had by then been in the West Indies for nearly hundred years. The first Moravian missionaries in Jamaica were Zecharias Georg Caries, Thomas Shallcross and Gottlieb Haberecht, who evangelised to slaves on the Bogue Estate and later, to surrounding plantations. As part of his classical education, Clerk also studied languages: German, Latin, Greek and Hebrew. The training institute was established by Zorn at the behest of the Moravian mission leadership to prepare young Jamaican men for Christian evangelism, catechism and the propagation of the Gospel in the West Indies after the abolishment of slavery in the British Empire in 1834 followed by the full emancipation of slaves in Jamaica on 1 August 1838, a little over a year after Queen Victoria's ascension to the throne. Zorn also envisioned sending graduates from his small missionary training school to evangelical mission in Africa. Clerk was also mentored by the Rev. J. Blandfield at the Moravian school. Clerk's education was funded by a wealthy Victorian Christian woman from Bath, Somerset, Mrs. P. Skeate (n√©e Ibbett) . A. W. Clerk maintained correspondence with his English benefactor when he later worked on the Gold Coast as a teacher-missionary. Clerk was set to become a teacher-catechist and a missionary affiliated to the Fairfield Moravian Church mission presbytery or classis, (founded on 1 January 1826) after his graduation from the seminary and subsequent consecration in 1842. Missionary activities on the Gold Coast =Historical context= Early accounts indicate that the Moravian Church in Herrnhut in Saxony, Germany, recruited an inhabitant of the Gold Coast in 1735 and trained him in the arts and philosophy at the University of Copenhagen. However, on his return to the Gold Coast, the man found out that he could barely speak his mother tongue. A series of European missions were embarked upon by these Protestant missionary bodies, including the Dutch Missionary Society, North German Missionary Society, Baptist Missionary Society and the Church Missionary Society. Some missionaries died within a few years, others within a few months. The Directors of the Danish Guinea Company invited Missions of the Church of the United Brethren, a missionary society of the Moravian Church to the Gold Coast, to teach at the castle and fort schools with five missionaries arriving at Christiansborg in 1768. The first two batches of eleven missionaries all died within a short period from tropical diseases such as malaria, blackwater fever, yellow fever and dysentery, having not fully acclimatised to the local environment. European missionaries who operated in the Caribbean, Latin America and Southeast Asia were also infected with dengue fever. A group of Christian Protestants from the Lutheran Moravians and other sister Reformed Churches in Germany and Switzerland founded the German Missionary Society in 1815 as \\"the result of a pledge taken by a few dedicated Christians at Basel in the face of a military threat.\\" \\"If God would spare their city, they pledged to begin a seminary for the training of missionaries,\\" the Christian believers asserted. The mission later changed its name to the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society, and finally the Basel Mission. This German Missionary Society had roots in the Deutsche Christentumgesellschaft, established in Basel in 1780 as a Bible reading fellowship that sought to disseminate Christian literature. They envisioned working with established missionary societies already operating in \\"unevangelized areas\\" in the world. In 1825, the Governor of the Danish Protectorate, Christiansborg (Osu), Major Johan Christopher von Richelieu, upon the observation of the degradation of moral values of European residents living within and without the Danish fort, Christiansborg Castle, requested the Danish Crown, through the Rev. Bone Falck R√∏nne (1764‚Äì1833), founder and board chair of the Danish Missionary Society (established on 17 June 1821), who represented Basel Mission interests in Denmark, to arrange for missionaries from the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society in Switzerland to evangelize in the then Gold Coast colony.For a decade and half, the chaplain's station at the Christiansborg Castle had remained vacant. Richelieu acted as a chaplain and reinstated public Christian worship, set up a school where 150 pupils were baptised and educated. More hands were therefore needed for evangelism. In March 1827, four young men from rural Switzerland and southern Germany between the ages of 23 and 27 years were selected by the Basel Mission. They were: Karl F. Salbach (27 years), Gottlieb Holzwath (26 years), Johannes Henke (23 years) and the Swiss-born Johannes Gottlieb Schmidt (24 years). They were skilled tradesmen with practical training experience in pottery, carpentry, shoe-making, masonry, joinery hat-making and black- smithing. In Christiansborg, Accra, they also started the Basel Mission Trading Factory to export palm oil and other local products to fund the mission work and also set up an artisan workshop to train local entrepreneurs in advanced methods of tradesmanship in order to serve their communities on the Gold Coast and in West Africa, which in the view of the Basel committee, was a way of atoning for the horror and devastating effects of the slave trade brought on by European colonialism. According to church history, their priorities were \\"to become acclimatised, to take time over the selection of a permanent site for the mission, to master the local language at all costs, to begin actual mission activity by founding a school, and lastly to present the Gospel with love and patience...to show to the people an inexhaustible forbearance and an excess of beneficent love, even though only a few of the thousand bleeding wounds may be healed which greed of gain and the cruel craftiness of the European have caused.\\" They arrived in Christiansborg on 18 December 1828 and had their first church service at a coastal hamlet called Amanfon, near Osu on 28 December 1828. All but Johannes Henke died within eight months of their arrival (August 1829) from malaria and other tropical diseases. Henke eventually died on 22 November 1831. On 21 March 1832, a second batch of three missionaries made up of the Rev. Andreas Riis, the Rev. Peter Peterson Jager and Dr. Christian Frederich Heinze, a physician arrived to continue the work. Five weeks after their arrival, the medical doctor who was supposed to take care of the health needs of the other two missionaries died of malaria on 26 April 1832. The Rev. P. P. Jager also died on 18 July 1832. The Rev. Andreas Riis, a Danish minister was the only surviving missionary. After becoming ill from malaria fever, a native herbalist, introduced to Riis by his Euro-African trader friend and a friend of the mission, George Lutterodt, treated him with lemon, soap, a cold bath and naturally occurring quinine in tree bark. After his recovery, Lutterodt advised Riis to move to the hilly countryside in Akropong ‚Äì Akuapem where the climate is much cooler and had a more conducive environment. In January 1835, Riis and his friend were warmly received by the then Omanhene of Akuapem, Nana Addo Dankwa I. They finally moved and settled at Akropong on 26 March 1835. Osiadan, meaning \\"builder in the Akan language, is what Riis was affectionately called, because he had built his house made of stones and timber. He ate local foods and spoke Akuapem Twi just like the people of Akropong. Riis lived like the locals at the time, residing in the forested hinterlands, using palm branches as sleeping mats and eating regional delicacies like peppersoup, snails and wormfish by some accounts. After settling for a year and with the approval of the Home Committee of the Basel Mission, Riis arranged to get a wife called Anna Margaretha Wolters, a twenty year old Danish lady. Among those who came with her were Andreas Stranger and Johannes Murdter. Stranger died on Christmas Eve in 1837 and Riis‚Äô own infant died at the close of 1838. Riis had become the symbol of hope for the evangelical revival in the missionary work. Riis‚Äô poor health condition, the rough terrain and the high death rates of European missionaries, sometimes reaching eighty percent, coupled with the failure of the missionary work compelled the Basel Missionary Society to abandon the work and recall Riis. For eight years, Riis had been unable to convert a native to Christianity and could not boast of a single baptism. In 1840, Andreas Riis travelled through Akwamu, Shai, Kroboland, Akim Abuakwa, and Cape Coast and arrived in Kumasi in 1840. Seeing that conditions were too harsh to contain, the Basel Mission authorities were displeased and Riis was recalled to Switzerland - the mission was to be closed. At the valedictory durbar organised in honour of Riis, the paramount chief, Omanhene of Akuapem, is known to have remarked, \\"When God created the world, He made the Book (Bible) for the European and animism (fetish) for the African, but if you could show us some Africans who could read the Bible, then we would surely follow you\\". =Arrival of West Indian missionaries= Alexander Worthy Clerk, Aburi, Gold Coast, c. 1861 This chief's coded message gave Riis and the Basel Mission Society food for thought. The dawn of a new day for African missions appeared when contacts were made to involve Afro-Caribbean Christians from the West Indies in the mission to Africa. Already, such a suggestion had come to Basel from England, but the impetus for Basel's involvement must have come from Riis. Riis arrived at the European headquarters of the Basel Mission on 7 July 1840 and immediately conferred with the directors of the mission who had already decided to end the mission's operations in West Africa. Riis then made a compelling case by narrating the Akropong's chief farewell address to the mission's board committee. The directors agreed to go to the Caribbean islands with the aim of finding the descendants of freed slaves who were perhaps better suited or adapted to acclimatise to the West African tropical environment, which had a similar climate to the West Indies. Morally, they were well-equipped to handle missionary work due to their strong sense of social mission, gleaned from the abolitionist and emancipation movements, and an imbibing of the Moravian Christian educational ethos in the West Indies. Furthermore, the Afro-Caribbean recruits had no immediate links to families or clans or ethnic groups in Africa which made them neutral agents in evangelical efforts. Sometime in 1842, the Home Committee selected new missionary graduate, the Rev. Johann Georg Widmann (1814 ‚Äì 1876), the assistant missionary, Hermann Halleur and the Beuggen and Basel-trained Americo-Liberian mission teacher, George Peter Thompson (1819 ‚Äì 1889) to go to Jamaica to recruit Christians of African descent. On 28 May 1842, Andreas Riis and his wife, Anna Wolters, Widmann together with Thompson left Basel for the British leeward island of Antigua in the West Indies via Gravesend and Liverpool to engage and recruit black Christian men who would accompany them to West Africa while Halleur went directly to the Gold Coast to prepare the grounds for their arrival. With the assistance of James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, the Governor of Jamaica at the time, the Rev. Jacob Zorn, the Superintendent of the Moravian Mission in Jamaica, the Rev. Jacob F. Sessing and the Rev. J. Miller, an agent of the Africa Civilization Society, Riis was able to recruit candidates after a mass appeal across the island and an extensive and rigorous interview process. Many of the prospective volunteers or \\"repatriates\\" who initially applied to the programme were found to be unsuitable: a few were lapsed Christians, one was excited about the adventure and wished to mine for gold, another had an invalid wife who was too ill to travel while other potential recruits wished merely to return to the motherland, Africa, the mission work not being a top priority in their minds. It was quite an arduous task finding the right candidates to the extent that Riis and other Basel missionaries almost gave up on the initiative. Riis met Clerk's teacher, the Moravian, Jacob Zorn who insisted on a proper contract of service between these Jamaican missionaries represented by the Conference of the Jamaican Moravian Mission and the Basel Mission. The agreement stipulated among other things, that: * \\"The form of public worship and the rules of the Moravian Church in regard to church discipline were to be maintained * The West Indians were to undertake to serve the mission willingly. In return the mission would take care of all their needs for the first two years * The Basel Mission would provide houses for the West Indians and give them land for farming and gardening, on which they could work one day per week * At the end of the first two years, the West Indians could choose to either follow their own source of employment or to work for the Basel Mission at a reasonable wage * After five years, if anyone wanted to return to Jamaica, the Basel Mission would pay the passage, provided that they had not been guilty of moral aberration.\\" The provision which allowed the West Indian Moravians to use their own form of worship and discipline was an indication of the extent to which both the Moravians and the Basel Mission were prepared to go in order to enlist Afro- Caribbean Christians in the mission. Given the historical similarities between the Moravian and Basel missions due to their shared Lutheran heritage, the alliance was the commencement of a new and effective model in the mission entreprise which had profound socio-cultural effects on the indigenous community in Ghana. Before their departure from Jamaica, an emotional farewell service was held at the Moravian Churches at Lititz and Fairfield for the missionaries and their families. Amidst tears and hugs, the West Indian emigrants made it known to their families and church congregations in a valedictory address telling them: ‚ÄúWhen we go to Africa, we go not to a foreign country. Africa is our country and our home. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers were taken from there and brought here. We go there to witness the Grace of God not only to the European, but also to the African and our only prayer is that the eyes of the Africans whom we regard as our brothers may be opened to see Jesus Christ as Saviour of the World.‚Äù The Jamaicans were essentially a bridge to share the Gospel with the Gold Coast natives while connecting with their ancestral and cultural roots in Africa. In an allegory of the Biblical Joseph narrative, a team of 24 Jamaicans and one Antiguan (6 distinct families and 3 bachelors) sailed from the port at Kingston on 8 February 1843 aboard the Irish brigantine, The Joseph Anderson, rented for ¬£600, and according to varying historical accounts, arrived in Christiansborg, Gold Coast on Easter Sunday, 16 April or Easter Monday, 17 April 1843 at about 8 p.m. local time (GMT) after sixty-eight days and nights of voyage, enduring a five-day tropical storm on the Caribbean sea, shortage of fresh water and an oppressive heat aboard the vessel. A short welcome ceremony was held for them by the Basel Mission at the Christiansborg Castle, where they were warmly received by Edvard James Arnold Carstensen, the Danish Governor at the time, together with George Lutterodt, a mulatto and personal friend of Andreas Riis who had earlier been acting Governor of the Gold Coast. The West Indians rested for a while on the coast before leaving for Frederikgave on 10 May 1843, the old villa and royal plantation of the Danish Governor at modern day Sesemi village near the Akwapim hills. While in Accra, half of the group stayed with Lutterodt while the rest of the West Indians stayed in the home of another Euro-African called Yestrop. Apart from A. W. Clerk from the Fairfield congregation, who was already a trained mission agent, other Moravian missionary recruits doubled as skilled craftsmen: * Joseph Miller of Fairfield, a farm worker, with his wife, Mary and children, Rose Ann, Robert and Catherine * John Rochester of Fairfield, a cooper, with his wife Mary, sister, Ann and son John Powell Rochester * James Greene of the Nazareth congregation, a carpenter, with his wife, Catherine and son, Robert * John Hall of Irwin Hill, Montego Bay, a rum distiller and his wife Mary and son Andrew * James G. Mullings of the Bethlehem church, a domestic servant, with his wife Margarethe and daughter, Catharine Elisa * Edward Walker of the Bethlehem church, a farm worker, with wife, Sarah and son John * David Robinson of Fulneck, a farm worker * Jonas Horsford of the Grace Hill church, Liberta Village in Antigua In addition, the West Indians were accompanied by an Angolan-born, Jamaican-raised school teacher named Catherine Mulgrave, also from Fairfield who was the bride of George Peter Thompson and became the Headmistress of the then Danish-run Christiansborg Castle School in Osu, Accra, which was taken over by the Basel Mission. Anquandah, James (2006). Ghana-Caribbean Relations ‚Äì From Slavery Times to Present: Lecture to the Ghana-Caribbean Association. National Commission on Culture, Ghana: Riis also had the Rev. Johann Georg Widmann, a German clergyman as his assistant. They also had donkeys, horses, mulls and other animals and agricultural seeds and cuttings such as mango seedlings which they were going to introduce to the Gold Coast economy. Other tropical seedlings brought by the West Indian missionaries include cocoa, coffee, breadnut, breadfruit, guava, yam, cassava, plantains, cocoyam, variety of banana species and pear. Cocoyam, for example, is now a Ghanaian staple. Later on in 1858, the missionaries experimented with cocoa planting at Akropong, more than two decades before Tetteh Quarshie brought cocoa seedlings to the Gold Coast from the island of Fernando Po, now known as Bioko in the Equatorial Guinea. =Mission enterprise at Akropong= Majority of the West Indians relocated to Akropong from Frederiksgave between 17 and 18 June 1843. While at the villa, Mary Hall gave birth to her second son, Henry who was baptised by Johann Georg Widmann. The local people received the West Indians with enthusiasm but were later disappointed \\"because we [the West Indians] did not bring them money and brandy\\" as remarked by one of the missionaries, Joseph Miller. Nonetheless, they settled in and wholly \\"trusted the Akuapem people\\" and formed close friendships with the natives who became their interpreters as they could not originally communicate in the local Twi language; they later incorporated Akan vocabulary into their Jamaican Patois. The political unrest in Akropong within the period 1839 to 1850 hampered the missionary effort. Clerk and his colleagues started work immediately since the houses they were promised were actually in disrepair. As per historical literature, they built the first brick and stone houses in Akropong and the area of West Indian settlement became known as Hanover, a connection to the parish (region) in northwest Jamaica. Hanover was described as a \\"community lined with mango trees\\" as seen in Jamaican neighbourhoods even today. There is even a Hanover Street in Akropong built circa 1860: the street of little stone houses built by the Jamaicans which now runs parallel to the north boundary of the Presbyterian Training College (PTC). There is still a water well called Jamaica in Aburi that was built by Jamaican Moravian, John Rochester and local labourers dating back to the 1850/60s. Based on an 1851 headcount, 25 out of the total 31 Christians at Akropong were West Indian. There was a cordial atmosphere in the West Indian community as the Caribbean settlers saw one another as brothers and sisters. Initially, as local mission president, Riis had to be master of all trades: pastor, administrator, bursar, accountant, carpenter, architect and a public relations officer between the Mission and the traditional rulers. Hermann Halleur was the mission station manager responsible for all economic activities while J. G. Widmann was appointed the school inspector and Basel minister-in-charge of the Christ Presbyterian Church, Akropong. As a result of his previous experience as an elder in his home church in Irwin Hill in Montego Bay, John Hall became the first Presbyter of the church while Alexander Worthy Clerk became the first deacon with an additional role in distributing food supplies like corn and imported clothing to his fellow Caribbean emigrants. Clerk was also put in charge of teaching the children of the settlers at the then newly established infant school at Akropong. John Rochester supervised the agricultural work of the mission. As more missionaries were recruited for the mission, the burden of the administrator increased. Riis and another Basel missionary, Simon S√ºss were forced by the situation to trade and barter in order to get money to buy food and other needs of his expanding mission staff and local workers. The missionaries faced many difficulties and one of the many charges levelled against them by their detractors was that they had become commercial traders instead of church missionaries. Riis and his men started evangelising to the rural people around Akropong; the Basel Mission became colloquially known as \\"rural\\" or \\"bush\\" church. Riis wanted to address paganism inland and to learn the Akan language spoken more widely in the hinterlands of the Gold Coast. Riis as a disciplinarian suspended the Americo-Liberian missionary, George Thompson who failed in his mission at Osu in 1845. The first Christian baptisms were performed by the Jamaicans in 1847 when a theological seminary was established at Christiansborg, Osu. Another seminary, the Basel Mission Seminary (later Presbyterian College of Education) was established in 1848 to train natives in the work of the mission. Later on, the Christiansborg seminary was permanently moved to the Akropong campus and merged with the Basel Mission Seminary there. Upon the opening of the seminary, the Sierra Leonean Pan-Africanist, James Africanus Beale Horton noted that, \\"it is indeed an academic achievement which can very well hold its own in comparison with European Training Colleges of the period.\\" The school produced teacher- catechists whose roles were pivotal in Christian evangelism as the curriculum grounded students in the theory and practice of general education and pedagogy as well as a classic seminary training. There were also plans in 1845 to import prospective students from Barbados but those plans were shelved as there was a greater need to train local scholars and preachers. The catechist educational model was based on the Church Missionary Society system in which trained catechists who were non-ordained pastors and regarded as probationers for a number of years before being elevated to the position of church minister. Challenges in the early days were not uncommon. It was documented that \\"by January 1845 some of the West Indian Christians had grown weary of the Christian experiment and wrote to the Basel Mission requesting repatriation to the West Indies but the mission refused‚Äù citing the signed agreement. In 1848, a few West Indian emigrants opted to return to Jamaica upon the expiration of the five-year residency requirement in the original contract with the Basel Mission. David Robinson died in 1850 on the Gold Coast from persistent illness. As tensions continued to rise between the Basel Mission and the West Indians, the Walkers became disenchanted, left the mission station at Akropong and relocated to Accra before permanently settling in Cape Coast. Some disagreements among the Caribbean settlers over the distribution of clothing supplies resulted in the flogging of Antiguan, Jonas Horsford by Andreas Riis and the labourer-foreman, Ashong. Horsford, who was then in his early twenties, fled to Osu, Accra and later, Cape Coast out of anger and humiliation. He was voluntarily repatriated to Antigua but died at sea on his way home. The Greenes requested repatriation to Jamaica in 1849, only for Catherine, wife of James to die at sea from apparent terminal breast cancer which was diagnosed while she was living in Akropong. A Basel missionary, Johann Friedrich Meischel believed Mrs. Catherine Greene negatively influenced her husband to be wary of the European missionaries as the Greenes thought the society would renege on its promise to repatriate Caribbean missionary-volunteers after five years if they desired to. Five Caribbean families remained to form the nucleus of the African Christian community at Akropong: Alexander Worthy Clerk, John Hall, Joseph Miller, James Gabriel Mullings, John Powell Rochester and their respective families. According to historical archives,\\"‚Ä¶the mission took steps to secure farming land for the West Indian families that decided to stay. The mission purchased land near Adami for the Miller and the Hall families and at Adobesum on the road to Amanprobi for the Mullings and Rochester families. Land was secured for the Clerk family in Aburi at a place called Little Jamaica today.‚Äù He was a missionary in villages and towns in the Akuapem area from 1864 and 1867. In 1867, Clerk was sent to Tutu, a town in the Akuapem area and raised funds locally for the construction of the first Basel Mission chapel there. On 1 September 1872, together with indigenous Akan native pastor, Theophilus Opoku, Alexander Worthy Clerk was ordained a full Basel Mission minister by the Basel missionary, the Rev. Johann Georg Widmann. The Gold Coast historian, Carl Christian Reindorf was ordained six weeks later on 13 October 1872. This ceremony was the beginning of ordination of local pastors for mission work. He later became the district minister of the Basel Mission Church at Aburi. Contributions to education Clerk and his fellow Caribbean missionaries were self-motivated and adapted quickly despite the initial homesickness and learnt the indigenous languages of Akan and Ga. The missionaries composed new local language hymns, translated church hymns into Ga and Akan from English and German, built stone houses, water wells and schools, set up large farms and taught the local people to read and write vastly improving literacy in the region. In 1848, thirty-seven girls, twenty-five boys and seven children of the West Indians attended the newly set-up, United Akropong School with Clerk as a founding schoolmaster. As a result of his hardwork, Clerk was nicknamed, \\"Suku Mansere\\", a bastardisation of \\"schoolmaster\\" in the Twi language. The West Indian children who were taught at the school included Andrew Hall, Rose Ann Miller, Robert Miller, Catherine Miller, Elizabeth Mullings, Ann Rochester and John Rochester. The girls‚Äô school was later transferred to Aburi in 1854 to become the Girls‚Äô Senior School, predecessor to the present-day Aburi Girls‚Äô Secondary School. Rose-Ann Miller, daughter of Jamaican missionaries, Joseph and Mary Miller, who had previously run the infant school at Akropong in 1857 was put in charge of the girls' school at Aburi in 1859 until 1874 when she voluntarily left the Basel Mission to work at the state-run Government Girls' School in Accra. Clerk and other missionaries also trained native catechists to help them in their evangelical work and play significant roles in the Basel Mission at the then newly established Basel Mission Training College in 1848 (now Presbyterian College of Education) as the second oldest higher educational institution in West Africa after Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Freetown, Sierra Leone. At the seminary, Clerk was given a new role as an instructor of Biblical studies. Clerk's students in the pioneer class included John Powell Rochester, David Asante, Paul Staudt Keteku, William Yirenkyi and Jonathan Bekoe Palmer. These seminarians later became teacher-catechists and pastors in the service of the mission. A few years earlier, on 27 November 1843, an English language all boys‚Äô boarding middle school, the Salem School was opened at Christiansborg, the oldest existing school founded by the Basel Mission. The founding educators were all missionaries: Jamaicans, Alexander Worthy Clerk and Catherine Mulgrave (1827‚Äì1891) as well as George Thompson, the German-trained Americo-Liberian missionary. Mulgrave was born in Angola but raised in Jamaica after being rescued as a six-year old from Portuguese slave traders. She recalled her mother calling her by the Angolan name \\"Gewe\\" as a child and was adopted by the then Governor of Jamaica, Earl of Mulgrave and his wife, Lady Mulgrave who educated her at the Female Refuge School followed by teacher training at the Mico Institution in Kingston, Jamaica. Between 1843 and 1891, Mulgrave also established various boarding schools for girls at Osu, Abokobi and Odumase, with curricula that emphasised arithmetic, reading, writing, needlework, gardening and household chores. The West Indians introduced English as the preferred medium of instruction in school and this gained wide acceptance after the Danes sold their forts and castles on the eastern board of the Gold Coast, including Osu, to the British in 1850. In the 19th century, the name Salem described that part of town where the early European Basel missionaries had settled together with their converts. Originally, the term Salem included the church, the school and other buildings in the Christian quarter of the town The school was built around a quadrangle with the classrooms on one side, dormitories on the other and the headmaster's and teachers‚Äô residences on the other side. This arrangement kept teachers and pupils in constant touch with one another. Salem, therefore had a \\"Christian village culture\\" that was typical in the European small towns and villages many Basel missionaries hailed from. The school curriculum was rigorous: It included English and Ga languages, arithmetic, geography, history, religious knowledge, nature study, hygiene, handwriting and music. There was also instruction in arts and crafts, including pottery, carpentry, basket and mat weaving and practical lessons in agriculture on the school farm. Christian religious training was core to the curriculum with compulsory church attendance required of all pupils. A strict disciplinary code, based on austere living was enforced. The early years of the school were difficult. Within a year of its establishment, Clerk was sent to Akropong to start a similar school there. In 1854, the British authorities, aided by the colonial forces, bombarded the town of Osu for two days using the warship, \\"H.M. Scourge\\" after the indigenes refused to pay the newly imposed poll-tax. Several parts of the town were destroyed. The young school together with a large number of new African converts moved to Abokobi. The school was transferred back to Osu to the place called Salem around 1857. Later, similar Salem schools were established in Peki, La, Teshie, Odumase, Ada Foah, Kibi, Abetifi and Nsaba. Many of the school's alumni later became administrators, accountants, bankers, civil servants, dentists, diplomats, engineers, judges, lawyers, medical doctors, political leaders, professors and teachers in the colonial era. The Christian-rooted Basel training the Salem alumni received in their formative years instilled in them a strong sense of noblesse oblige. From the mid nineteenth century to the latter part of the twentieth century, Salem old boys dominated many facets of public life and society, and formed a nucleus of the nouvelle haute bourgeoisie in the Gold Coast colonial social hierarchy. Despite being highly educated by all standards; self-taught and multilingual in several Ghanaian, Caribbean and European languages (Ga, Twi, English, Jamaican Creole and German), the Home Committee in Basel never accorded Clerk the full or maximum respect he deserved as a Basel missionary, minister and educator during his lifetime. He and his other Caribbean colleagues in particular, were instead seen by the Europeans as having the same status as administrative assistants or mission helps, leading sometimes to strained relations with the Basel Mission. Personal life and ancestry = Lineage = Clerk was a descendant of eighteenth century West African slaves who were captured by slave traders and forcibly brought to the Caribbean island to work on coffee and sugar plantations at the height of the transatlantic slave trade. Some of these Jamaican slaves were possibly of Asante origin as per some oral narratives, and from the middle belt of present-day Ghana, while others originated from the Ghanaian coastal corridor, largely populated by Gas and Fantes. Later on, many slaves were also taken from Igbo and Yoruba communities in modern-day Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Genealogical research based on a registry of Jamaican births and baptisms between 1752 and 1920 showed earlier records of a Jamaican family with the Clerk surname. An individual named John Clerk (the older) had his two children, James Shaw Clerk and Mary Ann Clerk baptised on 21 November 1793 at St. James, Trelawny in the county of Cornwall, Jamaica. Other members of this family were Fanny, Richard Brian and John Clerk (the younger), all christened on 30 August 1798 in Hanover, Jamaica. = Marriage = Pauline Hesse, Aburi, Gold Coast, c. 1861 On 30 August 1848, Clerk married Pauline Hesse (born 3 May 1831) of Osu Amantra, the daughter of a Euro-Ga merchant, Herman Hesse of the Hesse family and a Ga-Dangme woman, Charlotte Lamiaakaa, who hailed from a trading family at Shai Hills. Pauline Hesse's paternal grandfather, Dr. Lebrecht Wilhelm Hesse, was an eighteenth century-Danish physician of German ethnicity. Hesse-Clerk was Basel Mission-trained and educated at the Danish language Christiansborg Castle School in Osu. One of her schoolteachers was Catherine Mulgrave, the Basel Mission's first woman educator on the Gold Coast. Hesse's schoolmates included her sisters, Mary (Mrs. Richter), Wilhelmina (Mrs. Briandt), Regina (1832 ‚Äì1898), a teacher who later married Hermann Ludwig Rottmann, the first Basel missionary-trader in Christiansborg and the founder of the Basel Mission Trading Company. Her brother, William Hesse (1834 ‚Äì1920) was Basel Mission pastor. Another schoolmate was the historian and minister, Carl Christian Reindorf (1834 ‚Äì1917), whose seminal book, The History of the Gold Coast and Asante, was published in 1895. The Christiansborg Castle School, opened in 1722, was very similar to the Cape Coast Castle School established by the Anglican vicar, the Reverend Thompson and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) affiliated to the Church of England Danish was the medium of instruction at the Christiansborg School. The castle schools were established by the European Governors to baptise and primarily educate the male Euro-African mulatto children of European men and Gold Coast African women for eventual employment as administrative assistants and soldiers in the colonial civil service. Later on, Hesse-Clerk became a small business owner and a commercial trader. As a result of the 1854 bombardment of Osu and the ensuing forced displacement of its residents, a brother-in-law of Clerk, John Hesse, relocated to Akropong as a domestic refugee and engaged in petty trading together with other Ga-Dangme traders who had also fled the bombing. The couple had twelve children but one, the Rev. A. W. Clerk's namesake, Alexander Worthy, died at birth: Caroline Rebecca (Mrs. Svaniker), John Patrick, Louisa, Ophelia (died in childhood from measles), Charles Emmanuel, Richard Alfred, Nicholas Timothy, Jane Elizabeth (Mrs. Bruce), Mary Anne, Matilda Johanna (Mrs. Lokko) and Christian Clerk who died in his youth in a drowning accident in the Gulf of Guinea. Thus, A. W. Clerk became the patriarch of the historically notable Clerk family of Accra by virtue of his 1843 arrival to the Gold Coast as a bachelor and his subsequent 1848 marriage to Pauline Hesse.  Selected works  A. W. Clerk wrote and translated hymns from German into the Ga language. These hymns are captured in the Presbyterian Hymnals and are still used by the Presbyterian Church of Ghana for its church services: * M…õni Yesu efee eham'? - What is there Christ has done for me? (PHB 497) * M…î ni ji Kristo kasel…î - All you that follow Jesus Christ (PHB 528), translated from a German hymn, originally written by the Swiss-Italian Pietist theologian and hymn composer, Hieronymus Annoni (1697 ‚Äì 1770) Death and legacy Clerk died of natural causes on 11 February 1906, three weeks before his eighty-sixth birthday at his home, Fairfield House, in Aburi, 20 miles (32 km) north of Accra. He was buried at the old Basel Mission Cemetery near the Aburi Botanical Gardens in Aburi. As an opinion leader at Aburi, Clerk had been influential in the choice of the campus of the botanical garden. Clerk's widow, Pauline Hesse-Clerk died on 18 August 1909 at the age of 78 years; she was buried next to her husband. During World War I, German missionaries working left the Gold Coast and Scottish Presbyterian missionaries came and served the Christians of the Moravian Church. Sometime after the war ended, the Germans sought to renew their dominant influence but the Gold Coast Christians declared a strong preference for the Presbyterian Church brought there by the Scots. In a fitting tribute to the legacy of Clerk, other West Indian missionaries and the Basel Mission, the British Governor of the Gold Coast during World War I, Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg, reacted to the expulsion of Basel Mission as alien security risk from the Gold Coast by lamenting that, the forced departure was \\"the greatest blow which education in this country has ever suffered;\\" describing their work as the \\"first and foremost as regards quality of education and character training\\" ‚Äì a testament to the mission's approach of combining academic study with practical training for life. While propagation of the Gospel was the main objective of the West Indians and the Basel Mission, the domestic socioeconomic and dire educational environment motivated them to establish the first formal schools and colleges in the country, open to pupils from all walks of life. Moreover, the missionaries provided alternative sources of employment to rural inhabitants through the establishment of mechanized agriculture and commerce-driven small-scale artisanal industries such as construction and craftsmanship including printing, book-binding, tile manufacturing, brick-making and weaving in order to create self-sufficiency among the natives. To accentuate this point, the scholar, Noel Smith noted in 1966, \\"In education and in agriculture, in artisan training and in the development of commerce, in medical services and in concern for the social welfare of the people, the name 'Basel' by the time of the expulsion of the Mission from the country had become a treasured word in the minds of the people.\\" The Presbyterian Church of Ghana today duly remembers and recognises Clerk and the other West Indian missionaries for their pioneering role in the Protestant Christian movement in Ghana. The church continues to maintain much of the Jamaican church liturgy, order and discipline that were imported to Ghana in the nineteenth century and is a strong mission-minded one. The denomination currently has nearly 1 million members constituting about a quarter of the Ghanaian Christian Protestant demographic and about four- percent of the national population. The Presbyterian Church of Ghana today has instituted \\"Presbyterian Day\\" or \\"Ebenezer Day\\", a special Sunday designated in the church almanac to honour the memories, selfless work and toil of the missionaries in the early years. The names of Alexander Clerk and his son Nicholas Clerk appear on a commemorative plaque in the sanctuary of the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu, listing pioneering missionaries of the church, in recognition of their contributions to formal education and the growth of the Presbyterian faith in Ghana. In the sanctuary of the Christ Presbyterian Church, Akropong, a tablet memorialises the life and work of Alexander W. Clerk and his Caribbean compatriots, Joseph Miller, John Hall, John Rochester, James Mullings, John Walker, James Green and Antiguan Jonas Horsford. In addition to increased access to education, A. W. Clerk and other Basel Mission and West Indian missionaries were also instrumental in the expansion of hospitals, social welfare programs, medical services or healthcare as well as the development of infrastructure including roads and the growth of commerce and agriculture to support church mission activities. Today, the church maintains schools, colleges and health centres in many cities and towns in Ghana including Abetifi, Aburi, Agogo, Bawku, Donkorkrom, Dormaa Ahenkro and Enchi. In order to preserve the old culture, the usage of vernacular as the principal medium of ministry continues to be emphasised by the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. Clerk's lineage or progeny has played pioneering roles in the development of architecture, church development, civil service, diplomacy, education, health services, journalism, medicine, natural sciences, public administration, public health public policy and urban planning on the Gold Coast and in modern Ghana. His son, Nicholas Timothy Clerk was a Basel-trained theologian who served as the first Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1918 to 1932 campaigned for a secondary school, culminating in the establishment of Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School in 1938. Peter Hall, the son of John Hall, Clerk's fellow Jamaican missionary, was also elected the first Moderator of Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast in 1918. Other second generation descendants of the Jamaicans who were instrumental in strengthening the country's educational foundations laid by their Caribbean forebears include John Powell Rochester, Timothy Mullings, Henry Hall, James Hall, Caroline Clerk, Patrick Clerk, Charles Clerk, Rose Ann Miller and Emil Miller. As agriculturists, educators, craftsmen and preachers, they toiled to provide formal education in the communities they worked in.

His father was the Jamaican Moravian missionary Alexander Worthy Clerk (1820 ‚Äì 1906), who worked on the Gold Coast with the Basel Mission and co-founded in 1843 the Salem School, a Presbyterian boarding middle school for boys. N. T. Clerk was elected the first Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast, in effect, the chief administrator and overall strategy lead of the national church organisation, a position he held from 1918 to 1932. A staunch advocate of secondary education, Nicholas Timothy Clerk became a founding father of the all-boys Presbyterian boarding school in Ghana, the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School, established in 1938. As Synod Clerk, he pushed vigorously for and was instrumental in turning the original idea of a church mission high school into reality. Early life and education = Gold Coast = Clerk was born on 28 October 1862 at Aburi, about twenty miles north-east of the Ghanaian capital, Accra. N. T. Clerk was a second generation descendant of the historic Clerk family of Accra. His father was Alexander Worthy Clerk, a Jamaican Moravian missionary who was among the first group of West Indians, recruited by the Danish minister, Andreas Riis (1804‚Äì1854) of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society in 1843. Riis lived on the Gold Coast from 1832 to 1845. His mother, Pauline Hesse (1831‚Äì1909) was from the Gold Coast, and was of Danish, German and Ga descent. His aunt was Regina Hesse (1832 ‚Äì1898), a pioneer educator and school principal. He studied at Basel Mission primary and boarding middle schools in Aburi. During his basic school years, Clerk took subjects in reading, writing, arithmetic, biblical studies, history, geography, science, music and general religion. This was followed by pedagogy and theology training at the Basel Mission Seminary, now the Presbyterian College of Education, Akropong, in the state of Akuapem, 32 miles (51 km) north-north-east of Accra where he showed strong interest in Christian missionary work and stayed until the end of 1883. He was described by his biographer, the Swiss German church historian and theologian, Hans Werner Debrunner, as \\"a sturdy lad who had inherited his father's intelligence...and was by far the best student\\" at the Akropong seminary. The Basel missionaries founded the Akropong seminary in 1848 as the second oldest higher educational institution in early modern West Africa after Fourah Bay College, established in 1827. Nicholas Clerk spent his summers helping the German Huppenbauer missionary family household at Aburi. In 1884, Mrs. Huppenbauer gave birth to a baby, Carl. Nicholas, together with others assisted in the care of the baby while Mrs. Huppenbauer underwent emergency surgery to amputate a gangrene- afflicted leg, performed by Dr. Mahly, an ethnologist and a linguist, who used a hand saw, a bread knife and silk thread for the procedure. After a short period of recovery, the Huppenbauer family returned to Germany with Nicholas Clerk who was about to continue his seminary studies in Europe. = Germany and Switzerland = Nicholas Timothy Clerk, Basel, Switzerland, 1888 Nicholas Clerk spent a year (1884 ‚Äì 1885) in Schorndorf, about 42 miles (26 km) east of Stuttgart, Germany, learning Latin, Greek and Hebrew and mastering German while living with and studying under the award-winning German philologist, Johann Gottlieb Christaller who had earlier been influential in the translation of the Bible into the Twi language with the help of Akan linguists and missionaries, David Asante, Theophilus Opoku, Jonathan Palmer Bekoe and Paul Staudt Keteku. Christaller was a two-time recipient (1876; 1882) of the most prestigious linguistics prize, The Prix Volney, awarded since 1822, by the Institut de France \\"to recognize work in general and comparative linguistics.\\" While living in Germany, Clerk assisted Christaller in completing some of his works in the Twi language. With the aid of a bursary awarded by the Basel Mission, Clerk then pursued further studies at the Basel Mission Seminary (Basler Missionsseminar) between August 1885 and July 1888, where he received advanced instruction in theology, philosophy and linguistics, with special emphasis on philology. His theology courses included dogmatics, homiletics and catechesis. Clerk was the third African to be educated in Europe by the Basel Mission after the Americo-Liberian pastor, George Peter Thompson, an 1842 alumnus and the native Akan missionary, David Asante who had earlier completed his training in 1862. The Basel mission also had a holistic and rigorous skills-based approach to educating its students. This was geared towards teaching them the survival know-how to especially endure harsh terrains during Christian missionary fieldwork. In this regard, in addition to his integrated classical education, N. T. Clerk received practical training in geography and cartography, botany, rudimentary civil engineering as well as basic natural science, medicine, anatomy and surgery. At Basel, Clerk suffered a nervous breakdown halfway through his studies but recovered quickly. He passed his final examinations, was consecrated in the Basel Minster as a missionary on 5 July 1888 and shortly thereafter, ordained a minister at Korntal, situated at the northwestern border of Stuttgart of the German state of . Briefly transiting in Liverpool in August 1888, he arrived in his homeland, two months later, in October 1888. Missionary work Nicholas Timothy Clerk, Gold Coast Clerk‚Äôs first station was at Anum, on the banks of the Volta River, about 50 miles (80 km) inland, where he arrived in October 1888. In August, 1890 he left Anum to start a mission station in the State of Buem in what is now the Volta Region of Ghana. He chose Worawora, more than 110 miles (176 km) from the coast, as his headquarters. In Worawora, he built a school, a chapel, an administrative office and a house for himself. He also constructed a water well for the Worawora community. In August of the 1891 he left Anum to establish a mission station in he worked at Boradaa in the Buem area and later became the principal evangelist there. In January 1894, Clerk was a delegate of the Synod of the Basel Mission held on the coast. N. T. Clerk preached against human sacrifice, persecution of albinos, witch-hunt, oppression of widows and orphans, superstitious killing of twins as well as ritual servitude and slavery, child labour and trafficking. He tried to encourage parents to send their children, including the girl-child, to school. He also tried to persuade adults to join the church, but adherence to the practice of polygamy (which was opposed by the Christian Church) made his work difficult. He had come to Buem at a time when it was still independent of either German or British rule, and when inter-tribal wars were not uncommon. The younger generation wanted him to side with them in community disputes with their elders. However, Clerk remained neutral, infuriating the youth who refused to cooperate with him In spite of many challenges, the Worawora mission station was making modest progress by 1898. In 1899, when the inhabitants moved from the hill to the valley, Clerk followed them, and established a new mission station. Buem had then become a part of the German Togoland, conditions of peace prevailed, and Clerk's work had become easier. Before the forcible German takeover of Buem, the inhabitants had wanted Clerk to persuade the British to annex the area, while the German administration, based in Lom√© on the coast, had sent a messenger to him to ask him to persuade the people of Buem to become German subjects, but he had refused to take sides based on his personal conviction and the apolitical code of conduct for a Basel missionary at the time which required that he remained neutral in all issues relating to colonial governance. With a family to support, Clerk struggled to live on his meagre ¬£10 monthly stipend, and occasionally felt that he should seek a more lucrative post. Dr. Gruner, the German district commissioner at Misahoh√©, nearly 50 miles (80 km) to the south in what is now the Republic of Togo, had heard of his plight, and in 1893 had written to him, offering him a permanent post in the civil service of the German administration with a starting monthly salary of 500 Deutsch marks. Nonetheless, Clerk once again refused to quit his mission job with the response that he considered the Basel Mission to be his \\"mother\\" and he cannot leave her side. Though he disliked the German way of treating Africans, and made them aware of it, he was still highly regarded by the Germans. Under German rule, parents were obliged to send their children to school, and cleanliness as well as hygiene were strictly enforced. Clerk taught his converts to plant cocoa using more modern mechanised methods and his pioneering work in agriculture bore fruit years later. The German administration insisted that Ewe should be taught in the mission's schools instead of the Basel-preferred language of Twi. As a result, Clerk could not continue his work in Buem. In the 1904 (the year he left), the Basel Mission station was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Bremen Mission. Clerk then moved to Berekum, near Sunyani, about 80 miles (128 km) northwest of Kumasi, in what is now the Brong -Ahafo Region of Ghana, and here he had intended to settle. The paramount chief however refused to grant him accommodation, and the inhabitants would not help him build a house. Nonetheless, the Rev. N. T. Clerk established the first congregation, in the Brong Ahafo Presbytery, the Berekum Congregation, in 1905 and was its first residential Minister. The Berekum Presbyterian District was founded in 1920. After nearly three lacklustre years and in the face of hostility, intimidation and poor health including a tapeworm infection, he was transferred to Larteh, just south of Akropong, where he found the work more pleasant, staying there as the resident district minister from 1907 to 1918. In an entrepreneurial drive and a practical approach to sustain their work, Clerk and several African Christian missionaries set up cocoa farms. With financial proceeds he received from his personal farm enterprise at Adawso, a few miles to the west, he was able to give his children high-quality education and raise them to become responsible professionals in society: a Protestant minister, an architect, teachers, a nurse, a medical doctor and fashion designers. An extensive collection of Nicholas Clerk's cartographic manuscripts and ethnographic reports, produced from his missionary work in numerous Ghanaian towns and villages, is housed at the Archives and Library of the Basel Mission / Mission 21 in Basel, Switzerland. Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church The Rev. N. T. Clerk The European members of the Basel Mission, however, did not treat their African colleagues as adults, and kept them out of the church and mission administration with central decisions concerning the local church made in Basel, Switzerland. Clerk resented this paternalism, and felt that the Basel Mission should become decentralized and Africanized and tailored more to the local context, a view which he communicated strongly to the European missionaries. The coming of the First World War (1914-1918) gave the African missionaries a chance to undertake heavier responsibilities, even though they had not been trained for them. When the Basel Mission was expelled from the Gold Coast in 1917 during World War I, the Free Church of Scotland led by the minister, A. W. Wilkie took over their work. A Synod (a Presbyterian judicatory or polity, composed of members from all presbyteries within its geographic jurisdiction) and a Synod Committee were established. Clerk was elected the first Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast on 14 August 1918; his tenure of office, as effectively the chief administrative officer and de facto organizational leader of the wholly indigenous and self- governing African church was from 1918 to 1932. In his inaugural address, N. T. Clerk passionately argued for a secondary school for boys, a pitch which was eventually taken up by the church leading to the establishment of the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School in 1938. Peter Hall, the son of John Hall, another Jamaican missionary was also elected the First Moderator of Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast in 1918. At the 1918 Synod held at the Christ Presbyterian Church, Akropong, Hall and Clerk authored the first constitution of the Ghanaian Presbyterian Church. At the Synod, the church retained its eleven districts: Christiansborg (Osu), Abokobi, Odumase-Krobo, Aburi, Akropong, Anum, Kyebi, Begoro, Nsaba, Abetifi and Kumasi. At the 1922 Synod, the first five Presbyteries were created: Ga and Adangme; Akuapem and Anum; Agona and Kotoku; Akyem and Okwawu; Asante and Asante Akyem. Mission stations were opened at Aburi, Larteh, Odumase, Abokobi, Kyebi, Gyadam, Kwahu, Asante, Anum as well as the Northern territories including Yendi and Salaga. Determined to succeed as an administrator, Clerk preached self-reliance and self-sufficiency, refusing to ask Missionary Societies abroad for funds This attitude was unpopular at home as the church was facing a financial crisis; while teachers could then earn good government salaries, Presbyterian pastors had to live on very modest stipends that the church could afford. Clerk's administration initially relied on sequestration for funding. He cooperated and collaborated with the Scottish missionaries after he had got over his initial suspicion of them. As Synod Clerk of the church, he emphasised the continued use of indigenous languages in church and school, and insisted on an unassuming and austere lifestyle. Clerk also attempted to forge unity between the Presbyterian church and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church with objective of forming a merger, the \\"United Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast\\" but his unification efforts proved futile. In the 1926 Synod meeting opened by N. T. Clerk, at Abetifi, the church polity voted to adopt the name ‚ÄòThe Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast‚Äô later to become ‚ÄòThe Presbyterian Church of Ghana‚Äô after the country gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1957. The change in name from the Basel Mission Church to the Presbyterian Church was in recognition to the complex history between the Scottish Presbyterian polity, the 1560 Scottish Reformation and the pivotal role the City of Basel in Switzerland played during the Protestant Reformation. After the Basel Missionaries were permitted to return to the Gold Coast in 1926, they cooperated with their Scottish colleagues, working together in the renamed and independent Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast. In that same year, 1926, Clerk returned to Basel as the church's delegate, and was able to dispel any notions in missionary circles that the Presbyterian Church had forgotten its roots and its debt to the Basel Mission. In this context, the church's logo is an expression of the \\"triple heritage\\" of missionary epochs in the formation of the Ghanaian Presbyterian church, representing the efforts of the Basel Europeans, the Moravian West Indians and the Scottish Presbyterians. This coming together of the three main missionary eras to forming one entity is captured in the church's motto, \\"That they all may be one.\\" The Synod took place biennially between 1918 and 1950, after which it was organised on a yearly basis. Furthermore, from 1918 to 2000, the Ghanaian Presbyterian Church operated the Synod system. At the 2000 Abetifi Synod, the Church switched to the General Assembly system, with the first General Assembly held in Navrongo in 2001. Nicholas T. Clerk also attended the International Missionary Council (IMC) conference from 14 to 20 September 1926 held in Le Zoute (Het Zoute) in the municipality of Knokke-Heist in the Belgian province of West Flanders, on the theme \\"The Christian Mission in Africa\\". The event brought together clergymen, missionary educationalists, medical experts and consultative members from the global academic community to discuss a variety of topics, relating to formal education and holistic training on the African continent, with topics encompassing \\"the Christian ideal in education, policy curriculum, the education of women and girls, the medium of instruction, languages and literature, and religious education.\\" The IMC ‚Äúencouraged ecumenical cooperation in support of world evangelization,\\" and had its roots in the 1910 World Mission Conference in Edinburgh ‚Äì a meeting that established the International Review of Mission, subsequently leading to the formation of the International Missionary Council in 1921 which was later incorporated into the World Council of Churches in 1961, as the Commission on World Mission and Evangelism. Later years After Clerk‚Äôs retirement in 1933, he split his time between Adawso and his home in Christiansborg (Osu) and continued to be active in church work. He often gave sermons at the local chapel, Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, in Osu as a locum tenens minister, even at the age of 90. The Government of the Gold Coast, on behalf of King George V and The Crown, awarded him a Certificate and a Badge of Honour, in June 1934 in recognition of his dedicated and distinguished service to his country and selfless contributions to education and nation building. The people of Buem invited him to visit them in 1937, a happy reunion he considered his \\"greatest moment\\". Personal life Anna Alice Meyer, Gold Coast, 1890s Anna Alice Meyer, Gold Coast, early 1930s Nicholas Timothy Clerk married Anna Alice Meyer (born on 13 March 1873), a homemaker and teacher from Christiansborg (Osu) on 26 February 1891 at Aburi. The wedding ceremony was officiated by Clerk's own father, the Rev. A. W. Clerk. Meyer was described as a \\"mulatress\\" and the daughter of the Rev. Carl Meyer, an 1850 seminarist at Christiansborg and a minister of the Basel Mission who belonged to the Meyer family that had origins in Denmark and was associated with a trading company on the Gold Coast. Anna Meyer's mother was a member of the Ga people of Accra and hailed from Agbajajoohe, a hamlet near the Christiansborg Castle in Osu. A descendant of the Euro-African mercantile class, Anna Meyer's probable ancestors included Hartvig Meyer, the Danish Governor of the Gold Coast from 11 September 1703 to 23 April 1704, and Peder Meyer, the Danish colonial merchant who settled on the Gold Coast and flourished between the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first decade of the nineteenth century. She was educated at the now defunct all- girls boarding school, Basel Mission Girls‚Äô School, established in 1857, at Abokobi near Accra. Anna Meyer had spent half-a-year in Odumase with her uncle, Carl Quist/Karl Kvist (1843-99) who had previously been a catechist and a housemaster at the pastor's seminary. Carl Quist's son (Meyer's cousin) was Emmanuel Charles Quist (1880 ‚Äì 1959), a barrister and judge who became the first African President of the Legislative Council from 1949 to 1951, Speaker of the National Assembly of the Gold Coast from 1951 to 1957, and Speaker of the National Assembly of Ghana from March 1957 to November 1957. Anna Meyer also stayed with the German missionary Kopps family. Several of the Abokobi school's enrolled pupils came from the Euro-African Christian families of Christiansborg in Osu though the school was open to all. In this regard, the Abokobi school was quite similar to the Christiansborg Castle School, opened in 1722, as well as the Cape Coast Castle School, established in the eighteenth century by the Reverend Thompson of the Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) associated with the Church of England. The castle schools were originally approved by the European Governors to baptise and educate the male Euro-African children of European men and Gold Coast African women. These children later became clerks and soldiers in the colonial civil service. Nicholas and Anna Clerk had nine children: Paulina Ruth (Mrs. Tagoe), Alexander Worthy (died in infancy), Carl Henry, Kate Hedwig (Mrs. Odonkor), Caroline Rebecca (Mrs. Quartey), Theodora Louisa (Mrs. Hall), Jane Elizabeth, Theodore Shealtiel and Matilda Johanna Clerk. Within a year of his retirement, Clerk‚Äôs wife, Anna Alice died suddenly on 2 August 1934 from a heart attack at their home in Adawso. Like his father, A. W. Clerk, N. T. Clerk was a polyglot; he read, wrote and spoke English, Ga, German and Twi fluently. Selected writings * Clerk, N. T. and Christaller, J. G.

A large crowd was present to mourn him at his funeral service held at the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church in Osu. His remains were interred in the Basel Mission quarter (section) of the Osu Cemetery (formerly known as the Christiansborg Civil Cemetery) in Accra. Memorials and legacy In appreciation of his contributions to education, the Government of the Gold Coast honoured him by naming two streets in Ghana after him: The Reverend Nicholas Timothy Clerk Road in Worawora and the Clerk Street in Osu, Accra. A boarding house, Clerk House at the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School (PRESEC, Legon) was named in his honour, in recognition of his selfless service to the church and the founding of a school that became synonymous with academic excellence and highly regarded alumni. The \\"N. T. Clerk Congregation\\" in the Volta Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana was named in his honour for the evangelical work he did in the Worawora area. A roundabout and a church in Buem were also named in Nicholas Clerk's honour. The Presbyterian Church today has instituted \\"Presbyterian Day\\" also \\"Ebenezer Day\\", a special Sunday designated in the church almanac to celebrate the arrival on 18 December 1828, selfless work and toil of the missionaries in the early years. The names of Nicholas Clerk and his father, Alexander Clerk appear on a commemorative plaque in the sanctuary of the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu, listing pioneering missionaries of the church, in recognition of their contributions to formal education and the growth of the Presbyterian faith in Ghana. Over the years, several of his children and grandchildren have made significant contributions to the development of Ghana in areas relating to architecture, church development, civil service, education, health services, print and broadcast journalism, medicine, natural sciences, public administration, public health, public policy and urban planning.

They debuted in the 24th edition of the \\"Cotton Club Parade\\" in spring 1934, a period at the beginning of the swing era, the post-Harlem Renaissance, a year after Prohibition, and the trough of the Great Depression. The chorus line's name often included a prefix reflecting the number of entertainers, such as \\"The Six Cotton Club Boys\\", \\"The 12 Cotton Club Boys\\", etc.  History  Some Cotton Club Boys alumni went on to become major influences in American arts and culture. Cholly Atkins, for example, contributed to Motown, musical theatre, and film. While the Cotton Club Boys were African-American, the Cotton Club maintained a whites-only policy for customers. = The original Cotton Club, Harlem (1923‚Äì1936) = The Cotton Club first opened in 1923 in Harlem on the 2nd floor of a building at 142nd Street and Lenox Avenue, close to Sugar Hill. The space had been formerly leased and operated by the boxer Jack Johnson as the Club Delux, an intimate supper club. Owney Madden, a bootlegger and gangster, took over the lease in 1923 after his release from Sing Sing. He was one among the syndicate owners that included beer baron Bill Duffy, boxer Tony Panica (John Francis Panica, known in the boxing world as Tommy Wilson), and Harry Block. Madden redecorated the space and changed the name to the Cotton Club. The Cotton Club sold liquor during Prohibition, which lasted until 1933. When the club opened, George \\"Big Frenchy\\" Demange was the manager. Walter Brooks, who brought Shuffle Along to Broadway in 1921, was the , or nominal owner. The Savoy Ballroom, which had a no-discrimination policy, was one block south at 596 Lenox Avenue. Smalls Paradise, which also had a no-discrimination policy, was seven blocks south and one avenue west at 2294 Seventh Avenue. The old Harlem Club at 142nd Street and Lenox Avenue reopened in May 1937 as the Plantation Club. = The new Cotton Club, Midtown (1936‚Äì1940) = Following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 and the Harlem riot of 1935, jazz venues began moving from Harlem to Midtown, around 52nd Street, and downtown. The new Cotton Club opened September 24, 1936, at Broadway and 48th Street, in the Great White Way section of the Theater District near Times Square. The Cotton Club was closed for the 1936 season while the owners planned the move. In the interim, some of the entertainers from the original club performed in productions billed as the \\"Cotton Club Revue\\" at the Harlem Alhambra. = Closing of the Cotton Club (1940) = The last show at the Cotton Club ran Saturday night, May 15, 1940, just before Madden left New York. It was reported in 1940 that the Cotton Club had suffered from competition from the World's Fair. Another likely impetus for the closing were the demands of Local 802, the New York chapter of the American Federation of Musicians, for back pay, especially salaries owed to Andy Kirk's band. The location subsequently opened as a nightclub called the Latin Quarter. = Influences on the Cotton Club Boys = *John Tiller (1854‚Äì1925): pioneer of precision dancing, influenced the Cotton Club Boys and Girls, who performed can-cans  Selected productions: Cotton Club Boys with the Cotton Club Revue  =Cotton Club Boys with the Cotton Club Revue = 1934 : 24th edition of Cotton Club Parade :: Opened March 23, 1934; opening night was largest show ever staged there; production ran for nine months, merging into fall edition :: Produced by Dan Healy (Daniel E.

L'offensive des Cent-Jours de 1918, y compris la bataille de l'Ailette Background After the Battle of Amiens, the forces of the Entente, led by Marshal Foch, planned a large-scale offensive on the German lines in France, the various lines of advance converging on Li√®ge in Belgium. Blocking the road to Paris between the Somme and Aisne, the Ailette and its canal linking the Oise and Aisne served as retrenchment for a number of soldiers of the Imperial German Army. Though it was a largely unknown battle of the Hundred Days Offensive during the First World War, the Ailette was the scene of fierce fighting between the French and German forces for its control from August to September 1918, before it returned to the French in October. The battle *August 15 - Having noticed that Von Eben's army is widely spread from Audignicourt to Morsain, Mangin decides to take advantage of it. So on August 17, at 5 am he attacks and seizes a position around Autr√®ches with the French 7th and 30 Army Corps. The next day at 6 o'clock in the evening, they assault 10 km of front and advance 2 km taking 2,000 prisoners while losing 60 killed and 300 wounded, having thus approached von Eben's first line. *August 19 - In the evening, Mangin holds a line through Bailly - Tracy-le-Val, west of Nampcel, Audignicourt, Vassens, Morsain, Nouvron, Vingre and Fontenoy. *20 August - On the right, north-west of Soissons, Tartiers is taken; in the center the infantrymen gained access to the plateau of Audignicourt and took Lombray and Bl√©rancourdelle while on the left, despite relentless resistance, the Germans retreat towards Ourscamp. During these maneuvers 8,000 prisoners are taken. Nampcel, Carlepont, and Caisnes are regained. *August 21 - With the support of tanks, Cuts is captured, lost and recaptured. Bl√©rancourt is taken after a hard fight. On the road to Noyon between Sampigny and Pontoise, a raid reached the Oise and gained the woods of Carlepont and Ourscamps by threatening to surround them across the Oise, and the rest of the Lassigny massif that Humbert (3rd army) will occupy bordering Divette. *August 22 - The 1st Bavarian Division hastened to the rescue and was attacked; by the afternoon, the French troops advance to the Oise up to Quierzy.

John Lowes became vicar of All Saints in 1596 and held his position for over 40 years. He was the main force that tried to make Catholicism fit into the wider vision of the Anglican prayer book. Ministers like Lowes were increasingly isolated, they were prosecuted as 'scandalous ministers', and their ritualistic behaviour was noted and used as evidence against them. The Rev. John Lowes was found guilty of witchcraft by Matthew Hopkins, the self-styled Witchfinder General, and as result in the autumn of 1645 he was hanged at Bury St Edmunds, along with 39 innocent men, women and children.

Gates (1903‚Äì1989) was an American artist, painter, art teacher and administrator who participated in the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture under the Treasury Department, creating the post office mural for Mebane, North Carolina, and a watercolor which was held at Fort Stanton in New Mexico. In addition, she has paintings held in several noted collections in the United States. Early life Margaret S. Casey was born in 1903 in Georgetown, Washington, D. C. to Antonia L. (n√©e Harvey) and James F. Casey. She studied art privately with Bertha Perry, and continued her education between 1924 and 1926 at the Corcoran School of Art. Casey then studied at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center under the tutelage of Henry Varnum Poor. Career Beginning her career as a commercial artist, Casey worked in 1928 and 1929, before deciding to continue her education with Charles Law Watkins at the Phillips Memorial Gallery School in 1931. While studying at the Phillips Gallery, Casey met the painter Robert Franklin Gates and the two were married on January 7, 1933. That same year, she was appointed to the teaching faculty of the Phillips Gallery School, where she would serve for the next thirteen years. She also worked as the executive secretary of the gallery. Between 1934 and 1941, a group of artists, including the Gates, Mitchell Jamieson and Prentiss Taylor began a series of trips as part of a commission by the Treasury Department to the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 1936, Gates produced a series of vivid watercolors, including The White Gate, which featured the decorative patterns formed by wrought iron, ornamental gates against the backdrop of the sun, sand, and native population of St. Thomas. Primarily, she worked in watercolor, oil and tempra, specializing in figures and industrial scenes. In 1939, Gates won a commission in the competition for the post office mural of Mebane, North Carolina. She executed and installed, Landscape‚ÄîTobacco Curing in 1941. The original design had planned a night scene of workers in a curing barn, but in the final painting, the portrayal is depicted during daylight hours. The mural carries the central theme of family and shows a man and a young boy, walking in tandem to work on the tobacco farm. That same year, Live Oaks, a watercolor by Gates was purchased by the government for the federal hospital of Fort Stanton, New Mexico. In the 1940s and 1950s Gates exhibited regularly. She had works exhibited in the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Bignou Gallery in New York City, Cincinnati Art Museum's Critics Choice Exhibition, the National Gallery of Art, The Phillips Collection, the Richmond Bi-Annual, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and with the Society of Washington Painters and Sculptors. With the latter organization, she won a prize in 1945. The following year, she exhibited for Pepsi Cola and had a solo show at the Whyte Gallery in Washington, D. C. In 1948, she mounted an exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Over the same decade, Gates wrote articles on art for publications, such as The Washington Spectator, and had a regular column in the journal Right Angle, of the American University, called \\"The People vs. Art\\". From 1948 to 1953, Gates worked at the Watkins Gallery at American University and beginning in 1950, worked as an administrative assistant in the Madeira School. In 1955, Gates and her husband divorced, though she continued to live in the house they had purchased together in McLean, Virginia. She retired in 1969 and in 1980, moved to Mitchellville, Maryland. Death and legacy Gates died on November 4, 1989, in Mitchellville, Maryland. Gates' papers were donated by her estate to the Archives of American Art.

The father of series co-creator Nathalie Basteyns stayed at the hotel 10 years before the show was created, and it made an impression upon him. Basteyns and Kaat Beels conceived the idea for the series immediately after this, when the child murders of serial killer Marc Dutroux were still fresh in people's minds. They elected to add a supernatural element to the story to set it apart from other similar neo-noir dramas currently airing. Lynn Van Royen, who portrays teenager Kato, was 28 and pregnant with her second child during the shoot. The creators and producers hope to make the series an anthology, with a different dead character in each season. A second season was announced in November 2017. Sanne Nuyens, Bert Van Dael and Roel Mondelaers will return as writers. For the second season, the writers received a subsidy of 25,000 euros from the Flemish Audiovisual Fund. In February 2019, it was announced that the city of Bruges and production house De Mensen had reached an agreement to film the second season in the village of Zeebrugge, a port on the coast of Belgium. Filming began in summer 2019 with Gene Bervoets cast in a main role. The second season will feature an all-new cast and storyline, albeit with a similar premise of a murder victim trying to solve his own death. It is expected to return in 2021. In December 2019, it was reported that Bervoets was injured during filming. He was treated at the hospital and released the same day. Reception Hotel Beau S√©jour has been well received by critics, with particular praise for Lynn Van Royen's portrayal of the murdered Kato. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail compared it favorably to the first season of HBO's True Detective, calling it \\"a remarkably textured, slow-burning and compelling murder mystery.\\" The Los Angeles Times called Hotel Beau S√©jour a \\"worthy new addition to a crowded streaming field of moody European crime thrillers.\\" American horror master Stephen King praised the series on Twitter, calling Hotel Beau S√©jour \\"Eccentric, brilliant, and strangely touching.

When discovered near Salmon Gums in 1977, it was thought to be the extinct Caladenia cristata, but when C. cristata was found near Miling, the Salmon Gums discovery was renamed C. voigtii.  Description  Caladenia voigtii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect leaf, 50‚Äì150 mm long and about 6 mm wide. Usually only one greenish-yellow flower with dark reddish markings and 20‚Äì30 mm long, 10‚Äì20 mm wide is borne on a stalk 80‚Äì200 mm high. The dorsal sepal is erect, 14‚Äì18 mm long and 2‚Äì3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 14‚Äì18 mm wide, 3‚Äì4 mm long and turn stiffly downwards. The petals are 10‚Äì15 mm long, about 2 mm wide and spread horizontally or somewhat downwards. The labellum is 10‚Äì12 mm long, 8‚Äì12 mm wide, greenish with faint red lines and heart-shaped with a small, dark red, down-curved tip. There is a dense band of tall, red-tipped calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to October.  Taxonomy and naming  When discovered near Salmon Gums in 1977, it was thought to be Caladenia cristata which had been considered extinct since 1923, however when C. cristata was located near Miling, the present orchid was recognised as a new species. It was first formally described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from the Salmon Gums specimen and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (voigtii) honours Don Voigt who found the first specimen.  Distribution and habitat  The mohawk spider orchid is found between Bremer Bay and Balladonia in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in a variety of habitats including on granite outcrops and near salt lakes.

The Attorney general (Rigsadvokaten) is based at No. 16. Both buildings were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 6 April 1969. History =The Plessen Mansion= The Plessen Mansion The Plessen family constructed a town mansion at the site in the 18th century. The Plassen Mansion (Danish: Det Plessenske Pal√¶) was a two-storey Baroque style building. The building was later known as the Knuthske Hotel (The Knuth Hotel). In 1779 it was acquired by a merchant named Lycke. It was later purchased by Caspar Peter B√ºgel. The next owner, Jens Lund, another merchant, constructed a couple of warehouses around the corner in Ny Vestergade. A free mason's lodge, Zorobabel af Nordstjernen, was based in the building in the 1790s. In the middle of the 19th century it had fallen into despair =The new building= The two properties in c. 1899 The neglected building was acquired by Alphonse Cassabadan who had recently retired from his position as head chef for king Christian VIII. Cassabadan commissioned the architect Harald Conrad Stilling to redevelop the site into two separate apartment buildings in 1851-1852. Stilling added two extra floors. Cassabadan also established a tavern in the basement of No. 18. The theologian N.F.S. Grundtvig and ballet master August Bournonville both lived in the building from 1852 to 1855. Count H. A. Reventlow-Criminil (1798-1869) was also a resident in No. 16 in 1853. George Quaade, who had been appointed to Minister of Education on 1 July 1864, lived at No. 18 in 1865. The publisher and Venstre politician Christen Berg (1829-1891), lived in the ground floor of No. 18 in 1885-1886.

He was the joint owner of the ribbon factory Christensen og Hansen. The company had a shop on √òstergade. Christensen undertook a major renovation of the building. The Christensen family's own home, a 15-room apartment, was located on the second floor. The two daughters Gerda and Ellen Christensen lived in the apartment until 1963 and left it with all its furnishings to the National Museum of Denmark. =Recent history= The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 6 April 1969.

They are six bays wide. Both buildings have a balcony at each of the outer bays on the first floor and No. 16 has an additional balcony in front of the two central bays on the top floor. The interior of the two gateways are decorated with a copy of Bertel Thorvaldsen's Alexander frieze. The 35-metre-long and one-metre-tall relief frieze was originally commissioned for the popal Palazzo del Quirinale in 1912 in connection with Napoleon's planned visit to the city. It was completed in just three months. The walls of the staircase at No. 18 are richly decorated with murals created for Rudolph Christensen in the 1890s by C.W. Juulmann & S√∏n in N√∏rregade.

The technique has applications in some types of sequencing and hybridization probing where having only one of the two complementary strands is required. Methodology Asymmetric PCR differs from regular PCR by the excessive amount of primers for a chosen strand. Due to the slow (arithmetic) amplification later in the reaction (after the limiting primer has been used up) extra cycles of PCR are required. A modification on this process, known as Linear-After-The-Exponential-PCR (LATE-PCR), uses a limiting primer with a higher melting temperature than the excess primer to maintain reaction efficiency as the limiting primer concentration decreases mid-reaction. Applications Asymmetric PCR can be used to form single stranded DNA from double stranded DNA, which is then used for DNA sequencing in the mutagenesis method. Single stranded DNA is also important for aptamer generation.

All these graphs can be represented in any Resource Description Framework (RDF) serialization formats including JSON-LD or Turtle. The adoption of SHACL may influence the future of linked data.Web-based graph technology is on the rise. Here is why. World Wide Web Consortium published the following SHACL Specifications: * SHACL (W3C Technical Recommendation) is the main document, defining the features of SHACL Core and its extension mechanism called SHACL- SPARQL. SHACL Core defines the basic syntax and structure of shapes, constraints, the built-in kinds of constraints, and how to link shapes to data nodes. SHACL-SPARQL defines how to express constraints that are not covered by the built-in constraint kinds. * SHACL Advanced Features (W3C Working Group Note), the most recent version of which is maintained by the SHACL Community Group defines support for SHACL Rules, a powerful feature (inspired by SPIN rules) for data transformations, inferences and mappings based on data shapes. Also includes extensions of SHACL-SPARQL such as user-defined functions. * SHACL JavaScript Extensions (W3C Working Group Note) defines how JavaScript can be used to express constraints, rules, functions and other features. This covers similar ground as SHACL-SPARQL, but using JavaScript as its execution language. * SHACL Compact Syntax (SHACL Community Group Report).

By the end of 2019 many commercial RDF database and framework vendors announced support for at least SHACL Core. Some of the open source tools listed in the report are: * dotNetRDF - a .NET Framework online service * pySHACL - an open source SHACL validator library for command line use written in Python * shaclex - a Scala implementation of both SHACL and ShEx * TopBraid SHACL API - an open source implementation of SHACL Validation by TopQuadrant, based on Apache Jena. The same code is used in the TopBraid commercial products. However, commercial products also support SHACL Advanced Features. SHACL Playground is a free SHACL validation service implemented in JavaScript. Eclipse rdf4j is an open source Java framework for processing RDF data. It now supports SHACL validation.

Originally a resident of Louisiana, Covington was active in Mississippi and recorded in the late-1920s and 1930s, presumably under various names such as Blind Ben Covington, Ben Curry, and Memphis Ben. He also occasionally performed alongside Big Joe Williams, King Solomon Hill, and Speckled Red.  Biography  According to blues historian Gayle Jean Wardlow, Covington was originally from the town of Arcadia in northern Louisiana. Covington, born Benjamin Curry, was possibly the same Curry who was drafted during the First World War; his birth date is listed as April 19, 1890 in Yalobusha County, Mississippi. Whatever the case, Covington moved to Birmingham, Alabama in the mid-1920s, but traveled frequently to Mississippi and Chicago to perform on street corners. Big Joe Williams remembered Covington: he described him as \\"bogus blind\\", hence Covington's nickname, for pretending to be blind to earn more money while playing on the streets. The two musicians were still playing together as late as 1933 at the Century of Progress Expo in Chicago. Blues experts Kip Lornell and David Evans are in agreement that Covington is the same musician who recorded under the aliases Ben Curry and Memphis Ben. The researchers based their conclusions on the similar playing styles and the selected material. Another blues writer, Paul Oliver also determined Covington was the same Ben Curry who recorded a cover version of Speckled Red's song \\"The Dirty Dozen\\". For recording sessions, Covington played an instrument called a \\"mandolin-banjo\\" and also provided accompaniment on the harmonica. In September 1928, Covington traveled to Chicago to record under the moniker \\"Bogus\\" Ben Covington for Paramount Records. If he is indeed Memphis Ben, Covington entered Vocalion Records' studio in Memphis on November 28 to complete two unissued sides. The Memphis Ben alias may have been devised by Harry Charles, a talent scout who sometimes gave blues musicians different names to avoid contract disputes. In October 1929, Covington recorded again for Vocalion, this time with the alias Blind Ben Covington. After a two year recording drought, he was rediscovered by Paramount Records. He was invited to a session, credited to performers Ben Curry, which included Marshall Owens, the Famous Bluejay Singers of Birmingham, and King Solomon Hill, the latter an old friend of Covington's. Not much else is known about Covington after his final recording session. He is believed to have moved to Pennsylvania where he died in 1935.

The protest resulted from conflicts between the Met and the Harlem art community after the Met's decision to exclude black artists and the Harlem community from an exhibit about Harlem, as well as from racism and anti-Semitism within both the exhibition and exhibition catalogue.  Background  = Harlem on My Mind = Met curator and director Thomas Hoving had planned a three-month long multimedia exhibition called Harlem on My Mind intended to highlight the history of Harlem since 1900. The exhibition consisted of floor-to-ceiling introductory photomurals, and then photographs of various sizes depicting life in Harlem, but no artwork by black artists. The accompanying catalog included a term paper written by Harlem resident and recent graduate of Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City) Candice Van Ellison containing copious anti-semitic and anti-Irish slurs, and was subsequently pulled from publication by Hoving. Portions of the essay can be found quoted within Bridget R. Cooks' 2011 work Exhibiting Blackness: African Americans and the American Art Museum (University of Massachusetts Press).  Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC)  The BECC was organized in January 1969 by a group of 75 African American artists in direct response to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \\"Harlem on My Mind\\" exhibit. The co-chairmen at the time of creation were Benny Andrews, Henri Ghent, and Edward Taylor.  Defacement  \\"Christ with a Staff,\\" by an unknown follower of Rembrandt. Third quarter, 17th century. Metropolitan Museum of Art. On January 16, 1969, ten paintings were defaced in response to the Harlem on My Mind exhibit. Small \\"H's\\" (as large as five inches tall) were scratched mostly into varnish covering the paintings, but in one case, into the actual pigments. None went through the canvases, and all paintings were successfully repaired. The vandal(s) weren't caught, and BECC denounced the vandalism. = List of defaced works = * Follower of Rembrandt.

Watson Library's Digital Archives. Mayor Lindsay, despite being a friend of Hoving's, criticized the Museum for its choices as racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Irish, and anti-Puerto Rican, later threatening to withhold financial support from the Museum if the catalogue were not removed. Hoving included two disclaimers in the catalogue warning of the racism and anti-Semitism within, and Random House (the publisher) included these in bookstore copies, as well as issuing their own apology. State Commissioner of Human Rights Robert Magnum asked that the show be closed \\"until it reflects a more accurate record of the aspirations, achievements and goals of the black people of New York.\\" = Art criticism = Art critics were divided in their responses. Many argued whether the Museum should even include exhibits of \\"sociological documentation\\", and if that should be considered art or not, or where such an exhibit should be included. Then The New York Times art critic John Canaday admitted he knew little of Harlem culture, and what he did know had been influenced by common perception of black culture as being a modernization and extension of \\"plantation\\" culture, concluding that he was not qualified to judge a show like \\"Harlem on My Mind\\". By March 1969, the exhibit was reported to still be drawing large crowds. Almost 75,000 people visited the show during its opening week, and hundreds of thousands more before it closed later in March. Throughout, picketing continued. = Artists and activists = Artist, writer, and activist Sabra Moore was one of the many artists and activists to join demonstrations against the exhibit. Moore wrote a detailed description of one of the demonstrations in front of the Museum during that time.

Her artwork is based on re-interpreting family, social, and natural history through the form of artist's books, sewn and constructed sculptures and paintings, and installations. She was a member of the Heresies Collective, the Women's Caucus for Art, and was a collaborator of the art collective RepoHistory. Moore is known for her large-scale, collaborative exhibitions of women's artwork including Views by Women Artists (1982), and the collaborative shows Reconstruction Project (1984) and Connections Project/Conexus (1987). She has exhibited her artwork widely since 1969 including 18 solo exhibitions and over 130 group exhibitions. She has authored two books, Petroglyphs: Ancient Language/Sacred Art (Clear Light Publishers 1997) and Openings: A Memoir from the Women‚Äôs Art Movement, New York City 1970-1992 (New Village Press 2016). Moore also worked for thirty years as a freelance photo editor for New York-based publishers. Her artist's books can be found in several museum collections including those of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in NYC. The feature-length documentary film The Heretics (2011) includes her artistic and political work. She currently lives in Abiqui√∫, New Mexico.  Early life  Sabra Moore grew up in Commerce, Texas. Her father was a railroad engineer for the Cotton Belt, and her mother was a first-grade school teacher. Her father was also an organizer for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The labor meetings she witnessed as a child, where workers came together to stand up for their rights, influenced her own activism. Her first trips outside of Texas were to attend strikes. Moore grew up around the tradition of quilt making and believes her grandmother's textile crafts have influenced her own creativity.  Education  Moore studied at the University of Texas in Austin in their liberal arts honors program called Plan II and graduated with a BA cum laude in 1964. Moore was a finalist for a Woodrow Wilson scholarship.  Peace Corps in Guinea, Africa, 1964-1966  Moore joined the Peace Corps in 1964 and lived in Guinea, West Africa for two years. She taught English at √âcole Technique in N‚ÄôZ√©r√©kor√©, Guinea. A year after returning from Guinea, Moore was awarded a Fulbright fellowship to study African art at the Centre for West African Studies at the University of Birmingham in England. A few months into the fellowship, she returned to the United States.  Life in New York City  Moore moved to New York City in 1966 and began studying at the Brooklyn Museum Art School. Her work was first exhibited as part of the group show Fifteen Artists curated by Henry Ghent at the Brooklyn Museum's Community Gallery in 1969. She taught English as a second language at Columbia University and taught an after-school children's arts class at the Brooklyn Museum while painting and attending anti-war demonstrations in her free time. She joined the Committee of Returned Volunteers (CRV) and continued protesting the war in Vietnam and Gulf Oil in Angola. Moore joined the Women Artists in Revolution (WAR). She also worked as a counselor for Women's Services, an abortion clinic sponsored by Judson Memorial Church and the Clergy Consultation Service. After she left the clinic, Moore worked with fellow artist Georgia Matsumoto as a freelance house painter for seven years. She continued creating artwork independently and attended meetings for the NYC/ Women's Caucus for Art. She also contributed to the publication Heresies, a New York-based feminist journal on art and politics produced by the Heresies Collective. =Counselor for Women's Services= From 1970-1972, Moore worked as a counselor for the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion in Manhattan's Upper East Side, a service founded in 1967 to help women find medical practitioners who would perform the procedure. Moore had experienced an abortion herself when she was 21 years old. =Heresies Collective= From 1979-1991, Moore was a member of the Heresies Collective, which published Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics from 1977 to 1992. Moore's involvement began when she started meeting regularly as part of the editorial collective of the Heresies Magazine Issue #13: Earthkeeping / Earthshaking: Feminism & Ecology 1979. She later became a member of the Mother Collective. =NYC/ Women's Caucus for Art= Moore was President of the Women's Caucus for Art from 1980-1982. She coordinated Views By Women Artists, sixteen independently curated shows in sixteen different venues showing the artworks of over 450 women artists. Moore curated a show called Pieced Work. =Women Artists Visibility Event, 1984= Moore helped fellow artist Betsy Damon and President of the WCA Annie Shaver- Crandell organize a June 14, 1984 protest against the unequal representation of women and minorities in the New York Museum of Modern Art's exhibition An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture. For the event, Moore built and painted a small wooden replica of the museum entitled Model MoMA. Marchers wrote their names on slips of paper and placed them inside the model in order to show their symbolic inclusion in the museum. Though there was no official name of the protest, it is known as the Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.). Moore, Damon, and Shaver-Crandell were coordinators of the event, and the Heresies Collective, the Women's Interart Center, and the New York Feminist Art Institute became cosponsors. Slogans used in the protest included ‚ÄúThe Museum Opens, But Not To Women Artists,‚Äù ‚ÄúLet MoMA Know,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Visibility Event.‚Äù =Other organizational involvement= Other organizations Moore was involved with during her time in New York included the Women's Action Coalition (WAC), a feminist direct-action organization founded in 1992 to fight discrimination against women, and Repo History, an artists collective that produced collaborative art projects highlighting the histories of working class men and women, minorities and children. =Professional photo editing= Moore worked as a freelance photo editor for thirty years in NYC for publishers, including Doubleday, Harper Collins, American Heritage, and Random House. She was the sole picture editor for over 35 books including Francoise Gilot's Matisse and Picasso, Benita Eisler's O‚ÄôKeeffe and Stieglitz: An American Romance, Robert Stern's Pride of Place, and Norma Mailer's Portrait of Picasso as a Young Man. Moore was the principal photo editor for Through Indian Eyes (Readers Digest) and Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth. She was the photo editor for five years of a magazine published by American Heritage Publishers, I&T;: The American Heritage of Invention and Technology.  The Heretics (2011)  Moore's artistic and political work is included in the feature film The Heretics. The Heretics focuses on the Heresies Collective as a microcosm of the larger movement at the time in which thousands of small, private groups of women were meeting together and devising strategies to fight for women's rights.  Artistic themes  In her artwork, Moore explores the relationship between the personal and the political. Her work is based on re-interpreting family, social, and natural history through the form of artist's books, sewn and constructed sculptures and paintings, and installations. She has referred to her work as a ‚Äúkind of personal archeology‚Äù explaining that she sees herself as a literate granddaughter who has synthesized the quilt making and storytelling traditions of her rural grandmothers into new forms. She is committed to the idea of placing artwork within a social context and has consistently worked with feminist and political art groups to do that. Her role as a long-time activist in the women's art movement demonstrates her dedication to both art and activism. She has organized several large-scale women's exhibitions in New York City, Brazil, Canada, and New Mexico on themes of social concern. Moore's current work is in the form of boats, cages, leaves or poles, and relates to issues of water and trees.

Encaustic painting at Saint Catherine's Monastery, Mount Sinai The Acts of Thaddeus (Greek: Œ†œÅŒ±ŒæŒµ·Ω∂ÃÄœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒòŒ±Œ¥Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒøœÖ) is a Greek document written between 544 and which purports to describe correspondence between King Abgar V of Edessa and Jesus, which results in Jesus' disciple Thaddeus going to Edessa.  Authorship  Most scholars now believe that the Acts of Thaddeus was written in the seventh century at the earliest. Nicolotti dates it between 609 and , when the Image of Edessa was brought to Constantinople. Palmer dates it to the seventh century, and had specifically suggested between 629‚Äì630, although this has been rejected by Angelo Gramaglia. Mirkovic notes that it is typically dated after the public appearance of the Image of Edessa in 544, and considers the iconoclasm controversy of the eighth century as the most probably context. Writers frequently confuse the Greek Acts of Thaddeus with the Syriac Doctrine of Addai. It is generally agreed to be a later development of the tradition described in the Legend of Abgar told by Eusebius.  Contents  The Acts of Thaddeus describes correspondence between King Abgar V of Edessa and Jesus, which results in Jesus' disciple Thaddeus going to Edessa and performing miracles there including the healing of Abgar.  Purpose  The Acts of Thaddeus shows significant development in the Abgar tradition since the earlier Doctrine of Addai, placing much more emphasis on the miraculous character of the Image of Edessa, while minimizing the significance of human actors. Aquilina regards it as doctrinally orthodox and unconcerned for historical accuracy. William Schoedel asserts that the author of the Acts of Thaddeus confused the apostle Thaddeus with a different Syrian Christian figure named Addai.  Reception  The Acts of Thaddeus was included in the biblical canon of Gregory of Tatev, although no biblical manuscripts have been found which include it. Modern scholars have found it to be significant for its descriptions of the sacraments of initiation. The Acts of Thaddeus is often studied by those seeking to associate the Image of Edessa with the Shroud of Turin; Nicolotti considers their interpretations quite biased. In 2014, Stephen Andrew Missick wrote a script for a film entitled \\"The Acts of the Apostle Thaddeus: The Birth of Christianity in Assyria\\" based on the Acts of Thaddeus and other ancient sources.

From ancient times, India was the source of nearly all the world's known diamonds, and until the discovery of diamonds in Brazil in 1726, India was the only place where diamonds were mined. India has not been a major diamond-producing country since the 1700s, but diamond mining continues. In 2013, India mined 37,515 carats of diamonds, from one industrial-scale mine and many artisanal mines; this was less than one-tenth of one percent of the world production of 132.9 million carats.World Mineral Production 2009-2013, British Geological Survey. History =Ancient times= The process of diamonds being used for drilling ornamental beads dates back to 2nd millennium BC. Archaeologists working in Yemen have excavated beads with evidences of diamond drilling from 1200 BC to 1st century AD from the site of Hajar ar Rayhani, while double diamond drilling from 7th century BC, archaeologists speculate that the beads were imported from India since no fragmented beads were found. The double diamond drill technique was present in western india prior to 600 BC (7th century BC). Diamond mining as an industry appears to have originated between 700 and 500 BCE in India.James Remington McCarthy, Fire in the Earth (New York: Harper, 1942) 21. Accounts of early Indian diamond mining that reached Europe were often mixed with myths. Around 400 BCE, the Greek physician Ctesias published Indika, a compilation of travellers' tales about India (he himself had never been to India). He described incredibly rich diamond deposits guarded by griffins. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (79 CE), correctly described diamonds being washed from river gravel in India. The Arthashastra of Kautilya mentions diamond trade in India.Lee 2006, p. 685 Buddhist works dating from the 4th century BC describe the diamond as a well- known and precious stone but do not mention the details of diamond cutting.Dickinson 2001, pp. 1‚Äì2 1999 =Medieval period (1200 to 1800 CE)= Diamonds were reported from numerous places across India, but most of the diamond mining took place by placer mining in the drainages of the Pennar and Krishna rivers in modern Andhra Pradesh state. Placer mining took place along the Krishna River for 300 km below Sangram. The most intensive mining was in a 60 km zone along the river, from the Kollur Mine to Paritala. This area was the source of many legendary gems, including the Koh-i-Noor, Nizam, Hope, Regent, Great Mogul, and Orlov diamonds.Detailed Information Dossier on Diamond in India, 2011, India Geological Survey, p.22, 124. India's unique status as a producer of diamonds continued to fascinate Europeans. Marco Polo travelled along the coast of India in 1292, and recorded tales he heard about diamonds being found in deep mountain valleys made nearly inaccessible by heat, lack of water, and venomous snakes.Marc Polo, The Travels of Marco Polo. The French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier visited the Krishna River diggings in 1665, and estimated that about 60,000 people were mining diamonds. The town of Karwan, near the fortress city of Golkonda, now a suburb of Hyderabad, became the world's largest diamond-cutting and diamond-trading centre. Golconda was not close to diamond mines, but owed its status as a diamond centre to its location on a major trade route from the mines to the south and east. The diamonds became known as Golconda Diamonds, and in Europe, the word Golconda came to mean a place of great wealth. India continued to be the world's leading source - and nearly the only source - of diamonds until diamonds were discovered in Brazil in 1726. At first, Brazilian diamonds were reputed to be inferior, and did not command as high a price as the Indian article. To obtain better prices, Portuguese traders began shipping Brazilian diamonds through Goa, and then to Europe to be sold as genuine Golconda diamonds. Indian diamond mining declined rapidly in the 1700s, due to a combination of exhaustion of known deposits and competition from Brazil.James Remington McCarthy, Fire in the Earth (New York: Harper, 1942) 21. Diamond mining in the Panna region began around 1675 CE, during the rule of Chhatrasal, the Bundela ruler.[https://books.google.com/books?id=fghQhiowlycC&pg;=PA52&dq;=panna+diamond+mining+chhatrasal&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj_i4vD97rZAhWmyoMKHQA1DUgQ6AEISjAG#v=onepage&q;=panna%20diamond%20mining%20chhatrasal&f;=false Between History and Legend: Status and Power in Bundelkhand, Ravindra K.

The deposit is in a kimberlite or lamproite pipe 6.5 ha in area, and yields 10 carats to the ton. Mining is done by an open pit, which was 85 m deep as of 2011. Exploration drilling has established that the pipe continues down to at least 330 m.Detailed Information Dossier on Diamond in India, 2011, India Geological Survey, p.50-53. The mine is owned by the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), employs 199 people, and has a productive capacity of 84,000 carats per year. The mine began regular production in 1967, and to date, has yielded slightly more than a million carats of diamonds.Diamond mining project, Panna, NMDC, accessed 28 Mar. 2017. There are also numerous artisanal-scale mines. In the Panna mining district, the Madhya Pradesh government leases 8√ó8 m plots to individuals, who wash the gravel for diamonds. All diamonds found are required to be handed over to the government diamond office in Panna, which markets the gems, and gives the sales proceeds to the finders, less taxes and 11.5 % royalty. In 2016, there were officially 952 artisanal mines, which yielded 835 carats of diamonds. However, there is an unknown number of small illegal mines, and an unknown amount of diamonds sold on the black market.Neeraj Santoshi, \\"Panna illegal mining rampant in India's only diamond-producing region\\", Hindustan Times, 27 Jan. 2017.

Charlotte Vanhove (10 September 1771 ‚Äì 11 April 1860) was a comedy stage actress from France. She is most often described as a beautiful blonde woman who enjoyed painting, drawing, and the theater. She devoted much of her life to the arts, particularly stage acting and is known for writing several plays and books.  Life  Charlotte Vanhove was born in 1771 in The Hague, Dutch Republic. She was the daughter of actor Charles-Joseph Vanhove and actress Adnree Coche. =Early career= Being the daughter of two stage actors, Charlotte was destined for the theater. At the age of fourteen, she began studying and working at the acting house called The Comedie-Francaise in 1785, the rules of this establishment allowing for female actors to be a part of the acting troupe. In that same year, she took her first role in a play called Iphigenia , which was created by Jean Racine, the role being that of title character Iphigenia. A few years later, Charlotte married a violinist, but shortly after the wedding, Charlotte asked for and was granted a divorce. At this time in history, the French Revolution was just starting, which caused panic among French citizens. On the night of 2 September 1793, Charlotte was arrested along with twelve other actors of the French Theater, all of which were loyal to the French monarch. She, along with the twelve other actors, were arrested on charges of suspicion shortly after their performance of Pamela on 1 August, which officials believed was seditious towards the Crown. Charlotte and the twelve other actors were kept at the Prison Saints-Pelagie until they were released five months later. = Post-Revolution career = After her release, Charlotte continued to perform comedy. In 1798, she and her father began purchasing a large estates starting with the Malgouverne in Bruony, France. Next, the pair bought the Governance and its Park which was put up for sale by previous owner Ribbing Frederick. Soon after, Charlotte met Joseph Talma, one of the most famous stage actors of her time. At the time, Talma was married to dancer Julie Carreau. Even though Talma was famous, he had amassed a significant amount of debt which his wife, Julie, took on. After their meeting, Charlotte and Talma started to grow close until they official began a life together. Julie, who was alone, half-ruined, and disgraced, accepted a divorce. Talma and Charlotte officially married in 1802. During their marriage, Talma began expensive renovations to the two estates which Charlotte had just bought with her father, renovations which he initially paid for. Not long after the wedding, Talma took on a mistress with whom he had three children. She died soon after the last child was born and Talma took a new mistress. Despite the financial assistance of Talma's close friend, Napoleon Bonaparte, his debts began to pile up. Charlotte then began to take charge of the households and soon asks for a divorce. When her request is denied, she leaves the theater and is able to recover a sizable portion of her money that Talma spent. Charlotte, with her recouped funds, moved into a small hotel where she was surrounded by gardens and friends. = Later life = Shortly after moving into the small hotel, Charlotte began to devoted her life to the arts once again. She started to paint and draw, but most of all she wrote. She is known for writing Edmonton and Juliette in 1820, The Castle of Valmire in 1821, The Venetian in 1822, The Guilty Bride in 1824 and The Theatrical Act in 1835. Still married by law, Charlotte and Talma had little contact even though she took care of his three children. She paid their expenses and when they were sent to the Fontenay-sous Bois, she paid for that too. When Talma died in 1826, she married the Conte de Chalot and became Countess Vanhove. The Count, who was a lifelong close friend with whom she enjoyed long walks and conversation with, died soon after their marriage.

Rapid Attack development The ‚òñBishop*45 Side Pawn variation is one of the Rapid Attack (ÊÄ•Êà¶ ky≈´sen) subvariations of Side Pawn Capture that starts with bishop trade initiated by White (that is, 8...Bx88+ 9.Sx88). It is named after the bishop drop position ‚Äì the 45 square ‚Äì that White makes three moves after the bishop trade. This Side Pawn Capture substrategy was popular in the early 1980s. Much of the theory was advanced from the games (in 1978-1979) and analysis of Koji Tanigawa. After much research, this variation is thought to be unsound at the professional level since perfect play by Black leads to an unfavorable position for White. However, at the amateur level, the complex variation may be difficult for both sides to navigate giving winning chances for either player. The position is reached by the following the Side Pawn Capture opening with 1.P-76 P-34 2.P-26 P-84 3.P-25 P-85 4.G-78 G-34 5.P-24 Px24 6.Rx24 P-86 7.Px86 Rx86 8.Rx34 and, subsequently, veering into the Rapid Attack lines with 8...Bx88+ 9.Sx88 to reach the position shown in the adjacent digram.

The scene has been described by its producers and music journalists to be a satirical take on electronic dance music and useless, throwaway internet content. One critic, Audra Schroeder, categorized it as an in-joke that is \\"deconstructing and reshaping memes and popular music, recontextualizing the sacred texts of millennial chat rooms.\\" Origins In a January 2014 interview, DJ Kevin Wang suggested weird SoundCloud has \\"been around in the last one to two years,\\" but started to gain much popularity the previous year through electronic dance music internet blogs. Weird SoundCloud producer Ideaot suggested that some in the phenomenon came from the YouTube Poop scene. Another producer in the community, DJ @@ (AT-AT), reasoned producers joining the scene \\"want to express their musicality,\\" \\"see it as a more mature form of YouTube Poop,\\" or are \\"just looking for recognition on social media sites.\\" AT-AT said that it was \\"a fun thing to do, and after I stopped making \\"proper\\" music I felt I needed a bit of an outlet for my creativity. The fact that people enjoyed it and/or treated it as \\"A travesty\\" (Direct quote from one of my tracks) spurs me on.\\" Characteristics Weird SoundCloud is a mash-up and parody music genre labeled by journalist Audra Schroeder as an in-joke that is \\"deconstructing and reshaping memes and popular music, recontextualizing the sacred texts of millennial chat rooms.\\" Most tracks range from around 30 seconds to one minute in length. The people who make weird SoundCloud are known as SoundClowns, a term coined by producer Dicksoak. Ideaot described the weird SoundCloud community as \\"largely just people who are friends with each other.\\" Noisey critic Ryan Bassil spotlight the variety of music coming out of the weird SoundCloud landscape: \\"One minute you could be listening to the Seinfeld theme reimagined as an aneurysm inducing dubstep corker, the next, you're recovering from hearing a version of Tenacious D's \\"Tribute\\" that's akin to having a stroke.\\"Bassil, Ryan (March 9, 2015). \\"Welcome To Weird Soundcloud, Where the Seinfeld Theme is a Dubstep Banger\\".

Bassil analyzes that the tracks \\"often take the past and repurpose it into something that, although not altogether useful, sounds fresh and reflective of the abstract, confusing panoramic that encapsulates the modern internet.\\" Bassil compared the lexicon of SoundClown's track titles to that of Reddit and Twitter users. According to Dicksoak, most works of the style are critiques of EDM or \\"are just uploaded because they sound funny.\\" However, Bassil disagreed, writing that there are also many tracks that keep repurposing a certain meme, such as \\"mom's spaghetti\\" or the re-use of vocals from recordings by hip hop group Death Grips. He describe the scene's re-use of memes as a satirical take on pointless online content that is only on the internet to \\"do nothing other than fill the void\\": Notable examples There are mash-ups that \\"disrupt the flow of popular music\\", in the words of writer Schroeder, such as a \\"flutedrop\\" remix of the Miley Cyrus song \\"Wrecking Ball\\" and Shaliek's mashup of music by Bruno Mars and Korn. In November 2013, Wang released a set of mp3 files on SoundCloud named Best Drops Ever, which included tracks like \\"A Drop So Epic a Bunch of NYU Bros Already Bought a 3-Day Weekend Pass for It\\" and \\"A Drop So Crazy You'll Kill Your Family\\".Schroeder, Audra (January 10, 2014). \\"From Macklecore to Biggiewave, the surreal world of Weird SoundCloud\\".

The collection is a parody of the over-importance and over-focus of the drop and lack of care of the overall quality of a song common in the modern electronic dance music scene. Wang has released more than 45 tracks in the weird SoundCloud, some of them receiving around a million plays. Subgenres of Weird SoundCloud include Macklecore, mash-ups and remixes that include the works of American hip-hop recording artist Macklemore, and Biggiewave, which include samples of songs from the album Ready to Die (1994) by The Notorious B.I.G. Common audio and meme sources used include Skrillex, the Martin Garrix track \\"Animals\\", Thomas The Tank Engine, Shrek, Macklemore, \\"Gangnam Style\\", the Bruno Mars track \\"Uptown Funk\\", the Disturbed track \\"Down with the Sickness\\", Space Jam, the Childish Gambino track \\"Bonfire\\", the Death Grips track \\"Takyon\\" and air horn sound effects. Reception Bassil praised the SoundClown scene as \\"loveable and strangely honest\\", reasoning that it \\"just reminds me that we're all humans on the internet, all searching for #content that means something, something to connect with, but usually only dredging up bastardised versions of things we've already read, seen, or watched before.\\" Bassil also described the weird SoundCloud as a more successful version of a similar scene known as weird YouTube; the reason for the success of SoundClowns is due to SoundCloud's discovery algorithm: \\"Small collectives and trends are able to form, and there's an abundance of tracks from artists who are almost forging careers out of it, as opposed to uploading one viral hit.\\" Publications have made lists of weird SoundCloud works, such as Buzzfeeds \\"23 Of The Weirdest Songs On Soundcloud\\",\\"23 Of The Weirdest Songs On Soundcloud\\".

From 1869-1888 he was a professor at the Petrovsky Agricultural and Forestry Academy. Trautschold was known as a specialist in the paleontology and stratigraphy of Carboniferous, Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits of the European part of Russia. He was brother of painter Wilhelm Trautschold. Life Hermann Gustav Heinrich Ludwig Trautschold was born on September 17, 1817 in Berlin, in the family of the Berlin merchant Adolf Christoph Ludwig Trautschold and Maria Charlotte Wilhelmine Trautschold (n√©e M√ºller). He graduated from primary school in Spandau and a grammar school in Berlin. In 1844, Trautschold made a trip to Spain, during which he studied botanical research, and then moved to the University of Giessen, where he studied chemistry, mineralogy and crystallography in depth; He showed special interest in geology and paleontology. During his studies in Giessen, Trautschold worked for about one and a half years as an assistant in the laboratory of Justus von Liebig. In 1847, after completing his studies, he obtained a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Giessen.  Career  In 1847-1849 Trautschold traveled to Italy, Germany and Russia, where he was engaged in geological research. During his stay in Russia, he settled for a time as a home teacher in the family of the landowner of Kostroma Province, F.N. Luginin, who lived in Moscow at that time, whom he had met in Germany (one of Trautschold's students, Vladimir, later became a major physicist, professor at Moscow University ); In Russia, Hermann Trautschold was known as G√©rman Ad√≥l πfovich. In 1848 Hermann Trautschold returned to Germany, where in 1849-1857 he was dean of private educational institution. In 1863 he was invited to teach German at the Physics and Mathematics and Medical Faculties of Moscow University. In the course of classes with students and work on translation of natural scientific works, Trautschold mastered the Russian language perfectly; But to do his favorite thing - geological research - he still could only in his spare time from the main job. During his work at the Petrovsky Academy, Trautschold devoted much time to researching the deposits of the Carboniferous and Jurassic periods of the Moscow province, and also repeatedly undertook long-term trips with the purpose of geological survey of the Volga, Ural, Donbass, Crimea and Northern Caucasus regions. Pedagogical work of Trautschold was not limited only to conducting classes and lecturing; He arranged geological excursions for students, took care of replenishing the mineralogical collection of the Petrovsky Academy (which he was in charge of). Some of his geological collections went to Strasbourg and Lisbon, but are no longer preserved. In Russia, much of its collection is in the State Vernadsky Museum of Geology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.

It was a transitional style between Mannerist furniture and Queen Anne furniture. Sturdy, emphasizing both straight lines and curves, and featuring elaborate carving and woodturning, the style was one of the first to imitate Asian design elements such as japanning. About the design In 1688, James II of England was deposed by his daughter, Mary, and her husband, William of Orange, in what came to be known as the \\"Glorious Revolution\\". From birth in 1650, William had reigned over five provinces of the Dutch Republic, and Mary had lived in the Netherlands with him after their marriage in 1677. William and Mary brought to their kingdoms a taste for Dutch furniture styles, as well as a number of Dutch furniture-makers. Although movement toward what would come to be called the William and Mary style had begun during the reign of Charles II of England, primarily due to the influence of his Portuguese-born queen, Catherine of Braganza, the style became defined and widely accepted during the reigns of William (d. 1702) and Mary (d. 1694), initially jointly and then after Mary's death, of William alone. The William and Mary style was influenced by recent French furniture traditions, which in turn were influenced by Italian Baroque furniture designs. William and Mary style furniture emphasized unity, so that all elements contributed to an overall shape or look. It also featured high relief carving, strong curves, and elaborate woodturning. Despite these elements, the style was fairly squat, heavy-looking, and obviously sturdy. Straight lines are common. Paint, stains, or different kind of wood were used to create contrasting colors, which was another element of this style. Japanning, a technique of varnishing which was very popular at the time, was also used on this furniture design. For chairs, woven cane seats and heavily-scrolled backs predominated. Toward the end of the style, cane-woven seats and backs had given way to leather, and straight or slightly angled backs had given way to serpentine forms. Other decorative arts such as architecture, ceramics, silver, and textiles could also feature elements of the William and Mary style. The design movement had an extremely positive impact on the craftsmanship and quality of British furniture. The William and Mary style was a transitional style between Mannerist and Queen Anne furniture. The William and Mary style was very popular in Britain from 1700 to 1725, and in America until about 1735. It was largely supplanted in both nations by Queen Anne style furniture. =English variations= Daniel Marot, a French Huguenot, was employed by King William and Queen Mary to design furniture for them, and became deeply influential on English, Scottish, and Welsh furniture during this period. Dutch furniture craftsman Gerrit Jensen was appointed royal Cabinet Maker to the king and queen, and a great many works of his design were sold to wealthy British citizens of the day. In Britain, case furniture in the William and Mary style tended to feature simple flat surfaces but exquisitely carved trim. Provincial furniture-makers in Britain moved away from the woven cane seat, and developed the leather-covered wooden seat as a vernacular design. Split spindles also came into use, first rurally and then in urban areas. The daybed was developed in Britain as part of the William and Mary style. So, too, was the writing desk, which was an adaptation of the bureau-cabinet. =American variations= A William and Mary style chair made in America. American craftsmen working in the William and Mary style favored a tapered scroll foot for their designs. Walnut and, to a lesser extent, maple were the preferred woods, with walnut burl veneers and \\"ebonization\\" (black japanning) common. Over time, American forms of William and Mary furniture became simplified. Although the Baroque influence was still seen in the crests, feet, and scrolls, other elements and the overall look of pieces began to shed this influence in favor of plain but strong curves. American chairmakers began using woven cane in the splats of chairs as well. For armchairs, American designers favored seats and splats covered in leather, attached with brass nails. In parts of America like New York and New Jersey, which had a heavy Dutch cultural influence, the kast became popular. The kast was of Dutch origin, and featured a large drawer in the base unit. Atop the base were shelves concealed behind one or two heavy doors. An elaborate cornice usually ran along the upper edges. Influenced by the William and Mary style, the American kast featured removable feet, simplified the cornice, and eliminated the intricate inlays favored by the Dutch. The \\"Boston chair\\" became one of the best-known examples of a William and Mary style chair made in America. This spoon-back chair with leather-covered seat and splat featured turned front legs and a turned stretcher between them. The side and rear stretcher as well as the rear legs, however, were undecorated straight lines. The corners of the frame around the splat were usually rounded down (although not turned), and the crest was a simplified geometric or curving design. They were usually painted black or red. Made primarily in Boston, Massachusetts, these chairs were manufactured in large numbers and very popular in America. They were also widely exported to Britain. Benches and settees manufactured in America were less influenced by the William and Mary style. Panels, developed in the 1600s, were used for the seat, back, and (where used) arms, with trim and legs reflecting the new style. Leather seats were, however, sometimes added. Another innovation was the highboy. Essentially two chests of drawers, the lower slightly larger than the upper, American highboys often featured Solomonic or trumpet-shaped legs. It was somewhat common for the faces of the drawers to have a walnut burl veneer. The William and Mary style lasted past the mid-1700s in rural America, often incorporating both Mannerist and Queen Anne styles. Slats began to be used in backs, and yoke-shaped crests became common. Modern popularity The William and Mary style has long been overshadowed in both the United Kingdom and United States by the far more popular styles which came after it. Few reproductions of the furniture may be found today. However, numerous examples of William and Mary style furniture can still widely be found in British rural homes.

Bowen Basin is in Central Queensland. Digging overburden at Dawson Mine near Moura, 2008 The Bowen Basin Coalfields contains the largest coal reserves in Australia. This major coal-producing region contains one of the world's largest deposits of bituminous coal. The Basin contains much of the known Permian coal resources in Queensland including virtually all of the known mineable prime coking coal. It was named for the Bowen River, itself named after Queensland's first Governor, Sir George Bowen. The Bowen Basin covers an area of over 60,000 square kilometres in Central Queensland running from Collinsville to Theodore. There was a combined population of 41,973 people in the area in 2001. The ornamental snake is a small reptile native to the Bowen Basin region.  History  The Bowen Basin covers an area about 600 km long and 250 km wide extending from Collinsville in the north to south of Moura in Central Queensland. It contains about 70% of Queensland's coal. These are deposits of the Permian age and are the most important commercial deposits in the State, producing almost 100% of the State's coking coal and 60% of its thermal coal. In 2006-7, the State's top ten collieries for production were located in the Bowen Basin. Commercial exploitation of Bowen Basin coal began at Blair Athol in the 1890s. At the time, the main coal-producing area was the West Moreton coalfields. Some coal was also produced at the Burrum coalfields and on the Darling Downs. These mines supplied mostly thermal (steaming) coal to a domestic market; the Railway Department was a major customer. The success of mines depended on whether the coal was suitable for firing boilers and on their proximity to a railway line. Most early mines in the Bowen Basin struggled to remain commercially viable. Intensive exploration of the Bowen Basin coalfield began only after the crisis in the base metals industry due to falling prices from 1907. Tests on the Bowen River Coal Company's lease in 1912 and 1913 sparked a rush to the field. Five syndicates had registered 17 leases straddling the Bowen outcrops by the end of 1915. However, the election of Queensland's first stable Labor government led in August 1915 to Cabinet refusing the private applications and reserving the 6.4 square kilometre area involved for State operations. Competition for leases subsided into a long wait for railway construction to be completed. Construction of the 789 kilometres of railway took five years and the delay had exhausted most of the speculators long before the line opened in 1922. At the same time, by the end of 1919, a further nineteen leases had been forfeited to the State for non-payment of rent, and the surviving syndicates had amalgamated to form the Bowen Consolidated Coal Mining Company which established the Bowen Consolidated Colliery in Scottville. Mining A reclaimer operating at Kestrel coal mine, 2006 Most of the basin's open cut and underground coal mines are located in the north. The basin had 48 operational coal mines in August 2011. In mid-2011, evidence of a continuing mining boom was provided by state government figures which showed more than 50 mining projects are under consideration in the Bowen Basin. The Goonyella railway line is the main route for exports of coal via Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point. Exports are also sent via the Port of Gladstone. Rio Tinto Coal Australia's Kestrel coal mine, near Emerald was named after a bird found in the area. =Major coal mines= *Byerwen Mine while still under development employed 1,000 workers in August 2011. *Curragh coal mine employed 1,600 workers in August 2011. *Dawson Central Mine employed 1,560 workers in August 2011. *Goonyella Riverside Mine employed 2,360 workers in August 2011. *Hail Creek coal mine employed 1,270 workers in August 2011. *Peak Downs Mine employed 1,760 workers in August 2011. *Saraji coal mine employed 1,615 workers in August 2011.

Robert Logan Jack was a Queensland Government geologist who reported coal deposits in the basin in 1878. The first attempt to mine coal in the basin was in 1892 at Tolmies. However, by 1900 the site was abandoned. The area around Collinsville was first explored for resources in the 1920s. Large scale coal exploration began in the Bowen Basin in the 1960s. In 2006, 60% of Australia's exported coking coal came out of the Bowen Basin. In 2010, nearly all the mines in the basin were affected by record flooding. Many mines were forced to declare force majeure, meaning they could not meet their contractual obligations. Gas fields =Fairview gas field= The Fairview gas field is developed by the Comet Ridge Project, a coal seam gas extraction project in the Bowen Basin. Fairview is PL 91 located in the Comet Ridge Project Area comprising PLs 90, 91, 92, 99,100, 232, 233,234, 235 and 236 and ATPs 526P, 653P, 655P and 745P, some 500-600 kilometres north-west of Brisbane or 100-200 kilometres north of Roma. Total area is approximately 5,000 square kilometres, stretching 175 kilometres to the north from Injune. The project is operated by Santos Limited, which has a net revenue interest of 76.07%, and a working interest of 79.5%. Santos acquired the Comet Ridge coal seam gas project comprising Fairview and 4,000 square kilometres of exploration acreage in 2005 through the acquisition and subsequent merger of Tipperary Corporation's Australian assets into the Santos gas portfolio. The remaining participants, which include origin parties, hold a combined net revenue interest of 22.93%, and a working interest of 20.5%. The discovery well, the Fairview 1, was drilled in August 1994, followed by a number of other wells which subsequently began dewatering to establish the technical and commercial viability of coal seam gas. Gas production started in January 1995, with first sales gas in February 1998. More than 100 wells have been drilled at year end 2005, with some 80 wells in the Fairview area. Of these, 57 are connected and producing to the gathering system with the remainder undergoing dewatering operations and/or awaiting completion and connection. Gas is gathered to two compressor sites (CS1 and CS2) where it is compressed and dehydrated before export as sales to the Fairview lateral of the Queensland Gas Pipeline system. Following the merger into Santos‚Äô operations on 28 October 2005 and the subsequent integration, extra compression has been brought on line and additional wells connected, which has increased sales gas production by 66%. Sales gas production is around 45 TJ/day, limited by the capacity of the export pipeline. Average well productivity is around 0.9 TJ/day, with a number of wells flowing in excess of 5 TJ/day. Development during 2006 includes the construction of a new 130 kilometre pipeline from CS2 to Wallumbilla, expansion of the gas processing facilities, and drilling and connection of additional wells. This will increase sales gas capacity to 70 TJ/day in 2007. In the longer term, additional development and facilities will enable sales gas production to be increased to approximately 200 TJ/day in 2012, with Santos share approximately 140 TJ/day. =Scotia gas field= The Scotia gas field is in the Bowen Basin, onshore Eastern Queensland, approximately 340 kilometres north-west of Brisbane and 145 kilometres north-east of Roma on the Burunga anticline within PL 176. The area of PL 176 is approximately 213 square kilometres. Santos has a 100% working interest in the project. The discovery well, the Scotia 3, was drilled in 1996. It was the first well drilled to test the late Permian coal seam gas play. Coal seam methane gas production started in 2002. Under a 15-year contract the field supplies CS Energy's gas-fired power station. Total investment to date is approximately A$65 million. The Scotia field comprises 25 connected wells gathered into a central processing facility. The processing includes water separation, glycol dehydration and four-stage compression. Sales gas is transported via a 111-kilometre Scotia/Peat lateral pipeline to join the Roma-Brisbane Pipeline, about 116 kilometres east of Wallumbilla. Environmental concerns Protests against processing and export via an enlarged Gladstone port at Curtis Island, escalated in 2012 and UNESCO have called for greater environmental assessment of the port proposal for the World Heritage Listed Great Barrier Reef. There are also concerns over the pollution of water from the Great Artesian Basin.
