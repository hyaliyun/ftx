Kyunglung Ng√ºka (, ) \\"Silver Palace of Garuda Valley\\", located southwest of Mount Kailash (), identified with palaces found in the upper Sutlej Valley, was the capital city of the ancient kingdom of Zhangzhung. Many Tibetologists and theorists suggest that Kyunglung was perhaps what the Zhangzhung people called Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring.Allen, Charles. (1999). The Search for Shangri-La: A Journey into Tibetan History. Abacus Edition, London. (2000), pp. 266-267; 273-274. . but some very ancient bonpo scripture refer to today's Tajikistan, As from shangshung word Tag-Zig is refer to today's Ta-jik, as sthan is Arabic Urdu word applied when Islamic invasion converted them to Muslims. As time of 7th century Tibetan king Songsten Gampo, today's Tajik was under Tibetan government. Shamgshung Empire was chopped head off when he went to war in Amdo ( today's Chinese given name Qinghai,) Tajik was part of shangshung history as the buddha of Bon tradition believed where he came from. The Zhangzhung ruins Khyunglung is an amazing complex of caves set in the hills on the north bank of the Sutlej River about 30 km west of the hotsprings and gompa of Tirthapuri and the nearby coal mining town of Moinc√™r/Montser in the modern Chinese prefecture of Ali/Ngari in the Tibet Autonomous Region (see Gyurme Dorje, Tibet 3rd ed.). There are further ancient ruins on the hilltops above the Bon monastery of Gurugem/Gurugyam which are only 6 km from Tirthapuri. There is very little published about these sites and virtually no archaeological investigations have been carried out. The caves of Khyunglung are generally small (about 4 square metres) and have a small raised fireplace at the far end. However, almost without exception, they have no chimney and the blackened ceilings make it clear that the smoke exited the cave through the only entrance, making them thick with smoke when the fire was in use. Many of the cave are filled with ancient artifacts dating back to the time of the Zhangzhung. These artifacts include small stones inscribed with ancient Tibetan script, stone statues of Bon deities, and various vases and pots. There is also no obvious recess for a bed or other storage. It seems that these fires were used for sacrificial offerings and some are still in use today as the scattering of bones, feathers etc. make clear. There are no visible springs on site, no water channels or wells and it is therefore probable that water from the river was used. However the caves are downstream of a large sulfurous hotspring and the water in the Sutlej at this point is barely potable (John Snelling, The Sacred Mountain). In addition the immediate vicinity of the caves show no signs of agriculture - there are no terraces for fields and the grazing land is very poor. All in all this seems a very strange site for a permanently occupied city. It has been suggested that Kyunglung was never a city as such, but more of a \\"convention centre for Bonpo magicians\\" and that the caves were used for ceremonial purposes during times when the clans gathered.Buckley, Michael. (2003) Tibet (Bradt Travel Guide). Second edition. (2006), p. 227. . Possible camping grounds for the main retinue would be around the modern village of Khyunglung a few kilometres upstream where the valley is somewhat broader or the area between Gurugem and Tirthapuri which is still heavily used by yak and sheep herding nomads today. The ruins above Gurugem appear to be a more likely site for permanent habitation but much more study would be needed to establish this. The modern village The modern village of Kyunglung lies just upstream from its ancient namesake. It is a tiny community of small households, and the people live and depend heavily on yaks for agriculture and transport. The village itself is very old, and the villagers maintain a way of life that has changed very little in the last hundred years or more. The villagers at Kyunglung follow the ancient religion of Bon, the same religion as their Zhangzhung ancestors.

Benjamin was the youngest of seven children. One of his brothers was Henry Hallett Dale, a future Nobel Prize-winning physiologist and President of the Royal Society (as well as isolating and describing histamine and acetylcholine, he helped uncover important mechanisms of the immune and nervous systems that would transform contemporary understanding of anaphylaxis, allergy, and immunity). Although ten years Benjamin's elder, Henry always remained close to his younger brother and, like their father, both men had a reputation for being affable and approachable, irrespective of position and fame. Despite an indifferent record at school, by the age of 14 Dale was already an accomplished organist and had written a small collection of compositions, including a concert overture called Horatius, inspired by Macaulay. Dale's father arranged for the overture to be played at the Portman Rooms, Baker Street (on 10 May 1900) and was rewarded by a positive review in The Musical Times. Benjamin left school at the age of 15 to enroll as a student of the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). He started at the RAM in September 1900, on the same day as Arnold Bax, another promising pianist- composer, who became a lifelong friend.Foreman, Lewis (1983, rev 2007). Bax: A Composer and his Times, chapter 2. Boydell Press. . There he reunited with an early playground companion, the concert pianist and composer York Bowen, who also remained an especially close friend for the rest of Dale's life. Like the others, Dale studied composition under Frederick Corder, a supporter of Wagner and biographer of Liszt who epitomised the progressive musical climate of the RAM under the direction of Alexander Mackenzie (contrasting with the more conservative Royal College of Music, where composition was Stanford's domain). =Early compositions= While studying at the RAM, Dale worked on several compositions, including the first movement of a piano trio, a complete organ sonata, two concert overtures (one inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest), the Concertst√ºck for organ and orchestra, and his first published work, the Piano Sonata in D minor.Evans, Edwin (1919).

The sonata extended to sixty pages, leading to problems in publication, and the Society of British Composers was founded by a group of composers including Frederick Corder, John Blackwood McEwen and Tobias Matthay at the Royal Academy of Music to address that and similar problems. The society published the sonata in its first publication through its imprint Charles Avison, Ltd. Composed between 1902 and 1905 and dedicated to York Bowen, Dale's piano sonata is a large-scale virtuoso work in just two movements, the second of which combines slow movement, scherzo and finale in a set of variations, a form apparently influenced by Tchaikovsky's Piano Trio.Hardy, Lisa (2001). The British piano sonata, 1870‚Äì1945, pp 42‚Äì48. Boydell Press. . Commentators have discerned various other influences and echoes within this eclectic work, including Liszt's Sonata in B Minor, Schumann's Fantasie in C, Balakirev's Islamey, Glazunov's first piano sonata and Wagner's Liebestod.Stewart, Michael.

Dale's next published work was his three movement Suite for Viola and Piano‚Äîanother sonata in all but name‚Äîdating from 1906, the first of a series of compositions written expressly for the violist and RAM professor Lionel Tertis. This ambitious work stretched the boundaries of viola technique at the time and remains challenging even today: Tertis frequently played it either with Bowen at the piano, or in a later arrangement of the last two movements with orchestral accompaniment (first performed in a 1911 Royal Philharmonic Society concert under Nikisch), which he had encouraged Dale to produce. The Suite was followed by the Phantasy for Viola and Piano (dated 1910) and an Introduction and Andante (1911) for the unusual combination of six independently scored violas, written for performance by Tertis's pupils (one of whom happened to be Eric Coates).

While being kept under parole in Nuremberg as an enemy alien, Dale wrote three song settings (including two part songs), his first new compositions since 1912. In November, Dale was interned in the civilian internment camp at Ruhleben, near Berlin, along with several other prominent musicians, including fellow composer and RAM professor, Frederick Keel, who was in the same barracks. Dale took part in the activities of the Ruhleben Musical Society, formed in 1915 in the wake of a muddy first winter. In particular, he joined forces with the Canadian Ernest MacMillan (later to become the conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra), who gave lectures on each of the nine symphonies of Beethoven: at the end of each lecture, MacMillan and Dale would perform a four hand piano arrangement of the symphony under discussion.Nevins, Maureen (1994).

He coached Real Madrid C.F. from January 1948 to October 1950. His father was the Olympic medal winning cyclist Frederick Keeping. Playing career =Southampton= Keeping was born in Milford on Sea where he was spotted playing for his home-town club, Milford on Sea F.C., and was signed by Southampton, then still in the Southern League, in the summer of 1919 for a bargain fee of ¬£25. Still only 16, Keeping was registered as an amateur but paid 10 shillings (50p) a week for travelling expenses. He signed as a professional in December 1920 but only made his first-team debut on 25 October 1924, in a Football League Division 2 match at Hull City as a replacement for the long-serving Fred Titmuss who was injured. In his first season he made only seven league appearances. In the following season, he again started as an understudy to Titmuss but in October he took over at left- back and retained his position, with Titmuss leaving the club in February 1926. He soon blossomed into an outstanding left-back who \\"oozed class and being fleet of foot could turn on the run to sweep the ball straight up the touchline to the waiting winger\\". He was selected for an international trial in February 1926 and joined an F.A. party on a tour of Canada in the summer. He continued to display his skills in the Second Division and was an ever- present for the Saints in 1926‚Äì27 both in the league and in their run to the F.A. Cup semifinal at Stamford Bridge on 26 March 1927, which Southampton lost 1‚Äì2 to Arsenal. During this season manager Arthur Chadwick soon settled on his favoured line-up with eleven players featuring in at least 35 of the 42 league games; Keeping lined up in defence with Ted Hough behind the three centre- backs ‚Äì Bert Shelley, George Harkus and Stan Woodhouse. He missed the start of the 1927‚Äì28 season due to illness, but was otherwise a regular starter throughout the next four seasons as Saints regularly finished in mid-table. He played for the \\"Professionals\\" in the 1929 FA Charity Shield. He made a good start to the 1931‚Äì32 season and won his only representative honours when he played for the Football League against the Irish League in September 1931. He was then struck down with appendicitis in January and was out for the rest of the season. In February 1933 Southampton needed to raise cash and they sold Keeping and Johnny Arnold to Fulham for a combined fee of ¬£5,000, with Arthur Tilford temporarily joining the Saints. Jimmy McIntyre, the former Saints manager now in charge at Fulham boasted that this was \\"the best deal I ever brought off\\". In his playing career at The Dell, Keeping made a total of 281 appearances for the Saints, scoring twelve goals. In Holley and Chalk's \\"Alphabet of the Saints\\", Keeping is described as \\"a debonair man, contemporaries recall him as being equally stylish off the pitch and, much to the amusement of his team-mates, he would take hours over his appearance\\". In 1938 it was noted that he was the game's only air pilot and flew his own aeroplane. He also owned couple of garages.Louis T. Kelly: Stud Marks, Liverpool Echo, 10 September 1938, p. 6 =Fulham= Keeping joined Fulham in February 1933 and served them well until the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He continued to turn out occasionally for Fulham until 1941 when he returned to Milford to join the family motor business. Management career From February 1948 to October 1950 he was coach at Real Madrid C.F. with which he won the Copa Eva Duarte, precursor of the Spanish Supercup, winning the final as cup winner of 1947 against the champions of 1947 Valencia CF in June 1948. In his first match his team shipped four goals in a 1-4 defeat to Celta de Vigo, a feat only repeated in August 2018 when Julen Lopetegui lost his first match 2-4 to Atl√©tico de Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup final.OptaJoe, 2018-08-16 Best league placings were the third and fourth ranks in 1949 and 1950. He was sacked in October 1950, after the eighth matchday for unsuitable remarks. Preceding there were also some hefty defeats in the league against Real Sociedad, FC Barcelona and Deportivo la Coru√±a with results of 2-6, 2-7 and 0-5. After having had an administrative position with a Dutch side, in January 1959 he became successor of Stan Rickaby at Southern League club Poole Town.Keeping Gets Poole Job, Daily Mail (London), 21 January 1959, p. 9. Between September 1960 and January 1961, when he unexpectedly resigned for family reasons, her returned to England to get married, he was manager of the Dutch second division side Heracles Almelo He is also reported to have held positions in Denmark, France and North Africa.

His name is also spelled in many \\"Breton\\" variants: Fran√ßois Debauvais, Fransez Debeauvais, Fransez Debauvais, Fa√±ch Debeauvais, Fa√±ch Debauvais, Fa√±ch deb. Breiz Atao Debeauvais was the son of a gardener from Le Pertre. Initially he worked as a pharmacist, but soon became an activist for Breton nationalism. He was associated with the founding of Breiz Atao (Brittany Forever), the Breton nationalist journal. He was named president of Unvaniez Yaounkiz Breiz, the Breton nationalist youth wing, in 1920. He quickly rose within the movement, becoming associated with the faction of Yann Bricler, and Olier Mordrel. He took part in Breiz Atao's Pan- Celtic Congress in Quimper in 1924, with Yann Sohier, Youenn Drezen, Jakez Riou, Abeozen and Marcel Guieysse. According to the memoirs of his wife Anna Youenou (a fellow member of Breiz Atao, whom he married in 1929) he was much influenced by Charles Maurras at this time. In 1930, he proposed the creation of a major weekly magazine to be called Le Peuple Breton (the Breton People), but was unable to secure sufficient funding. Breton National Party With the split in Breton nationalism between federalists and independentists, Fran√ßois Debeauvais supported the latter and joined the newly formed Breton National Party. He continued as editor of Breiz Atao. He was also connected to the Gwenn-ha-du, the terrorist wing of the movement. In March 1933, Breiz Atao published a programme named \\"SAGA\\" (Strollad Ar Gelted Adsavet: Programme of Revived Celts), which was worked out by Mordrel. Debeauvais was careful to present it as a proposal for the direction of the party, not as its policy. The fascistic and racist nature of Modrel's programme provoked criticism from many readers. In 1937, Debeauvais prevented Mordrel's extremist faction from seizing the power within the PNB. Nevertheless, Debeauvais's views had much in common with Mordrel. During the late 1930s, both men forged links with the Nazi party. As World War II approached, the French government sought to prosecute him for seditious activities. After a period in exile in Belgium, Debeauvais was imprisoned for 6 months. On 14 December 1938 he and Mordrel were condemned to a further term for \\"attacking the unity of the nation\\". He was released on 25 July 1939, after apologising on 15 February 1939. Exile in Nazi Germany cabinet with swastika motifs designed by Ren√©-Yves Creston as a wedding present for Debauvais and Anna YouenouWith the declaration of the war between France and Germany, the Breton National Party was dissolved by the French government of √âdouard Daladier. The party's property was confiscated and files destroyed; Debeauvais and Mordrel chose to go into exile rather than support France. From Amsterdam, Mordrel and Debeauvais addressed a proclamation to Bretons, condemning the war. By the end of 1939 he had moved to Berlin \\"to try to play the card of Breton independence in the probable outcome of French defeat\\". In Germany, the Pangermanist faction recommended the extension of the Reich to all the German-speaking populations and the dismantling of the great European powers according to linguistic criteria, a view consistent with Breton nationalism. The creation of a Breton State also found supporters among militarists who wished to break up France so that it would no longer rival Germany. In January 1940, Debeauvais and Mordrel drafted a \\"War Letter\\" (Lizer Brezl) to their militant supporters, insisting that \\"a true Breton does not have the right to die for France\\". They added, \\"Our eternal enemies and our present ones are the French, it is they who have never ceased to wrong Brittany\\". In April 1940, in imitation of Roger Casement, he devised a project of unloading arms from a submarine on the coast of the Leon, to allow him to reconstitute the Breton National Party as a secret paramilitary group. He abandoned the plan after Mordrel intervened. On 7 May 1940, he and Mordrel were tried in absentia by a military tribunal at Rennes for \\"attacking the external safety of the State and the integrity of the territory, maintenance or recruitment of a dissolved group, provocation of soldiers to desertion and treason\\". They were degraded militarily and condemned to death. At the beginning of May 1940, Debeauvais declared in Berlin a Breton \\"government in exile\\" (Bretonische Regierung). It was not however officially recognised by the Nazis. Nevertheless, the Nazis gave Debeauvais and Mordrel \\"stateless persons\\" passports, and sympathisers within the German secret service allowed them to travel freely. Debeauvais returned from exile to France along with the victorious German army in June 1940, arriving in Brittany on 1 July. Later in the month, at the \\"Congress of Pontivy\\", Debeauvais and Mordrel created the Breton National Committee. They also founded a new journal, L'Heure Bretonne to replace Breiz Atao. 201 issues appeared between July 1940 and June 1944. Its first editor was Morvan Lebesque. Illness and death In October 1940, Debeauvais's health suddenly worsened. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and his doctors prescribed rest. He moved away from political activism, but did take part in the ousting of Mordrel from the Breton National Committee at the end of 1940 and the appointment of Raymond Delaporte to replace him. His goal moved to establishing a National Socialist form of Breton nationalism devoted to communitarian policies of \\"anti-capitalism and anti-Judeo-Communism\\". He became secretary of the commission of the Celtic Institute of Brittany between 1941 and 1943. In January 1944, suffering from severe tuberculosis, he entered a private clinic in Colmar. A last attempt to take back control of the party led to his support for the paramilitary groups set up by C√©lestin Lain√©. He greeted the newly formed Perrot formation of Lain√©'s movement: > Comrades of the Perrot formation, I greet you.... It is not because we > believe that Germany will emerge victorious from this gigantic conflict > that, from the first day of the war, we were at its side. Our choice was not > about opportunism, but a common vision of the world on essential points.... > The situation has already been clarified, by returning to the policy of > Breiz Atao which was very clear. This policy consisted, from the external > point of view, to seek German support. We worked there with others, for > nearly twenty years. Shortly before his death he made his son join the Hitler Youth at Zillisheim. He died on 20 March 1944 in Colmar. After the war, his widow Anna Youenou associated with the Breton nationalist clique in Paris. In 1968 she wrote an account of her husband's life.

The base is located approximately north of Reims; about northeast of Paris. Squadrons and aircraft * 2 reconnaissance squadrons equipped with Dassault Mirage F1CR. : 01/33 Belfort : 02/33 Savoie History Reims Air Base was authorized by the French Air Ministry in 1925 and was opened in October 1928. Much work was needed to restore the land in the area after the ravages of the World War I Western Front, and the myriad of trenches built, all needed to be filled in, the land leveled, unexploded ordnance removed and have a graded, smooth grass surface for airplane operations as well as a support facility. Reims was planned to be the \\"showcase\\" base of the Arm√©e de l'Air. It had a concrete parking apron; hangars and a support area, and consisted of a grass field for aircraft takeoffs and landings. The first unit to arrive at Reims was the Breguet 19‚Äìequipped 12th Regiment, which arrived from the Occupied Rhineland airdrome at Lachen-Speyerdorf.History of Reims BA 112 During the 1930s, the base was greatly expanded and modernized. Known units assigned to BA 112 during the decade were: * 4th Fighter Wing (1933) * 5th Fighter Wing (1936‚Äì1937) * 601st Infantry Group of the Air (1937) ‚Äì the only parachute unit of the Air Force. * II/13 Group (1939) ‚Äì Night Fighter Unit With the breakout of World War II in 1939, Reims was reinforced with additional units. In May 1940, the following units were stationed at Reims BA 112:Arm√©e de l'Air Order of Battle, 10 May 1940 * I/15 Group, equipped with 11 Farman F.222 * II/15 Group, equipped with 9 Farman F.222 In addition, RAF units of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force were attached to Reims equipped with Fairey Battles The base was seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France. In 1941 the Luftwaffe designated the base a \\"Flugplatz A213/XI\\" and it became a maintenance and repair depot for Junkers aircraft, in particular Junkers Ju 88s. It was attacked by Eighth Air Force bombers beginning in the second half of 1943, with a particular damaging raid in April 1944. It was also the target of numerous night leaflet drops aimed at resistance forces in the area.USAFHRA Document 00222448 It was liberated by Allied ground forces 30 August 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the United States Army Air Forces IX Engineer Command 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft. Fortunately, little battle damage was sustained, and Reims-Champaigne airfield became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as \\"A-62\\" the same day of its liberation.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout The combat engineers laid down a 5000' Pierced Steel Planking all weather runway, aligned northeast-southwest (05/23), along with an almost parallel 5000' turf runway (06/24). Under American control, Ninth Air Force assigned the 440th Troop Carrier Group to the base, flying C-47 Skytrain transports until the end of September. On 19 September, the 373d Fighter Group moved in with P-47 Thunderbolts which flew combat missions in eastern France until the end of October when it moved up closer to the front lines. Afterward, Reims became a resupply and casualty evacuation airfield, as well as liaison aircraft assigned to Allied headquarters in the city. The Americans returned full control of the airport to French authorities July 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . After the war, Reims Air Base became a massive aircraft storage depot for surplus (mostly American) aircraft. From Reims, aircraft were sold under the Military Assistance Program to France and other Western European countries; to private individuals, and some to scrapyards for metal reclamation. From 1945 BA112 insignia . Eisenhower on BA112 in 1951 . The base was reactivated in 1949 as an active French Air Force base. The infrastructure of the base, which was badly damaged by the Allied bombing raids of the Junkers works during the war was torn down and replaced with new, modern buildings. The American perforated steel planking (PSP) runway and grass landing strips were removed, although the outline of the wartime runway can be seen in aerial photography, somewhat blurred for security . A jet-capable 8000' jet runway and taxiways were laid down to the southwest along with additional aircraft ramp space, dispersals with hardened Tab-Vs, hangars and a support area. Initially de Havilland Vampires were assigned to the base in 1950; later Republic F-84 Thunderjets, and in 1959, North American F-100 Super Sabres. French Air Force units deployed from Reims to Egypt during the 1956 Suez Crisis, and also to Cyprus. In June 1966, Escadron de Chasse 2/30 Normandie-Niemen arrived, which would stay for decades. In 1973, the Mirage F1 was assigned. EC 2/30 was redesignated and then left in 1993. In 2008 it was announced that the base would be closed. The last aircraft departed in July 2011 and the air base definitively closed in June 2012. In 2014, the air-base hosted the annual May teknival, but it is otherwise derelict.

He also desired to promote Islamic unity and concern to help end the oppression and subjugation of Muslims in the world. He organised a worldwide signature campaign on the question of Jammu and Kashmir and, in 1950 presented to the UN secretary general, a mile long scroll signed by one million people in support of the people of Kashmir. He also played a major role in helping to settle the war between Iran and Iraq.  Awards  Inamullah Khan received several awards for his work. He was awarded the Japanese award in 1987, Niwano Peace Prize and the Templeton Prize for progress in Religion in 1988. Allegations of antisemitism The Anti-Defamation League opposed awarding of Templeton Prize to Khan claiming that Khan had supported antisemitism, and that the World Muslim Congress' newsletter had supported antisemitic propaganda such as the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion and The International Jew. Khan denied being anti-semitic. The ADL also noted Khan's longstanding links to the anti- communist World League for Freedom and Democracy. Khan said he participated in their conferences because \\"as a religious person, I am opposed to all atheistic creeds.\\"New York Times, 19 April 1988, Anti-Semitism Charges Lead To Delay on Religion Prize Southern Poverty Law Center says that Khan supports Holocaust denial.

It was established as a legal entity of public law according to the December 11, 2009 law of Georgia, succeeding the Department of Statistics of the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia. The head office is located in Tbilisi.About GeoStat. GeoStat. Accessed December 29, 2011. History The earliest references to the collection of statistics in Georgia date from the 13th century. Materials from population censuses made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in various regions of the country have survived to the present day.History. GeoStat. Accessed December 29, 2011. On November 15, 1918 a temporary Statistical Bureau was formed within the Ministry of Agriculture of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. The bureau's functions included development of materials for agricultural census, accounting of the available land and determining of norms for its distribution. On the basis of law enacted by the Constituent Assembly on July 25, 1919, a Republican Statistical Committee was formed within the same ministry. The committee was assigned to manage all types of statistical works of national importance. During the Soviet rule (1921‚Äì1991), the national statistics service was provided by the Central Statistics Division. In a newly independent Georgia, it was succeeded by the Social and Economic Information Committee established at the Parliament of Georgia (1991‚Äì1995), the State Department of Social and Economic Information (1995‚Äì1997), and the State Department of Statistics of Georgia (1997‚Äì2004). The department was subordinated to the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development in 2004 and made an independent agency under the current name in 2010. Mission GeoStat is an official authority exclusively responsible for production and dissemination of official statistics in accordance with international statistical standards and requirements. Its principal purposes are collection, editing, processing, storage, analysis and dissemination of exhaustive, up to date, reliable and com¬¨pa¬¨rable statistical data. One of the main functions of GeoStat is provision of official statistics to the civil society, official authorities, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), the mass media, business and academic communities and other categories of users. Its information is open and accessible to all users. GeoStat regularly publishes the country's social and economic indicators on its website. Structure The agency is led by the executive director, who is appointed by the Prime Minister of Georgia for the term of 4 years. The Executive Director also acts as the Chairman of the GeoStat Board which consists of 8 members. The agency consists of the central office and eleven regional branches. The present structure of the GeoStat was put in place following a reorganisation in 2018. It consists of 10 Departments: Strategic Planning, Coordination and Communication Department, Information Technology Department, Internal Audit Department, National Accounts Department, Social Statistics Department, Population Census and Demography Department, Price Statistics Department, Business Statistics Department, External Trade and Foreign Investments Statistics Department, Agriculture and Environment Statistics Department. Apart from subject divisions there are 11 regional bureaus which are also structural units of GeoStat. International cooperation GeoStat actively cooperates with international organizations such as the UN, its regional and specialized agencies, Eurostat, other international organizations, and statistical institutions of various countries. Since Georgia joined the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 2010, GeoStat acquired a coordinating role of its implementation through other government institutions such as the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of Georgia. Over 2011-2018 GeoStat has been involved in a major bilateral cooperation project with Statistics Sweden covering such areas as National accounts, Price statistics, Statistical methods, etc. References External links *GeoStat official website Government of Georgia (country) Georgia ","title":"National Statistics Office of Georgia"},{"id":"13290306","text":"The water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is a domesticated bovid widely kept in Asia, Europe and South America.

Biography Abo was born in Saga Prefecture as Sawano Yasusabur≈ç, where his father was the commandant of the military academy where he went to school. His father died when he was still young, but the deputy commandant, Abo Kiyoyasu, took notice of young Abo and adopted him into his household on the condition that he marry his daughter. As Kiyokazu Abo, he graduated from the 18th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, ranked 11th out of 61 cadets. He served his midshipman tour on the corvettes Hiei, Jingei, cruisers and Takao.

During the Russo- Japanese War, he became famous for coining nicknames for each of the ships in the Russian fleet, to make identification and transmission of orders to the Japanese gunnery crews more understandable. After the war, he was assigned as naval attach√© to the United Kingdom from November 1905 to February 1908. During his time overseas, he was promoted to commander. On his return, he instructed at the Naval Staff College, and in 1909 succeeded to the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system on the death of his foster father. In 1910, Abo received his first command: the cruiser . Promoted to captain in December 1912, he was again sent to England as naval attach√© from March 1913 to April 1915. On his return, he assumed command of the battleship . In December 1916, Abo was promoted to rear admiral and became chief of the first section of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. In December 1920, he was promoted to vice admiral and became Vice Chief of the Imperial Navy General Staff, where he assisted Admiral Yamashita Gentar≈ç in the implementation of the Washington Naval Treaty. Abo was Japan's naval delegate to the League of Nations from 1922‚Äì1923, He served as Director of Naval Shipbuilding Command in 1923, and as Vice Minister of the Navy in 1924.

From 3 October 1930 to 13 December 1931, Abo served as Naval Minister in the cabinets of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç and Hamaguchi Osachi. Abo was a political moderate and a leading supporter of the Treaty Faction within the Imperial Japanese Navy, and hoped for a revival of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance through diplomacy. During his term in office, the military was embroiled with the chain of command controversy as to whether or not the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy were answerable to the elected Diet of Japan and Prime Minister, or were answerable only directly to the Emperor of Japan. Abo went into the reserves in 1934, and retired in 1940.

Coleman (4 January 1908 ‚Äì 20 January 1984) was an English footballer. Career Born in Blidworth, Nottinghamshire, Coleman started his career as a youth playing for Hucknall. After being turned down by Nottingham Forest he joined Halifax Town of the Third Division North in 1927. He scored five times in nineteen appearances, enough to catch the attention of Grimsby Town of the Second Division, joining them in March 1928. In just eight appearances in the 1928-29 season he scored seven times, helping Grimsby reach the First Division. Coleman remained at Grimsby for the next three seasons, and was Grimsby's top scorer in 1930-31 and 1931-32, and in March 1932 was signed by Herbert Chapman for ¬£7,500 to join the reigning league champions, Arsenal; he made 85 league appearances for Grimsby, scoring 57 goals. Intended as a replacement for Jack Lambert, Coleman made his Arsenal debut in a 2‚Äì1 win against Leicester City at Highbury on 5 March 1932 and played a total of six games that season, as Arsenal finished runners-up to Everton. In his first full season at the club, 1932-33, Coleman scored 24 times in just 27 league games, including two hat-tricks as Arsenal reclaimed their title, earning Coleman a championship medal. However, his form dropped in 1933-34 and he only scored once in 12 league appearances. The signing of Ted Drake in March 1934 meant Coleman was forced out of the Arsenal team, and he signed for Middlesbrough in August 1934. In total he had played 47 games for Arsenal, scoring 26 goals. Coleman spent three seasons with Middlesbrough, scoring 21 goals in 85 league appearances, before finishing his career with Norwich City. After the Second World War, he was manager of Linby Colliery he left Linby to manage Notts County and saved them from relegation from the Football League. He died in 1984, aged 76.

Originally known as Oranje Building (sometimes spelled Oranjie), it formerly housed a shopping mall. The building had since redeveloped along with adjoined Capitol Building and both were reopened as a hotel The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore in October 2018. History The building was designed by Regent Alfred John Bidwell (1869‚Äì1918) of Swan & Maclaren in 1904 for the Armenian firm of Stephens, Paul & Company. The bottom two floors were leased to retail firm Whiteaway Laidlaw & Co. =1900-1960: The Hotel= Because of a shortage of hotel rooms, Raffles Hotel took over the top two floors of the Building in 1911 as an annexe for two years, calling this Raffles Lodge. The Oranje Building was renovated in 1920 by Arathoon Sarkies in the will to transform the building into a high-end hotel. In 1921, the Grosvenor was opened in the Oranje Building on 1 August 1921 with 50 rooms and the same menu as Raffles. An early advertisement specified ‚Äúspecial rate for Families, Planters, and Miners and Members of the Civil Service‚Äù. The Grosvenor was closed in August 1926 and its furniture was auctioned off. The rooms were renovated and renamed Stamford Hotel and Restaurant in September 1926. It was then reinstated the name: the Grosvenor and managed by Hoseb Arathoon. In 1933-1934, Seth Paul's daughter Klara Van Hien took the hotel out of Hoseb's hands and renamed it Oranje Hotel. In December 1941, a number of survivors of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse were first housed in the Oranje Hotel. During the Japanese Occupation, the building continued to be used by the Japanese forces as a hotel. After World War II, the hotel rooms were rented out and ground floor of the building used as shops. =1960-1980: The Stamford House= In 1963, the building changed hands and was sold to Basco Enterprises Private Limited. It refurbished the building and renamed the building as Stamford House. Together with the adjacent Shaws Building, which housed the Capitol Theatre, the Stamford House was once a main shopping centre in Singapore. The upper two layer of the building was a modern and comfortable air-conditioned office- block, occupied by internationally known organisations. Basco Enterprises‚Äô Bobby-O Department Store, which mainly sold electronic equipment and jewellery, was opened in the building likely in the 1970s and remained there until the 1980s. =1980-2000: Conservation= Stamford Court, facing Stamford House, is sited on a portion of the site of the demolished Eu Court building. In 1984, the Stamford House, together with the Shaws Building, was acquired by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which imposed planning restrictions to preserve the building. In May 1991, a decision was made to forgo preserving the similarly rustic four-storey Eu Court and conserve Stamford House instead as the latter had more potential for commercial purposes. Later the same year, Stamford House underwent extensive conservation and restoration works. Despite protests by the public, Eu Court was demolished in 1992 for road widening with the aim of easing future traffic congestion on Hill Street. Today, a new building, Stamford Court, is sited on a portion of the site of the former Eu Court building. The S$13 million conservation project for Stamford House was undertaken by the main contractor Batae Engineering, and took three years. The Stamford House was re-opened as a furniture and furnishings centre on 28 March 1995. The shopping mall has a rentable space of 3,350 square metres (36,000 square feet) over three floors, and was managed by Pidemco Land (now CapitaLand). =2000-Presence: Redevelopment= In 2008, Stamford House, along with its stretch of adjoining buildings including Capitol Building, Capitol Theatre and Capitol Centre, were offered to potential developers as a single integrated site for commercial redevelopment. In 2010, a consortium formed by Pua Seck Guan‚Äôs Perennial Real Estate and Chesham Properties won a bid to restore Stamford House, Capitol Theatre and Capitol Building into a hotel, shops, residences, and a theatre. Grant Associates worked closely with the project's lead architect, Richard Meir and Partners Architects, the project consist of Singapore's largest cinema cum theatre complex, a 6 stars luxury hotel and a shopping mall, with a total size of 21,000 m. In November 2011, Shimizu Corporation was awarded the redevelopment project to develop into a large scale mixed use complex called \\"Capitol Development\\". There was a shopping component named Capitol Piazza and also a residential component, named Eden Residences Capitol, which were on the site or the demolished Capitol Centre. The redevelopment of the complex was completed and its topping out ceremony held in 3 April 2014. In 2015, Stamford House and its adjoined Capitol Building were refurbished and scheduled to be reopened as a six-star hotel The Patina, Capitol Singapore by the end of 2015, however was delayed due to dispute among its owners. By 2016, the project stalled when disagreement arose within the consortium, and the hotel spread across Capitol Building and Stamford House failed to open although a Temporary Occupation Permit was given in October 2017. The deadlock was broken by a settlement made in the High Court in January 2018 and, in March, Perennial bought out Chesham Properties for about $528 million. Later in May 2018, the Perennial Real Estate Holdings appointed Kempinski Hotels S.A. to took over as its operator. The Stamford House and Capitol Building were officially opened as The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore on 1 October 2018. Architecture The Stamford House was designed by RAJ Bidwell, who was also the architect for Raffles Hotel, Goodwood Park Hotel and other significant buildings in Singapore. The building is architecturally well-related to its environs, including the adjacent Capitol Theatre and the MPH Building on Stamford Road. The Stamford House is a variation of the Venetian Renaissance architectural style that was popular in commercial buildings in the Victorian period. It has an appealing, romantic architectural composition with its curved central pediment and two triangular ones at either end. With its Adamesque-like mouldings and elaborate ornamental devices, the three-storey Stamford House is typical of the High Victorian phase. The building has an arcade which allows natural light to enter. It mainly housed offices, with shops on the ground floor opening on to a five-foot way. A hallmark of many older buildings in the colonial district, the covered walkway around the Stamford provides shade and encourages pedestrian traffic by shoppers and tourists. =Restoration= The Stamford House's characteristic gold tinted detailing was only revealed during restoration work between 1991 and 1994. A frieze of intricate floral plaster on the fa√ßade was found beneath another layer of plain plaster, for which no historical records were found. Solid granite columns were uncovered from under layers of plaster at the main entrance. The solid pillars were carved from a single huge slab of granite. Exquisitely wrought cast-iron grilles, in the same intricate floral design as the frieze, were revealed after years of being covered by bland shop signs. The missing pieces were restored by a Malaysian craftsman. Though the walls of Stamford House were in a good condition, 50% of the plasterwork and cornices were damaged. Most of the wooden floor boards in the building were rotten and had to be replaced with chengai (Balanscarpus heimii), a tropical hardwood. New doors in the original style had to be made. All originals were photographed meticulously before work began. Modern services had to be added sensitively, so that wiring and the air conditioning vents do not jar with the original architecture. New additions were introduced to maintain the old-world ambience of the building. These include brass lamps from Italy, ground flooring done in the original marble, a hydraulic lift with brass doors and chengai timber covering for the new concrete floors. Decorative features were also added internally to reflect the rich facade: naked steel I-beams were clad in plaster, and the old outhouse, a wing which contained only toilets, was turned into an attached wing for shops and services. A modern skylight allows sunlight to illuminate the building's interior. The corner store was turned into an external foyer where people can walk in from both sides of the road. As there were no records of the building's interior decor, the contractors had to uncover clues and make decisions on colour, pattern and size, sometimes based on straw polls taken from passers-by. The main contractor Batae Engineering employed the preferred top-down approach, from the roof down to the floor, for Stamford House's restoration. Controversy In 1991, there is a debate over whether to demolish EU Court or Stamford House for a road widening project. EU Court is an endangered art deco styled building across Hill Street from Stamford House which was built in the late 1920s as an apartment block. However during the period of time, there is a fundamental issue of traffic congestion in that area which leads to the consideration of road widening. This sparks controversy as experts think that policy-makers should focus on stopping the car growth problem instead of simply expanding the road. However in the end, EU Court was still being demolished in 1992 to make way for the widening of Victoria and Hill Streets, being replaced by Stamford Court, a building that seems rather out of sync with the architecture of the area. Therefore, decision was made to forgo preserving EU Court and conserve Stamford House instead. This is mainly because Stamford House was claimed to have ‚Äúgreater potential to become an active and successful commercial centre‚Äù.\\"Stamford House\\" National Library Board Retrieved 7 March 2019 http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_925_2005-01-27.html Notes References  * External links * Uniquely Singapore: Shopping in North Bridge Road Shopping malls in Singapore Landmarks in Singapore Downtown Core (Singapore) Commercial buildings completed in 1904 ","title":"Stamford House, Singapore"},{"id":"13290370","text":"Joseph Arthur Calixte √âthier, (May 26, 1868 - August 14, 1936) was a Canadian politician.

Lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA) or expanded clay (exclay) is a lightweight aggregate made by heating clay to around in a rotary kiln. The yielding gases expand the clay by thousands of small bubbles forming during heating producing a honeycomb structure. LECA has an approximately round or potato shape due to circular movement in the kiln and is available in different sizes and densities. LECA is used to make lightweight concrete products and other uses. History LECA was developed about 1917 in Kansas City, Missouri, to the production in a rotary kiln of a patented expanded aggregate known as Haydite which was used in the construction of USS Selma, an ocean-going ship launched in 1919. Following in the USA was the development of a series of aggregates known as Gravelite, Perlite, Rocklite, etc. In Europe, LECA commenced in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, and UK. Characteristics LECA is usually produced in different sizes and densities from up to , commonly 0‚Äì4 mm, 4‚Äì10 mm, 10‚Äì25 mm and densities of 250, 280, 330, and 510 kg/m3. LECA boulder is the biggest size of LECA with 100‚Äì500 mm size and 500 kg/m3 density. Some characteristics of LECA are lightness, thermal insulation by low thermal conductivity coefficient (as low as 0.097 W/mK), soundproofing by high acoustic insulation, moisture impermeability, being incompressible under permanent pressure and gravity loads, not decomposing in severe conditions, fire resistance, a pH of nearly 7, freezing and melting resistance, easy movement and transportation, lightweight backfill and finishing, reduction of construction dead load and earthquake lateral load, being perfect sweet soil for plants, and as a material for drainage and filtration.  Uses  Common uses are in concrete blocks, concrete slabs, geotechnical fillings, lightweight concrete, water treatment, hydroponics, aquaponics and hydroculture. substrate. LECA is a versatile material and is utilized in an increasing number of applications. In the construction industry, it is used extensively in the production of lightweight concrete, blocks and precast or incast structural elements (panels, partitions, bricks and light tiles). LECA used in structural backfill against foundations, retaining walls, bridge abutments etc., in addition, it can reduce earth pressure by 75% compared with conventional materials, and also increases ground stability while reducing settlement and land deformation. LECA can drain the surface water and groundwater to control groundwater pressure. LECA grout can be used for flooring (finishing) and roofing with thermal and sound insulation. LECA is also used in water treatment facilities for the filtration and purification of municipal wastewater and drinking water as well as in other filtering processes, including those for dealing with industrial wastewater and fish farms. LECA has uses in agriculture and landscapes. It can alter soil mechanics. It is used as a growing medium in hydroponics systems since blended with other growing mediums such as soil and peat, it can improve drainage, retain water during periods of drought, insulate roots during frost, and provide roots with increased oxygen levels promoting very vigorous growth. LECA can be mixed with heavy soil to improve its aeration and drainage.

Extending down the slopes from the palace, this walled park was reserved only for palace dwellers during the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II. The area of Yƒ±ldƒ±z used to be a forest in Byzantine times. Starting during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultans made it their hunting grounds. In the next centuries, it remained as a grove behind the seaside palaces. The neighbourhood began to flourish in the wake of construction of the palace in the 19th century. It took its name from the first pavilion, namely Yƒ±ldƒ±z Kasrƒ±, commissioned by Selim III in early 19th century. The of the palace's external garden were surrounded by high walls and detached from a grove during the reign of Abdulhamid II in the 19th century.

Life  Edward Stone was born in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, England, in 1702. His parents were Edward Stone, a gentleman farmer, and his first wife Elizabeth Reynolds. His mother having died, his father took a second wife, Elizabeth Grubb, in 1707; the Grubb family was to play a major role in Stone's life. Stone went to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1720, where in 1730 he became a Fellow.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Stone, Edward (1) In 1728 or 1729 he was ordained deacon and priest, and served as curate at Charlton-on- Otmoor. From 1738 Stone held a living at Horsenden, Buckinghamshire, to which he was presented by John Grubb, brother to his stepmother. He married Elizabeth Grubb(e) at Mercers' Hall Chapel, Cheapside (a non-parochial church), London, on 7 July 1741: she was John Grubb's daughter. As was required at that period, Stone resigned as Fellow of Wadham on marrying. In 1745, Stone became chaplain to Sir Jonathan Cope, 1st Baronet at Bruern Abbey and served various curacies around Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. Cope had presented him to the living of Drayton, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, which he held from 1742. He entered politics at the general election of 1754, as a Whig agent, liked but being found \\"slow\\" by Lady Susan Keck. He was rewarded in 1755 with a post, a Justice of the Peace (JP) for Oxfordshire, where he was active in administering the Poor Law. Stone at one time lived on the site of the Hitchman Brewery in West Street, Chipping Norton, where a blue plaque has now been erected.Blue plaque to Stone on Hitchman Brewery, Chipping Norton He was buried in Horsenden in 1768. Works = Aspirin = Walking one day through a meadow near Chipping Norton, while suffering from \\"agues\\", Stone was prompted to detach and nibble at a small piece of bark from a willow tree and was struck by its extremely bitter taste. Knowing that the bark of the Peruvian cinchona tree ‚àí from which quinine (used in the treatment of malarial fevers) is derived ‚àí has a similarly bitter taste, he surmised that the willow might also have therapeutic properties. Stone's interest in willows was due to the ancient \\"doctrine of signatures\\" ‚Äì whereby the cause of a disease offers a clue to its treatment. According to Stone: > \\"As this tree delights in a moist or wet soil, where agues chiefly abound, > the general maxim that many natural maladies carry their cures along with > them or that their remedies lie not far from their causes was so very > apposite to this particular case that I could not help applying it [...].\\" He experimented by drying a pound of willow bark and creating a powder which he gave to about fifty persons: it was consistently found to be \\"a powerful astringent and very efficacious in curing agues and intermitting disorders\\".‚Äô He had discovered salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin. On 25 April 1763, he sent a letter announcing his discovery to George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, President of the Royal Society. The letter survives to this day. On publication, the letter was attributed to \\"Edmund\\" Stone, a clerical error that has caused continuing confusion. A less corrosive compound of salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, produced by reacting sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride, was developed from 1897 by Felix Hoffmann and Arthur Eichengr√ºn. It was marketed by Bayer under the name Aspirin which was registered as a trade name on 23 January 1899. =Religious= In 1732, after giving a university sermon, Stone engaged in a pamphlet controversy with Thomas Chubb. Over 30 years later he published Remarks Upon The History of the Life of Reginald Pole, a book commenting on a work of Thomas Phillips who had published a biography of Cardinal Pole. In 1771, after his death, his son Edward began publishing versions of some of Stone's sermons, as Discourses upon some Important Subjects. =Astronomy= Stone was interested by the Transit of Venus, 1761. In 1763, he published The whole doctrine of parallaxes explained and illustrated by an arithmetical and geometrical construction of the transit of Venus over the sun, 6 June 1761. It covered material related to the upcoming Transit of Venus of 1769.

He graduated at the top out of 80 cadets from the 15th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. His classmates included Takeo Hirose and Keisuke Okada. When Takarabe was courting the daughter of Admiral Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe, his close friend Takeo Hirose approached the admiral and requested that he refuse to allow his daughter to marry Takarabe. \\"Since Takarabe is a man of great talent and intelligence, he is destined to one day become an admiral. However, if he is married to your daughter, people will say that his advancement was due to family connections, rather than his abilities.\\" However, Yamamoto ignored Hirose and allowed Takarabe to marry his daughter. As Hirose had predicted, with each promotion and advancement Takarabe later made in his career, he had enemies and detractors who attributed it to his family ties, and who called him ‚Äúthe princeling‚Äù behind his back.Japanese wikipedia Takarabe served his midshipman tour on the corvette , and cruiser . After being commissioned as an ensign, he was assigned back to Takechiho, followed by the cruiser . From 1891 to 1892, he was appointed naval attach√© to France. Returning to attend navigational training in Japan, Takarabe was promoted to lieutenant in 1894 and assigned to the cruiser during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95), eventually becoming chief navigator. From June 1897 to April 1899 Takarabe was sent to Great Britain for studies. After his return to Japan, he was promoted to lieutenant commander and assigned to the destroyer , of which he became captain in 1900. He served in various postings within the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff thereafter, becoming a commander in September 1903. During the Russo-Japanese War, Takarabe served on the Imperial General Headquarters, formulating strategy and tactics. In 1905 he was promoted to captain, and after the end of the war, spent six months in England in 1907. From September 1907 to September 1908, Takarabe was captain of the cruiser , and from September‚ÄìDecember 1908 captain of the battleship . He served as chief of staff of the IJN 1st fleet in 1909, and became Vice Minister of the Navy on his promotion to rear admiral in December 1909. In December 1913, Takarabe was promoted to vice admiral. He was commander of the Ryojun Guard District in 1916, and commander in chief of the Maizuru Naval District in 1918, and commander in chief of the Sasebo Naval District in 1919. Takarabe was promoted to full admiral in November 1919. He became commander in chief of the Yokosuka Naval District from July 1922. From 15 May 1923 to 7 January 1924, Takarabe served as Naval Minister in the cabinets of Prime Minister Kat≈ç Tomosabur≈ç and Prime Minister Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe. Takarabe was Navy Minister again from 11 June 1924 to 20 April 1927 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Kat≈ç Takaaki and first cabinet of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç, and once more from 2 July 1929 to 18 November 1929 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi. From 1929‚Äì1930, Takarabe was on the Japanese delegation at the London Naval Treaty negotiations. Takarabe was considered a political moderate, and was a leading member of the Treaty Faction within the Imperial Japanese Navy. He strongly opposed the growing militarization of Japan, and sought to maintain diplomatic ties with Great Britain in hopes of reviving the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. His support of the London Treaty and disarmament led Takarabe to be branded a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù by the rightists and by the Fleet Faction members of the Navy, and also led to an assassination attempt. During his final term in office, the military was embroiled with the chain of command controversy as to whether or not the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy were answerable to the elected Diet of Japan and the Prime Minister, or were answerable only directly to the Emperor of Japan. Takarabe went into the reserves in 1932, and retired in 1937.

Service Mrs Pridham, the wife of the Mayor of Plymouth, Mr Joseph Pridham, launched her on 23 March 1810. Captain Adam Mackenzie commissioned her for the Texel. On 9 November 1810, Armada was among the vessels in sight when the 36-gun fifth rate captured the French privateer Venus. Then on 22 November, Armada was in the company of the 74-gun when Northumberland captured the 14-gun French privateer ketch Glaneuse of Saint Maloes, which was under the command of a Dane, Mr. Anthe Haste. Glaneuse was only six months old and was six weeks into her first cruise, having made no captures. Blockade of Toulon, 1810-1814: Pellew's action, 5 November 1813, by thumb On 1 February 1811 Armada was one of a number of vessels that were in company when captured the American schooner Beauty. In January 1812 Captain R.F. Devonshire briefly took command. That same month Captain Charles Grant replaced him. On 23 July 1813, the seas pushed Armada into range of French batteries at Borgidhero. The batteries opened fire but the shots went over Armada. Armada landed her marines who captured the eastern battery and then entered the battery on the point of Borgidhero after the French had tried to blow it up. The marines spiked the guns. The landing party took fire from the nearby town so the frigates accompanying Armada fired on the town while the landing party burnt some vessels on the shore. Armada suffered two men wounded in the engagement. On 4 November 1813 Armada arrived off Cap Sici√© and the next day was involved in a skirmish with a French squadron off Toulon. Admiral Sir Edward Pellew's inshore squadron consisted of the 74-gun third rates Scipion, , , and Armada, Captains Henry Heathcote, Thomas James Maling, James Brisbane, and Charles Grant. The 74-gun third rate Pomp√©e, Captain Sir James Athol Wood, joined them. These vessels opened fire on the French fleet consisting of 14 sail of the line and seven frigates, which had sortied from Toulon on a training exercise. Pellew and the main body of his force soon arrived to join the fray. Neither side accomplished much as the French rapidly returned to port. Armada had no casualties though one shot did hit her, and in all the British suffered 12 men wounded by enemy fire and one man killed and two wounded in an accident. Pellew mentioned in his letter that the only reason he had reported the incident was to provide an accurate account to counteract French propaganda. The French suffered 17 wounded. On 9 December Armada was with a squadron under Captain Josiah Rowley of and assisted in supporting the landing of troops at Via Reggio. Armada had met up with the squadron, which had sailed up from Palermo, off Corsica a few days earlier. The troops, 1000 men of the Italian Levy under the command of Lieut-Colonel Catanelli, marched inland and captured Lucca. They then returned to Via Reggio. There was further fighting around Pisa and Via Reggio before the expedition re-embarked aboard the British warships. In November and December and made a number of captures. Armada shared in the prize money by agreement with Berwick. Armada benefited from the capture of the St Anne and two French ships taken on 13 and 16 November, the schooner Air taken on 11 December, and the Antoine Camille and Resurrection taken on 17 December. On 12 February 1814 Armada was a part of the fleet off Toulon that chased a French squadron into that port. Armada herself did not take part in any action. On 23 April, Armada and Curacoa, together with 12 Sicilian gunboats, arrived at Savona to support a British and Sicilian force besieging the fortress there. When the French commander declined to surrender, the British warships, the gunboats and a battery commenced a cannonade. After an hour the French capitulated. Under the terms of surrender they were permitted to march out and return to Italy. The British and Sicilian force captured 110 cannon. On 1 September Armada was escorting ten merchant vessels to Gibraltar. Some 200 miles west of Ushant, the convoy encountered the sloop USS Wasp, which was operating out of Lorient. Wasp made for the convoy and singled out the brig Mary, laden with iron and brass cannon and other military stores, which she quickly captured, carrying off Marys crew as prisoners before burning her. Wasp then attempted to take another ship in the convoy, but Armada was able to chase her off. Fate By 1815 Armada was out of commission at Plymouth, and remained so for the rest of her life. The Admiralty used her as a powder hulk at Keyham Point from April 1844. An Admiralty order in 1862 mandated that her sister ship would replace her.Winfield (2008), p.80.

Biography Murakami was born in Saga Prefecture as the eldest son to a samurai of Saga Domain. He moved to Ibaraki prefecture when his father was appointed an official under the new Meiji government and initially intended to study medicine. He graduated from the 11th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, ranked 2nd out of 26 cadets. He served on a number of ships in the early Imperial Japanese Navy, including the corvettes , , , and the cruiser . Promoted to lieutenant in 1889, he was a specialist in torpedo warfare and was assigned as chief torpedo officer on the cruiser in 1893 on its year-long voyage to the United Kingdom. After the end of the First Sino-Japanese War, Murakami was sent as a naval attach√© to France from June 1897 to May 1900. During his time in France, he was promoted to lieutenant commander, and then to commander. On his return, he served in a number of staff positions before he was appointed executive officer to the in 1902. In July 1903, he received his first command, the cruiser . He was promoted to captain the same year and continued as captain of Chiyoda in the early stages of the Russo-Japanese War. On 12 January 1905, he became captain of the cruiser . Murakami was promoted to rear admiral on 28 August 1908 and vice admiral on 1 December 1912, from which time he was director of the Kure Naval Arsenal, followed by Naval Shipbuilding Command. It was largely at his insistence that the new battlecruiser was equipped with 14 inch guns instead of 12 inch guns as originally planned. However, Murakami's plans for further modernization of the Imperial Japanese Navy and introduction of new technologies were brought to a halt by the Siemens scandal. During World War I, from December 1915 to April 1917, Murakami was commander in chief of the IJN 3rd Fleet, and played an active role in the Battle of Tsingtao and the occupation of German colonies in the South Pacific. From 1917-1918, he was in charge of the Naval Training Bureau, and became a full admiral on 2 July 1918. From December 1919 to July 1922, he was commander in chief of the Kure Naval District. He subsequently served on the Supreme War Council. From 7 January 1924 to 11 June 1924, Murakami served as Naval Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Keigo Kiyoura. He went into the reserves in 1924, and died in 1927.

In 1812 she was part of a British squadron consisting of the frigate , and Swallow when they intercepted a French convoy that had left Genoa on 11 June, heading for Toulon. The convoy consisted of 14 merchant vessels, several gunboats, and most importantly, the brig-corvette , of 16 guns, under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Charles Baudin, and the schooner Go√©land, of 12 guns, under the command of Enseigne de vaisseau Belin. The British on 15 June drove the French to take shelter at the √éle Sainte-Marguerite. The next day Swallow came close to reconnoitre, the other two British ships having to hold off because of shallow water. Although the French escorts came out when they saw Swallow becalmed, they then turned back when the winds picked up and took their convoy to Fr√©jus. There the French escort vessels took on board some reinforcements and then turned to engage Swallow. A sanguine but inconclusive action ensued. Eventually, Swallow hauled off to rejoin the two larger British ships, which were coming up, while Renard and Go√©land rejoined their convoy, now in the Bay of Grimaud. The action cost Swallow six men killed and 17 wounded, out of 109 men on board. Renard had a crew of 94, which had been doubled by the troops taken on at Fr√©jus. In all she lost 14 men killed and 28 wounded, including her captain, Lieutenant Baudin. Go√©land had a crew of 113 men but her casualties are not known. She did not engage deeply in the battle, though she did exchange some fire with Swallow.James (1837), Vol. 6, pp. 101-4. In 1827 America was cut down into a fourth rate.

He was awarded the Templeton Prize in 1980.  Biography  Ralph Wendell Burhoe was born on 21 June 1911, in Somerville, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard University from 1928 to 1932 as a student of meteorology and climatology, though never completing his degree. He then entered Andover Newton Theological School.Theology in a Global Context: The Last Two Hundred Years, Hans Schwarz, Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2005, , , 597 pages, p.561-562 Burhoe spent eighteen months in theological study at Andover.

Brown escorted to Portugal a large body of troops sent as reinforcements to the Duke of Wellington's army there. Vengeur then cruised the Western Isles to protect an inbound fleet of East Indiamen. Brown's replacement in November 1811 was Captain James Brisbane. Robert Tristram Ricketts took command of Vengeur in October 1813. Vengeur, , and were in company on 6 March 1814 at the recapture of the Diamond. In May 1814 the 9th Regiment of Foot marched from Bayonne to Bordeaux and embarked on York and Vengeur to sail to Quebec to lend support to the British Army in the fight against the Americans during the War of 1812. Vengeur then joined Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane's fleet moored off New Orleans. The Commanding Officer of the Vengeurs Marine detachment, Brevet Major Thomas Adair, was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for leading a party of 100 Royal Marines on a successful assault of the left bank of the Mississippi River. Although the strongpoint was taken, and seventeen cannon were captured, the battle was lost as the right bank remained impregnable. Of the two fatalities among the Royal Marines, one was from HMS Vengeur. Ricketts commanded the British naval forces at the Second Battle of Fort Bowyer, the British attack on the American fort at Mobile Point in 1815. The British then attacked and captured Fort Bowyer at the mouth of Mobile Bay on 12 February. The British were making preparations to attack Mobile when news arrived of the peace treaty. The Treaty of Ghent had been ratified by the British Parliament but would not be ratified by Congress and the President until mid-February. Captain Thomas Alexander took command in August 1815. Vengeur served as a guardship at Portsmouth from June 1816 to May 1818. From October to December she was fitted out for sea. Frederick Lewis Maitland took command of Vengeur in October 1818, and in 1819 sailed her to South America. He took Lord George Beresford from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon in 1820, and then returned to the Mediterranean. He then carried Ferdinand I, King of the Two Sicilies from Naples to Livorno, on his way to attend the Congress of Laibach (modern Ljubljana). The passage was rough and lasted seven days, but they arrived safely on 20 December. After His Majesty landed, he personally invested Maitland with the insignia of a knight- commander of the order of St. Ferdinand and of Merit, and gave him a gold box with the king's portrait set in diamonds.Anderson (1862), Vol. 2, p.637. Maitland and Vengeur then returned to England, arriving at Spithead on 29 March 1821. Vengeur was found to be defective and was paid off on 18 May 1821 at Sheerness.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.400.

Biography In 1215, David was ordained maphrian by John XII upon which he took the name Ignatius and was maphrian for seven years before being consecrated patriarch in 1222, which was also the year he ordained Mor Dionysius Sleeba as maphrian. A diplomatic mission carried out by David and the Armenian Catholicos Constantine I of Cilicia in 1225 attempted to end hostilities between Isabella, Queen of Armenia and the usurper Constantine of Baberon. In 1232, David ordained the future patriarch John V bar Ma ødani as maphrian. The former maphrian, Ignatius Sleeba III of Edessa, after having retired and became a physician, is known to have treated David, who suffered from gout. During David's tenure as patriarch, a dispute arose between the Syriac Orthodox Church and Pope Cyril III of Alexandria of the Coptic Orthodox Church, who, in 1237, had taken advantage of the military strength of the Ayyubid Sultanate to appoint a Coptic bishop of Jerusalem. The new bishop was granted jurisdiction over Ayyubid and crusader territories in Syria and Palestine, an area traditionally within the jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Church and thus created friction between the churches. Simultaneously, David was approached by an Ethiopian faction within the Coptic Orthodox Church and asked to ordain an Ethiopian as an abuna, the head of the church in Ethiopia. He discussed the issue with the newly arrived Dominicans who offered to mediate the dispute and forbade the appointment of an abuna, however, David spurned the Dominicans' offer and ordained a new abuna. Upon hearing of the appointment of a new abuna, the Dominicans incited the Templar and Hospitaller knights to meet with David and demand an explanation. This was a very rare incident between the two churches as in general their relationship is one of the strongest between any two churches.History of the Coptic Church, Abouna Menassa Elkomos Youhanna 1923 In the closing years of his tenure as patriarch, David entered a quarrel with the metropolitan bishop Dionysius Angur of Melitene.

Dean Ho competed in North American promotions including Pacific Northwest Wrestling, the World Wide Wrestling Federation and Big Time Wrestling during the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. A longtime veteran of the Vancouver's NWA All-Star Wrestling, he feuded with Terry Adonis, The Brute and former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Gene Kiniski. Bodybuilding career After graduating from President Theodore Roosevelt High School, Higuchi was one of Hawaii's prominent bodybuilders during the 1950s winning the title \\"Mr. Hawaiian Islands\\" competition in 1956 and finishing sixth place in the \\"Mr. America\\" competition in Philadelphia. =Dean's Gym= He opened his gym on Kalakaua Avenue in 1957, and it was a popular training center for both bodybuilders and professional wrestlers. Many of the areas top bodybuilders such as Mike Brown and professional wrestlers trained for decades including Don Muraco, Beauregarde, Rene Goulet and Karl Gotch. Professional wrestling career =Early career= Making his professional wrestling debut during the early 1960s, he lost one of his earliest matches to Rocky Columbo in Portland, Oregon on April 6, 1962. During the mid-1960s, Higuchi began competing for promoter Ed Francis's Pacific Northwest Wrestling feuding with El Shereeh and also teaming with Kazimoto and Al Torres during early 1965. Later, while in Francis's Big Time Wrestling, he appeared in televised matches against Fuji Fujiwara, Bill Dromo, Tosh Togo, Nick Kozak, Kongozan and the Mongolian Stomper at the Honolulu Civic Auditorium during 1966. After losing to Hans Mortier and Johnny Barend in early 1967, Higuchi wrestled two matches in one night defeating Great Fuji although he lost a later tag team match with Karl Gotch against Curtis Iaukea and Ripper Collins on April 5, 1967, before moving to the mainland by the end of the year. =National Wrestling Alliance= Feuding with then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Gene Kiniski in 1968, he lost two matches title matches to him on October 21 and again on December 16 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The following year, he would avenge his loss teaming with Earl Maynard to defeat Kiniski and Bad Boy Shields in a tournament final for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship in Vancouver on May 12, 1969. Continuing his long-running feud with Kiniski, he and Steve Bolus fought to a time limit draw against Kiniski and Angelo Mosca on January 26 and, with Tex McKenzie, defeated Gene Kiniski and Moose Morowski on April 28, 1970. Losing the title less than a month later to Dutch Savage and \\"Bulldog\\" Bob Brown on June 9, he and Steve Bolus defeated them on December 8 and held them until their defeat by Brown and John Quinn on February 9, 1970. He later won the tag team title with Steven Little Bear twice during 1971 and feuded with the Skull Brothers and Gene Kiniski and Bob Brown before losing the title to Kiniski and Brown for the second and final time on October 11, 1971. Staying in Vancouver in early 1973, he defeated Sailor White on January 22. Feuding with The Brute, he and Sean Reagan lost a tag team match to The Brute and Mike Webster in Seattle on March 3. After defeating Tony Bourne, Butts Giraud and Bob Hames in a 6-man tag-team match with Larry Whistler and Eric Froelich on July 16, he left the promotion moving on to the northeastern United States. While wrestling in Georgia Championship Wrestling, he held the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship with Ken Mantell defeating Black Gordman and Goliath on July 2 before losing them to Jimmy and Johnny Valiant a little more than two weeks later on July 16, 1976. He also helped Rick \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, who was also wrestling in Georgia at the time, develop his martial arts and ring psychology during his early career. =World Wide Wrestling Federation= Wrestling for the World Wide Wrestling Federation during the mid-1970s, he and Tony Garea teamed to defeat Toru Tanaka and Mr. Fuji to win the WWWF World Tag Team Championship on November 14, 1973.

They continued to team for a time defeating Jack Evans and Hans Schroeder on November 24 however, by summer 1975, they had gone their separate ways. Later that year, Ho left the WWWF. =From San Francisco to Vancouver= Returning to Vancouver for a time, he and George Wells defeated Dale Lewis and Seigfried Steinke on January 12, 1976 before losing them to his longtime rival Gene Kiniski and Seigfried Steinke on February 9. In 1977, Higuchi began wrestling in the San Francisco-area defeating Alexis Smirnoff for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship in Daly City, California on July 16 holding the title for two months before losing the title to Bob Roop on September 17. Higuchi later regained the title, which had been vacated after Roop left the company in December 1977, winning a tournament on January 14, 1978.

The subsequent meta-analysis of this game gives insight in possible strategies and their outcome. Origin Metagame theory was developed by Nigel Howard in the 1960s as a reconstruction of mathematical game theory on a non-quantitative basis, hoping that it would thereby make more practical and intuitive sense . Metagame analysis reflects on a problem in terms of decision issues, and stakeholders who may exert different options to gain control over these issues. The analysis reveals what likely scenarios exist, and who has the power to control the course of events. The practical application of metagame theory is based on the analysis of options method, first applied to study problems like the strategic arms race and nuclear proliferation. Method Metagame analysis proceeds in three phases: analysis of options, scenario development, and scenario analysis. =Analysis of options= The first phase of analysis of options consists of the following four steps: #Structure the problem by identifying the issues to be decided. #Identify the stakeholders who control the issues, either directly or indirectly. #Make an inventory of policy options by means of which the stakeholders control the issues. #Determine the dependencies between the policy options. The dependencies between options should typically be formulated as \\"option X can only be implemented if option Y is also implemented\\", or \\"options Y and Z are mutually exclusive\\". The result is a metagame model, which can then be analysed in different ways. =Scenario development= The possible outcomes of the game, based on the combination of options, are called scenarios. In theory, a game with N stakeholders s1, ..., sN who have Oi options (i = 1, ..., N), there are O1√ó...√óON possible outcomes. As the number of stakeholders and the number of the options they have increase, the number of scenarios will increase steeply due to a combinatorial explosion. Conversely, the dependencies between options will reduce the number of scenarios, because they rule out those containing logically or physically impossible combinations of options. If the set of feasible scenarios is too large to be analysed in full, some combinations may be eliminated because the analyst judges them to be not worth considering. When doing so, the analyst should take care to preserve these particular types of scenarios : *The Status Quo, representing the future as it was previously expected. *The present scenario, which may differ from the Status Quo as it incorporates the intentions that are expressed by the stakeholders to change their plans; the Status Quo necessarily remains the same, but the present scenario may change as stakeholders interact and influence each other's plans. *The positions of different stakeholders, being the scenarios they would like others to agree to. Similar to the present scenario, positions may change through interaction. *Compromises between two stakeholders, defined as scenarios that, while not the position of either, are preferred by both to the other's position. A compromise does not necessarily have to involve all stakeholders. *Conflict points, defined as scenarios that stakeholders might move to in trying to force others to accept their positions. =Scenario analysis= The next step in the metagame analysis consists of the actual analysis of the scenarios generated so far. This analysis centres around stability and is broken down in the following four steps : #Choose a particular scenario to analyse for stability. A scenario is stable if \\"each stakeholder expects to do its part and expects others to do theirs.\\" Note that stable scenarios are accepted by all stakeholders, but that acceptance does not need to be voluntary. There may be more than one stable scenario, the stability of a scenario may change, and unstable scenarios can also happen. #Identify all unilateral improvements for stakeholders and subsets of stakeholders from the particular scenario. These are all the scenarios that are both preferred by all members of a certain subset and 'reachable' by them alone changing their selection of individual options. #Identify all sanctions that exist to deter the unilateral improvements. A sanction against an improvement is a possible reaction to an improvement by the stakeholders who were not involved in the improvement. It is such that the stakeholder who was involved in the improvement finds the sanction not preferred to the particular scenario, making it not worthwhile for that stakeholder to have helped with the improvement. The general \\"law of stability\\" to be used in scenario analysis is: for a scenario to be stable, it is necessary for each credible improvement to be deterred by a credible sanction Steps 1 to 3 need to be repeated to analyse some additional scenarios. When a number of scenarios have been analysed, one can proceed to the next step: #Draw a strategic map, laying out all the threats and promises stakeholders can make to try to stabilise the situation at scenarios they prefer. Strategic maps are diagrams in which scenarios are shown by balloons, with arrows from one balloon to another representing unilateral improvements. Dotted arrows from improvement arrows to balloons represent sanctions by which the improvements may be deterred, thus changing the destination of the improvement arrow. This analysis procedure shows that the credibility of threats and promises (sanctions and improvements) is of importance in metagame analysis. A threat or promise, one that the stakeholder prefers to carry out for its own sake, is inherently credible. Sometimes a stakeholder may want to make credible an 'involuntary' threat or promise, to use this to move the situation in the desired direction. Such threats and promises can be made credible in three basic ways: preference change, irrationality, and deceit . Development Metagame analysis is still used as a technique in its own right. However it has been further developed in distinct ways as the basis of more recent approaches: * the graph model * confrontation analysis References  Game theory ","title":"Metagame analysis"},{"id":"13290764","text":"The Order of Aftab (Nishan-i-Aftab) was founded by Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar, the King of Persia, in February 1873, before his first visit to various European states.

Around the top half of the platinum band, a sunburst arranged in a fan-like design of seventeen separate rays, eight with tips shaped like Gothic arches and nine swallows tails, all completely encrusted in diamonds. Attached to the uppermost ray of the sunburst, a tie-ring encrusted in brilliants. The breast star of the first class is very similar to the badge, but larger, and consists of a sunburst with thirty-two separate rays, all encrusted in diamonds and completely surrounding the central disk with its wide platinum band and circlet of diamonds. Recipients of the first class wore the badge suspended from a grand cordon of pink moir√©, edged with narrow border stripes of green, pink, and green. The sash draped over the left shoulder and across the breast, with the badge resting below the right hip. Second Class insignia The insignia of the second class also consists of breast star, sash and sash badge. The badge is similar to the first class but in enamel and brilliants, instead of diamonds. Unlike the first class, the breast star of the second class is a closer copy of the badge, but with pendant diamonds from the two horizontal lower arms. The sunburst is semicircular with seventeen rays, surrounding only the top half of the central disk with its wide platinum band and circlet of diamonds. Recipients of the second class wore the badge suspended from the same grand cordon, and in the same manner, as those of the first class. Replacement By the fall of the Qajar dynasty and in the era of Reza Shah Pahlavi, this order was replaced by the Order of Khorshid (another Persian word for 'Sun') in 1939.

A fourth-generation wrestler, he was the son of British wrestler Jim Hussey and the father of boxer Jono \\"Rocco\\" Hussey. Regularly appearing on ITV's World of Sport, he feuded with many of the top light heavyweight wrestlers of the era including Marty Jones, the Dynamite Kid, \\"Iron Fist\\" Clive Myers, Kendo Nagasaki and Satoru Sayama (billed in the UK as \\"Sammy Lee) in England. He and Sayama also feuded in Japan while both under masks, Sayama as Tiger Mask and Rocco as his nemesis Black Tiger.Britain's Heroes and Villains by Navdeep Rehill, Grosvenor House, 2013, Career =Early career= Born in Manchester, Rocco grew up in his father's gym where other local wrestlers trained. Although his father was opposed to his being a professional wrestler, going so far as to have his son banned from his gym, Rocco would receive lessons from some of the veterans while his father was out on tour.Nagasaki, Kendo. The Grapple Manual: Heroes & Villains from the Golden Age of World Wrestling. New York: Sterling Publishing, 2005. Rocco started amateur wrestling at age 16, competing as far away as southern France and Pakistan, was definitely wrestling professionally by July 1970, being then a regular at Northern venues such as Liverpool Stadium and Blackpool Tower. In July 1970 he appeared on the bill with his father Jim Hussey in a match against Ivan Penzecoff at the Granada, East Ham in London. Making his debut in Dale Martin's London territory under the Joint Promotions banner, he became a rising star in the organisation, defeating Bert Royal (wrestler) for the British Heavy Middleweight Championship on 11 June 1977 and was involved in televised high-profile matches with Marty Jones before losing the title to him on 13 September 1978. After Jones vacated the title, Rocco regained the title after defeating then-rookie Chris Adams in a tournament final on 6 December 1978. Rocco lost the championship to Adams a few months later, and regained it towards the middle of 1979. Touring North America the following year, he teamed with Greg Gagne and briefly competed in the World Wide Wrestling Federation, one of his opponents being Terry Bollea. In 1981, Rocco had his first feud with Satoru Sayama, then wrestling in Britain as Sammy Lee. Rocco was scheduled to wrestle Lee for the World Heavy- Middleweight title (recognised as vacant by Joint Promotions) at Wembley Arena that year on the undercard of the famous Big Daddy versus Giant Haystacks grudge match, but this was cancelled after Lee returned to Japan due to a family bereavement. Rocco was awarded Joint Promotions recognition as champion by default that night; later that year he defeated Joel de Fremery at a TV taping in Southport for the main European version of the World Heavy Middleweight title. Vacating his British title to concentrate on the World title, Rocco feuded intensely with a returning Dynamite Kid, culminating in a World title match in Lewisham, South London that ended in a double knockout. =New Japan Pro Wrestling= After his series of highly regarded matches, Rocco was contacted by New Japan Pro Wrestling to wrestle a series of matches against Lee/Sayama in Japan. Wrestling under the name Black Tiger, against Sayama's Tiger Mask character, Rocco and Tiger Mask's matches were some of the highest-rated in Japanese television history. The success of this series of matches between the original Black Tiger and original Tiger Mask would be followed with later incarnations of wrestlers to have competed under both the Black Tiger and Tiger Mask names in later years. The rivalry between the two Tigers continued throughout 1982, as the two feuded over the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship after Rocco defeated Gran Hamada in a tournament final for the title in Fukuoka, Japan on 6 May before losing it back to Tiger Mask less than a month later in Tokyo, Japan on 26 May 1982. Rocco made further visits to Japan in the late 1980s where he and Keiichi Yamada would recreate their UK feud. In 1989, as Black Tiger, Rocco fought with Yamada's own superhero alter ego, Jushin Liger. He was also involved in Liger's early training. =All Star Wrestling= Back home in Britain, Rocco was lured away from the TV/Joint Promotions spotlight by independent promoter Orig Williams. Crucial to the defection was that Rocco brought his World Heavy Middleweight championship with him.El Bandito: Orig Williams The Autobiography - Orig Williams, Y Llolfa 2010 Rocco agreed and made the jump, also working for promoter Brian Dixon, whose Wrestling Enterprises promotion evolved into All Star Wrestling. When not on tour in Japan or elsewhere overseas, Rocco would continue to work for Dixon for the remainder of his career. Dixon would later comment that Rocco was his best employee, both as a worker and as a loyal friend.The Wrestling, Simon Garfield, Faber & Faber 1995 In 1983, Rocco appeared during All Star Wrestling's national tour of Great Britain and issued an open challenge for a non-title match to any wrestler in the promotion. Accepted by Frank \\"Chic\\" Cullen, he was defeated by Rocco although they shook hands following the match. During the second week of the tour, after defeating Mike Jordan in a singles match, Rocco challenged the Dynamite Kid who had also recently returned from NJPW to a match later that night. Agreeing to a tag team match, he and Fit Finlay would later lose to Dynamite Kid and Marty Jones at the end of the night after Dynamite Kid pinned Finlay. The following week he again challenged the Dynamite Kid challenging him to a 30-minute \\"iron man\\" match which resulted in a time limit draw with one pinfall each. This led to a brutal feud between the two, which would lead to many aggressive, bloody encounters, culminating in the Dynamite Kid challenging Rocco to a ladder match for his World Heavy Middleweight title. Rocco successfully defended the title after he had tied the Dynamite Kid's arms to the cord of the area curtains. He would later defend the title in a rematch against Cullen, Robbie Brookside and his former tag team partner The Cobra during the last weeks of the tour. In late 1985, Rocco lost his title to Cullen but regained it a few days later. The following year, he faced the challenge of Yamada, now billed by All Star as \\"Flying\\" Fuji Yamada. During the second half of 1986, Rocco lost his title to Yamada, regained it and then lost it again. During this feud, All Star finally gained a share of ITV's wrestling coverage and so when Rocco finally won the belt back in Lewisham in March 1987, it was televised nationally. =Tag team and feud with Kendo Nagasaki= Another televised confrontation between Rocco and Yamada would come in 1987, on opposite sides of a tag match. Yamada and his tag partner in Britain, \\"Ironfist\\" Clive Myers had challenged legendary masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki to a tag team match and, having a shared rival in Yamada, Rocco volunteered. Nagasaki and Rocco defeated Yamada and Myers in the main event of a TV taping at the Fairfield Hall Croydon. Following this match, Nagasaki and Rocco would continue to team until a year later at another televised Croydon tag match, where the team collapsed in spectacular fashion while facing Myers and Dave Taylor. Taylor was attempting, mid-match, to unmask Nagasaki and had nearly succeeded when Rocco intervened. Rocco attempted to pull the mask back down, but Taylor forearm-smashed Rocco, causing the mask to come off in his hands. As Taylor and Myers celebrated, Nagasaki fled to the dressing room and returned with another mask. Nagasaki's manager George Gillette blamed Rocco for the unmasking, igniting a major feud that would run on into the early 1990s. =Tours of mainland Europe= In June 1988, he teamed with Dave Finlay losing to Mile Zrno & Tony St. Clair in a match to crown the first CWA World Tag Team Champions in Linz, Austria. Rocco also wrestled in France for Roger Delaporte's F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Catch Professionnel. One of his last World Heavy Middleweight title defences, against Danny Boy Collins in Paris, France in 1991, was aired on Eurosport's New Catch programme, with Williams providing English commentary. =Retirement= In 1991, Rocco collapsed in the dressing room following a match against Fit Finlay in Worthing. Rocco, who had been suffering from pain in his back and kidneys since a match against Dave Taylor the previous night, was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors found his heart was working at only 30% and diagnosed him with a heart condition which forced him to retire from professional wrestling.Symkus, Ed and Vinnie Carolan. Wrestle Radio U.S.A.: Grapplers Speak. Toronto: ECW Press, 2004. In the 1990s, Rocco emigrated to Tenerife. =2002‚Äì2013= Following the retirement of Cullen in 2002, ten years into an unbeaten reign with Rocco's old World Heavy-Middleweight title, the following year Rocco and Cullen came together to oversee a tournament to crown a successor, won by future WWE star \\"American Dragon\\" Brian Danielson, to whom Rocco and Cullen personally presented the belt. In August 2006, he and his father received a lifetime achievement award at the 15th Southern Wrestlers‚Äô Reunion at South Darenth, Kent. During the event, Rocco also presented a lifetime achievement award to promoter Brian Dixon. Rollerball Rocco was the subject of the 2011 song \\"Inside the Restless Mind of Rollerball Rocco\\" by English musician Luke Haines. It is featured on Haines' psychedelic rock concept album about British wrestlers entitled \\"9 1/2 Psychedelic Meditations On British Wrestling Of The 1970's And Early 1980's\\". In September 2012, Rocco was named as one of the mentors on the Challenge reality television programme TNA Wrestling: British Boot Camp. In June 2013, he was interviewed on The Art of Wrestling with Colt Cabana.

On 16 September 2007, about 15:41 ICT, the McDonnell Douglas MD-82 operating the flight crashed into an embankment beside runway 27 at Phuket International Airport (HKT) bursting into flames upon impact during an attempted go-around after an aborted landing, killing 90 of the 130 persons on board (this includes one person who died of burn injuries several days after the crash). The crash report was published by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee (AAIC) of the Ministry of Transport. A separate two-year report done by the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was incorporated into the AAIC report. Both reports found that the captain and first officer had worked hours in excess of the legal flight limits; that the first officer attempted to transfer control to the captain during the go-around; that neither pilot initiated a go-around and that the training and safety programs at the airline were deficient. Between 2009 and 2010 One-Two-Go Airlines was prohibited from operating in European Union nations due to safety concerns. At the time of the accident the airline was owned by Orient Thai Airlines and in July 2010, it fully re-branded as Orient Thai Airlines. Crash Trans World Airlines (TWA). On the day of the crash, the McDonnell Douglas MD-82 departed Bangkok's Don Mueang International Airport, Thailand at 14:31 en route to Phuket International Airport as flight number OG269. The flight crew consisted of Captain Arief Mulyadi (57), an Indonesian national and the Chief Pilot of One-Two-Go Airlines, and a former Indonesian Air Force pilot, and First Officer Montri Kamolrattanachai (30), a Thai national who had recently completed his flight training with One-Two-GO's ab initio program. Arief had 16,752 flight hours, including 4,330 hours on the MD-82, while Montri had 1,465 hours, 1,240 of them on the MD-82. The aircraft was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members. OG269 was the fourth of six flights between Bangkok and Phuket that Arief and Montri were scheduled to fly that day. On approach to Phuket, Captain Arief made several radio communications errors including read-back/hear-back communications and misstating their flight number. First Officer Montri was the flying pilot. Another aircraft landed immediately prior to Flight 269 and experienced wind shear. That aircraft's captain contacted the tower and reported wind shear on final and cumulonimbus over the airport, a report audible to all incoming aircraft. Air Traffic Control requested Flight 269 acknowledge the weather information provided and re-state intentions. Captain Arief acknowledged the transmission and stated his intention to land. OG269 conducted an ILS approach just north of the centerline on runway 27. As the landing proceeded, ATC reported increasing winds at 240 degrees from , then to . Captain Arief acknowledged the reports. ATC requested intentions again. Captain Arief said, \\"Landing\\". As the aircraft descended to above threshold level (ATL), its airspeed dropped. Captain Arief repeatedly called for more power as First Officer Montri attempted the landing. The aircraft continued to descend and fell below ATL, causing the auto-throttle to reduce engine thrust to idle. One second later, First Officer Montri called \\"Go Around\\". This was acknowledged by the captain. The first officer then attempted to transfer control of the aircraft to Captain Arief. There was no verbal acknowledgement of this from Captain Arief. The pilots retracted the landing gear and set flaps for go-around. The aircraft pitch changed from 2 degrees to 12 degrees as the aircraft climbed, its engines still at idle. Airspeed fell and the aircraft climbed to a maximum altitude of ATL before beginning to descend. For 13 seconds the engines remained at idle. The aircraft pitch angle decreased to near zero and then the throttle was manually increased two seconds before impact with an embankment along the runway at 15:40. The aircraft was destroyed on impact along with a post-crash fire.  Recovery  Rescue efforts were hampered by a four-foot (1.3 m) ditch beside and parallel to runway 27 running the length of the runway. Rescue vehicles were unable to cross this ditch, though they could have entered at either end of the runway, which none did. One survivor complained that only a single ambulance arrived. Additional fire and rescue from the town of Phuket arrived 30 minutes later. Additionally, the airport failed to include \\"crash on airport\\" procedures in its air service manual as required by ICAO.  Survivors and fatalities  Phuket International Airport Of the 130 people on board, 85 passengers and five crew members (including both flight crew members) died. The airline contacted the rest of the victims' families for evidence to aid in identification. Some victims suffered head injuries caused by dislodged baggage. Others were trapped and burned alive in the cabin. Many survivors sustained burns. Various embassies and ministries in Bangkok confirmed the following numbers: * Australian embassy: 1 Australian killed and 1 survived (National Nine News reported at 15:00 on 18 September that Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer and his department felt confident that no more than two Australians died in the crash.) * British embassy: Eight Britons killed and at least two injured * Canada: one killed and one injured * French foreign ministry: Three French nationals killed, one injured, six missing * German officials: At least one German killed - a 29-year-old man, four injured * Ireland foreign ministry: One Irish national killed * Israel media: Eight Israelis killed, two injured * Swedish foreign ministry: Two Swedes killed - a 19-year-old female and a 20-year-old male, and two survived with minor injuries * US embassy: Five American tourists killed * Japan: one killed, two injured * Turkey: one killed, one injured Investigation According to Vutichai Singhamany, a safety director at Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation and the lead crash investigator, the pilot had deployed the landing gear on approach to Phuket airport runway 27, but had retracted it when attempting a go-around. Singhamany added that the wheels had not touched the runway and that the accident had happened moments after the pilot raised the nose of the aircraft to abort the landing. At the time of the crash, speculation rested on the pilot's decision to land in poor weather conditions and on the airport's wind shear detection system, which was not operational that day. In the weeks after the crash, Singhamany continued to indicate wind shear as the likely cause. As the accident involved a U.S. manufactured aircraft, the United States National Transportation Safety Board participated in the accident and arrived on site within days. The NTSB inspected the aircraft and the crash scene, and interviewed survivors and witnesses. They took information obtained from the flight data recorder (\\"black box\\") to the United States for analysis. The flight data recorder immediately yielded significant facts about the flight, including: * Wind shear was not a factor in the crash * First Officer Montri was the pilot flying * Captain Arief's radio communications with ATC were error prone * Many Crew Resource Management (CRM) issues occurred in the cockpit * There was no conversation between the pilots during the final 18 seconds of flight. * The go-around (TO/GA) button, used to configure the aircraft for go-around, had not been pushed * The throttle was pushed to take-off power only two seconds before impact.  Conclusions  After completing the inspection of the aircraft, the NTSB found it to have functioned properly and to have remained fully controllable until impact. The cause of the crash was found to be due to a combination of human performance and operational issues, including: Human Performance: * CRM issues, including attempted transfer of control of the aircraft at a critical moment * Failure of either pilot to apply power while attempting to regain altitude * Fatigue issues as both pilots had worked excessive hours for the week and the month Operational: * Lack of governance in the corporate culture at One-Two-GO airlines * Failure of One-Two-Go to complete pilot proficiency checks as required by law * Training on a simulator that did not include wind shear alerting and did not match the configuration of One-Two-GO's MD-82s. The NTSB noted that, \\"although the weather deteriorated in the later stages of this flight, wind shear was not a factor in this accident‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt is understood that during the accident sequence, the pilots were potentially distracted by the weather conditions; however, that distraction should not cause a loss of control of the airplane.\\" The U.S. NTSB stated that the possible causes of this accident, consistent with available evidence, are that: The crew did not properly perform the go-around and failed to activate the TO/GA switch. Although the throttles remained available to the crew to advance power, they did not, nor did they monitor the throttles during the go- around. A transfer of controls, from the copilot to the pilot, occurred at a critical point in the go-around. The airplane's flight management system automatically retarded the throttles, since the approach slat/flap logic for landing was met. Lacking power application, the airplane slowed and descended until contact with the terrain. The Thai AAIC added that the flight crew did not follow the standard operating procedure of a stabilized approach, call outs, and emergency situations as specified in the airline's flight operation manual. Their co-ordination was insufficient, they had heavy workloads and accumulated stress, had insufficient rest, and were fatigued. The weather conditions changed suddenly prompting the go-around attempt.  Aftermath  On 28 July 2008, Thai DCAT censured Orient Thai Airlines and One-Two-Go airlines over a number of issues, including: * Failure to have safety and oversight programs to ensure pilots were properly trained and certified * Failure to have a system and oversight over a system to ensure pilots met and did not exceed duty time limitations * Committing offense and breaking the law by submitting deceptive check ride reports by MD-80 pilots The Air Operator's Certificate of One-Two-GO Airlines was revoked, grounding the airline for 30 days. In April 2009, One-Two-GO Airlines was added to the EU blacklist. It was removed shortly thereafter. In September 2010, the One-Two-GO brand was dropped and the airline was merged with Orient Thai Airlines.

He established it in 1921 at Lahore, British India, 26 years before the Partition of British India. History Sir Ganga Ram Hospital was established in 1921, at the end of WWI in the walled city of Lahore, India. The benefactor, Sir Ganga Ram, was a civil engineer and leading philanthropist of his time who also donated land for the site. In 1943 during WWII, the hospital was shifted to its present location to cope with the growing demand for medical and health care services. After Partition, India, built another \\"Sir Ganga Ram Hospital\\" in New Delhi. Associated medical college In 1944 the family of Sir Ganga Ram started a medical college by the name Balak Ram Medical College named after a son of Sir Ganga Ram. The college was closed soon after independence in 1947 and its premises abandoned. Fatima Jinnah Medical College, Lahore was established in 1948 in the same premises and named after Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is now an affiliated hospital to the Fatima Jinnah Medical College. It is now being extended over another 22 kanals land and will provide an additional 400 beds. The name of this new hospital (extension) is Fatima Jinnah Hospital. Although it is an all female medical college, the faculty consists of highly qualified male as well as female teachers. The college has well-equipped laboratories, airconditioned dissection hall, lecture theatres with audio-visual aids for teaching purposes, pathology museum, clinical academic rooms, a well-equipped library and an auditorium for seminars and international conferences. A purpose-built accident and emergency department has been added. The hostel for students is within walking distance from the college. It consists of six blocks. Two new blocks are being built to accommodate more students. At the moment there are around one thousand students living in the hostel. In literature A marble statue of Sir Ganga Ram once stood in a public square on Mall Road in Lahore. Famous Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto (known for his famous satire \\"Toba Tek Singh\\") wrote a satire on persons who were trying to obliterate any memory of any Hindu in Lahore after Pakistan came into existence. In his story \\"Garland\\" based on a true incident on the frenzy of religious riots of 1947, an inflamed mob in Lahore, after attacking a residential area, turned to attacking the statue of Sir Ganga Ram, the great Hindu philanthropist of Lahore. They first pelted the statue with stones; then smothered its face with coal tar. Then a man made a garland of old shoes climbed up to put it round the neck of the statue. The police arrived and opened fire. Among the injured were the fellow with the garland of old shoes. As he fell, the mob shouted: ‚ÄúLet us rush him to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital‚Äù forgetting that they were trying to obliterate the memory of the very person who had founded the hospital where the person was to be taken for saving his life.http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays- News-9-107485-Manto-from-heavenThe Public Sculptures of Historic Lahore, Raza Rumi, Posted on April 17, 2007 References External links *Ganga Ram Rai Bahadur Life complete history and Sir Ganga Ram hospital history latest jobs 2015-16 *About Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan *About Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India *Govind Ram Medical Support Groups of India Hospital buildings completed in 1921 Hospital buildings completed in 1943 Teaching hospitals in Pakistan Hospitals in Lahore Hospitals established in 1921 1921 establishments in British India ","title":"Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (Pakistan)"},{"id":"13291001","text":"Y√ºmai (‡Ω°‡Ω¥‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æ®‡Ωë‡ºã) / Yumai is a township in Lh√ºnz√™ County in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China.

It was the first Protestant church established in the country. History Greek Evangelical Church dates back to 1858 when the first Greek Evangelical, Michail Kalapothakis started publishing the magazine Astir tis Anatolis (Star of the East) which is still published today. He gathered a group of followers thus forming the first Greek Evangelical community and organized Sunday School for children as well as issuing the Efimeris ton Paidon (Newspaper of the Children) in 1868. The first Greek Evangelical Church was built in 1871 in the center of Athens, which was demolished and rebuilt in 1956 due to the increasing number of followers. Greek Evangelicalism spread also through the Greeks in the Ottoman Empire, the first Greek Evangelical community in Asia Minor was founded in 1867. Today there are 30 Greek Evangelical Churches in Greece, 3 in Cyprus and 5 in the Greek diaspora. Theology The Greek Evangelical Church is theologically Calvinist. Core beliefs are typical of most traditional Protestant denominations: they consider the Bible the highest and only binding authority on matters of doctrine and practice (sola scriptura) and recognize two sacraments (baptism and holy communion). Their Confession of Faith closely follows the Puritan Westminster Confession and consists of 28 articles. Affiliations The Greek Evangelical Church is affiliated with the World Communion of Reformed Churches and the World Council of Churches.

Investment types  Investments may include, but are not restricted to, certificates of deposit (CD), US Treasuries, US Agencies, repurchase agreements, and commercial paper.  Regulation  Similar to any fund, a GIP follows a set of investment guidelines imposed by the board. Even though the SEC does not regulate GIPs, the pools seek to maintain safe investment strategies. Many states adopted guidelines recommended by various public associations, such as the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), the Association of Public Treasurers of US & Canada (APT US&C;) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

It is situated near Dubrajpur. The village is famous for the Royal and historical palace and reputed college. Geography =Location= Hetampur is located at . History The earlier name of the place was Raghabpur, named after Raghab Roy, who was a Zamindar of the place under the Royal Kings of Rajnagar. Murshid Quli Khan, Nawab of Bengal, came, on the request of the Rajnagar kings, to tame the rebellious Raghab Roy. The latter was defeated and he fled. Thereafter, Hatem Khan became Zamindar, of this place and it was renamed Hatempur. With the passage of time it became Hetampur.Mukhopadhyay Aditya, Birbhumer Mela, Paschim Banga , Birbhum Special Issue, February 2006, , pp. 203-214, Information & Cultural Department, Government of West Bengal. It is said that Hafeez Khan, a soldier, had an affair with a royal princess of Delhi. He fled from Delhi along with the princess and was provided refuge by Hatem Khan. He followed the latter as jaigirdar of Hetampur. =Hetampur Royal Family= Inside of Hetampur Raj Palace The House of Hetampur Raj rose from obscure origins to the status of the most powerful Kingdom and later Zamindari of Birbhum district.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, The Economic Life of a Bengal District: Birbhum 1770 - 1857, pp. 95 - 101, The University of Burdwan, 1984. Muralidhar Chakraborty, an ancestor of the Hetampur Raj family, emigrated from Bankura district to Birbhum in the late seventeenth century. He first worked in a menial job under the Muslim Zamindar of Rajnagar. His son, Chaitanya Charan Chakraborty, was brought to Hetampur by Hafeez Khan, the Fouzdar (Military Commandar) of Hetampur fort, some fifteen miles south-east of Rajnagar kingdom. His son, Radhanath Chakraborty, was actual founder of Hetampur Raj family. He subdued the Roy family of Hetampur, who were then Gomasta (Secretary) and Ijaradar (Lease Holder) of Birbhum Raj. Between 1781 and 1799 he undertook Lease of 19 Mouzas of Birbhum Raj and captured some in battles with them. He purchased several Mahals (Zamindari Area) from Murshidabad Nawab when they were put up for auction but never paid taxes and declared freedom from Muslim rule. During the period he had a decisive war with Rajnagar and became independent Bengali King of Birbhum and nearby areas. In the end, he brought the Roy family on his pay roll. When he died in 1838, the net income from his property was Rs. 20,0000. Raja Bipracharan, son of Radhanath was the most successful ruler. Within seven years of his father‚Äôs death, he made his Kingdom, the largest in Birbhum. He lent Rs. 50,000 to Bibi Rajibunissa of Rajnagar Raj family and in return secured more lands. He also ruled over extensive areas in Santhal Parganas. In 1875, Northbrook conferred on Ramranjan Chakraborty, grandson of Bipracharan, the title of Raja in British India. Two years later he was raised to the position of Raja Bahadur by Lord Lytton. In 1912, he was elevated to the rank of Maharaja. Demographics As of the 2011 Census, Hetampur had a population of 2,388; 1,188 males and 1,200 females, giving a ratio of 1010 compared to the West Bengal state average of 950. There were 282 children aged 0‚Äì6 and a child sex ratio of 1104, compared to the West Bengal state average of 956. Hetampur village had a literacy rate of 76.21%, compared to 76.26% of West Bengal- male literacy was 84.82% and female was 67.59% Education At Hetampur Krishna Chandra College, popularly known as Hetampur Mahavidyalaya is one of the reputed and oldest college of the West Bengal. There are also few schools and training institutes such as Hetampur Raj High School, Hetampur Girls‚Äô High School, St. Andrus, Hetampur Model School, DAV Public School, Rabindra Najrul Smrit B. Ed College, Hetampur Rajbati Primary Teachers Training Institute etc. Culture =Rajbari= The Rajbari was built in the shape of a castle with 999 doors which has given it the name Hetampur HajarDuari. (hajar is one thousand in Bengali, duari means doored). Hetampur Rajbari has been used by film directors such as Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Tarun Majumdar, Raja Sen, Dilip Roy, Sandip Ray, and others in many Bengali films - Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, Abhijan, Mrigaya, and Ganadebata. =Temples= Hetampur has many interesting terracotta temples in various styles of architecture. During the late 1940s till about 1952 Indian artist Mukul Dey conducted detailed photographic survey of Birbhum-Barddhaman group of terracotta temples. He visited Hetampur and photo recorded the Gol-Mandir, the Chandranath Shiva temple and the Dewanji temples here. Chandranatha Siva Mandir in Hetampur of Dubrajpur, Birbhum built in 1847 is Octagonal pinnacled - Naba Ratna type with terracotta on three sides. Dewanji Mandir nearby is tightly ridged Rekha type with small terracotta facade of 19th century Birbhum-Barddhaman style having rich terracotta on two sides. Out of these three temples, the Gol-Mandir temple is no longer in existence at Hetampur. Its memory survives only in the photographs by Mukul Dey.

It is essentially a port of the Nintendo 64 game Top Gear Rally, with extra features such as more cars and tracks and a multiplayer mode that supports up to eight players. Gameplay Boss Rally is a racing game that comprises four gameplay modes: Championship, Time Attack, Quick Race, and a multiplayer mode. In Championship, a single player must progress through a series of seasons, with each season requiring the player to race against computer-controller opponents on multiple tracks. Points are awarded based on the position the player finishes a race, and if the required quantity is not met, the player will not qualify for the next season. As the player progresses through the Championship mode, new cars and tracks are unlocked. The game features a total of six tracks and 16 cars. Time Attack and Quick Race are single-race challenges where the player must race against their best time and a computer-controlled opponent, respectively. The multiplayer mode supports LAN or null modem options. LAN allows up to eight players to compete against one another, while the null modem option is limited to two players only. Development and release Boss Rally was developed by Boss Game Studios as a Microsoft Windows port of their Nintendo 64 game Top Gear Rally. Because Kemco owns the Top Gear license and Boss owns the game design, the game's title had to be changed. The game was not meant to compete with more elaborate racing games of the computer market, with the only technical improvement over its Nintendo 64 counterpart being a higher resolution. Boss Rally also features three more cars and an additional track. The soundtrack features music by a band named Dragline. The game was published by SouthPeak Interactive and first released in North America in April 1999. In the UK, Boss Rally was released in late July 1999. Reception Boss Rally received unfavorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. PC Zone described the game as generic, stating that it does not offer anything new when compared to Colin McRae Rally, while GameSpot criticized the \\"nonexistent\\" artificial intelligence of computer-controlled opponents and the absence of internet support.

Early life He was born on 12 November 1862 in his grandfather's (Teodor Goldi»ô) house in the village of Mocirla. His parents were Isaia and Floarea Goldi»ô. The family of his father had its origins in the Chi≈ücƒÉu village, Bihor County. Around 1740 Teodor Goldi»ô moved with his family to Mocirla where Vasile Goldi»ô was born. Bust of Vasile Goldi»ô in Alba Iulia The first years of his life were spent in the villages of Mocirla, Seleu»ô and Cermei in the house of his parents and grandparents. He started primary school in the village of Cermei in 1869 where he studied the first two grades in Romanian with his teacher Nicolae Albu. He studied the third grade at the general school in Padanul Nou (now Horea, Arad County). Between 1873 - 1881, he was a student of the Theoretical High School in Arad, being especially interested in history, literature and philosophy. On 1 September 1881, he joined the classes of the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in Arad as a scholar of the Orthodox Church, in 1881‚Äì1882 and 1884‚Äì1885 he was a student of the University of Budapest and between 1882‚Äì1884 he studied at the University of Vienna where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree. During his student years, he became a member of the Petru Maior and Romania JunƒÉ societies. After graduating, he became a professor at the E√∂tv√∂s High School in Budapest on 1 September 1885. One year later he quit this job for patriotic reasons and moved to Caransebe≈ü, where he taught History and Latin at the Pedagogic-Theological Institute. Being eager to affirm himself in the struggle of the intellectual Romanians for more political rights in Austria-Hungary, on 5 March 1888 he sent a letter to Gheorghe Bari»õiu, asking for a teacher job in Sibiu. A year later, on 1 September 1889, he was appointed professor in Bra≈üov, where he remained until 1901. He wrote many books on Latin, History and Constitutional Law for his students. In 1890 he became a member and then secretary of the Romanian House in Bra≈üov. Political activity =Before the war= In 1893 he became a member of the Romanian National Party and collaborator of the Tribuna newspaper in Sibiu. Between 1895 - 1901 he acted as secretary at the Society for the Creation of the Romanian Theater which sponsored young Romanian actors from Transylvania. Since 1905 Vasile Goldi»ô devoted himself to the political activity. On 10 January 1905 at the Romanian National Party (RNP) convention he demanded that passive resistance towards the governments in Budapest and Vienna be put aside and asked for a new active and dynamic tactic in the struggle for more political rights of the Romanians in Austria-Hungary. This tactic, known as the \\"new activism\\", was not immediately adopted by the party but all the leaders were consonant with the idea. He wrote together with Emanoil Ungureanu and Ioan Mihu a memorandum on behalf of the RNP to the Hungarian government on 13 September 1910. The memo stated the following requests: the legal recognition on the National Romanian Party, the implementation of the universal vote and the repeal of the Apponyi educational law. All these requests were rejected, the RNP was dissolved and merged with other parties in Hungary. The differences in opinions in the National Party concerning the talks with the Hungarian government sparked between 1910 and 1911 dissidences within the party. As a result, two separate wings formed: the radical wing, represented by the young members of the party, grouped around the Tribuna newspaper (Octavian Goga, Ilarie Chendi, Onisifor Ghibu, Vasile Bocu) and the moderate wing, represented by the older members of the party. At first Vasile Goldi»ô joined the moderates, but after he had realized that this conflict would have irreparable consequences on the activity of the party, he suggested (together with Aurel LazƒÉr, Ioan Suciu, Vasile Lucaciu and »òtefan Cicio-Pop) a compromise in order to preserve the political unity of the Romanians in Transylvania. Under these circumstances, in January 1911 he was appointed head of the Rom√¢nul newspaper, published at Arad. Rom√¢nul would become the voice of the Romanian political struggle after the close-down of the Tribuna newspaper in March 1912. =During the war= During the First World War, he refused to sign the loyalty declaration towards Hungary as requested by the Tisza government. This act, qualified by the Hungarian authorities as \\"duplicity and lack of patriotism\\", determined the suspension of the Rom√¢nul newspaper in March 1916. During the war, Vasile Goldi»ô continued to fight the official policy of Magyarization. He protested against the internment in concentration camps of some ethnic Romanians suspected of treason by the Hungarian government.

Vasile Goldi»ô lived his last years in Arad in modest conditions. He died on 10 February 1934.

The church became racially integrated in the 1790s when slaves fleeing a revolution in Santo Domingo settled in Philadelphia and some joined the church.

Trained as a quantum mathematician, she changed her field of interest to bees, and spent decades researching bees, traveling to more than 60 countries, often under primitive conditions.  Life and career  Born as Ethel Eva Widdowson in London she earned a Ph.D in 1941 in nuclear physics. She became a lecturer in Physics at Sheffield University. She married James Crane, a stockbroker serving in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, in 1942. Her interest in bees began when she and her husband received a beehive as a wedding present; the giver had hoped that it would help supplement their wartime sugar ration. Crane wrote over 180 papers, articles, and books, many when she was in her 70s and 80s. Honey: A Comprehensive Survey (1975), in which she contributed several important chapters, and edited, came about because she told the publisher (Heinemann Press) that a book on the subject was sorely needed. Although now out of print, it remains the most significant review on the subject ever written. A Book of Honey (1980) and The Archaeology of Beekeeping (1983) reflected her strong interests in nutrition and the ancient past of beekeeping. Her two lengthy books, Bees and Beekeeping: science, practice and world resources (1990; 614 pages) and The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting (1999; 682 pages) are regarded as seminal in the beekeeping world. Along with writing many books and articles, Crane also helped create a beekeeping library, which held many books on bees and beekeeping, and turned the small journal Bee World, founded in 1919 by Ahmad Zaki Abu Shadi, into a well-known scientific magazine.\\"Crane, Eva.\\" Current Biography Yearbook 1993.

The remaining Norman work is confined to the buttresses and some chip-carved string at the west end of the church. The south porch is gabled, and the shallow north porch from the 17th century masks a 13th-century moulding on the north door, which is framed by yew trees. The north aisle features three late tracery windows and one small 13th century lancet, and the south aisle features 14th century tracery. The chancel includes tall 14th century windows which have been restored, and a flowing east window designed by Pearson. The west window is from the 14th century and reticulated with an ogee arch which ends in a canopied niche. The north transept is probably 13th century and features two lancets flanking the 15th century east window. Tudor windows line the north transept and lie on the west side of the aisles. Square-headed clerestory windows feature a stilted drip moulding. In the interior of the church, the arcades date principally from the 13th century and incorporate older 12th century structure, but the work is not uniform. The north transept is divided from the north aisle by a double arcade. The chancel features a 14th-century truss-rafter roof, and a decorated piscina and part of a sedilia retaining traces of color are fitted under the first south window, which is lowered to accommodate them. The chancel arch is of plain half-round structure with no springing. The organ is blocked, and a chamber arch and two medieval tile settings have been excavated at west end. The nave roof is 19th century, but one of the 15th century corbel beams bears the arms of John Weston, who served as rector from 1416‚Äì38. The font is in goblet style from the late 16th century, and the stained glass was provided by Wailes and Strang, a 19th- century firm notable for English church window designs. The church features a four-stage tower from the 15th century, with corner buttresses to the second stages, two-light supermullioned bell openings, battlements adorned with blank arches, and crocketed corner pinnacles. A projecting rectangular turret on the southwest side houses the stair. The parapet includes pinnacles and a string course with gargoyles. The tower was completed in 1447, is 88 feet (26.8 metres) high and houses the heaviest ring of bells, eight in all, in Gloucestershire. A clock with chimes has existed there since 1580, and the present clock was built in 1926. The painting of the Crucifixion in the south aisle was painted by Gaspar de Craeyer (1582‚Äì1669), a contemporary of Reubens and Van Dyck. Many notable features of the Cotswold church can be attributed to the town's prosperity as a trade centre. The church is in the highest category of architectural/historic listing (Grade I), having been assessed under the standards set by the statutorily responsible charity, English Heritage, which compiles the heritage list for England. A tourist attraction, it is among 98 Grade I listed buildings in Cotswold (district), a mainly rural district having about one third of those in Gloucestershire, having many conservation areas and neatly cut Cotswold stone which is the main building material of this structure. =Ministry= The ministry of the benefice of Stow, Condicote and the Swells (the SCATS benefice) under the Reverend Short is broad church and it encourages believers to be beyond parochial, fulfilling the Anglican Five-Mark Mission which requires the worldliness and mindfulness to History =Building and restorations= The Church of St Edward is an ashlar Cotswold stone Norman church, its parts dating from the 11th or 12th to the 14th century except for its tower and clerestory of the 15th century. It stands on the site of the original Saxon church, believed to have been made of wood. The tower and clerestory required substantial funds, provided by the community's wool trade which directly enriched the medieval rectory. The church was also renovated in the 17th century and in 1873.Stow on the Wold J M Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer Entry, 1870-72 The then parish priest, Reverend Robert William Hippisley, commissioned architect John Loughborough Pearson. Hippisley served long and had a substantial parish income as Rector during his 1844-99 ministry. He conserved the building avoiding blunt Victorian restoration. He attracted complaints in the running of the final civic (secular) vestry: . =Rectory house= Stow Lodge, now non-religious was said in 1900 to be Hippisley's property, built, in the 18th century, for the Chamberlayne family whose crest it bears and was used as the parsonage for a large part of the 19th century. The original parsonage, which was under repair in 1840 has been lost; with a plausible reference north-east of the town centre 'Parson's Corner'. The rectory was built in the early 20th century, away from the town at the southern end of the graveyard. =Role in Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold= In 1646 during the English Civil War, the Royalist army marched through the Cotswolds, attempting to join the forces of King Charles I at Oxford. However, they were met by a Parliamentary force in the battle, and the encounter was so deadly that it was said ducks could bathe in the pools of blood left in the street near the market square. Reportedly the street was afterward called \\"Digbeth\\" or \\"Duck's Bath\\" because of this. After the last battle in the war was fought at nearby Donnington, Gloucestershire, the church housed 1,000 prisoners following the defeat of the Royalists. The church features memorials to Francis Keyt and John Chamberlayne who died in 1646 during the Battle of Stow, and also houses memorials to those who died in service during World War I and World War II. =In contemporary film, fiction or media= The funeral of the Who's bass player, John Entwistle, took place at the church in 2002. Entwistle lived at Quarwood, a country estate in the civil (and ecclesiastical) parishes of Stow. Many mourners attended the private church service conducted by family friend Colin Wilson. The service was broadcast through a PA system to fans who had gathered outside. =Wealth and contribution= Medieval period Elrington, a prominent historian selected to compile the lengthy Victoria County History work found sources such as quoting the town's name as Edwardstow(e) from at least Domesday. Churches were dedicated to the Holy Family or Saints, so if the town was named after its church as well as an individual, the likely root of the name he believed was Edward the Martyr. A Latin charter pre-dating the other main contender for the dedication, bearing the date 986, he added, seems to be a medieval fake. He draws attention to the other lightly evidenced roots: saint 'Edwold' √Üthelwold of Winchester and the late 12th century-canonised immediately pre-1066 King, Edward the Confessor being the dedication, the latter being taken as true in local 15th century worship.'Parishes: Stow-on- the-Wold' A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 6, ed. C R Elrington (London, 1965), pp. 142-165 Accessed 21 April 2015. Maugersbury or Donnington in the parish formed wealthy manors. The only glebe in Donnington in 1765, Chapel Yard, may record a failed intention to build a chapel of ease there. Evesham Abbey's rights in this church's donations, tithes and lands were an issue in disputes between the abbey and the bishop and in 1208 it was proposed to resolve the difficulties by appropriating the church. By then the abbey possessed two-thirds of the great tithes of Donnington and perhaps also of Maugersbury. In 1291 the Abbey also received a pension of ¬£1 5s. 0d. from the church. The Abbey's attempts to appropriate subsided and the living (benefice) stayed as a rectory. Lands and contributions to the church In the 16th century the rectory let as a farm produced nearly ¬£18 a year clear. By 1650 it was worth c. ¬£150 (a year) and remained about the same until inclosure (privatisation of common land) in 1765 and 1766 when in return for loss of its imputed interests the rectory (rector's successive estate) received glebe of of that land. The annual value of the benefice rose to over ¬£500 a year in 1864, , since which it has in real terms waned due to economic changes and a loss of public functions' supervision, such as to Cotswold District council and central government. Three chantries in the town, one including a hospital, one formerly known as a guild that was reputedly pre-Conquest ended on Henry VIII's Chantries Acts; various educational and civic improvements and products of funding from the church are shown in medieval National Archives and Lambeth Palace records. Rectors, curates and church hall Rowland Wylde, parish priest of Stow and Lower Swell from 1642, was deprived before 1649 as a delinquent and restored (as with the monarchy, the year before) in 1661, this post having been served meanwhile by \\"an active controversialist of Congregational (parish independence) tendencies\\". Benjamin Callow followed Wylde in Stow and Lower Swell, ministering them for 40 years. He spent most of his time in Stow and faced disciplinary action for neglecting Lower Swell. Four rectors spanned the whole period from 1744 to 1899, and three of them were members of the Hippisley family; all of them maintained (paid for) curates but towards the end of the service from 1844-1899 of Robert William Hippisley, with whom many wealthy inhabitants quarrelled, a Stow Curate was appointed and paid by a committee independent of him. That curate was J. T. Evans who was rector from 1899 to 1935 and author of the standard work on the church plate of Gloucestershire. In 1937 the first church hall was built by the Foss Way in the superseded parish of Lower Swell. =Local roles before the enlargement of state funded institutions= In 1566 Stow had four churchwardens in all to help cover Maugersbury and Donnington, as in 1826. By the early 19th century one of the wardens for the town was the rector's nominee (choice). The office of parish clerk and sexton, prized, was filled by election by the parishioners. Two overseers and two surveyors who presented separate accounts operated and were made responsible in 1825 for repairing the town well. In 1834 a small majority defeated a proposal to appoint a paid assistant overseer. Two conditional contributions in 1691 and 1710 towards building a workhouse were returned because no workhouse was built. In 1712 Quarter Sessions (county judicial/administrative matters) ordered that a combined workhouse and house of correction should be established at Stow in the 'Eagle and Child'. Expenditure on poor relief in the late 18th century increased more than the average for the area, and remained high. A school of industry with 22 children, recorded in one record of 1802 was not in that of 1812. To deal with health problems, the vestry in the 18th century kept a pest house, (fn. 523) and in 1831 and 1833, following outbreaks of smallpox, temporary boards of health were set up. (fn. 524) A burial board was formed in 1855, and a new graveyard was opened south of the town beside the Foss Way. A nuisance removal committee existed in 1859 when a nuisance inspector was appointed. The town and the two hamlets all became part of the Stow-on-the- Wold Poor Law Union under the Poor Laws-related act of 1834, and of the Stow- on-the-Wold highway district in 1863. Under 1872 legislation the town and the urban part of Maugersbury (transferred to Stow civil parish in 1894) were placed under a local board and subsequently became an urban district. Donnington and the rest of Maugersbury became part of the Stow-on-the-Wold Rural Sanitary District under the Act of 1872, and were transferred in 1935 to the newly formed North Cotswold Rural District, in which the Stow urban district was merged the same year and from that year a civil parish council governed the remaining civil aspects beneath the district level of government. Numerous church-overseen testamentary charities served, many of which were sufficient provision for the weak and infirm housed in the row of almshouses. Funds were more manageably administered into an annual revenue-focussed joint board Scheme from 1899. In 1961 the almshouses were condemned as unfit for habitation but five were occupied and stipends continued to be distributed to the almspeople. The other charities for the poor were distributed in kind, such as the rent from a fuel allotment (coppices) being spent on coal.

The Israeli and U.S. governments did not announce the secret raids for seven months.Leonard S. Spector and Avner Cohen, Israel's Airstrike on Syria's Reactor: Implications for the Nonproliferation Regime, Arms Control Today, Vol. 38, No. 6 (July/August 2008), pp. 15‚Äì21, Arms Control Association The White House and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) subsequently confirmed that American intelligence had also indicated the site was a nuclear facility with a military purpose, though Syria denies this. A 2009 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigation reported evidence of uranium and graphite and concluded that the site bore features resembling an undeclared nuclear reactor. IAEA was initially unable to confirm or deny the nature of the site because, according to IAEA, Syria failed to provide necessary cooperation with the IAEA investigation. Syria has disputed these claims. Nearly four years later, in April 2011 during the Syrian Civil War, the IAEA officially confirmed that the site was a nuclear reactor. Israel did not acknowledge the attack until 2018. The attack reportedly followed Israeli top-level consultations with the Bush Administration. After realizing that the US was not willing to bomb the site after being told so by U.S. President George W. Bush, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert decided to adhere to the 1981 Begin Doctrine and unilaterally strike to prevent a Syrian nuclear weapons capability, despite serious concerns about Syrian retaliation. In stark contrast to the doctrine's prior usage against Iraq, the airstrike against Syria did not elicit international outcry. A main reason is that Israel maintained total and complete silence regarding the attack, and Syria covered up its activities at the site and did not cooperate fully with the IAEA. The international silence may have been a tacit recognition of the inevitability of preemptive attacks on \\"clandestine nuclear programs in their early stages.\\" If true, the Begin Doctrine has undoubtedly played a role in shaping this global perception.Country Profiles‚ÄîIsrael , Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), updated May 2014 According to official government confirmation on 21 March 2018, the raid was carried out by Israeli Air Force (IAF) 69 Squadron F-15Is, and 119 Squadron and 253 Squadron F-16Is, and an ELINT aircraft; as many as eight aircraft participated and at least four of these crossed into Syrian airspace.Hersh, Seymour. \\"A Strike in the Dark\\", The New Yorker, 11 February 2008.

Fulghum and Robert Wall, Aviation Week & Space Technology as IAF electronic warfare (EW) systems took over Syria's air defense systems, feeding them a false sky-picture for the entire period of time that the Israeli fighter jets needed to cross Syria, bomb their target and return. By YAAKOV KATZ, 29 September 2010, Jerusalem Post On 6 March 2017, the Kibar nuclear site was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces ‚Äì a U.S.-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab militia fighters ‚Äì from a retreating ISIL force in northern Deir Ezzor province. Pre-strike activity In 2001, the Mossad, Israel's external intelligence service, was profiling newly inducted Syrian President Bashar al- Assad. Visits by North Korean dignitaries, which focused on advanced arms deliveries, were noticed. Aman, Israel's military intelligence department, suggested nuclear arms were being discussed, but the Mossad dismissed this theory. In spring 2004, U.S. intelligence reported multiple communications between Syria and North Korea, and traced the calls to a desert location called al-Kibar. Unit 8200, Israel's signals intelligence and codebreaking unit, added the location to its watch list. The Daily Telegraph, citing anonymous sources, reported that in December 2006, a top Syrian official (according to one article this was the head of the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, Ibrahim Othman) arrived in London under a false name. The Mossad had detected a booking for the official in a London hotel, and dispatched at least ten undercover agents to London. The agents were split into three teams. One group was sent to Heathrow Airport to identify the official as he arrived, a second to book into his hotel, and a third to monitor his movements and visitors. Some of the operatives were from the Kidon Division, which specializes in assassinations, and the Neviot Division, which specializes in breaking into homes, embassies, and hotel rooms to install bugging devices. On the first day of his visit, he visited the Syrian embassy and then went shopping. Kidon operatives closely followed him, while Neviot operatives broke into his hotel room and found his laptop. A computer expert then installed software that allowed the Mossad to monitor his activities on the computer. When the computer material was examined at Mossad headquarters, officials found blueprints and hundreds of pictures of the Kibar facility in various stages of construction, and correspondence. One photograph showed North Korean nuclear official Chon Chibu meeting with Ibrahim Othman, Syria's atomic energy agency director. Though the Mossad had originally planned to kill the official in London, it was decided to spare his life following the discovery. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was notified. The following month, Olmert formed a three-member panel to report on Syria's nuclear program. The CIA was also informed and the American intelligence network joined the quest for more information. Six months later, Brigadier-General Yaakov Amidror, one of the panel's members, informed Olmert that Syria was working with North Korea and Iran on a nuclear facility. Iran had funneled $1 billion to the project, and planned on using the Kibar facility to replace Iranian facilities if Iran was unable to complete its uranium enrichment program. In July 2007, an explosion occurred in Musalmiya, northern Syria. The official Sana news agency said 15 Syrian military personnel were killed and 50 people were injured. The agency reported only that \\"very explosive products\\" blew up after a fire broke out at the facility. The edition of 26 September of Jane's Defence Weekly claimed that the explosion happened during tests to weaponise a Scud-C missile with mustard gas. A senior U.S. official told ABC News that, in early summer 2007, Israel had discovered a suspected Syrian nuclear facility, and that the Mossad then \\"managed to either co-opt one of the facility's workers or to insert a spy posing as an employee\\" at the suspected Syrian nuclear site, and through this was able to get pictures of the target from on the ground.\\" In mid August 2007, Israeli commandos from the Sayeret Matkal reconnaissance unit covertly raided the suspected Syrian nuclear facility and brought nuclear material back to Israel. Two helicopters ferried twelve commandos to the site in order to get photographic evidence and soil samples. The commandos were probably dressed in Syrian uniforms. Although the mission was successful, it had to be aborted earlier than planned after the Israelis were spotted by Syrian soldiers. Soil analysis revealed traces of nuclear activity. There was disagreement between CIA director Michael Hayden and Mossad director Meir Dagan about whether the site should be bombed. Hayden was fearful that this would cause an all-out war, but Dagan was sure that Assad would not react, so long as the bombing was done covertly and not publicized. Anonymous sources reported that once material was tested and confirmed to have come from North Korea, the United States approved an Israeli attack on the site. Senior U.S. officials later claimed that they were not involved in or approved the attack, but were informed in advance. In his memoir Decision Points, President George W. Bush wrote that Prime Minister Olmert requested that the U.S. bomb the Syrian site, but Bush refused, saying the intelligence was not definitive on whether the plant was part of a nuclear weapons program. Bush claimed that Olmert did not ask for a green light for an attack and that he did not give one, but that Olmert acted alone and did what he thought was necessary to protect Israel.George W. Bush, Decision Points, London: Random House, 2010, p. 421‚Äì422 Another report indicated that Israel planned to attack the site as early as 14 July, but some U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, preferred a public condemnation of Syria, thereby delaying the military strike until Israel feared the information would leak to the press. The Sunday Times also reported that the mission was \\"personally directed\\" by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Three days before the attack, a North Korean cargo ship carrying materials labeled as cement docked in the Syrian port of Tartus. An Israeli online data analyst, Ronen Solomon, found an internet trace for the 1,700-tonne cargo ship, the Al Hamed, which allegedly was docked at Tartus on 3 September. By 25 April 2008 the ship was under the flag of the Comoros.e-ships.net database, Retrieved 24 April 2008 Several newspapers reported that Iranian general Ali Reza Asgari, who had disappeared in February in a possible defection to the West, supplied Western intelligence with information about the site. Target Alleged Syrian nuclear reactor, after it was destroyed by Israeli air strike CNN first reported that the airstrike targeted weapons \\"destined for Hezbollah militants\\" and that the strike \\"left a big hole in the desert\\". One week later, The Washington Post reported that U.S. and Israeli intelligence gathered information on a nuclear facility constructed in Syria with North Korean aid, and that the target was a \\"facility capable of making unconventional weapons\\". According to The Sunday Times, there were claims of a cache of nuclear materials from North Korea. Syrian Vice-President Faruq Al Shara announced on 30 September that the Israeli target was the Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Lands, but the center itself immediately denied this. The following day Syrian President Bashar al-Assad described the bombing target as an \\"incomplete and empty military complex that was still under construction\\". He did not provide any further details about the nature of the structure or its purpose. On 14 October The New York Times cited U.S. and Israeli military intelligence sources saying that the target had been a nuclear reactor under construction by North Korean technicians, with a number of the technicians having been killed in the strike. On 2 December The Sunday Times quoted Uzi Even, a professor at Tel Aviv University and a founder of the Negev Nuclear Research Center, saying that he believes that the Syrian site was built to process plutonium and assemble a nuclear bomb, using weapons- grade plutonium originally from North Korea. He also said that Syria's quick burial of the target site with tons of soil was a reaction to fears of radiation. On 19 March 2009, Hans R√ºhle, former chief of the planning staff of the German Defense Ministry, wrote in the Swiss daily Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung that Iran was financing a Syrian nuclear reactor. R√ºhle did not identify the sources of his information. He wrote that U.S. intelligence had detected North Korean ship deliveries of construction supplies to Syria that started in 2002, and that the construction was spotted by American satellites in 2003, who detected nothing unusual, partly because the Syrians had banned radio and telephones from the site and handled communications solely by messengers. He said that \\"The analysis was conclusive that it was a North Korean-type reactor, a gas graphite model\\" and that \\"Israel estimates that Iran had paid North Korea between $1 billion and $2 billion for the project\\". He also wrote that just before the Israeli operation, a North Korean ship was intercepted en route to Syria with nuclear fuel rods. The Operation Ten Israeli F-15I Ra'am fighter jets (including aircraft '209') from the Israeli Air Force 69th Squadron armed with laser-guided bombs, escorted by F-16I Sufa fighter jets ‚Äì including aircraft '432' from 253rd squadron and '459' from 119th squadron‚Äì and a few ELINT aircraft, took off from Ramat David Airbase. Three of the F-15s were ordered back to base, while the remaining seven continued towards Syria. The Israelis destroyed a Syrian radar site in Tall al-Abuad with conventional precision bombs, electronic attack, and jamming. =Electronic warfare= The IAF's Special Electronic Missions Aircraft, which reportedly took part in the operation Israel reportedly used electronic warfare to take over Syrian air-defenses and feed them a false-sky picture, for the entire period of time that the Israeli fighter jets needed to cross Syria, bomb their target and return. This technology which neutralized Syrian radars may be similar to the Suter airborne network attack system. This would make it possible to feed enemy radar emitters with false targets, and even directly manipulate enemy sensors. In May 2008, a report in IEEE Spectrum cited European sources claiming that the Syrian air defense network had been deactivated by a secret built-in kill switch activated by the Israelis.Sally Adee, \\"The Hunt for the Kill Switch\\", IEEE Spectrum, May 2008. When the aircraft approached the site, the Shaldag commandos directed their targeting laser at the facility, and the F-15Is released their bombs. The facility was totally destroyed. infolivetivenglish, 17 September 2007 The Shaldag commandos were extracted, and all Israeli aircraft returned to base. On their way back to Israel, the aircraft flew over Turkey and jettisoned fuel tanks over the Hatay and Gaziantep provinces. Immediately following the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, explained the situation, and asked him to relay a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that Israel would not tolerate another nuclear plant, but that no further action was planned. Olmert said that Israel did not want to play up the incident and was still interested in peace with Syria, adding that if Assad chose not to draw attention to the incident, he would do likewise. Israeli official statements Israeli 69 Squadron F-15I The first report about the raid came from CNN. Israel initially did not comment on the incident, although Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert did say that \\"The security services and Israeli defence forces are demonstrating unusual courage. We naturally cannot always show the public our cards.\\" Israeli papers were banned from doing their own reporting on the airstrike. On 16 September, the head of Israeli military intelligence, Amos Yadlin, told a parliamentary committee that Israel regained its \\"deterrent capability\\". The first public acknowledgment by an Israeli official came on 19 September, when opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu said that he had backed the operation and congratulated Prime Minister Olmert. Netanyahu advisor Uzi Arad later told Newsweek \\"I do know what happened, and when it comes out it will stun everyone.\\" On 17 September, Prime Minister Olmert announced that he was ready to make peace with Syria \\"without preset conditions and without ultimatums\\". According to a poll done by the Dahaf Research Institute, Olmert's approval rating rose from 25% to 35% after the airstrike. On 2 October 2007, the IDF confirmed the attack took place, following a request by Haaretz to lift censorship; however, the IDF continued to censor details of the actual strike force and its target. On 28 October, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the Israeli cabinet that he had apologized to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan if Israel violated Turkish airspace. In a statement released to the press after the meeting he said: \\"In my conversation with the Turkish prime minister, I told him that if Israeli planes indeed penetrated Turkish airspace, then there was no intention thereby, either in advance or in any case, to‚Äîin any way‚Äîviolate or undermine Turkish sovereignty, which we respect.\\" Syrian reaction Abu Mohammed, a former major in the Syrian air force, recounted in 2013 that air defenses in the Deir ez-Zor region were told to stand down as soon as the Israeli planes were detected heading to the reactor. According to a WikiLeaks cable, the Syrian government placed long- range missiles armed with chemical warheads on high alert after the attack but did not retaliate, fearing an Israeli nuclear counterstrike. Syria at first claimed that its anti-aircraft weapons had fired at Israeli planes, which bombed empty areas in the desert, or later, a military construction site.\\" During the two days following the attack, Turkish media reported finding Israeli fuel tanks in Hatay and Gaziantep Province, and the Turkish Foreign Minister lodged a formal protest with the Israeli envoy. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, Syria called the incursion a \\"breach of airspace of the Syrian Arab Republic\\" and said \\"it is not the first time Israel has violated\\" Syrian airspace. Syria also accused the international community of ignoring Israeli actions. A UN spokesperson said Syria had not requested a meeting of the UN Security Council and France, at the time the president of the Security Council, said it had received no letter from Syria. On 27 April 2008, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, making his first public comments about the raid, dismissed the allegations that it was a nuclear site which was attacked as false: \\"Is it logical? A nuclear site did not have protection with surface to air defenses? A nuclear site within the footprint of satellites in the middle of Syria in an open area in the desert?\\" Independent experts, however, suggested that Syria did not fortify its suspected reactor in order to avoid drawing attention and because the building was not yet operational. Besides a nuclear program, Syria is believed to have extensive arsenals, as well as biological and chemical warheads for its long-range missiles.Breaking News ‚Äì JTA, Jewish & Israel News On 25 February 2009, IAEA officials reported that Ibrahim Othman, Syria's nuclear chief, told a closed IAEA technical meeting that Syria built a missile facility on the site. International reactions No Arab government besides Syria has formally commented on 6 September incident. The Egyptian weekly Al- Ahram commented on the \\"synchronized silence of the Arab world.\\" Neither the Israeli nor Syrian government has offered a detailed description of what occurred. Outside experts and media commentators have filled the data vacuum by offering their own diverse interpretations about what precisely happened that night. Western commentators took the position that the lack of official non-Syrian Arab condemnations of Israel's action, threats of retaliation against Israel, or even professions of support for the Syrian government or people must imply that their governments tacitly supported the Israeli action. Even Iranian officials have not formally commented on the Israeli attack or Syria's reactions.Weitz, Richard. \\"Israeli Airstrike in Syria: International Reactions \\", James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) at the Monterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS), 1 November 2007. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was asked if North Korea was helping Syria in the nuclear realm, but replied only that \\"we are watching the North Koreans very carefully. We watch the Syrians very carefully.\\" The North Korean government strongly condemned Israel's actions: \\"This is a very dangerous provocation little short of wantonly violating the sovereignty of Syria and seriously harassing the regional peace and security.\\" On 17 October, in reaction to the UN press office's release of a First Committee, Disarmament and International Security meeting's minutes that paraphrased an unnamed Syrian representative as saying that a nuclear facility was hit by the raid, Syria denied the statement, adding that \\"such facilities do not exist in Syria.\\" However state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said that media reports had misquoted the Syrian diplomat.\\" On the same day, the IAEA's Mohamed ElBaradei criticized the raid, saying that \\"to bomb first and then ask questions later [...] undermines the system and it doesn't lead to any solution to any suspicion.\\"\\" The IAEA had been observing the disabling of the DPRK Yongbyon nuclear facilities since July 2007, and was responsible for the containment and surveillance of the fuel rods and other nuclear materials from there. U.S. House Resolution 674, introduced on 24 September 2007, expressed \\"unequivocal support ... for Israel's right to self defense in the face of an imminent nuclear or military threat from Syria.\\" The bill had 15 cosponsors, but never reached a vote.\\"Bill H. Res. 674: Expressing the unequivocal support of the House of Representatives for Israel's right to self...\\", U.S. House of Representatives, bill introduced 24 September 2007. On 26 October,The New York Times published satellite photographs showing that the Syrians had almost entirely removed all remains of the facility. U.S. intelligence sources noted that such an operation would usually take up to a year to complete and expressed astonishment at the speed with which it was carried out. Former weapons inspector David Albright believed that the work was meant to hide evidence of wrongdoing. On 28 April 2008, CIA Director Michael Hayden said that a suspected Syrian reactor bombed by Israel had the capacity to produce \\"enough plutonium for one or two weapons per year\\", and that it was of a \\"similar size and technology\\" to North Korea's Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. In his memoir Decision Points, President George W. Bush claimed that the strike confirmed that Syria had been pursuing a nuclear- weapons program and that \\"intelligence is not an exact science\\", relating that while he had been told that U.S. analysts only had low confidence that the facility was part of a nuclear-weapons program, surveillance after the airstrike showed parts of the destroyed facility being covered up. Bush wrote that \\"if the facility was really just an innocent research lab, Syrian President Assad would have been screaming at the Israelis on the floor of the United Nations\\". He also wrote that in a telephone conversation with Olmert, he suggested that the operation be kept secret for a while and then made public to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that might force Syrian retaliation. In April 2011, after a lengthy investigation the IAEA officially confirmed that the site was a nuclear reactor. In 2012, the Non-aligned Movement adopted a statement according to which: 'The Heads of State or Government underscored the Movement's principled position concerning non-use or threat of use of force against the territorial integrity of any State. In this regard, they condemned the Israeli attack against a Syrian facility on 6 September 2007, which constitutes a flagrant violation of the UN Charter and welcomed Syria's cooperation with the IAEA in this regard‚Äô (NAM Final Document 2012/Doc.1/Rev.2, para 176). Release of intelligence On 10 October 2007, The New York Times reported that the Israelis had shared the Syrian strike dossier with Turkey. In turn, the Turks traveled to Damascus and confronted the Syrians with the dossier, alleging a nuclear program. Syria denied this with vigor, saying that the target was a storage depot for strategic missiles. On 25 October 2007, The New York Times reported that two commercial satellite photos taken before and after the raid showed that a square building no longer exists at the suspected site. On 27 October 2007, The New York Times reported that the imaging company Geoeye released an image of the building from 16 September 2003, and from this security analyst John Pike estimated that construction began in 2001. \\"A senior intelligence official\\" also told The New York Times that the U.S. has observed the site for years by spy satellite. Subsequent searches of satellite imagery discovered that an astronaut aboard the International Space Station had taken a picture of the area on 5 September 2002. The image, though of low resolution, is good enough to show that the building existed as of that date. A screenshot of a CIA computer model of the Syrian nuclear reactor at Al Kibar. On 11 January 2008, DigitalGlobe released a satellite photo showing that a building similar to the suspected target of the attack had been rebuilt in the same location. However, an outside expert said that it was unlikely to be a reactor and could be cover for excavation of the old site. On 1 April 2008, Asahi Shimbun reported that Ehud Olmert told Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda during a meeting on 27 February that the target of the strike was \\"nuclear-related facility that was under construction with know-how and assistance from North Korean technicians dispatched by Pyongyang.\\" On 24 April 2008, the CIA released a video and background briefing, which it claims shows similarities between the North Korean nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and the one in Syria which was bombed by Israel. According to a U.S. official, there did not appear to be any uranium at the reactor, and although it was almost completed, it could not have been declared operational without significant testing. A statement from the White House Press Secretary on 24 April 2008, followed the briefing given to some Congressional committees that week. According to the statement, the administration believed that Syria had been building a covert reactor with North Korean assistance that was capable of producing plutonium, and that the purpose was non-peaceful. It was also stated that the IAEA was being briefed with the intelligence. The IAEA confirmed receipt of the information, and planned to investigate. It was critical of not being informed earlier, and described the unilateral use of force as \\"undermining the due process of verification\\". Syrian officials, however, denied any North Korean involvement in their country. According to BBC News, Syria's ambassador to the UK, Sami Khiyami, dismissed the allegations as ridiculous. \\"We are used to such allegations now, since the day the United States has invaded Iraq ‚Äì you remember all the theatrical presentations concerning the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\\" Mr Khiyami said the facility was a deserted military building that had \\"nothing to do with a reactor\\". On 21 March 2018, Israel formally acknowledged the operation and released newly declassified materials including photographs and cockpit video of the airstrike. Initial skepticism about the US and Israeli claims Despite the release of intelligence information from the American and Israeli sources, the attack on the Syrian site was initially controversial. Some commentators had argued that at the time of the attack the site had no obvious barbed wire or air defenses that would normally ring a sensitive military facility. Mohamed ElBaradei had previously stated that Syria's ability to construct and run a complex nuclear process was doubtful‚Äîspeaking ahead of the IAEA inspection of the alleged Syrian nuclear site, which had been demolished, he said: \\"It is doubtful we will find anything there now, assuming there was anything in the first place.\\" The New York Times reported that after the publishing of US intelligence data on 24 April, \\"two senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the evidence had left them with no more than \\"low confidence\\" that Syria was preparing to build a nuclear weapon. However, while they said that there was no sign that Syria had built an operation to convert the spent fuel from the plant into weapons-grade plutonium, they had told President Bush last year that they could think of no other explanation for the reactor.\\" BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Jonathan Marcus commented on the release of the CIA video that \\"Briefings about alleged weapons of mass destruction programmes have a lot to live down in the wake of the US experience in Iraq\\". Aftermath =IAEA investigation= On 19 November 2008, IAEA released a report which said the Syrian complex bore features resembling those of an undeclared nuclear reactor and UN inspectors found \\"significant\\" traces of uranium at the site. The report said the findings gleaned from inspectors' visit to the site in June were not enough to conclude a reactor was once there. It said further investigation and greater Syrian transparency were needed. The confidential nuclear safeguards report said Syria would be asked to show to inspectors debris and equipment whisked away from the site after the September 2007 Israeli air raid. On 19 February 2009, the IAEA reported that samples taken from the site revealed new traces of processed uranium. A senior UN official said additional analysis of the June find had found 40 more uranium particles, for a total of 80 particles, and described it as significant. He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to nuclear activity. The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top agency officials. Syria disputed these claims. According to Syria's IAEA representative Othman, there would have been a large amount of graphite had the building been a nuclear reactor. Othman continued, \\"They found 80 particles in half a million tonnes of soil. I don't know how you can use that figure to accuse somebody of building such a facility.\\" In a November 2009 report, the IAEA stated that its investigation had been stymied due to Syria's failure to cooperate. The following February, under the new leadership of Yukiya Amano, the IAEA stated that \\"The presence of such [uranium] particles points to the possibility of nuclear-related activities at the site and adds to questions concerning the nature of the destroyed building. ... Syria has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for the origin and presence of these particles\\". Syria disputed these allegations, saying that there is not a military nuclear program in the country and that it has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the field of nuclear medicine. Syria's foreign minister said, \\"We are committed to the non- proliferation agreement between the agency and Syria and we (only) allow inspectors to come according to this agreement. ... We will not allow anything beyond the agreement because Syria does not have a military nuclear program. Syria is not obliged to open its other sites to inspectors.\\" Syria maintains that the natural uranium found at the site came from Israeli missiles. On 28 April 2010, the head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano declared for the first time that the target was indeed the covert site of a future nuclear reactor, countering Syrian assertions. =The site during Syrian Civil War= During the Syrian Civil War, the reactor site fell to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant group in May 2014. On 6 March 2017, the site was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces ‚Äì a U.S.-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab militia fighters. Since then, the site has remained inside the territory governed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. =Claiming responsibility= On 22 March 2018, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officially took responsibility for destroying a nuclear reactor built in the northeastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zor in 2007 after a decade of ambiguity.

His father ran a furniture shop and his mother had been an actress. He is the second youngest of six children. Walsh states that he saw his father, a salesman, as the 'lead actor' in the business, but as Ireland's economy fluctuated, so did furniture sales. Notably during the recession in the 1980s, when profits were low, Walsh says that he was earning more money managing his own newspaper round enterprise than his father was bringing home from the shop. Life in the large family was full of incident and Enda has claimed that many of his plays find their origin in his relationships with his father, his mother and her friends, his three brothers and two sisters. Enda attended the Greendale Community School where he was taught by both Roddy Doyle and Paul Mercier. After studying Communications at Rathmines College and acting for the Dublin Youth Theatre Walsh travelled in Europe working as a film editor. On his return to Dublin he found few opportunities and so moved to Cork where he acted for theatre-in-education Graffiti Theatre. In 1993 Walsh began working with Pat Kiernan, director of Corcadorca, a collaborative ensemble which devised what Walsh calls ‚Äòterrible‚Äô plays. In 1996 Disco Pigs premiered at the Triskel Art Centre in Cork. This was the start of an international career writing for the stage and screen. Feeling himself to be 'too comfortable' in Dublin, in 2005 Walsh and his wife, Jo Ellison, who is currently fashion editor of the Financial Times, moved to London. They live in Kilburn with their daughter, Ada, and their cockapoo, Alvin.  Working life  Starting with his experience at Corcadorca, Walsh has never restricted himself to straight plays but has been happy to cross genres. Originally he would write music for one member of the ensemble and opportunities for dance for others. In the list of Walsh's works, there are musicals, an opera, art installations, and radio plays, such as Four Big Days in the Life of Dessie Banks for RT√â and The Monotonous Life of Little Miss P for the BBC. Many of Walsh's plays including Disco Pigs,Enda Walsh, Disco Pigs, Nick Hern Books, London, 1997. Bedbound, Small Things, Chatroom, New Electric Ballroom,Enda Walsh, The New Electric Ballroom, Nick Hern Books, London, 2008. The Walworth Farce, Penelope and Misterman, have been translated into more than 20 languages and have had productions throughout Europe and in Australia, New Zealand and the US. The Last Hotel by Enda Walsh and Donnacha Dennehy, Edinburgh International Festival 2015 His play Ballyturk premiered in 2014, produced by Landmark Productions and Galway International Arts Festival starring Cillian Murphy, Stephen Rea and Mikel Murfi, and played in Dublin, Cork and London in the same year. In 2017, the production was revived at the Abbey Theatre and in early 2018 played at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, NY. In this revival Tadhg Murphy played 1, Mikel Murfi returned as 2 and Olwen Fouere played 3. Three members of the Gleeson family (Brendan, Domhnall and Brian) played the lead roles in The Walworth Farce produced by Landmark Productions at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin, in their first theatrical production together. He adapted Roald Dahl's book The Twits for the theatre with its first production in April‚ÄìMay 2015. An opera entitled The Last Hotel, with music by Donnacha Dennehy, a co-production between Landmark Productions and Wide Open Opera, premiered in the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2015, played in the Dublin Theatre Festival in September 2015 and started an international tour beginning in Royal Opera House, London, in October 2015. He wrote a musical play with David Bowie entitled Lazarus, which premiered at the New York Theatre Workshop (Off-Broadway) from mid-November 2015 to mid-January 2016. The UK production opened at the Kings Cross Theatre in London on 25 October 2016, ending 22 January 2017. The Galway International Arts Festival has played host to a new departure for Walsh, involving art installation rooms with audio monologues, including Room 303 featuring the voice of Niall Buggy (2014), A Girl's Bedroom featuring the voice of Charlie Murphy (2015), Kitchen featuring the voice of Eileen Walsh (2016) and Bathroom featuring the voice of Paul Reid (2017). These installations have also been shown in the Kennedy Arts Centre, Washington (May 2016) and the Irish Arts Center, New York (May 2017). Walsh wrote the book of the musical Sing Street adapted from the film of the same name written by John Carney. Like Once, the musical was produced at New York Theatre Workshop, with performances beginning in December 2019. The musical was slated for a spring 2020 Broadway premiere before being postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Walsh writes screenplays too, starting with his short film Not a Bad Christmas (1999). He adapted his play Disco Pigs, for the screen and co-wrote the screenplay of Hunger which was directed by Steve McQueen and starred Michael Fassbender as Bobby Sands, the IRA hunger striker who starved himself to death in protest over British rule. He also adapted his play Chatroom for a film directed by Hideo Nakata. He is currently under commission for three films, an adaptation of the children's story Island of the Aunts by Eva Ibbotson (for Cuba Pictures), a film entitled Jules in the City based on the life and music of Rufus Wainwright and an adaptation of Gitta Sereny's book Into That Darkness, about the life of Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps.  Themes  Walsh states that his plays are about ‚Äòsome sort of love and need for calm and peace‚Äô. He says that his play Penelope is about ‚Äòlonging, love, lost love‚Äù.Walsh talk to teachers at Hampstead Theatre 2011 He says that ‚Äòall the plays are effectively about theatre, about writing‚Äô. Also that ‚Äòall the plays are about routines‚Äô. Walsh has often suggested that what interests him is ‚Äòabout me actually getting through the day, you know‚Äô. He speaks of his experience, in London, of extreme OCD. He sees his characters as needing ‚Äòto proclaim and proclaim and proclaim ... and to what? You know, to what, construct rules and sort of mechanisms within their living room but to what end? Only to try to escape them again and probably build more and more routines and patterns and all that sort of thing‚Äô. Walsh also states ‚Äòwhat motivates me in theatre has always been to get close to characters who‚Äôre on the edge of madness, or have entered it. It invigorates me to think that we‚Äôre all the same‚Ä¶.‚Äô Another statement Walsh made was ‚ÄòI don't like seeing everyday life on stage: it's boring. I like my plays to exist in an abstract, expressionistic world: the audience has to learn its rules and then connect with these characters who are, on the surface dreadful monsters'.

He previously played in defence. Career Born in Liverpool, Merseyside, Bayliss joined Rochdale and progressed through the ranks, making his Football League debut in the 1994‚Äì95 season. He went on to make 186 league appearances for them, scoring nine times, before joining Luton Town during 2001‚Äì02. He spent four seasons at Kenilworth Road, making 37 league appearances and also had nine games on loan to Chester City before being released in the summer of 2005. He spent the next season with Wrexham making 22 league appearances and he also had a four-game loan spell back at Rochdale. In the summer of 2006, he joined Lancaster City but then left at the start of November to join Barrow. He later become joint-manager of Barrow. Along with Darren Sheridan he oversaw a major turnaround in Barrow's season. The Bluebirds were 19th in the Conference North when Bayliss and Sheridan took over before an excellent second half to the season saw them finish 5th and qualify for the end of season play-offs. A 4‚Äì0 aggregate win over Telford United in the semi finals was followed by a 1‚Äì0 win against Stalybridge Celtic in the final at Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium and thus a place in the Conference National for the 2008‚Äì09 season. Bayliss and Sheridan successfully kept Barrow in the Conference National the following season, finishing twentieth. With Sheridan he led Barrow to Wembley and the 2010 FA Trophy final where they played Conference National champions Stevenage Borough, who they defeated 2‚Äì1 after extra time to lift the trophy. Bayliss remained registered as a player until the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 season, though his appearances were largely restricted to low-profile cup matches or filling up the substitutes bench. Following allegations made against him, Darren Sheridan was first suspended and then left Barrow in February 2012, leaving Bayliss as the sole manager of the club. Barrow were relegated under Bayliss at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season and, following an unsuccessful start to the new season in the Conference North, Bayliss left the club in November 2013.

Plot The actor who annually plays Sinterklaas dies just before the arrival of the television crew. A mysterious new Sinterklaas named Jan (Michiel Romeyn) replaces him. Shortly after his public appearance, he rescues a child who fell into a canal, but runs away when people realize what happened and begin crowding around. He is found by the production assistant of the television show next day, and agrees to appear in television shows, when he is informed that playing Sinterklaas is a paying job. He becomes quite popular on television because of his alternative style. Klaasje (Wendy van Dijk) has left her husband Dennis (Peter Paul Muller), because he cheated on her with a young and attractive elementary school teacher (Chantal Janzen). Dennis wants her back, but his chances seem to plummet when she has a fling with a 16-year-old boy (Valerio Zeno), whom she meets at her father's funeral (her father was the previous \\"Sinterklaas\\" actor). Klaasje‚Äôs best friend Simone (Anneke Blok), the mother of the girl rescued by Sinterklaas, is the linchpin in her family. Her husband Ted (Thomas Acda) often feels redundant. He loses his job, but he is afraid to tell his domineering wife. Swimming instructor Victor (Paul de Leeuw) looks forward to marrying his love Kees (Daan Schuurmans), an undertaker. But Kees has doubts and fears about committed life. During the marriage ceremony, he walks away without saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô. Victor's sister Kiki (Carice van Houten), a saleswoman at the jewellery section of De Bijenkorf, has always dreamt of a Prince Charming. During the arrival of Sinterklaas, Kiki almost runs into Crown Prince Valentine (Jeroen Spitzenberger), while driving a horse carriage. Kiki is dressed as a campaign gift and the prince takes her in his arms as she tries to get down from the carriage. Prince Valentine falls in love with her. Next morning he visits De Bijenkorf to see Kiki. But Kiki desists from seeing him, and rejects him on the grounds that he will not take her seriously. To still come into contact with her, Prince Valentine dresses as Black Peter, does antics at De Bijenkorf for work. In the evening, he (dressed as Black Pieter) offers to drop her home and ends up having a wild night with her. The next morning, however, he sneaks away through the window without saying goodbye to Kiki. Kiki follows him to his hotel and confronts him. It turns out that Kiki knew all along that Prince Valentine was playing Black Pieter but just wanted to see how far he would go for her. They end up kissing each other. On the night of Sinterklaas Eve, Jan again runs away before his appearance in the show. He is spotted by Ted who recognizes him to be his child's rescuer. Ted invites Jan, dressed as Sinterklaas, to his house for a beer. The neighborhood children gradually flock to his house, as word spreads of Jan's presence. The television crew also eventually comes there. During his TV interview, he speaks candidly about his life and his regrets. He also tells that the name of his son is Kees and that he abandoned his family when his son was three years old. The 5 December Special TV show comes to an end and Sinterklaas is seen walking out onto the snowy street. As he walks and looks around, all the couples are shown one by one to have found out what to do with their lives. Having found his father on the television show, Kees drives with Victor to meet him. They come across him in the middle of the road as they were driving. The movie ends with Jan, dressed as Sinterklaas, embracing Kees.Plot Outline Dutch Wikipedia (translation) Background The story is inspired by the film Love Actually (2003).

The country's domain suffix is '.bh'. A 2004 study showed a liberal filtering system is used in Bahrain, one which can be easily bypassed, however more recent events have shown more sophisticated and pervasive filtering. In January 2009, Bahrain has started blocking a vastly increased number of sites through the Information Affairs Authority (IAA). The new filtering has had a noticeable impact in internet access speeds for all traffic. In 2010, there were about 694,000 internet users in Bahrain, or 55% of the population. According to the World Bank, over 90% of the population is connected to the internet between 2010-2014. This later rose to 96.4% (an estimated 1.29 million online) in 2015, thus making Bahrain the country with the highest internet penetration percentage in the Middle East. Internet penetration and usage The growth in fixed telephone lines and the Internet has made Bahrain a regional information and communications technology leader. The country's connectivity score (a statistic which measures both Internet access and fixed and mobile telephone lines) is 210.4 percent per person, while the regional average in Arab States of the Persian Gulf is 135.37 percent. The number of Bahraini Internet users has risen from 40,000 in 2000 to 250,000 in 2008, or from 5.95 to 33 percent of the population. The telecom market witnessed a remarkable development in November 2008 when Mena Telecom launched its nationwide WiMAX network, a service that provides high speed wireless voice and data services. To encourage creativity in domestic online content, in 2005 Bahrain launched an e-content award organised by the eGovernment Authority in Bahrain and the Bahrain Internet Society. The goal of the award is to select quality online content and to promote creativity and innovation in the development of new media applications in Bahrain. Bahrain's online community is small but dynamic. As of January 2008, there were over 535 websites based in Bahrain, focusing on 25 different themes (e.g., public forums); 59 websites for governmental organizations; and about 200 blogs, the majority of which are anonymous blogs. Internet users in Bahrain use the Internet to debate sensitive issues and to exchange content that is not available in the traditional media. The authorities have blocked a number of news, religion, human rights, and humour Web sites run by Bahrainis and by non-Bahrainis, but users manage to access them using proxies. Bahrain's telecom market is regulated by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), which was established by Legislative Decree No. 48 of 2002 to protect the interests of subscribers and users and to promote effective and fair competition among established and new licensed operators. As of 2008, the TRA has licensed 22 Internet Service Providers, the largest of which is Batelco.

The Commission stated that it was \\"aware\\" of the impact of the use of social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, has had on some major social and political events in the contemporary world. \\"The commission found numerous examples of exaggeration and misinformation, some highly inflammatory, that were disseminated through social media,\\" the report stated. Another issue raised in the findings was that mainstream media in Bahrain ignored views of opposition groups. \\"The lack of access to mainstream media creates frustration within opposition groups and results in these groups resorting to other media such as social media,\\" stated the report. This, it said, could have a \\"destabilizing effect\\" because social media outlets were both untraceable and unaccountable. The commission recommended the Bahrain government to relax censorship and allow the opposition greater access to television and radio broadcasts as well as print media. Errors The BICI team also met officials from Information Affairs Authority (IAA), who provided a file concerning the involvement of the international media in the events of February and March. The IAA alleged that there was incitement practiced by some foreign media against Bahrain. It also stated that the international media made factual errors when reporting on events. \\"Much of this material contained derogatory language and inflammatory coverage of events, and some may have been defamatory,\\"said the BICI. \\"However, the commission did not find any evidence of media coverage that constituted hate speech or incitement to violence.\\" http://www.gulf-daily- news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=318481 See also *Telecommunications in Bahrain References This article incorporates text from the OpenNet Initiative's August 6, 2009 Bahrain profile, which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

Career Brown was born in Dunfermline and, upon leaving school, worked at Blairhall Colliery, where he also played football for the colliery's team. In April 1951 he came to the attention of English Football League Second Division club Blackburn Rovers and signed a contract with the Lancashire-based club. He spent four years at Ewood Park and was a regular in the club's reserve team, but proved unable to dislodge more established players from the Rovers' first team. In four seasons with the club Brown was never selected to play a first team match. In 1955 Brown was allowed to leave Rovers, and signed for Newport County of the Third Division South. He soon became a favourite with the Somerton Park crowd, and was a regular in the team for four seasons, making over 140 appearances in total and scoring 15 goals. In the 1957‚Äì58 season he helped the club to its best finishing position for six seasons. In 1959 he left the club to join Fourth Division club Gillingham. In his first season with the Kent-based club he played regularly as a winger and scored 12 goals to finish the season as the team's second- highest goalscorer behind Pat Terry. He only scored one goal the following season, however, and departed Priestfield Stadium in the summer of 1961. He later played non-league football for Ashford Town (Kent) and Sittingbourne.

The conflict was fought between the Illinois and Michigan Territory militias and Sauk chief Black Hawk and his band of warriors, who were fleeing their homeland following the Fox Wars. The Wisconsin Heights Battlefield is the only intact battle site from the Indian Wars in the U.S. Midwest. Today, the battlefield is managed and preserved by the state of Wisconsin as part of the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway. In 2002, it was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. History Knowledge of the history of native tribes before the middle of the 18th century in the area of Wisconsin Heights Battlefield is limited. Samuel de Champlain is said to have heard of native tribes living \\"many leagues beyond Lake Huron\\" during the 17th century. The group Champlain heard about was known as the \\"Fire Nation\\" or the \\"Mascoutens.\\" The Mascoutens, along with the Kickapoo and Miami were probably settled in the area around the Fox River and claimed much of the land to the south, including the battlefield, as their hunting grounds. Eventually, the Mascoutens, Kickapoo and Miami migrated further south along the shore of Lake Michigan.Cole, Harry Ellsworth, ed. A Standard History of Sauk County, Wisconsin: Volume I, Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1918, pp. 166‚Äì184. Retrieved September 16, 2007. The relocated Mascoutens were replaced by the influx of Sauk and Fox following the Fox Wars in the western Great Lakes and Detroit regions. After the conflicts, the remaining Sauk and Fox sought refuge together in lands further west, extending north from the Wisconsin River to the Illinois River in the south. Other settlements were established north of the Missouri River.James Lewis, \\"Background,\\" The Black Hawk War of 1832, Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, Northern Illinois University.

The area known as the Wisconsin Heights Battlefield was the site of the penultimate engagement of the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia and allies, and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. The battle took place in what is now Dane County, near the present-day Sauk County‚ÄìDane County line. Despite being outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. The battlefield has been described as \\"beautiful and romantic\\". Through the early 1920s the area remained privately owned.O. D.

The monument carried the following inscription: For 30 years the DAR marker stood as the sole monument to the battle.

It is not entirely certain that this is the site of the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, but historical sources identify this town and section, and the terrain matches ridges and swamps in descriptions of the battle. Archaeologists working with the Wisconsin DNR have looked for evidence of the battle by visual inspection, by metal detector, and by ground-penetrating radar. Along with modern shotgun shell casings and pop- tops, they found several lead balls from the era of the Black Hawk War, two cartridge case buckles, and a fastener for a leather bag. These don't seem like much evidence, but no archaeological evidence at all has been turned up at other Black Hawk War battlefields. With Notes External links *Black Hawk's account of the battle *Col.

Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences. For him, the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, and expressed it in this way: Aristotle and St. Augustine‚Äôs work influenced Descartes's cogito argument. Additionally, there is similarity between Descartes‚Äôs work and that of the Scottish philosopher, George Campbell‚Äôs 1776 publication, titled Philosophy of Rhetoric. In his Meditations on First Philosophy he writes, ‚Äú[b]ut what then am I? A thing which thinks. What is a thing which thinks? It is a thing which doubts, understands, [conceives], affirms, denies, wills, refuses, which also imagines and feels.\\" Cartesians view the mind as being wholly separate from the corporeal body. Sensation and the perception of reality are thought to be the source of untruth and illusions, with the only reliable truths to be had in the existence of a metaphysical mind. Such a mind can perhaps interact with a physical body, but it does not exist in the body, nor even in the same physical plane as the body. The question of how mind and body interact would be a persistent difficulty for Descartes and his followers, with different Cartesians providing different answers. To this point Descartes wrote, \\"we should conclude from all this, that those things which we conceive clearly and distinctly as being diverse substances; as we regard mind and body to be, are really substances essentially distinct one from the other; and this is the conclusion of the Sixth Meditation.\\" Therefore, we can see that, while mind and body are indeed separate, because they can be separated from each other, but, Descartes realizes, the mind is a whole, inseparable from itself, while the body can become separated from itself to some extent, as in when one loses an arm or a leg.  Ontology  Descartes held that all existence consists in three distinct substances, each with its own essence: * matter, possessing extension in three dimensions * mind, possessing self-conscious thought * God, possessing necessary existence  Epistemology  Descartes brought the question of how reliable knowledge may be obtained (epistemology) to the fore of philosophical enquiry. Many consider this to be Descartes' most lasting influence on the history of philosophy. Cartesianism is a form of rationalism because it holds that scientific knowledge can be derived a priori from 'innate ideas' through deductive reasoning. Thus Cartesianism is opposed to both Aristotelianism and empiricism, with their emphasis on sensory experience as the source of all knowledge of the world. For Descartes, the faculty of deductive reason is supplied by God and may therefore be trusted because God would not deceive us. Geographical dispersal In the Netherlands, where Descartes had lived for a long time, Cartesianism was a doctrine popular mainly among university professors and lecturers. In Germany the influence of this doctrine was not relevant and followers of Cartesianism in the German- speaking border regions between these countries (e.g., the iatromathematician Yvo Gaukes from East Frisia) frequently chose to publish their works in the Netherlands. In France, it was very popular, and gained influence also among Jansenists such as Antoine Arnauld, though there also, as in Italy, it became opposed by the Church. In Italy, the doctrine failed to make inroads, probably since Descartes' works were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1663. In England, because of religious and other reasons, Cartesianism was not widely accepted. Though Henry More was initially attracted to the doctrine, his own changing attitudes toward Descartes mirrored those of the country: \\"quick acceptance, serious examination with accumulating ambivalence, final rejection.\\" Notable Cartesians Principia philosophiae, 1685 * Antoine Arnauld * Balthasar Bekker * Tommaso CampaillaCristofolini, Paul; \\"Campailla, Thomas\\" in Biographical Dictionary of Italians - Volume 17 (1974), Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana.

She featured or starred in over 25 films during the 1950s and 1960s.  Life  Jill Adams was born Jill Siggins in London in 1930, the daughter of the silent-screen actress Molly Adair (real name Mary Marguerite Potter). Jill's New Zealand-born father, Arthur James Siggins, had met the Irish-American Adair when she was on location filming The Blue Lagoon (1923). Siggins, a former member of the British South Africa Policehttp://www.mohammadmossadegh.com/news/the-afro-american/arthur-james- siggins/ and an expert animal handler, worked on the film The Four Feathers (1921), and later wrote a book about the experience, Shooting with Rifle and Camerahttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jill-adams-actress-billed- as-britains-monroe-886120.html. Jill was one of four children. When she was six years old, she moved to Wales where Jill continued her education, after which she worked for four years on a farm. Her ambition was to become an artist, and she moved to London to pursue that career, taking work as a sales assistant, secretary and window dresser. After working as a window dresser, by 1944 Adams was an assistant artist at Mr & Mrs Jones, a department store, where she was required to attend fashion shows and sketch the clothes. One day a model failed to arrive, and Adams, found to be the perfect size, stepped in, thus beginning her modelling career, which included a flag-hoisting recruitment poster for the Women's Royal Naval Service https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/11/1. During her modelling days she was 'discovered' and begin an acting career that spanned two decades. Her most notable films were comedies, at which she excelled, such as Doctor at Sea, Brothers in Law and The Green Man, in which she starred with Alastair Sim and George Cole. She also did some stage and radio work. In 1951 she married a young American navy yeoman, Jim Adams, whose surname she adopted professionally, which resulted in the birth of a daughter, Tina. The same year, Jill Adams had a part in a late-night stage revue, On with the New, starring Anthony Newley, and though her marriage ended in 1953, she began taking bit roles in movies ‚Äì dancing with Nigel Patrick in Forbidden Cargo (1953), appearing in the Arthur Askey comedy The Love Match (1954), and in Doctor at Sea (1955) with Dirk Bogarde. She had one of her first substantial roles in the sprightly \\"Quota quickie\\" movie One Jump Ahead (1955), in a rare villainous portrayal as a murderess who was once an old flame of a reporter (Paul Carpenter) who is usually \\"one jump ahead\\" of the police. Adams was one of Rex Harrison's seven wives in the sophisticated comedy The Constant Husband (1955). At the peak of her acting career in 1957, Adams married the well-known BBC TV and radio personality Peter Haigh, and had a second daughter, Peta Louise. Adams appeared with Attenborough again in The Scamp (1957), and was given star billing in an Australian movie,Dust in the Sun (1958), but it had limited distribution. In 1960/61 she featured in a television series, The Flying Doctor, based on the real-life activities of the Royal Flying Doctor Service serving the Australian outback https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jill-adams-actress-billed-as- britains-monroe-886120.html. Her career at this point seemed to lose direction. Death Over My Shoulder (1958) and Crosstrap (1960) had been poor \\"B\\" movies, and her roles in Carry On Constable (1960) and Doctor in Distress (1963) were small. The Yellow Teddy Bears (1963) was an exploitation thriller (its US title was Gutter Girls), and her small role in Promise Her Anything (1965), starring Warren Beatty and Leslie Caron, was to be her last.In 1971, the whole family moved to the Algarve, in southern Portugal, where they ran a small hotel for several years in the village of Albufeira. When her second marriage ended, she continued with a restaurant career, accompanied by her partner Mike. Some years later she retired from the business and with her new partner, Alan \\"Buster\\" Jones, an accountant, went to live just outside Lisbon. They later moved to Spain, where they enjoyed homes close to Alicante, then Barcelona and eventually in the Costa del Sol. After Buster died in 1996, she moved back to Portugal, to be with her granddaughter, Emma, and her great- granddaughter, Tania, and began painting again. She had cancer from 2005 until her death in 2008.

Plot outline A mysterious millionaire, Raffles Haw, comes to reside in Tamfield in Staffordshire. Even before he arrives, people start gossiping about him. As his house is being constructed, people wonder at the number of workers, their speed, and the complete disregard for the amount of money spent. When Haw arrives, he acquaints himself with the McIntyre family, which consists of Robert, his sister Laura, and their father. McIntyre senior had been a prosperous gun merchant, but has gone bankrupt and lost his sanity. Laura is engaged to Hector, the son of the vicar, Mr. Spurling. Hector is a sailor who is summoned for Naval duty at the beginning of the novel. Disregarding McIntyre senior as a greedy beggar, Haw sets about to alleviate the misery of the people of Tamfield through the agency of the McIntyre siblings and Mr. Spurling. He saves many families and businesses with his timely financial succour. He has limitless funds, due to having discovered a process to turn lead into gold. With the passage of time, he becomes disillusioned because his philanthropic activities‚Äîthough they improve the situations of the recipients‚Äîdon't improve the recipients themselves. Instead of becoming better citizens, most become parasites reliant upon alms from the millionaire. Despondent, he seeks the counsel of his fianc√©e, Laura McIntyre, the one person he supposes to be true to him. Unbeknownst to him, Laura has accepted his proposal of marriage without ending her previous engagement to Hector Spurling. As Raffles and Laura are talking, Hector enters the room, his service having ended earlier than expected. When Raffles discovers Laura and Hector are still engaged, he is heartbroken. The fallen millionaire locks himself in his laboratory, destroys his equipment and his immense fortune, and later is found dead. The process that he used to build his fortune is unrecoverable.

Admissions It is a grammar school, with Richard Booth as the Headmaster since September 2016.http://www.wallingtongirls.sutton.sch.uk/Heads-Welcome The school is also twinned with Wallington County Grammar School for Boys, in many events due to both the schools being in the same area as each other. Girls can join the boys' school's sixth form. Around 2000 girls each year apply for 210 available places. The school is in Woodcote Green on the A237, around a half-mile north of the A2022 crossroads, at the junction of Sandy Lane South, Woodmansterne Lane, and Woodcote Road (A237). It is near the southern edge of the borough of Sutton, and the western edge of Croydon. It is only one mile north-east of Surrey, specifically Woodmansterne.  History  Wallington High School for Girls was established in 1888 by a collective of nuns. The school building has since changed many times, and now accommodates an estimated 2310 students with 210 in each year group, as well as a Sixth Form College. It was originally on Stanley Park Road in Carshalton, known as Wallington County Grammar School for Girls, the Wallington County School for Girls, Wallington County School, or the County School for Girls, Wallington. This site is now Bandon Hill primary school. Wallington High School for Girls It moved to Woodcote Road in 1965, the same year it changed its administration from Surrey County Council to the borough of Sutton. In the late 1970s it had around 750 girls with 150 in the sixth form. In the 1990s it became grant-maintained school. =Headteachers= * Agnes Mark (1928‚Äì2005) from 1964 to 1980, later Head of Croydon High School from 1980 to 1990 * Amy Bull CBE (1902‚Äì1982) from 1937 to 1964, President from 1960 to 1962 of the Association of Headmistresses *Dr Dorothy Atkinson *Miss Margaret Edwards *Barbara Greatorex BSc *Jane Burton BSc *Richard Booth Church Although the school itself is non-religious, Springfield Church uses the school premises for its worship every Sunday at 10.30.

The Houses Wallington has seven different forms in each year group. Each form is a member of one of the seven different houses, each named after an influential woman. Each house has two Year 11 House Captains, who are responsible for organising the annual fete and events and activities for their house. However, there will be the addition of an extra house as of the academic year of 2012/2013 and this new house will be called Curie with the house colour of Cerise. This is due to the school needing to expand in order to accommodate the growing number of primary school students leaving primary education without a place in a secondary school. Uniform and house names The school uniform consists of a navy and green kilt; a baby blue shirt (these may be short or long sleeved);a green v-neck jumper or cardigan and a navy blazer. However, students that joined the school before 2006 will not have blazers as these items were not on the school uniform regulations as of that time.

The link allows through running between the main Swiss rail network and the isolated line east of Annemasse in Haute-Savoie, which was served until 2013 by French SNCF services. A new station was constructed on the route at Gare des Eaux-Vives and the line between this station and the border was replaced with a double track line in tunnel. Track already existed as far as Stade de Gen√®ve station, and the full route opened on 12 December 2019. Background The project was to build the remaining section of an outer ring link connecting Geneva, (Cornavin station) with Annemasse running through Geneva's west, south and south eastern suburbs. It was planned to enhance the public transport network of the Geneva region, which increasingly over the years has become a trans-frontier conurbation, with thousands of cross-border daily commuters travelling between the Geneva area and surrounding regions of France. It links the CFF route Lausanne ‚Äì Geneva Cornavin ‚Äì Geneva Airport and the SNCF route Geneva Cornavin ‚Äì Bellegarde-sur- Valserine ‚Äì Lyon with lines in the Haute Savoie serving Thonon-les-Bains, √âvian-les-Bains, and the Arve valley to St Gervais and Chamonix as well as Annemasse to Annecy. The origins of the project go back to 1850. In 1888 the Eaux-Vives to Annemasse line was opened. At Eaux Vives, the abutments were built for a bridge across the main road on the alignment of the proposed link round to Cornavin. This Geneva ring was part of a proposed new link to the Simplon route to Italy, using a direct route from Paris and Dijon under the Jura mountains via the Faucille tunnel to Geneva, round the 'CEVA' route and along the south side of Lake Geneva to St-Maurice. This was never realised due to competition from the Vaud canton which succeeded in keeping the Dijon ‚Äì Vallorbe ‚Äì Lausanne ‚Äì St Maurice route as the main Simplon line to Italy. A contract of 1912 between the Confederation and the canton said that each partner would pay one third of construction costs of CEVA and SBB a further third. In 1949 the first section of the ring was built, connecting Cornavin Station to a large new freight marshalling yard at La Praille, but was used only for freight. Until 2013 the Eaux-Vives ‚Äì Annemasse line remained an isolated shuttle served by SNCF trains, although the line (infrastructure) was legally the Geneva State Railway (). After numerous false starts over a century, the ring line project was reborn in the 1990s and a passenger service was introduced on the ' line as far as Lancy-Pont-Rouge station which opened on 19 December 2002 and is the present terminus for the regional trains coming from Coppet in Vaud, after passing through Geneva's Cornavin station. Pont Rouge acts as an interchange to the Geneva tram route 15. The first official CEVA project work was undertaken in the last two years, and consisted of widening Cornavin station on its south side, to allow room for a platform for use by CEVA trains. This entailed the wholesale moving of a historic listed building by a few metres. Construction Approval of the plans by the Federal Office of Transport was given on 5 May 2008, but opponents brought the case to court. The Federal Administrative Court rejected the plea in June 2011 Media release 16 June 2011 of the Federal Administrative Court but the opponents also took the last step, going to the Federal Court. On 28 March 2012, the Federal Administrative Court rejected all remaining objections, thus concluding the legal process and allowing the works to proceed freely. In 2012, the Eaux-Vives station closed and the disused Ch√™ne-Bourg station was reopened until 1 April 2013, when all train services stopped to allow construction to start. A substitute bus service from Annemasse to Eaux-Vives is running. CEVA line will be electrified with the Swiss 15 kV 16.7 Hz including a track to one of the Annemasse platforms. To simplify electrification situation in the Geneva area, the portion between Gen√®ve- Cornavin and Bellegarde was changed from 1500 V DC to 25 kV 50 Hz AC in Summer 2014. The new service over the CEVA line, expected to open in December 2019, will be branded as L√©man Express and operated with new Stadler FLIRT electric multiple unit trains built in Switzerland by Stadler Rail. Route Upon completion a continuous railway route will run from Cornavin Station via La Praille, Bachet-de-Pesay, over the river Arve, in tunnel under the commune of Champel, and on past Eaux-Vives, underground to Annemasse, if a financing for the French part of the new infrastructure can be found. The CEVA project consists of four principal sectors: # Between Cornavin station and Bachet-de- Pesay: the CFF line (which has existed since 1949) between Cornavin and Gare de la Praille will be refurbished. # Between Bachet-de-Pesay and the Gare des Eaux-Vives: a new CFF line will be built which will cross the river Arve by means of a bridge then run under the commune of Champel by means of a tunnel. # Between Gare des Eaux-Vives and the Swiss-French border : the single-track SNCF line which has existed since 1888 will be removed and a new double-track underground line will be built covering the same route as the existing above ground line. # Between the border and Annemasse: the single-track SNCF line which has been in place since 1888 should be upgraded. However, until now neither the owner R√©seau Ferr√© de France (RFF, now SNCF R√©seau) nor French authorities have made a step towards financing and realizing this part of the line.

Crackle was launched in Canada in September 2010. Beginning in late 2015, several of the service's original series were made available only through the local services Crave TV and Shomi. Following the closure of Shomi in fall 2016, new productions continued to be released exclusively on Crave TV, as well as Amazon Prime Video and Super Channel (Canada). Crackle's Canadian operations were shut down on June 28, 2018, and its content was moved to Bell Media's CTV Movies and CTV Throwback services. Despite Crackle being a Sony owned service, the successor CTV app has not launched on Sony's PlayStation or Smart TV platforms, but ironically has become available on competitor Microsoft's Xbox One console and Samsung's Smart TVs. As of late 2016, Crackle in Latin America is only available as an ad-free paid service.

His parents, who were ethnic Armenians had fled to Iraq in 1915 to escape the Armenian Genocide. Jirair's father was from Sebastia and his mother was from Malatia. Hovnanian's father, Stepan K. Hovnanian, owned and operated a construction company based in Baghdad. Hovnanian was one of six children in his family. He attended a Jesuit high school in Kirkuk.\\"An entrepreneur's final act of generosity\\", Philly.com, 17 August 2007. Accessed 12 July 2016. The Hovnanian family, including Jirair, emigrated to the United States in 1948. The Hovnanians spoke very little English when they arrived in the US. The family settled in North Philadelphia. Jirair graduated from the Wharton School of Business in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in business. He also holds an MBA from Stanford Business School. Marriage Jirair Hovnanian married Elizabeth Vosbikian, whose family founded the Quickie Manufacturing Corporation, which manufactured popular products such as the Quickie broom and mops. Career Jirair and his three brothers founded a family construction company, Hovnanian Brothers Corp, in 1959. In 1964, Jirair split off from his brothers' company and founded his own construction business, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey. Over the next 40 years, the company would operate throughout South Jersey, mainly in Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties. One of Jirair's brothers, Kevork, later founded Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc, a publicly traded firm based in Red Bank, New Jersey. The brothers' companies are not related professionally. Jirair championed New Jersey state laws in the 1970s to protect home buyers from unscrupulous builders and realtors. The laws later enacted included the Municipal Land Use Law, the 10 year Home Owner's Warranty Program, and the Uniform Construction Code. Hovnanian and his firm, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, had participated in the ABC reality show, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, and completed the project just 10 days before his death in August 2007. Hovnanian's company built a home for free in Pennsauken, New Jersey, for the Marrero family, which was made up of Victor Marrero and his five sons. The home, which was built in just 96 hours, was completed for the show and the Marrero family, on August 4, 2007. Hovnanian's family later told the Philadelphia Inquirer that participating in the show was one of his dreams. Victor Marrero, the recipient of the episode's new home built by Hovnanian, told the newspaper following Hovnanian's death, \\"Mr. Hovnanian gave me and my sons a lifeline. I will love him all my life. He was quiet and always in the back. He was not a showoff. He told me 'I know you and your boys will be all right.' He threw so much love at me.\\" Jirair Hovnanian served as president of the New Jersey Builders Association and the lifelong director of the National Association of Home Builders. Interests Jirair Hovnanian participated in a number of personal interest and philanthropic causes throughout his life. He was an avid sport fisherman. In August 1992 he and four others survived the sinking of his mega yacht, Lady Anna east-southeast off Cape May, New Jersey.http://www.yachtspotter.com/focard3.php?foo=FG010 Hovnanian and two scientists teamed up to found Nature's Wonder, a Philadelphia metropolitan area company that extracts a product from peat that encourages plant growth. Hovnanian was, himself, a champion grower of roses. Hovnanian founded the Center for the Advancement of Natural Discoveries using Light Emission (CANDLE) in Armenia, his family's homeland before his parents fled to Iraq. The center, which is located in Yerevan, Armenia, \\"generates beams of ultraviolet light for protein crystallography.\\" It helps to employ Armenian scientists who would otherwise have to move abroad to find work. He received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2006 from the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, Inc. Death Jirair Hovnanian suffered heart failure at his home in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey and was pronounced dead at Virtua West Jersey Hospital, Marlton, New Jersey, 10 days after completing the episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. He was 80 years old. His funeral was held at St. Gregory's Armenian Apostolic Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and he was interred in Cinnaminson, New Jersey. He was survived by his immediate family, i.e. his widow, Elizabeth; their sons, Stephen and Peter and Jirair's three brothers and two sisters. References External links *J.S.

The commune name was Laudun until February 1, 2001. Population The \\"Camp de C√©sar\\", an Ancient Roman site. Wine Laudun is one of the communes producing C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages wines, red, ros√© and white. The Rh√¥ne is one of the main areas for French wines. Some have their own AOC (Appellation d'origine control√©e) as Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, Hermitage and Gigondas -others are selling their wines under the umbrella C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne AOC. In 1953 the INAO (Institut National des Appellations d'Origine) chose 4 villages with a good reputation, but not considered quite good enough for their own AOC: Gigondas (has today its own AOC), Cairanne, Chusclan and Laudun (which include neighboring St. Victor la Coste and Tresques). These wine could add their name to the general AOC and sell the wine as \\"C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Laudun\\", if they lived up to strict conditions as to yield per hectare (35 hl instead of 50), alcoholic strength (minimum 121,5% alcohol etc. Later this group was extended with an increasing number of Villages -as Vacqueyras (1955, also later having AOC), Vinsobres (recently also an AOC) and recognized as AOC \\"C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages\\". Today some 15-20 villages are allowed to add their own name to \\"C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages\\", while another 30-40 can use the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages without their name added. Close to the small village is the Camp de C√©sar plateau, where amphorae has been found, indicating an old Roman settlement, perhaps from C√©sar's days. Laudun was originally better known for white wines than reds -and in 1375 wine was sent to the papal cellars, then still in Avignon. King Louis XIII was in 1629 offered a barrel of Laudun, also white. Today, however, far more red than white wine is produced from Grenache and Syrah varietals, a wine with some body and fruit, but not among the most heavy, pleasant for drinking fairly young -not unlike the neighbor to the south -Lirac (AOC). The main producer is the coop, Cave les Quatre Chemins. There are a few private cellars, inc. Pelaqui√©. Only part of the production is sold as Laudun Rh√¥ne Villages. The rest is sold as straight C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne or Vin de Pays (often named Gard after the department, Laudun is situated in). In total app. 1 million bottles are produced.

Porter for Edison Studios and directed by J. Searle Dawley. It features the first leading screen role of the legendary American filmmaker D. W. Griffith, whose directorial debut was released just six months after he performed in this production. Griffith's casting in the Edison \\"photoplay\\" began when he found himself stranded and broke in New York City after a play he authored had failed. Desperate for money, he responded to Edison's offer to pay $15 to anyone who submitted a useable treatment or scenario based on the Puccini opera Tosca. Porter rejected Griffith's submission, but the studio executive did offer him the lead role in Rescued from an Eagle's Nest. A full print of this film survives in the extensive collection of moving images at the Museum of Modern Art. Only one other film in which Griffith appears as an actor survives. Plot A woodsman leaves a hut followed by a woman with their baby. Nearby some men chop down a tree. The baby is left outside the hut, but an eagle flies away with it. The mother comes outside and sees what has happened. She picks up a gun and aims, but decides against it. She tells the woodsmen and they get to the cliff where the eagle's nest is. One of the men is let down on a rope to the nest. However the eagle attacks, but he kills it and kicks it off the cliff. He then picks up the baby, is hoisted up the cliff, and returns the baby to its mother. Cast * D. W. Griffith as father * Henry B.

The brief outdoor footage showing the woodsmen chopping down a tree was taken at an undetermined site, although the location was likely a short distance north of the Bronx. Although very primitive by modern film-production standards, the simulations presented on screen of a stuffed, articulated eagle flapping its wings while appearing to hold a real child in flight no doubt thrilled some filmgoers in 1908; however, the reviewer at the time for The Moving Picture World found the overall effect unconvincing. \\"The trick\\", he remarked, \\"of the eagle with its wire wings is too evident to the audience, while the fight between the man and eagle is poor and out of vision.\\"\\"Editorial/Out Visits\\", The Moving Picture World (New York), February 1, 1908, p. 71.

According to Campbell & Oblinger (2007), accrediting agencies, governments, parents and students are all calling for the adoption of new modern and efficient ways of improving and monitoring student success. This has ushered the higher education system into an era characterized by increased scrutiny from the various stakeholders. For instance, the Bradley review acknowledges that benchmarking activities such as student engagement serve as indicators for gauging the institution's quality (Commonwealth Government of Australia, 2008). Increased competition, accreditation, assessment and regulation are the major factors encouraging the adoption of analytics in higher education. Although institutions of higher learning gather much vital data that can significantly aid in solving problems like attrition and retention, the collected data is not being analysed adequately and hence translated into useful data (Goldstein, 2005.) Subsequently, higher education leadership are forced to make critical and vital decisions based on inadequate information that could be achieved by properly utilising and analysing the available data (Norris, Leonard, & strategic Initiatives Inc., 2008). This gives rise to strategic problems. This setback also depicts itself at the tactical level. Learning and teaching at institutions of higher education if often a diverse and complex experience. Each and every teacher, student or course is quite different. However, LMS is tasked with taking care of them all. LMS is at the centre of academic analytics. It records each and every student and staff's information and results in a click within the system. When this crucial information is added, compared and contrasted with different enterprise information systems provides the institution with a vast array of useful information that can be harvested to gain a competitive edge (Dawson & McWilliam, 2008; Goldstein, 2005; Heathcoate & Dawson, 2005). In order to retrieve meaningful information from institution sources i.e. LMS, the information has to be correctly interpreted against a basis of educational efficiency, and this action requires analysis from people with learning and teaching skills. Therefore, a collaborative approach is required from both the people guarding the data and those who will interpret it, otherwise the data will remain to be a total waste (Baepler & Murdoch, 2010). Decision making at its most basic level is based on presumption or intuition (a person can make conclusions and decisions based on experience without having to do data analysis) (Siemens & Long, 2011). However, a lot of decisions made at institutions of higher learning are too vital to be based on anecdote, presumption or intuition since significant decisions need to be backed by data and facts. Analytics, which is often termed ‚Äúbusiness intelligence‚Äù, has come out as new software and hardware that enables businesses to gather and analyse large amounts of information or data. The analytics process is made up of gathering, analysing, data manipulation and employing the results to answer critical questions such as ‚Äòwhy‚Äô. Analytics was first applied in the admissions department in higher education institutions. The institutions normally used some formulas to choose students from a large pool of applicants. These formulas drew their information from high school transcripts and standardized test scores. In today's world, analytics is commonly used in administrative units such as fund raising and admissions. The use and application of academic analytics is meant to grow due to the ever-increasing concerns about student success and accountability. Academic analytics primarily marries complex and vast data with predictive modelling and statistical techniques to better decision making. Current academic analytics initiatives are bent to use data to predict students experiencing difficulty (Arnold, & Pistilli, 2012, April). This allows advisors and faculty members to intervene by tailoring procedures which will meet the student's learning needs (Arnold, 2010). As such, academic analytics possesses the ability to improve learning, student success and teaching. Analytics has become a valuable tool for institutions because of its ability to predict, model and improve decision making.  Analytic Steps  Analysis is composed of five basic steps: capture, report, predict, act and refine. Capture: All analytic efforts are centred on data. Consequently, academic analytics can be rooted in data from various sources such as a CMS, and financial systems (Campbell, Finnegan, & Collins, 2006). Additionally, the data comes in various different formats for example spread sheets. Also, data can be got from the institution's external environment. To capture data, academic analytics needs to determine the type of available data, methods of harnessing it and the formats it is in. Report: After the data has been captured and stored in a central location, analysts will examine the data, perform queries, identify patterns, trends and exceptions depicted by the data. The standard deviation and mean (descriptive statistics) are mostly generated. Predict: After analysing the warehoused data through the use of statistics, a predictive model is developed. These models vary depending on the question nature and type of data. To develop a probability, these models employ statistical regression concepts and techniques. Predictions are made after the use of statistical algorithms. Act: The major goal and aim of analytics is to enable the institution to take actions based on the probabilities and predictions made. These actions might vary from invention to information. The interventions to address problems might be in the form of a personal email, phone call or an automated contact from faculty advisors about study resources and skills, such as office hours or help sessions. Undoubtedly, institutions have to come up with appropriate mechanisms for impact measurement; such as did the students actually respond or attend the help sessions when invited. Refine: Academic analytics should also be made up of a process aimed at self-improvement. Statistics processes should be continually updated since the measurement of project impacts is not a one-time static effort but rather a continual effort. For instance, admission analytics should be updated or revised yearly. =Comprehending Involved Stakeholders= Analytics affects executive officers, students, faculty members, IT staff and student affairs staff. Whereas students will be keen to know academic analytics will affect their grades, faculty members will be interested in finding out how the information and data can be appropriated for other purposes (Pistilli, Arnold & Bethune, 2012). Moreover, the institution staff will be focussed on finding how the analysis will enable them to effectively accomplish their jobs while the institution president will be focussed on freshman retention and increase in graduation rates.  Criticisms  Analytics have been criticised for various reasons such as profiling. Their main use is to profile students into successful and unsuccessful categories. However, some individuals argue that profiling of students tends to bias people's behaviours and expectations (Ferguson, 2012). Additionally, there is no clear guidelines on which profiling issues should be prohibited or allowed in institutions of higher learning.

On September 9, 1895, at the age of 17, Dawley performed professionally on stage for the first time at the Grand Opera House in New York City, cast as Fran√ßois in the Lewis Morrison Company's production of Richelieu.Slide, Anthony. \\"Forgotten Early Directors\\", Aspects of American Film History Prior to 1920.

Dawley heeded the advice and began emphasizing and consistently using his middle name, which was his mother's maiden name, \\"Searle\\". Three years later, now billed as J. Searle Dawley, he was serving as stage manager for Morrison while still performing in several of the company's most popular presentations such as Faust, Yorick's Love, Master of Ceremonies, and Frederick the Great.Lowery, Carolyn. \\"J.

He left the Morrison Company after five years to perform on the vaudeville circuit between 1899 and 1902. He then returned to the \\"legitimate\\" theatre in New York, joining the Edna May Spooner Stock Company in Brooklyn. While working for Spooner, Dawley acted, managed the company's productions, and also demonstrated his considerable talents as a dramatist despite possessing only an eighth-grade formal education. He wrote and produced no less than 15 plays during his five years with that stock company. By 1907 he left Spooner to begin working in the rapidly expanding motion-picture industry. Despite his career move to film, he continued to write plays, including three Broadway productions, which were presented in 1907 and 1908: The Dancer and the King, The Girl and the Detective, and A Daughter of the People. Film career On May 13, 1907, Dawley began his motion-picture career in New York City. Edwin Porter, the head of production for Edison Studios, hired him that day, agreeing to pay him $60 a week ($ today) to serve as a director at the company's main film facilities, which were located in the Bronx at the corner of Decatur Avenue and Oliver Place.Slide, \\"Forgotten Early Directors\\", p. 41. Dawley's considerable stage experience proved to be very useful in managing his early screen productions. His first directorial project was the now-lost 14-minute comedy The Nine Lives of the Cat, a story about a family's troublesome pet cat that repeatedly returned home after different people attempted to abandon or kill it. Dawley's numerous frustrations working with that production's feline star and problems with the film's supporting actress prompted the director to remark later, \\"'I hardly thought I was going to like the motion picture business.'\\" Screenshot of D. W. Griffith in Dawley's production Rescued from an Eagle's Nest (1908) After experiencing some initial frustrations in his new position at Edison, Dawley quickly established himself as a reliable and prolific director for the studio. He demonstrated an ability to administer efficiently a wide range of releases for the company, often completing two or more films in a single week. Ultimately, he would direct over 200 one-reelers for Edison.\\"James Searle Dawley Papers\\", Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Beverly Hills, California.

Among the numerous \\"one-reelers\\" he created at that time were an adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1910) and presentations of two historic naval battles: The Stars and Stripes (1910), which depicted John Paul Jones' victory over HMS Serapis in 1779, and The Battle of Trafalgar (1911), a portrayal of British Admiral Lord Nelson's triumph in 1805 over a combined fleet of French and Spanish warships.\\"Fourth of July Pictures\\", The Film Index (New York, N.Y.), July 18, 1910, p. 3.

The New York-based trade journal The Nickelodeon in its February 11 issue that year introduces the four men to its readers and highlights Dawley's speciality among his fellow directors: =Travels to California= In 1910 Dawley traveled to California to establish a presence for Edison Studios on the West Coast and to assess Edison's potential for expanding its operations there like other film companies. Dawley made arrangements to rent production space in Long Beach and develop plans for possible new facilities. His initial \\"film-plant\\" activities for Edison in that location should not be confused with a \\"huge\\" $10,000,000 project being built the same year in Long Beach by Edison Power Company. That company, like Edison Studios, was a subsidiary of Edison Manufacturing Company and in 1910 began construction on the largest electrical plant west of Chicago, one that would ultimately \\"generate 100,000 horse power\\" for customers in and around Long Beach.\\"Edison Company to Erect Huge Plant at Long Beach\\", Los Angeles Times, January 4, 1910, section III, p. 1.

Despite his travels back and forth to California for his own work there between 1910 and 1912, Dawley still staged and directed most of his remaining films for Edison at its Bronx studio in New York. PLAY: Lord and the Peasant (1912) directed by Dawley for Edison Studios; running time 8:52 Dawley by 1912 increasingly spent more time writing screenplays and adapting scenarios for Edison, such as Mary Stuart, Partners for Life, and Charge of the Light Brigade. For the latter film, which he did direct and complete in California, he incorporated scenic footage he took while passing through Cheyenne, Wyoming, when he and his company of players and crew traveled from New York to California, meandering their way across the country on an \\"extensive picture making tour\\".\\"Edison Players Go West\\", The Moving Picture World (New York, N.Y.), July 27, 1912 p. 342.

How Movies Work. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1987, pp. 46-47. Edison, however, who apparently had little confidence in the attention span of moviegoers, brushed aside the experienced director's recommendation, and tersely replied, \\"'Dawley, the public won't sit through two reels.'\\"\\"Movies Were Better Than Ever to Film Pioneer's Wife: GRACE DAWLEY\\", Los Angeles Times, February 18, 1966, p.

ProQuest. =Famous Players Film Company and Dyreda= In 1913 Edwin Porter hired Dawley again, but this time to work with him for Adolph Zukor's recently established studio, Famous Players Film Company. Dawley's departure from Edison was at least partially motivated by his desire to make longer, more complex motion pictures. Working out of that Famous Players' facilities on West 26th Street in New York, he directed the first 13 releases of the new company, with his debut project being Tess of the D‚ÄôUrbervilles, which was released in September 1913.\\"J.

Dawley in 1915 became one of the 26 founding members of the Motion Picture Directors Association (MPDA), which was established in Los Angeles, California that year. Among the professional organization's expressed goals was \\"'to exert every influence to improve the moral, social and intellectual standing of all persons connected with the motion picture producing business.'\\" The following year, on November 14, a New York chapter was created for directors on the East Coast, which for a few more years would remain the center of motion picture production until California attained that status. In addition to encouraging responsible professional and personal behavior in the film community, the MPDA also pledged in its founding principles to aid any of its \\"distressed members\\" as well as \\"their wives, widows and orphans.\\" Dawley served as the second president of the New York chapter and remained an active and influential member of the association as the chairman of its board of trustees. =1916-1930s= Dawley returned to Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) in 1916, and among many other projects, he directed Marguerite Clark in a series of pictures that brought her fame in the film world second only to Mary Pickford.\\"Foreign news: 'Tough for Has'-beens'.\\" Variety (London edition), June 8, 1927, p. 2.

After his work ended as a director, Dawley tried \\"various businesses\\" during the late 1920s and 1930s that related to radio broadcasting, newspaper writing, and the development of sound-film technologies. In a seemingly odd job for a highly accomplished film director, Dawley between late July and November 1930 wrote a syndicated human-interest and romance column for The Arizona Republican newspaper in Phoenix.

It was inspired by the collaboration during the 1910s between the pure mathematicians Srinivasa Ramanujan from India, and the Cambridge University don G.H. Hardy. It was a co-production between the UK-based theatre company Complicite and Theatre Royal, Plymouth, and Ruhrfestspiele, Wiener Festwochen, and the Holland Festival. A Disappearing Number premiered in Plymouth in March 2007, toured internationally, and played at The Barbican Centre in Autumn 2007 and 2008https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2008/a-disappearing-number-review-at- barbican-theatre-london/ and at Lincoln Center in July 2010.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/theater/reviews/17disappear.html?_r=0 It was directed by Simon McBurney with music by Nitin Sawhney. The production is 110 minutes with no intermission. The piece was co-devised and written by the cast and company. The cast in order of appearance: Firdous Bamji, Saskia Reeves, David Annen, Paul Bhattacharjee, Shane Shambu, Divya Kasturi and Chetna Pandya. Plot Ramanujan first attracted Hardy's attention by writing him a letter in which he proved that :1+2+3+\\\\cdots = -\\\\frac{1}{12}\\\\ (\\\\Re) where the notation (\\\\Re) indicates a Ramanujan summation. Hardy realised that this confusing presentation of the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ‚ãØ was an application of the Riemann zeta function \\\\zeta(s) with s=-1.Marcus du Sautoy, The Music of the Primes Ramanujan's work became one of the foundations of bosonic string theory, a precursor of modern string theory. The play includes live tabla playing, which \\"morphs seductively into pure mathematics\\", as the Financial Times review put it, \\"especially when ‚Ä¶ its rhythms shade into chants of number sequences reminiscent of the libretto to Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach. One can hear the beauty of the sequences without grasping the rules that govern them.\\" The play has two strands of narrative and presents strong visual and physical theatre. It interweaves the passionate intellectual relationship between Hardy and the more intuitive Ramanujan, with the present- day story of Ruth, an English maths lecturer, and her husband, Al Cooper, a globe-trotting Indian-American businessman \\"to illuminate the beauty and the patterns ‚Äî the mystery ‚Äî of mathematics.\\"Jeff Lunden, \\"'A Disappearing Number': A Vivid Theatrical Equation\\", NPR Morning Edition, 15 July 2010 It also explores the nature and spirituality of infinity, and explores several aspects of the Indian diaspora. Ruth travels to India in Ramanujan's footsteps and eventually dies. Al follows, to get closer to her ghost. Meanwhile, 100 years previously, Ramanujan is travelling in the opposite direction, making the trip to England, where he works with Hardy on maths and contracts tuberculosis. Partition (as a maths concept) is explored, and diverging and converging series in mathematics become a metaphor for the Indian diaspora.

Jambon de Bayonne has PGI status. Production The area concerned is the basin of the river Adour and this geographical limitation is now enshrined in the regulations for the production of Bayonne ham. The meat itself does not have to come from the Adour basin but has to be produced from one of eight clearly defined breeds of pig reared in an area from Deux-S√®vres in the north to Aveyron and the Aude. The regulations are very strict and cover the zone of origin of the pork, the regime for feeding the animals (no steroids, no fish oils, no antibiotics), and each animal must be clearly and uniquely identifiable with a tattoo. Transport, slaughter, size and weight of the original meat cut, minimum fat cover, linoleic acid content, and the post slaughter storage temperature for the meat are all specified. The ham produced within these criteria is given the European Union PGI status Protected Designation of Origin (allows nitrite content) and as such is called Bayonne ham. Enforcement of these regulations and the granting of the right to use the name Bayonne ham is the responsibility of Le Consortium de Jambon du Bayonne based in Pau, the capital of Department 64 in southwest France. The drying method used in modern times mimics that used in the past. Each drying storage chamber has temperature and humidity controls set to match seasonal variations. Originally the pigs were slaughtered in late October and early November. The hams were then rubbed in salt produced in the salt pans of the Adour estuary or from those near B√©arn. The temperature conditions at this time of year, , are ideal for the initial preserving process and the hams were left hanging in the drying room until the end of January or early February. In the next part of the process, a mixture of pork fat and flour called pannage is used to seal the cut end of the joint. This reduces the speed in which the meat dries out during the warmer months of March, April, and May. At some point during this time many of the producers will also rub a paste of piment d'Espelette into the skin, giving a unique tang to the end product. The final drying stage is completed by the end of July and the ham is ready. Modern techniques using individual drying chambers with temperature and humidity controls simply reproduce the seasonal temperatures and the changing humidity conditions produced each year by the foehn (southerly wind) and the Atlantic ocean. The size of ham used is normally within the range of including bone. Once the ham has completed its curing process, it is marked with the traditional Basque cross or lauburu, topped with the name Bayonne. The ham is a minimum of 7 months old, with most being 9 or 10 months before it is offered for sale, and it will keep for up to another year if kept in a cool (8 ¬∞C), dry atmosphere. The ham is a slightly sweet, delicately flavoured meat with little salt to the taste. It is generally cut very thin and has a chewy texture in comparison to cooked hams.

He played Gaelic football with his local club Castleisland Desmonds and was a member of the Kerry senior inter-county team from 1974 until 1991. He also played soccer with Home Farm in Dublin and with the Irish amateur team. Playing career =Club= C-Bomb played his club football with his local Castleisland Desmonds club and enjoyed much success. He won a number of county club championship titles with Castleisland throughout the 1980s and 1990s. These victories allowed the club to represent the county in the provincial club championship. A 2‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of the famous St. Finbarr's club gave Nelligan a Munster club winners' medal. He later lined out in Croke Park for the All-Ireland final against St Vincents of Dublin. In one of the most dramatic endings ever a fifty-eighth-minute goal gave Castleisland a 2‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì7 victory. The win gave Nelligan an All-Ireland club winners' medal. Nelligan collected a second consecutive Munster club winners' medal in 1985 as the mighty 'Barr's' were defeated for the second consecutive year. Castleisland later qualified for another All-Ireland final. This time Burren provided the opposition and the game was another close affair. A second-half goal secured the title for Burran as Nelligan's side were defeated by 1‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì6.The GAA Book of Lists p. 420 He also played hurling with St Patrick's and won a Kerry Intermediate Hurling Championship with them in 1983. =Minor and under-21= Nelli first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the 1970s as goalkeeper on the Kerry minor football team. He won a Munster title at this level in 1975 following a 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì11 defeat pf Cork. Kerry later qualified for the All-Ireland final, with Tyrone providing the opposition. Kerry had an easy 1‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì4 win on that occasion, giving Nelligan an All- Ireland winners' medal. That same year Nelligan was also the goalkeeper on the Kerry under-21 football team. He captured a Munster title in that grade that same year following a nine-point trouncing of Waterford. Nelligan's side later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Dublin providing the opposition. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì10 score line gave Kerry the victory and gave Nelligan an All- Ireland under-21 winners' medal. In 1976 Nelligan made it two Munster under-21 titles in-a-row as Kerry retained their provincial crown at the expense of Cork. He later lined out in a second All-Ireland final. Kildare provided the oppsoution on that occasion, however, they were no match for Kerry. Nelligan collected a second All-Ireland winners' medal following a 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì3 victory. Nelligan captured a third provincial under-21 title in 1977 following a two- goal defeat of Cork. Kerry later qualified for a third consecutive All-Ireland final with Down providing the opposition. A 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì5 score line gave Kerry the victory and gave Nelligan a third All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal. In 1978 Nelligan made it four-in-a-row in Munster as Kerry retained their under-21 provincial crown at the expense of Cork again. He later lined out in a fourth consecutive All-Ireland final. Roscommon provided the opposition on that occasion, however, a close game developed. At the final whistle Kerry were defeated narrowly by 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8. =Senior= Nelligan made his senior inter-county debut with Kerry in the 1976 All-Ireland final. He came on as a substitute as both sides were hoping for success, however, new 'Dub' Kevin Moran was causing havoc with the Kerry defence. Jimmy Keaveney converted a penalty to help Dublin to a 3‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10 victory and defeat for Kerry.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 403‚Äì404 Two years later in 1978 Nelligan became the first- choice goalkeeper as Kerry faced little competition in the provincial championship once again. A defeat of Cork gave Liston a Munster winners'. Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years, with Nelligan playing in his second championship decider. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition, however, the game turned into a rout. The game is chiefly remembered for Mikey Sheehy's sensational goal. The Kerry forward lobbed the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee. Eoin Liston announced his arrival on the inter- county scene and scored a hat-trick of goals. Pat Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Nelligan was sent off. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the winners by 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9. In 1979 Kerry made it five-in- a-row in Munster as Cork fell by ten points in the provincial final. It was Nelligan's second Munster title. He later went in search of a second consecutive All-Ireland medal. Dublin provided the opposition for the fifth consecutive occasion. Kerry were handicapped throughout the game. Ger Power did not start the game, while John O'Keeffe got injured and P√°id√≠ √ì S√© was sent off during the encounter. Two goals by Mikey Sheehy and a third by John Egan helped 'the Kingdom' to a 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì8 victory. It was Nelligan's second All-Ireland winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 404‚Äì405 Kerry's dominance continued in 1980. Another defeat of Cork in the provincial final gave Nelligan a third Munster winners' medal in succession. Another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, this time with Roscommon providing the opposition. The Connacht champions shocked Kerry and took a five-point lead inside the first twelve minutes. Mikey Sheehy popped up again to score the decisive goal, as Kerry went on to claim a 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì6 victory in a game that contained sixty- four frees.The GAA Book of Lists p. 405 The victory gave Kerry and Nelligan a third All-Ireland title in succession. In 1981 Nelligan won his fourth consecutive Munster title, before lining out in the All-Ireland final against Offaly. Kerry had an easy win with seven players combining for a great goal. He captured his fourth All-Ireland winners' medal that day as Kerry won by 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì8. In 1982 Nelligan won his second National League medal before Kerry secured an eighth consecutive Munster final victory over Cork, giving him a fifth provincial winners' medal. The All-Ireland final pitted 'the Kingdom' against Offaly for the second year in-a-row. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game and were leading by two points with two minutes left to be played. The game, however, was not over as Offaly substitute S√©amus Darby, who had entered the game almost unnoticed, produced the most spectacular of finishes by scoring a late goal. Kerry failed to score again to level the match and Offaly went on to win their third All-Ireland title ever. Kerry's five-in-a-row dream was shattered.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 405‚Äì406 Kerry missed out on an historic nine-in-a-row in Munster in 1983, as Cork finally triumphed. 'The Kingdom' bounced back the following year with Nelligan winning his third National League medal and his sixth Munster title. The centenary- year All-Ireland final pitted Kerry against old rivals and reigning champions Dublin. 'The Kingdom' dominated the game from start to finish. Only two Dublin forwards scored as Kerry ran out easy winners by 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì6. It was Nelligan's fifth All-Ireland winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 406 Kerry made no mistake again in 1985. A two-goal victory over Cork gave Nelligan a seventh Munster winners' medal. Another All-Ireland final beckoned, with Dublin providing the opposition for a second consecutive year. Jack O'Shea scored a key goal after eleven minutes and Kerry stormed to a nine-point lead at half-time. 'The Dubs' came storming back with Joe McNally scoring two goals. The gap could not be bridged and Kerry won by 2‚Äì1 to 2‚Äì8. The victory gave Nelligan an impressive sixth All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1986 Kerry's dominance showed no sign of disappearing. Cork fell again in the provincial final, giving Nelligan an eighth Munster title. An eighth All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed and it turned out to be an historic occasion. Tyrone provided the opposition in their first-ever championship decider. A Peter Quinn goal gave the Ulster men a six-point lead in the second-half, however, the game was far from over. Pat Spillane ran fifty yards up the field for a hand-passed goal to get Kerry back on track. Mikey Sheehy scored a second goal to give 'the Kingdom' a 2‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì10 victory. It was Nelligan's seventh All-Ireland winners' medal. The glory days were now over for Kerry as Cork captured the next four Munster titles. Nelligan continued to play with Kerry, winning his ninth Munster title in 1991. Kerry were subsequently defeated by eventual champions Down in the All-Ireland semi-final and Nelligan decided to retire from inter-county football. =Inter-provincial= Nelligan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial football competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1979, however, Munster were defeated on that occasion. Nelligan's side lost out again in 1980, however, in 1981 he won his first Railway Cup winners' medal as Connacht were accounted for. It was the first of two title sin-a-row for Munster and for Liston. He lined out in the next three inter-provincial campaigns also, however, Munster were defeated on all three occasions.

Population: History The settlement was founded in the late 17th century by Yakuts. Its name derives from the Yakut language word Kheymchen, meaning Polynya. In the 19th century, the trade route between the Kolyma region and the Sea of Okhotsk, the Ola-Kolyma-Trakt was constructed through the settlement. Economic development of the settlement increased with the opening of the first gold mines in 1931, and the discovery and later exploitation of brown coal reserves at Elgen in 1932, tin reserves in 1937 and cobalt ore in the early 1940s. The construction of the modern settlement Seymchan began in 1940. During World War 2, an airfield was constructed to allow the delivery of aircraft through the Lend-Lease-Program between the Soviet Union and the USA. From 1949 until 1955, the sub-settlement Nizhny-Seymchan (later called Kolymskoye and abandoned in 2005), located a few kilometres to the south directly on the Kolyma, was the location of a prison camp of Dalstroy, part of the Gulag camp network. Up to 5,700 prisoners were used in the mining of gold and tin, as well as timber production.South-west labour camp, Dalstroy (German) Seymchan was granted urban-type settlement status in 1953. Economy The settlement is a regional food processing and timber industry center. =Transportation= Seymchan is connected by road with Magadan through a Kolyma Highway spur. The Seymchan Airport is located half-way between Seymchan and Kolymskoye, with a paved RWY 18/36. During World War II, the airport was used to distribute American Lend-Lease war material to production facilities within the Soviet Union. Climate Seymchan has a severe subarctic climate Dfc, closely bordering the Dfd subtype with very dry winters due to the influence of the persistent Siberian High in the months of low sun. Winters are extremely cold, although not as cold as Dfd climates such as Oymyakon, Delyankir, Verkhoyansk etc. Summers are short and mild, but sometimes very warm. Precipitation is quite low, but is somewhat higher in summer than at other times of the year. 2007 Mi-8 helicopter crash Commercial flights from Seymchan to nearby remote areas using the local forest fire protection service's Mi-8 helicopters are routine. On September 15, 2007 one such flight crashed on the Suruktash mountain while on its way to deliver paying passengers to the vicinity of the Burgali River. Six people died, and one, the craft's commander, survived with severe burns. The wreck and the survivor were spotted by another Mi-8, and the victim was flown to Seymchan for transport to a hospital.\\"Missing Mi-8 crashed in Magadan region, six die\\", ITAR-TASS News Agency, September 16, 2007.

The CRB was formed to take over responsibility from the Board of Lands and Works for the care and management of the main roads of the state. Until then there was a lack of co-operation between the agencies with operational responsibility for roads, the Roads and Bridges Branch of the Public Works Department and local municipalities, in the construction and maintenance of main roads. Expenditure of state funds was without proper supervision or a thorough investigation into actual needs. The absence of a systematic policy, as well as a lack of funds, had resulted in Victorian roads being in a deplorable condition. At this time the use of the motor car accentuated the demands for better roads. As a result of these needs the Country Roads Act 1912 (No.2415) was proclaimed in 1913 establishing the Country Roads Board as a central road authority with responsibility for those roads within the State considered to be main roads. Functions of the Board The initial functions of the Board, set out in the 1912 Act, were: * to ascertain which roads should be main roads, * to ascertain the most effective methods of road construction and maintenance, * to ascertain the deviations in existing roads or new roads which would facilitate communication and improve conditions for traffic. After an initial investigation by the Board, construction guidelines were established and the letting of construction contracts, either directly by the Board or by municipal councils, proceeded by about 1915. The responsibilities of the CRB expanded over time. Responsibility for major roads in Melbourne was shared with the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, until all road responsibilities were passed to the CRB in 1974. At various times other types of roads were proclaimed under legislation and subsequently came within the responsibility of the Country Roads Board. The Development Roads Act 1918 provided for the declaration of 'Developmental Roads', roads which would serve to develop any area of land by providing access to a railway station for primary producers. The Highways and Vehicles Act 1924 provided for the declaration of certain arterial roads as State Highways. The Tourists' Roads Act 1936 provided for the declaration of roads of sufficient interest or roads leading to tourist resorts or attractions as Tourists' Roads. The Country Roads Act 1956 enabled the Board to construct by-pass roads which became popularly known as freeways. Chairmen The first chairman of CRB was William Calder who remained in charge until his death in 1928. Another prominent chairman was Donald Victor Darwin who took over in 1949, and steered the board through a massive post-war expansion program. Successor The Country Roads Board was abolished and succeeded by the Road Construction Authority on 1 July 1983 by operation of the Transport Act 1983. This step occurred as part of a suite of major institutional changes in the Victorian transport portfolio affecting roads, trains and trams and related matters. The Road Construction Authority was later merged with the Road Traffic Authority on 1 July 1989 to form the Roads Corporation.See the Transport (Amendment) Act 1989. The Roads Corporation is still in place today and trades as VicRoads.

It was designed to promote Breton independence from France by collaboration with the occupying German forces. They drew up a proclamation of eighteen points, known as \\"Pontivy Programme\\". They also created a new journal, l'Heure Bretonne. 201 issues appeared between July 1940 and June 1944. Its first editor was Morvan Lebesque until December 1940, then Jean Merrien. Background The choice of Pontivy was not arbitrary, because it was in this town that the last congress of the Breton National Party would have been held in 1939 had it not been prohibited by the French police. Very few activists (approximately 200 including 80 released prisoners) took part in the meeting. Many militants were still held in prison camps, others, such as the painter Paul Durivaut had died in battle. A few days earlier, Mordrel and Debeauvais, joined by Marcel Guieysse and C√©lestin Lain√©, had met to form the CNB, of which Debeauvais was unanimously elected president. The post of vice- president was given to Olier Mordrel, but this post was later cancelled in a majority vote, following C√©lestin Lain√©'s proposal that it was unnecessary. These internal intrigues were explained four months later when the changes in the organization of the party led to the ousting of Mordrel. Speech Debeauvais, Guieysse and Lain√© spoke in turn after Marcel Planiol, the lawyer of the Breton National Party, had pointed out the claims to fame of each one. Mordrel proclaimed the \\"declaration of Pontivy\\", which specified that: > The Breton National Council, a body representative of Brittany, concerned > with the collective good and of the honour of their people, will act at the > hour chosen by it to create a Breton nation state, within its natural > boundaries and the spirit of its traditions, so that it could live finally > in organized nationality, free of its aspirations and mistress of its own > interests ... the international statute of the Breton State, the nature of > its relations with France and Germany would be defined by agreements, freely > discussed within the framework of the possibilities offered by the new > general conditions. Aftermath The militants dispersed at the end of the afternoon. Opponents heckled groups of the nationalists, and disrupted the proceedings by singing the Marseillaise from a distance. C√©lestin Lain√© officially took possession of the Ch√¢teau des Rohan, which he transformed into barracks to lodge the first members of his future Breton Legion (forty people).

The film was written and directed by Academy Award nominee Jonathan Hardy, who had also written Breaker Morant. Plot The plot centred on American pop singer Kate Lawrence (Branigan) wanting to embark on a career as an actress. The only job she can find is playing the lead role in an Australian theatre production of The Green Year Passes. The hiring of an American causes conflict with her Australian cast and crew, and the chagrin of theatre critic Robert Landau with whom she has an affair. Production In 1981 Frank Howson set up a company, Boulevard Films, with a view to making movies. He wanted to make a film on Les Darcy, Something Great, and collaborated with Jonathan Hardy on the script. They could not secure financing but Hardy showed Howson some other scripts he had written, including Backstage. Backstage had originally been meant to be directed in 1982 by John Lamond starring Max Phipps, Jill Perryman and Steve Tandy but the film did not eventuate. Howson and Hardy decided to work on Backstage together, with the story being relocated to the music world. Howson got Laura Branigan interested in the lead. The Burrowes Film Group needed to make another film before the end of the financial year and offered to raise the budget.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p196-197 Frank Howson original thought that the involvement of the Burrowes Film Group would be limited but found they wanted to have more creative control. \\"I knew very clearly what audience it should be made for\\", said Howson, \\"but all of a sudden I found myself dealing with production by committee. To even make the smallest decision required everyone sitting around the table.\\"Paul Kalina, \\"Boulevard Films\\", Cinema Papers, November 1989 p42-43 Matters reached an impasse when Howson and Burrowes fought over who would compose the music. Burrowes fired Howson's composer, John Capek, and replaced him with Bruce Rowlands, then Burrowes bought Boulevard out of the film. Filming started 7 March 1986. Release The film was briefly released theatrically in Australia, before being released on home video internationally. Allmovie calls it an \\"insipid and clich√©-ridden romantic comedy\\", although Variety conceded the film was \\"well crafted in every department\\". David Stratton called the film \\" neither funny nor romantic, and will do little for the careers of anyone involved in it.\\"David Stratton, \\"COMEDY OF HORRORS\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 14 April 1988 p 12 The film received bad reviews generally. Branigan also performed several songs in the film. The funding of the film was investigated in an episode of ABC's Four Corners.

Work The UCLA-educated Di Gioia was not an anthropologist by profession, but was drawn to the field by an interest in exploring the lives of ordinary people. In the early 1970s, Di Gioia and his partner David Hancock became involved in the work of filmmaker Norman Miller, upon whom the National Science Foundation had bestowed a grant to produce a film series examining global ecological zones. Di Gioia and Hancock produced several films in Afghanistan which were incorporated into the Faces of Change Collection. After the death of his partner, Di Gioia focused predominantly on teaching, training anthropologists and filmmaking students at the National Film and Television School in ethnographic filmmaking.

It is located at the confluence of the River Vistre and the River Rh√¥ny. It was an important port during the Iron Age at a time when lagoons connected to the Mediterranean Sea covered the adjoining low-lying land. History The town has a rich archaeological history, and seems to have been inhabited since at least the late 6th century BC. There have been significant finds of pottery dating back to the 4th century BC, mostly unearthed in the churchyard. A cache of 3rd-century-BC weapons has been found which included swords, shields, spears and knives, along with about thirty human skulls which showed signs that the bodies had been decapitated. Inscribed stones from the Roman era have also been found at this location and traces of stone walls that surrounded the settlement. Le Cailar is first documented as Castellus in 675. The name later evolved to Caslarium (1243) and Le Caylar (from the 15th century). In the Middle Ages, the village belonged to the viguerie of Aigues-Mortes and the Diocese of N√Æmes. The simple priory of Saint-√âtienne-du-Caylar came under the chapter of Montpellier Cathedral while in 1112 Le Cailar Castle (Ch√¢teau du Cailar) belonged to Bernard Ato IV, Viscount of N√Æmes. Saint-√âtienne du Cailar Church was built in 1091. Initially, the prosperity of the region was a result of the trade that developed in fish and salt. The monks of Saint Gilles appear to have founded the village. In 1382, the medieval castle was burnt to destruction in the feudal wars. The fiefdom was transferred to the barons of Baschy d'Aubais in the 16th century. By the time of the French Revolution, there were only a few traces of the medieval castle which nevertheless is remembered as an important item in the history of the village.\\"D√©couverte de la commune Le Cailar\\", Le Cailar.

Retrieved 9 October 2013. This area used to be a large lagoon which has gradually silted up over time. Le Cailar was an important trading centre allowing import of goods via the Mediterranean Sea and their distribution to the N√Æmes Vaunage area. The town was still considered to be a port until the early 20th century as the Vistre remained navigable this far upstream. The village today Les Ar√®nes du Cailar With its winding streets and its bullring (Ar√®nes du Cailar), Le Cailar is a typical Camargue village. It is noted for being the first village in the area (in 1851) to be associated with bull manades. The village is also receptive to modern art with Figuration Libre exhibitions encouraged by painters including Fran√ßois Boisrond.

The novel's narrator‚ÄîLouis de Rouvroy, the second Duc de Saint-Simon‚Äîwas a real-life French noble who observed life at the court and recorded in his memoirs all that he saw and felt about the reign of the Sun King. Saint-Simon (1675‚Äì1755) is mentioned in many of Auchincloss‚Äô works and in The Cat and the King he fantasizes that the Duc kept on writing after his real-life memoirs were published. Synopsis Mixing fact and fiction, the Duc de Saint-Simon recounts three episodes in which he and his wife involve themselves in the notorious schemings of King Louis XIV's Versailles. Throughout, the famous courtier's attitudes toward the King and court shift. In the first story, the young Duc, appalled at the King's calculating matches of his illegitimate offspring with prominent aristocrats, works to subvert the wedding of one of Louis' nephews, but is thwarted when his adversaries threaten to expose the homosexuality of both the King's brother and the narrator's patron, the Prince de Conti. In the second, Saint-Simon is maneuvered into acting as messenger between Conti (who is briefly King of Poland in 1697) and Conti's mistress, Madame la Duchesse. In this the Duc is subverted by his own wife's schemings. Finally, in later years, rumors of incest are deployed by both sides in a struggle to determine which of two ill-pedigreed \\"princesses\\" will be matched with one of the King's legitimate grandsons. The high-minded Saint-Simon emerges from these intrigues disillusioned (\\"We had all...been made part of the Versailles system\\"), but resolves (after the King's death) to record the monarch's \\"great style\\" and quest for glory.

His name is associated with the Scientific Prediction of Ice Conditions theory. Wiese was a member of the Soviet Arctic Institute and an authority on polar oceanography. He was also the founder of the Geographico- hydrological School of Oceanography.

Arctic expeditions In 1912‚Äì14 Wiese went with Georgy Sedov‚Äôs expedition on the ship St. Foka to Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land. After the Russian Revolution Wiese took part in a number of Soviet Arctic expeditions. In 1924 Wiese studied the drift of Georgy Brusilov's ill- fated Russian ship St. Anna when she was trapped on the pack ice of the Kara Sea. He detected an odd deviation of the path of the ship's drift caused by certain variations of the patterns of sea and ice currents. He concluded that the deviation was caused by the presence of an undiscovered island, whose coordinates he could accurately calculate thanks to the availability of the successive positions of the St. Anna during its drift. The island was later named after Wiese. Malygin in 1928 Finally the island was discovered on 13 August 1930 by a Soviet expedition led by Otto Schmidt aboard the Icebreaker Sedov under Captain Vladimir Voronin. The island was named Vize Island, who was at the time aboard the Sedov. In July 1931 Wiese led an expedition on icebreaking steamer Malygin to Franz Josef Land and the northern part of the Kara Sea. He carried out meteorological, electromagnetic and hydrological observations during this expedition. During this expedition German airship Graf Zeppelin made a rendezvous with icebreaker Malygin at Bukhta Tikhaya in Hooker Island, Franz Josef Land. At Rudolf Island Wiese recovered artifacts from the abandoned huts of the 1904‚Äì1905 Ziegler Polar Expedition to Franz Josef Land. His intention was to carry out deep-sea oceanographic research in the Arctic basin, but due to fog and bad weather he reluctantly gave up and the expedition headed south. He had also hoped to carry out oceanographic research in the then little-explored northern part of the Kara Sea, but the ice concentrations became progressively heavier until it was decided to turn back. In this Arctic expedition Wiese‚Äôs scientific zeal was tempered by Captain Chertkhov's prudent decisions. Even so, the expedition was quite successful. Surface water temperatures were taken at 295 locations, water samples were taken from 273 stations, and meteorological observations were duly taken every four hours. Earlier in 1929 Wiese proposed setting up a drifting polar observatory near the North Pole. His proposal was accepted only in 1935, resulting in the North Pole-1 expedition.–î—Ä–µ–π—Ñ—É—é—â–∏–µ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–∏. RIA Novosti. 21 May 2017 Wiese took part in its preparation, but could not participate due to declining health. He went into his final expedition in 1937, on Icebreaker Sadko. Its goal was to sail to Henrietta, Zhokhov and Jeannette Islands, in the De Long group and carry out scientific research. The purpose of the expedition was also to find out how could the Northern Sea Route be used for regular shipping. But the Soviet naval authorities changed the plans and the ice-breaker was sent instead to help ships in distress in the Kara and Laptev Seas. Sadko itself became trapped in fast ice at 75¬∞17'N and 132¬∞28'E near New Siberian Islands. Two other Soviet icebreakers that researched the ice condition in the same area, Sedov and Malygin, also became trapped by sea ice and drifted helplessly. Owing to persistent bad weather conditions, part of the stranded crew members and some of the scientists could only be rescued in April 1938. On 28 August 1938, Icebreaker Yermak freed two of the three ships at 83¬∞4'N and 138¬∞22'E. The third ship, Sedov, had to be left to drift in its icy prison and was transformed into a scientific Polar Station. It kept drifting northwards in the ice towards the Pole, very much like Fridtjof Nansen's Fram had done in 1893‚Äì96. There were 15 crew aboard, led by Captain Konstantin Badygin. During the long drift Weise and his colleagues carried out hundreds of astronomical and electromagnetic observations, and made 38 depth measurements by drilling the thick polar ice during their 812-day stay aboard the Sedov. Finally they were freed between Greenland and Svalbard by the icebreaker Joseph Stalin on 18 January 1940. The crew and scientists were welcomed back in the Soviet Union as heroes.

The story describes how a woman of mysterious powers pays visits to two very different young girls: one a princess, the other a shepherd's daughter. It has been regarded as ahead of its time in its approach to parenting.Lindskoog, Kathryn Anne; Plan for the Curing: George MacDonald and modern child-training methods, in Surprised by C.S. Lewis, George MacDonald & Dante, p82-88; Mercer University Press 2001 Synopsis Born on the same day, Rosamond, a royal princess, and Agnes, the daughter of common shepherds, are equally spoiled by their parents. Both girls grow into self-centered tyrants who make their parents miserable. A mysterious Wise Woman visits the palace and steals Rosamond, bringing her to a magical cottage deep in the forest where for the first time in her life, Rosamond learns to obey someone other than her own moods, albeit grudgingly. Using a magic mirror, the Wise Woman shows Rosamond a reflection of her Inner Self; it is so disgusting that Rosamond is terrified. Through a combination of the Wise Woman's magic, discipline, and kindness, Rosamond comes to feel ashamed of her naughtiness but is powerless to control it, having never been taught self- restraint. One day when the Wise Woman leaves her alone, Rosamond discovers a magical hidden portrait gallery. Stepping through one of the paintings, she finds herself on a hillside near Agnes's home. Just as Rosamond is escaping, the Wise Woman steals Agnes from the shepherd's croft and takes her to her cottage. All the Wise Woman's efforts to help her fail, as Agnes, while outwardly obedient, is thoroughly conceited and reprehensible; upon being shown her revolting Inner Self, Agnes resolves not to improve it, but to conceal it. Agnes, too, discovers the portrait gallery, where she is intrigued by an image of the palace. She steps through the painting and makes her way to the palace, where the King and Queen are still seeking their daughter. Agnes is put to work in the kitchens, where she attempts to curry favor by hinting that she knows where the lost princess is. Eventually word of this reaches the King and Queen, who send soldiers to bring Agnes's parents to the palace. Agnes's parents search for their missing daughter only to discover Rosamond lost in the wilderness. They tend her back to health and decide to keep her in place of Agnes. At first Rosamond genuinely attempts to be good, but she slowly slips back into her old bad habits until she is asked to leave. Rosamond longs to reunite with her parents, but becomes lost in the woods and is rescued by the Wise Woman. Rosamond now truly wishes to be a better person and begs for the Wise Woman's help. The Wise Woman subjects Rosamond to a series of magical trials, all of which she fails; however, the Wise Woman is encouraged to see that Rosamond tries all the harder with every new attempt. Looking into the magic mirror once more, Rosamond finds that her Inner Self has begun to grow beautiful, only to realize that the magic mirror is in fact the Wise Woman's eyes and that the Wise Woman has always seen how beautiful she could be. Finally the Wise Woman shows her the way home through the portrait gallery. At the palace, Agnes's parents stand accused of kidnapping the lost princess when Rosamond bursts into the courtroom to speak in their defense. Rosamond is so altered that her parents cannot see she is their daughter. The Wise Woman appears and accuses the King and Queen of being so superficial that they cannot recognize goodness when it is standing before them. She curses them to be blind until they change their ways. Rosamond volunteers to care for them until they are cured. The Wise Woman returns Agnes to her parents. Because Agnes's parents made her what she is, she is now their punishment. The shepherd begs the Wise Woman to teach him how to be a better person and parent, and the Wise Woman agrees to take him to her cottage. Before leaving with the shepherd, the Wise Woman promises Rosamond that she will always be near if Rosamond needs her.

Biography Sterne was born the youngest of five children to an Orthodox Jewish family living in the port city of Libau (now LiepƒÅja), Latvia, when it was part of the Russian Empire. After Sterne's father died, his mother moved the rest of the family to Moscow. In 1889 Sterne, his mother and sister were forced to leave Moscow, and sailed to New York City. He began his career as a draftsman and painter, and critics noted the similarity of his work, in its volume and weight, to sculpture. In the late 1890s, Sterne studied under Alfred Maurer and Thomas Eakins at the National Academy of Design, and then traveled widely in Europe and the Far East. A trip to Greece in 1908 introduced him to archaic Greek statues, inspiring him to experiment with the form himself in stone. From 1911 to 1914 he and his friend Karli Sohn-Rethel, a German painter, traveled together to India, the Far East and settled in Bali to paint and sketch, which further informed his later work. Sterne came to New Mexico in 1916 at the suggestion of his friend, Paul Burlin, and settled in Taos until 1918. His reputation was established by a show at the Scott and Fowles Gallery in 1926 and furthered by a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in 1933. In the mid-1930s, Sterne lived in San Francisco and taught at the California School of Fine Arts. He returned to the East Coast in 1945 and established a studio in Mount Kisco, New York.

The origin of this nickname is thought to lie in the Middle High German term \\"trefs\\", referring to a bramble, or similar type of plant. One possible origin takes into account that the particular plant that \\"trefs\\" referred to was nearly impossible to kill, therefore, in the context of a person, a \\"trefs\\" would be someone who was very hardy and lived a long life.

Trefzgers in Wehr  Most Trefzgers that have not yet emigrated to the US reside in the town of Wehr, Germany. In Wehr, the Trefzger family had a leading role in public life. Five Trefzgers were appointed ‚ÄòVogte‚Äô, which means the old kind of landlord-mayor under the umbrella government of a King or a Duke, and later, two Trefzgers were elected ‚ÄòBurgermeister‚Äô, or mayor: =Landlord-Mayor= *Fridlin Trefzger (1699-1707) *Josef Trefzger (1754) *Michael Trefzger (1787-1791) *Johann Baptist Trefzger (1806/08) *Anton Trefzger (till 1820) =Mayor= *Johann Baptist Trefzger (1882-1884)* *Adam Trefzger (1885-1909)  Strife in Wehr  In the beginning of the 19th century there were 19 families with the name Trefzger in Wehr. The Trefzger family was the second largest in Wehr. In 1833, the law changed for servants, from being owned by landlords to now having a chance to buy their way out and be independent. In 1834, a commission of the mayor Berger and his council members (one of them was a Trefzger) worked out a plan for this matter. There was a problem, however, with Martin Trefzger. He was a teacher, city council secretary and one of the twelve landowners who had to be paid off accordingly. He and another landlord disagreed about how much the city should pay them at this buy-out. The fight between Trefzger and the commission came finally to an end in 1840. Enkendorf, part of Wehr, tried to secede from Wehr. Enkendorf claimed to have enough citizens (90) to receive its independence from Wehr (410 citizens). Against the independence of Enkendorf was the city council of Wehr, with members like Sebastian Trefzger and Karl Berger, as lawyers, and the scriptor (secretary) of law, Martin Trefzger. Revolution in 1848 in Wehr: In 1847, the movement to create a republic in Baden began to increase dramatically. The idea started in France based on the July Revolution in 1830 against Napoleon III. The government of Baden started, therefore, in 1848, a citizen patrol to calm this political movement down. Two of the leaders of the movement were Frans Joseph Trefzger and Hecker. The radicals declared a ‚ÄòGerman Republic‚Äô on September 21, 1848. Many citizens, and finally the Prussian army troupes, fought against the radicals. So did Wolfgang Trefzger, who belonged to the mayor's council. Frans Joseph Trefzger and his movement finally gave up in May, 1849. Some political activists emigrated to Switzerland and to America.

In CSRZ the field intensity drops to zero between consecutive bits (RZ), and the field phase alternates by œÄ radians between neighbouring bits, so that if the phase of the signal is e.g. 0 in even bits (bit number 2n), the phase in odd bit slots (bit number 2n+1) will be œÄ, the phase alternation amplitude. In its standard form CSRZ is generated by a single Mach‚ÄìZehnder modulator (MZM), driven by two sinusoidal waves at half the bit rate BR, and in phase opposition. This gives rise to characteristically broad pulses (duty cycle 67%). The signal format Alternate-Phase Return-to-Zero (APRZ) can be viewed as a generalisation of CSRZ in which the phase alternation can take up any value ŒîŒ¶ (and not necessarily only œÄ) and the duty cycle is also a free parameter. CSRZ can be used to generate specific optical modulation formats, e.g. CSRZ- OOK, in which data is coded on the intensity of the signal using a binary scheme (light on=1, light off=0), or CSRZ-DPSK, in which data is coded on the differential phase of the signal, etc. CSRZ is often used to designate APRZ- OOK. The characteristic properties of an CSRZ signal are those to have a spectrum similar to that of an RZ signal, except that frequency peaks (still at a spacing of BR) are shifted by BR/2 with respect to RZ, so that no peak is present at the carrier and power is ideally zero at the carrier frequency (hence the name). Compared to standard RZ-OOK, the CSRZ-OOK is considered to be more tolerant to filtering and chromatic dispersion, thanks to its narrower spectrum.

Work Fury of Achilles Coypel was an excellent tapestry designer. He designed tapestries for the Gobelins manufactory. His most successful tapestries were created from a series illustrating Don Quixote. Coypel was the first to illustrate Don Quixote in a sophisticated manner. These illustrations were painted as cartoons for tapestries, and were engraved and published in a deluxe folio in Paris in 1724.Paulson, Ronald, 1998, Don Quixote in England: The Aesthetics of Laughter, Johns Hopkins University Press, , p.45. Coypel created twenty-eight small paintings for these tapestries over a number of years. Each of the paintings was used as the centrepiece of a larger area that was richly decorated with birds, small animals, and garlands of flowers on a patterned background. Over two hundred pieces of the Don Quixote series were woven between 1714 and 1794.Jenkins, D.T., 2003, The Cambridge History of Western Textiles, Cambridge University Press, , p.612. He received a commission to design a series of theatrical scenes for tapestries for the queen of Poland in 1747. Coypel also wrote prose, several comedies, two tragedies, and some poetry. Alongside his painting career, Coypel wrote some forty plays between 1717 and 1747. Only Les Folies de Cardenio (1720) was published. It was staged at the Tuileries Palace in 1721. In La Po√©sie et la Peinture (Allegory of painting_, allegorical comedy in three acts, the artist compared the qualities of both arts.

It provides a representation of solutions of the Dirac equation in (1+1)-dimensional spacetime as discrete sums. The model can be visualised by considering relativistic random walks on a two-dimensional spacetime checkerboard. At each discrete timestep \\\\epsilon the particle of mass m moves a distance \\\\epsilon c to the left or right (c being the speed of light). For such a discrete motion, the Feynman path integral reduces to a sum over the possible paths. Feynman demonstrated that if each \\"turn\\" (change of moving from left to right or conversely) of the space‚Äìtime path is weighted by -i \\\\epsilon mc^2/\\\\hbar (with \\\\hbar denoting the reduced Planck's constant), in the limit of infinitely small checkerboard squares the sum of all weighted paths yields a propagator that satisfies the one-dimensional Dirac equation. As a result, helicity (the one-dimensional equivalent of spin) is obtained from a simple cellular-automata-type rule. The checkerboard model is important because it connects aspects of spin and chirality with propagation in spacetime and is the only sum-over-path formulation in which quantum phase is discrete at the level of the paths, taking only values corresponding to the 4th roots of unity. History Feynman invented the model in the 1940s while developing his spacetime approach to quantum mechanics. He did not publish the result until it appeared in a text on path integrals coauthored by Albert Hibbs in the mid 1960s. Feynman and Hibbs, Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals, New York: McGraw-Hill, Problem 2-6, pp. 34‚Äì36, 1965. The model was not included with the original path-integral article because a suitable generalization to a four-dimensional spacetime had not been found. R. P. Feynman, The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum Electrodynamics, Science, 153, pp. 699‚Äì708, 1966 (Reprint of the Nobel Prize lecture). One of the first connections between the amplitudes prescribed by Feynman for the Dirac particle in 1+1 dimensions, and the standard interpretation of amplitudes in terms of the kernel, or propagator, was established by Jayant Narlikar in a detailed analysis. J. Narlikar, Path Amplitudes for Dirac particles, Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society, 36, pp. 9‚Äì32, 1972. The name \\"Feynman chessboard model\\" was coined by Gersch when he demonstrated its relationship to the one-dimensional Ising model. Gaveau et al. discovered a relationship between the model and a stochastic model of the telegraph equations due to Mark Kac through analytic continuation. Jacobson and Schulman examined the passage from the relativistic to the non-relativistic path integral. Subsequently, Ord showed that the Chessboard model was embedded in correlations in Kac's original stochastic model and so had a purely classical context, free of formal analytic continuation. In the same year, Kauffman and Noyes produced a fully discrete version related to bit-string physics, which has been developed into a general approach to discrete physics. Louis H. Kauffman, Non-Commutative Worlds ‚Äì A Summary, 2005, arXiv:quant-ph/0503198. Extensions Although Feynman did not live to publish extensions to the chessboard model, it is evident from his archived notes that he was interested in establishing a link between the 4th roots of unity (used as statistical weights in chessboard paths) and his discovery, with J. A. Wheeler, that antiparticles are equivalent to particles moving backwards in time. His notes contain several sketches of chessboard paths with added spacetime loops. The first extension of the model to explicitly contain such loops was the \\"spiral model\\", in which chessboard paths were allowed to spiral in spacetime. Unlike the chessboard case, causality had to be implemented explicitly to avoid divergences, however with this restriction the Dirac equation emerged as a continuum limit. Subsequently, the roles of zitterbewegung, antiparticles and the Dirac sea in the chessboard model have been elucidated, and the implications for the Schr√∂dinger equation considered through the non- relativistic limit. Further extensions of the original 2-dimensional spacetime model include features such as improved summation rules and generalized lattices. There has been no consensus on an optimal extension of the chessboard model to a fully four-dimensional space-time. Two distinct classes of extensions exist, those working with a fixed underlying lattice Frank D. Smith, HyperDiamond Feynman Checkerboard in 4-dimensional Spacetime, 1995, arXiv:quant-ph/9503015 and those that embed the two-dimensional case in higher dimension. The advantage of the former is that the sum-over-paths is closer to the non-relativistic case, however the simple picture of a single directionally independent speed of light is lost. In the latter extensions the fixed-speed property is maintained at the expense of variable directions at each step.

Jigsaw puzzle accessories for making, displaying and storing jigsaw puzzles. History Jigsaw puzzles were made commercially available in England by John Spilsbury, around 1760History of Jigsaw Puzzles by Daniel McAdam and have been widely accepted home entertainment in the UK ever since. Jigsaws enjoy similar popularity throughout Europe, and in the American Great Depression jigsaw puzzles sold at the rate of 10 million per week. Jigsaw Puzzles - A Brief History by Anne D. Williams It is perhaps therefore surprising that companies who produce games and puzzles have been slow to exploit the commercial opportunities afforded by so many enthusiasts who require something on which to construct their jigsaws along with methods of storing and displaying them. The first references to any kind of jigsaw puzzle accessory can be found around 1900 when a \\"Frame\\" was first included in Dutch jigsaw puzzle boxesPiece By Piece by Betsy and Geert Bekkering so that a completed puzzle could be permanently saved. The idea was not successful and was soon discontinued. A similar fate befell the mahogany and walnut \\"Puzzle Trays\\" that were advertised in Viking's Picture Puzzle Weekly in America during the 1930sLeisure in the Great Depression by Anne D. Williams In the late 1980s, Falcon Games in England decided to tackle the intellectual property issue by route of applying for a trademark and on 4 August 1989 their self-explanatory Jigroll name was registered (UK Patent Office Reference 1318441). Although many companies have since copied the functionality of the Jigroll, none have been able to give their products the same name and in jigsaw puzzle parlance \\"Jigroll\\" has almost become a generic term for all jigsaw mats and rolls. Falcon enjoyed similar success with the \\"Porta Puzzle\\" mark registered on 9 March 1993 (UK Patent Office Reference 1528876) for \\"Folders and cases made of plastics and/or card for holding and carrying jigsaw puzzles\\". Since the registration of this mark there have been a number of innovations and improvements to the original design, both by the current owners of the mark Hausemann & H√∂tte BV, Netherlands and other companies, but collectively carrying cases for jigsaw puzzles are still most often referred to as \\"Porta Puzzles\\". Jigsaw puzzle frames in which a completed puzzle can be displayed have never been very popular in either Europe or the US, but this is not the case in Japan where the customary use of jigsaws is for wall decoration. From the time that jigsaws first became available in Japan, in the 1970s,Imaginatorium Japanese Jigsaws jigsaw frames have been available to fit the jigsaw sizes of all the leading manufacturers. Modern jigsaw puzzle accessories Illustrated below are the most widely used modern products. Most of the accessories come in a range of sizes to cater for jigsaw puzzles between 500 and 2,000 pieces with the 1,000-piece size being the most popular. =Stand-alone construction tray= Construction trays are the most basic of all jigsaw puzzle accessories and they come in many different materials. Sizes required for different piece counts are as follows: 500 pieces: 520 mm x 395 mm (20.4\\" x 15.5\\") 1000 pieces: Approximately 750 mm x 520 mm (29.5\\" x 20.4\\") 1500 pieces: Approximately 915 mm x 660 mm (36.0\\" x 26.0\\") 2000 pieces: Approximately 1016 mm x 711 mm (40\\" x 28\\") The major problem with stand alone construction trays is that they cannot be packed away and stored with a part-assembled jigsaw. However, they can very easily be moved around from place to place in a home - the only functionality required by many people. =Roll-up mat= Jigroll The first accessory to obtain a trademark. Launched in 1989, the Jigroll was the forerunner of modern jigsaw puzzle accessories. The jigsaw puzzle is constructed on a green cloth that has a coarse texture to which cardboard jigsaw pieces adhere. The non assembled pieces are also kept on the cloth. When the puzzle needs to be cleared away the entire cloth is rolled around a drum thus keeping both the assembled and non-assembled pieces trapped in position until the cloth is unrolled again. =Portfolio case= Portapuzzle obtained a registered trade mark for Falcon Games approximately 4 years after their successful launch of Jigroll (see above). A portfolio case opens out to reveal a foam-backed lining. The puzzle is constructed on one side of the case and the unassembled pieces are kept either on the other side of the case or on \\"Panels\\" provided. When closed up the foam-backed lining on either side of the case exerts enough pressure to keep the jigsaw pieces in place. This invention is generally considered to be a safer way of keeping pieces in place but it involves more material and more assembly labour than a Jigroll and is consequently more expensive. =Portfolio case with separate construction tray= Jigsort Puzzles are made on a separate \\"Construction Tray\\". The outer carrying case holds a separate \\"Construction Tray\\" on which the jigsaw is made and \\"Sort Trays\\" on which the unassembled pieces are kept. The sort trays come complete with tightly fitting lids. To pack away the jigsaw the sort trays (with their lids in place) are fitted inside the construction tray and the whole is then zipped up inside the carrying case. The separate construction tray is very light and can easily be moved around and an additional benefit is the raised edge around the outside of the tray that ensures pieces do not drop off and get lost. On the downside, the extra component parts add to the retail price. =Nesting boxes for unassembled pieces= Jigsafe Up to 1,000 jigsaw puzzle pieces are neatly displayed. The loose pieces of a jigsaw take up approximately twice the space of a completed puzzle and these nesting boxes aim to solve the problem of how best to store 1,000 loose pieces in a small area. The boxes can be used for sorting different shapes or colours of piece. Each box has a removable insert so that sections of the puzzle can be constructed in the box and then easily moved to the developing jigsaw. =Jigsaw puzzle frames= Jigframe Enables puzzles to be hung on a wall. Traditionally (especially in Japan) jigsaw puzzles that are hung on a wall are glued onto a backing board. Once glued, it is a simple process to fit a puzzle into a frame in much the same way as a picture is fitted in a picture frame. However, gluing a puzzle to a board renders it unusable in the future as a puzzle. Products like the Jigframe resolve this issue with a shallow drawer incorporated into the frame that allows jigsaws to be framed without the use of glue. =Storage cases= Jigstore Puzzles can be stored in their completed state. The product comes with 10 cardboard sheets on which completed puzzles are stored. The puzzles along with their cardboard sheets are stacked on top of each other in the manner of a multi-tiered sandwich. Ultimately the entire sandwich is held together with straps that are provided and then the whole is stored in an outer cardboard case. This accessory is most suitable for dedicated enthusiasts, schools and clubs where there is a requirement to keep and display completed puzzles.

He later offended Emperor Gaozong by opposing the ascension of Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) and was exiled to be a prefect in the extreme western part of the state. In 662, he died in battle while defending his prefecture against a Western Tujue attack. His brother Lai Heng also served as a chancellor during Emperor Gaozong's reign.  Early life  Lai Ji's family was from Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). His father Lai Hu'er () was a major general during Sui Dynasty and carried the title of Duke of Rong. In 618, while Emperor Yang of Sui was at Jiangdu with the Sui state engulfed in agrarian rebellions, the general Yuwen Huaji led a coup and overthrew Emperor Yang. Yuwen executed a large number of high level officials, and Lai Hu'er, along with most of his family, was killed. Only Lai Ji and his older brother Lai Heng escaped death. It was said that Lai Ji, because his family had suffered such disaster and he had himself escaped many dangers, was particularly studious. He was said to be a good writer and good at rhetoric and analyzing situations. He did well in imperial examinations and was able to become an imperial official.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  As of 643, during the reign of Tang Dynasty's second emperor Emperor Taizong, Lai Ji was serving as a low level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). That year, Emperor Taizong's son and crown prince Li Chengqian was discovered to have plotted to overthrow Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Taizong requested opinions from his officials as to what to do with Li Chengqian. No one dared to speak up, but Lai said, \\"The best possible outcome is that Your Imperial Majesty can remain a kind father and that the Crown Prince can live out his years.\\" Emperor Taizong agreed, and he deposed Li Chengqian to commoner rank but spared Li Chengqian's life. In 644, after Emperor Taizong had created another son, Li Zhi, to be the new crown prince, he could not find an appropriate person to serve the role of brainstormer for Li Zhi, and so he commissioned Lai. Lai was also made a scholar at the imperial think tank, Chongxian Pavilion (). He was soon made a mid-level official at the legislative bureau and commissioned to edit the Book of Jin‚Äîthe official history of Jin Dynasty‚Äîwith Linhu Defen ().  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 649, Emperor Taizong died and was succeeded by Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). In 651, Lai Ji was made Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, and he became an official in charge of editing the imperial history. In 653, he was given the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), making him a chancellor de facto. In 654, he was further given the honorific title of Yinqing Guanglu Daifu () and, for his contributions in editing the histories, created the Baron of Nanyang. In 655, he was made Zhongshu Ling (), the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor, as well as the acting minister of civil service. At that time, Emperor Gaozong, who greatly favored his concubine Consort Wu, was considering deposing his wife Empress Wang and replacing her with Consort Wu. He first considered creating Consort Wu the unprecedented title of Chenfei (), but Lai and fellow chancellor Han Yuan opposed the move on the basis that the title was unprecedented, so Emperor Gaozong relented. However, in 655, he, over the explicit opposition of Lai, Han, and the highly regarded chancellor Chu Suiliang, as well as the implicit disapproval by his own powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji, deposed Empress Wang and replaced her with Consort Wu. After Empress Wu's ascension, she submitted a petition ostensibly praising the faithfulness of Han and Lai in opposing the unprecedented Chenfei title, but showing instead that she remembered that they had offended her. In 656, after Empress Wu's son Li Hong was created crown prince (displacing Emperor Gaozong's oldest son Li Zhong, whose mother Consort Liu was of low birth), Lai was made a junior advisor to the young crown prince, and his title was upgraded to that of a marquess. In 657, however, with Empress Wu and her allies Xu Jingzong and Li Yifu beginning to carry out a series of reprisals against officials who had opposed Empress Wu's ascension, Xu and Li falsely accused Han and Lai of encouraging Chu (who by that point had been demoted to the post of commandant at Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi)) to rebel. Emperor Gaozong demoted both Han and Lai to be prefects of distant prefectures‚Äîin Lai's case, the prefect of Tai Prefecture (Âè∞Â∑û, roughly modern Taizhou, Zhejiang) -- and ordered that they be permanently barred from returning to the capital Chang'an. However, he was able to escape further reprisals in 659, when by Empress Wu's instigations Zhangsun was forced to commit suicide and Empress Wang's uncle Liu Shi was executed. (Han would have suffered the same fate as Liu, but he already died before the executioners arrived.) In 660, though, Lai's post was moved to the even more distant Ting Prefecture (Â∫≠Â∑û, roughly modern Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang), on the borders with Western Tujue. In 661, Western Tujue forces attacked Ting Prefecture. Lai gathered his forces to resist, and he told his subordinates, \\"I should have been executed a long time ago, and it is fortunate that I was spared. This is the time that I should sacrifice my body for the empire.\\" He therefore engaged Western Tujue forces without wearing armor, and he was killed in battle. He was posthumously honored, and his casket was returned to his home territory to be buried.

On 16 September 2007, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki announced the party formation and said that he would run as its presidential candidate in the December 2007 Kenyan elections. It has since become a political party in its own right following conditions set by the Political Parties Act, passed in Kenya in 2008. Overview The PNU started out as a coalition of several parties, including the KANU, Narc-Kenya, Ford-Kenya, Ford-People, Democratic Party, Shirikisho, National Alliance Party of Kenya and others. President Mwai Kibaki was to be the only personal member of PNU besides the corporate membership through the affiliated parties.PNU-homepage, seen on 3-01-2008 PNU was created shortly before the elections that were held in December 2007. Until the beginning of September it was not clear on which party's ticket the president was going to run. In the 2002 elections, Kibaki ran as the candidate of the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), which had since split. The erstwhile original NARC was legally in the hands of its chairperson Charity Ngilu who showed no inclination of siding with Kibaki for a renewed bid. Kibakis allies had already pulled out of NARC and founded NARC-Kenya which was not on good terms with a number of important politicians in Kibaki's government of National Unity which had seen the intake of erstwhile opposition figures since 2005 who held on to their parties like KANU or Ford-Kenya. 2007 Elections Poor political preparation of the new party became obvious in the process of nomination for parliamentary seats. Initially, PNU member parties agreed to field parliamentary and civic candidates under PNU, except KANU, which was permitted to field its own candidates.The Standard, 11 October 2007: PNU agrees on joint nominations However, this agreement failed to materialise. As a result, some candidates -mainly from Kibaki's former Democratic Party- contested under PNU ticket and others under their respective parties. In a number of constituencies PNU-affiliated candidates were contesting against each other for the same parliamentary seat.Daily Nation, 19 November 2007: PNU parties flout election deal PNU fared poorly in the parliamentary elections 2007 reaching only 43 seats against nearly 99 for its main rival, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Together with affiliated parties, however, it could command around 78 members of parliament. On 28 February 2008 through a mediation team headed by former UN General Secretary Kofi Annan, the PNU government reached a deal with the ODM to share power. ODM is headed by Raila Odinga. The power sharing deal was the first one of its kind in Africa. 2008 Onwards After the 2007 elections, PNU was registered as a political party in its own right, George Saitoti served as chairman, till his death in 2012, while Mwai Kibaki was party leader until his retirement from politics, much to the dismay of several of its coalition partners.Kibaki endorsed as PNU leader Written By:PPS/Collins Anampiu , Posted: Fri, 19 December 2008 http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=54580Published on 28 October 2008 By Joseph MurimiEast African Standard http://www.eastandard.net/politics/InsidePage.php?id=1143997999&cid;=289&PNU;‚Äôs crucial test for Registrar of parties In October 2012, the party's National Executive Committee entered a tentative election pact with TNA, where it would surrender the right to field individual candidates in the 2013 in exchange for supporting Uhuru Kenyatta's presidential bid.PNU and TNA to Sign Poll Pact http://allafrica.com/stories/201210110152.html This marked the beginning of the end of the party, as without any candidates in any office in Kenyan politics, lack of funds and multiple overdue debts, the party was de- registered in October 2014.http://mobile.nation.co.ke/news/End-of-road-for- Kibaki-PNU-party/-/1950946/2490412/-/format/xhtml/-/vrxu47/-/index.html End of Road for Kibaki PNU Party Structures When founded, in 2007, the party membership consisted of Mwai Kibaki as the sole individual member, with all other parties within the coalition having corporate membership.

It is episodic and follows two workers in their 50s, Zhao (Zhao Benshan) and Liu (Hong Qiwen). The film opens when Liu unexpectedly dies after a night of drinking and Zhao decides to fulfill a promise to his friend to get him home, beginning a long odyssey from Shenzhen to Chongqing with Liu's corpse on his back. Along the way, Zhao meets a variety of figures, played by several of China's better known character actors. Getting Home is Zhang Yang's fifth feature film. It was produced by Filmko Entertainment of Hong Kong and the Beijing Jinqianshengshi Culture Media company of the People's Republic of China. International sales and distribution was by Fortissimo Films out of Amsterdam. Getting Home's original title derives from a Chinese proverb meaning \\"A falling leaf returns to its roots.\\" It is apparently based on a true story.) Cast *Zhao Benshan as Zhao a middle-age worker who decides to carry his deceased friend home *Hong Qiwen as Liu *Song Dandan as a middle-age homeless woman who sells her blood for money *Guo Degang as a ringleader of a gang of thieves who attempts to hold up the bus Zhao first uses to transport Liu's corpse *Hu Jun as a trucker who drives Zhao and Liu a part of the way *Xia Yu as a cyclist attempting to bicycle to Tibet *Wu Ma as an elderly, wealthy, lonely man who Zhao meets along his journey *Liu Jinshan as a thuggish restaurateur *Chen Ying and Guo Tao as husband and wife beekeepers who have rejected modern society Production Originally titled Air, Getting Home was financed by Filmko Films and Fortissimo Films and produced by Peter Loehr (of Ming Productions and the Imar Film Company) and Wouter Barendrecht of Fortissimo. This marked the first collaboration between Zhang and Filmko but the fifth with Fortissimo. Though the film documents Zhao's journey from Shenzhen to Chongqing, the majority of shooting took place in Yunnan, a Chinese province in the southwest. Reception Getting Home had its Western debut in the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival on 11 February 2007, as part of the festival's Panorama series. There it won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Since Berlin, Getting Home has made the rounds in the festival circuit, including Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival, Deauville and the New York Asian Film Festival. Western critics, meanwhile, have embraced the film, with several noting that, while the synopsis recalls the American comedy Weekend at Bernie's, Getting Home far surpasses that film in plot, cast, and drama. One critic notes that the film is \\"a perfectly pitched and quite heartwarming drama about friendship and promises, with a welcome drop of dark humour.\\" Several magazines, including Variety and that's Beijing praised the performance of Zhao Benshan in particular as \\"finely calibrated\\" and \\"vivid\\" respectively.

From 1931 until 2000, and again from 2004 until 2009 they were members of the Football League, playing in the third or fourth tiers of English football. The club persistently had one of the poorest playing records of any Football League sides, and was re-elected to the League on no fewer than seven occasions. From the early 1980s onwards, the club was plagued with financial troubles, selling their Sealand Road ground in 1990 to clear debts and spending two seasons playing at Macclesfield before returning to the city to play at the new Deva Stadium. Following their second relegation from the Football League to the Football Conference in 2009, these troubles came to a head, and the club was wound up by HMRC in March 2010. Non-league football (1885‚Äì1931) =Formation and early years= Chester City F.C. were founded in August 1885 as an amalgamation of Chester Rovers and Old King's Scholars and initially played their home games at Faulkner Street in the Hoole area of Chester. Chester's first recorded game was a friendly defeat against Earlestown on 12 September 1885, with their first home match a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Northwich Victoria. In 1886, Arthur Turner became Chester's first professional player when the club bought him out of the Army for ¬£25. Prior to 1888, there were no football leagues in England, and Chester's matches consisted of friendlies, the Cheshire Senior Cup, which they reached the final of for the first time in 1887/88 (losing 9‚Äì0 to Crewe Alexandra), and the Welsh Cup. In 1886/87, Chester entered the FA Cup for the first time, but was disqualified after the second round victory against Goldenhill due to fielding an ineligible player. In 1889/90 Chester reached the last 32 of the competition where the club was eliminated by Lincoln City. In 1890/91 Chester joined the Combination League, and put in a strong performance in their first season, finishing third, while reaching the last 16 of the FA Cup, where they were eliminated by the eventual winners Blackburn Rovers. The next few years saw Chester as a mid-table Combination side, although by now success in the FA Cup proved more elusive, with five first qualifying round exits in six years. At the end of the 1897‚Äì98 season Chester were forced to leave Faulkner Street due to buildings encroaching on the ground, and moved to land which had previously been used for the Royal Agricultural Show in 1893. Unfortunately, the stand at the Old Showground ground blew down three times in a matter of months, and the club did not have any security of tenure, leaving Chester looking for a new ground for the 1899‚Äì00 season. The search proved fruitless, and the club disbanded for the next two seasons. For 1901‚Äì02, however, Chester secured a ground at Whipcord Lane, and returned to the Combination. However, this ground was also to prove problematic: in the first round of the FA Cup, Chester were ejected after beating Birkenhead 5‚Äì4 in a replay, due to the pitch being too short to meet FA Cup requirements. Chester did not play again in the FA Cup until the 1905/6 season. In the Combination, after finishing bottom on their first season back, Chester improved considerably, and managed the feat of being runner-up for five seasons in succession between 1903‚Äì04 and 1907‚Äì08 to four different teams. At the same time, in December of the 1906‚Äì07 season Chester moved to a new stadium on Sealand Road, which had considerably more space than Whipcord Lane, and on Good Friday 1907 Chester set a new attendance record of 6,670. Also in 1907‚Äì08, Chester won the Welsh Cup for the first time, beating Connah's Quay 3‚Äì1. In 1908/9 Chester finally made the breakthrough of winning the Combination, losing only two games out of 30 in the season, and finishing eight points ahead of second placed Saltney. They also returned to the Welsh Cup final, although on this occasion they lost the final 1‚Äì0 to Wrexham. The 1909‚Äì10 season was less successful in league competition, with Chester finishing third, although they once again returned to the Welsh Cup final, where there were again beaten by Wrexham, this time 2‚Äì1. For a number of years, Chester had been applying unsuccessfully to move to a league which offered a stronger standard of football, but in the summer of 1910, they were finally successful, and switched to the second division of the Lancashire Combination, with the reserve side remaining in the Combination. The switch proved a beneficial one, as Chester were promoted in their first season after finishing third. The next three seasons saw Chester as a mid-table side within the first division of the Lancashire Combination, with the club reaching the semi-finals of the Welsh Cup in both 1911‚Äì12 and 1912‚Äì13. However, following the outbreak of World War 1 attendances dropped considerably, and although the Lancashire Combination played out the season, Chester withdrew from the league in March, and their record was expunged. =The Cheshire County League= After World War I, they became founder members of the Cheshire County League, which was substantially founded from clubs which had been part of the Lancashire Combination, including Witton Albion, Macclesfield, Northwich and Altrincham, providing Chester with more local derbies than previously. Over the next decade, Chester were consistently one of the strongest sides in the league, finishing as champions in 1921‚Äì22, 1925‚Äì26, and 1926‚Äì27. However, attendances were poor and the club's financial position was precarious, meaning that the Directors took the decision to seek election to the Football League. Chester's first attempt to seek election was in 1928, when Chester failed to be elected, finishing bottom of the election voting with only two votes. In 1929, Chester gain failed to obtain election, and on this occasion failed to receive even a single vote. The decision was made to focus attention solely on obtaining election to the League, and in order to help with this Charlie Hewitt was appointed manager in 1930, bringing with him a strong record as manager of Connah's Quay including Welsh Cup and Welsh National League titles. The appointment, and the players whom Hewitt brought in, was an immediate success, with 170 goals scored in 42 league fixtures, with forward Arthur Gale netting 102 times in all competitions. In advance of the election for Football League membership, the Directors personally visited all First and Second Division clubs to canvass support. In the event, in the first round of voting Chester were tied, on 27 votes each, with Nelson, therefore requiring a second vote to break the tie. Chester received 28 votes to Nelson's 20 votes in this second round, and became members of the Football League. The Football League (1931‚Äì2000) =Into the league= After a summer of excitement, Chester played their first Football League match against Wigan Borough in Division Three North on 29 August 1931 at Sealand Road in front of a gate of 12,770. Chester won 4‚Äì0 but the result was to be declared void after Borough resigned mid-season from the league. Therefore, the first Chester Football League result to stand was a 1‚Äì1 draw at neighbours Wrexham four days later. Chester quickly adapted to the League and finished an impressive third in the table, led by Tommy Jennings scoring 30 goals in 39 league matches. The 1932/3 season was also a strong one for the club, with a series of strong attendances, highlighted by the 16,835 who saw Chester play Wrexham, and a fourth-place finish in the League. The club also performed well in the FA Cup, beating second division Fulham 5‚Äì0 in the third round, with Foster Hedley netting four times, before bowing out 3‚Äì2 at Halifax in a fourth round replay. And in the Welsh Cup Chester triumphed for the second time, beating rivals Wrexham 2‚Äì0 at Sealand Road. The 1933‚Äì34 season was the first since entering the League where Chester did not challenge for promotion, slipping to tenth in the table; indeed, the team needed to win eight of their last ten fixtures to finish that high, having been fifth from bottom after the 9‚Äì0 defeat at Barrow on 10 February. The turnaround was sparked by the club making three signings on 15 March, of Arthur Wilson, Charlie Sargeant and John Wallbanks, a striker who scored 12 goals in the last ten matches. Led by the goals of Wallbanks, Chester's good form continued into the 1934‚Äì35 season, and the club lay top of the table at the start of April. However, following the transfer of Wallbanks to Bradford PA, one win in the last six matches was not enough to maintain the lead, and Chester finished the season in third place, missing out on promotion. 1935‚Äì36 saw Chester's highest ever league position, as the club finished second in Division 3 North behind Chesterfield, although this was at the time not sufficient for promotion. The team scored 100 times over the league campaign, including an astonishing 12‚Äì0 home victory over York City at the start of February. In cup competitions, the team also performed strongly, reaching the Welsh Cup final before going down 2‚Äì0 to Crewe Alexandra, and winning the Division 3 North Cup. The Blues' consistent run of strong league positions continued in 1936‚Äì37 with a third- place finish, with the team also retaining the Division 3 North Cup. By their high recent standards, the 1937‚Äì38 season was something of a disappointment for Chester. They regressed in the League to ninth place, despite registering heavy wins of 7‚Äì2 against Port Vale and 6‚Äì0 against Hartlepool United during the season. Cup competitions also represented a relative failure, with their sole FA Cup tie being a third round exit against Leeds United, and an early exit to Shrewsbury Town in the Welsh Cup. 1938‚Äì39 saw something of a resurgence, however, with the club ending the season in sixth place, and a long FA Cup run culminating in a fourth round exit to Sheffield Wednesday after two replays. Chester started the 1939‚Äì40 season strongly, winning two and drawing one of the three matches played before the outbreak of World War 2. Following the commencement of hostilities, the regular league programme was cancelled, and replaced by wartime football. =The War Years= During the war time Chester continued to play in a regionalised war league, which mixed teams from a variety of levels- Chester played in the same division as teams ranging from New Brighton to Liverpool. With many men away on active service, attendances dipped sharply, with the 1940‚Äì41 season seeing Chester draw only 300 for the home game against Burnley. The leagues also featured an irregular number of games, with Chester playing Wrexham four times in 1940‚Äì41, and no fewer than six times in 1942‚Äì43. In the main, Chester's results in the war league were inauspicious, with the club's best season being 1944‚Äì45 when it was 19th out of 54 teams in the (first) League North. =Post-war decline= Chester started the 1946‚Äì47 season with a very different squad to that which had been so successful before the war. The season brought a third-place finish and another Welsh Cup triumph, but grim times lay ahead. No top half placings would be achieved until the lower divisions were merged in 1958, when Chester were placed in Division Four. They would still have to wait another six years until they finished above halfway in a league table. =Moving up= Chester's fortunes began to take a turn for the better after the surprise appointment of South African Peter Hauser as manager in 1963. He was to provide an entertaining period for the club, as they challenged for promotion from Division Four. The most memorable campaign was 1964‚Äì65, when all five forwards managed 20 goals (a unique achievement) as Chester managed 119 in Football League games alone. However, the club missed the promotion boat, and the following season saw them slip from a near-certain elevation after failing to recover from the broken legs suffered by full-backs Bryn Jones and Ray Jones in the 1 January win over Aldershot. Apart from missing out on promotion by just a point in 1970‚Äì71 the next few years were largely disappointing. Chester kicked off the 1974‚Äì75 season as the only Football League team to have never won promotion ‚Äî they finally broke their duck by finishing fourth in Division Four and pipping Lincoln City to promotion by the narrowest of goal averages. Ken Roberts had the honour of being the first Chester manager to win promotion in the Football League, although much credit went to inspirational coach Brian Green. That season was perhaps more remembered though for Chester's incredible run to the League Cup semi-finals. After beating Walsall, Blackpool and Bobby Charlton's Preston North End, Chester hosted Football League champions Leeds United in round four. On an incredible night, two goals from John James and one from Trevor Storton gave Chester a 3‚Äì0 win that is regarded as one of the greatest shocks in the competition's history. The magic continued in the next round, when Newcastle United were defeated in a home replay to set up a semi‚Äìfinal tie with Aston Villa. Chester once again performed admirably but suffered heartache, as Brian Little's late goal in the second leg at Villa Park sealed a 5‚Äì4 win for eventual cup winners Villa. =The success continues= Chester began to consolidate their position in the Third Division and enjoyed runs to the FA Cup fifth round in both 1976‚Äì77 and 1979‚Äì80 under Alan Oakes. They achieved their best position since the lower divisions were re-organised in the late 1950s by finishing fifth in 1978, missing out on promotion (in the pre play-off era) by just two points. Chester were also one of just two sides to win the short-lived Debenhams Cup, a competition competed for by the two sides from outside the top two divisions to go farthest in the FA Cup. They beat Port Vale 4‚Äì3 on aggregate in 1977 to win their first English national trophy. Chester also continued their giantkilling exploits by knocking First Division Coventry City out of the League Cup in 1978‚Äì79 and Second Division leaders Newcastle United from the FA Cup a year later. The period also saw the emergence of the club's most famous player and record sale, Ian Rush, from the club's youth set-up. Rush, a Welsh born striker, made his debut for Chester in April 1979 and was a regular player in the team the following season, scoring 18 goals before being sold to Liverpool for ¬£300,000 at the season's end. =The yo-yo period= After Rush departed in 1980, the goals dried up for Chester and they were back in the basement by 1982. Two years later they finished bottom of the entire Football League but were comfortably re-elected. By this point the club was known as Chester City, having added the suffix for the 1983-84 season. Thanks to the signing of Stuart Rimmer, and astute management of Harry McNally, Chester returned to the Third Division in 1986 as runners-up in the Fourth Division. Three years later they narrowly missed out on a play-off spot as McNally worked miracles on a limited budget, but further bad times lay ahead. In 1990, Chester were moved out of their Sealand Road home and temporarily shared Macclesfield's Moss Rose ground. Despite regularly attracting tiny crowds, Chester defied the odds to avoid relegation from the Third Division in both 1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92. They returned to the city as occupants of the new Deva Stadium in 1992 - the same year that the old Third Division was renamed Division Two after the creation of the FA Premier League. During these years, Chester had some high-profile league opposition more familiar with the First Division than the Third and Fourth Divisions. These included Bolton Wanderers (four times FA Cup winners), Burnley (league champions as recently as 1960), West Bromwich Albion (who had rarely been away from the First Division for nearly a century until 1986) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (one of the most successful teams in English football as recently as the early 1980s). Chester suffered a landslide relegation in their first season at the Deva Stadium, before winning promotion straight back as Division Three runners-up. Unfortunately, the shock resignation of manager Graham Barrow and the departure of several key players in the close-season of 1994 left Chester with a threadbare squad, and they were comfortably relegated back to Division Three in 1995. They would stay there for five years. The Chester stadium is notable for straddling the England-Wales border: while the pitch is in Wales, the main stand and offices are in England. Amid crippling financial problems under owner Mark Guterman, Chester entered administration in October 1998. Despite their off-field problems, Chester comfortably avoided relegation from the Third Division under Kevin Ratcliffe in 1998‚Äì99 and their appeared to be fresh hope when Terry Smith became new owner in July 1999. Unfortunately, American Smith (whose background lay in American football) was to oversee a disastrous period for the club. He became manager after Ratcliffe resigned in August 1999 and managed just four league wins in as many months in charge. Despite improved showings under new boss Ian Atkins, Chester lost their 69-year-long Football League status on 6 May 2000 after losing to Peterborough United. Non-league football and financial problems (2000‚Äì2008) =The Football Conference= After relegation from the League, Mark Atkins left the club, replaced by popular former manager Graham Barrow, while Luke Beckett moved to Chesterfield for a fee finally set by a tribunal at ¬£175,000. In the league, the first season in the Conference petered out into an eighth-place finish, with Chester earning 62 points from their 42 matches during a campaign where Rushden & Diamonds mostly looked uncatchable as leaders. The highlights of the season came in the cup competitions. In the FA Cup, Chester won through to the Third Round, where they lost 2‚Äì0 at Division One promotion challengers Blackburn Rovers, having knocked out Football League opposition in both the First and Second Rounds. In the FA Trophy, Chester beat Doncaster, St Albans, Blyth Spartans and Southport to reach the semi-final. However, in two sub-par displays Chester lost 2‚Äì0 in both legs of the tie against lower division opposition, in the shape of Canvey Island. More off-season problems marred the summer of 2001. In May, Terry Smith sacked Paul Beesley, Carl Ruffer and Wayne Brown - the top three players in player of the year voting - and provoked what was described as a \\"playing squad united in open revolt\\" by attempting to arrange a post-season fitness training camp.May 2001 News www.chestercity.co.uk Retrieved 3 May 2012 Only a week after the sackings, Beesley, Ruffer and Brown were all reinstated ahead of a tribunal hearing over their alleged unfair dismissal; but the same day, the FA placed Chester under a transfer embargo for non-payment of the transfer fee for Tony Hemmings. At the start of June, club physio Joe Hinnigan was told he must re-apply for his job, and resigned. On 20 June, manager Graham Barrow was fired by Terry Smith in a phone conversation, and replaced by former Manchester United player Gordon Hill; in the meantime Paul Beesley was sacked for the second time in as many months.June 2001 News www.chestercity.co.uk Retrieved 3 May 2012 By the end of June, fans were picketing the Deva Stadium in order to force Smith's departure as Chairman. With this background, the 2001‚Äì02 season began under a cloud. Only 745 fans turned up to see Chester lose their opener 2‚Äì0 at home to Woking, and the eight league matches in September passed without any wins. However, at the start of October Smith sold his controlling stake in Chester City to former Barrow owner Stephen Vaughan. Only one match into Vaughan's ownership - a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Margate which left Chester bottom of the table - manager Gordon Hill was fired, to be replaced by caretaker manager Steve Mungall. However, Mungall himself lasted only 79 days, being fired after a Boxing Day defeat to Northwich Victoria once again left Chester bottom of the Conference. The next managerial appointment was to prove more long-lasting and successful, as Mark Wright took over the reins. Good form in the second half of the season under Wright both saw Chester reach the Sixth Round of the FA Trophy, and climb to 14th place in the final table and comfortably avoiding relegation to the Northern Premier League. With a summer free of squad unrest and financial troubles, Chester started the 2002‚Äì03 season strongly. The defence was solid from the outset of the season, and the signing of Darryl Clare for ¬£95,000 strengthened the strikeforce. By the turn of the year, Chester were in third place in the table. Their form was steady throughout the season, although it required two goals in the last three minutes in the penultimate game against Woking to secure a play-off spot. In the playoff semi-final against Doncaster Rovers, both legs were drawn 1-1, and the tie went to a penalty shoot-out, which saw Chester lose by a single penalty. Chester's 2003‚Äì04 season saw them achieve their first league title since contesting wartime competitions some 60 years earlier. Chester's form was strong throughout the campaign, led by 29 goal striker Daryl Clare and 20 goal Darryn Stamp. The team was particularly strong over the crucial Christmas period, with the Blues scoring 16 goals across a three match spell. For much of the season, the lead in the table switched between Chester and Hereford United, but the title was finally secured with a 1‚Äì0 win at the Deva Stadium against Scarborough. Mark Wright was voted Conference Manager of the Year, while Daryl Clare picked up the Golden Boot. =Difficult return= After an unbeaten pre-season campaign, Chester were tipped to win a second successive promotion in 2004‚Äì05, but their season was to be a bitter disappointment. Mark Wright resigned the day before the season started, with Ray Mathias rapidly appointed to be in caretaker charge for Chester's 1‚Äì1 draw at Notts County. The season was further sabotaged when Darryn Stamp and Darryl Clare, who had scored 49 goals between them in the previous season, both suffered injuries and made only 11 appearances between them before both being transferred out. By the end of August, Chester were bottom of the League but their fortunes improved under new manager, and ex-player, Ian Rush, who received his first managerial appointment. However, player departures continued, most notably Danny Collins who was sold to Sunderland for ¬£140,000, and Kevin Ellison who was sold to Hull City for ¬£100,000. Although Rush helped steer City to safety, goals were rare, including a run of five league games without a goal. At the start of April, Rush resigned, citing the dismissal without his consent of Assistant Manager Mark Aizlewood as the reason. For the second time in a single season, Chester appointed a caretaker manager, this time David Bell. A replacement full-time manager, in the shape of Keith Curle was appointed for the last match of the season. At the end of the campaign, Chester finished with 52 points from their 46 games, in twentieth position. Over the summer of 2005, Chester's squad was substantially rebuilt by Curle, including the ¬£100,000 purchase of Gregg Blundell from Doncaster Rovers. However, Chester's financial difficulties once again reared their head, with the Inland Revenue filing a petition to wind up the club over a ¬£180,000 debt, which was settled in September. However, on the pitch the season started successfully, with Chester sitting in fourth place at the start of December. However, Chester's form then collapsed, with fifteen losses in seventeen matches from 10 December onwards. Curle was fired in late February. In a surprising turn of events, Mark Wright returned to the club which he had resigned from less than two years previously, and a run of five successive wins late in the season secured another campaign in the Football League. At the end of the season, Chester once again amassed a total of 52 points, finishing 15th. Ryan Lowe top scored, with only ten goals. The 2006‚Äì07 season was largely forgettable. Form was mediocre throughout the year as Chester finished with 53 points, in 18th place. It was a season of relative managerial stability, with Wright lasting until two games before the end of the season. The highlight was a bizarre FA Cup run, where Chester were knocked out in the second round by Bury, but subsequently reinstated due to Bury having fielded an ineligible player. Chester then went out to be knocked out again by Ipswich Town in the third round. The reinstatement was particularly fortunate for Chester player Jon Walters who was purchased by Ipswich a week after the game, for a fee set by a tribunal at ¬£100,000. For the 2007‚Äì08 season, Bobby Williamson was appointed as first team manager. The summer saw the return of several ex-Chester players, including Kevin Ellison and John Murphy. Once again the start of the season saw strong form, with Chester finishing October in second place and looking well placed to achieve third tier status for the first time in more than a decade. However, as two seasons previously, Chester's form collapsed, with only two wins in the last 26 matches of the season. Williamson was fired at the end of February, and replaced by Simon Davies, initially as caretaker but subsequently as permanent manager. Chester finished the season in 22nd place, only one spot above the relegation zone, on just 47 points from the 46 matches. The death of Chester City (2008‚Äì10) The 2008‚Äì09 season was to prove to be Chester City's last in the Football League. Chester began the season with a squad of only 22 players, including youth team players given professional contracts just prior to the season. However, at the start of the campaign it appeared implausible that City could go down, as Rotherham United and AFC Bournemouth had both been deducted 17 points for rules violations before the start of the season, and Luton Town faced a 30-point penalty. Luton were, almost inevitably, relegated in second place, but Rotherham and Bournemouth managed to avoid the second relegation place which had been widely tipped as the final position for either one of these teams. The season began in disastrous style for the Blues, with a 6‚Äì0 defeat at Dagenham, and five goals conceded in the first 35 minutes of the League Cup tie against Leeds United. Crowds fell sharply, with only 1301 watching the home game against Brentford. The club was also subject to a transfer embargo from October onwards for non-payment of player wages, which restricted the ability of the club to improve its fortunes. Simon Davies was fired in mid-November, with the team struggling in 19th place. He was replaced by Mark Wright, returning for his third spell as manager. Two weeks after Wright's appointment, Stephen Vaughan put the club up for sale. After the turn of the year, Chester's form declined significantly, with only two wins out of the last 22 matches of the season. This coincided with a series of players leaving the club, including Mark Hughes and Paul Butler further depleting the already limited squad. The club was also rocked by further scandal when David Mannix and Jay Harris were charged by the FA for breaching betting rules. The severe recession of this era did Chester no favours era, having a similar detrimental effect on attendances and finances as Chester's declining form did. At the conclusion of the season, Chester finished with a mere 37 points, in 23rd place. The Blues had the worst defence in the division, having conceded 81 goals, and the second worst goalscoring record. The club were once more relegated to the Football Conference. On 14 May 2009, Chester's financial problems continued with the club's entry into voluntary administration. In June the club's administrators revealed that Chester City owed ¬£7m to its creditors, including ¬£4m to owner Stephen Vaughan and over ¬£900,000 to HMRC. However, Vaughan bought the club under a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), for a payment of 15p in the pound. With Chester subject to a transfer embargo until the club came out of administration, there was an exodus of players from the club. In addition, Mark Wright left the club for a third time on 22 June, to be replaced by Mick Wadsworth. Furthermore, on 17 July the FA introduced an embargo on Chester playing any pre-season friendlies due to concerns about the transfer of ownership of the club. The club's problems deepened further on 28 July when the CVA was overturned after an appeal by HMRC, when it was revealed that the former club's debts included a ¬£11,000 per week cleaning bill.Chester City - The Tax Man Bites Back Twohundredpercent - Retrieved 2 May 2010 Following the overturning of the CVA, there was a dispute between the FA and the Football Conference as to whether Chester City should be permitted to start the season.

Mick Wadsworth was sacked as first team manager at the end of September, after only 13 matches in charge. Jim Harvey was appointed as Chester manager to replace Wadsworth, and led to an upturn in fortunes, with the club having earned 21 points following the 3‚Äì1 win over Grays at the start of November, to stand on a net -4 points. However, by this point Chester's off-pitch troubles had re-emerged.

The club's financial problems continued to mount, and a prohibition order was issued on the Deva Stadium after police withdrew their services after the non-payment of bills. On 9 February, Chester were scheduled to have an away fixture at Forest Green Rovers, but the club's coach providers refused to depart from Chester until they were paid in advance. The match was postponed less than three hours before kick-off. On 11 February the Football Conference suspended Chester for non-fulfilment of fixtures; and on 26 February the other Football Conference clubs voted to expel Chester, in a meeting that Chester did not send anyone to attend. This expulsion took effect on 8 March, after Chester failed to appeal against this decision. The final act of Chester City's existence came in the High Court in London. HMRC had issued a winding up petition against Chester City, and at a hearing on 8 March 2010 the club chose not to defend itself against that petition. In a hearing lasting less than one minute, Chester City FC were wound up, and the club's 125-year history ended. The club was quickly reformed as Chester F.C., and joined the Northern Premier League Division One North for the 2010-11 season.

Hampstead, 11 August 1895; died Cookham 10 January 1980) was an English physicist and scientific administrator. His work on the magnetic spectrum of the beta-rays helped to develop a better understanding of nuclear structure. Education and internment Ellis was the son of Abraham Charles Ellis, a general manager of the Metropolitan Railway, and Isabelle Flockart Carswell. He won a scholarship to Harrow School where he excelled academically as well as at sport. In 1913 he became a cadet in the Royal Military Academy in preparation for a career in the Royal Engineers. He was holidaying in Germany the following summer when World War I broke out. All British nationals were rounded up and sent to the Ruhleben internment camp just outside Berlin. The camp had been a horse racecourse. During internment the detainees had a large degree of freedom. They had access to books, and Ellis made good use of his time to study. Another detainee in the camp was James Chadwick who was later to receive the Nobel Prize for his work on the discovery of the neutron. Chadwick inspired Ellis and together they erected a laboratory in one of the horse stables where they undertook scientific experiments on the photochemical process. Career after the war Sir Charles Drummond Ellis, FRS by Andrew Freeth After the war Ellis decided to abandon a military career. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied natural sciences. After graduating in 1920 he became engaged in research work at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, where the director, Sir Ernest Rutherford, had now engaged Chadwick. While Rutherford and Chadwick worked on alpha radioactivity and alpha particles for nuclear disintegration experiments Ellis studied beta and gamma radiation. He became a leading authority on the subject, publishing many articles in scientific journals. In 1921 Ellis had become a fellow of Trinity College and was appointed assistant lecturer in natural science. In 1925 he married Paula Warzcewska, the daughter of a wealthy Polish shipbuilder. Although there were no children Paula (known as Polly in England) had a daughter from a previous marriage. In 1929 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1930 Rutherford, Chadwick and Ellis published together a classic monograph Radiations from Radioactive Substances. Discovery of the neutrino During the early 1930s Ellis worked with Nevill Mott on energy relations in beta decay. Mott said later that Ellis had ‚Äúpractically discovered the neutrino‚Äù. He worked with W.J.Henderson on the energy distribution of positrons in artificial radioactivity. In 1936, a year after Chadwick‚Äôs appointment to a professorship at Liverpool, Ellis was appointed to the Wheatstone chair of physics at King's College London in succession to Edward Victor Appleton who had become professor of natural sciences at Cambridge. Ellis continued his research alongside his new teaching and administration commitments. In 1940 Ellis became a member of MAUD who were investigating the possibility of using nuclear fission to develop new weapons. He became scientific adviser to the army council from 1943‚Äì1946, serving on several high-level committees. He was knighted in 1946 for his war service. Later career After World War II Ellis held several posts which were not related to nuclear weapons. He was director of the Finance Corporation for Industry, in charge of research and development for the National Coal Board. He was president of the British Coal Utilization Research Association from 1946‚Äì1955 and a member of the advisory council to the minister of fuel and power from 1947 to 1955. He became scientific adviser to the British American Tobacco Company (BAT) at a time when the association between smoking and various diseases was just starting to be suspected. He retired from the Gas Council in 1966 and from BAT in 1972. During his final decade his health was poor. In 1980 he died in a nursing home in Cookham after a short illness. Ellis‚ÄìWooster experiment In 1927 Ellis and William Alfred Wooster (1903‚Äì1984) performed an important experiment with Œ≤-rays. Their experiment led to Pauli's suggestion of the neutrino.

Ellis (born October 22, 1937) is an American investment consultant. In 1972, Ellis founded Greenwich Associates, an international strategy consulting firm focused on financial institutions. Ellis is known for his philosophy of passive investing through index funds, as detailed in his book Winning the Loser‚Äôs Game.  Early life and education  Ellis was born in 1937 in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts. Ellis‚Äô father, Raymond W., served in the Navy during World War II. Ellis went to the Phillips Exeter Academy and then Yale College where he received his BA in Art History in 1959. At Yale he was in Timothy Dwight College and served as Chairman of WYBC, the college‚Äôs student radio station. In 1963, Ellis graduated with distinction from Harvard Business School, which Ellis credits with being ‚Äúthe transforming experience‚Äù in his early life. Ellis went to work for the Rockefeller family office and began a Ph.D. program in Financial Economics at New York University, which he would complete over the following years.  Early career  After a brief stint with WGBH, Boston‚Äôs public radio station, and then serving in the Army, Ellis began work with the Rockefeller family investments office. In 1966, he joined Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Through his experience there, he developed the concept for Greenwich Associates, which he founded in 1972. During his 30 years as Managing Partner, Greenwich Associates grew to serve the leading firms in over 130 financial markets around the world with their widely recognized proprietary research.  Investment strategy  In 1975, Ellis authored the article ‚ÄúThe Loser‚Äôs Game,‚Äù in the Financial Analysts Journal. The article went on to win the Graham & Dodd award in 1977, and in it Ellis argued: > ‚ÄúThe investment management business (it should be a profession but is not) > is built upon a simple and basic belief: Professional money managers can > beat the market. That premise appears to be false.‚Äù Instead, Ellis advocated a strategy of diversified low-cost index fund investing, and he expanded on this approach in his book Winning the Loser‚Äôs Game. Ellis went on to write sixteen books and dozens of articles on investing, including: ‚ÄúThe Partnership,‚Äù the story of Goldman Sachs, and ‚ÄúWhat It Takes,‚Äù a study of great professional firms.  Teaching and university service  Ellis was appointed twice to the faculty of the Harvard Business School in 1970 and 1974 and to the Yale School of Management in 1986. At both Harvard and Yale, he taught advanced courses on investment management. Ellis served as a successor trustee of Yale University from 1997 to 2008, where he chaired the university‚Äôs investment committee for nine years alongside Chief Investment Officer David Swensen. He received the Yale Medal in 2009 for his service to the University. He has served on the board of directors of the Harvard Business School and received the school‚Äôs alumni award for lifelong service.  Public, civic and board service  Ellis served as chair of the board of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and is one of only twelve people recognized by the CFA Institute for lifetime contributions to the investment profession. He has also served as a trustee of Phillips Exeter Academy and Eagle Hill School, and as an Overseer of the Stern Schools of Business at New York University. After stepping down from Greenwich Associates, Ellis served as a director or advisor to numerous organizations. He served as a director of the Vanguard Group from 2001 to 2009, and also as a trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. He was managing partner of The Partners of ‚Äô63, a pro bono partnership of Harvard Business School classmates and associates, which supported entrepreneurship in education. Internationally, Ellis has served as an advisor to the GIC of Singapore, as well as to the ‚Äúfuture funds‚Äù of New Zealand and Australia. He currently serves as chair of the Board of Directors of Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. Additionally, he serves on the advisory boards of Wealthfront, Rebalance, The Water Company, GeoSynFuels, and IMDx. In addition, he has on the boards of the Long Wharf Theatre and a number of regional Connecticut organizations.

Its object is to promote the study of caves and associated phenomena, and it attains this by supporting cave and karst research, encouraging original exploration (both in the UK and on expeditions overseas), collecting and publishing speleological information, maintaining a library and organising educational and scientific conferences and meetings. BCRA is a registered charity in the UK, and a constituent body of the British Caving Association (BCA), undertaking charitable activities on behalf of BCA.  History  The British Cave Research Association arose from a merger in 1973 of the British Speleological Association (BSA) and the Cave Research Group of Great Britain (CRG). When the National Caving Association (NCA) was formed in 1968, BCRA became one of its constituent bodies. Although NCA was recognised as the governing body for UK caving by the Sports Council it did not allow individual membership and so BCRA was seen by many as de facto the national body. This situation was resolved in 2005 when NCA was dissolved and a new body, the British Caving Association took over NCA's function as the governing body for UK caving (as recognised by the Sports Council). BCA consolidated various of the 'national body' services formerly provided by NCA and BCRA. At the start of 2006, a new membership structure limited BCRA membership to BCA members, who now pay a supplement to join BCRA. Having passed on most of its functions to BCA, BCRA is now able to focus entirely on cave science, technology and heritage matters; the latter involving the cataloguing of the vast amount of library and archive material that BCRA has collected over the years.  Publications  One of BCRA's main activities is publishing. It publishes the periodical Cave and Karst Science (three issues per year) and the annual BCRA Review. The BCRA Review replaces Speleology, which was published from 2003 to 2014, as BCRA's Bulletin. Prior to 2003, Speleology was published under the title Caves & Caving. BCRA also publishes the Cave Studies series of booklets and manages various Special Interest Groups that also publish material, notably the Cave Radio & Electronics Group Journal. In 2013 BCRA published the first volume of a major work, Caves and Karst of the Yorkshire Dales, edited by Tony Waltham and David Lowe, with Volume 2 published in 2017.  Conference and meetings  In 1996 the UK's annual caving conference (the 'BCRA Conference') was given a face-lift and re- titled Hidden Earth. Although BCRA still underwrites the event, it is now billed as being jointly hosted by BCRA and BCA. BCRA hosts an annual Science Symposium at which short papers are informally presented. Contributions are invited on any aspect of cave or karst science or caving technology and abstracts are published in Cave & Karst Science. BCRA has also hosted symposiums on Cave Technology, featuring contributions from its Special Interest Groups.  Library  The British Caving Library (BCL) is a national research and reference library based in the Peak District, owned by BCRA and staffed part-time by a librarian. It mostly comprises published and archived material collected by BCRA and its predecessor organisations, with a minority of the items on long-term loan from clubs and individuals. The library function with the financial assistance of the British Caving Association, through which the library is able to offer its services to all cavers and to all those interested in cave science and related topics. The library comprises a reference section and an archive section of older material. The reference section includes a large collection of books and journals on caving topics from Britain and abroad, which is frequently updated by donations and by journal exchanges with many caving clubs worldwide. Following an agreement with the National Geoscience Data Centre at the British Geological Survey (BGS), the archive material specifically relating to BCRA and its predecessor organisations was moved, in 2009, to BGS for safe-keeping in controlled storage conditions. For further information see the British Caving Library website, which includes an on-line catalogue of the collection, and an on-line audio archive.  Cave survey grading system  BCRA produced a methodology in the 1960s to assess the accuracy, or grade, of a cave survey. It remains in common use today and is based on a scale of six grades.

He founded Juntas Castellanas de Actuaci√≥n Hisp√°nica (the Castilian Hispanic Action Groups), a political group that merged with Ramiro Ledesma's Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (Unions of the National-Syndicalist Offensive) and Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera's Falange Espa√±ola. Together with Ledesma and Primo de Rivera, Redondo was one of the key figures of Francoist propaganda.  Biography  Redondo was born in Quintanilla de Abajo (renamed after him as Quintanilla de On√©simo), Valladolid to a family of landowners. His father was Buenaventura Redondo Iglesias and his mother was Juana Ortega Pico. He studied jurisprudence at the University of Salamanca and subsequently taught Spanish at the University of Mannheim (1927‚Äì1928), where he became acquainted with Nazism. (Historian Paul Preston has written that Redondo's anti-Semitism derived more from fifteenth century Castile than from Nazi models however, though he did translate Hitler's Mein Kampf into Spanish.) He worked in Valladolid for the Castilian union of sugar beet harvesters and joined the Acci√≥n Nacional during his youth. He was greatly influenced by Enrique Herrera Oria, brother of the founder of the Asociaci√≥n Nacional Cat√≥lica de Propagandistas and editor of El Debate, √Ångel Herrera Oria. Enrique Herrera believed that communism, Freemasonry and Judaism were working to destroy religion and the Fatherland, and encouraged Redondo to read the virulent anti-Jewish tract by L√©on de Poncins, Las fuerzas secretas de la Revolucion. L√©on de Poncins, author of the virulent anti-Jewish and anti-Masonic tract, Las fuerzas secretas de la RevolucionA Spanish translation of Les Forces secr√®tes de la R√©volution; which was translated into English as The Secret Powers Behind Revolution‚Äî the work which introduced Redondo to The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and fed his anti-Semitism When the Second Republic was proclaimed in 1931, and after the elections of June 1931 gave a majority to the Republican-Socialist coalition, he rejected democracy and broke from Acci√≥n Nacional. On 13 June in Valladolid he brought out the anti- Republican newspaper Libertad, where he wrote violently against Marxism, Jews (he published an annotated translation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion), and bourgeois Capitalism, and admired European fascisms. He founded a fascist party, Juntas Castellanas de Actuaci√≥n Hisp√°nica (the Castilian Hispanic Action Groups) in August 1931 and in November it merged with Ramiro Ledesma Ramos's La Conquista del Estado to form the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (JONS). They refused to participate in elections because they believed in direct action. It was anti-democratic and imperialist and sought the \\"extermination of the Marxist parties\\". Redondo and the JHAC sought violent confrontation and recruits armed themselves for street fights with the predominantly Socialist working class of Valadolid, a city previously noted for the tranquility of its labor relations. In Redondo's rhetoric, Moors, Jews, and the Left were all merged into one: by asserting that Marxism was a Jewish invention and implied the 're-africanisation' of Spain, Redondo was identifying Spain's archetypal others, the Jew and the Moor with the Right's new enemy: the Left. The war Spain needed to fight was a new 'Reconquista', and ideologues such as Redondo's offered a 'murderous justification of violence against the left.' In 1932, he collaborated with the frustrated coup d'√©tat of General Sanjurjo and had to flee to Portugal. He returned to Valladolid in April 1933. On 24 March 1934 JONS and Falange Espa√±ola merged. He was arrested on 19 March 1936, and was moved to the prison in √Åvila in June. He was freed by the Nationalists after the beginning of the Civil War. He organized the Falange's militias in Valladolid and commanded the so-called \\"dawn patrols\\" that were responsible for the murder of hundreds of suspected liberals and leftists in Valladolid. He then left for the Guadarrama mountains, where he died in combat in Labajos, Segovia on July 24. Francoist propaganda extolled him insistently as a war hero. Legacy His widow, Mercedes Sanz-Bachiller, founded Auxilio de Invierno (Winter Aid), after Auxilio Social (Social Aid), which was the welfare agency of Falange, further fully integrated in the Francoist State organization.

She achieved recognition both domestically and abroad for her work.EXPOSICI√ìN ART√çSTICA DE OLGA DE CHICA EN LA CASA DE LA CULTURA DE FILANDIA Biography Olga de Chica was born in Filandia, in the coffee region of Quind√≠o, Colombia in August 1921. She attended the Sacred Heart of Jesus High School in Filandia and the School of Fine Arts in Manizales. De Chica started painting as a child, when it is said she used squeezed flowers in an attempt to create lively colors. However, the bulk of her lifetime was spent as the wife of a local school teacher, and the mother of two daughters and a son. It was not until she was approaching her fifties that she became a professional painter. De Chica painted in a style that is described as \\"primitivist\\", which she developed organically without any formal artistic training. Her works are mainly populated landscapes that communicate the look and feel of the typical, though sometimes nostalgic, life in rural Colombia. Her works are noted for their vibrant colors and charming representations of Colombian wildlife. Rural life, small towns and the coffee region of Quind√≠o were the focus of her later work. She died in Manizales in December 2016 at the age of 95.Olga de Chica, artista de Filandia y del Paisaje Cafetero, a un a√±o de su muerte References External links * http://ywcanca.org/art_exhibit.asp#Artists * http://secondsightdc.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_archive.html * Personajesdefilandia Blog with newspaper review of the artist Publicado en el diario La Cr√≥nica del Quind√≠o October 30th 1996 1921 births 2016 deaths 21st-century women artists Colombian painters Colombian women painters ","title":"Olga de Chica"},{"id":"13294049","text":"Baron was an admiral in the early Imperial Japanese Navy, and served as Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff in the late 19th century. Biography Arichi was born in Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain (now Yamaguchi Prefecture. His younger brother was Admiral Nashiba Tokioki. As a samurai youth, he fought in the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate, participating in combat in the northern Tohoku campaign. He was then dispatched by the domain to Europe for studies, observing military operations in the Franco-Prussian War first- hand. On his return to Japan, he was commissioned as a major in the new Imperial Japanese Army in 1871. Under the new Meiji government, he served in the Ministry of War, and transferred to the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy in 1873 with the rank of lieutenant commander. He was thus was of the few men from Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain to choose the navy over the army as a career. It is not certain why he made this choice, but some historians theorize it was part of a strategy by the Ch≈çsh≈´ clan leaders to ensure that the navy did not become a Satsuma monopoly. Arichi was captain of the frigate in 1878 and corvette in 1881. After his promotion to the rank of captain in 1882, he was assigned as commanding officer of the corvette , followed by Tsukuba. In 1884, while captain of Tsukuba, the ship suffered from an outbreak of beriberi in which 23 crewmen died. Subsequently, Tsukuba was used as the basis of a successful experiment by naval doctor Takaki Kanehiro into the sailors' diet, which later eliminated beriberi as an issue within the Japanese navy. Arichi was promoted to rear admiral on 15 June 1886 and became commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy from 1887 to 1889. He was Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff from 1889 to 1891. From 1891 to 1892, Arichi served as commander in chief of the Readiness Fleet. He was promoted to vice admiral in 1892. During the First Sino-Japanese War, he was initially commander in chief of Kure Naval District, and became commander in chief of the Combined Fleet from May to October 1895, overseeing in the Japanese invasion of Taiwan. During this campaign, the captain of the cruiser provoked a diplomatic incident with the United Kingdom when he stopped and boarded the British-flagged merchant ship SS Thales in international waters off of Amoy on the morning of 21 October 1895 in search of Liu Yongfu, the fugitive president of the Republic of Formosa. Due to the diplomatic protest over the violation of British neutrality, the Japanese government was forced to issue an official apology and forced Arichi into retirement. On 5 June 1896, Arichi was ennobled with the title of baron (danshaku) under the kazoku peerage system. Arichi served in the House of Peers from 1897 to 1904. He retired in 1911, but continued to serve as a member of the Privy Council from 1914 until his death in 1919. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

They are known for their authentic Perico Ripiao, their rendition of \\"Negro Cruz y Tono Colon\\", and rivalries with fellow musicians Geovanny Polanco and, especially, El Prodigio. Many within the group Kerubanda were originally members of the band headed by Krency Garcia (El Prodigio) but broke contract to play with Kerube Ortiz. This caused a lot of internal friction within the genre and bad blood between band leaders, but things worked themselves out eventually. Their band includes g√ºira, tambora, accordion, bass, saxophone, conga, electric piano, and 3 vocalists (each for different rhythms of the music).  History  Kerube Ortiz, the band's leader and accordionist, was born in Santiago Rodriguez in the Dominican Republic. While growing up as a child, his father bought him his first accordion, which had 10 notes. With practice Kerube became a good player and performed at small parties and social gatherings. In the 1990s, Kerube formed Kerube Ortiz y su Cojunto Tipico in New York, whose population of Dominican merengue tipico musicians was starting to boom. Later, he formed La Kerubanda and made his debut on June 9, 2004, on a TV show called El Show de Nelson. He made his first appearance live in Santiago Rodriguez on June 18, 2004. Growing up, his idols were famed merengue tipico accordionists El Ciego de Nagua and Tatico Henriquez, who also influenced El Prodigio. Sometime during November 1‚Äì3, 2008, Kerube Ortiz had a group meeting and decided to continue his music project on his own. All the musicians that were once with Kerubanda have now formed the REAL Banda. The group has picked a new accordionist, Berny Jhon. Since, Kerube has fled to the United States to avoid debts that have been accumulating in the Dominican Republic. An order for imprisonment has been taken out against him, for the substantial amounts owed.

Career Jos√© Su√°rez made his debut in a short role in Altar Mayor (1944), a very conventional film, whose director, Gonzalo Delgr√°s, had paid attention to him in his work as a train conductor in Asturias. He played increasingly important roles in following Delgr√°s's movies and by 1948 he was already a lead actor. He then became very popular in Spain along the late 40s and early 50s, as one of the main heartthrobs of the Spanish cinema, along with his contemporaries Francisco Rabal, Jorge Mistral and Alfredo Mayo. Nevertheless, he performed remarkably in three outstanding dramas, namely Brigada criminal (1950), Condenados (1953) and As√≠ es Madrid (1953), in the screen version of Buero Vallejo\`s most famous play, Historia de una escalera (1950), and in the historical superproduction (for Spanish standards) Alba de Am√©rica (Dawn of America, 1951), playing King Fernando el Cat√≥lico. He portrayed Zorro in the film La monta√±a sin ley (Lawless mountain) (1953), making him the first Spanish actor in the role.Movies list at Zorro.com He also co-starred with the popular Andalusian gipsy singer and dancer Lola Flores in La danza de los deseos (1954), directed by the most prestigious veteran Spanish film-maker, Flori√°n Rey. In 1955 he co-starred Se√±ora Ama with the Mexican and Hollywood star Dolores del R√≠o. In 1956, his lead role in the internationally acclaimed Calle Mayor (undoubtedly his best role, his best performance and his best film, although he always preferred Condenados) provided him with the opportunity to work in Italy with well-known film directors as Luigi Zampa in The Magistrate, starring with Claudia Cardinale, and Francesco Rosi in La sfida, starring with Rosanna Schiaffino, while he gradually lost his popularity in his home country, despite still appearing in the 60s in some interesting Spanish movies, such as A tiro limpio (1963) or La boda (1964).

Despite appearing too in two successful mainstream Italian films: Scano Boa (1961) and Sette uomini d'oro (1965), eventually he was almost confined to the Spanish-Italian sword and sandal and spaghetti westerns movies, the most interesting of all them being The Price of Power (1969), also known as Il Prezzo del potere or La Muerte de un Presidente. And he even played the lead in El Llanero (1964), one of the first films directed by the (in)famous master of the sexually charged horror films, Jes√∫s Franco. In the 70's he played too for the National Spanish television in a few series, including a Spanish-Italian coproduction on the life of Crist√≥bal Col√≥n.

The maps above compare the Arctic ice minimum extents from 2012 (top) and 1984 (bottom). In 1984 the sea ice extent was roughly the average of the minimum from 1979 to 2000, and so was a typical year. The minimum sea ice extent in 2012 was roughly half of that average. The effects of global warming in the Arctic, or climate change in the Arctic include rising air and water temperatures, loss of sea ice, and melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a related cold temperature anomaly, observed since the 1970s. Related impacts include ocean circulation changes, increased input of freshwater, and ocean acidification. Indirect effects through potential climate teleconnections to mid latitudes may result in a greater frequency of extreme weather events (flooding, fires and drought), ecological, biological and phenology changes, biological migrations and extinctions, natural resource stresses and as well as human health, displacement and security issues. Potential methane releases from the region, especially through the thawing of permafrost and methane clathrates, may occur. Presently, the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. The pronounced warming signal, the amplified response of the Arctic to global warming, is often seen as a leading indicator of global warming. The melting of Greenland's ice sheet is linked to polar amplification.Study links 2015 melting Greenland ice to faster Arctic warming 9 June 2016 University of Georgia The warming in the Arctic is primarily caused by human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Rising temperatures  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \\"warming in the Arctic, as indicated by daily maximum and minimum temperatures, has been as great as in any other part of the world.\\" The period of 1995‚Äì2005 was the warmest decade in the Arctic since at least the 17th century, with temperatures above the 1951‚Äì1990 average. Some regions within the Arctic have warmed even more rapidly, with Alaska and western Canada's temperature rising by .Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (2004): Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. Cambridge University Press, , siehe online This warming has been caused not only by the rise in greenhouse gas concentration, but also the deposition of soot on Arctic ice.Quinn, P.K., T. S. Bates, E. Baum et al. (2007): Short-lived pollutants in the Arctic: their climate impact and possible mitigation strategies, in: Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, Vol. 7, S. 15669‚Äì15692, siehe online A 2013 article published in Geophysical Research Letters has shown that temperatures in the region haven't been as high as they currently are since at least 44,000 years ago and perhaps as long as 120,000 years ago. The authors conclude that \\"anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases have led to unprecedented regional warmth.\\"Arctic Temperatures Highest in at Least 44,000 Years, Livescience, 24 October 2013 On 20 June 2020, for the first time, a temperature measurement was made inside the Arctic Circle of 38 ¬∞C, more than 100 ¬∞F. This kind of weather was expected in the region only by 2100. In March, April and May the average temperature in the Arctic was 10 ¬∞C higher than normal. This heat wave, without human - induced warming, could happen only one time in 80,000 years, according to an attribution study published in July 2020. It is the strongest link of a weather event to anthropogenic climate change that had been ever found, for now. Such heat waves are generally a result of an unusual state of the jet stream. Some scientists suggest that climate change will slow the jet stream by reducing the difference in temperature between the Arctic and more southern territories, because the Arctic is warming faster. This can facilitate the occurring of such heat waves. The scientists do not know if the 2020 heat wave is the result of such change. =Arctic amplification= The poles of the Earth are more sensitive to any change in the planet's climate than the rest of the planet. In the face of ongoing global warming, the poles are warming faster than lower latitudes. The primary cause of this phenomenon is ice- albedo feedback where, by melting, ice uncovers darker land or ocean beneath, which then absorbs more sunlight, causing more heating.Cecilia Bitz (2006): Polar Amplification, in: RealClimate.org The loss of the Arctic sea ice may represent a tipping point in global warming, when 'runaway' climate change starts, but on this point the science is not yet settled. According to a 2015 study, based on computer modelling of aerosols in the atmosphere, up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of the warming observed in the Arctic between 1980 and 2005 is due to aerosol reductions in Europe. =Black carbon= Black carbon deposits (from the exhaust system of marine engines that often run on bunker fuel) reduce the albedo when deposited on snow and ice, and thus accelerate the effect of the melting of snow and sea ice.Seablind documentary mentioning that the burning of bunker fuel by ships contributes to black carbon deposits on snow and ice in the Arctic A 2013 study quantified that gas flaring at petroleum extraction sites contributed over 40% of the black carbon deposited in the Arctic. According to a 2015 study, reductions in black carbon emissions and other minor greenhouse gases, by roughly 60 percent, could cool the Arctic up to 0.2 ¬∞C by 2050. Decline of sea ice Sea ice is currently in decline in area, extent, and volume and summertime sea ice may cease to exist sometime during the 21st century. Sea ice area refers to the total area covered by ice, whereas sea ice extent is the area of ocean with at least 15% sea ice, while the volume is the total amount of ice in the Arctic. =Changes in extent and area= sea ice extent in million square kilometers. Blue shading indicates the pre-satellite era; data then is less reliable. In particular, the near- constant level extent in autumn up to 1940 reflects lack of data rather than a real lack of variation. Reliable measurement of sea ice edges began with the satellite era in the late 1970s. Before this time, sea ice area and extent were monitored less precisely by a combination of ships, buoys and aircraft. The data show a long-term negative trend in recent years, attributed to global warming, although there is also a considerable amount of variation from year to year. Some of this variation may be related to effects such as the Arctic oscillation, which may itself be related to global warming. The Arctic sea ice September minimum extent (i.e., area with at least 15% sea ice coverage) reached new record lows in 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2012. The 2007 melt season let to a minimum 39% below the 1979‚Äì2000 average, and for the first time in human memory, the fabled Northwest Passage opened completely. The dramatic 2007 melting surprised and concerned scientists. Sea ice coverage in 1980 (bottom) and 2012 (top), as observed by passive microwave sensors on NASA's Nimbus-7 satellite and by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Multi-year ice is shown in bright white, while average sea ice cover is shown in light blue to milky white. The data shows the ice cover for the period of 1 November through 31 January in their respective years. From 2008 to 2011, Arctic sea ice minimum extent was higher than 2007, but it did not return to the levels of previous years. In 2012 however, the 2007 record low was broken in late August with three weeks still left in the melt season. It continued to fall, bottoming out on 16 September 2012 at 3.41 million square kilometers (1.32 million square miles), or 760,000 square kilometers (293,000 square miles) below the previous low set on 18 September 2007 and 50% below the 1979‚Äì2000 average.Record Arctic sea ice minimum confirmed by NSIDC The rate of the decline in entire Arctic ice coverage is accelerating. From 1979 to 1996, the average per decade decline in entire ice coverage was a 2.2% decline in ice extent and a 3% decline in ice area. For the decade ending 2008, these values have risen to 10.1% and 10.7%, respectively. These are comparable to the September to September loss rates in year-round ice (i.e., perennial ice, which survives throughout the year), which averaged a retreat of 10.2% and 11.4% per decade, respectively, for the period 1979‚Äì2007. =Changes in volume= Seasonal variation and long-term decrease of Arctic sea ice volume as determined by measurement backed numerical modelling. The sea ice thickness field and accordingly the ice volume and mass, is much more difficult to determine than the extension. Exact measurements can be made only at a limited number of points. Because of large variations in ice and snow thickness and consistency air- and spaceborne-measurements have to be evaluated carefully. Nevertheless, the studies made support the assumption of a dramatic decline in ice age and thickness. While the Arctic ice area and extent show an accelerating downward trend, arctic ice volume shows an even sharper decline than the ice coverage. Since 1979, the ice volume has shrunk by 80% and in just the past decade the volume declined by 36% in the autumn and 9% in the winter. =An end to summer sea ice?= The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 summarized the current state of sea ice projections: \\"the projected reduction [in global sea ice cover] is accelerated in the Arctic, where some models project summer sea ice cover to disappear entirely in the high-emission A2 scenario in the latter part of the 21st century.‚Ä≥ However, current climate models frequently underestimate the rate of sea ice retreat. A summertime ice- free Arctic would be unprecedented in recent geologic history, as currently scientific evidence does not indicate an ice-free polar sea anytime in the last 700,000 years. The Arctic ocean will likely be free of summer sea ice before the year 2100, but many different dates have been projected, with models showing near-complete to complete loss in September from 2035 to some time around 2067. Permafrost thaw Rapidly thawing Arctic permafrost and coastal erosion on the Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean, near Point Lonely, AK. Photo Taken in August 2013 Permafrost thaw ponds on Baffin Island Human caused climate change leads to higher temperatures that cause permafrost thawing in the Arctic. The thawing of the various types of Arctic permafrost could release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. In the permafrost there is twice as much carbon as in the atmosphere, but scientists estimate that no more than 100 billion tonnes will be released in the 21th century (humanity emit each year 40 billion). In 2019, a report called \\" Arctic report card \\" estimated the current greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic permafrost as almost equal to the emissions of Russia or Japan or less than 10% of the global emissions from fossil fuels. It has been estimated that about two- thirds of released carbon escapes to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, originating primarily from ancient ice deposits along the ~7,000 kilometer long coastline of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) and shallow subsea permafrost. Following thaw, collapse and erosion of coastline and seafloor deposits may accelerate with Arctic amplification of climate warming. Climate models suggest that during periods of rapid sea-ice loss, temperatures could increase as far as inland, accelerating the rate of terrestrial permafrost thaw, with consequential effects on carbon and methane release. As of 2018, modeling of the permafrost carbon feedback has focused on gradual surface thawing, models have yet to account for deeper soil layers. A new study used field observations, radiocarbon dating, and remote sensing to account for thermokarst lakes, the authors concluded that, \\"..methane and carbon dioxide emissions from abrupt thaw beneath thermokarst lakes will more than double radiative forcing from circumpolar permafrost-soil carbon fluxes this century.\\" Thawing permafrost represents a threat to industrial infrastructure. In May 2020, permafrost melting due to climate change caused the worst oil spill to date in the Arctic. The melting of permafrost caused a collapse of a fuel tank, spilling 6,000 tonnes of diesel into the land, 15,000 into the water. The rivers Ambarnaya, Daldykan and many smaller rivers were polluted. The pollution reached the lake Pyasino that is important to the water supply of the entire Taimyr Peninsula. State of emergency at the federal level was declared. Many buildings and infrastructure are built on permafrost, which cover 65% of Russian territory, and all those can be damaged as it melts. The melting can also cause leakage of toxic elements from sites of buried toxic waste. =Subsea permafrost= Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions. This source of methane is different from methane clathrates, but contributes to the overall outcome and feedbacks. Sea ice serves to stabilise methane deposits on and near the shoreline, preventing the clathrate breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100‚Äì630 mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, which is really important for the Arctic. An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017. Changes in vegetation Bloody Falls in July 2007. Western Hemisphere Arctic Vegetation Index Trend Eastern Hemisphere Vegetation Index Trend Changes in vegetation are associated with the increases in landscape scale methane emissions. The growing season has lengthened in the far northern latitudes, bringing major changes to plant communities in tundra and boreal (also known as taiga) ecosystems. For decades, NASA and NOAA satellites have continuously monitored vegetation from space. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments measure the intensity of visible and near- infrared light reflecting off of plant leaves. Scientists use the information to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of photosynthetic activity or ‚Äúgreenness‚Äù of the landscape. The maps above show the Arctic Vegetation Index Trend between July 1982 and December 2011 in the Arctic Circle. Shades of green depict areas where plant productivity and abundance increased; shades of brown show where photosynthetic activity declined. The maps show a ring of greening in the treeless tundra ecosystems of the circumpolar Arctic‚Äîthe northernmost parts of Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia. Tall shrubs and trees started to grow in areas that were previously dominated by tundra grasses. The researchers concluded that plant growth had increased by 7 to 10 percent overall. However, boreal forests, particularly those in North America, showed a different response to warming. Many boreal forests greened, but the trend was not as strong as it was for tundra of the circumpolar Arctic. In North America, some boreal forests actually experienced ‚Äúbrowning‚Äù (less photosynthetic activity) over the study period. Droughts, forest fire activity, animal and insect behavior, industrial pollution, and a number of other factors may have contributed to the browning. \\"Satellite data identify areas in the boreal zone that are warmer and drier and other areas that are warmer and wetter,\\" explained co-author Ramakrishna Nemani of NASA's Ames Research Center. \\"Only the warmer and wetter areas support more growth.\\" \\"We found more plant growth in the boreal zone from 1982 to 1992 than from 1992 to 2011, because water limitations were encountered in the later two decades of our study,\\" added co-author Sangram Ganguly of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute and NASA Ames. The less severe winters in tundra areas allow shrubs such as alders and dwarf birch to replace moss and lichens. The impact on mosses and lichens is unclear as there exist very few studies at species level, also climate change is more likely to cause increased fluctuation and more frequent extreme events. The feedback effect of shrubs on the tundra's permafrost is unclear. In the winter they trap more snow which insulates the permafrost from extreme cold spells, but in the summer they shade the ground from direct sunlight. The warming is likely to cause changes in the plant communities. Except for an increase in shrubs, warming may also cause a decline in cushion plants such as moss campion. Since cushion plants act as facilitator species across trophic level and fill important roles in severe environments this could cause cascading effects in the ecosystems. Rising summer temperature melts on Canada's Baffin Island have revealed moss previously covered which has not seen daylight in 44,000 years.On the Cusp of Climate Change 22.September.2014 The New York Times The reduction of sea ice has boosted the productivity of phytoplankton by about twenty percent over the past thirty years. However, the effect on marine ecosystems is unclear, since the larger types of phytoplankton, which are the preferred food source of most zooplankton, do not appear to have increased as much as the smaller types. So far, Arctic phytoplankton have not had a significant impact on the global carbon cycle. In summer, the melt ponds on young and thin ice have allowed sunlight to penetrate the ice, in turn allowing phytoplankton to bloom in unexpected concentrations, although it is unknown just how long this phenomenon has been occurring. The increase of heat waves causes an increase in wildfires. In 2019 - 2020 the wildfires in Peatlands release more carbon to the atmosphere in 18 months than in the previous 16 years. The heat wave leaded to increase in the number of Siberian silk moths that damaged trees what help increase wildfires. Changes for animals The northward shift of the subarctic climate zone is allowing animals that are adapted to that climate to move into the far north, where they are replacing species that are more adapted to a pure Arctic climate. Where the Arctic species are not being replaced outright, they are often interbreeding with their southern relations. Among slow-breeding vertebrate species, this often has the effect of reducing the genetic diversity of the genus. Another concern is the spread of infectious diseases, such as brucellosis or phocine distemper virus, to previously untouched populations. This is a particular danger among marine mammals who were previously segregated by sea ice. Projected change in polar bear habitat from 2001‚Äì2010 to 2041‚Äì2050 3 April 2007, the National Wildlife Federation urged the United States Congress to place polar bears under the Endangered Species Act. Four months later, the United States Geological Survey completed a year-long study which concluded in part that the floating Arctic sea ice will continue its rapid shrinkage over the next 50 years, consequently wiping out much of the polar bear habitat. The bears would disappear from Alaska, but would continue to exist in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and areas off the northern Greenland coast. Secondary ecological effects are also resultant from the shrinkage of sea ice; for example, polar bears are denied their historic length of seal hunting season due to late formation and early thaw of pack ice. Some 200 Svalbard reindeer were found starved to death in July 2019, apparently due to low precipitation related to climate change.More Than 200 Reindeer Found Dead in Norway, Starved by Climate Change By Mindy Weisberger. Live Science, July 29, 2019 In the short-term, climate warming may have neutral or positive effects on the nesting cycle of many Arctic-breeding shorebirds. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet Albedo Change on Greenland Greenland ice sheet mass trend (2003‚Äì2005) Models predict a sea-level contribution of about from melting of the Greenland ice sheet during the 21st century. It is also predicted that Greenland will become warm enough by 2100 to begin an almost complete melt during the next 1,000 years or more. In early July 2012, 97% percent of the ice sheet experienced some form of surface melt, including the summits. Ice thickness measurements from the GRACE satellite indicate that ice mass loss is accelerating. For the period 2002‚Äì2009, the rate of loss increased from 137 Gt/yr to 286 Gt/yr, with every year seeing on average 30 gigatonnes more mass lost than in the preceding year. T The rate of melting was 4 times higher in 2019 than in 2003. In the year 2019 the melting contributed 2.2 millimeters to sea level rise in just 2 months. The United States built a secret nuclear powered base, called Camp Century, in the Greenland ice sheet. In 2016, a group of scientists evaluated the environmental impact and estimated that due to changing weather patterns over the next few decades, melt water could release the nuclear waste, 20,000 liters of chemical waste and 24 million liters of untreated sewage into the environment. However, so far neither US or Denmark has taken responsibility for the clean-up. According to a study published in \\"Nature Communications Earth and Environment\\" the Greenland ice sheet is possibly past the point of no return, meaning that even if the rise in temperature were to completely stop and even if the climate were to become a little colder the melting would continue. This is because the movement of ice from the middle of Greenland to the coast creates a larger contact between the ice and the warm water that leads to more melting and calving. Another climate scientist says that after all the ice near the coast melts, the contact between the seawater and the ice will stop what can prevent further warming. In September 2020, satellite imagery showed that a big chunk of ice shattered into many small pieces from the last remaining ice shelf in Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, Greenland. Effect on ocean circulation Although this is now thought unlikely in the near future, it has also been suggested that there could be a shutdown of thermohaline circulation, similar to that which is believed to have driven the Younger Dryas, an abrupt climate change event. There is also potentially a possibility of a more general disruption of ocean circulation, which may lead to an ocean anoxic event; these are believed to be much more common in the distant past. It is unclear whether the appropriate pre-conditions for such an event exist today. Territorial claims Growing evidence that global warming is shrinking polar ice has added to the urgency of several nations' Arctic territorial claims in hopes of establishing resource development and new shipping lanes, in addition to protecting sovereign rights. Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig M√∏ller and Greenland's Premier Hans Enoksen invited foreign ministers from Canada, Norway, Russia and the United States to Ilulissat, Greenland, for a summit in May 2008 to discuss how to divide borders in the changing Arctic region, and a discussion on more cooperation against climate change affecting the Arctic. At the Arctic Ocean Conference, Foreign Ministers and other officials representing the five countries announced the Ilulissat Declaration on 28 May 2008. Social impacts People are affecting the geographic space of the Arctic and the Arctic is affecting the population. Much of the climate change in the Arctic can be attributed to humans influences on the atmosphere, such as an increased greenhouse effect caused by the increase in due to the burning of fossil fuels. Climate change is having a direct impact on the people that live in the Arctic, as well as other societies around the world. The warming environment presents challenges to local communities such as the Inuit. Hunting, which is a major way of survival for some small communities, will be changed with increasing temperatures. The reduction of sea ice will cause certain species populations to decline or even become extinct. In good years, some communities are fully employed by the commercial harvest of certain animals. The harvest of different animals fluctuates each year and with the rise of temperatures it is likely to continue changing and creating issues for Inuit hunters. Unsuspected changes in river and snow conditions will cause herds of animals, including reindeer, to change migration patterns, calving grounds, and forage availability. Other forms of transportation in the Arctic have seen negative impacts from the current warming, with some transportation routes and pipelines on land being disrupted by the melting of ice. Many Arctic communities rely on frozen roadways to transport supplies and travel from area to area. The changing landscape and unpredictability of weather is creating new challenges in the Arctic. researchers have documented historical and current trails created by the Inuit in the Pan Inuit Trails Atlas, finding that the change in sea ice formation and breakup has resulted in changes to the routes of trails created by the Inuit. The climate change in the Arctic is also affecting the quality and characteristics of snow which is used to build shelters such as igloos. It also provides unpredictable rain schedules and weather changes which impacts the people in Arctic in their daily lives. Since their tradition, culture, and knowledges are all developed within their ecosystems, the rapid climate change in Arctic affect the indigenous people living in Arctic requiring them to change such as identity and diet. =Navigation= The Transpolar Sea Route is a future Arctic shipping lane running from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean across the center of the Arctic Ocean. The route is also sometimes called Trans-Arctic Route. In contrast to the Northeast Passage (including the Northern Sea Route) and the North-West Passage it largely avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies in international high seas. Governments and private industry have shown a growing interest in the Arctic. Major new shipping lanes are opening up: the northern sea route had 34 passages in 2011 while the Northwest Passage had 22 traverses, more than any time in history. Shipping companies may benefit from the shortened distance of these northern routes. Access to natural resources will increase, including valuable minerals and offshore oil and gas. Finding and controlling these resources will be difficult with the continually moving ice. Tourism may also increase as less sea ice will improve safety and accessibility to the Arctic. The melting of Arctic ice caps is likely to increase traffic in and the commercial viability of the Northern Sea Route. One study, for instance, projects, \\"remarkable shifts in trade flows between Asia and Europe, diversion of trade within Europe, heavy shipping traffic in the Arctic and a substantial drop in Suez traffic. Projected shifts in trade also imply substantial pressure on an already threatened Arctic ecosystem.\\" Research =National= Individual countries within the Arctic zone, Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States (Alaska) conduct independent research through a variety of organizations and agencies, public and private, such as Russia's Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute. Countries who do not have Arctic claims, but are close neighbors, conduct Arctic research as well, such as the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration (CAA). The United States's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) produces an Arctic Report Card annually, containing peer-reviewed information on recent observations of environmental conditions in the Arctic relative to historical records. =International= International cooperative research between nations has become increasingly important: * Arctic climate change is summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its series of Assessment Reports and the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. * European Space Agency (ESA) launched CryoSat-2 on 8 April 2010. It provides satellite data on Arctic ice cover change rates. * International Arctic Buoy Program: deploys and maintains buoys that provide real-time position, pressure, temperature, and interpolated ice velocity data * International Arctic Research Center: Main participants are the United States and Japan. * International Arctic Science Committee: non- governmental organization (NGO) with diverse membership, including 23 countries from 3 continents. * 'Role of the Arctic Region', in conjunction with the International Polar Year, was the focus of the second international conference on Global Change Research, held in Nyn√§shamn, Sweden, October 2007. * SEARCH (Study of Environmental Arctic Change): A research framework originally promoted by several US agencies; an international extension is ISAC (the International Study of Arctic Change).

It is known in Pakistan as the \\"Anglo-Brusho War\\". When Mortimer Durand, Secretary for State of India was appointed administrator of the Gilgit Agency, he opened up the region by building roads, telegraph, and mail systems while maintaining a dialogue with the Mir of Gilgit. He intended to improve the road from Kashmir through Hunza and Nagar and up to the frontier with Russia. The Mirs of Nagar and Hunza saw this as a threat to their natural advantage of remoteness. In 1890, Durant reinforced Chalt Fort that was near the border due to the rumor that Nagar and Hunza fighters were about to attack it, and continued redeveloping the road up to the fort. In May 1891, Nagar and Hunza sent a warning to Durant not to continue work on the road to the fort and to vacate the fort, which was on the Gilgit side of the border, else they would regard it as an act of war. Durant reinforced the fort and accelerated the road construction to it, causing Nagar and Hunza to see this as an escalation and so they stopped mail from the British Resident in Chinese Turkmenistan through their territory. British India regarded this as a breach of their 1889 agreement with Hunza, and after an ultimatum was issued and ignored they initiated the Anglo-Brusho Campaign of 1891. Hunza and Nagar came under a British protectorate in 1893.Remoteness and Modernity: Transformation and Continuity in Northern Pakistan By Shafqat Hussain. Yale University Press, New Haven, 2015. p49-53 The forts at Nilt Colonel Algernon George Arnold Durand, commanded a force of approximately a thousand rifles and two guns.Algernon George Arnold Durand, The Making of a Frontier: Five Years' Experiences and Adventures in Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Chitral, and the Eastern Hindu-Kush, (2002), (Adamant Media Corporation) The British gained control of Nagar during a battle at Nilt Nagar (Jangir-e-Laye) in 1891. The fort at Nilt was stormed, and after a fortnight's delay the cliffs beyond it were also carried by assault. Hunza and Nagar were occupied, the chief of Nagar was reinstated on making his submission, and the half- brother of the raja of Hunza was installed as chief in the place of his brother. The British awarded three Victoria Crosses during this campaign.

The east end is where the altar is placed, often within an apse. The fa√ßade and main entrance are accordingly at the west end. The opposite arrangement, in which the church is entered from the east and the sanctuary is at the other end, is called occidentation.Thomas Coomans, Life Inside the Cloister (Leuven University Press 2018), p. 28Noel Lenski, The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine (Cambridge University Press 2006), p. 290Marilyn Stokstad, Medieval Art (Routledge 2018)√âamonn √ì Carrag√°in, Carol Neuman de Vegvar, Roma Felix ‚Äì Formation and Reflections of Medieval Rome (Routledge 2016) Since the eighth century most churches are oriented. Hence, even in the many churches where the altar end is not actually to the east, terms such as \\"east end\\", \\"west door\\", \\"north aisle\\" are commonly used as if the church were oriented, treating the altar end as the liturgical east.\\"East\\" in Curl, James Stephens, Encyclopaedia of Architectural Terms, 1993, Donhead Publishing, , 9781873394045  History  The first Christians faced east when praying. Due to this established custom of theirs, some non-Christians, Tertullian (c. 160 ‚Äî c. 220) says, thought they worshipped the sun.Tertuliano, Apologeticus, 16.9‚Äì10; translation Origen (c. 185 ‚Äî 253) says: \\"The fact that [...] of all the quarters of the heavens, the east is the only direction we turn to when we pour out prayer, the reasons for this, I think, are not easily discovered by anyone.\\"\\"quod ex omnibus coeli plagis ad solam orientis partem conversi orationem fundimus, non facile cuiquam puto ratione compertum\\" (Origenis in Numeros homiliae, Homilia V, 1; translation Later on, various Fathers of the Church advanced mystical reasons for the custom. One such explanation is that Christ's Second Coming was expected to be from the east: \\"For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man\\" (Matthew 24:27, ESV).Michael P. Foley, Why Do Catholics Eat Fish on Friday?: The Catholic Origin to Just About Everything (Palgrave Macmillan 2005), p. 164Uri Ehrlich, The Nonverbal Language of Prayer: A New Approach to Jewish Liturgy (Mohr Siebeck 2004), p. 78 At first, the orientation of the building in which Christians met was unimportant, but after the legalization of the religion in the fourth century, customs developed in this regard.The Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art and Architecture (2013 ), p. 117 These differed in eastern and western Christianity. The Apostolic Constitutions, a work of eastern Christianity written between 375 and 380 AD, gave it as a rule that churches should have the sanctuary (with apse and sacristies) at the east end, to enable Christians to pray eastward in church as in private or in small groups. In the middle of the sanctuary was the altar, behind which was the bishop's throne, flanked by the seats of the presbyters, while the laity were on the opposite side. However, even in the East there were churches (for example, in Tyre, Lebanon) that had the entrance at the east end, and the sanctuary at the west end. During the readings all looked towards the readers, the bishop and presbyters looking westward, the people eastward. The Apostolic Constitutions, like the other documents that speak of the custom of praying towards the east, do not indicate on which side of the altar the bishop stood for \\"the sacrifice\\".Constitutiones Apostolorum II, 57}: ·Ωâ Œø·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ ·ºïœÉœÑœâ ·ºêœÄŒπŒºŒÆŒ∫Œ∑œÇ, Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒª·Ω∞œÇ ·ºêœÄŒπœÑœÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ, ·ºêŒæ ·ºëŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ≠œÅœâŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒºŒµœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºîœáœâŒΩ œÑ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÉœÑŒøœÅŒøœÜŒøœÅŒµ·øñŒ± œÄœÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒªŒÆŒΩ [...

Addis, A Catholic Dictionary (Aeterna Press 1961), article \\"Church: place of Christian assembly\\" The earliest Christian churches in Rome were all built with the entrance to the east, like the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.Helen Dietz, \\"The Eschatological Dimension of Church Architecture\\" Only in the 8th or 9th century did Rome accept the orientation that had become obligatory in the Byzantine Empire and was also generally adopted in the Frankish Empire and elsewhere in northern Europe.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2005 ), p. 525 The original Constantinian Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem also had the altar in the west end.D. Fairchild Ruggles, On Location: Heritage Cities and Sites (Springer 2011 ), p. 134Lawrence Cunningham, John Reich, Lois Fichner-Rathus, Culture and Values: A Survey of the Humanities, Volume 1 (Cengage Learning 2013 ), pp. 208‚Äì210 The old Roman custom of having the altar at the west end and the entrance at the east was sometimes followed as late as the 11th century even in areas under Frankish rule, as seen in Petershausen (Constance), Bamberg Cathedral, Augsburg Cathedral, Regensburg Cathedral, and Hildesheim Cathedral (all in present-day Germany).Heinrich Otte, Handbuch der kirchlichen Kunst-Arch√§ologie des deutschen Mittelalters (Leipzig 1868), p. 12 The importance attached to orientation of churches declined after the 15th century. In his instructions on the building and arrangement of churches, Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan from 1560 to 1584, expressed a preference for having the apse point exactly east, but accepted that, where that is impractical, a church could be built even on a north-south axis, preferably with the fa√ßade at the southern end. He stated that the altar can also be at the west end, where \\"in accordance with the rite of the Church it is customary for Mass to be celebrated at the main altar by a priest facing the people\\".Carlo Borromeo, Instructiones fabricae et suppellectilis ecclesiasticae (Fondazione Memofonte onlus. Studio per l'elaborazione informatica delle fonti storico-artistiche), liber I, cap. X. De cappella maiori (pp. 18‚Äì19) The medieval mendicant orders generally built their churches inside towns and had to fit them into the town plans, regardless of orientation. Later, in the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires they made no attempt to observe orientation, as is seen in San Francisco de Asis Mission Church near Taos, New Mexico. Today in the West, orientation is little observed in building churches.  Inexactitude of orientation  Plan of Quimper Cathedral Charles Borromeo stated that churches ought to be oriented exactly east, in line with the rising sun at the equinoxes, not at the solstices, but some churches seem to be oriented to sunrise on the feast day of their patron saint. Thus St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna is oriented in line with sunrise on St. Stephen's Day, 26 December, in Julian calendar 1137, when it began to be built. However, a survey of old English churches published in 2006 showed practically no relationship with the feast days of the saints to whom they are dedicated. The results also did not conform to a theory that compass readings could have caused the variants. Taken as a body, those churches can only be said to have been oriented approximately but not exactly to the geographical east.Ian Hinton, \\"Churches face East, don't they?\\" in British Archaeology Another survey of a smaller number of English churches examined other possible alignments also and found that, if sunset as well as sunrise is taken into account, the saint's day hypothesis covered 43% of the cases considered, and that there was a significant correspondence also with sunrise on Easter morning of the year of foundation. The results provided no support for the compass readings hypothesis.Jason R. Ali, Peter Cunich, \\"The orientation of churches: Some new evidence\\" in The Antiquaries Journal Yet another study of English churches found that a significant proportion of churches that showed a considerable deviation from true east were constrained by neighbouring buildings in town and perhaps by site topography in rural areas.Peter G. Hoare and Caroline S. Sweet, \\"The orientation of early medieval churches in England\\" in Journal of Historical Geography 26, 2 (2000) 162‚Äì173 Similarly, a survey of a total of 32 medieval churches with reliable metadata in Lower Austria and northern Germany discovered only a few aligned in accordance with the saint's feast, with no general trend. There was no evidence of the use of compasses; and there was a preferred alignment towards true east, with variations due to town and natural topography.Patrick Arneitz, Andrea Draxler, Roman Rauch, Roman Leonhardt, \\"Orientation of churches by magnetic compasses?\\" in Geophysical Journal, Volume 198, Issue 1, p.1-7 A notable example of an (approximately) oriented church building that ‚Äì to match the contours of its location and to avoid an area that was swampy at the time of its construction ‚Äì bends slightly in the middle is Quimper Cathedral in Brittany. Also the modern Coventry Cathedral faces north/south, perpendicular to the old cathedral that was bombed by the Luftwaffe during the blitz. The porch over the main entrance extends over the old wall and, while not connected to the original building does make a nod towards continuity of the structure.

She represented the Brazil women's national football team at three editions of the FIFA Women's World Cup (2003, 2007 and 2011) and three Olympic football tournaments (2004, 2008 and 2012).  Career  She has played as a creative midfielder for Brazil's Botucatu FC since 2005, and was a member of the Brazilian National Teams that won the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics. She is known for her precise passing and goal scoring prowess. In January 2008 Costa signed for Danish Elitedivisionen club OB Odense. Her new coach described her as a strong midfielder with good technique who could score goals and also play in defence. It was reported that Costa's transfer was one of the first involving Brazilian female players to generate a profit for the selling club. On 24 September 2008, Costa's American transfer rights were drafted by the Saint Louis Athletica in the 2008 WPS International Draft. Instead of joining the new American franchise, she accepted a competing offer from LdB FC Malm√∂ of the Swedish Damallsvenskan. LdB FC took over the final year of Costa's Odense contract, paying an undisclosed transfer fee to the Danish club. In January 2014, Russian Top Division club Kubanochka Krasnodar announced the triple signing of Costa and her compatriots Danielli and Amanda Brunner. The club reached the 2014 Russian Women's Cup final, but were beaten 5‚Äì0 by Ryazan-VDV. The Brazilian players were awarded new one-year contracts by Kubanochka in February 2015. Upon her return to Brazil, Costa joined Corinthians, who had reformed in conjunction with Gr√™mio Osasco Audax Esporte Clube and were known as Corinthians Audax. After helping Corinthians Audax to win the 2016 Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino, she signed for ambitious Amazonas-based Iranduba in October 2017. Despite playing as a midfielder at club level, with Brazil she played as a sweeper, notably alongside centre- backs T√¢nia and Aline. Personal life =Car accident= In October 2007, Costa crashed her Opel Corsa into another car at a level crossing. She and front seat passenger Michele suffered minor injuries. Another Botucatu teammate, 16-year-old C√°tia Oliveira, was asleep in the back seat and suffered a spinal cord injury, resulting in paraplegia. Costa was fined $576 for driving without a licence. C√°tia, who had been called up to the Brazil women's national under-17 football team on the day of the accident, later trained as a para table tennis player and represented Brazil at the 2016 Rio Paralympics.

The Fowler house is considered the finest example of a large Gothic Revival residence still standing in the United States. Upon his death in 1889, Fowler had accumulated a fortune of several million dollars. Moses Fowler and his wife Eliza were donors to various community interests including Purdue University. Eliza Fowler Hall (razed) at Purdue University was named in honor of Eliza Fowler. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The house was built by Moses Fowler in 1851-1852. Locally harvested Black Walnut and White Oak were used for the ornately carved woodwork. Italian immigrant craftsmen were brought via the Wabash and Erie Canal from New York City to execute the elaborate decorative plaster work ceilings in the large north and south parlors. When completed it was one of the finest houses in Indiana. The designs for the house were principally taken from a copy of A.J. Downing‚Äôs book The Architecture of Country Houses c.1851 which Moses purchased while on a business trip in New York City. Fowler originally came to Lafayette in 1839 from Circleville, Ohio with his friend and business partner John Purdue (founder of Purdue University) and engaged in the dry goods business. Over the years a number of business pursuits made him very wealthy. These included the wholesale business, cattle ranching, the railroads, and banking, At his death in 1889, Fowler had accumulated a fortune of several million dollars. Following his death, his wife Eliza was a generous donor to various community interests including Purdue University. Eliza Fowler Hall (razed) at Purdue University was named in her honor.[2] In 1902, Moses Fowler's grandson, Cecil G. Fowler, inherited the house and he and his wife Louise made it their residence. Cecil had followed his father and grandfather into banking but was also a developer. He partnered with Carl Fischer (developer of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway) to build the first luxury hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, which opened on New Year's Eve 1920. In 1916-17, the Fowlers moved out of the house while significant renovations and additions were completed. During this time a large Tudor style formal dining room and living room were added, along with an indoor kitchen, laundry, garage, and servants quarters. The upstairs now included seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. These included a new guest bedroom, master suite, and servants bedrooms. Outside, a large Italian style tiered patio with fountains, a reflecting pool, a tea house, and formal gardens were added. The Fowlers loved to entertain and were well known locally for the large and extravagant parties they hosted. In 1940, with their children grown, the Fowlers sold the house to the Tippecanoe County Historical Association. From 1940 until 2015, the Moses Fowler House was the home of the Tippecanoe County Historical Association and used at various times as a museum, offices, and for collections storage. In 2015, The 1852 Foundation (a 501c3 non-profit public charity) was founded through the generosity of Matt and Dr. Ann Jonkman. The 1852 Foundation purchased the Fowler House Mansion and from 2015-2018 completed over $1.3 million in restorations, repairs, code updates, and facility additions in order that the house could be open to and used by the public for tours and as an events venue.

The school's motto is \\"Nid da lle gellir gwell\\" ‚Äî literally, (it is) not good where capable of (being) better, i.e. never settle for second-best; or, there is always room for improvement. The current headmaster is Mr Geoff Evans‚Äì originally from Y Bala in Meirionnydd. The school has a successful rugby team which competes in the Rosslyn Park National School Sevens annually. They were runners up to Millfield School in 2003. The school lost in the semi final the National Urdd Sevens Tournament in 2010. The school's year 8 team won the Urdd National Sevens in 2010 and the same year group also won the under 15s Urdd National Sevens tournament in 2012 and were unbeaten throughout both tournaments. The under 15s also won the Urdd National Sevens tournament in 2013 and were unbeaten in the tournament. In 2013, the school performed an original musical 'Grav' that was based on the life of late rugby star, Ray Gravell. The musical was completely in Welsh and performed by pupils from the school of all ages. It attracted a large audience throughout South Wales; resulting in a shortened version being performed in the National Eisteddfod the following year in Llanelli. The arts department within the school have also achieved many prospects throughout the nation. The choir have featured numerous times on the BBC, with some members also taking part in the Eurovision Choir of the Year competition in 2017.

Plot Jos√© Sirgado (Eusebio Poncela) is a frustrated horror film director and heroin addict in a tumultuous relationship with Ana Turner (Cecilia Roth). The cousin of his ex-girlfriend Marta, Pedro (Will More), sends him a reel of film, an audio cassette, and the key to his apartment despite the fact that the two have only met twice. As Jos√© and Ana listen, the audio cassette narrates the two occasions when the two men met. These occasions are shown in flashback. The first occasion was when Jos√© came with Marta to scout the family's home for a filming location. Pedro, an obsessive maker of homemade films, snorts heroin with Jos√© and asks if he knows how to film time-lapse photography. Pedro shows Jos√© his home movies, which he has never shown to anyone. Later, Jos√©, mails Pedro an interval timer that would control his camera's shutter, shooting at specified intervals. The second occasion the two men met, Jos√© returns with Ana to watch Pedro's films, and Pedro gives Ana a Betty Boop doll that had apparently been hers as a child. Later, Jos√© and Ana, remembering this visit, decide to watch the mysterious reel of film while listening to the rest of the audio cassette. On the tape, Pedro describes his life after receiving the interval timer. Pedro explains that one night after falling asleep he discovered that his camera turned on by itself and filmed him. After developing the film, he discovers a single red frame in which the camera has lost the image of his sleeping. Curious, Pedro allows the camera to film him multiple times as he sleeps, only to discover that the red still frames are growing in number. Pedro discovers that if he does not film himself during sleep, he experiences withdrawal symptoms, similar to heroin withdrawal. Upon waking from these filmed sleeps, Pedro feels revitalized, \\"enraptured\\", and becomes convinced that whatever happens during the red portion of the film is responsible for this feeling. Unsure of what the frames mean, he asks his cousin Marta to watch him as he sleeps. As she watches one of his films, the camera moves on its own to face Marta, who disappears. When he only has one more frame left before the entire film becomes red. Pedro sends the film, his audio instructions, and the key to Jos√©, instructing him to come to his apartment and develop the final film. Jos√© complies, finding the apartment empty, and discovers the film to be entirely red except for one frame of Pedro's face. The image begins to move, with Pedro gesturing towards the bed with a subtle smile, implying that Jos√© should also let the camera film him as he sleeps; the image becomes blurred and then changes into Jos√©'s own face, which makes a similar gesture. The final scene of the film finds Jos√© getting into Pedro's bed to experience the same \\"rapture\\" as his friend.Mira, Alberto. \\"The Dark Heart of the Movida: Vampire Fantasies in Iv√°n Zulueta's Arrebato\\".

It has also been made into a feature film and a play. Two seasons consisting of 12 episodes each were broadcast in the autumn of 1994 and the autumn of 1996. They have since been repeated numerous times. The series was revived for a third season in 2007, and a fourth in 2008. Svensson, Svensson is one of the most successful sitcoms in Swedish television history. During the second season, each episode gathered more than 2.5 million viewers, in a country which at the time had a population of around 8.8 million people. The most watched episode was broadcast on 17 November 1996 and gathered 3,395,000 viewers.MMS HotTop The series centres on the Svensson family who lives in the Vivalla area of √ñrebro. The family consists of the father Gustav (Allan Svensson) who works as mailman, the mother Lena (Suzanne Reuter) who works at a bank, their teenage daughter Lina (Chelsie Bell Dickson) and their son Max (Gabriel Odenhammar). For the revival, Gustav has had to retire from his work at the post office, while Lena works for the local government. Max now works at the bank and Lina (now played by Claudia Galli) has married the conductor John (Felix Engstr√∂m) who brought his daughter Greta (Embla Hjulstr√∂m) into the family. The Svensson surname is one of the most common names in Sweden. It is often used to represent something average, which is illustrated by the word medelsvensson, used about the \\"average Swede\\". Svensson corresponds to Smith in Anglo-Saxon countries. Characters ;Gustav Svensson (played by Allan Svensson) Gustav's main interests are ball games and cartoons, especially The Smurfs and Scooby-Doo. He is a very conservative Social Democrat and he looks upon every change in his life with much suspicion. His biggest idol is Bj√∂rn Borg, who signed the pair of underpants which hangs on the wall in Gustav and Lena's bedroom. His most precious possession is a Volvo 242, his only benefit after 20 years as a mailman. In 1987, he was elected The Mailman of the Year... or at least he joined the dinner party. Gustav is very confused by the choices of occupation that his children Lina and Max make, but he soon learns that it's great to have a son working at the bank. Gustav's favourite foods are lasagna and pizza, especially Hawaii, Capricciosa and Calzone. Allan plays Gustav in all four seasons of the show. ;Lena Svensson (played by Suzanne Reuter) The wife of Gustav and the mother of Max and Lina. Lena is a calm woman who is more open for changes than Gustav. ;Max Svensson (played by Gabriel Odenhammar) The son of Gustav and Lena and the brother of Lina. In the first two seasons of the show, Max was a very cynical and sarcastic boy, which changed as the series progressed into a third and fourth season, due to becoming a grown-up. Despite Gustav hoping that he'd grow up to become a mailman, Max studied economics in college for a few years and got a job at the bank - a late teenage revolt according to Gustav. ;Lina Svensson (played by Chelsie Bell Dickson and Claudia Galli) The daughter of Gustav and Lena and the sister of Max. In the first two seasons, she was a typical teenager, who loved horses but later grew interested in boys, something that Gustav can't understand hence tries to prevent her from seeing boys. In the latter two seasons, she works as a veterinary surgeon and shares her home with her fianc√© John and his daughter Greta. They have bought the house Lena and Gustav used to live in, causing Gustav to buy the house across the street. At the end of season 3, Lena gets pregnant, something that Gustav does not get happy for. In the very last episode, she gives birth to a boy named Sixten. Lina is played by Chelsie Bell Dickson in the first two seasons and the movie, and in the last two seasons, she is played by Claudia Galli. ;John Franz√©n (played by Felix Engstr√∂m) The fianc√© of Lina and the father of Greta. He tries to befriend Gustav, although he has a hard time getting used to John. Gustav is constantly bothered by the thought of Lina marrying John, who has \\"the most dumbest occupation in the world\\" - conducting. ;Greta Franz√©n (played by Embla Hjulstr√∂m) The daughter of John. She gets along well with Gustav, because they share thoughts and they are both very fond of watching cartoons. ;Ebba (played by Ami Camilla Wester) The girlfriend of Max. She does not get much on-screen time. She only appeared in two episodes of season three, and six episodes of season four. Gustav gets along better with Ebba than with John. Sara (played by Charlotte Strandberg) (Season 1, and two episodes of Season 2) The closest female friend of Lena, and is by occupation a hair-dresser. Somewhat air- headed, and very interested in attractive single men. Gustav, on the other hand, treats her in a somewhat snide and condescending manner. He nevertheless makes it clear, when she moves out, that he actually is going to miss her.
