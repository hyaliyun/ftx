The Aalten Synagogue is a synagogue in Aalten, Gelderland, The Netherlands, completed in 1857. The building is a municipal monument. After restorations, the building was reconsecrated in 1986.  History  The first mention of Jewish inhabitants in Aalten dates to the late seventeenth century. Until the French occupation of the Netherlands, the number of Jews in Aalten was limited to four families living. In 1767, the Jews of Aalten opened a synagogue in a former private home. Prior to that time, they attended a home synagogue in Bredevoort. During the mid-nineteenth century, the community grew and in 1857 the present synagogue was opened. The building has a simple layout; the architect is unknown. In 1900, the Jewish community of Bredevoort merged into that of Aalten. During the 1930s, the Jewish population of Aalten increased due to the influx of refugees from Germany. Just over half the Jews of Aalten survived the Second World War by going into hiding; the remainder were deported to extermination camps and murdered there. The population of Aalten offered shelter to a large number of Jewish and non-Jewish people in hiding. At its peak, 2,500 people lived in hiding out of a population of 13,000. The local Reformed community raised money to help them. Two attempts were made during the Second World War to set the synagogue on fire. The interior of the synagogue was destroyed but the Thorah scrolls and ritual objects were hidden in time to be preserved. After the war, there were not enough Jews in Aalten to form an Orthodox minyan, and so the synagogue fell into disuse and disrepair. The building was sold to a non-profit foundation in 1984, who did several restorations to the building and re-consecrated the synagogue in 1986. In 2000, during the 150th anniversary of the synagogue's construction, a plaque was unveiled bearing the names of all the Jews of Aalten who died during the war. In 2005, a new Torah scroll, made in Israel by Josef Giat, was introduced. Today, the synagogue is open for religious services on special occasions and functions more as a museum.

It is a remaster of the first two games in the Tony Hawk's series: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (1999) and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000) which were originally developed by Neversoft. It is the first major game in the series since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 (2015). Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game has become the fastest selling game in the franchise, selling 1 million copies within the first two weeks.  Gameplay  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a remaster of the first two games in the Tony Hawk's series: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (1999) and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000). A skateboarding video game played in a third-person view with a fixed camera, the player must complete objectives, as well as score points by performing tricks to unlock levels to progress through the game. Pro Skater 1 + 2 features tricks introduced in later games such as the revert, spine transfer and wall plant. The player can also create their own skater and skate park with the Create-A-Skater and Create-A-Park modes. The game also includes both local split screen and online multiplayer.  Development  Pro Skater 1 + 2 is the third remaster of the original two games, following Pro Skater 2x by Treyarch in 2001 and Pro Skater HD by Robomodo in 2012. Trying to capitalize on the growing popularity of skateboarding as a sport, the Tony Hawk's series of video games started in 1999 with Pro Skater, which was immediately followed by Pro Skater 2 in 2000. Both games, especially Pro Skater 2, were extremely well received critically and commercially, spawning one of the most commercially successful video game franchises of the 2000s, releasing games on a yearly basis for nearly a decade. However, the original licensing deal between Tony Hawk and Activision expired in 2015 after the release of the poorly reviewed Pro Skater 5, abandoning the franchise for almost five years. Pro Skater 1 + 2 is the first game released by Activision since the aforementioned deal ended, while Hawk partnered with Maple Media to release the independent mobile game Tony Hawk's Skate Jam in 2018.https://toucharcade.com/2018/12/03/tony-hawks-skate-jam-release-date/ On May 12, 2020, Activision announced Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 which was developed by Vicarious Visions using Unreal Engine 4, who previously worked on ports for several Tony Hawk games. According to Vicarious Visions studio head Jen Oneal, the studio obtained Neversoft's original handling code and layered on the code to modernize the handling, as well as consulting with former employees. The team also worked on the level geometry to make sure the player's skating lines were the same from the original games. Further, the team had redone all the art assets for the game's 19 levels to prepare it for 4K resolution but otherwise keep the game familiar to players. Oneal also confirmed that most of the licensed songs from the first two games would return. Three tracks from the original two games are not present, while 37 new tracks have been added. All of the pro skateboarders from the first two games have returned on the remaster, appearing as their current age. The remaster includes several new and younger pro skateboarders; some of which such as Nyjah Huston, Riley Hawk, and Lizzie Armanto had already appeared in the later Tony Hawk games. Jack Black provides his likeness and voice as \\"Officer Dick\\", a playable secret character who was also in the original games. Reception Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN called it a \\"tremendous turnaround\\" from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, and stated that it was \\"difficult to believe that they share even a shred of DNA\\". =Sales= Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has become the fastest-selling game in the franchise, selling 1 million copies in the first two weeks. In the United Kingdom, the game was the biggest launch for the franchise since 2003's Tony Hawk's Underground and was the second biggest launch in the franchise overall.

He was the president of the Ecological Society of America from 1983 to 1984. Biography After secondary education at Germantown Friends School, Evans matriculated at Haverford College and graduated there in 1936 with a bachelor's degree in biology. With a Rhodes Scholarship he was a graduate student in zoology at Oriel College, Oxford from 1936 to 1939, when he graduated with a Ph.D. supervised by Charles Sutherland Elton. Evans's dissertation, published in 1942 in The Journal of Animal Ecology, dealt with small mammal ecology in Bagley Wood. In 1939 he became a Claypole Memorial Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked as a research assistant to the epidemiologist Karl Friedrich Meyer. Evans did fieldwork in California and the Pacific Northwest to study the \\"relationships of vertebrates, ectoparasites, and disease.\\" In 1942 Evans moved to the University of California, Davis to become an assistant zoologist supervised by Tracy I. Storer at the Agricultural Experiment Station. In 1943 the University of California closed the Davis campus so that the U.S. Army Signal Corps could use it for the duration of WW II. In that year he became an instructor in biology at Haverford College, where he trained medical personnel for the U.S. war effort. In 1948 he left Haverford to become an assistant biologist in the Laboratory of Vertebrate Biology directed by Lee R. Dice, as well an assistant professor of zoology at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. There Evans was promoted to full professor in 1959 and retired as professor emeritus in 1982. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1961‚Äì1962 and was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1963. Evans married Rachel Worthington Brooks (1915‚Äì2002) in June 1942. Upon his death he was survived by his widow, four children, and five grandchildren. Evans Old Field From 1948 to 1997 Evans studied community ecology in successional changes in a 7.7 ha old field at the Edwin S. George Reserve in Livingston County, Michigan. This study area came to be known as the \\"Evans Old Field\\" and is one of the world's most intensively studied old fields.

He secured 3rd place (Bronze Medal) in the Art Olympics of the year 1948 for his sculpture Swimmer. His first exhibition was in the year 1921 at the Salon d'Automne, and in the year 1934 he received the Blumenthal prize. Early life Hubert Yencesse entered the school of Fine Arts in Dijon, in 1919. His father, the medallist Ovice Yencesse taught in the same school. Because of this, he met the sculptor Fran√ßois Pompon and became his pupil. He was the father of the sculptor Dodie Yencesse, and the brother of the sculptor Jacques Yencesse. His wife C√©cile Chambelland died in 1999. Speech for the reception Mr. G√©rard Lanvin at the academy of fine arts Biography He exhibited for the first time at the Salon d'Automne in 1921 and received the in 1934. A little earlier, he was called upon to sculpt the left profile of aviator Georges Guynemer, with a view to making a bronze intended to decorate the facade of a monument erected on the military airfield of Ouges-Longvic in memory of the ace of war (monument inaugurated on 25 July 1932). Monument released unscathed from the German occupation and the Allied bombing of 1943‚Äì1944 and still having this bronze signed Yencesse , on which is a bust framed vertically with the inscription \\"Au Captain Guynemer, l ' Aviation \\". Source: Fr√©d√©ric Lafarge, An ace for godfather , Dijon, 2016 (twenty-page notice published by the BA 102 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the came to Dijon from Georges Guynemer).. The purse associated with the prize allows him to settle in his Parisian workshop. He met Aristide Maillol, of which he became a disciple and collaborator until 1936. Like Maillol, Yencesse devoted himself entirely to the representation of the female body. He exhibited in Paris at the Petit Palais in 1935, at the Salon des Tuileries and participated in exhibitions of French sculpture in Amsterdam, Brussels, etc. He also obtained numerous public commissions: he participated in the decorations of the Palais de Chaillot in 1937, produced decorations for the University of Dijon in 1957, sculpted a War Memorial in Belfort in 1948. In 1953, he produced a new Monument to the dead for the city of Le Neubourg (Eure), replacing the old monument sculpted by Paul Landowski destroyed during the war. He taught at the Beaux-Arts de Paris from 1950 to 1970 (C√©sar succeeded him). During these years, he assiduously frequented, charcoal in hand, the dance studios. He finds his art renewed by this influence: The study of dance, he writes, distances the sculptor from conventional and often worn plastic research; he discovers that a volume from the inside, bursting into space, has total plastic value. Hubert Yencesse, \\"From sculpture to dance\\", in Yencesse, La Danse , ArtFrance catalog, 1990. In 1972, the Rodin museum in Paris devoted a retrospective to him. He was received as a member of the Institute on 20 March 1974, at the headquarters of Henri Navarre in the sculpture section of the Academy of Fine Arts.

In the late 1940s, he painted landscape, and in the 1950s he evolved to abstract expressionism, often with architectonic shapes rather than the spontaneous splashes of painters such as Alexandra Luke. In 1952, he studied in Mexico and in 1953, joined Painters Eleven, the group with which he showed his abstract paintings until 1960. His work has a rich colour sense and sometimes it is compared by other members of the group such as Tom Hodgson with that of member Oscar Cah√©n. By 1960, unhappy with his painting, he had turned to sculpture using found materials, then with metals such as welded steel, bronze, and cast aluminum, allowing him to create surface effects using acid. Between 1963 and 1967 he created numerous public sculptures, now installed in Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg. An exhibition of his sculptures was shown at Hart House (now the Justina M. Barnicke Gallery, University of Toronto Art Centre), University of Toronto in 1967. Around 1970, he began teaching art and design at Humber College in Toronto. In 1979, he moved to Port Rowan, near Lake Erie and started to paint again in watercolour and oil. Public artworks Cedars, bronze sculpture installed at the University of Toronto. In 1963 Yarwood installed the nine-metre tall piece Totem at the Winnipeg Airport. Yarwood's 1967 work sans qualification, original commissioned by the distiller Seagrams for Expo 67, is installed at Montreal's Place de la Laurentienne.http://www.patrimoinebati.umontreal.ca/documents/Place_de_la_Laurentienne_BD.pdf Five of Yarwood's public sculptures are installed in Toronto. The 1962 bronze sculpture Cedars is installed in front of the University of Toronto's pharmacy building at 19 Russel St. His 1964 work Horizons, also commissioned by the University of Toronto, is on the facade of Sidney Smith Hall. The 1964 work Coca Cola was commissioned by the Coca-Cola company. Originally installed at the company's 46 Overlea boulevard head office, it was moved in 2015 to the company's Brampton bottling plant. His 1965 cast aluminum work The Crest is installed on the facade of Founders College at York University, North York. In 1968 he produced Pines, a large bronze work commissioned by the Government of Ontario and installed on the lawn of the Macdonald Block at 77 Wellesley Street West.

It was released to streaming services on 14 May 2020 by Sony Music Australia as the lead single from Goodrem's upcoming sixth studio album. The song is a motivational piano- led power ballad about hope and overcoming hardship. Background The song was first teased in an advert for the Nine Network drama Doctor Doctor on 25 April, initially titled \\"Bridge Over Troubled Dreams\\". On 14 May, Goodrem premiered the song during a livestream on Facebook and Instagram, and released it on streaming services immediately after. The song was included as a b-side on the CD edition of Goodrem's follow-up single \\"Paralyzed\\". Reception \\"Keep Climbing\\" was positively received by critics upon its release, with Idolator remarking that the song provides \\"the kind of stripped-back, vocal showcase that Delta has perfected since breaking through with \\"Born To Try\\" and \\"Lost Without You\\" in 2002\\" and that it \\"might just be her best single since \\"Wings\\"\\". Thomas Bleach commented \\"beginning with just simple piano keys, she starts to add layers with strings and soulful melodies that turn into a beautiful gospel moment towards the end of the song where the choir powerfully sings the phrase \\"keep climbing\\"\\", and that \\"the song ripples with perfect waves of emotions that drive the structure and climatically builds to give you a really beautiful and special moment.\\" Videos A lyric video for the song was uploaded to YouTube at the time of release. The video features the lyrics appearing above an aerial shot of a piano, on which Goodrem is playing the piano part for the song. A live performance recorded at the NSW Art Gallery was released on May 23, while a studio recording video was released on June 15.

The summit (marked by a trig pillar) is above sea level. The north west side of the hill (and most of Combs Moss and Black Edge) is designated as \\"open access\\" land for the public, following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Corbar Cross was a gift from the Duke of Devonshire to Buxton Catholics, who erected it at the summit in 1950 to mark the Holy Year declared by Pope Pius XII. The cross was painted pink as a prank in the 1990s. Protesters against Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the UK in 2010 cut down the cross. A replacement solid oak cross was donated by a firm in Lancashire and installed in 2011. Bluebells in Corbar Woods Corbar Woods is Buxton's oldest woodland and is included in Buxton's \\"The Park\\" conservation area. Its 54 acres are owned and managed by the Buxton Civic Association. The woods were used for coppicing trees in medieval times. There are remains of a white coal pit, which used dried coppice branches to generate the high temperatures needed to smelt lead. The 19th-century paths through the ancient woods, known as the Victorian Swiss Walks, were designed by Joseph Paxton (who also laid out the original Buxton Pavilion Gardens). These paths allowed visitors to the spa town to enjoy views over Buxton's fine buildings from the hilltop. The \\"Ring of Trees\\" waymarked walk around Buxton runs through Corbar Wood. The main tree species are beech, yew and oak. The woodland floor at the higher west end of the woods is covered with swathes of bluebells each May. The woods are habitat to common birds (such as thrushes, tits and finches) but are also home to nuthatches and woodpeckers.

It was built in the 19th century in the style of a French ch√¢teau (with a mansard roof and fountain), apparently for the Ryder family. It later became John Duncan School, which closed in 2003. It has now been converted into private apartments. Corbar Hill Hydro was converted from the Clarendon guest house in the 1890s to offer hydropathic treatments. It was sold in the 1930s for nurses' accommodation.

He was well known for being one of the main responsible for the repression of the Asturian Revolution of 1934, in which he used brutal methods that were denounced to the government of Alejandro Lerroux. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936-1939 he joined the side of the rebels and in May 1937 he was appointed by Francisco Franco as Head of Security at the Generalist Headquarters in Salamanca.  Career in the Civil Guard  He was born in a small village in the province of La Coru√±a in 1888. When he was a child, he met Francisco Franco, who was four years younger than him, in El Ferrol and later they met at the Infantry Academy in Toledo. He joined the Civil Guard as an officer and served in Oviedo from 1917 to 1922. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, he was nominated as a captain and was appointed as head of the garrison in Gij√≥n, where he stayed from 1926 to 1931. During this period he stood out for the harshness with which he repressed strikes and demonstrations by the Republican and workers' left. During General Berenguer's \\"Dictablanda\\" he led the repression in Gij√≥n of the general strike called for December 15, 1930 by the Republican-Socialist \\"revolutionary committee\\" that emerged from the San Sebasti√°n Pact. That day a worker was killed and another wounded as a result of shots fired from a Jesuit building. Captain Doval ordered a cavalry charge against the workers and later authorized the beating of the strikers to denounce their leaders. In April 1931 he resorted to the use of machine guns to repel an attack on his barracks. The new Republican Town Hall of Gij√≥n, constituted after the municipal elections of 12th April 1931, tried to start a process of purging the responsibilities for the actions carried out by Captain Doval and the Civil Guards under his orders. When Doval found out about the City Council's intentions, he wrote a long exculpatory letter that was published in the newspapers El Comercio and La Prensa. The following day, several letters appeared in the newspaper El Noroeste to the director of lawyers and people detained by Doval, in which they denounced the torture and ill-treatment they had been subjected to or had become aware of. He participated in General Sanjurjo's failed coup d'√©tat of August 1932, for which he was suspended, but benefited from the amnesty granted by the radical government of Alejandro Lerroux, supported by the CEDA of Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil Robles, on 24 April 1934.1 He was chosen by Gil Robles to train the paramilitary squads of the Juventudes de Acci√≥n Popular (JAP), the youth branch of the CEDA. On 19 September 1934 he was assigned to Tetu√°n.  Spanish Civil War  When the coup d'√©tat took place in July 1936, Major Doval led a column from Salamanca that advanced on √Åvila to occupy the villages near the mountains and enter Madrid, but his column was dissolved when it was defeated by the loyal forces coming from Madrid under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Julio Mangada. In those operations also participated the leader of the Spanish Falange, On√©simo Redondo, who led the Falangist militias. Redondo died on July 24th in the Segovia town of Labajos. When the news reached the Falangist militias composed of On√©simo Redondo's followers ready to avenge his death, supported by a military unit under the command of commander Doval, he went to Salamanca where he carried out the repression of the leftists who had already been arrested. Many of them were taken out of their cells by the Falangists and executed. Among them were the city's mayor, Casto Prieto Carrasco, professor of radiology at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Salamanca, and the socialist deputy Jos√© Andr√©s Manso. On May 14, 1937, he was appointed by Franco as Head of Security of the residence and headquarters of the Generalissimo in Salamanca, taking command of \\"the European and Moroccan forces in charge of the H.E. guard\\". Once the civil war was over, he presided over the war councils against the defeated in Tortosa. In two trials held on 10 August 1939, involving 14 and 15 men respectively, the defendants were only able to speak to the military man appointed as defence counsel on the day of the trial, and the whole process did not last half an hour. Around 1953 he retired with the rank of general of the Guardia Civil. He died 22 years later at the age of 87 at the Gomez Ulla Military Hospital in Madrid on October 15, 1975, one month before the death of Franco.

She described over a dozen new species of fleas infesting hosts from North and South American.

From 1959-1963, Johnson worked at the Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies in Panama and studied the epidemiology of leishmaniasis. At the same time, she published further work on the taxonomy of lice and fleas.  Pathology of invertebrates  In 1964 Johnson went to the University of California in Irvine as a pathobiologist. Since there was no laboratory space available at the beginning of her work, she created a bibliography on the pathology of invertebrates (non-insects) over a period of several years. Her own publications from this period dealt with the pathology of marine mussels, echinoderms and numerous other invertebrate taxa. In 1970 Johnson moved to the California Institute of Technology and in 1971 to the Division of Environmental Studies, now the Smithsonian Institution Environmental Research Center, in Edgewater, Maryland. From 1972 onwards, Johnson's last scientific station was the National Marine Fisheries Laboratory in Oxford, Maryland. There, until she retired in 1987, she researched exclusively the anatomy, pathology and pathogens of aquatic crustaceans. Johnson's key research findings include descriptions of several viruses that cause diseases in the economically important blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Of eight pathogenic viruses of this type of crab that were discovered by 2003, seven were either described by Johnson herself, or the description was based on her research. In addition, Johnson made important contributions to other blue crab diseases, namely bacterial and unicellular infections, which are exacerbated by stress during trapping and subsequent storage. She compiled her work in the 1980 publication 'Histology of the blue crab, C. sapidus' Johnson's last publications in the 1980s dealt with parasites and pathogens of economically important crustaceans, lobsters, king crabs, shrimps and others.  Awards and honors  Johnson was the first female vice president and president of the Society of Invertebrate Pathology (1978-1982). Honors include award of the City of Montpellier Medal for contributions to the study of marine invertebrate pathology and the US Department of Commerce Bronze Medal (1981).

Personal life Peter de Polnay was born to Jen≈ë Polnay (born Pollacsek) and Marguerite de Tiszasuly on 8 March 1906. His father was director of the Atlantica Shipping Company and the family name was nobilized to de Polnay in recognition of his service to the Hapsburg monarchy. His father later served briefly as Minister of Food Distribution in the Friedrich government in August 1919, then traveled to the United States in 1921 as a trade emissary of the Horthy regime. His father served as the president of the National Association of Hungarian Jews and during World War Two, ran the Budapest Kindergarten Association, an orphanage, and was responsible for saving the lives of nearly 400 children from the Gestapo in 1944. Peter de Polnay and his siblings were largely raised and educated by various governesses and spent time in Switzerland and Italy. He became fluent in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. He never acknowledged being able to speak Hungarian. He converted to Catholicism as a young man and never acknowledged his Jewish origin. This was one of a number of facts he omitted or changed in his autobiography My Road (1978). He also claimed to have spent four years in Devonshire as a child and omitted mention of a second sister, Emily, as well as of his son Gregory. In January 1926, he was arrested for his involvement in a conspiracy organized by Prince Ludwig Windisch-Graetz to forge 30 million in French franc notes. He was released after a few days without explanation. In 1927, he sailed from Bremen to Buenos Aires aboard the German liner Madrid. He joined his younger brother Ivan in Argentina and the two travelled and took a variety of jobs, usually ill-paid and short-lived, an experience he later wrote about in Fools of Choice (1955). He returned to Hungary in 1930 to collect an inheritance of 160,000 Hungarian peng≈ë. He then travelled to England, bought a red Bentley, drove to the French Riviera, and quickly lost his fortune gambling at the Monte Carlo Casino as he later described in A Door Ajar (1959). He then sailed to Kenya, where he tried and failed at running a chicken farm. While in Kenya, he began what would become his first novel Angry Man's Tale, drawing on his experiences on the Riviera. He left Kenya in 1934, spent the winter on Mallorca, then traveled to Paris, where he finished the book. While living in Paris, he became acquainted with the painter Maurice Utrillo, whose biography he would later write, as well as the novelist Marcel Aym√©. Angry Man's Tale was published in both England and the United States in the fall of 1938. His U.S. publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, took out an ad in Saturday Review in which he proclaimed that \\"I like this book uncommonly well and want you to share my discovery of this new talent.\\" De Polnay was in Paris when the German Army occupied the city in June 1940. He spent the next four months before arranging to travel to Vichy France, from which he hoped to escape to England. He was arrested in Marseilles on suspicion of passing funds to supporters of the Free France. He was released for lack of evidence and was able to make his way over the Pyrenees to Spain. He was then able to reach Gibraltar and sail for England, arriving in August 1941.In England, he enlisted in the British Army and was put into the Royal Pioneer Corps. He wrote the account of his experiences under German occupation and his escape, which was published in 1942 as Death and Tomorrow. The book was a best-seller in both England and the U.S.. L. P. Hartley wrote of it, \\"The story of the fall of France has been told many times, though never more vividly than it is here.\\" Shortly before the book was published, he married Margaret Mitchell Banks, the daughter of a former King's Counsel Sir Reginald Mitchell Banks and former wife of the photographer Norman Parkinson. Their son Gregory was born in 1943. After the war, de Polnay and his wife rented Boulge Hall, formerly the home of the poet and translator Edward FitzGerald. He told his friend Cyril Connolly that his dream was \\"to live in Suffolk and shoot.\\" Although the house proved unaffordable after two years, de Polnay later wrote his first biography, Into an Old Room, about the poet and the manor house. They then left Gregory, who spent most of his childhood in boarding schools, in the care of another family and traveled to Cyprus. Margaret de Polnay designed the covers for most of her husband's books published immediately after the war. She died in 1950. De Polnay then spent several years traveling in Portugal and Spain, where he became friends with the novelist John Lodwick. He married Elaine Daphne Tasker in 1952 but the marriage ended in divorce less than two years later. In 1955 he married Maria del Carmen Rubio y Caparo, daughter of a Spanish theater director and the Spanish-Catalan actress Angela Rubio y Caparo. In 1957, the couple moved to England, where they lived for the next eight years in Hastings and St Leonards-on-Sea. De Polnay later wrote that he chose these towns for their proximity to London and \\"to keep me writing, for without writing the days would have been too long.\\" During this period, they traveled each year to France, remaining longer and longer, often house-sitting for Nancy Mitford in Versailles during her own holidays. Finally, in 1965, they moved permanently to France. They took an apartment in a hotel on the Boulevard Saint-Germain that would be their primary residence until de Polnay's death. De Polnay became increasingly devout in his last two decades and Catholic themes of guilt and confession play a larger role in his later novels. De Polnay died on 21 November 1984 in Paris. Writing career Although de Polnay began his first novel on a bet, writing soon became his profession and main source of income. He wrote at a feverish pace, completing forty novels in just forty-five years. After the war, he settled into a fairly predictable pattern of finishing one book in time for the summer holidays and another just ahead of the Christmas season. His first dozen novels were consistently reviewed, and generally favorably, in major magazines. Of his 1947 novel The Umbrella Thorns, which drew upon his experiences in Kenya, Hamilton Basso wrote in The New Yorker, \\"Mr. de Polnay's characters are grown- up men and women who have gone through a good deal of battering in the process of living their lives, but they refuse to take refuge in those adolescent inclinations, sentiments, and emotions which make so make so many 'serious' novels read as if they had been written by melancholy sophomores.\\" On the other hand, de Polnay was often criticized for writing in haste. Isabel Quigly wrote that his 1973 novel The Moon and the Marabou Stork \\"gives the impression of having been written on the backs of old envelopes and posted off without correction or arrangement.\\" In the same year, Christopher Wordsworth wrote of The Price You Pay that \\"Mr. de Polnay's stringent control of the tricks of his trade can't disguise the flimsyness of this novel.\\" He retained, however, a cadre of supporters. Anthony Burgess once wrote that \\"Because Mr. de Polnay is prolific, some people will not take him seriously. This is a dangerous mistake.\\" Norman Shrapnel, who reviewed over a dozen of de Polnay's books, wrote that \\"Reading Peter de Polnay must for many have become a kind of habit -- a good one, I'd say, since he makes professionalism in fiction a decent word.... His work is so unobtrusively crafted that it is easy to miss the extraordinary nature of a routine de Polnay achievement.\\" And shortly before de Polnay's death in 1984, Auberon Waugh wrote (with a slight exaggeration of the length of his career) that \\"For over 50 years he has been turning out funny, intelligent and original novels, always with unusual plots and unexpected characters, beautifully written and constructed, highly polished yet never precious or affected.\\" Orville Prescott may have made the most balanced assessment of de Polnay's work in his review of the 1948 novel The Moot Point:  Works  ;Novels * Angry Man‚Äôs Tale, Secker & Warburg (1938), Knopf (1939), revised edition, Hutchinson (1947) * Children, My Children!, Secker & Warburg (1939) * Boo, Seeker & Warburg (1941), published as The Magnificent Idiot, Doubleday (1942) * Water on the Steps, Seeker & Warburg (1943) * Two Mirrors, Constable (1944), Creative Age Press (1946) * A Letter to an Undertaker, Home & Van Thal (1946) * The Umbrella Thorn, Hutchinson (1946), Creative Age Press (1947) * A Pin‚Äôs Fee, Hutchinson (1947) * The Fat of the Land, Hutchinson (1948) * The Moot Point, Creative Age Press (1948) * Out of the Square, Creative Age Press (1949) * Somebody Must, Hutchinson (1949) * The Next Two Years, Hamish Hamilton (1951) * A Beast in View, W.

It was constructed in the 15th century after the village became a parish, and it was enlarged and embellished a number of times in the 16th and 17th centuries. The building was abandoned and partially demolished after a new parish church with the same dedication was built elsewhere in the village in the late 17th century. The ruins were abandoned and used for agricultural purposes until they were restored in 2007. History Remains of the statues of St Nicholas and St Paul The village of Siƒ°ƒ°iewi was recognised as a parish in 1436. The old church is believed to have been built soon afterwards in the 15th century. During a 1575 visit, Pietro Dusina mentioned that the church had two lateral altars, two small naves, a sacristy and a baptistery near the main door. A small church dedicated to the Visitation of Our Lady was located adjacent to the old parish church, while other churches dedicated to Saint Sebastian and Saint Michael were also found in the vicinity. The old parish church seems to have been enlarged in the 16th century, and in 1585 the church of the Visitation was demolished and its masonry was reused within the parish church. Bishop Tom√°s Gargallo visited the church in 1594 and at this point it had five altars. It was enlarged further in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and by this point the church acquired a cruciform plan. When Bishop Baldassare Cagliares visited the church in 1625, it had seven altars. The church's northern transept was decorated in the Baroque style in the early 17th century. A cemetery was also located near the church. Structural damage was noticed in the church in the late 17th century, and in 1676 the population of Siƒ°ƒ°iewi decided to construct a new parish church in another part of the village. The nave of this church was blessed in 1682 and it was completed in 1693. The old church was abandoned, and in the late 17th century Bishop Davide Cocco Palmieri ordered its demolition. The roof was demolished and a boundary wall was built around it to prevent people from entering the site. Despite this, significant parts of the church including parts of the northern and southern transepts, a wall along the nave and its original flagstone floor still survived, as did a number of decorative architectural elements. Ruins The sacristy in Triq il-Knisja l-Qadima The site of the old parish church remained the property of the ecclesiastical authorities. The ruins were eventually neglected and used for agricultural purposes, with parts of the structure being buried under soil. An orchard with fruit trees and prickly pears was established on the site. Part of the sacristy was converted into a dwelling, and it did not fall into ruin like the rest of the church. A stone cross known as is-Salib tad-Dejma was built nearby, probably to mark the location of the former church, and a niche with a relief of Saint Mary and souls was installed above a doorway leading to the ruins. In the 19th century, the artist Giuseppe Hyzler made some sketches of frescoes found in the ruined church, and a number of early 20th century photographs of the ruins also exist. The street in which the church was located became known as Triq il- Knisja l-Qadima (Maltese for Old Church Street). The church ruins were scheduled with Grade 1 protection in 1998, and the sacristy was given the same protection in 2010. In 2006 and 2007, the ruins of the church were restored by the Restoration Unit of the Ministry for Resources and Infrastructure. The works were carried out by the architect Norbert Gatt, and lasted for ten months. Archaeological excavations were also carried out at this point. The project was awarded a Silver Medal Trophy and Prix d'Honneur for restoration and conservation by Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa in 2008. In 2018 plans were made to allow construction of three-story buildings adjacent to the ruined church. These were met with objections by the Siƒ°ƒ°iewi local council and NGOs.

Biography  In the first stage of her studies, she studied mostly in Germany, firstly at the University of T√ºbingen, then at Heidelberg, where she was the last student of Gadamer. She worked there on phenomenology and philosophical hermeneutics. She offered an original perspective of these two disciplines, which is close to Jacques Derrida‚Äôs deconstruction. Those studies would have been included in many essays published subsequently and two books: Utopia of Understanding, Suny Press, Albany 2013. Gadamer, Indiana University Press, Bloomington 2013. After the publication of Martin Heidegger‚Äôs Schwarze Hefte, she had been working on philosophy's responsibility for the extermination with the book Heidegger and the Jews: The Black Notebooks, Polity Press, Cambridge ‚Äì Boston 2018. The question about the violence and the human condition victim of extreme violence was an ulterior step in her research. Hence, this more recent field of research is developed thoroughly in the volume Torture, Polity Press, Cambridge ‚Äì Boston 2018. The political and ethical questions in the era of globalisation have pushed her to investigate the current phenomenon of terror, the dark side of the global civil war. She published Terror and Modernity, Polity Press, Cambridge ‚Äì Boston 2019. In 2017 it can be observed a political turn in the development of her thought, when she resumed the sovereignty‚Äôs theme, previously addressed in the essays dedicated to Spinoza‚Äôs political theology.

The story is about Yoo- jin who returns home after going missing 25 years ago. As their family gradually begins to change after her return, her older brother Seo-jin grows suspicious and seeks to uncover his sister's secret, which leads him to a shocking truth.

Stricken with the grief of not finding the responsible driver for his wife's death, he struggles to manage his work and taking care of his daughter. The film begins with his hypnosis therapy scene, which takes him back to the day of the accident, but his memories soon get mingled with his childhood memories where he finds himself next to a man selling balloons in a children's park, and he finds a little girl standing in the distance. The moment he tries to look at the girl's face, he wakes up. After returning home, his parents tell him to take good care of his daughter Ye-na(Park Min-ha), who still doesn't know about her mother's death and not just keep himself busy with work all the time. The next day at work, Seo jin gets a call from Seoul Emmanuel Orphanage, who claims that his long last sister was found after 25 years. He then goes to meet his found sister, Kang Yoo-jin(Song Ji-hyo), and both of them don't seem to have clear memories about what happened on the day of her abduction. Their parents and they go to the hospital where Yoo-jin works to retrieve her things back. There they meet a fellow nurse, Yeon-joo(Jang Sung-yoon), who tells them that Yoo-jin is the ace of her co-workers. After a couple of days, Ye-na gets close to her aunt and follows everything her aunt tells her to do. Soon Yoo-jin gets close to the whole family. She changes their house's infrastructure and hires new workers to work at home and help with their mother's rehabilitation. His parents and daughter don't act the same with him anymore and listen to whatever Yoo-jin says. All this doesn't make sense to Seo-jin, and he begins to doubt if Yoo- jin is really his lost sister. Seo-jin gets a call from the police that they were able to find new evidence in his wife's accident. He notices his sister in the evidence while watching it. This makes him grow even more suspicious of her identity. He consults his psychiatrist friend and asks him to perform hypnotism on him again. This time he sees the face of the driver who hit his wife and also sees his sister watching from a distance. To find about Yoo- jin's true identity, Seo-jin goes to the orphanage who call him earlier. But he doesn't find any orphanage in that address. At the same time, he finds out that Yeon-joo was hired by Yoo-jin to tell her family about her being a nurse. Enraged by this, he reaches home and reveals this fact to his family. Yoo-jin then apologizes that she lied about being a nurse as she wanted to create a good impression on her in the family. After an argument, their mother faints and is taken to hospital where Seo-jin manages to get a strand of Yoo-jin's hair. He takes the sample to get a DNA analysis. After a series of incidents, Seo-jin becomes sure that Yoo-jin is an intruder. One night Seo-jin gets a call from a realtor that there is someone in his old home. When he goes to his old house, he finds Yeon-joo's dead body in the bathtub and faints. After becoming conscious, he finds himself tied up to a chair by a man he sees in his hypnosis, the one who killed his wife. He tells Seo-jin that he was the one who called him earlier from the orphanage and is also the one who killed his wife, which he claims to be unintentional. He tells Seo-jin that theirs is a religious group where they worship \\"The Chosen Holy Child.\\" For this, they abduct girls of similar age and perform certain rituals on the child and make their believers worship the child. Now the chosen child is Ye-na. Angry, Seo- jin kills him and comes back home only to find police waiting for him. A series of incidents make the police and Seo-jin's friend believe that Seo-jin is behaving wild because of his medication. They arrest Seo-jin, and Yoo-jin confesses in a car privately to him. She tells about how she met his wife and made her join their cult. She blames him for being a workaholic and neglecting his family. Seo-jin laters manages to flee from the police and involves in hustle with Yoo-jin when she tries to escape with Ye-na. Seo-jin holds Yoo- jin's hand as she was about to fall off a cliff. She pleads him not to leave her hand as their mother told him not to let go of her hand.

Background In 1800, most likely August or September, by his own account, Hogg had time on his hands during a trip to Edinburgh to sell sheep. Aware of his poetic gift‚Äîthough only one poem of his had so far appeared in print, in The Scots Magazine for 1794‚Äîhe found a printer's shop next to the market, wrote out 'a poem or two' from memory, and had them printed as a 62-page booklet.'Memoir of the Life of James Hogg', in James Hogg, The Mountain Bard, ed. Suzanne Gilbert (Edinburgh, 2007), 15. Hogg's Memoir was published in 1807, but his account of the origin of Scottish Pastorals dates back at least to 1805: ibid., 134‚Äí35, 393‚Äí94. This may be a true recollection, though Hogg had showed a manuscript of the collection to friends before it was published.The Collected Letters of James Hogg: Volume 1 1800‚Äí1819, ed.

In his Memoir Hogg himself dismissed it as a vanity publication.The Mountain Bard, 15. Its merits have received recognition, however, in the later 20th and early 21st centuries. In the most detailed discussion, Elaine Petrie in her edition of 1988 praises 'the raw life and vitality that prevent it from ever becoming a precious little collection of derivative verse' and asserts that 'Hogg's confident use of Scots imbues his subjects with dignity and integrity'.James Hogg, Scottish Pastorals, ed. Elaine Petrie (Stirling, 1988), xiv‚Äíxv. Petrie's recognition of the 'vigour' and 'candour' of the collection was endorsed in 2003 by Karl Miller.Karl Miller, Electric Shepherd: A Likeness of James Hogg (London, 2003), 23. Four years later, Valentina Bold responded more equivocally, finding the collection at times 'laboured' and 'insipid', but discerning 'a subtle mix of oral and artsong elements' and an ability simultaneously to adopt and subvert established forms which was to be developed richly in Hogg's subsequent works.Valentina Bold, James Hogg: A Bard of Nature's Making (Bern, 2008), 88‚Äí90, 107‚Äí08.

Description It is a very small species with a variable shell height (on average ca. 1.2 mm) and an average shell width of 0.80 ‚Äì 0.87 mm. The shell is transparent and has an elongate or elongate-conical shape with an entire, roundish and more or less thickened peristome. The peristome is closely adhering to the spire, reflected and takes up ca. 40% of the shell height. The shell has about five convex, regularly coiled whorls, which are more or less strongly shouldered, especially in the more conical shells. The shell shows a deep suture. The opening (aperture) is more or less of a circular shape. This species lacks obvious apertural barriers, but often an obsolete lamella (denticle) in the parieto-columellar corner can be seen. The central column of the shell (columella) possesses a single, low annular lamella.Jochum, A., De Winter, A. J., Weigand, A. M., G√≥mez, B., & Prieto, C. (2015). Two new species of Zospeum Bourguignat, 1856 from the Basque-Cantabrian Mountains, Northern Spain (Eupulmonata, Ellobioidea, Carychiidae). ZooKeys, (483), 81. Distribution Zospeum vasconicum shells were collected by various workers from caves in the Sierra de Aitzgorri and the adjacent Sierra de Aramotz-Anboto in the Provinces of Gipuzkoa and Bizkaia in Northern Spain. Live individuals were encountered in the Cueva Arrikrutz. Populations of Zospeum vasconicum were found in the Cueva de la Ermita de Sandaili (at an altitude of 400 m), the Cueva de Otxas (at an altitude of 500 m), the Cueva Silibranka-2 (at an altitude of 220 m) and the Cueva del Cran√©o (at an altitude of 400 m). Etymology The species Zospeum vasconicum is named after the pre-Roman Era Vascones Tribe (from Latin gens Vasconum), which at the arrival of the Romans during the 1st century, inhabited a territory spanning the region between the upper course of the Ebro River and the southern basin of the western Pyrenees. Ecology Zospeum vasconicum were discovered on moist, muddy walls in karst caves at a maximum depth of 400m . They were identified on densely perforated mats of fine mud lining the walls of the upper level of the cave. Near this population, transculent Zospeum shells were found embedded in a thick, uniform layer of mud, superficially interspersed with yellow, clumped strands of fungal aggregations . Conservation Jochum et al. (2015) suggest that the species is not immediately threatened. They found fresh empty shells in relative abundance at various spots in the caves, where Zospsum vasconicum occur. On a global scale the distribution is likely limited to less than 5 caves within a radius of less than 20 km2..

As chief of staff of the army, Mitrofanov was evaluated as having \\"taken an active role in the planning of army operations, ensuring unbroken command and control of forces in accordance with the decisions of the army commander,\\" and \\"displaying excellent staff education and knowledge of operational art.\\" He became army deputy commander in May 1944 and took command of the army's 7th Guards Tank Corps in July after its commander was wounded. Mitrofanov led the corps in successful attacks during the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive, in which it captured Gorodok and Lvov, and fought in battles for the Sandomierz bridgehead. For its courage and skill in these battles, his corps was awarded the Order of Suvorov. Appointed commander of the 6th Guards Tank Corps (the former 12th Tank Corps) of the army in January 1945, Mitrofanov led it in the breakout from the Sandomierz bridgehead during the Sandomierz‚ÄìSilesian Offensive. The corps advanced in the operation and went on to fight in the Berlin Offensive. In April, during the latter, Mitrofanov, leading from the front, commanded the corps in its breakthrough of the German defenses on the Neisse and the fortified point of Gross Bademeisel, south of Forst, and the crossing of the Spree. The corps then crossed the Teltow Canal and advanced into the city of Berlin from the south. For his actions, Mitrofanov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 29 May 1945, while the corps received the name of Berlin as an honorific. At the end of the war, the corps participated in the defeat of the German troops at Dresden and in the Prague Offensive reached Prague.

While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Cambridge University at Lord's in The University Match of 1845. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for 12 runs in the Oxford first innings by Stephen Rippingall, while in their second innings he was dismissed by the same bowler without scoring. A student of Lincoln's Inn, he was called to the bar in 1848 and completed his Doctor of Canon Law in 1850, with Hughes practicing as a barrister in the ecclesiastical courts. His brother, Thomas Hughes, wrote the book Tom Brown's School Days in 1857, and likely based the main character Tom Brown on Hughes during his time at Rugby and later Oxford in the sequel novel Tom Brown at Oxford, though the clergyman Augustus Orlebar could also have been the basis for the character.

The hotel was listed on the Western Australian State Register of Heritage Places in 2008 but de-listed in 2011. It remains on the City of Rockingham heritage list however. History First surveyed in 1847, Rockingham did not see any major development until 1872, when a jetty was built to export jarrah timber from Jarrahdale through the Rockingham port. During its peak, from 1878 to 1883, Rockingham accounted for more than half of Western Australia's timber exports. By 1903, timber exports from Rockingham had ceased, and the town became a holiday destination. The location of the future Rockingham Hotel, Rockingham Town Lot 12, was acquired by Daniel Hymus in 1875. Hymus, like his wife Fanny Bell, came from one of the earliest settler families in the Rockingham area. Western (beach) side of the Rockingham Hotel with one of the heritage listed Norfolk Island pines on the left Originally named the Port Hotel, it is believed to have been built by James Bell Junior, the brother of Fanny. The original building was single-story and made from timber. The new hotel was built on a slope, facing the sea, with steps leading up to the bar. The current building dates back to 1898, when Daniel and Fanny Hymus had a two-storey stone building constructed in front of the old one on what is now Kent Street. From 1918, the hotel was leased to L.D. Hicks, who renamed it to Peron Hotel, after the local Cape Peron. Reginald Harrison, owner of Perth's Criterion Hotel, purchased the hotel in 1922, after a period of decline for Rockingham following the port closure 18 years earlier. In the early post-war years, the Rockingham Hotel benefited from improved accessibility for tourists from Perth through the use of cars and from its distance from the city, which permitted it to remain open for drinking on Sundays, something banned in the city. Harrison developed the hotel into a fashionable seaside resort, popular for its beaches, fishing and drinking. He had the building and its surrounds altered and expanded, the hotel now having the appearance of a Federation Arts and Crafts style building. Harrison sold Rockingham Hotel to his friend George Grigg in 1925. Grigg also expanded the place, on the southern side, thereby increasing both the bar and the number of bedrooms. Alterations were also made to the Kent Street side of the building, giving it a two-storey verandah with a central gable. The hotel was also the site of the first petrol pump installed in Rockingham in the 1920s. The hotel enjoyed great popularity at the time, being booked out during the summer months. Plans in the 1930s for a new hotel by Grigg and his son Reg where stalled by licensing regulations, therefore the existing facility was renovated instead, with the hotel now designed in the Inter-War Functionalist style. Grigg did have a new place constructed in 1933 but could not obtain a licence because of its proximity to the existing hotel, and the new facility became The Trocadero, a dance hall, among other things. The Trocadero, north-west of the hotel in what is now the car park, was demolished in 2009. In late 1952, a beer garden was added to the hotel, which was now the social hub of Rockingham, together with The Trocadero. Further alterations to the hotel were made in 1957, and the verandahs on the Kent Street side were removed in 1967. The dining room of the hotel was enlarged around 1989 and an outdoor dining area was added on the beach side of the building. The hotel was offered for sale in 2019, with the 1.15 hectare site valued at A$20 million. Heritage listing The Rockingham Hotel was added to the State Register of Heritage Places in 2008 for the interim but removed from the register in 2011 when this listing expired without becoming permanent. Among the reasons for its listing were the fact that the hotel is the last remnant of a once substantial seaside resort. The four Norfolk Island pines and stone wall, north and north-east of the building, are also heritage listed and are the last remnants of the once popular beer garden. Despite the recommendation by the Western Australian Heritage Council to make the hotel's listing permanent, the decision was made by Heritage Minister John Castrilli to reject this.

She served until 1719, and took part in the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì1697) and the War of Spanish Succession (1702‚Äì1714).  Career  = Nine Years' War = Brillant entered service one year into the war with England and Holland, and started taking part in operations under Captain de Beaujeu. She was part of the squadron under Tourville that departed Brest on 23 June 1690, leading to the Batte of Beachy Head on 10 July. Brillant held the 29th position in the French line of battle. In 1692, De Combes took command of Brillant and she took part in Tourville's operation to cover an invasion of England from 12 May..

In August 1705, she was attached to an 11-ship squadron under Iberville, for an expedition against New England, New York and Newfoundland.. The force left in two separate divisions that were to join up in the Caribbean. Brillant, under comte de Choiseuil, was part of the first division, under comte de Chavagnac, with five ships and one frigate, bound for MartiniqueLes autres vaisseaux √©taient le Glorieux (64 canons), l'Apollon (56), le Fid√®le (58) le petit vaisseau le Ludlow (30) et la fr√©gate la Nymphe (26). . The armament of Brillant was improved to 64 guns (twenty-six 24-pounder long guns, twenty-six 12-pounders, and twelve 6-poundersTableau de la flotte fran√ßaise en 1706, d'apr√®s .). In February 1706, Choiseul attacked Saint Kitts, without waiting to join with Chavagnac. He managed to raid and loot the island, but not to destroy its forts. He then returned to Martinique, where he found Iberville, who had arrived on 7 March with the second division, which comprised four ships-of the-line and one frigate.Le Juste (60 canons), le Ph√©nix (60), le Prince (56), Aigle (34) et la fr√©gate Milfort (30). Il y avait aussi des fl√ªtes, des brigantins, des corsaires. . Iberville decided to mount an attack against Nevis. Brillant took positionin front of one of the forts and bombarded it as a diversion, while Iberville conducted a nighttime landing on the rear of the British defences, defeating them on 4 April.Vingt- deux b√¢timents arm√©s en guerre ou en commerce captur√©s, 15 millions de perte, dont 7 000 esclaves. Iberville's intentions were to attack Virginia next, but his death at Havana on 9 July 1706 ended the campaign.. Brillant returned to France with the rest of the squadron. In 1707, she was reclassified as a Third rate (vaisseau troisi√®me de rang) and refitted.Tableau de la flotte fran√ßaise en 1707, d'apr√®s . She returned to service in 1708, in the midst of a financial crisis that made it difficult to maintain the fleet.. Duguay- Trouin's brother, visiting Brest in 1707, remarked that only four ships were seaworthy. Brillant was among them, but stayed in port..  Raid on Rio de Janeiro (1711)  In 1711, Brillant was reactivated for a raid on Rio de Janeiro, under Duguay-Trouin, with seven ships of the line, six frigates, a bombship and three transports.The other vessels were Lys (74; the flagship), Magnanime (74), Mars (56), l'Achille (66), Glorieux (66), Fid√®le (58), the frigates of 40 to 44 guns l'Aigle, Chancelier, and l'Argonaute, the frigates of 34 to 44 guns Glorieuse, l'Amazone, and l'Astr√©e, the galiot of 36 guns Bellone, and three transports.. She was under Chevalier de Goyon-Beaufort.. She had two extra 6-poundersTableau de la flotte fran√ßaise en 1712, d'apr√®s . and 522 men. The squadron departed in early June, slipped past British cruisers, and arrived at Rio on 12 September. The French attacked immediately, with Brillant second in the line of battle. On 13 September, Goyon-Beaufort was put in charge of the landing at Goat Island.. Along with Mars, she bombarded and destroyed the main fort of the city. Duguay-Trouin then gave Goyon-Beaufort command of one of the landing parties. After the Battle of Rio de Janeiro ended in Portuguese surrender and payment of a tribute, Brillant returned to France during November. She avoided the storm on 19 January 1712 that sank two of the ships of the squadron (Magnanime and Fid√®le), along with their loot, off the Azores.. With the return of peace, Brillant was put in the ordinary. In 1717, she was due for a refit in Brest.Tableau de la flotte fran√ßaise en 1717, d'apr√®s . She was struck in 1719. Legacy Brillant was the inspiration for Herg√©'s Unicorn in the albums The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, a ship of the French navy captained by an ancestor of Captain Haddock.. A model of Brillant is on display at the Mus√©e national de la Marine, in Paris. It was made around 1836 by modelist Jean-Baptiste Tanneron, based on documents contemporary with the ship. The model is at the 1/40th scale, making it 48 cm high, 35 cm wide and 140 cm long. It is unrigged and without artillery, most of the effort having been devoted to the sculptures that reproduce Jean B√©rain's drawings. The poop deck bears the motto Honneur et Patrie, which has been part of the motto of the French Navy since the 19th century, but is anachronistic for the Louis XIV era, where sailors would simply shout out Vive le Roi (\\"Long live the King\\"). The model was put on display for the temporary exhibit Tintin, Haddock et les bateaux in 1999.

It was a heavy modification of its predecessor, the Fortschritt E 170 series. Several E 510 combines were made for testing purposes; however, the tests which were conducted in the 1963 harvesting season showed, that the E 510 was no improvement over the E 170 series. Despite having developed the E 510 to a point where it was ready to go into series production, the E 510's series production never commenced, and the E 510 was cancelled. Instead, Fortschritt developed a completely new combine harvester, the Fortschritt E 512.  Development  The E 170 series combines, which had been in production since 1954, proved to not be well-suited for the growing East-German Agricultural Production Cooperatives, because of their high corn loss, poor ergonomics, and aging design; in addition to that, the E 170 series combines had a small header, a small corn tank, and no continuously variable transmission (CVT). Therefore, Fortschritt sought to replace the aging E 170 series with a new, more efficient model. Development began in 1962. The new model ‚Äì designated the E 510 ‚Äì was basically a heavy modification of the ongoing E 170 series. The E 510 had a header that was approximately 200 mm wider, a bigger corn tank with an improved unloading mechanism, a three-speed gearbox with an additional CVT, and the 44 kW engine from the E 175\\\\. It was considered upgrading the engine even further to 55 kW. After a series of tests conducted in the 1963 harvesting season, where the E 510 had to compete against several combine harvesters from Western countries, it became obvious that it was not a significant improvement over the E 170 series. Therefore, it was decided in February 1964, not to put the E 510 into series production. From 1964 to 1968, a new combine harvester was developed, the Fortschritt E 512. It was later put into series production instead of the E 510\\\\. Only a few pre-production units of the E 510 were made.

The year after, he was again at Newfoundland with Licorne and Amphion, supporting fishing. In 1767, he was again supporting fishing off Newfoundland, this time captaining the 32-gun frigate Inconstante, and in 1768 again with Enjou√©e. In 1768, he commanded the 32-gun frigate Enjou√©e and sailed from Newfoundland to Morocco to test marine chronometers by Pierre Le Roy and John Harrison one against the other, as part of the quest for an accurate measurement of longitude. The tests showed that Le Roy's chronometer did not perform better than Harrison's. In 1770, Tronjoli was tasked with ferrying troops between Martnique and France, with the 64-gun Union and the fluyt Seine. In 1771, he commanded Union for a cruise to the Cape of Good Hope, where he was again the year after. In 1773, Tronjoli was given command of the 64-gun Lion, which he sailed from Brest to Toulon. Tronjoly was promoted to Brigadier in 1776. He was given command of the 64-gun Indien, and later the 64-gun Brillant at Isle de France (Mauritius) and Ile Bourbon. In 1777, he was patrolling the Malabar coast and protecting French interests at Puducherry. The year after, he conducted diplomatic missions to the Aceh Sultanate and took part in the Siege of Pondicherry. He also conducted reconnaissance of the port of Trincomalee, which he reported as a good harbour, but with poor infrastructure and defences, and therefore of little practical interest for naval operations. Tronjoli twice wrote to the Navy Minister to warn of his lack of resources to carry out his missions against the British, and failing to get reinforcements, fell back to commerce raiding. He despatched frigates to the Cape of Good Hope in an attempt to disrupt British commerce there, but the attempt was largely unsuccessful. From 1779, he commanded the India Division, with his flag on the 64-gun Brillant. That year, he was opposed to Captain Saint-Orens, of Pourvoyeuse, regarding the capture of the East Indiaman Osterley. On 22 November 1779, Tronjoli was relieved of duty. He was replaced with Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves. He was later recalled to France and embarked on Osterley to return to Brest, where he arrived in late April 1781.

It is the headquarters of Tower Hamlets London Borough Council. History =Mulberry Place= Following the local government re-organisation of 1965, Tower Hamlets London Borough Council initially based itself at Bethnal Green Town Hall. In the early 1990s the council decided to move to modern accommodation in a more central location in the borough; the site selected formed part of a development by the Nordic Construction Company to regenerate the western part of the East India Import Dock. The new building originally formed part of a larger development of four linked blocks, the other three forming a datacentre campus. The development, which was designed by Sten Samuelson and the Beaton Thomas Partnership in the Modernist style, was built by Birse Construction and was completed in 1992. The design made extensive use of reflective glazing and pink Sardinian granite. The name for the building designated for use by the council, Mulberry Place, was chosen to commemorate the construction of the Mulberry harbours in the dock during the Second World War. The council moved into the building in summer 1993. A mural by the staff and pupils of George Green's School entitled \\"Awakening\\", which depicts the reshaping of the east end by the development of London Docklands, was subsequently installed in the foyer. In October 2018, the owner of the building, LaSalle Investment, which charges the council ¬£5 million per year for the rental of Mulberry Place, announced that it would convert the building into flats after the council leaves in 2022. =Proposals for a Civic Centre= In February 2015 the council acquired the old Royal London Hospital, which had closed two years earlier, for ¬£9 million and announced plans to convert it into a new \\"civic centre\\". The original hospital, which had been designed by Boulton Mainwaring, had opened to staff and patients in September 1757. Planning consent was given for the conversion scheme in March 2018. The conversion works, which are being designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris and undertaken by Bouygues at a cost of ¬£109.5 million, are expected to be complete in 2022. The design involves the retention of the old facade and the construction of three new buildings behind the facade arranged around a new public square.

She is known for her archaeological expeditions to Tres Zapotes and other sites in Southern Mexico in the 1940s, conducted alongside her husband Matthew Stirling, which according to National Geographic \\"essentially rewrote Mesoamerican history\\". Her discovery of a date in the Long Count calendar, corresponding to 32 BCE, on a stela from Tres Zapotes, helped establish the antiquity of the Olmec civilization for the first time. She also served as the president of the Washington Textile Museum and the Society of Woman Geographers twice (1960‚Äì1963 and 1969‚Äì1972).  Early life and education  Marion Illig was born in Middletown, New York on May 12, 1911 and graduated from Rider College in 1930. In 1931 she moved to Washington, D.C. to take a position as secretary to Matthew Stirling, the Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Needing to look up the word \\"ethnology\\" in a dictionary before she started the job, she studied anthropology under Truman Michelson at George Washington University to better understand the field.  Archaeological career  Illig married Stirling on December 11, 1933. For their honeymoon, she accompanied Stirling as he traveled around the Southeastern United States conducting archaeological excavations for the Public Works Administration. During this time she trained in field archaeology alongside a number of young scholars who would go on to become prominent figures, including Gordon Willey, James A. Ford, Jesse D. Jennings, and Marshall T. Newman. In 1938, the Stirlings visited Mexico for the first time. While Marion, pregnant with her first child, visited Mitla and Monte Alb√°n, Matthew traveled eight hours on horseback from Tlacotalpan to Tres Zapotes, to see the Olmec colossal head discovered there by Jos√© Mar√≠a Melgar y Serrano in 1862. He found that the sculpture was surrounded by a substantial archaeological site and, upon returning to the United States, the Stirlings obtained grants from the National Geographic Society and Smithsonian Institution to explore the area further. Between 1939 and 1946, they conducted eight expeditions to Southern Mexico, which according to National Geographic \\"essentially rewrote Mesoamerican history\\". Pugh's role on the excavation was as \\"housekeeper, bookkeeper, and supervisor of artifact preparation in the field laboratory\\". Stirling described her as his \\"co-explorer, co-author and general co- ordinator\\". Pugh was a member of the Association of American Geographers and served as the president of the Society of Woman Geographers twice, in 1960‚Äì1963 and 1969‚Äì1972. She won the National Geographic Society's Franklin L. Burr Award in 1941, along with Matthew Stirling and Richard Hewitt Stewart, and the Society of Women Geographers' Gold Medal in 1975. She had a long association with the Textile Museum at George Washington Museum, serving as a trustee, secretary, treasurer, vice president and president, and establishing a fund for the acquisition of Latin American textiles.  Personal life and legacy  Pugh's first husband Matthew Stirling died in 1975. They had two children, Matthew W. Stirling Jr. (1938‚Äì1989) and Ariana Stirling Withers (1942‚Äì2015). She was married to John Ramsey Pugh, a retired general involved with the Textile Museum, from 1977 until his death in 1994. While in her 80s, she travelled to Antarctica. She died in Tucson, Arizona, on April 24, 2001. The Stirling archives were donated by their grandchildren to the National Anthropological Archives at the Smithsonian Institution in 2006.

After working in the television industry in Mumbai for a decade, she returned to her ancestral home in Rajasthan, and used the skills of the local community to restore an ancestral fort in her village Meja near Bhilwara. Her use of local skills for the restoration and social upliftment efforts towards the local community won her the Nari Shakti Puraskar from the Indian Government. Life She was born about 1983, and educated at Mayo College Girls School and Sophia College in Ajmer. Her father Jitendra Singh is a retired bureaucrat and mother Ramma Kumari is a housewife. She began her career in the media as an Assistant Director with filmmaker Muzaffar Ali in New Delhi and worked on several projects like an Indo-French Opera, an international music festival series Jahan-e-Khusrau, and a Cultural Festival at the Southbank Centre London. These were followed by some freelance creative projects with DDNE, DD Kashir, ICCR, UNODC, etc. Later she worked in the television industry in Mumbai as a Content Developer for shows such as Kaun Banega Crorepati, Dus Ka Dum and India's Got Talent. However, she decided to give it up on a visit home when she decided to restore the family's ancestral home, a 60 room fort which had not been repaired ever since it was built over 146 years ago. Meja Fort was built by her ancestor, Rawat Amar Singh Ji around 1875 after being granted this Jagir in 1871 by the Maharana of Mewar. She moved into the fort, and ensured that the restoration process employed local people, and the women in particular benefitted by earning their own income. She used traditional building techniques like dry stone masonry, lime plaster, etc to restore this structure spread across an area of about 50,000 square feet.The Meja Dam is nearby. The restored fort was used as a location for a short film titled \\"Blouse\\". The film put the restored work on show and the local people earned employment and fame by assisting the filmmaker Vijayeta Kumar and appearing as extras in the film. The film got a theatrical release by PVR Cinemas and received the Best Short Film award at the New York Indian Film Festival in 2014-15. One local boy's singing talent spotted by Singh has seen him establish a move to Mumbai.The fort is used as a base for local celebrations like Gangaur, Jal Jhoolni Ekadashi, etc. and it is also being used for community welfare activities like Blood Donation and Yoga Camps. The fort also houses a Community Library for the locals. Eventually the fort may be used as a residence for visiting tourists. In February 2018, Singh was chosen as one of the 25 inspiring women from across India to receive the Advantage Woman Award given by the ICICI Bank. The award was presented to her in Mumbai by actor Vidya Balan for her restoration work and the project's social impact.

It received mixed reviews in scholarly and popular publications. Some reviewers praised Confino's analysis for its originality, while others criticize it for making assertions that are not sufficiently backed by evidence. Contents Confino rejects some of the explanations for Nazism that were popular, especially the explanations that are heavy on racism. He focuses on the period 1933‚Äì1939 and on public actions and statements. His answer to the question of why the Nazis committed genocide against the Jews is that \\"Jews represented time, symbolizing evil historical origins that had to be eradicated for Nazi civilization to arise.\\" This opens up a new area to analyze, imagination and fantasy as well as ideology. Instead of emphasising racism, he proposes that Nazi antisemitism was transcended racism and was based on much more than scientific racism. Instead, ideas about science and race were twisted to accommodate the extreme antisemitism which derived in part from Christian antisemitism. What was more important than scientific racism was telling a story about national origins. Confino rejects the idea, promoted by some historians and Christian apologists, that the Nazis sought to eradicate Christianity: \\"Their aim was not to eradicate Christianity but to eradicate Christianity‚Äôs Jewish roots,\\" based on an extreme version of supersessionism which would end the conflict between the contradictory truth claims of Judaism and Christianity. Hitler used the anti-Jewish struggle to justify World War II \\"Jews gave the overall meaning to the Nazi fight between good and evil: the messianic struggle to create a Nazi civilization depended on the extermination of the Jews.\\" When the Nazis burned Torah scrolls during Kristallnacht in November 1938, he contends, they severed a key link with the past and made it possible for both Germans and Jews to imagine \\"a world without Jews.\\" Rather than focus on concrete anti-Jewish policies, Confino focuses on exploring the \\"sensibilities and emotions\\" that lay behind him. In so doing, he verges into a psychoanalytic analysis of Nazi leaders, although avoiding \\"blatantly Freudian terminology.\\" Confino tries to steer a middle path between approaches which present Nazi antisemitism as a rupture with the past and those who view it as an extension of previous phenomena. He writes that \\"The Holocaust was the first experiment in a new humanity achieved by extermination, a humanity liberated from the shackles of its own past.\\" But according to Confino, the Nazis' actions were rooted in centuries of Christian tradition. Controversially, he argues that the rupture carries over into Holocaust memory, where \\"extermination as a sort of genesis\\" was continued: \\"The Holocaust has haunted the postwar imagination because the European-wide extermination provided for Jews, Germans, and Europeans a story of origins and new beginning\\" (p. 245). Reception David Cesarani praised the book, although he found it to gloss over some detail of anti-Jewish persecution which would have complicated Confino's argument. He praised Confino's \\"thought-provoking\\" analysis of speeches by Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbels from 1941‚Äì1945. Cesarani writes that Confino's book will appeal to those who believe that the Holocaust was unique. In a positive review, Ferenc Lacz√≥ describes the book as \\"a path-breaking cultural historical analysis of Nazi sensibilities, fantasies, and agendas\\" and praises its \\"innovative and insightful interpretation.\\" However, he has \\"minor reservations\\" about the book's tendency to generalize and overlook heterogeneity in German society and states that the book lacks a \\"thorough grounding in social history\\". Richard Steigmann-Gall writes that the book is an outgrowth of Confino's earlier book, Foundational Pasts, which defended a culturalist understanding of the Nazi era and the Holocaust. He writes that \\"There is much to commend in Confino‚Äôs book\\" but that it suffers from lack of attention to detail in some areas, due to being composed as an extended essay rather than a monograph. Susannah Heschel is more critical of the book, arguing that Confino does not justify his conclusions with sufficient evidence, often makes unhelpful generalizations, and fails to place developments in their historical context. She wrote that Confino often fails to credit others who did more in-depth research than he did, and came to the same conclusions first. She argues that Confino never answers the question raised in the subtitle, of how Nazism went \\"from persecution to genocide\\". According to Jeffrey Herf Confino's book \\"displays repeated gaps between assertion and evidence.\\" His method \\"impute[s] motivations and emotions to actors based on what they did, how they looked when they did it, and what they kept silent about\\"‚Äîwhich Herf argues is \\"dubious.\\" Herf argues that Confino needs to do more research in archives to find evidence that would corroborate his conclusions.

In traditional Norwegian history, the Black Death is given a major importance, as an explanation for the deterioration of Norway from an independent nation in the early 14th-century, to its loss of political independence in the Kalmar Union in the late century, which caused Norway to lose political and economic independence and become a Danish province for centuries onward. While the exact number deaths from the Black Death is unknown, it is clear that the plague caused a demographic shock, and that the population did not recover to pre-pandemic levels until the 17th-century. Background =Norway in the mid-14th century= At this point in time, Norway was in a personal union with Sweden under the same monarch, Magnus IV of Sweden. =The Black Death= Since the outbreak of the Black Death at the Crimea, it had reached Sicily by an Italian ship from the Crimea. After having spread across the Italian states, and from Italy to France, Spain and England, the plague reached Norway by a plague ship from England in the summer of 1349. Plague migration =Western Norway= The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached Bergen in Norway by ship from England in late summer (probably August) of 1349, and spread from Bergen North to Trondheim in the autumn of 1349. The Black Death in Norway is famously described in the unique contemporary Icelandic sources Gotskalks annal and L√∂gmanns-ann√°l by Einar Haflidason, which describes the migration of the Black Death in detail in Western Norway. The L√∂gmanns-ann√°l contains the witness statements of the Icelandic Bishops Orm of H√≥lar and Gyrd Ivarsson of Skalholt, who visited Norway when the plague arrived from England and returned to Iceland when it had left Norway again in 1351. In this testimony, it is described how the infamous \\"Plague ship\\" arrived to Bergen in Norway from England. When the cargo was unloaded from the ship, the ship crew started to die. Shortly after, the inhabitants of Bergen started to die, and from Bergen it continued all over Norway, ultimately killing a third of the population. The ship from England reportedly was lowered, but several plague ships were to have stranded along the beaches in the same fashion. The Gotskalks annal also gives a detailed account of the same event. It also names a number of the victims of the plague, among whom were several members of the clergy, an account that can be verified by other sources. It also states that the plague migrated from Bergen north to Nidaros in 1349. Additional information is found from wills, contracts, and other documents from the period of the plague. Because of this, the plague in Western Norway is better documented than in Sweden, Denmark and Finland (the plague did not reach Iceland until 1402). =Eastern Norway= In contrast to the famous and documented plague migration in Western Norway, the migration of the plague in Eastern Norway is only indirectly documented, as there are no direct references to it or testimonies similar to the one in Western Norway. Because of the great focus on Western Norway, it was long believed that the plague migrated only from Bergen to the rest of the country. By the data from the plague deaths in Oslo, it appears that Oslo was in fact reached by the plague before Bergen: already in May or June 1349, with the difference that there are no witness accounts from its progress in contrast to Western Norway. The plague is likely to have reached Oslo by sea in the spring or early summer of 1349, presumably by ship. From Oslo, it migrated North toward Hamar, West toward Valdres in Central Norway, South West toward Stavanger, and to the East toward Sweden. The Black Death appear not to have reached Stavanger in the South from Bergen, because the first plague deaths are not noted there until 1350, and it likely migrated to it from Oslo. =Northern Norway= It is unknown whether the Black Death reached Northern Norway. However, the fact that the church in Trondenes was built in the late 14th century or early 15th century, when the rest of Norway rather abandoned churches because of the population loss than built new ones, indicate that the plague did not reach this part of the nation. Consequences In traditional history, the Black Death has played a major role as the explanation to why Norway lost its position as a major Kingdom in the early 14th century, and entered a many centuries-long period of stagnation as the most neglected of the Kingdoms of the Kalmar Union under Denmark in the late 14th century. Norway entered the Kalmar Union in 1380, initially as an equal Kingdom under a personal union but from 1536 as a Danish province: it was transferred to a personal union under Sweden in 1814, and was not to regain its status as an independent nation until 1905. This period was a traumatic period of stagnation, exploitation and lack of development under foreign power, and a major contributing factor to this has been attributed to the Black Death, and the population loss caused by it. That Norway did experience a demographic shock is clearly documented. Of the 36.500 farms and 60.000 households that existed around the year 1300, 16.000 farms and 23.000 households existed in 1520, and the population in 15th-century Norway is estimated to have been less than half of what it had been in 1300. Between 60 and 65 percent of the population are estimated to have died during the Black Death, and Norway was not to recover until the 17th-century. However, this is not enough to attribute the political decline of Norway: England also lost about 60 or 65 percent of its population to the Black Death, and Sweden also did not recover until the 17th-century. What may however support the traditional explanation that the Black Death caused the political decline of Norway was the fact that the death toll among the social elite classes appears to have been much higher in Norway than in both Sweden and England, contributing to a smaller class which could protect Norway's role and independence toward the dominance of foreign elites during the Kalmar Union. It appears that the death toll was big in all the elite classes in Norwegian society, contributing to the Norwegian loss of independence under the Kalmar Union in several areas. This is clear when the comparison is made to Sweden, which also became a part of the Kalmar Union under Denmark, but who unlike Norway managed to protect their rights much better toward Denmark because of the strong Swedish nobility. While all Bishops survived the Black Death in Sweden, all Bishops in Norway died in the plague with the exception of the Bishop of Oslo: in 1371, it was noted that of the 300 priests in Norway prior to the plague, only 40 was left. The Norwegian class of officials appear to have experienced heavy losses, as the King was forced to concentrate those left to the Southern provinces to restore order while leaving the Northern provinces to themselves, and in 1351‚Äì52, a report stated that the tax to the Pope was impossible to collect in Norway because the administration had broken down and a great lack organization existed there because of the plague. The diminished Norwegian nobility was not able to protect the political rights of Norway in the Kalmar Union and the military power was lost to Denmark who used mercenaries from Germany; the Norwegian merchant class lost their power of the Norwegian economy to the German merchants of the Hanseatic League who established themselves in Bergen; and the dead Norwegian officials were replaced by German and Danish officials appointed to administer Norway for Denmark; all of which has been described as the decline of Norway under the Danish dominance of the Kalmar Union.

Early life and education Sederberg was born on May 17, 1930 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Charles Sederberg, a farmer, and Agnes Engquist Sederberg.Minnesota Birth record #1930-36496, May 17, 1930. He attended South High School in Minneapolis, MinnesotaSouth High School (Minneap0lis, MN) Yearbook (1948) before moving to California.

Career After his stint in the Army, Sederberg went to work as a reporter with the Los Angeles Times, gaining particular experience writing about the West Coast business scene. He was tapped by the Times to serve as a financial writer on the newspaper's tabloid spinoff, the Mirror-News, until the closure of that publication.See, e.g., \\"Bush Elected Head of Financial Writers Group,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 23, 1957; \\"S.C. Financial Writers Elect,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 1, 1959. Rejoining the Times in 1962, the following year Sederberg was sent by the Times to New York to serve as the Los Angeles Times' first East Coast financial correspondent and head of the newspaper's Wall Street bureau.\\"Times Opening Wall Street Bureau, Broadens Financial News Coverage,\\" Los Angeles Times, 1963. Sederberg's columns on West Coast business and the national economy were published across the country throughout the 1960s. In 1970, Sederberg left the Times to join the well-known Los Angeles public relations firm of Carl Byoir & Associates, where his principal client became the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes. Along with his senior colleague at Byoir, Dick Hannah, Sederberg helped to arrange Hughes' bizarre public phone interview on January 9, 1972, in which Hughes, from an undisclosed location in the Bahamas, took questions over a speakerphone from familiar reporters in order to prove that Clifford Irving's alleged authorized biography of Hughes was a fraud.Gladwin Hill, \\"Howard Hughes Tells of His Life in a 3,000-Mile Phone Interview,\\" New York Times, January 10, 1972. Sederberg was later the face of the Hughes organization, known as Summa Corp., at the time of Hughes' death, and during the unraveling of his estate, addressing the media on behalf of the organization on the search for a legitimate will left by Hughes and the confusion that followed over the sudden appearance of the handwritten \\"Mormon Will\\" that gave $156 million of his $1.56 billion estate to gas station owner Melvin Dummar;Linda Deutsch, \\"Confusion Shrouds Hughes' Estate,\\" Santa Ana Register, April 4, 1977. the operations of Summa Corp. without its deceased chairman and stockholder;See, \\"Howard Hughes' influence still felt,\\" The Newark (OH) Advocate, November 8, 1976; \\"Hughes Firm Seeking to Sell Mine Operations,\\" Hobbs (NM) Daily News-Sun, January 9, 1977. the disposition of Hughes' Spruce Goose seaplane;Bruce Winters, \\"Hughes's big Goose may go to a museum,\\" The Baltimore Sun, May 12, 1977. and the indictment of one of Hughes' long-time aides for conspiring to provide Hughes with illegal drugs.\\"Hughes aide indicted in plot to get codeine,\\" The (Bryan, Texas) Eagle, March 19, 1978.

Sederberg documented his time with the Hughes organization in a memoir, Hughesworld: The Strange Life and Death of an American Legend (2013). After leaving Byoir, Sederberg wrote financial columns for the Hearst Syndicate and appeared as a daily commentator and managing editor on the Financial News Network, an early cable television business network, before it was acquired by CNBC in 1991. As a financial reporter, he was showed extraordinary prescience in anticipating trends: in a column for the Los Angeles Times in 1967, he pondered a \\"checkless, even moneyless society, made possible by the advent of the computer\\";\\"Is It Possible to Fall in Love With a $20-Billion Giant?,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 2, 1967. and in a 1979 interview with Dennis Stanfill, president and chief executive of 20th Century Fox Corp., Sederberg suggested that the Los Angeles Dodgers might be a logical acquisition target for Fox, presaging a wave of team acquisitions by media conglomerates. Stanfill said no;\\"Show Biz,\\" Pottsville Republican & Herald, September 5, 1979. but under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch, Fox acquired the Dodgers in 1998.\\"Dodgers Owners\\". MLB.com. Los Angeles Dodgers. Retrieved 2020-05-08. As writer In addition to his Hughes' memoir, Sederberg wrote over a dozen novels, including The Kingmakers (1984), about a fictional Los Angeles newspaper family, and Zora (1989), a revenge story concerning the Armenian genocide. His best known novel is The Power Players (1979), about which the Los Angeles Times observed, \\"Sederberg has much to reveal about the clandestine workings of multinational conglomerates, and the men who run them.\\"Grover Sales, \\"Novelizing the power play of conglomerates,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 30, 1979. The Washington Post was also appreciative of the novel, saying that \\"Sederberg understands people and how to write about them,\\"\\"Profit Motif,\\" Washington Post, January 26, 1980. and The New York Times called the book \\"more fun and certainly more plausible than [Sidney] Sheldon's recent and impenetrable 'Bloodline.'\\"Peter Andrews, \\"The Sweet Smell of Success,\\" The New York Times Book Review, February 17, 1980.

Based in Walnut Creek, California, the team competes in exhibition games outside the G League's traditional team structure and is a part of the league's one-year development program for elite NBA prospects. Its roster will be made up of both prospects and veteran players. The Ignite were created in April 16, 2020 and is touted as an alternative to college basketball, offering prospects salaries of up to $500,000. History The NBA G League has been an avenue for high school, college and international prospects to be drafted into the NBA since 2008. On October 18, 2018, the G League introduced Select Contracts of $125,000 for elite prospects, including opportunities for basketball development, life skills mentorship and academic scholarship, starting from the 2019‚Äì20 season. However, no players in the 2019 high school class signed a Select Contract. On April 16, 2020, the G League announced a raised salary for elite prospects and a one-year development program outside of its traditional team structure. The prospects will play alongside veteran players on a select team that will take part in training and 10 to 12 exhibition games against other G League teams, foreign national teams and NBA academies. Players will earn financial incentives for playing games, participating in community events and attending life skills programs coordinated by the G League. They will also receive a full scholarship to Arizona State University, which has partnered with the NBA. On the same day that the G League's new development program was announced, Jalen Green, the highest ranked player in the 2020 high school class according to ESPN, became the first player to join the NBA G League Ignite, earning $500,000. The G League subsequently drew attention as an alternative to college basketball, with some media outlets speculating that Green's decision would threaten the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Green was soon joined on the team by fellow five-star recruits Isaiah Todd and Daishen Nix, both former college commits, as well as Kai Sotto of the Philippines. On June 9, 2020, former NBA player and coach Brian Shaw was named head coach of the Ignite. On July 16, Jonathan Kuminga, the highest ranked player in the 2021 high school class, reclassified to the 2020 class and signed with the Ignite.

The Black Death in Sweden is only mentioned directly in few contemporary documents; in a letter from the king, in a sermon by Saint Bridget of Sweden, in a letter from the city council in Visby to their colleagues in L√ºbeck, and in a letter from the Pope, replying to a letter from the Swedish king. There is, however, indirect contemporary information, as well as later descriptions of it. Background =Sweden in the mid-14th century= At this point in time, Sweden was in a personal union with Norway under the same monarch, Magnus IV of Sweden. In 1348, the king had conducted a crusade against the Orthodox Russians in the border of Finland, and conducted another in 1350, the year of the plague. Sweden was a nation progressing in many ways: the first national law constitutions, the Magnus Erikssons landslag and the Stadslagen, was introduced during this period. =The Black Death= Since the outbreak of the Black Death at the Crimea, it had reached Sicily by an Italian ship from the Crimea. After having spread across the Italian states, and from Italy to France from France to England, the plague reached Norway by a plague ship from England in the summer of 1349. In the summer of 1350, Sweden was surrounded by plague in Norway to the West and Denmark to the South. Plague migration Saint Bridget of Sweden Magnus IV of Sweden. The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached Western Sweden from Norway in the late summer or autumn of 1350, and appears to have reached Central Sweden from Gotland during the spring and summer of the same year.Janken Myrdal: Digerd√∂den, pestv√•gor och √∂del√§ggelse. Ett perspektiv p√• senmedeltidens Sverige The progress of the Black Death in Sweden is not directly described in contemporary sources, but it can be traced by indirect documentation such as wills and donations to the church, and by tracing the residence of the king, who continually moved from away from the plague to places where it had not yet arrived, or from where it had already passed. In 1349, king Magnus of Sweden and Norway issued a warning about the plague to his Swedish subjects. While the letter is not dated, it was likely written in L√∂d√∂se in September 1349, judging from the known place of residence and other letters issued by the king which has been dated. In the letter, it is clear that the plague had not reached Sweden and that the king issued a royal proclamation of public penance, in an attempt to soften the wrath of God to prevent the Black Death in Norway from reaching Sweden: :\\"We proclaim to You, that we have been given tidings that are truly frightening, and of which every Christian should justly fear; that God has because of the Sins of Man cast a great misery upon the entire world, that of hasty evil death, so that most of the people who lived in the lands West of our land are now dead of that misery and it is now present in all of Norway and Halland and are progressing toward us, so that everywhere in those lands it is so strong that people [with no prior illness] falls down and dies, when a moment ago they were healthy [...]; and where ever it progresses not enough people are left who can bury those that die. Now We fear, because of the great love and care we have for you that, because of the Sins of Man, the same misery and death should come over our own subjects.\\" In order to prevent the plague from reaching Sweden, the king issued several commands. In Europe, the plague was commonly believed to be a punishment from God for the Sins of humanity. Therefore, the commands of the king was of religious nature and designed to lessen the wrath of God. In the public royal letter, which was circulated to the Bishops of the Kingdom, all Swedes regardless of class, age or gender were commanded to regularly attend mass, give alms to the poor, confess and do penance, fast on water and bread every Friday and give what they could to the Virgin Mary, the church and the king. The Black Death first appeared in Sweden in the big port city of Visby on Gotland, likely by ship from Denmark or Germany, where it was present in May or at the latest July 1350. In July 1350, nine people was burned in Visby after having confessed under torture that they had caused the plague by poisoning. Two of them were priests who confessed that they had poisoned the mass cloth (which the parishioners kissed during mass) with plague during Whit Monday mass in May, and the other seven were men employed by the church who confessed to having poisoned wells and lakes in Stockholm, V√§ster√•s and Arboga and across the Swedish countryside. This case was described in a letter from July 1350 to the city council of Rostock in Germany received a letter from the city council of Visby in Sweden. In June 1350, the king was in Bergen in Norway, where the plague had died out by that time: he continued to Stockholm in August, but immediately left for √Öland when the plague reached Stockholm the same month, and continued from √Öland to Reval, where he stayed from December 1350 to May 1351, when he finally returned to Stockholm after the Black Death had begun to subside in Sweden. The Black Death appears to have first reached Gotland by sea in the spring or early summer of 1350, and spread across Eastern and Central Sweden during the summer and autumn: from Sm√•land and √ñsterg√∂tland to N√§rke and Uppland between August and December 1350, with a presence in Stockholm and Uppsala in August. The progress of the plague in Western and Northern Sweden is not as clearly visible. I September 1350, the plague was present in eastern Norway along the Western border of Sweden, in Norwegian J√§mtland North of Sweden, and in Danish Sk√•ne south of the Swedish border, making it likely to have reached Western Sweden from Norway slightly later, in the autumn of 1350. Northern Sweden is completely unknown it this respect, but it is noted that the colonization of the Torne Valley stopped suddenly in the 14th century and did not resume for two centuries. Saint Bridget of Sweden commented the Black Death in Sweden: : \\"For three Sins did the misery come to the realm, that is for pride, intemperance and greed. Therefore God can be placated by three things, so that the torment may be shortened.\\" She stated that the Black Death had reached Sweden because of the Sins of pride, intemperance and greed, particularly because of the sinful dress fashion of the women, and that the wrath of God could be placated if the Swedes abstained from sinfully provocative fashion; if the parish priests lead their congregations in penance; and if the bishops organized public penitence masses in the cathedrals and washed the feet of the poor. Sometime in the summer or autumn in 1350, king Magnus sent a letter to Pope Clemens VI in Avignon. In March 1351, the pope sent a letter to Sweden in Norway as a reply to this letter, in which he ordered the Bishops of Lund, Uppsala and Trondheim to encourage their parishioners to join the king in his crusade against the Orthodox Russians, because so many of his soldiers and subjects had died during the plague that he was forced to interrupt his crusade. =Finland= Finland was at this point a part of Sweden and it has sometimes been assumed that the plague was present there in 1351‚Äì1352. It is unconfirmed whether the Black Death ever reached Finland, as there are no direct references to its presence there. In 1352, the priests of Turku parish were forbidden to leave their parishes, which may be interpreted as a way to ban them from abandoning their parishioners during the plague, but the reason for this prohibition is not stated. It is noted that Finland also had its \\"plague legends\\" about the Black Death, which are similar to those in Sweden. It has been suggested that the plague never reached Finland because the contacts between Sweden and Finland was disconnected during the Black Death Ole J√∏rgen Benedictow: The Black Death, 1346-1353: The Complete History or that it did reach Finland but had less impact, because the low population made it difficult for it to spread. The Black Death did reach neighboring Russia, were it is known to have been present in 1352-1353 before tempering out; but it likely reached Russia by way of the Baltics, where the Black Death was present in 1351‚Äì1352 and to were it had migrated from Germany. Victims = Death toll = No individual is positively identified as a victim of the Black Death in Sweden in 1350‚Äì1351. It is commonly assumed that the king's two stepbrothers, the sons of his mother Ingeborg of Norway and stepfather duke Canute Porse the Elder, fell victims to the Black Death, as were many individuals who were noted to have died in 1350 or 1351, but in no case are there any contemporary documents which can verify it. While the deaths from the Black Death in Sweden is unknown, it was mentioned as a cause to why Sweden had such a low population for centuries, and it is clear that the plague caused a demographic shock, and that the population did not recover until the 17th century. = Social distribution= Prior to the 15th century, very few people in Sweden below the social elite are documented in any large degree. Only the nobility and the priesthood class are sufficiently recorded to make estimations somewhat possible. It is noted that a disproportional number of the nobility died during the 1350-1351 plague years, particularly among the lower nobility, but less so among the higher levels: twelve of the fifteen members of the Royal Council survived, and of the remaining three who did die during the plague years, two were elderly and may have died of natural causes. The priesthood was the most well documented class from this period in Sweden, and it appears half of the parish priests in V√§ster√•s and Str√§ngn√§s may have died judging from the fact that about half of them were replaced in the years after the Black Death, but only a quarter of the canons; it is also a fact, that all of the Bishops in Sweden-Finland survived the Black Death. This appears to show that the elite survived better than the lower social levels, as the lower clergy and lower nobility were more severely affected than the higher levels of the same classes. The fact that the Swedish elite appear to have survived the Black Death is a contrast to neighboring Norway, where more of the elite classes appear to have died of the Black Death, which made Norway more vulnerable and destabilized following the Black Death and may have contributed to the different positions of Norway and Sweden during the Kalmar Union later that century, during which Sweden managed to keep more of its political independence than Norway. Consequences Folkungabrunnen 2007, Black Death memorial =Economic, social and political effects= The population loss caused a crisis during which the nobility unsuccessfully attempted to introduce serfdom in the 15th century. This was similar to Denmark, with the exception that in neighboring Denmark the nobility did succeed in introducing serfdom (Vornedskab). The Swedish nobiility was however nt to be so successful. The great loss of lives contributed to higher demands from the surviving workers upon the elite, who responded with refusals and attempts at greater repression, which resulted in great social tensions. This was common for many countries after the Black Death. These events are not as documented in Sweden as elsewhere. A donation of a property from Lady Margareta, the widow of Avid of Risn√§s, and her son Stefan to the Link√∂ping Cathedral in 13 June 1353, is a rare example of this, as the document clearly states that they had to sell the property for a much lower price than its actual worth: :\\"...because of the great mortality recently, and the devastation of so many properties, which could hardly be sold for half of its worth because of the rarity of people who can work them.\\" The higher demands of the workers and peasants and the lower incomes of the nobility caused social tensions that resulted in several local charters such as the Skara Charter of 1414 and the V√§xj√∂ Charter of 1414, which attempted to introduce serfdom by forcing the tenant farmers to stay on the noble estates with heavy regulations, restricting their rights to move and raising their obligation to work on the noble estates and their taxes to the landlords; in Sweden, however, the power of the nobility and the feudal system was too weak for any serfdom to be successfully introduced, and these laws do not appear to have been effective. During the 15th century, however, several peasant rebellions took place in Sweden and the century is described as one of crisis and social tensions. In the Engelbrektskr√∂nikan ('Engelbrekt Chronicle') from the 1430s, there were complaints about the heavy taxes imposed by Eric of Pomerania with reference to the Black Death, as the king was criticized from demanding a tax which the country could no longer afford, as the population had decreased by the 'Great Death' since then, which devastated the land so that \\"where former one hundred farmers were, there are now but twenty\\". =Religious and cultural consequences= The Black Death was long remembered in Sweden as a catastrophe and referred to why Sweden had such a small population. For centuries, ruins in the forests were often explained as remains from towns and villages devastated by the \\"Great Death\\". Vadstena Abbey was not yet founded in 1350, but the Bridgettine monk Anders Lydekesson (d. 1410) nevertheless included a description of it in his chronicle from 1403‚Äì1408, in which he mentioned for the year of 1350: :\\"At that time a great mortality ravaged the Kingdom of Sweden; no one can recall that there has ever been such an epidemic before nor after.\\" Bishop Peder M√•nsson of V√§ster√•s noted that many farms belonging to the Bishopric were still deserted because of the Black Death, and Olaus Petri attributed the small population of Sweden to the Black Death and referred to it as the cause to why there were wilderness and forests where there had previously been villages and farms. There are several local legends of the devastating effects of the plague. A common theme of them was, that in one parish, only one man survived, and in the neighboring parish, only one woman survived; that they found each other after having sounded the church bells, and that they married and became the ancestors of a new village. Recurrences The Black Death would return regularly, but with fewer death victims, until the 18th century. Sweden was reached also by the second and third European Black Death epidemic of 1359‚Äì1360 and 1368‚Äì1370. The second wave of Black Death in Sweden in 1359 is known to have caused the death of the Crown Prince, his consort Beatrice of Bavaria, and their children.Beatrix, urn:sbl:19091, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av S. Tunberg), h√§mtad 2020-07-07. The plague also returned in repeated national epidemics in 1413, 1421‚Äì22, 1439‚Äì40, 1451, 1455, 1464‚Äì65, 1472‚Äì74 and 1495. Of these, the plague of 1413, 1420‚Äì22 and 1464-66 are described as particularly severe. After the Middle Ages, the plague returned in 1548‚Äì49, 1565‚Äì66, 1572, 1576, 1580, 1603, 1623, 1629‚Äì30, 1638, 1653 and 1657, before the Great Northern War plague outbreak in 1710‚Äì1713, which was to be the last outbreak of Bubonic plague in Sweden.

The organisation‚Äôs Leadership Development Program recruits \\"university-educated high achievers\\" to the classroom as teachers, placing them in eligible partner schools serving low socioeconomic communities for two years. Program participants earn a Masters-level degree in teaching during the two-year program, allowing them to continue to work in school settings following the completion of their placement. The organisation is substantially funded by the Australian Federal Government, with the Leadership Development Program delivered as part of the High Achieving Teachers Program through the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training. Philanthropic and corporate partners and private donors provide additional funding and program support. In 2016 Teach For Australia was ranked 36th among GradAustralia‚Äôs Top 100 Graduate Employers List, while in 2019 it sits at 42nd position, and is the only not-for-profit on the list. In addition, the organisation was the only education-related employer on the Australian Association of Graduate Employer‚Äôs (AAGE) Top 75 Graduate Employers List for 2019, sitting at number 41, a rise from 46 in 2018. Teach For Australia is part of the Teach For All network which operates in 56 countries globally.  History  Teach For Australia was founded in 2009 by Melodie Potts Rosevear, and partnered with the University of Melbourne allowing the first cohort of program participants, known as associates, to begin their Postgraduate Diploma in Teaching through the university in 2010. In 2009 the Gillard Federal Government announced its support for Teach For Australia through a multi-cohort agreement. The first cohort of 45 associates was placed in schools in Victoria following the completion of six weeks of training. 2010 research underpinning the thinking behind the organisation‚Äôs founding produced by ANU economic professor Andrew Leigh found that students taught by high performing teachers (those in the top decile of all teachers) learn as much in six months as what teachers in the bottom decile accomplish in a full year. In 2011 Teach For Australia expanded into the Australian Capital Territory. The organisation‚Äôs recruitment focus was on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) specialists, following an Australian Academy of Science report that revealed that only half of Year 12 students in Australian schools were studying science, compared to nine out of 10 in the early 1990s. To this end, teach For Australia placed 18 STEM specialists as part of the 2011 Cohort who may otherwise have gone into the private sector. Following the 2012 release of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation‚Äôs Report ‚ÄòAsking Students about Teaching Student Perception Surveys and Their Implementation‚Äô Teach For Australia implements student perception surveys to provide student-led data to associates participating in the Leadership Development Program. Teach For Australia expanded into the Northern Territory in 2012 and Western Australia in 2015. In 2013 the Australian Government announced a further multi-cohort funding agreement. In the same year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development‚Äôs (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results find that students from low income households are almost three years behind in school than those from high income households. Also in 2013 cohort 2011 alumni Justin Matthys and Richard Wilson form Maths Pathway ‚Äì designing maths programs that have since been delivered across 170 schools. In 2018 Maths Pathway received a $2.1 million seed investment to improve classroom outcomes. The Australian Government‚Äôs Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations released an independent evaluation of the Teach For Australia program in 2014 that was conducted by the Australian Council for Educational Research. The evaluation finds ‚ÄúTFA attracts exceptional teachers‚Ä¶ and has a big impact on student performance, teacher quality and teacher retention.‚Äù From 2015 until 2019 Teach For All associates earned a Master of Teaching degree through a partnership with Deakin University. In 2019 the organisation partnered with Australian Catholic University, allowing associates to earn a Master of Teaching (Secondary ‚Äì Professional Practice) as part of the program. In 2015 Teach For Australia alumnus Michael Briggs-Miller becomes the first program participant to become a principal when he takes on the principalship of Warracknabeal Secondary College in Victoria‚Äôs Wimmera district. Briggs-Miller cites leadership as a key outcome of the Teach For Australia Leadership Development Program. To further enhance and entrench school leadership as a focal point of its work Teach For Australia partnered with the Sydney Myer Fund and Gandel Philanthropy to create a new program called Teach To Lead, which was aimed at taking school leaders from positions of responsibility to more senior roles within schools. Also in 2015, the Mitchell Institute published an index of opportunity that tracked educational disadvantage and showed that students from low socioeconomic households are significantly more likely to be behind their advantaged peers.Lamb, S, Jackson, J, Walstab, A & Huo, S (2015), Educational opportunity in Australia 2015: Who succeeds and who misses out, Centre for International Research on Education Systems, Victoria University, for the Mitchell Institute, Melbourne: Mitchell Institute. At the same time, teacher unions stepped up their opposition to the program, citing its cost as a factor. In Western Australia the secretary of the State School Teachers Union, Pat Byrne, said that despite some good points, the model was flawed. 2016 saw the Federal Government re- affirm its commitment to Teach For Australia through another multi-cohort agreement. Despite the Government‚Äôs recommitment, opposition to the program grew following the screening of a three-part documentary on Australian free- to-air network SBS entitled Testing Teachers in 2017. In a May 2017 opinion piece Keith Heggart, a PhD student, former teacher and school leader and an organiser for the Independent Education Union, wrote that the program was expensive, consumed school resources and operated at too small a scale to be truly effective. Heggart went on to suggest whole-career support for existing teachers would assist teacher retention and help to attract high quality candidates into teaching. At the same time, the Australian Government released another independent evaluation of the Teach For Australia program conducted by Dandolo, finding that ‚ÄúTeach For Australia is substantially delivering against the Australia Government‚Äôs key objective of placing high quality teachers in schools serving low socioeconomic communities to meet specific skill requirements, for as long as possible.‚Äù Meanwhile, Teach For Australia placed its first program participants into Tasmania, placing 13 associates at nine partner schools. In 2018, Teach For Australia commenced delivery of a Mentor Development program. For the first time the organisation placed more than half of the year‚Äôs cohort of associates into remote and regional schools. In a 2019 pre-election campaign, the Morrison LNP Government promised an increase of $15 million in funding to Teach For Australia (over and above pre-existing commitments) to enhance school leadership capabilities in regional and remote schools. This resulted in the development of a Future Leaders Program in 2020. In 2020, Teach For Australia founder and chief executive officer Melodie Potts Rosevear was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women for her work in \\"driving change and innovation in the Australian education system to tackle educational disadvantage\\". By 2020, Teach For Australia had received more than 12,000 applications for its Leadership Development Program, placing 968 Leadership Development Program associates into 256 schools and producing its 90th Teach To Lead program fellow.  Partner organisations  Teach For Australia is part of the global Teach For All network operating in 56 countries. Across the network, associates, fellows and alumni work together with their communities and colleagues to become leaders for change in classrooms, schools, neighbourhoods, education systems and countries.

Considered to be a milestone in Gujarati literature, it holds an important place among the comic plays in the history of Gujarati drama. The play tells a story of Jivaram Bhatt, who suffers from nyctalopia (night blindness) but does not want people to know about it. When he visits his father-in-law's house, he causes considerable difficulty and confusion while trying in vain to hide his disability. Background Mithyabhiman book cover Dalpatram wrote Mithyabhiman in 1870, with subtitle Bhungal Vinani Bhavai. The play fuses the elements of a comic folk-play form known as Bhavai, traditional Sanskrit drama and western drama. It has eight acts and 14 scenes. It was first published in 1871 by the Gujarat Vernacular Society (then Gujarat Vidhya Sabha) under the title Mithyabhiman athva Jivram Bhatt. Characters The play's main characters are: * Jivram Bhatt, a nyctalopia sufferer * Raghunath, Jivram's father-in-law * Sutradhar * Ranglo (jester) Plot The play is introduced by a dialogue between S≈´tradhƒÅr (who introduces the plot to the audience) and the jester Ranglo. Jivram Bhatt, the protagonist, enters walking through a forest on his way to his father-in-law's house in Manaspuri. However, because he suffers from nyctalopia (night blindness), he cannot decide which way to go. He conceals his disability by pretending to see everything, and rejects the helping hand offered by two shepherds related to his father-in-law's family. Ultimately, he tries to reach his destination by holding the tail of his father-in-law's baby buffalo, who drags him into a ditch beside the road. The second Act opens in the house of Jivram's father- in-law, Raghunath, who, as an orthodox brahmin, believes that the Vedas have mysterious meaning which God alone knows. Ranglo informs him that his son in- law has arrived on the outskirts of Manaspuri. The shepherd Bijal also informs him that Jivram is approaching the village, led by the buffalo's tail. When they do not find Jivram with the buffalo, Raghunath and his son set out in search of him. They find him lying in a ditch. They ask him to accompany them home, but he, being unable to see at night, refuses to go with them, on the pretext that his mother-in-law called him ‚Äònight-blind' on a previous occasion. After a lot of persuasion, Jivram agrees to accompany them on the condition that nobody in the village call him night-blind. Raghunath asks the local prince to issue an order asking all the residents of the village not to call Jivram night-blind. The prince issues such an order. The members of Raghunath's family ask Jivram questions about his achievements. Jivram boasts of his greatness in matters of knowledge, creativity and worship, amongst others. As a result of night-blindness, he bungles every step. When he has a bath, instead of clean water, he pours a pot of animals' urine onto his body. While sitting for dinner, he faces the wall; when his mother-in-law serves him lapshi (a sweet dish made of wheat flour), the young buffalo eats it. Then, when the lady comes to serve the dessert again, Jivram gives her severe beating, thinking she is the buffalo. Devbai cries and curses him. On all these occasions, Jivram tries to justify his behavior stupidly and shamelessly, exhibiting vanity and hypocrisy. Jivram gets up at midnight to use the bathroom; however, to avoid getting lost due to his night-blindness, he ties his turban to the cot and goes to the urinal with the other end of the turban in his hand. However, the baby buffalo chews away the middle portion of the turban. Jivram gets lost and tumbles onto his mother-in-law, who gets up screaming 'thief, thief.' Raghunath and Somnath get up and, taking Jivaram for a thief, start beating him severely. The police arrive and arrest Jivram in the dark. Nobody listens to Jivram's voice in the din. While in police custody, Jivram is beaten to force him to confess the crime. Raghunath and others believe that Jivram has been kidnapped. Raghunath's statement that they won't be able to replace the stolen 'thing' even by paying Rs. 2,000 adds to the confusion. The so-called thief is then brought to the court in a cot and the truth is revealed. Jivram is on the brink of death; in the final Act, he is brought home and treated by a physician-cum-astrologer. But there is no chance of recovery. At the end Jivram repents his unseemly behavior. He asks his relatives to erect a marble pillar in his memory and inscribe it with 12 stanzas which exhort people to abstain from the vices of pride, vanity and hypocrisy. Performance upright=0.7 Mithyabhiman was probably first performed in 1955 by the Natmandal, a theatre school operated by Gujarat Vidhya Sabha. It was directed by Jaishankar Bhojak, and Pransukh Nayak played the role of Jivram Bhatt. In 1998, Kailash Pandya adapted the play as Bhungal Vinani Bhavai, which was staged at Natarani, Ahmedabad the same year. In the production, Archan Trivedi played the role of Jivram Bhatt. The play was staged at R. V. Pathak Hall of Gujarati Sahitya Parishad, Ahmedabad on 21 January 2007. It was directed by Gujarati writer and dramatist Mahendrasinh Parmar. Reception Considered to be a milestone in the development of Gujarati drama, Mithyabhiman is the first humorous play in Gujarati language.

He is perhaps best known for his 1916 boxing match against Jack Dempsey, and his 1933 performance as Bumbo, the titular character in the Our Gang comedy short The Kid From Borneo. Early life and boxing career Johnson was born in Aug. 13, 1893, in Suffolk, Virginia, one of 11 children. During World War I Johnson served in the 367th Infantry, a Buffalo Soldier outfit of the United States Army. From 1912-1929, Johnson amassed a professional boxing record of 39-29-6, with 23 of his wins by knockout. In 1916 Johnson fought future world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey to a 10-round draw, during which Dempsey suffered several broken ribs. Although a draw, Dempsey later said, \\"I thought he [Johnson] licked me. I didn't know how to fight then and Johnson did. Yes, I think he won.\\" Johnson also had fights against the notable boxers Harry Wills, Kid Norfolk, and Bill Tate. Acting career Colorized image of John Lester Johnson as Bumbo, in The Kid From Borneo Johnson appeared in the 1933 Our Gang comedy The Kid From Borneo as Bumbo, a circus attraction billed as a \\"Wild Man from Borneo.\\" Garbed in elaborate tribal attire and repetitively saying \\"Yum Yum, eat 'em up!\\" at the sight of candy, Bumbo is mistaken by some of the caucasian Our Gang children as both a cannibal and their Uncle George, the latter earlier described by their mother as \\"the black sheep of the family.\\" A frenetic chase ensues when Bumbo attempts to take the children's candy, during which he and the children demolish much of a home's furnishings. Along with two Three Stooges films, Johnson's other film credits include Radio Patrol (1932), A Scream in the Night (1934), The Glory Trail (1936), Tarzan's Revenge (1938), Mr. Washington Goes to Town (1942), and Professor Creeps (1942). Illness and Death In a 1960 article published in Ebony, Johnson disclosed that following his acting career he worked as a special officer at Cheli Air Force Station, and that he suffered a series of disabling strokes in the late 1950s, resulting in partial paralysis. Johnson lived at the Veterans Administration Hospital in West Los Angeles until his death in 1968. Johnson is interred at the Evergreen Cemetery in Los Angeles.

Early life Hanley graduated from St. Bonaventure University in 1968 with a journalism degree. In 1969-1970, he served as a U.S. Army journalist, including in wartime Vietnam. Journalism career Hanley joined the AP's Albany, New York bureau in 1968, returning there in 1971 after military service. In 1976, he transferred to the AP's international news desk in New York, where he eventually became a roving international correspondent, reporting on subjects ranging from wars and summit conferences to climate change in the Arctic In 1987-1992 he served as AP assistant and deputy managing editor. =No Gun Ri= In 1998, Hanley and reporters Choe Sang-hun and Martha Mendoza, assisted by researcher Randy Herschaft, confirmed that the U.S. military massacred South Korean refugees ‚Äì an estimated 250‚Äì300, the South Korean government later concluded ‚Äì near No Gun Ri, South Korea, in late July 1950. The AP team had located a dozen U.S. Army veterans, witnesses, who corroborated the account of Korean survivors. The reporters also uncovered declassified archival U.S. military documents ordering the shooting of civilians, out of fear of enemy infiltrators. The story was not published until September 1999, after a year-long struggle with an AP leadership reluctant to run such an explosive report. The AP team subsequently won 11 major journalism awards, including the Pulitzer and a Polk Award. =Iraq reporting= In the years after the 9/11 terror attacks, Hanley reported extensively on the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Before the 2003 U.S. invasion, he reported from Iraq on the lack of evidence of weapons of mass destruction in that country, discrediting official U.S. claims.

It has been recorded from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, Macaronesia, and North and South America. Taxonomy The lichen was first described in the scientific literature as Parmelia nilgherrensis by William Nylander in 1874. This taxon was later (1875) transferred by Ferdinand Arold into Imbricaria (a now obsolete genus name sunk into Anaptychia). However, Nylander's 1874 publication of this species is an illegitimate homonym, as he had previously published this name with a different type in 1869. In 1924, Gustaf Einar Du Rietz described the same taxon as Parmelia arnoldii. Mason Hale transferred it to Parmotrema in 1974, as part of a taxonomic transfer of all species in Parmelia subgenus Parmelia section Irregulare. It is commonly known as the powdered ruffle lichen. Description Parmotrema arnoldii has a pale grey thallus comprising lobes that measure 6‚Äì15 mmm wide. The thallus lacks maculae (spots or lines free of photobiont). There are soralia present on the upper surface of the tips of the lobes, which causes them to curl downwards. The lobes, especially those lacking soredia, have abundant, long cilia. The lower surface of the thallus (the subthallus) is black to brown and has a naked marginal zone (i.e. without rhizines). Secondary compounds present are atranorin, alectoronic and Œ±-collatolic acids, sometimes accompanied also by skyrin. =Similar species= Parmotrema margaritatum is identical in appearance, but it has salazinic acid. Cetrelia chicitae is similar in morphology to Parmotrema arnoldii and produces the same secondary substances. However, unlike P. arnoldii, it has pseudocyphellae and thallus margins without cilia. Habitat and distribution Parmotrema arnoldii is widely distributed, and has been recorded from temperate locations in Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, Macaronesia, and North and South America. Typically growing among mosses that associate with plants, often on old shrubs or horizontal tree branches, the lichen prefers relatively well-lit and humid undisturbed woodlands.

She works with collections of information or data, particularly self- generated data sets, to create new and unusual narratives in a variety of mediums. Her work has been exhibited widely at cultural institutions including the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tate Modern, Barbican Centre, Centre Pompidou, Hek Basel, The Photographers' Gallery, ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, and Ars Electronica. Biography Born in London in 1985, Ridler spent her childhood raised between Atlanta, Georgia and the United Kingdom. She obtained a Master of Arts in Information Experience Design from the Royal College of Art in 2017 and a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Language from Oxford University in 2007.  Art  A core element of her work lies in the creation of handmade data sets through a laborious process of selecting and classifying images and text. By creating her own data sets, Ridler is able to uncover and expose underlying themes and concepts while also inverting the usual process of scraping pre-classified images found in large databases on the internet. Her interests are in drawing, machine learning, data collection, storytelling, and technology. Selected works Some of Anna Ridler's most notable works to date fall within her ‚Äòtulip series‚Äô which explores the hysteria around tulip mania and compares it to the speculation and bubbles surrounding cryptocurrencies today. The series is expressed in three forms: a photographic dataset in Myriad (Tulips), 2018; two iterations of machine generated videos in Mosaic Virus (2018) and Mosaic Virus (2019); and a website with an accompanied functioning decentralized application in Bloemenveiling (2019). = Myriad (Tulips) (2018) = Myriad (Tulips) (2018) is an installation of ten thousand hand-labeled photographs forming a dataset of unique tulips. The ten thousand, or myriad of, photographs were taken by Ridler over the course of three months, roughly the length of a tulip season, spent in Utrecht. Each photograph is carefully affixed one by one with magnets to a specially painted black wall in a laborious process to form a seemingly precise grid. Exhibited in AI: More than Human, Barbican Centre, London, UK (May 16 - August 26, 2019); Error‚ÄîThe Art of Imperfection, Ars Electronica Export, Berlin, Germany (November 17, 2018 ‚Äì March 3, 2019); Peer to Peer, Shanghai Centre of Photography, Shanghai, China (December 8 - February 9, 2020). Featured in Financial Times, Google Arts & Culture, Bloomberg, It‚Äôs Nice That and Hyperallergic. Nominated for a Beazley Design of the Year award for her presentation of an alternative perspective on how to engage with artificial intelligence; demonstrating a departure from ownership and control of major corporations to a more personalized process of constructing and conceptualizing from the ground-up. = Mosaic Virus (2018, 2019) = Mosaic Virus (2018) is a single screen video installation displaying a grid of continually evolving tulips in bloom. For Mosaic Virus (2019) Ridler used three screens. The appearance of the tulips is controlled by artificial intelligence using fluctuations in the price of bitcoin. The stripes on the petals reflecting the value of the cryptocurrency. She draws parallels with the tulip mania of the 17th century; representing the hysteria and speculation around crypto-currencies. The work takes its name from the mosaic virus which caused stripes in tulip petals, subsequently increasing their desirability and leading to speculative prices. Ridler trained a general adversarial network (GAN) on the set of ten thousand photographs of individual tulips from her work Myriad (Tulips). She used a technique called spectral normalization to improve the output. The work was exhibited in Error‚ÄîThe Art of Imperfection, Ars Electronica Export, Berlin, Germany (November 17, 2018 ‚Äì March 3, 2019). = Bloemenveiling (2019) = Bloemenveiling (2019) is an auction of artificial-intelligence-generated tulips on the blockchain in the form of a functioning decentralized application: http://bloemenveiling.bid. Ridler collaborated with senior research scientist at DeepMind, David Pfau to investigate whether blockchain could be used as a means of finding poetic substance within it. The piece interrogates the way technology drives human desire and economic dynamics by creating artificial scarcity. In the work, short moving image pieces of tulips created by generative adversarial networks are sold at auction using smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Each time a tulip is sold, thousands of computers around the world all work to verify the transaction, checking each other's work against each other. While the artificial intelligence behind the moving image pieces has the potential to generate infinite flowers, the enormous distributed network is used, at great environmental cost, to introduce scarcity to an otherwise limitless resource.

Sorghum is grown mainly in Africa and Asia with some areas also in southern Europe. The adult fly lays eggs on the underside of the leaf of the host plant. A female may lay about 75 eggs. The eggs hatch in a week and the larva moves to the central whorl and feeds on the growing tip, resulting in the plant failing to grow. The larvae pupate after about 17 days and adults may emerge after another 11 days under warm conditions. Many efforts have been made to breed crop varieties that are resistant to shoot fly attack. Altering the season of planting can also be effective under some conditions as the flies only attack young seedlings. The adults can be monitored using bait consisting of fish-meal (with fish oil), brewer's yeast and ammonium sulphide. Attempts have also been made to augment natural predators and parasites to manage or reduce damage to crops.

A miniature from the Book of the Election to the Kingdom of the Great Russian Tsar of the Great Sovereign and Grand Prince Prince Mikhail Feodorovich of All Great Russian Autocracy. 1673 The Zemsky Sobor of 1613 was a meeting of representatives of various lands and estates of the Russian State, held for the election of a new king to the throne. It was opened on January 16, 1613 in the Assumption Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin. On March 3, 1613, the Sobor elected Mikhail Romanov to the kingdom, laying the foundation for a new dynasty. Zemsky Sobors Zemsky Sobors convened in Russia repeatedly over the course of a century and a half ‚Äì from the middle of the 16th to the end of the 17th century (finally abolished by Peter I). However, in all other cases, they played the role of an advisory body under the current monarch and, in fact, did not limit its absolute power. The Zemsky Sobor of 1613 was convened in a dynastic crisis. Its main task was to elect and legitimize the new dynasty on the Russian throne. Background The dynastic crisis in Russia erupted in 1598 after the death of Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich. At the time of his death, Fedor remained the only son of Tsar Ivan the Terrible. Two other sons were killed: the eldest, Ivan Ioannovich, died in 1581, allegedly at the hands of his father; the youngest, Dmitry Ioannovich, in 1591 in Uglich under obscure circumstances. Fedor did not have his own children. After his death, the throne passed to the king's wife, Irina, then to her brother Boris Godunov. After the death of Boris in 1605, they successively ruled: *The son of Boris, Fedor Godunov; *False Dmitry I (true origin is controversial); *Vasily Shuisky. After the overthrow of Vasily Shuisky from the throne as a result of the July 27, 1610 uprising, power in Moscow passed to the interim boyar government (see Semiboyarschina). In August 1610, part of the population of Moscow swore allegiance to Prince Vladislav, the son of the Polish king and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III. In September, the army of the Commonwealth entered the Kremlin. The actual power of the Moscow government in the years 1610‚Äì1612 was minimal. Anarchy reigned in the country, the north-western lands (including Novgorod) were occupied by Swedish troops. In Tushino near Moscow, the Tushino camp of another impostor, False Dmitry II, continued to function. The camp operated until March 1610, but from December 1609 he refused to support the Impostors and supported the Polish king. In March 1610, the Tushino camp was defeated. False Dmitry II was killed in Kaluga in December 1610. To liberate Moscow from the invaders, the First People's Militia (under the leadership of Prokopy Lyapunov, Ivan Zarutsky and Prince Dmitry Trubetskoy), and then the Second People's Militia led by Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, consistently gathered. In August 1612, the Second Militia, with part of the forces remaining near Moscow from the First Militia, defeated the army of the Commonwealth, and in October completely liberated the capital. Convocation of the Sobor On November 5, 1612, in Moscow, deprived of support from the main forces of Hetman Khodkevich, the garrison of troops of the Commonwealth capitulated. After the liberation of the capital, it became necessary to choose a new sovereign. Letters were sent from Moscow to many cities of Russia on behalf of the liberators of Moscow ‚Äì Pozharsky and Trubetskoy. Historians received information about the documents sent to Sol Vychegodskaya, Pskov, Novgorod, Uglich. These letters dated mid-November 1612 ordered the representatives of each city to arrive in Moscow until December 6. However, the elected for a long time gathered from the distant ends of the still boiling Russia. Some lands (for example, Tverskaya) were devastated and completely burned. Someone sent 10‚Äì15 people, someone just one representative. The deadline for opening meetings of the Zemsky Sobor was postponed from December 6 to January 6. In dilapidated Moscow, the only building left that could accommodate all the elected was the Assumption Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin. The number of participants varies according to various estimates from 700 to 1,500 people. Candidates for the throne The approved letter of the Zemsky Sobor on the election of Mikhail Fedorovich to the royal throne In 1613, in addition to Mikhail Romanov, representatives of the local nobility and representatives of the ruling dynasties of neighboring countries claimed the Russian throne. Among the latter, candidates for the throne were: *Polish prince Vladislav, son of Sigismund III; *Swedish prince Carl Philip, son of Charles IX. Among the representatives of the local nobility, the following surnames stood out. As can be seen from the list above, they all had serious flaws in the eyes of voters: *Golitsyns. This genus came from Gediminas of Lithuania, but the absence of Vasily Golitsyn (he was held captive in Warsaw) deprived this genus of strong candidates; *Mstislavsky and Kurakin families. Representatives of these noble Russian clans undermined their reputation by collaborating with the authorities of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Semiboyarschina); *Vorotynsky family. According to the official version, the most influential representative of this genus, Ivan Vorotynsky, recused himself; *Godunov and Shuysky families. Both those and others were relatives of the previously ruling monarchs. The Shuysky family, in addition, came from Rurik. However, kinship with the ousted rulers was fraught with a certain danger: ascending to the throne, the elect could be carried away by the reduction of political accounts with opponents. *Dmitry Cherkassky; *Dmitry Pozharsky and Dmitry Trubetskoy. They undoubtedly glorified their names during the assault on Moscow, but many were afraid of them, and they were not relatives of Ivan the Terrible and Fedor Ivanovich. Although Trubetskoy was from the Gediminids, he undermined his authority among the nobility by the command of the Cossacks, who at the last moment did not support his claim to the throne, so that there would be no turmoil among themselves, as part of them supported Cherkassky. Pozharsky, although he came from the princes of Starodubsky, but in the years of the oprichnina his family was in disgrace and fell considerably in matters of Mestnichestvo. But, most importantly, he was feared as one of the few governors who had never been tarnished by cooperation with False Dmitriy and interventionists, and this united Tushins, Cossacks and former members of the seven-boyars against him, and, most importantly, he did not put forward his candidacy. In addition, the candidacy of Marina Mnishek and her son from a marriage with False Dmitry II, nicknamed \\"Vorenok\\", was considered. Motives for the election According to the point of view officially recognized during the Romanov era (and later rooted in Soviet historiography), the council voluntarily, expressing the opinion of the majority of Russian residents, decided to elect Romanov, in accordance with the majority opinion. This point of view was developed by the historian Nikolai Lavrovsky, who, having studied the reports of sources, built the following scheme of events. Initially, the participants in the council decided not to choose the king from Lithuania and Sweden \\"with their children and Marinka with her son, as well as all foreign sovereigns\\", but \\"choose from Moscow and Russian clans\\". Then the participants of the Sobor began to discuss the question of whom to choose \\"from the Russian clans\\" and decided to \\"elect the tsar from the tribe of the righteous... blessed memory of Feodor Ivanovich of all Russia\\" ‚Äì his nephew Mikhail Romanov. This description of the work of the Sobor was repeated many times, right up to the beginning of the 20th century. This position was held, in particular, by the largest Russian historians of the 18th ‚Äì 20th centuries: Nikolay Karamzin, Sergey Solovyov, Nikolay Kostomarov, Vasily Tatishchev and others. Course of the meetings The cathedral opened on January 16th. The discovery was preceded by a three-day fast, the purpose of which was the cleansing of the sins of troubles. Moscow was almost completely destroyed and ruined, so they settled, regardless of their origin, who could where. Everyone converged in the Assumption Cathedral day after day. The interests of the Romanovs at the cathedral were defended by the boyar Fedor Sheremetev. Being a relative of the Romanovs (Mikhail Romanov was a relative of the largest number of other candidates) and a candidate for the throne, he, however, from the point of view of the Cossacks, could not successfully aspire to the throne, since, like some other candidates, he was part of the Seven Boyars. One of the first decisions of the council was the refusal to consider the candidatures of Vladislav and Karl Philip, as well as Marina Mnishek: But even after such a decision, the Romanovs were still confronted by many strong candidates. Of course, all of them had one or another shortcoming (see above). However, the Romanovs also had an important drawback ‚Äì in comparison with the old Russian clans, they clearly did not shine with origin. The first historically reliable ancestor of the Romanovs is traditionally considered the Moscow boyar Andrei Kobyla, according to the Romanovs and the Sheremetevs and many other Moscow clans originating from him, who came from the Prussian princely family. =First version= Mikhail Fedorovich after being elected to the kingdom According to the official version, the election of the Romanovs became possible due to the fact that the candidacy of Mikhail Romanov was a compromise in many respects: *Having received a young, inexperienced monarch on the Moscow throne, the boyars could hope to exert pressure on the king in resolving key issues; *Mikhail's father, Patriarch Filaret, was for some time in the camp of False Dmitry II. This gave hope to defectors from the Tushino camp that Mikhail would not settle accounts with them; *Patriarch Filaret, in addition, enjoyed undoubted authority among the clergy; *The Romanov clan was less tarnished by collaboration with the \\"unpatriotic\\" Polish government in 1610‚Äì1612. Although Ivan Romanov was part of the Seven Boyars, he was in opposition to his other relatives (in particular, Patriarch Filaret and Mikhail Fedorovich) and did not support them at the council; *The most liberal period of his reign was connected with Anastasia Zakharyina-Yurieva, the first wife of Tsar Ivan the Terrible. Lev Gumilyov more consistently outlines the reasons for the election of Mikhail Romanov to the kingdom: =Other versions= The approved letter of Zemsky Sobor on the election of Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich. Moscow, May 1613. Museum of the Moscow Kremlin. It was written in 2 copies in the form of scrolls, certified by the signatures of more than 230 participants of the Sobor (on the back) and seals of the clergy. At the moment, one of them consists of 9 sheets, in the photo ‚Äì the 1st sheet According to some historians, the decision of the Sobor was not completely voluntary. The first vote on the candidacy of Michael took place on February 4 (or 7). The result of the vote deceived Sheremetev's expectations: > \\"When the majority was sufficiently prepared by Sheremetev's concerns, a > preliminary vote was appointed on February 4. The result undoubtedly > deceived expectations, therefore, referring to the absence of many voters, > they decided to decisively vote postponed for two weeks... The leaders > themselves obviously needed a respite in order to better prepare public > opinion\\"... (Kazimir Valishevsky) Indeed, a decisive vote was set for March 3, 1613. The Sobor, however, made another decision that was not pleasing to Sheremetev: it demanded that Mikhail Romanov, like all other candidates, immediately appear at the Sobor. Sheremetev in every possible way impeded the implementation of this decision, motivating his position with security considerations. Indeed, some evidence indicates that the life of the candidate for the throne was in jeopardy. According to legend, a special detachment of the troops of the Commonwealth was sent to the village of Domnino, where Mikhail Fedorovich was hiding, to kill him, however, the Domnian peasant Ivan Susanin saved the life of the future king. Critics of the official version offer another explanation: > \\"Deprived of all education among the turbulent events surrounding his > childhood and early youth, probably not being able to read or write, Mikhail > could have spoiled everything by appearing in front of the Sobor\\" (Kazimir > Valishevsky) The Sobor continued to insist, but later (tentatively February 17‚Äì18) changed the decision, allowing Mikhail Romanov to stay in Kostroma. And on March 3, 1613, it elected Romanov to the kingdom. =Cossack intervention= February 20, 1613. On the porch of the Annunciation Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin, Kelar of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra, Abraham Palitsyn, reads out the decision of the Zemsky Sobor \\"On the election of the boyar Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov to the royal throne\\". (\\"The Book of the Election of the Tsar and Grand Duke Mikhail Fedorovich\\", 1672‚Äì1673) Some evidence points to a possible reason for this change. On February 10, 1613, two merchants arrived in Novgorod, reporting the following: > \\"The Russian Cossacks, who are in Moscow, wished to be the Grand Dukes of a > boyar named Prince Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov. But the boyars were > completely against it and rejected it at the Council, which was recently > convened in Moscow\\". (Leo Cherepnin) And here is the testimony of the peasant Fyodor Bobyrkin, who also arrived in Novgorod, dated July 26, 1613 ‚Äì five days after the coronation: > \\"Moscow ordinary people and Cossacks, of their own free will and without the > general consent of other zemstvo officials, chose Grand Duke Fedorov's son, > Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov, who is now in Moscow. Zemsky ranks and boyars do > not respect him\\". (Leo Cherepnin) The Lithuanian commander Lev Sapega reported the results of the election to the prisoner Filaret, the father of the newly elected monarch: > \\"Only your Cossacks donors sent your son to the Moscow state\\". (Sergey > Platonov) Here's a story written by another eyewitness to the events. > \\"The boyars pulled time at the Sobor, trying to solve the question of the > king secretly from the Cossacks and waiting for their departure from Moscow. > But they not only did not leave, but behaved more actively. Once, having > consulted \\"with all the Cossack army\\", they sent up to five hundred people > to the Krutitsy Metropolitan. Having forcibly broken the gates, burst into > his courtyard and, using rude words, demanded: \\"Give us, Metropolitan, the > Tsar to Russia, whom we worship and serve, and ask for their salaries, die > to death with a smooth death!\\" (Romanovs, Historical Porters, edited by > Elena Leonova) The terrified metropolitan fled to the boyars. Hastily convened everyone at the Sobor. Cossack chieftains repeated their demand. The boyars presented them with a list of eight boyars ‚Äì the most worthy candidates, in their opinion. The list included Prince Fyodor Mstislavsky, Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, Prince Dmitry Trubetskoy, Prince Peter Pronsky, Prince Ivan Vorotynsky, Prince Ivan Cherkassky, Fedor Sheremetev, Ivan Romanov, and Mikhail Romanov was not.Andrey Pavlov. The Ruling Circles of Russia at the Final Stage of the Time of Troubles // Bulletin of Saint Petersburg University. History. 2018. Volume 63. Issue 3. Pages 729‚Äì747 Then one of the Cossack chieftains spoke: > \\"Princes and boyars and all Moscow nobles! Not by God's will, but by > sovereignty and of your own free will, you choose the autocratic. But > according to God's will and with the blessing of... Grand Duke Fyodor > Ivanovich of all Russia, with his blessed memory, to whom he, sovereign, > bless your tsar's staff and rule Prince Fedor Nikitich Romanov in Russia. > And he is now captivated in Lithuania. And from the gracious root and the > industry is kind and honor ‚Äì his son Prince Mikhailo Fedorovich. May it be > according to God's will on the reigning city of Moscow and all Russia, that > there will be a Tsar sovereign and Grand Duke Mikhailo Fedorovich of all > Russia...\\" (ibid.) Embassy to Kostroma On March 2, an embassy under the leadership of the Ryazan archbishop Feodorit Troitsky was sent to Mikhail Romanov and his mother on behalf of Zemsky Sobor to Kostroma. The embassy included archimandrites of the Chudov, Novospassky, Simonov monasteries, the boyars Fyodor Sheremetev, Vladimir Bakhteyarov-Rostovsky, boyar children, and orderly people elected from cities.Palace Categories. Volume 1. Saint Petersburg, 1850. Columns 17‚Äì18 The purpose of the embassy was to inform Michael of his election to the throne and to give him a Sobor oath. According to the official version, Mikhail was frightened and flatly refused to reign, so the ambassadors had to show all their eloquence in order to convince the future king to accept the crown. Critics of the \\"Romanov\\" concept express doubts about the sincerity of rejection and note that the conciliar oath has no historical value: One way or another, Michael agreed to take the throne and went to Moscow, where he arrived on May 12, 1613. The coronation in Moscow took place on July 21, 1613.Palace Categories. Volume 1. Saint Petersburg, 1850.

Its inhabitants are primarily Maronite Catholics.  Etymology  The name \\"Jernaya\\" is a Syriac phrase directly translated as \\"from the gurnaye\\". Gurnaye is the plural of gurna: the bark, mortar, and plunge pits in rock.. Its demonym is Jernayoites (French) and ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàŸä (Arabic), transliterated as Jernaoui.  Geography  Jernaya is located 17 km from Saida, and 57 km from Beirut. It is administratively part of the caza (Arabic: qada) of Jezzine. It is separated by a valley to the South from the governorate of Nabatiye. It has a surface area of 231 hectares. Jernaya is completely surrounded by Muslim Shia villages, except for the Maronite town of Kfar Chelal. It borders the villages of Kfar Beit, Kfar Melki, and Kfar Fila Being 460 m above sea level, Jernaya has a mild Mediterranean mountainous climate (slightly cooler than Saida). On rare occasions, snowfall can occur between the months of December to February, however it usually melts within 24 hours.  Demographics  Jernaya's inhabitants are almost exclusively Maronite Catholics, with a Greek Catholic minority. Most villagers only live in Jernaya during Summer, and have jobs in neighboring Saida or Beirut. As the Lebanese government has not conducted a census since 1932, there is no official data on the population of any Lebanese city. According to the 2017 electoral roll (which only include people aged 21+), there are 1390 voters: * 1358 Maronite Catholics * 32 Greek Catholics  Government  Jernaya is a municipality as defined by the Lebanese Ministry of Interior and Municipalities. The government consists of a mukhtar and a municipal council made up of 12 members. Following the 2016 municipal elections, its members are: Jean Aboud (president), Joe Antoun, Johnny Khoury, Joseph Azar, Elias Abi-Nahm, Jean Smaan, Charbel Hayek, Jean Saouaya, Nemr Hayek, Claude Hayek, George Jabbour, and Marie Najm. Following a petition by the citizens of Jernaya, the Ministry of Agriculture published a decree stating that goats and livestock from neighboring villages are forbidden from entering the territory of the municipality (decree No. 11 on the 03/14/1996). There are two voter circonscriptions in Jernaya: Public School Room No. 1 and Public School Room No. 2. They have 640 and 618 members on their electoral rolls, respectively. = 2016 municipal election = Two competing lists, each made up of 12 candidates, ran for the 12 seats of the municipal council. All members of List 1 were elected. * List 1's leader: Jean Abboud (475 votes) * List 2's leader: Fady Hayek (231 votes)  Attractions  Municipal cemetery Jernaya has a full-size basketball court on the Southeastern side (directly below the cemetery), and a community rec center located on the ground floor of the municipality located downtown. There are two churches: Notre-Dame-de- Sainte-Marie (Our Lady of Saint Mary) and St. Elie chapel. The cathedral Notre-Dame-de-Jernaya (Our Lady of Jernaya) is currently under construction on the Eastern side of the village. The hotel Erzel-Jernaya (ÿπÿ±ÿ≤ÿßŸÑ ÿ¨ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸäÿß) is located in the lush valley on the Southern border of the village. The valley, which separates the Nabatiye and South-Lebanon governorates with a river running through its trough, is completely vegetated as construction is forbidden to preserve its character. It is an ideal spot for hunting, hiking, and camping. The municipal cemetery (of Maronite confession) is located on the Eastern side of Jernaya. It contains a crypt for the deceased, numerous tomb vaults, and the mausoleum of General Elie Hayek. Saint-Elie chapel is located directly at the entrance of the cemetery. A swimming pool and tennis court complex is currently being built at the municipality's Eastern border.

She was a Professor for Art and Art Mediation at Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design in Halle from 1994 to 2018.  Life  Una H. Moehrke studied Painting at the Berlin University of the Arts (graduated in 1980 as a Master Student of Raimund Girke), along with Art History, Religious History, and Philosophy at the Free University of Berlin. She has received stipends from the Berlin Senate, the State of Lower Saxony, and the German Academic Exchange Service and prizes from the Ilse Augustin Foundation, Berlin, the Federal Garden Exhibition in Berlin, and the Baer Art Center, Iceland. After lectureships and guest professorships in Berlin, L√ºneburg, Kiel, Braunschweig, and Dresden, she was appointed a Professor at the Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design in Halle in 1994. There she taught until 2018 in the Faculty of Art and was a Professor for Art and Art Mediation Art Education. Ulf Aminde, Irmela Gertsen, Georg Lisek, Julian Plodek, Luise von Rohden, Juliane Schickedanz, Jochen Schneider, Ella Ziegler and others were taught by Moehrke. Along with her teaching, Moehrke pursued her own painting and drawing. Moehrke is a member of the International Artists Bureau and an associate member of the German Artists Association. She lives in Berlin.  Teaching  As an instructor, Moehrke combined in an experimental and multi- media manner societally related art mediation with artistic interventions in museums, galleries, theaters, and the world of work. Her teaching is based on the experience that artistic work is carried out in dialog with biographical and art-reflecting processes. In the framework of symposiums and catalog publications, she has realized research projects involving multiple steps. In the 2008 project Geometry of Work, . she presented artistic research and reflection processes on the heterogeneity of the current concept of work and its various manifestations, as well as documenting artistic transfer projects in concrete work milieus. A symposium in the Gallery for Contemporary Art (GfZK) in Leipzig discussed the geometry of work from its sociological, art- theoretical, and economic perspectives. At the center of another art- theoretical research project, Im Modus der Gabe (In the Mode of the Gift), 2011, stand models from theater, visual art, and performance, in which processes of exchange, transfer, and reciprocity are effective. Considering the performative development of contemporary art, the contributions examine the degree to which concepts of the gift that develop from ethnological, philosophical, and sociological perspectives (Marcel Mauss, Maurice Godelier, Jacques Derrida, Bruno Latour, Paul Ric≈ìur, etc.) prove viable for reflecting on the self-understanding of contemporary artistic practice in the field of tension between social effectiveness and the claim to autonomy. The exhibition and event series erreger-  EIGEN frequenz (agent or pathogen ‚Äì eigenfrequency), 2018, on the perception, mediation, and visibility of giving, taking, and passing on, is Moehrke's last presentation in the context of her teaching. In interplay with the works of the Professor, twenty-seven different positions on the phenomenon of giving and the principle of impulse and resonance were presented in the Burg Gallery Halle.  Oeuvre  Starting with the photographic and performative Self-Portrait on the Surface of the Water (1980s), the Moehrke continued to develop self-portraits as abstract heads in oil painting (end of the 1990s). From the original head and mirror image Icon, she extrapolated abstract surfaces that present themselves as mostly monochromatic pictures. Moehrke works with the reduction of line and color fields. In painting, the dematerialization of color produces shifting color fields that offer reflection surfaces for light and shadow like a mirror and that change with the changing position of the viewer. These are pictures that oscillate between appearance and disappearance. The viewer perceives them as the trace of a motion. With extremely reduced coloration, they open up spaces whose atmosphere is reminiscent of phenomena of light. The viewer can associate motion within the picture with the physical motion outside of the picture (PictureSpaceMotion, 2010). Her pictures painted since 2012 with metal pigments that seem white are her primary works, a further extended reduction of monochromy. Beginning with the performative water drawings of the 1990s, Moehrke designed a large-format, experimental form of drawing that can be categorized as site-specific art and that stands in dialog with nature and architectonic environments, for example industrial architecture, sacred buildings, or park facilities. Moehrke says drawings can grasp something ungraspable. In them, the lines condense to emblems and, in some work complexes, refer to examples from art history. Thus, in Venice in 2015, the drawings were fragmentarily transposed from historical paintings into a free and contemporary language of lines. With small, linear interventions, tradition is transferred to contemporaneity (Personal Structures. Crossing Borders: These lines are dedicated to... Palazzo Bembo, 56th International Art Exhibition, la Biennale di Venezia, Venice 2015). Moehrke's art develops dialogically in the media of performance, photography, painting, drawing, and text.

History The Airport Police were formed on 1 April 1961 when control of the Airport passed from the Ministry of Civil Aviation to Liverpool City Council. The existing Ministry of Civil Aviation Constabulary officers were transferred to other Airports still operated by the Ministry. Unlike the City's Parks Police, no provision was made in any of the Liverpool Corporation Acts for the swearing in of constables for the Airport, so they were instead sworn in as special constables of the main Liverpool City Police force. The force operated a variety of vehicles, including a Vespa scooter, Land Rover, and later a Mini van and BMC J4 patrol car. The vehicles were notable for featuring a dark blue livery with a yellow roof, and an amber flashing light, rather than the normal blue. The force introduced personal radios in 1967. In 1972, the force consisted of one Superintendent, four sergeants and 15 constables, of which four were dog handlers. On 31 March 1972, the force was disbanded (along with the city's Parks Police force) and merged into a new civilian \\"Liverpool Corporation Security Force\\". Individual officers retained their status as special constables. On 1 April 1974, control of the airport passed to the new Merseyside County Council, and the force became the Airport Security Force. The officers lost their status as special constables in 1978.

The gens Statilia was a plebeian family of Lucanian origin at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the third century BC, when one of them led the Lucanian assault on the city of Thurii, and another commanded an allied cavalry troop during the Second Punic War; but at Rome the Statilii first come to attention in the time of Cicero, at which point they held equestrian rank. The first of the family to attain the consulship was Titus Statilius Taurus in 37 BC, and his descendants continued to fill the highest offices of the Roman state until the time of Marcus Aurelius.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 901 (\\"Statilia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Statilius belongs to a class of gentilicia ending in the suffix ', derived from other names ending in the diminutive suffix '.Chase, pp. 122, 123. Statilius is a derivative of the common Oscan praenomen Statius, the diminutive of which may have been Statulus. The same praenomen also gave rise to the Statia gens.Chase, pp. 131, 136, 137. Praenomina The earliest Statilii bore common Oscan praenomina, such as Sthenius (or Statius) and Marius. In the late Republic, we find Lucius and Quintus, both among the most common praenomina throughout all periods of Roman history. The consular families from the first centuries of the Empire used Titus to the exclusion of all other regular praenomina, although two of the Statilii Tauri exchanged their original praenomina for the names Sisenna and Taurus. In the case of Taurus, the name was simply the cognomen of the family used as a praenomen, while Sisenna commemorated the descent of the family from the Cornelii Sisennae, a noble family of the Republic, through a female line. Branches and cognomina The most important branch of the Statilii bore the cognomen Taurus, referring to a bull, and belonging to a large class of surnames derived from the names of animals and everyday objects.Chase, pp. 112, 113. This family remained prominent from the end of the Republic to the reign of Claudius, and its name appears on coins of the era. Corvinus, borne as a surname by one of the consular Statilii, was inherited from his grandfather, Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, consul in 31 BC, a descendant of the illustrious house of the Valerii Messallae, and of Marcus Valerius Corvus, who obtained his cognomen when, as a young soldier, he defeated a giant Gaul in single combat, with the apparently divine intervention of a raven, or corvus.Livy, vii. 26.Dionysius, xv. 1. A later family of the Statilii bore the cognomina Maximus and Severus, both common surnames throughout Roman history. Titus Statilius Maximus Severus Hadrianus, consul in AD 115, was the descendant of wealthy Syrian colonists.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 319. Maximus, the superlative of Magnus, \\"great\\", could have described someone of great stature or high achievement, but was more often used to designate the eldest of several brothers.Chase, p. 111. Severus was used to describe someone whose manner was \\"stern\\" or \\"serious\\". Members Titus Statilius Taurus built the first stone amphitheatre built at Rome. It stood from 30 BC to the Great Fire in AD 64. * Sthenius or Statius Statilius, the leader of the Lucanians against Thurii early in the third century BC. At Rome, the tribune of the plebs Gaius Aelius passed a measure condemning Statilius, for which he was honoured by the Thurians.Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, xxxiv. 6. s. 15.Valerius Maximus, i. 8. ¬ß 6.Broughton, vol. I, p. 187. * Marius Statilius, the leader of a Lucanian cavalry troop, serving under the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus in 216 BC, during the Second Punic War. After Paullus and his army were destroyed at the Battle of Cannae, Statilius questioned his devotion to the Roman cause, until reassured by the praises of Quintus Fabius Maximus.Livy, xxii. 42, 43.Frontinus, Strategemata, iv. 7. ¬ß 36.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Fabius Maximus\\", 20.Broughton, vol.

He sometimes used the alias of John Rogers. Plunket was born in Dublin in 1664 and brought up as a Roman Catholic. He was sent to be educated at the Jesuits' College at Vienna.Thomas Seccombe, ‚ÄúPlunket, John‚Äù in Dictionary of National Biography, Vol. 45 (1896) After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Plunket spent over twenty years in the service of leading Jacobites, sometimes as a spy and sometimes as a diplomatic agent of James II, building up a wide acquaintance with the statesmen of many European countries. He received many promises of support. The hopes of the Jacobites were raised by the defeat of the Whigs in Great Britain in 1710, strengthening the position of the new Tory government. Many believed Robert Harley was at heart a Jacobite, and negotiations begun with the France of Louis XIV in the autumn of 1711 were seen as leading to secret negotiations with James Francis Edward Stuart, the Pretender. Plunket worked to promote the Jacobite cause by revealing Whig plotting to the Tories. In January 1712, Prince Eugene of Savoy came to England and had meetings at Leicester House with Marlborough, the imperial envoy Gallas, and leading Hanoverians. In March 1712, Plunket sent Harley two forged letters appearing to be from Eug√®ne to Count Zinzendorf, the imperial ambassador at The Hague, to go to Vienna. These claimed that the Whigs were planning the assassination of Tory leaders and other outrages. Harley was not deceived, but Prince Eug√®ne became unpopular in England, and the letters were used to persuade Torcy and the French negotiators at Utrecht, of the dangers of peace against the wishes of a powerful faction. Plunket, disappointed, brought his forged revelations to Harcourt and the Duke of Buckinghamshire, who shared them with the privy council. On 3 April, Plunket was called in for questioning, and said his information came from a clerk of Zinzendorf in The Hague. He was sent away with the suggestion that he went over to Holland to bring this clerk back. Jonathan Swift treats the claims as substantially true in his ‚ÄúFour closing Years of Queen Anne‚Äú. Plunket went back to the continent, visited Rome, and had meetings with the Pretender. He returned to England in 1718, and in January 1723, while lodging in Lambeth, he was charged with being a conspirator in Christopher Layer's plot for seizing the Tower of London. He was found to have written letters to Middleton, Dillon, and other prominent Jacobites, urging them to get support from the Regent of France, and promising a wide support in England. He was also accused of trying to corrupt some sergeants in the British Army. A bill ‚Äúfor inflicting certain pains and penalties upon John Plunket‚Äú had a second reading in the House of Commons on 28 March 1723, when Plunket made no defence. When it came to the House of Lords, he claimed to be an insignificant figure in Jacobite circles, but his correspondence did not support this. Plunket was imprisoned as a state prisoner in the Tower of London for many years. In July 1738, ‚Äúat the public expense he was removed into private lodgings and cut for the stone by Mr. Cheselden‚Äù, but the operation was a failure, and Plunket died in August. He was buried in the St Pancras churchyard. Notes References *Hist.

It is native to Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil where it grows near the edges of moist forests. Description Cecropia pachystachya is a small evergreen tree growing to a height of about , and a trunk diameter of . The tree has an open structure, with a small number of branches forking at an obtuse angle, and often forms a parasol-like shape. The twigs are hollow and are filled with mucilage, and both twigs and branches exude a mucilaginous sap when damaged. The large leaves are almost circular, and are deeply divided into nine to ten lobes which are separated by gaps of two or three centimetres. The upper surfaces of the leaves are rough and the lower surfaces are felted with pale-coloured hairs. It is a dioecious species, male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. The tree has a mutualistic relationship with ants from the genus Azteca which protect the tree from herbivory. To facilitate this, it provides nourishment for the ants in the form of M√ºllerian bodies, glandular areas on the leaf stalks that produce oily secretions, nectar from the female flowers and pearl bodies on the surfaces of the leaves. Distribution and habitat This tree mostly found in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina at altitudes of up to about . It grows near the margins of humid primary forests and in clearings and secondary growth forests. It is a pioneering, fast-growing but short-lived species that sprouts readily in recently cleared areas of forest. Uses Cecropia pachystachya is used locally for its timber, which is lightweight and suitable for making toys, boxes, pencils and plywood. Fibres from the bark are used for making sails and the mucilage can be used to make glue. The tree has many uses in traditional medicine and contains a number of bioactive compounds. The leaves have anti-inflammatory properties and have shown antibacterial activity in the laboratory against various bacteria. The leaves and other parts of the tree are used to treat respiratory complaints, oedema, kidney disorders, diabetes, Parkinson's disease and high blood pressure, as well as a number of other conditions.

The Black Death in Aragon is described by contemporary witnesses, such as in the chronicle of Peter IV of Aragon, and has been subjected to thorough research which has demonstrated the effect the plague could have on a society. The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached Aragon in the spring of 1348, and lasted a year. It interrupted the civil war which took place at the time, when the king was able to convince the rebels by whom he was captive to release him as they would otherwise endanger his life because of the migration of the plague. The collapse of the administration and social order lasted for several years and resulted a break down of law an order, widespread criminality, repression from the nobility and rebellions during the following century.

Most of the ponds were once wetlands in the cities of Redwood City, Newark, Hayward and other parts of the bay. Salt production goes back to when the Ohlone were the only people in the area. After the large influx of people to the area in the 1850s, industrial production began. At first, production was predominantly small family operations, but over time these were replaced by companies like the Oliver Salt Company in Mount Eden and Leslie Salt in Newark. Eventually, Cargill bought out the companies to become the dominant producer in the area. Since 2003, there has been a move to close the ponds and return the area to its natural state. This process may take as long as thirty years. Geography and fauna On the West Coast, the San Francisco Bay is one of two areas with the natural conditions from the sun and wind needed to allow for salt extraction from sea salt to be a commercially viable operation. The ponds are noted for their vivid colors, ranging from magenta to blue-green, that are especially visible from the air. The colors come from the brine shrimp and microorganisms that thrive in the different salinity levels in the ponds. In particular, synechococcus, halobacteria, and dunaliella affect the color of salt ponds. History Leslie Salt ponds, 1972 At the time of the Gold Rush, salt was an important part of food preservation and was used in many industries. The favorable conditions and the immediate need sparked the explosion in salt production. At the time, the marshlands were seen as unproductive land that could be developed for better uses. Eventually this led to 80% of the original marshes developed for other uses. Over time, many of the smaller producers sold their land and producing rights to the Oliver Salt Company, which would eventually replace the Leslie Salt Company in Newark. In 1972, Cargill purchased Leslie to become the dominant landholder and holder of salt production rights in the area. In 2003, Cargill sold the bulk of its salt ponds to the California Coastal Conservancy, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and private foundations with the goal of restoring the ponds to wetlands. This effort is known as the \\"South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project\\". Not all the salt ponds are being restored. Cargill has proposed development of the ponds into housing in Redwood City. South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project Eden Landing Ecological Reserve San Francisco Bay Area The project is being headed by the state of California and the federal government to restore of Cargill's former salt ponds in San Francisco Bay. In October 2000, Cargill proposed to consolidate its operations and sell lands and salt production rights on 61% of its South Bay Operation area. Negotiations were headed by Senator Dianne Feinstein and a framework agreement was signed in May 2002 by the conservancy, the California Resources Agency, the Wildlife Conservation Board, the California Department of Fish and Game, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Cargill and Senator Feinstein. California approved purchase of the property on February 11, 2003. The land is currently managed and owned by the US Fish and Wildlife Services and the Department of Fish and Game. The goal of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project is to restore 90% of the former salt ponds to natural wetlands. The Native Plant Nursery at Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is providing plants to the restoration project. The SBSPRP, with over 15,000 acres and a 50-year plan, is the largest wetlands restoration project on the West Coast and provides the benefits of wetland restoration, including flood control, pollution reduction, habitat expansion for wildlife, and public access and recreation for people. The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project is integrating restoration with flood management, while also providing for public access and wildlife-oriented recreation and education opportunities. Restored tidal marshes will provide critical habitat for the endangered California clapper rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. Large marsh areas will also provide extensive channel systems which will provide habitat for aquatic life and harbor seals. Flood management will also be integrated to protect local communities. Restoration will also offer many opportunities for public use, including trails for hiking and biking, hunting, bird watching, environmental education and other recreational opportunities. Eden Landing Ecological Reserve is part of the area being restored. The Hewlett Foundation has funded restoration of the Bay Area Salt Ponds.

History On its website, World Affairs traces its history to the 1947 UN Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, where the United Nations was founded. However, its deeper history traces back to the San Francisco Bay Region Division of the American Institute of Pacific Relations, a division of the Institute of Pacific Relations organization founded in 1925 for the purpose of furthering the mutual interests of Pacific rim nations and their citizens.Paul F. Hooper, ed., Remembering the Institute of Pacific Relations: The Memoirs of William L. Holland (Tokyo: Ryukei Shyosha, 1995), pp. 77-120; Funding came largely from private businesses and philanthropies, especially the Rockefeller Foundation. The parent organization was in turn part of a larger network of groups with locations in Australia, Canada, France, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the USSR. Officers during the 1944-1947 period included Ray Lyman Wilbur as Chair, Lynn White, Jr. as Executive Vice Chair, Mrs. Alfred McLaughlin and Robert G. Sproul as Vice Chairs, and Ernest B. Price and Eugene Staley as Executive Directors. The San Francisco Bay Region IPR assisted the American IPR division conducted many activities similar to World Affairs today, conducting research in local and national issues (with a special focus on the Pacific Rim area) and carrying out meetings, conferences, and seminars for teachers In 1946, it had 400 members and was producing several regular publications. The San Francisco Bay Region IPR was formally dissolved in June 1947 when it united with other groups to form the World Affairs Council of Northern California, a member chapter of the World Affairs Councils of America. Its headquarters on Sutter Street, part of the Union Square district of San Francisco, were built in 1909, and feature a total of 51,150 square feet. Programs and events World Affairs organizes a number of events geared toward providing educational opportunities focused on international affairs. It notably hosts regular lecture/interviews open to members and the public and featuring speakers that are experts in their fields of endeavor such as ambassadors, foreign dignitaries, corporate leaders and higher education professors with expertise in current national and international issues.

He was a member of the Elphinstone of Schank family. Schank was in Arniston in Midlothian. Master Nicolas or Nicoll Elphinstone worked for James Stewart, Regent Moray and was involved in attempts to sell the jewels and pearls of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1567 and 1568.Karen Raber, 'Chains of Pearls: Gender, Property, Identity', in Bella Mirabella ed, Ornamentalism: The Art of Renaissance Accessories (University of Michigan, 2011), pp. 159-180.

Mary Queen of Scots, with ropes of pearl, and pearls embroidered on her bonnet  Elphinstone in London  Nicoll Elphinstone, trained in law, was an important servant of James Stewart, Earl of Moray, a half-brother of Mary, Queen of Scots. Moray sent him to Queen Elizabeth's court in the summer of 1565. John Knox said that he went to England in July 1565 to raise ¬£10,000 for Mary's political opponents, at the time of her marriage to Lord Darnley, finance for the rebellion known as the Chaseabout Raid.David Laing, History of the Reformation by John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1848), p. 496. On 2 August 1565 Moray wrote to the Earl of Bedford, Governor of Berwick, that he had sent a boat armed with cannon to Lindisfarne to pick up Elphinstone. He hoped Bedford could ensure Elphinstone's safe passage on land from Newcastle.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 188-9.

The Earl of Moray was in London. He sent Nicholas Elphinstone to her in July 1567, but the Lords would not allow him to see the queen. The Confederate Lords considered sending Elphinstone to France to declare their actions to Charles IX.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 354, 356, 371. Moray arrived in Scotland and was made Regent of Scotland on 22 August 1567. He now had control of royal property including a chest of jewels in Edinburgh Castle.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 386. On 20 October 1567 Moray sent Elphinstone to Berwick-upon-Tweed and London with a consignment of the queen‚Äôs jewels. These pieces were intended for sale and not to be pledged for loans. They were given an estimated value of 9,000 French crowns. The consignment included:Historical Manuscripts Commission 6th Report: Earl of Moray (London, 1877), p. 643. * A chain of 91 little rings with two sparks of rubies (except two missing), with 12 square \\"intermiddis\\" (entredeux) set with table diamonds, and one round entredeux with a ruby, and two rock rubies. Estimate 3,000 French crowns. * Four great table rubies in a gold garnishing (head-dress). Estimate 3,000 French crowns. * Four great table diamonds set in the same fashion. Estimate 3,000 French crowns. =Pearls and Queen Elizabeth= Elizabeth of Bohemia, wearing the \\"Medici pearls\\" Elphinstone sold a large group of pearls to Elizabeth at the end of April 1568. These pearls have come to be known as the \\"Medici pearls\\". Pope Clement VII is said to given them to Catherine de' Medici as a wedding gift. Brant√¥me wrote that she gave them to Mary and he saw her wearing them.P. Brant√¥me, M√©moires de Messire Pierre du Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant√¥me, contenans les vies des dames illustres de France de son temps (Paris 1665), p. 39 Brant√¥me does not say the pearls were a gift to Catherine from the Pope. Catherine made efforts to buy them back in London.Joseph Robertson, Inventaires de la Royne Descosse (Edinburgh, 1863), pp. 10-11: Teulet, Relations, vol. 2, pp. 352, 367-8: G.

The pearls are said to have been given in 1613 to Princess Elizabeth at her marriage, and some are thought to have returned to the British royal family. King James bought pearls and gave them to Princess Elizabeth pearls before her marriage.Nadine Akkerman, Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia: 1603-1631, vol. 1 (Oxford, 2015), pp. 73-4. Anne of Denmark, in 1619, had a \\"carcanet\\" of long and round pearls worth ¬£40,000 and said to be the \\"fairest that are to be found in Christendom.\\"Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 251. The attempted sales in London in 1568 are known from the letters of a French diplomat, Bochetel de Forrest. Bochetel described the great pearls in detail. There were six cordons sashes strung like paternosters, each with twenty five pearls, many large and beautiful, the most part as big as muscady nuts, nutmegs. They were valued by several merchants for Elizabeth. English merchants offered 10,000 crowns, Italians 12,000, a merchant from Geneva suggested 16,000. Elizabeth, it was thought, paid 12,000. The rest of the jewels on offer were not so valuable, except a well mounted piece of unicorn horn.Labanoff, Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol. 7, pp. 132-3. Bochetel's French words for nutmeg \\"noix muscades\\" seem to be the origin of an idea that Mary's pearls were black, by confusion with the word \\"noir\\". Bochetel de Forrest described how Elpinstone had met the Scottish double-agent Ninian Cockburn, alias \\"Beaumont\\", on his journey at Berwick. Nicholas Throckmorton arranged his audience with Elizabeth, and Elphinstone showed her the jewels and pearls in the presence of the Earls of Pembroke and Leicester.Alexandre Labanoff, Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol. 7 (London, 1852), pp. 129-130, the place-name is printed \\"Varvich\\". Bochetel wrote that the jewels were carried secretly to London and the pearls sold to Elizabeth for twelve thousand crowns: \\"ces bagues ... ont este icy envoyees fort secretement, et en fin, comme jay cy devant escript, acheptees par ceste royne pour le somme de douze mil escus.\\"Biblioth√®que nationale de France BNF Fran√ßais 15971, f.109 The concluded sale was not kept secret: when Elphinstone came to Carlisle in June 1568, Mary asked for his arrest as \\"hyr grevous enemye and seller of hyr juells\\".Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2, p. 422. William Kirkcaldy of Grange noted the sale in his memorandum on the Edinburgh Castle jewel coffer: \\"Item Mr Nycoll Elphingston sauld the pearll in London for xiij m or xiiij m quhilk the Queen of England hes for hir self & causit by them.\\"National Records of Scotland E35/9/3, Grange‚Äôs memorandum of jewels in Edinburgh Castle. The jewel sales were halted by Mary‚Äôs escape from Lochleven and arrival in England on 16 May 1568. Elizabeth now had to appear impartial to causes in Scotland. She bought no more jewels directly from Moray‚Äôs agents and made efforts to prevent other sales of Mary‚Äôs goods in England.Calendar State Papers Foreign: Elizabeth, vol. 8, nos 2577, 2585. Elphinstone sent a letter to William Cecil when he got back to Edinburgh on 21 May 1568, carried by a man who had been at the battle of Langside and would describe the battle to Cecil.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2, p. 411. =Messenger for Regent Moray= Elphinstone continued to take messages to Elizabeth and Cecil for Regent Moray. Moray gave him a length of black velvet for his clothes and 120 French gold crowns to go London in January 1570.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1970), pp. 184-5. His instructions were to discuss offers to William Drury, the Marshal of Berwick, for him to lead an army in Scotland against Mary's supporters, issues following the Rising of the North, and Moray's actions against his rebels. Elphinstone was to press for at least ¬£1,000 and ¬£1,000 yearly to protect Protestant Scotland.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 53-5.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The building was commissioned to replace an aging mid-19th century vestry hall on St Matthews Row, which had been used by the Parish of St Matthew. The vestry hall had become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900. After the vestry hall had become inadequate for the council's needs, civic leaders decided to procure a new town hall. The site selected for the new building had previously been occupied by residential properties known as 2-16 Patriot Square. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 23 Septembers 1909. The new building was designed by Percy Robinson and William Alban Jones in the Baroque style and built by Brand, Pettit and Co. It was officially opened on 1 November 1910. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto Cambridge Heath Road; the central bay featured a doorway on the ground floor, a large arched recess on the first floor and a domed tower above. A large sculpture depicting Charity, designed by Henry Poole, was installed above the main doorway. The building extended back for nine bays along Patriot Square, with a smaller sculpture depicting Justice, also designed by Poole, installed in the middle of that elevation. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber on the first floor containing statues depicting Truth and Happiness, again designed by Poole. The building was substantially extended to the east further along Patriot Square, to the designs of E.C.P. Monson in the Neo-classical style, with the works being completed in October 1939. The extension, which added an extra 21 bays to the Patriot Square elevation, featured a three-bay central section with a sculpture depicting the Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green above the doorway, three windows on each of the first and second floors and a pediment above. Internally, the principal rooms were the new council chamber, which was richly panelled with Australian walnut, and the mayor's room, both on the first floor. Consideration was given to incorporating a public hall into the design for the extension but council leaders decided to adapt York Hall, which had originally been planned as public baths, to accommodate a wider variety of uses instead. The building continued to function as the local seat of government for the enlarged London Borough of Tower Hamlets when it was formed in 1965. After the council moved to more modern facilities at Mulberry Place in 1993, the building lay vacant although the panelled council chamber was used as a location for several films including Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, released in 1998, and Atonement, released in 2007. In 2007 the building was sold to the hotelier, Loh Lik Peng, who converted it into a series of apartments and a 98-bedroom hotel, to a design by the architectural firm, Rare Architecture, preserving much of the Art Deco interior and covering much of the rear of the building with an unusual laser cut aluminium skin. After the hotel was officially opened in November 2010, the scheme received the \\"project of the year\\" award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2011.

History =Origins= The house was designed for industrialist and politician Andrew Jameson, great- grandson of John Jameson, by Manchester-based architect Alfred Darbyshire, who had previously worked on some of the Jameson distilleries. Located in the townland of Sutton South, it was constructed around the year 1880 on lands spanning the Bailey area of Howth and neighbouring Sutton. The 40-room house replaced an earlier nearby Sutton House which was demolished and had previously been occupied by Joseph Devonsher Jackson and later by Alice Lawrenson and Rev William Lawrenson, prebendary of Howth. Prior to the construction of the earlier Sutton House the land was owned by the Hackett Family and a substantial 16th century castle house stood on its grounds roughly near the location of the current castle gates. =Hotel= The house was converted into a 19-bedroom hotel in the 1970s called Sutton House Hotel and later Sutton Castle Hotel. It was sold, along with 7 acres of gardens and woodland, for IR¬£2.55m in 1997. Having continued to operate as a hotel, and then having operated as a temporary centre for asylum seekers for a number of years, the hotel was converted into 17 luxury apartments by the McKeown Group in 2001.  Notable residents  * The politician Andrew Jameson and later his daughter Harriet Kirkwood * The Flemish businessman Albert Luykx Status and features The house is recorded in the Fingal County Council Record of Protected Structures (RPS 0578) with the description Late 19th century four- storey Victorian Tudor-style house & gates, extended and converted into apartment complex. The main house, situated on terraces, has four storeys, and overlooks Dublin Bay. It has a Gothic porch, terracotta tiling, and art deco style chimneys, and the original bay and window structure is retained. A modern one- and two-storey extension to the west was added around 1990. The lobby and some of the original reception rooms remain, the latter now incorporated into some of the modern apartments. The main stairway was retained and restored, and a lift added prior to sale as apartments. Eight apartments were formed in the main house, and nine in the western extension. The house was damaged by fire in 1925 while newly wed Jameson and Ruth Hart were on honeymoon in New York but was later restored to its original condition. Popular culture The hotel and grounds were used as the background for the cover of the Van Morrisson album Veedon Fleece, in a photograph which was taken while he was staying at the hotel in 1974. Bono and Ali Hewson had their wedding reception at the hotel in 1982.

Built by the Earl of Leicester and completed in 1635, it was later occupied by Elizabeth Stuart, a former Queen of Bohemia, and by the Hanoverian Princes of Wales. From 1775 to 1788, the Leverian collection was on display in Leicester House. The house was sold and demolished in 1791. History Leicester House & Fields Leicester House was named for Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, who bought four acres of land in this part of Westminster, St Martin's Field, intending to build a new town house there. The area was not then built up, and the only nearby buildings were the armoury of the Military Company in Westminster to the north and the new town house of Sir William Howard, called Newport House, to the east. Sheppard (1966), pp. 441‚Äì472Gerrard Street Area: The Military Ground, Introduction, at british-history.ac.uk (British History Online), accessed 19 May 2020 In August 1631, King Charles I ordered his Attorney General, Sir Robert Heath, to prepare a licence for Leicester to build a house \\"with necessary outhouses buildinges and gardens\\", but this stipulated that the outer walls must be wholly of brick or stone and added also \\"the forefronts to bee made in that uniforme sort and order as may best bewtifie the place\\". The house was completed about 1635, according to Lord Leicester at a total cost of ¬£8,000, . A map of 1658 by Richard Newcourt and William Faithorne shows it as an asymmetrical group of buildings around a courtyard, with a huge gatehouse taking up most of the southern range. This is very different from the house pictured in 1727 by Sutton Nicholls, and nothing is known which records a rebuilding. However, what is shown on the map of 1658 may simply be intended as a cartographic symbol for a great house. To build the house and its outbuildings, Lord Leicester had had to enclose some of his four acres, all of which was common land in the parish of St Martin in the Fields. The commoners appealed to the king, and he appointed three members of the Privy Council to arbitrate. They ordered that the part of the land still unenclosed be kept open, and this became known as Leicester Fields. From April to August 1640, the new house was occupied by Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, soon after his return from meetings in Dublin as Lord Deputy of Ireland. Development in and around London and Westminster continued during the 17th century, and the size and importance of Lord Leicester's house encouraged the building of other smart town houses nearby.Laura Reynolds, 11 Secrets of Leicester Square at londonist.com, accessed 14 May 2020 Elizabeth Stuart, who died in the house For a short time in 1662, Leicester House was occupied by Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, the eldest daughter of James VI and I and the mother of Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the Electress Sophia of Hanover; Elizabeth Stuart died in the house on 13 February 1662, Thomas Allen later noting that she \\"ended her unfortunate life\\" there.: \\"The house was founded by one of the Sydneys, earls of Leicester, after the removal of that family from Sydney house, in the Old Bailey. This house was for a short time the residence of Elizabeth, daughter of James I, the titular queen of Bohemia, who, on the 13th of February, 1661, here ended her unfortunate life.\\" [NB, that date is 1661 Old Style.] In 1672, Lady Sunderland, the wife of Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, Lord Leicester's grandson, gave a dinner at the house attended by John Evelyn, who recalled that afterwards a fire-eater called Richardson entertained the company and \\"before us devour'd Brimston on glowing coales, chewing and swallowing them downe.\\" In 1674, Ralph, Lord Montagu, Master of the Great Wardrobe and later first Duke of Montagu, took a lease on Leicester House, after marrying Lady Northumberland, the widow of Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland, a nephew of Lady Leicester. In 1676 Montagu was sent as English ambassador to Paris and ended his occupation. In 1677 the elderly Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester died and was succeeded by his son Philip, 3rd Earl, who sold a large area of the garden for building Leicester Street, Lisle Street, and part of what is now Leicester Square. He also built a tavern in front of the courtyard and died in the house in 1698. Frederick, Prince of Wales Augusta, Princess of Wales About November 1742, Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of George II, moved into the house, after agreeing to lease it. In July 1743 Jocelyn Sidney, 7th Earl of Leicester, died without a successor, and the house was inherited by two sisters, Lady Sherard and Elizabeth Perry. On 16 August 1743, they granted a fourteen-year lease to the prince, running from Michaelmas of 1742, and in 1744 Elizabeth Perry paid her sister ¬£4,000 for her half-share. The successive Princes of Wales were natural alternative centres of political opposition, and the term \\"Leicester House faction\\" was used to describe the public men who were swayed by the Princes of Wales holding court there. On Frederick's death in 1751, the lease was inherited by his son the future George III, who was a minor, and for some twenty years his widow Augusta, Princess of Wales, continued the tradition of an alternative court at Leicester House.The Leicester House faction at historyofparliamentonline.org, accessed 14 May 2020 A view showing the house, c. 1750 In 1774, Sir Ashton Lever took a lease on the house, converting the rooms on the first floor into a single large gallery running the length of the house, and in February 1775 opened a museum to display his Leverian collection. It had around 25,000 exhibits, said to be a small fraction of Lever's collections, and remained at Leicester House until 1788.Abstract of a Petition of Sir Ashton Lever for a Bill to enable him to dispose of his museum] at bopcris.ac.uk, 29 September 2007, archived Thanks to his mounting debts, George, Prince of Wales, the future George IV, sold the freehold of the house. After it was demolished in 1791, the house and its gardens were redeveloped as numbers 7‚Äì15, Leicester Square (on its north side), and some new houses on Leicester Place, Leicester Street, Lisle Street, and Sidney Street (now Sidney Place). Chinatown After the redevelopment, the area lost prestige and became an entertainment and shopping district. When the main house was pulled down, some of its stables became part of a new property on Lisle Street built between 1792 and 1795, later known as the White Bear Yard livery stables. These survived until demolished in 1906.

It hosts, amongst other European Commission departments, the Euratom Supply Agency. History In the early 1990s, following the codification of Luxembourg as joint seat of the European Commission with Brussels at the 1992 Edinburgh European Council, and due to staff increases created by the enlargements of the European Union (EU) and increased responsibilities of the institution, the European Commission began looking for additional premises in Luxembourg City. Since 1975, the European Commission's Luxembourg activities had been primarily based in the Jean Monnet building in the Luxembourg City quarter of Kirchberg, in the northeast of Luxembourg City. This location had been promoted by the Luxembourg government as a base for European institutions since the 1960s. Whilst the European Commission aimed to rent office space in the Kirchberg District Centre, a mixed-use development under construction in northeastern Kirchberg, this would not be ready until 1998, and was not projected to meet all its office space requirements. Additionally, the European Commission faced competition for land from other European institutions based in Kirchberg. Therefore, the European Commission decided to settle on the rental of additional property in the south of the City, in what was then the relatively undeveloped quarter of Gasperich. Construction on the Euroforum building, designed by architectural firm Novotny M√§hner & Associates, was completed in 1996, with the European Commission signing an agreement for the rental of office space within the building on 1 July 1995. Until 2004 other parts of the building were occupied by the \\"Inn-Side Hotel\\", after which, they were converted for use as additional office space by the European Commission, which, in March 2003, had signed a long term lease contract with the owner, Euroforum SA. This included an option of purchasing. The Euroforum building cemented Gasperich as the second \\"pole\\" ‚Äî after Kirchberg ‚Äî of the European Commission's activities in Luxembourg City, with the institution acquiring additional office space in the quarter, such as the Ariane and Drosbach buildings, since. However, following the completion of the Jean Monnet 2 building in Kirchberg, expected in 2024, the European Commission's Office of Infrastructure and Logistics expects to vacate all its current premises in Gasperich with the exception of the Euroforum building. Hosted departments The Euroforum building has historically been used to host European Commission departments requiring a \\"very high protection level\\", including the Euratom Supply Agency ‚Äî which ensures the regular and equitable supply of nuclear fuels to EU users. Other departments hosted within the building include the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT); the Directorate-General for Energy (DG ENER); the Directorate-General for Human Resources and Security (DG HR); and the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE). Specifications The Euroforum building has a total area of 30,285 m¬≤ and a net floor area of 23,389 m¬≤, with 5 above ground storeys and an estimated height of 17.59 m. It provides for 434 offices.

Biography  Rebeca Cherep was born in Avellaneda, which is a suburb of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She completed her undergraduate studies at the National University of La Plata, earned her PhD in mathematics, and taught at the Faculties of Exact and Natural Sciences and Engineering at the University of Buenos Aires. She married Jos√© Guber, an engineer, and they had at least one child, Rosana Guber. In 1960 she was part of the group of scientists and teachers who created the Argentine Calculation Society, under the direction of Manuel Sadosky, with whom, years before, she had written the textbook, Elements of Differential and Integral Calculus. In the years since its first publication, the text has been widely disseminated among advanced students of science and engineering, and republished many times. = Calculation Institute = The Calculation Institute (IC) of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences was created around 1959. Rebeca Guber took over as Technical Secretary on June 6, 1960. A few months later, the computer named Clementina, (which was installed in 18 metal cabinets stretching long) became known as the first computer installed for scientific research in Argentina and began its operations at the IC. About her work there, Guber has recalled: > \\"After 1955, Manuel [Sadosky] became a professor of the Analysis I course > and I was his head of practical work. When the Calculation Institute was > created, Manuel called me to be his chief of operations. It was a very busy > and rewarding time. Manuel outlined the policies and I made sure that > everything went as planned. He had to handle a group of seventy people.\\" Guber's work proved to be fundamental in the entire process of installation and development of the famous Clementina. Rebeca Guber, along with her colleague and friend Cecilia Berdichevsky, are only two of the female mathematicians who were fundamental to the success of the early development of information science in Argentina. = University closure = In 1966, with Argentina's coup d'etat that removed the president from power and culminated in the Night of the Long Batons, scientists and researchers massively resigned from institutes and universities. The Calculation Institute of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences was \\"practically dismantled.\\" After Rebeca Guber, Juan √Ångel Chamero and David Jacovkis resigned their positions there and under the leadership of Manuel Sadosky, they founded a consultancy firm called Scientific Technical Advisors (ACT), in part to prevent the Institute's lines of research and work from being totally abandoned. = Secretariat of Science and Technology = After the return of Argentinian democracy and the election of president Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n at the end of 1983, Guber continued to work with Sadosky when he was named the Nation's Secretariat of Science and Technology. = Legacy = In tribute to her, in the Calculus Institute there is a room that bears her name: Rebeca Cherep de Guber Classroom.

He served in the War of American Independence.  Biography  B√©lizal was born to an aristocratic family. He was the grandson of La Jaille, and brother to Charles de Kermorvant de Gouzillon, and to Jean-Michel-Guillaume de Gouzillon, who both also served in the Navy. B√©lizal joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine on 12 December 1755. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 24 March 1772. B√©lizal took part in the Seven Years' War, were he was wounded twice. In 1777, B√©lizal commanded the 10-gun Curieuse in the Squadron of Brest, under Du Chaffault. In June 1778, B√©lizal captained the 32-gun frigate Licorne, part of a division under La Clocheterie, and also comprising the frigate Belle Poule, the corvette Hirondelle and the lugger Coureur. The division threatened by a British squadron, the division separated. While Belle Poule escaped after fighting the Action of 17 June 1778, Licorne found herself surrounded by three ships of the line, and struck her colours after B√©lizal fired both his broadsides in a token gesture of defence. B√©lizal was taken prisoner to Alverstoke. B√©lizal was imprisoned for 19 months, during which he refused to consider himself a prisoner of war, as war had not been declared when the British had captured his ship. B√©lizal was promoted to Captain on 9 May 1781. He was given command of the frigate V√©nus, capturing the British privateer Lord Amherst on 16 June. V√©nus was wrecked near Gl√©nan Islands on 5 August 1781. From 10 June 1782, he served on the 110-gun Bretagne, and from 1786 he captained the 32-gun frigate C√©r√®s. On 2 November 1786, he was promoted to Chef de Division and given command of the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Navy. From August 1790 to 1791, he captained the 74-gun Jupiter.

R.\\" Kaufman (February 11, 1885 ‚Äì February 1, 1979) was a Canadian industrialist, philanthropist, birth control advocate and eugenicist from in Kitchener, Ontario. In 1920 he became president of the Kaufman Rubber Company following the death of his father, Jacob Kaufman, with whom he founded the company in 1908. He held the position until 1964 with his time in the role marked by a strong and persistent opposition to organized labour. An active member of the municipal activities in Kitchener, he chaired the city's planning commission and was a significant supporter the local YMCA and YWCA. Kaufman was also a member of the University of Waterloo's first Board of Governors. Beyond his civic engagements, Kaufman was a member of the Eugenics Society of Canada and a vocal advocate of birth control for address social and economic hardship. He founded the Parents' Information Bureau in the early 1930s to distribute information about birth control and provide access to sterilization services. In 1936 one of the Bureau's employees, Dorothea Palmer, was arrested and charged under section 207 of the Criminal Code, which outlawed the selling or advertising of contraceptives. Her legals fees covered by Kaufman, Palmer was acquitted on the basis that her actions had passed the criminal code's pro bono publico clause. Biography Kaufman was born February 11, 1885, in Berlin, Ontario to industrialist Jacob Kaufman and Mary Ratz. Kaufman, like his parents, was a life-long member of the Zion United Church. His mother served as the first president of the Berlin YWCA, which was founded at the church in 1905. Kaufman began working with his father in 1903, as an employee at the Merchant's Rubber Company. Prior to the sale of he company, he served as an apprentice and as an office administrator, after which time he spent time travelling in the United States and Europe to see other rubber factory operations in person. Kaufman and Jean Hutton, a secretary at the Kaufman Rubber Company, were married in 1911 and together they had four children, one of whom died in infancy. =Kaufman Rubber Company= Kaufman founded the Kaufman Rubber Company with his father, Jacob Kaufman, in 1908. His father as president until his death in 1920, at which time A. R. stepped into the role. Kaufman served as president of the company until 1964 when he became chairman of the board. He was replaced as head of the company by his son William Kaufman. As head of the family company, Kaufman repeatedly prevented the unionization of his employees and acted punitively in response to efforts to organize. Historians John English and Kenneth McLaughlin framed his approach to management as \\"paternalistic,\\" noting that the Kaufman Rubber Company was the only factory in the rubber industry to remain unorganized, long after others had unionized. In the fall of 1937 Kaufman Rubber Company workers went on strike after he refused to accept employment terms similar to those reached by competing local rubber companies Goodyear and B.F. Gooderich. Believing a privately owned company would be in a weaker bargaining position, the employees pushed forward more extensive demands that Kaufman refused to discuss or take seriously for the majority of the strike. A compromise was eventually struck by the Department of Labour, in which Kaufman agreed not to discriminate against strike organizers and to submit disputes for mediation. The agreement dissolved when Kaufman explained that he had only agreed to the terms until December 1, after which time labour historians Judy Fudge and Eric Tucker quote him as saying there would be \\"plenty of discrimination.\\" Amid Kaufman's continued threats to close the factory for the winter, the workers ultimately gained nothing with wages and work conditions remaining in line with those in place prior to the strike. Birth control and eugenics Kaufman is recognized for playing a key role the birth control movement in Canada. He became interested in birth control in 1929 at the beginning of the Great Depression. Although company operations had previously relied on seasonal labour, increased layoffs during the Depression yielded complaints that it was employees who most needed the work that were being impacted. Visits to family homes by a company nurse who confirmed that it was those with the most children and the poorest living conditions struggling compared to the people who remained employed. Anne Weber, the nurse tasked with visiting the homes, found growing families and evidence of feeble- mindedness. Ruling out the financial feasibility of keeping seasonal employees on year-round, Kaufman determined the best way to assist was to provide family planning services. Initially extended to current and former employees, the family planning services funded by Kaufman were extended to anyone in the Kitchener area, eventually receiving requests from elsewhere in the province and across Canada. He founded the Parents' Information Bureau (PIB) to help meet increasing demand. The organization employed approximately 50 people in locations across the country who worked to distribute birth control and family planning information in women's homes rather than at clinics. Families visited by PIB representatives were able to make orders for supplies that were in turn mailed directly to their homes. Mailed kits included spermicides, condoms and information about purchasing additional items like diaphragms. As a member of the Eugenics Society of Canada, founded in 1930, Kaufman counted sterilization as a viable means of birth control. He thought that the poverty experienced by poorer classes of people could be remedied by alleviating the financial burden of having an excessive number of children. He further believed that the socially and mentally deficient were unable to reliably use alternative methods of birth control such as properly inserting a diaphragm, making sterilization the best way to prevent them from reproducing. In 1935, while pushing for a government department dedicated to birth control, Kaufman recommended sterilization for \\"patients in the dull normal class or worse\\" while addressing the American birth control league. Kaufman continued to support and advocate eugenics well after the widespread abandonment of eugenic social policies following World War II. The Parents' Information Bureau continued to operate until 1978 with Kaufman reportedly telling an associate:\\"We're now respectable ‚Äì as you can see on any drugstore counter.\\" Between 1930 and 1969 approximately 1,000 sterilization procedures were performed on Kaufman factory employees. In a review of the Canadian birth control movement, historian Dianne Dodd framed Kaufman's interest in birth control as financially and politically motivated, rather than one rooted in providing women reproductive control, as it provided an easy way to address the social unrest tied to poverty and unemployment while avoiding social or economic reform. =Eastview Birth Control Trial= In September 1936 Dorothea Palmer, an Ottawa-based employee of the Parents' Information Bureau was arrested and charged under section 207 of the Criminal Code, which stated that the selling or advertising of contraceptives was illegal. She was arrested for promoting contraception to women in the poor Roman Catholic Ottawa community of Eastview. At the time 1,000 of the 4,000 people living in the area were on social assistance, many with large families. Kaufman welcomed the chance to test Canada's laws in court. He spent the then considerable sum of $25,000 mounting a defence for Palmer in what would later be known as The Eastview Birth Control Trial, which lasted from 1936 to 1937. F. W. Wegenast, a fellow member of the Eugenics Society of Canada, was hired to defend Palmer in court. Kaufman testified during the trial disputing a claim his interest in birth control was commercially driven, explaining his actions were philanthropic in nature. He was also asked about the services provided to employees following visits from company nurse Anna Weber, swearing that some seasonal employees were provided with birth control while sterilizations had been arranged for others who requested the procedure. On March 17, 1937, Palmer was acquitted based on the conclusion that her actions passed the criminal code's pro bono publico clause and were carried out in the interest of the public good. The verdict was challenge in the Ontario Court of Appeal, but ultimately upheld. In comments following the trial, she explained her position as having had to do the \\"dirty work\\" on behalf of men involved with the birth control movement. Although contraception was not fully legalized in Canada until 1969, Palmer was the only person to be prosecuted for providing information about birth control. Philanthropy Kaufman was a generous benefactor of Kitchener's public works and services, including the donation of three parks ‚Äì Kaufman, Hillside and Huron. He and his wife donated the funds for an addition to the Emmanuel Evangelical Church, which was dedicated in their honour in 1938. Kaufman was a member of the city's Planning Commission for 36 years and continued his family's active support of the Y and its various activities. Kaufman was also served on the Kitchener Hospital Board and was a member of the first Board of Governors at the University of Waterloo. The A.R. Kaufman Charitable Foundation was founded in 1973 to manage donations. Following his death in 1979, remaining assets totalling close to one million dollars were distributed to various projects, including $665,000 put toward the construction of what would become the A.R. Kaufman Family YMCA. Death and legacy In 1963 Kaufman as named Citizen of the Year by the Kitchener- Waterloo Jaycees, recognized for his work in civic planning and planned parenthood. Kaufman was honoured along with Elizabeth Bagshaw, Lise Fortier, George C. and Barbara Cadbury, by Ortho Pharmaceutical Ltd. in 1973 for their roles in advancing family planning in Canada. Kaufman was again honoured in 1976 by Planned Parenthood of Ontario for his work in advancing access to birth control and family planning services. Kaufman is a member of the Waterloo Region Hall of Fame and in 1973 Kitchener's A R Kaufman Public School was named in his honour. Kaufman died in his sleep on February 1, 1979. He was interred at Woodland Cemetery in Kitchener.

This is wider than standard gauge of which is used by the vast majority of rail lines in Canada. The gauge is unique to the Greater Toronto Area and is currently used on the Toronto streetcar system and the Toronto subway (three heavy-rail lines), both operated by the Toronto Transit Commission. As well, the Halton County Radial Railway, a transport museum, uses the Toronto gauge so its rail line can accommodate its collection of Toronto streetcars and subway trains. Several now-defunct interurban rail systems (called radial railways in southern Ontario) also once used this gauge. This unique gauge has remained to this day because it is easier to adapt new rail vehicles to fit the gauge than to convert the entire system to standard gauge. An alternate name for Toronto gauge is TTC gauge, named after the Toronto Transit Commission, the only operator currently using the gauge; however, the gauge existed prior to the creation of the TTC in 1921. Streetcar usage A grand union at a streetcar intersection; Toronto has three grand unions, such as this one at Spadina Avenue and Queen Street West A flange rail, which is typical of Toronto streetcar lines. All TTC streetcar routes, both past and present, have used the Toronto gauge. The TTC had three predecessor companies that also used Toronto gauge, each with a network of streetcar lines within the City of Toronto. All the systems listed below used Toronto gauge: * Toronto Street Railway (1861‚Äì1891) * Toronto Railway Company (1891‚Äì1921) * Toronto Civic Railways (1911‚Äì1921) The Toronto Street Railway created the Toronto streetcar system opening its first horsecar line in 1861. It also created the broad Toronto gauge to allow horse-drawn wagons and carriages to use the inside of the rail for a smoother ride through muddy, unpaved streets. The gauge also had the effect of precluding the movement of standard-gauge freight cars along streetcar lines. When its franchise ended in 1891, the Toronto Railway Company took over the system and replaced horse- drawn streetcars with electric trams; it continued the use of Toronto gauge. Because the TRC refused to service neighbouring areas annexed by the City of Toronto, the City created the Toronto Civic Railways in 1911 to serve those areas. TCR lines, clustered in the west end, east end and mid-town, were not interconnected. To move streetcars between carhouses, the TCR used the tracks of the TRC, which is one reason the City chose Toronto gauge for the TCR. The other reason is that when the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the City wanted to merge the two systems. There were no permanent links between the tracks of the TCR and TRC; temporary track was laid at night when the TCR needed to transfer streetcars. When the TRC's franchise ended in 1921, the TTC acquired both the TRC and the TCR and amalgamated the two systems, permanently linking their tracks. =Explanations for the gauge= Toronto gauge was first used for the horsecar system opened by the Toronto Street Railway in 1861. Two explanations are offered for the width of the gauge: # The gauge would make it impossible for the steam railways to use city tracks, and # The track would support the wheels of non-rail carriages and wagons, allowing such vehicles to handle muddy conditions that made roads impassable. According to transit advocate Steve Munro, \\"TTC gauge is English carriage gauge\\". According to the TTC, advocating the first explanation, the City of Toronto feared that the street railway franchise operator would allow the operation of steam locomotives and freight trains through city streets, as was common practice in Hamilton, Ontario (until the 1950s) and in many US cities, such as New York City and Syracuse, New York. However, fear of freight trains invading the streets was from the era of about 1891 to 1921, over 30 years after the creation of Toronto gauge, making this fear an unlikely reason for Toronto gauge. During this era, railway entrepreneurs William Mackenzie and Donald Mann controlled the Canadian Northern Railway, the Toronto Railway Company plus several radial railway lines including the Toronto Suburban Railway. About 1912, the Toronto Suburban wanted to convert its system from Toronto gauge to standard gauge, but the City of Toronto obtained a court injunction blocking the re-gauging over fears of freight cars in the streets. The railway, however, prevailed and the system was converted to standard gauge in 1917. Also, horsecar tracks could be of very light construction, adequate for horse-drawn trams, but unsuitable for heavier vehicles. When the Metropolitan Street Railway converted its streetcar line in North Toronto from horse to electric operation, the faster heavier electric trams damaged the horsecar rails requiring the line to be shut down and the track rebuilt to a higher standard. Supporting the second explanation, the 1861 agreement between the City of Toronto and the Toronto Street Railway stated: As wagons were normally built at standard gauge, the streetcar rails were selected to be slightly wider, allowing the wagons to ride on the inside sections of the rail, and the streetcars on the outside. The Williams Omnibus Bus Line changed the gauge of their buses in 1861 to fit this gauge. At the time, track for horsecars was not our modern 'T' rail, but wide and flat, with a raised section on the outside of the rail. =Variations in Toronto gauge= Before TTC ownership, however, the streetcar gauge was either Old time trains Track gauge or , depending on the historical source, instead of today's . When the Toronto Street Railway opened its first horse-drawn streetcar line in 1861, it used a variation of Toronto gauge, a width of . When the Toronto Railway Company took over the streetcar system in 1891, its charter stipulated a gauge of When the TTC took over streetcar operation in 1921, it set the Toronto gauge at the present day's width. However, Ken Heard, Consultant Museologist, Canadian Museums Association, was reported to say: \\"One of the terms of these agreements was that the track gauge was to accommodate wagons. As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the rail. Wagon wheels naturally did not have a flange. They were made of wood, with an iron tire. Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed.\\" In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said \\"the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof\\". According to Raymond L. Kennedy said: \\"The street railways were built to the horse car gauge of 4 feet 10 and inches. (The TTC changed this to 4 and is still in use today even on the subway. )\\" James V. Salmon said the \\"city gauge\\" was 4 ft . Both these sources were describing a former streetcar junction at the intersection of Dundas and Keele Streets laid entirely to Toronto streetcar gauge until August 1912. The junction was used by both the Toronto Suburban Railway and the Toronto Railway Company. Subway usage =Heavy rail= All three heavy- rail subway lines in Toronto use Toronto gauge. They are: * Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity * Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth * Line 4 Sheppard Some early subway proposals involved using streetcars at least partially in tunnels, so using the same gauge would be advantageous, but the idea was ultimately dropped in favour of dedicated rapid transit trains. Nonetheless, the heavy-rail lines use the streetcar gauge today. According to rail historians John F. Bromley and Jack May, the reason that the Yonge subway line was built to the streetcar gauge (Toronto gauge) was that between 1954 and 1965, subway bogies were maintained at the Hillcrest Complex, where the streetcar gauge is used for shop tracks. The Davisville Carhouse was not equipped to perform such heavy maintenance, and the bogies would be loaded onto a specially built track trailer for shipment between Davisville and Hillcrest. This practice stopped with the opening of the shops at Greenwood Yard in 1965. Temporary streetcar/subway interchange to Davisville Yard (left) at Belt Line bridge Using Toronto gauge for the Yonge subway line had secondary benefits. A number of ex-streetcar vehicles were used as work trains for the subway, taking advantage of the common gauge. Before the opening of the Yonge subway in 1954, there was also a temporary interchange track between the Yonge streetcar line and the Davisville Yard on the north side of the Belt Line bridge. In 1953, subway cars 5000 and 5001, after being displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition, were mounted on shop bogies and towed at night by a Peter Witt motor to the Davisville Yard via the Yonge streetcar line using the temporary interchange. (They arrived at the CNE from the Hillcrest Complex via the Bathurst streetcar line. Because of the subway car width, buses had to replace night streetcar service during the movements. At the CNE, the subway cars were displayed on their proper subway bogies.) Subway lines 1, 2 and 4 all use Toronto gauge to allow the interchange of equipment between these lines. Initially, after the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line opened in 1966, trains from the Yonge‚ÄìUniversity line terminated at the termini of Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line as a trial for interlining. However, this trial ended six months later. The Sheppard subway has no carhouse, and thus, for servicing, its trains must transfer to line 1 to reach the Davisville Yard. =Standard-gauge lines= In addition to the heavy-rail lines, there are light-metro and light-rail lines that are considered to be part of the Toronto subway system, but use standard gauge: * Line 3 Scarborough is a light metro using Intermediate Capacity Transit System technology that is incompatible for running on heavy-rail lines, thus making customization for Toronto gauge of no benefit. However, when its ICTS vehicles need anything more than basic service (which can be carried out at the McCowan Yard), they must be carried by truck to the Greenwood Subway Yard. * Line 5 Eglinton and Line 6 Finch West are light-rail lines that are under construction. These projects are in large part funded by the Ontario provincial transit authority. The light-rail vehicles on these lines will not be customized to use Toronto gauge, both to ensure a better price for purchasing vehicles and MetroLinx wants to have a degree of commonality with other similar projects within Ontario. =Hamilton= In 2009, the City of Hamilton Public Works produced an analysis for a future light rail line in Hamilton. The analysis looked at whether the city should use standard gauge or \\"TTC gauge\\". The report said the benefit in using the Toronto gauge would be to save costs if Hamilton's order could be combined with Toronto's for light-rail vehicles, and to encourage their manufacture in the Greater Toronto Area. The benefit of standard gauge would be greater compatibility with other tram systems and the elimination of the costs to customize the bogies. This analysis occurred before Metrolinx took over the project and stipulated the use of standard gauge. Radial railways Radial railways were Interurban tram lines serving communities just beyond the then- city limits. These interurban lines were called \\"radials\\" in southern Ontario as they radiated from a city. By the early twentieth century, there were two radial systems operating from the City of Toronto: * Toronto and York Radial Railway * Toronto Suburban Railway Most of the radials within the above two systems used Toronto gauge at some time during their existence. The following sections give a highly abridged summary of each line, focusing mainly on the gauge used. Click on links for a more extensive history. =Toronto and York Radial Railway= By 1904, the T&YRR; had acquired the following independent radial railways: * Metropolitan Street Railway (Toronto): Metropolitan (later Lake Simcoe) line * Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company: Scarboro line * Toronto and Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company: Mimico (later Port Credit) line In 1922, the City of Toronto acquired the assets of the T&YRR;, and contracted with the Hydro-Electric Railways to operate the radial lines on behalf of the City. However, ridership declined and the City suffered operating losses. In 1927, the TTC took over all the above radial operations, converting standard gauge lines to Toronto gauge, and connecting the radial tracks to the streetcar system. The City had hoped for efficiencies by not duplicating carhouses and shops. Metropolitan Street Railway The Metropolitan line of the Metropolitan Street Railway opened in 1885 as a horsecar line that used Toronto gauge. Initially, it ran along Yonge Street from the Canadian Pacific Railway mid-town line to Eglinton Avenue. At that time, the area was outside of the City of Toronto. By 1891, the line was electrified. In 1895, the Province granted the Metropolitan the right to change its gauge, which it did to standard gauge allowing for freight car interchange with steam railways. By that time the Metropolitan had reached Richmond Hill. As a standard-gauge line, the Metropolitan was eventually extended to Sutton, along the way connecting to the standard-gauge Schomberg and Aurora Railway, a steam railway converted by the T&YRR; into an electric radial line. In 1927, the TTC took over operation of the Metropolitan line, renaming it as the Lake Simcoe line. At that time the Metropolitan line had extended from Glen Echo Road in Toronto to Sutton. The connecting Schomberg and Aurora Railway was closed. The TTC re-gauged the tracks of the Lake Simcoe line to Toronto gauge within a seven day period, and connected them to the Yonge streetcar line. It closed the Glen Echo carhouse and moved operations to Eglinton Carhouse along the Yonge streetcar line. After re-gauging, box motors serving the Lake Simcoe line carried less-than-carload freight to downtown Toronto. Some city streetcars were modified for radial use to handle crowds to Bond Lake, an amusement park adjacent to the line. In Aurora, the TTC constructed a section of four-rail, dual-gauge track in order to deliver freight cars from a steam railway interchange to a local factory. (Three-rail dual gauge was not possible with only a difference between the two gauges.) The TTC adapted an old radial car as a standard-gauge switcher. The was one of only two locations where the TTC had dual-gauge trackage; the other was at the Hillcrest Complex. In 1930, the Lake Simcoe line was closed. However, three months later the section from Glen Echo to Richmond Hill reopened as the North Yonge Railways. It was operated by the TTC until 1948, and was the TTC's last radial operation. Toronto and Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company The Toronto and Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company opened the Mimico radial line in 1892. It ran along Lake Shore Road and initially used Toronto gauge. By 1905, the line reached its full length from Humber Loop to Port Credit. After taking over the line in 1922, Hydro-Electric Railways converted it from Toronto to standard gauge. When the TTC subsequently took over the line in 1927, it converted the line back to Toronto gauge in one overnight operation. The TTC also closed the old T&YRR; carhouse near Grenadier Pond and moved operations to Roncesvalles Carhouse. In late 1928, the Mimico line became the Port Credit line when the portion east of Long Branch Loop was replaced by a streetcar line (today used by 501 Queen). The Port Credit line closed in 1935, replaced by buses. Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company The Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company opened the Scarboro radial line in 1893. It ran along Kingston Road and used Toronto gauge for its entire life. By 1906, the line reached its full length from Queen Street to West Hill. After Hydro-Electric Railways took over the line in 1922, the portion of the line west of Victoria Park Avenue was replaced by a TTC streetcar line, used today by the 503 Kingston Rd streetcar route. In 1927, the line was taken over by the TTC and connected to Bingham Loop, and the Scarboro line's Warden carhouse was closed with operations moved to Russell Carhouse. The line was closed in 1936. =Toronto Suburban Railway= The Toronto Suburban Railway operated several radial lines west of the old city limits, all radiating from the Junction at Dundas Street and Keele Street. Its first line, the Davenport line (serving Davenport Road), opened in 1892. Next came three other lines: Lambton (1892, serving the neighbourhood of Lambton), Crescent (1893, serving Gilmore Avenue) and Weston (1895, serving Weston Road) with an extension to Woodbridge called the Woodbridge line (1914). These were basically semi-rural, suburban streetcar lines. All were built to a track gauge of , a variant of Toronto gauge. By the completion of the Toronto Suburban's standard-gauge Guelph line in 1917, all the other Suburban lines were converted to standard gauge. The Toronto Street Railway had a wye in the intersection of Keele and Dundas streets to turn its single-ended streetcars coming from east of the intersection. Before its conversion to standard gauge, the Toronto Suburban shared a track of this wye to connect its routes east and north of the intersection. After the conversion to standard gauge, the wye was rebuilt with a curved, mixed-gauge crossing for Toronto Suburban cars. After its creation in 1921, the TTC took over all radial lines within the Toronto city limits. Thus, the TTC took over the Lambton and Weston lines and converted them back to TTC gauge.

The music hall historian Christopher Pulling called him one of the 'grand comedians of the music- halls'.Christopher Pulling, They Were Singing (And What They Sang About), (London: George G. Harrap, 1952), p. 52 He had a successful 62 year career and played in over 40 pantomimes. Early life The Six Brothers Luck in 1895 - Glenville standing second from right He was born as John Browne in Little Denmark Street, Dublin in Ireland where his mother Mary n√©e Lynch was the manager of the Mechanics' Theatre, a theatre and music hall that stood on the site later occupied by the Abbey Theatre. His father Henry Browne was an accountant. He took the stage name 'Glenville' from Glenville House in County Wicklow. His first stage appearance was aged two weeks at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham when he was carried on in Dion Boucicault's play Arrah-Na-Pogue. By 1895 as Shaun Glenville-Luck he had joined the music hall entertainers, burlesque and sketch artists The Six Brothers Luck. By 1906 he was appearing in Variety, and made his London d√©but at the Holborn Empire in 1907. In 1907 with The Six Brothers Luck he toured the United States in their 'farcical sketch' 'The Demon of the Cellar' and a number of other variety acts.The Six Brothers Luck - Footlight Notes website The critic of Variety wrote: > 'Shaun Glenville Luck makes a capital grotesque comedian and might, under > more kindly circumstances, be really funny, but the seltzer-bottle-bladder- > slapstick mess that makes up The Demon in the Cellar leaves him stranded. > The audience hopes for a minute that the introduction of acrobatics of some > sort might enliven the proceedings, but they hoped in vain.

Song writer Sheet music for 'If You're Irish Come Into The Parlour' by Glenville and Frank Miller (1919) Glenville wrote several songs with his and Ward's friend, Fred Godfrey. It is believed that Glenville also performed them but he recorded just two, both in 1915: 'Where Did You Get The Name Of Hennessy?' (Regal G-7607) and 'The Yiddisher Irish Baby' (Levi, Carney, Jacob, Barney, Michael Isaacstein) (Regal G-7221). Various extant sheet music covers and other sources show that Glenville performed at least five other Godfrey songs on stage: 'When An Irishman Goes Fighting' (1914); 'Tommy‚Äôs Learning French' (sung at a concert in France for the troops in June 1915 during World War I); 'Calling Me Home' (1922); 'My Little-Da-Monk' (1930); and 'It Takes An Irish Heart To Sing An Irish Song' (1932).Shaun Glenville (1884-1968) - the Songs of Fred Godfrey website Later years Glenville was a heavy drinker, and various stories are told of his mishaps while under the influence. These include occasional 'memory lapses' during performances including one occasion when as Dame Trott he forgot the words to a song he had sung numerous times on previous performances and had to be prompted by one of the actors in the cow costume. The actor Roy Hudd related an occasion when Binnie Hale as principal boy was appearing as Jack in panto with Glenville as Mrs. Hubbard in Jack and the Beanstalk at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1936: > 'One lunchtime Shaun arrived at the theatre twenty-five minutes late for the > matinee - he had over imbibed.

Reverend David Wadsworth Cannon was educated at Lincoln University and Princeton Theological Seminary, and was the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Cranford, New Jersey. He was also a chaplain during World War I, and as the result of a serious injury during the war, when he returned to New Jersey he could no longer preach. From that point on, Mrs. Cannon acted as the head of the family. Mrs. Cannon herself also held a degree, from the Evangel Theological Seminary, and worked as a teacher, social worker, lecturer, and activist for the Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union and for women‚Äôs suffrage. Wolfe remembered her parents wanting her to learn understanding and respect for herself, her heritage, and for other people, and the emphasis her parents placed on education‚Äôs role in changing people‚Äôs prejudices. Wolfe attended Cranford public schools, which was an integrated school system, but was nevertheless a place where she experienced racial prejudice. She participated in many extracurriculars at Cranford High School, including the National Honor Society, history club, tennis, and basketball, and she excelled academically.  Education Wolfe held three advanced degrees, a B.S from New Jersey City University, and an M.S. and a Ph.D from Columbia University. =New Jersey City University= Wolfe dreamed of attending Oberlin College due to its liberal reputation and its longstanding acceptance of women and African Amerians, but in 1929 the Great Depression began and the options for her pursuit of higher education became financially limited. She instead began commuting to New Jersey State Teachers College at New Jersey City University, which had a manageable tuition of one hundred dollars per year. She graduated in 1937 with her B.S. in Social Studies Education. While studying at New Jersey State Teachers College, Wolfe took on two internships and her teaching career thus began with teaching elementary age school children.Deborah Wolfe (1999) Interview: Teaching: A Lifetime Commitment, Kappa Delta Pi Record, 35:2, 86-88, DOI: 10.1080/00228958.1999.10518424. Wolfe worked many jobs to earn money for her commute to school, which she made by train, her tuition, and her books. She taught piano, tutored her fellow students, worked in the cafeteria, and did secretarial work for her professors. Wolfe worked one summer setting up educational and recreational programs for the children of migrant laborers in Maryland. She credits this experience as the inspiration for much of her later work in the field of Rural Education. She spent another summer as a Lisle Fellow for world peace. During the final two years of her undergraduate education, Wolfe was the principal of and a teacher at Cranford, New Jersey‚Äôs adult night school, where she organized classes, conducted teacher meetings, taught courses, and fulfilled administrative duties. She would later credit this experience with her formulation of her administrative philosophy, which she described as democratically shared leadership. She graduated in 1937. =Columbia University= After receiving her undergraduate degree, Wolfe attended Columbia University‚Äôs Teachers College. She received an M.S. in Rural Education there in 1938. While there, she learned under professors William Bagley and Florence Stratmeyer, both of whom were involved with the sorority Kappa Delta Pi, and they recommended her to membership, beginning her lifelong association with Kappa Delta Pi. She also studied under Professor Mabel Carney, and when she was finished with her Masters degree in 1938, Carney recommended Wolfe to Dr. Frederick Douglas, the then president of the Tuskegee Institute. Wolfe began working at the Tuskegee Institute the same year that she graduated with her Masters degree as a principal and teacher-trainer in the rural laboratory schools that were part of the Institute. Wolfe would later return to Columbia University‚Äôs Teachers College and graduate with her Ph.D. in 1945. Her doctoral dissertation was entitled A Plan for Redesigning the Curriculum of the Rural Laboratory Schools of the Tuskegee Institute. Career in education Wolfe served on the faculty of the Tuskegee Institute from 1938 to 1950. During that time, she was not only a principal, but the head of the Institute‚Äôs Department of Elementary Education and the Director of the Graduate Studies Program. In her role as Director of the Graduate Studies Program, Wolfe trained teachers to instruct other teachers in rural schools and to supervise schools, and she required them to complete a Master‚Äôs Thesis, a rigorous requirement compared to other, similar programs. While working at the Tuskegee Institute, Wolfe continued to pursue her education, and attended a summer session at Vassar College via scholarship in 1944. While there, Wolfe met First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt during a discussion group, and was inspired by the First Lady, whom she felt ‚Äúreally cared about all the people and made it abundantly clear that she was not prejudiced.‚Äù In 1950, Wolfe left the Tuskegee Institute and spent several years associated with numerous institutions and organizations. That year she worked at the University of Pennsylvania and studied research methods and statistical analysis, was appointed Professor of Education at Queens College, and began work as a Postdoctoral Scholar at Union Theological Seminary. She began lecturing at colleges and universities across the country as a visiting professor. Wolfe was the first African American professor at Queens College when she was appointed in 1950. She was tenured in 1954. While in that position, Wolfe also served as a chairperson for the admissions committee, coordinator of the campus laboratory school, and director of the African Study Abroad program. She stayed at Queens College until 1962 when she left to work as Education Chief of the Committee on Education and Labor in the United States House of Representatives. Notably, at the same time, Wolfe was pursuing religious studies; from 1952 to 1953 she continued the work she had began at Union Theological Seminary, this time at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. During her tenure as Education Chief, she worked under the Kennedy Administration Deborah Wolfe Obituary. (2004). Washington Post. to pass innovative and comprehensive education legislation. The work that she did in that position originated Head Start, financial aid, community colleges, and modernized vocational education. Her role was to coordinate all matters related to education coming before the committee, to educate members about the bills, and to liaise between the House of Representatives and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare on education issues. During this time, Wolfe helped pass into law the Economic Opportunity Act, also known as the War on Poverty, the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Wolfe stayed in her position as Education Chief until 1965. At that time, her son was graduating from high school in Cranford, New Jersey, and she felt that he needed her. She returned to New Jersey and resumed her work at Queens College, involving herself in many committees and school groups, including sponsoring the Kappa Delta Pi chapter there and participating in the International Honor Society in Education. Retirement and personal life By the time Wolfe retired from Queens College, she had been married twice; first in 1940 to Henry Roy Partridge, a specialist in agricultural and commercial dietetics whom she had met at the Tuskegee Institute, and then to Alvis Wolfe, a business executive, in 1959. Her marriage to Mr. Wolfe ended in 1966. In the early 1960s, Wolfe also played an active role in the civil rights movement, and had in fact advocated for the rights of African Americans throughout her career. In her retirement from her career as an educator, Wolfe was still very involved in a number of civil rights and advocacy groups, including a membership in the NAACP, her vice presidency of the National Council for Negro Women, and her position as the Grand-Basileus of the African American sorority Zeta Phi Beta. She participated in the famous march down Constitution Avenue, and was seated two rows behind Martin Luther King Jr. when he made his famous speech, ‚ÄúI Have a Dream.‚Äù In 1970, Wolfe was the first African American woman ordained by the American Baptist Church, and beginning in 1975, Wolfe served as the associate minister at the very same First Baptist Church of Cranford, New Jersey where her father had served before her. She remained involved with many organizations, and was the president of the National Alliance for Black School Educators, member of the Advanced Education Committee for the Graduate Record Examination, education area representative for the American Association of University Women, and was the first African American Woman fellow of the Commission on Science Education for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was the Vice President of the National Alliance for Safer Cities, an official non-governmental organization represented at the United Nations, and was the first person to serve on both the New Jersey State Board of Education and the New Jersey State Board of Higher Education simultaneously. She was the only African American member on the Seton Hall University Board of Regents, and served on the advisory board to the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College. While involved with Radcliffe College, she was on the Advisory Committee to the Black Women Oral History Project, and was interviewed herself as part of that project. Death and legacy Deborah Cannon Partridge Wolfe died on September 3, 2004.

Early life Martha Wilmot was born in 1775 in Glanmire, County Cork. Her parents were Edward and Martha Wilmot (n√©e Moore). She had five sisters and three brothers. Her father was from Derbyshire, England, having served as a captain of the 40th Regiment of Foot, and port surveyor of the revenue board in Cork and Drogheda. Wilmot was educated at home, and following the death of a brother in 1802, her cousin Catherine Hamilton urged her to visit her brother's friend, the Princess Dashkova of Russia. Time in Russia Wilmot began her four-month journey to Russia in 1803, travelling to the country estate of the princess, Troitskoe. While there, she took part in court life and became the princess' close confidante. While touring with the princess, Wilmot met Aleksei Orlov, and in her honour he ordered his regiment to stage a fake battle. She kept a diary and wrote letters home to Ireland frequently. She also encouraged the princess to write an autobiographical memoir, which Dashkova dedicated to Wilmot as her \\"young friend\\" and gave her permission to publish the manuscript. Wilmot's sister, Katherine, arrived in Troitskoe in 1805 to bring her sister home, but she stayed there as a guest for another two years. Between frequent trips to Moscow, Wilmot transcribed a copy of the princess' memoirs, with her sister translating them from the original French. Her sister left Russia in 1807 with the memoirs transcript when the Wilmots learnt they were under threat from Madame Shcherbenin, the estranged daughter of the princess, who was suspicious of their intentions. In 1808, Wilmot left Russia when hostilities broke out between England and Russia, despite objections from the princess who gave her a number of gifts including a watch owned by Peter the Great and a fan owned by Empress Catherine. While leaving St Petersburg, Wilmot was stopped and detained by customs officials who believed her to be in possession of secret documents. Fearing for her safety, she burnt the original manuscript of Dashkova's memoirs, and some of the princess' correspondence with Catherine II. On 26 October 1808, she sailed on the Maria, but this ship was wrecked leaving Wilmot to spend 8 days on the island of Stamieux, near Hamina, Finland. The passengers and crew then had to wait out a storm for three weeks on Aspo island. She reached Harwich, England on 26 December 1808, and Cork by 1809. Return from Russia Wilmot toured the southwest of Ireland the following summer, and was presented at the lord lieutenant's court in Dublin Castle in 1810. There she met the future Lady Morgan, Sydney Owenson. She moved to live with her parents in Clifton, Derbyshire in 1810. She married Rev. William Bradford in 1812. The couple had one son and two daughters, living at Sussex Downs, Storrington. She travelled to France with Katherine in 1817, and visited her at Moulins in 1818. When her husband was appointed chaplain to the British embassy in Vienna, the family moved there in 1819. Living there for there for the next 10 years, they were friends with Charles William, the British ambassador, and his wife. From 1820 to 1821, Wilmot and her family toured Italy, with her diaries of the period held in the Royal Irish Academy (RIA). The family returned to Storrington in 1929 when her husband was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to King George IV. In 1840, Wilmot's edition of Dashkova's memoirs were published in English, in two volumes, as Memoirs of the Princess Daschkaw, lady of honour to Catherine II, empress of all the Russias, written by herself: comprising letters of the empress, and other correspondence. Wilmot had delayed the publication due to strenuous opposition from Simon Vorontsov, Dashkova's brother. This volume was based on Wilmot's transcript and her sister's translation, and is an edited and condensed version of the original. It was later translated into French, German, Russian and Czech. Later life and death Wilmot returned to Ireland after the death of her husband in 1857, and lived with her daughter, Catherine, at Taney Hill house, Dublin. She died there on 18 December 1873, and is buried in Storrington churchyard in England. Wilmot and her sister's diaries were edited and published H. Montgomery Hyde and the Marchioness of Londonderry as The Russian journals of Martha and Catherine Wilmot in 1934, from the original letters, notes, and diaries held by the RIA. They also edited and published More letters from Martha Wilmot: impressions of Vienna, 1819‚Äì1829 in 1935. The RIA hold her papers, including some unpublished material. Wilmot's daughter donated the manuscript of the transcription of Dashkova's memoirs, including revisions from the princess, to the British Museum library. This manuscript was used for a new translation by Kyril Fitzlyon in 1958. Another copy of an earlier draft of the manuscript, in Wilmot's handwriting, is held in St Petersburg.

It was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Series in 2018. It consists of three novels and eight novellas, with six of the novellas included in the award. All three novels and two of the novellas were nominees for or winners of major awards. The World of the Five Gods was informally called \\"the Chalion series\\" at first, but the name was abandoned as the series expanded. Synopsis The World of the Five Gods series explores an alternate reality on a world analogous to Earth, influenced by conflicts between the old shamanic religion, the new dominant Quintarian religion, and the heretical Quadrene faith, mirroring the spread of Christianity in pagan lands and the later clashes between Catholicism and Islam. Quintarians acknowledge five gods ‚Äî Father, Mother, Daughter, Son, and Bastard ‚Äî while Quadrenes deny the Bastard, claiming he is a demon rather than a god. In the series, the various gods intercede in events but must do so by influencing people through dreams and visitations as they have no power to act directly on the world. Bujold has stated that she intends to write a novel that focuses on each god. The Hallowed Hunt features the Son, The Curse of Chalion the Daughter, and Paladin of Souls the Bastard. The Penric novellas predominantly focus on the Bastard. The first three Penric novellas were published in January of 2020 by Baen Books in a single volume, under the title Penric's Progress.Penric's Progress at Baen Books The works in the series share a world and theology, rather than related characters as in Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga. =Internal timeline= Bujold's reading-order guide states that the works in the World of the Five Gods can be read in any order, although Paladin of Souls has spoilers for The Curse of Chalion. Using the internal chronology of the stories, the events in the works take place in this order: #The Hallowed Hunt # \\"Penric's Demon\\", approximately 150 years after The Hallowed Hunt # \\"Penric and the Shaman\\" # \\"Penric's Fox\\" # \\"Masquerade in Lodi\\" (anticipated release late 2020 or early 2021) # \\"Penric's Mission\\" # \\"Mira's Last Dance\\" # \\"The Prisoner of Limnos\\" # \\"The Orphans of Raspay\\" # \\"The Physicians of Vilnoc\\" #The Curse of Chalion, approximately 100 years after the novellas #Paladin of Souls, a few years after The Curse of Chalion = Settings = The Curse of Chalion and Paladin of Souls are set in the landlocked medieval kingdom of Chalion, which is a fictional equivalent of Castile and Le√≥n during the time of the Reconquista, or Spanish Reconquest. Chalion and its neighboring countries are on the Ibran Peninsula, a reversed version of the Iberian Peninsula. The Hallowed Hunt, is set in the Weald, an area roughly similar to medieval Germany, southwest of the Ibran Peninsula. In the novellas, Penric begins in the Cantons, north of the Weald. His adventures take him to Adria, Orbas, and Cedonia, northwest of the Cantons and the Weald, as well as a disputed island off the coast of Adria.

It is also the location where he taught the Pandavas and Kauravas. In 1872, Singha Bharat, who was a ardent devotee of Shitala Devi (the wife of Drona), constructed the current temple. Singha Bharat had donated a lot of land towards Dronacharya-related structures. Over the years, the Drona temple became larger and went from one room to two rooms. The temple is currently maintained by five families that live near the temple. Often, visitors from the more famous Sheetla Mata Temple also visit the Dronacharya Temple. The temple is located near other important sites related to the Mahabharata in Gurugram, such as the Gurugram Bhima Kund (where Drona bathed), the Ekalavya temple, and a temple of Lord Shiva that was built by the Pandavas.  Structure  The temple has two rooms and is located on the corner of a street. It is painted pink. In the middle of the temple is a tall statue of Drona. Statues of other Hindu deities surround the Drona statue. The back wall has paintings that depict Dronacharya teaching his students.

Schwanitz and Israeli historian Barry Rubin. The authors argue that there is a high degree of similarity in the ideologies of Nazism, radical Arab nationalism, and Islamism. Content The authors start their analysis in the nineteenth century, when Germany, seeking colonial expansion, sought to displace British, French, and Russian influence in the Middle East, with little or no success. However Germany developed ties with radical Arab nationalist groups, which survived Germany's defeat in World War I. The rise of Nazism strengthened these connections, and interactions between Nazis and Islamists before and during World War II make up a significant part of the book. They continue by describing how the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, an influential Arab leader and Nazi collaborator, escaped prosecution after the war and tried to thwart Jewish attempts to establish the State of Israel, and the lives of ex-Nazis who found refuge in Arab states. The authors argue that there is a high degree of similarity in the ideologies of Nazism, radical Arab nationalism, and Islamism, an argument first made by the mufti. One of the most striking similarities, according to the authors, is that all three ideologies promote extreme antisemitism and blame Jews for all the problems in the world. The book analyzes the role of Nazi propaganda and the mufti, in spreading Nazi ideology and inciting antisemitism in the Middle East. The book also charts the development of the Middle East as it became modern, leading reviewer Johannes Houwink ten Cate to describe the title as apt. Reception Holocaust scholar Jeffrey Herf excoriates the book, writing that Schwanitz and Rubin \\"ignore the previous scholarship on Holocaust decision-making as well as the existing scholarship on Husseini's collaboration with the Nazis. Partly as a result, they exaggerate the Mufti's impact on Nazi policy. They turn a series of coincidental correlations in time into causal chains.\\" Reviewing the book in the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, Matthias K√ºntzel raises a number of issues with the book, identifying some of its claims as \\"nothing but speculation\\" and concluding that \\"certain facts that do not fit the picture have simply been left out,\\" damaging the book's credibility. In another article in the same journal, Meir Litvak calls the book \\"controversial\\" and argues its \\"allegations, however, do not stand the test of historical scrutiny and have been largely discounted.\\" In his review, Houwink ten Cate describes the book as \\"seminal\\" and \\"extremely well-researched and documented\\" but makes a \\"minor criticism\\": he is not convinced by Schwanitz and Rubin's argument that the mufti convinced the Nazis to commit the Holocaust, which he considers to be refuted by research by Christopher R. Browning that the authors ignored. David Mikics concurs, arguing that \\"the notion that al-Husaini played a key role in Hitler‚Äôs settling on the Final Solution is based on one piece of thin hearsay evidence.\\" He calls this claim \\"implausible, even silly.\\" Nils Riecken makes a similar criticism, that \\"temporal proximity remains their only argument.\\" He also criticizes the book for ignoring other research on the Holocaust, and sees the authors' methodology as \\"deeply problematic.\\" However, as one of the authors Schwanitz responded to Mikics, that he misrepresents the book and argues it \\"is not a biography of the grand mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husaini [...] and Mikics fails to show how it compares to related works.\\" David Rodman described the book as a \\"fascinating and insightful volume\\". Rodman opined that Nazism is no longer prominent in the West, but radical Arab nationalism and Islamism continue to be prominent in the Middle East. He called the book an \\"indispensable guide to explaining why the greater Middle East has been an utter shambles for the past seven decades\\". On the other hand, a review in Countercurrents.org questions whether the book contributes anything of value due to its ideological biases, \\"highly problematic theses,\\" and \\"bizarre theories.\\" Mia Lee contends that the book's \\"focus on the Mufti also creates a false link between contemporary anti-Semitism in the Middle East and the Nazis‚Äô racial programme.\\" References 2014 non- fiction books History books about the Holocaust Books about Islamism Books about Nazism Yale University Press books ","title":"Nazis, Islamists, and the Making of the Modern Middle East"},{"id":"63960100","text":"The Marquis de Ganay in 1868 when he was the Comte Etienne de Ganay, by James Tissot.

Themed around rallying, the game pit players with races across various locations under a short time limit to qualify for the next couse. The title proved to be a success for Gaelco, managing to sell 23,000 arcade units in Europe and earning an award from Gamest magazine. In 1995, a sequel titled World Rally 2: Twin Racing was released by Gaelco but garnered less success than its predecessor.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. World Rally is a top-down rally racing game reminiscent of Thrash Rally and Carlos Sainz on ZX Spectrum, where players observe from above and races across various countries by participating in a single race under a sixty second time limit.World Rally operator's manual (Arcade, ESP) Every location, composed of three stages each, has its own weather conditions and hazards that change how the car is controlled through the track, as well as shortcuts to gain time advantage. A direction indicator appears during gameplay, allowing players to known about an incoming turn. Players move into the next course by completing the race under sixty seconds, however, failing to do so results in a game over screen unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. A second player can also participate by alternating turns.  Development  World Rally was created by most of the same team that worked on previous projects at Zigurat Software such as Carlos Sainz for ZX Spectrum, with members of the creation team recounting the project's development process and history through multiple publications. Jorge Granados stated that the team wanted to make a racing game about Carlos Sainz and the World Rally Championship. They opted for an isometric perspective, their first attempt at this graphical style. The team's Fernando Rada said that coding the perspective was a major challenge, although it was made simpler by the new technology that the team was working with. Previously they had coded only for the 8-bit Z80 processor, but switched to the 16-bit 68000 for World Rally, programming the game in assembly. Rada said that the new setup was \\"much easier\\" to work with. Near the end of development when the game was ready for testing, Sainz changed teams from Toyota to Lancia. Granados later said that the game had been in production for almost two years, and that the technical chore of changing its assets to fit the new branding would have been \\"crazy\\". The car, which was a Toyota Celica GT-Four, was a scale model created and painted by the team before being digitized into the game, using 360 photography. As a result, Zigurat instead chose to drop Sainz from the game. Granados later said, \\"What we did was leave everything the same, and on the cover where Carlos Sainz appeared, we planted a gigantic helmet.\\"  Release  World Rally was first released in Spain and Japan by Gaelco and Sigma on July 1993, before being launched in North America by Atari Games on August of the same year. Prior to its launch, it was first playtested at the Sants neighborhood in Barcelona. The game was distributed on two variations; a standard upright variant and a deluxe variant. In a 1995 interview with Spanish magazine Hobby Hi-Tech, Jorge Granados claimed Zigurat Software were in talks with Sony about a potential conversion of the title for PlayStation, however this version was never released. It became notable in recent years due to being extremely difficult to play on emulators like MAME, as the arcade hardware implemented an advanced anti-piracy system until Gaelco co-founder Javier Valero provided unencrypted keys for the PCB in 2008 at a Spanish gaming conference, allowing it to be emulated and played. Gaelco later made its ROM image available as freeware.  Reception  While Gaelco's previous titles Big Karnak and Thunder Hoop had been commercially successful, researchers Manuel Garin and V√≠ctor Manuel Mart√≠nez cited World Rally as the studio's breakthrough title across Europe, where it attained \\"mass success\\". The game sold around 23,000 units in Europe and according to Jorge Granados, it achieved similar response worldwide. It remained Zigurat's biggest hit ever by 2014. Summarizing World Rallys performance, Granados remarked, \\"I won't tell you that we became rich, but we made money\\". Italian magazine Computer+Videogiochi praised its visuals. Electronic Gaming Monthly regarded the game as \\"endurance racing at its finest\\". In Japan, Game Machine listed the title on their 15 September 1993 issue as being the twelfth most- successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Saturday Night Slam Masters. French magazine Consoles + regarded the gameplay positively as \\"exemplary\\". Gamest awarded it in 1994 with the 75th \\"Annual Hit Game\\" prize. In recent years, the game has been played in tournaments on gaming-dedicated festivals in Spain and has since gained a cult following.  Sequel  A sequel, titled World Rally 2: Twin Racing, was released in 1995 by Gaelco but proved to be less popular than its predecessor.

T. Green is a political scientist and political psychologist. She studies variation in political attitudes and values across countries. Green uses experimental social psychology to measure the attitudes that people across many countries and groups hold towards members of other groups, as manifested for example through xenophobia, beliefs about immigration, and strength of national identity. Education and positions Green attended The University of Helsinki, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Social Science degree in 1995. In 1997, she obtained a graduate diploma in social psychology from The University of Helsinki. She then matriculated at The University of Geneva, where in 1998 she received a European diploma of advanced studies in social psychology. Then, in 2002, Green graduated from The University of Lausanne with a doctorate in social sciences. After obtaining her PhD, Green spent 2 years as a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2004, she moved to The University of Utrecht. She joined the faculty at The University of Lausanne as a professor in 2005. She has since held visiting or temporary positions at Ume√• University, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and The London School of Economics. Research Green studies variation in social values across countries, focusing on patterns in attitudes towards immigration, xenophobia, and national identity. She has measured the variation in individualism and collectivism across countries, finding that clusters of respondents' beliefs can be described by a typology that measures how competitive an individual is and how mutually reliant an individual is. Green has also probed the distinction between people who express a social dominance orientation and those who express a right-wing authoritarian orientation. Green has argued that for individuals whose motivation is social dominance, members of an out-group such as immigrants can provoke a negative response even when they are assimilated into the majority group because they blur the distinction between social groups; in contrast, those with an authoritarian motivation will be more resistant to immigrants who are not assimilated, because authoritarianism is motivated by an intolerance for difference between people. Her work has helped to demonstrate that social dominance orientation is a useful predictor of attitudes and behaviours across countries. In addition to studying variation in peoples' attitudes within countries and between ethnic groups, Green has also studied gender differences in attitudes. Green served a term as the President of the International Society of Political Psychology, ending in 2018. She also held the position of Vice President at the International Society of Political Psychology. She has been an editor of The European Journal of Social Psychology and The International Review of Social Psychology, and has been on the editorial board of several other journals including the British Journal of Social Psychology.

Two early copies survive, one in the Galleria nazionale di Parma and the other in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, in which a toothed wheel (attribute of Catherine of Alexandria) is added beside the female saint. The Vienna painting was previously considered an autograph work and that in Frankfurt as a copy, but in 1932 art historians reversed their opinion after an X-ray revealed a fine under-drawing under pesanti and re-paintings on the Frankfurt work. All art historians except Copertini (1945-1950) and Fr√∂lich-Bum (1953) now hold the Frankfurt work to be autograph. Freedberg dated the work to around 1524 based on comparison with the Doria Madonna (Galleria Doria-Pamphili) and the portrait of Paola Gonzaga in the Stufetta of Diana and Actaeon at Fontanellato, particularly regarding the pose and the saint's face.

Stewart; 1925 ‚Äì May 30, 2014), was best known as Captain Don, The Father of Bonaire. In the early 1950s, he invented and patented an \\"adapter for screen cloth\\" which is basically the frame for a screen door. He was also a story teller, an advanced scuba diver, an environmental activist and protector of the coral reefs that fringe the coastline of Bonaire, a small island in the Caribbean Netherlands where Stewart lived most of his life. Early life Don Stewart was born in the San Francisco Bay area of California. His mother died when he was a young boy, and was raised by his father. He was diagnosed as dyslexic, dropped out of high school and at age 17, joined the United States Navy shortly after the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. He signed up for medical training while in the Navy, and by age 19, was serving as Chief Medical Officer of the USS Persistent (MSO-491). He was later diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and was discharged from the Navy. Arrival on Bonaire Stewart was penniless when he first arrived on Bonaire in May 1962 but quite eager to make things happen. A friend once quipped in an interview that, \\"no matter what Don tells you, the truth is he stayed in Bonaire because that's where his ship sank\\". Stewart was instrumental in opening Zeebad, Bonaire's first hotel and dive operation.\\"Joel Simon\\", Bonaire's bountiful reefs\\", Montreal Gazette (November 23, 1996), p. I-1, 3. It was built on property that was once a German detention camp, and over time, the hotel grew to become Divi Flamingo Beach Resort & Casino. In the late 1960s, Irwin Hasen, who was a cartoonist with the Chicago Tribune Syndicate at the time, had created the cartoon character \\"Dondi\\" which was published daily in more than a hundred newspapers. During a trip to Bonaire, Hasen met Captain Don, and created a segment in the Dondi comic-strip that illustrated Captain Don teaching Dondi how to scuba dive, and preserve the coral reefs. Significance to Bonaire After Stewart arrived on Bonaire, he realized the importance of protecting its fragile ecosystem, both above and below the ocean. He introduced permanent mooring systems to protect the island's fringing reefs, and spearheaded a campaign that banned spearfishing and tropical fish collecting on Bonaire. He named most of the dive sites on the island, and in 1976, founded a resort hotel of his own, and named it Captain Don's Habitat. He was inducted into the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame in 2005. One of his memorable quotes when greeting scuba divers to the island was simply, \\"Take only pictures and memories, leave only bubbles.‚Äù He was quite serious about not touching the corals or harming the fish, which led to the founding of Bonaire Marine Park.

Yesha was first mentioned in around 1410 in the postil of ≈Åukasz of Wielki Ko≈∫min in which he was warning about the worship of Yesha and other gods such as Niya, Lada and Kij during spring rituals and folk performances. According to Jan D≈Çugosz, he was the highest of the Lechitic gods and the equivalent to Roman god Jupiter. The name of the god most likely took the form of \\"Jesza\\". In the 15th century, the Polish voiceless retroflex fricative sound (today written as sz), was written as a double s. The word jesza, as noted by Aleksander Br√ºckner, also appears in the Old Church Slavonic language as a wish particle \\"may!\\".  Study  From the beginning of the Renaissance, church documents regarding the prohibition and combating of the worship of the god Yesha in Poland were gradually forgotten or even lost. On the other hand, messages from Jan D≈Çugosz and Maciej of Miech√≥w remained known and available. In the following centuries, the information about Yesha was accepted without reservations, all the more so because Maciej of Miech√≥w, in a fragment devoted to the god Jesse, repeated D≈Çugosz's information without reservations. Then, at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the entire message of D≈Çugosz and earlier church sources were subjected to too harsh, as is often believed, criticism in the research of Alexander Br√ºckner. This researcher, not taking into account or not knowing the oldest message about the god Yesha - Postil of Ko≈∫minczyk - noticed that the very word jesza in the church language meant 'may' additionally hypothesizing that it could not, as in his opinion accidentally heard in folk songs, be the name old god. This position, despite being seriously questioned already at the beginning of the 20th century by, among others, Karol Potka≈Ñski, managed to find continuators in the form of researchers such as Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski or Stanis≈Çaw Urba≈Ñczyk, which in effect led to the objection in the academic discourse. Nowadays, after the rejection of Alexander Br√ºckner's hypercritical attitude, Jan D≈Çugosz's report is increasingly recognized as valuable, and on a comparative basis worthy of further research. Religious expert and archaeologist prof. W≈Çodzimierz Szafra≈Ñski even notes that Br√ºckner's findings can hardly be considered consistent with the scientific method, in part simply describing them as libel against the person of the chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz. Currently, analogous remarks on the work style of Alexander Br√ºckner, including excessive preference for digression, are made by religious expert Andrzej Szyjewski. In addition, information about the remaining deities from Old Polish reports, depending on the publication, is considered valuable by such researchers as the above- mentioned W≈Çodzimierz Szafra≈Ñski and Andrzej Szyjewski as well as Marek Cetwi≈Ñski, Marek Derwich, Leszek Kolankiewicz and Aleksander Gieysztor, among others. Esus (sculpture from the Galician altar found in Paris) = Interpretation of W≈Çodzimierz Szafra≈Ñski = According to Szafra≈Ñski, Yesha could have been a Panslavic or even Indo-European god. He also believed that Yesha was associated with the Celtic Esus, who on the altar discovered under the Notre Dame Cathedral is depicted as a god cutting down a tree, and in which in the tripartite division of Georges Dum√©zil he is compared to Jupiter and Odin. This speaks for the truthfulness of comparing Yesha to Jupiter. The etymology of the name of god is under discussion. Szafra≈Ñski emphasizes that the name of the Yesha has a clear etymological relationship with Esus, whose name is derived, as in the case of the Nordic √Üsir (in Old Norse √°ss, √≥ss meant \\"god\\"), from the same Indo-European root *ansu- (master, ruler, god). Also derived from this root is the Avestan word ahura meaning \\"master, lord\\" which later became the nickname of Zoroaster god Ahura Mazda as \\"Lord of Wisdom\\", to whom yasna ritual is dedicated, Sanskrit word √°sura meaning \\"divine, powerful\\" or Hittite ·∏´a≈°≈°u≈° meaning \\"king\\". In the case of the second form of the name of the deity - \\"Yasha\\" - Szafra≈Ñski notes that additional influence on its shape (apart from Celtic Esus) could have been exerted by the Sarmatian / Alanian tribe of Jasz people, which at some point was in parts of today's Poland. = Interpretation of Leszek Kolankiewicz = According to Kolankiewicz, Jesza was the Polish equivalent of Dadzbog (or Svarog assuming that Dadzb√≥g is the local equivalent of Svarog) stating that the names of both gods actually mean the same. This is argued by the fact that in the East Slavic languages the word jesza was a wish particle and the equivalent of the Latin word utinam and quotes examples of citations collected in various dictionaries, e.g. je≈°a i nie s—åbrali s—åbora, je≈°a i sicie nie biesƒïdowali is tranlated as \\"may they not assemble the council, may they not say so\\". He also gives specific translations of the word jesza according to various dictionaries, e.g. the S≈Çowar' russkiego jazyka defines the word jesza as \\"in order to, if\\" and Handw√∂rterbuch zu den altkirchenslavischen Texten reports that the word jesza was originally a third person singular form in the optative mood of the word jesm—å (\\"I am\\"), and that word come from the Proto- Indo-European *esiƒìt, hence the proto-Slavic *≈°a (Polish sza) to which the current e- from the present tense passed, and so the meaning \\"that there could be\\" could easly evolve to \\"may\\". The second wishful particle is the word is bodaj and quotes the 15th century wish Bogdaj mu zaleg≈Ç usta wrzod (\\"God, let the ulcer shut his mouth\\") with a clear structure \\"God, let it be!, God, let it happen!, please, God!\\" and this brings associations with Dadzbog, whose name is translated in two ways: as daƒá-b√≥g (daƒá means \\"to give\\") ‚Äì \\"God- giver\\", or as dag-b√≥g, where the first term comes from the proto-Indo-European core *dag meaning \\"to burn, incinerate\\" ‚Äì \\"God-burner\\". So Yesha, like Dadzbog, would be a god of sun and fire, a giver, a punishing and burning god. At the same time, he states that since Lada is always mentioned in the sources first, she (or he) could be the most important god.  Sources  Yesha was also mentioned by Marcin Bielski and his son Joachim and priest Jakub Wujek.

He has been described as a \\"far-right conspiricist\\" by the New York Times, and he has been demonetized by YouTube for infractions related to hate speech and disinformation.  Music and YouTube career Moura founded his band, Pandora101, alongside his brother Gugo in 1999, when Moura was 17. He played guitar and performed vocals, while Gugo played the bass. They made four albums and a few singles. However, he rarely performs live, with only two or three shows a year. Moura was inspired by groups including Whitesnake, Iron Maiden, Kiss, Pantera, and Death. To explain his band's lack of success, Mora attributes what he sees as Brazil's lack of appreciation for quality music. As of March 2016, Moura's channel had 500,000 subscribers and a total of 87 million views. Created in 2012, his channel initially concentrated on his band, Pandora101, as well as metal and pop culture. In late 2014, however, he shifted to discussion of conservatism, highlighting \\"logic\\" and aggression in his approach. As of 2016, Moura included references to Plato, Aristotle, Padre Paulo Ricardo, and others, using a rhetorical style that Moura describes as somewhat priestly, reflecting his education at and Adventist college. Moura says he went to an Adventist college. Moura imitates, ridicules, and uses nicknames for Pirula (a biologist) and Maestro Bogs (a musician and militant atheist), two other Youtubers. As of 2016, Moura described himself as a liberal conservative, saying that he placed importance on preserving the good that society had produced, and supporting freedom in individuals' actions. However, he opposed treating homosexual couples in the same manner as heterosexual ones, arguing that the former could not raise a child effectively, and arguing with references to Plato and Aristotle. Moura benefited from how YouTube's algorithm in how (at least prior to 2019) it directed users to novel content. In February 2019, YouTube demonetized many of Moura's videos, after which Moura released several videos complaining about this decision. Though Moura supported Jair Bolsonaro prior to his election and during his early term, he came to speak out strongly against Bolsonaro, calling him a traitor in a 2019 tweet criticizing the passage an 'anti-crime' package.  Influence  Estadao describes Moura in 2019 as once being among the most influential online defenders of Bolsonaro.

At the age of 14, her parents married her to a 70-year old man. The marriage failed, and at the age of 16, she escaped to Casablanca with the singer Benacer OukhouyaAround the World in 575 Songs: Africa: Traditional Music from all the World's Countries - Volume 2 - Nick Wall (2018).. There she learned Arabic, and started to sing professionally in Oukhouya's band. Gradually, Hadda's notability became to grow, and she founded her own group in 1981 with the singer Abdellah Zahrawi. Both performed several songs that became famous in Morocco in general, and the Middle Atlas region in particular.

He was one of the pupils of Kazimierz Twardowski. Drawing from his mentor's theories and the tradition of the Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw school, his works dealt with the problem of induction. Bandrowski was also noted for his death in the Tatra Mountains near Zakopane.  Background  Bandrowski was born on 27 May 1879 in Mo≈õciska (Galicia, Austria-Hungary). He was the son of Alfred Bandrowski, a court clerk, and Joanna n√©e ZajƒÖczkowska. He was also the nephew of the Polish opera tenor Aleksander Bandrowski and the cousin of the writer Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski. After finishing high school, Bandrowski took classical philology and philosophy at the University of Lviv. He became one of the founding members of the Polish Philosophical Society and an active member and editor of the journal Ruch Filozoficzny (Philosophical Movement).  Works  Bandrowski's doctoral dissertation, On methods of induction research, is considered one of his most notable works. It included a critical analysis of the intrinsic qualities of induction. In this paper, he also maintained that ‚Äì to analyze induction ‚Äì the question concerning the qualities of the notion of cause must first be answered. Together with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Witwicki, Bandrowski developed a model of psychology based on Franz Brentano's theory on phenomenology. It included an analysis of Edmund Husserl's works (e.g. theory of content and the Phenomenon of thinking). Bandrowski rejected the German philosopher's method in his embrace of the descriptive-psychological method and logical analysis. Bandrowski also authored the report containing the discussions of a 1912 Krakow congress organized by the Neurological and Psychiatric Section of the Warsaw Medical Society. The report was devoted to Sigmund Freud's concept of hysteria as well as contemporaneous issues concerning the psychoanalytical movement. Bandrowski argued that there is no significant difference between the results of Freud's theory and the findings of contemporary psychological theories if his theory is formulated using the terminology of the latter.  Death  In July 1914, Bandrowski went on a hiking trip in Tatra Mountains near Zakopane together with his sister and fiance Anna Hackbeil√≥wna. The three got lost while descending Czarny GƒÖsienicowy Pond. Hackbeil√≥wna fell to her death in the descent while Bandrowski and his sister got trapped on a rocky ledge called . Having lost hope, Bandrowski threw himself into an abyss after three days waiting for help. His sister was later rescued by a TOPR rescue expedition led by Mariusz Zaruski.

She has released two albums: 50,000,000 Million Elvis Fans Can‚Äôt Be Wrong (2014) and No Fool Like an Old Fool (2018). Background Originally from Huntsville, Alabama, Sallee moved to Austin, Texas in 2013. Caroline Says is named after the Lou Reed song of the same name, which appeared on his album Berlin. Her music has been compared to that of Alvvays, Beach House, Molly Burch, Lucy Dacus, The Drums, Grizzly Bear, Mazzy Star, Real Estate, Faye Webster and Yo La Tengo. She has cited Animal Collective, The Beach Boys, Bon Iver, Bruce Springsteen and Steely Dan as influences. 50,000,000 Million Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong (2014) Sallee's debut album 50,000,000 Million Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong, named after Elvis Presley's compilation album 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong: Elvis' Gold Records, Volume 2 (1959), was released in 2014, shortly after she moved to Austin, and reissued in 2017. Will Hermes, writing in Rolling Stone, noted the album's \\"lovelorn wistfulness\\" and described it as \\"a warm swarm of multi- tracked vocals and simple melodies\\". AllMusics Tim Sendra described the album as \\"a fully realized and impressive debut that shows Sallee is both a songwriting and recording prodigy of sorts, but also a very inventive vocalist.\\" Writing for Pitchfork, Philip Cosores noted that \\"Sallee packs numerous songwriting and recording styles into the collection\\" and identified \\"Lost Feeling\\" as \\"the record‚Äôs best and most Lou Reed-sounding song\\". No Fool Like an Old Fool (2018) No Fool Like an Old Fool, Sallee's second album, was released in 2018. Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork described No Fool Like an Old Fool as \\"an album that sounds familiar but feels new in its specific way of manifesting dread\\" and praised \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" as a \\"perfectly balanced\\" standout. Austin Brown of Flood Magazine described the album as \\"less wistful and more jaded\\" than its predecessor and praised \\"I Tried\\" as the song in which \\"Caroline Says thrives best‚Äîthinking, even dreaming about the future, but bracing oneself for the reality that it never quite turns out like you hope it will.\\" Andrew Gordon of The Skinny also compared it to 50,000,000 Million Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong, noting that it \\"retreats further into the shadows, an even quieter and more withdrawn affair\\" than the earlier album, and wrote that \\"Sallee‚Äôs songs tend to expand outwards, the feeling established at the outset spreading itself thinner as the loops cover more area.\\" The Line of Best Fits Ian King identified \\"I Tried\\" as evidence that while \\"the assumption with hushed solo songwriters is often that their lyrical themes are dominated by introspection, ... Sallee makes a point to step outside of her own perspective from time to time and try to occupy a different mindset from her own\\" and noted that \\"modest means and humble ends shape the character of No Fool Like An Old Fool.\\" Marcy Donelson of AllMusic wrote that \\"'No Fool Like an Old Fool curbs some of the brightest moments of [Sallee's] debut, inhabiting a warm breeze, daydreams, and lingering regret\\", and concluded that \\"the album is at once rich, restrained, and beguiling.\\" Reviewing the album for The Austin Chronicle, Libby Webster wrote that Salle's vocals \\"never reach above a mumble, but a sleepy desperation quavers throughout her songs.\\" Ohio River (2019) The Ohio River EP was released in 2019. Reviewing the EP for Pitchfork, Abby Jones described it as a meditation on mortality and the transitory quality of life, and suggested that, \\"if [No Fool Like an Old Fool] was a starting point, then Ohio River lies somewhere along the journey to Sallee‚Äôs next destination.\\" In June 2020 Sallee released a cover of Spacemen 3's \\"So Hot (Wash Away All of My Tears)\\" as a fundraiser for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

In: HFMT Hamburg.BBC: The first female professor in the UK (Emma Ritter-Bondy). In 1892 she was appointed the first professor of piano at the Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. She was the first music professor and the first professor at a university in Great Britain. She was the first woman in the UK to become a professor almost 16 years before Edith Morley. Morley was appointed professor of English literature at the University of Reading in 1908. She was classically considered the first professor in Great Britain.  Life and work  Ritter-Bondy was born in Graz in 1838 as Emma Maria Bondy. In the mid-1850s she studied piano in the class of Josef Fischhof at the Vienna Conservatory. In 1862 she married artist Franz Ritter. Around 1868, the couple moved to Koblenz after getting to know the city on a concert tour. Here, she also worked at K√∂niglichen Gymnasium zu Coblenz, today's G√∂rres-Gymnasium, as a music teacher. The couple had two children, daughter Ida (born 14 March 1874) and son Camillo (born 3 December 1875). The latter later became a well- known violinist and music professor. Her husband died in January 1879. Ritter- Bondy decided to leave Koblenz with her family in 1881 and to build a new home in Glasgow. She probably chose this city because she was actively involved in the Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music, who at the time was looking for talented musicians all over Europe. In 1892 she was appointed professor of piano at this conservatory. In the same year she and her two children became British citizens. Overall, relatively little is known about Emma Ritter as a professor due to the limited number of files at the Royal Conservatoire of Scottland . Irina Vaterl gives further primary sources about Emma Ritter-Bondy on her document at the HFMT Hamburg. The first scientific work on Emma Ritter- Bondy is the work by Vaterl listed under Literature. According to the referenced BBC document, Emma Ritter gave a public concert together with her highly musical children at the Athenaeum Hall in Glasgow in 1893. Ritter-Bondy had already given public concerts during her time in Graz and Vienna, for example on 27 February 1867 in Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Ritter-Bondy died in Glasgow on 23 June 1894. In her will, she decreed that her two children should receive the best possible musical education. This should preferably be done in Berlin or London. The two children actually completed their education in Berlin (Camillo) and London (Ida). \\"While daughter Ida made a name for herself as a piano accompanist, son Camillo became known as a violin virtuoso and teacher.\\"  Literature  * References 1838 births 1894 deaths People from Graz Scottish classical pianists British music educators Women music educators 19th- century classical pianists Austro-Hungarian emigrants to the United Kingdom Scottish people of Austrian descent ","title":"Emma Ritter-Bondy"},{"id":"63960693","text":"Phoenix Netts is a formerly unidentified woman whose body was found hidden in two suitcases in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, near the England‚ÄìWales border in May 2020. Investigation =Discovery= The investigation began after a member of the public reported their suspicions to police about a car being driven erratically on the A4136 road near Coleford in the Forest of Dean. Police located the car a short while later and they spoke to two people. Two suitcases containing human remains were found, two people arrested and a vehicle seized. The remains were found around 11:30pm. =Search= A search began of Stowfield quarry and the village of Staunton. There was a large police presence in the area, a police helicopter and several roads were closed. The A4136 was closed between Monmouth and Coleford and closures were expected to remain until Friday 15 May 2020. On Friday 15 May 2020 police searched properties in Wolverhampton and Birmingham as well as using DNA tests to identify the victim. =Police statements= Detective chief inspector John Turner, the senior investigating officer, said \\"The nature of this incident is distressing and we‚Äôre working around the clock to fully understand what has happened. Someone‚Äôs life has been lost and our priority is to identify the victim and get answers for her family.

She was remanded to appear in Gloucester Crown Court on 19 May 2020. A 38 year old man from Wolverhampton has been charged with assisting an offender between 25 April and 12 May 2020 and was also remanded to appear before Gloucester Crown Court on 19 May 2020. Both have been refused bail appeared before magistrates in Cheltenham via video-link. Identification The remains were identified via DNA tests as those of Phoenix Netts, a 28 year old woman from Birmingham. Detectives from West Midlands police have taken over the investigation from Gloucestershire police. Their investigations have focused on a women's refuge in Birmingham. Conditional bail was granted to the man from Wolverhampton.

Early life Ridgway was born on April 18, 1768 in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey. He was the youngest of five children born to John Ridgway and Phebe (n√©e Bellanger) Ridgway, who were members of the Society of Friends. His father died when he was around six or seven years old and his mother died when he was around sixteen, after which he went to Philadelphia with his older sister and her husband, who he chose as his guardian. Career Ridgway studied the wholesale dry goods business under Samuel Shaw and succeeded as a partner in the business with his son, Thomas Shaw. He later went into partnership with his brother-in-law, James Smith, until the business was sold to Joseph Pryor. Ridgway and Smith then went into the shipping business and were very successful before the Napoleonic Wars between England and France when their ships were seized. Finding it necessary to live abroad to protect their property, Ridgway moved to London where he ran the business before settling in Antwerp where he succeeded Isaac Coxe Barnet, to serve as Consul for the United States appointed by President Thomas Jefferson. While there, he also became a partner in Merton & Ridgway, while still continuing the firm of Smith & Ridgway. While he was the United States' commercial agent at Antwerp, he corresponded with Secretary of State James Madison and Robert R. Livingston was America's Minister to France. Ridgway requested Livingston's assistance with procuring an acknowledgment of his commission from the French government. =Real estate= While abroad, he sent his income back to Philadelphia to invest in real estate property. In the early 1800s, as part of a larger land purchase, he acquired that became Elk County. His nephew, James Gillis, convinced him the area could become a lucrative lumber camp due to the proximity of Elk Creek and the Clarion River, a tributary of the Allegheny River. The area, which was named Ridgway, Pennsylvania in his honor, became an industrial center where they manufactured leather, iron, clay, and lumber products, silk goods, railroad snow plows, dynamos, and machine tools. Personal life In the winter of 1794, Ridgway was married to Rebecca Rawle (1773‚Äì1817), a daughter of Benjamin Rawle and Hannah (n√©e Hudson) Rawle. Together, they were the parents of: * Susan Ridgway (1797‚Äì1885), who married Thomas Rotch (1792‚Äì1840) in 1816. After his death, she married, as his second wife, Dr. John Rhea Barton in 1843. * Phoebe Anne Ridgway (1799‚Äì1857), who married Dr. James Rush in 1820. * Caroline Ridgway (1804‚Äì1820), who died unmarried. * John Jacob Ridgway (1807‚Äì1885), who married Elisabeth Willing (1819‚Äì1904) in 1836.

After a three week illness, Ridgway died on April 30, 1843 on Chesnut Street, opposite Independence Hall, in Philadelphia. At the time of his death, he was the wealthiest man in Philadelphia, and was likely the second wealthiest person in the United States behind John Jacob Astor. His son managed his real estate empire. =Descendants= Through his eldest daughter Susan, he was a grandfather of Alice Caroline Barton (1833‚Äì1903), who married Edward Shippen Willing. They were the parents of Susan Ridgway Willing (wife of Francis Cooper Lawrance Jr.), John Rhea Barton Willing (who did not marry), and Ava Lowle Willing (wife of John Jacob Astor IV until their divorce in 1910, and, thereafter, to Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale).The Historical Society of Pennsylvania (HSP), Frank Willing Leach, Genealogies of Old Philadelphia Families Published in the Sunday North American, vol. 1, p. 133.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by Caliber Yachts in the United States, starting in 1992, but it is now out of production. Design The Caliber 40 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wood trim. It has a cutter rig, with anodized aluminum spars, a bowsprit, a raked stem and reverse transom, with a swing-down swimming ladder and hand-held shower. It features a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. The boat displaces and carries of ballast. The design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double \\"V\\"-berth in the bow cabin, an \\"L\\"-shaped settee and a straight settee in the main cabin and an aft cabin with a double berth on the starboard side. The galley is located on the port side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is \\"L\\"-shaped and is equipped with a two-burner liquid petroleum gas stove, an oven, an icebox and a double sink. The cockpit also has its own icebox. A navigation station is at the aft end of the galley, on the port side. There are two heads, one in the bow cabin on the starboard side and one on the starboard side in the aft cabin, that can also be accessed from the main cabin. Both heads have showers, with hot and cold pressurized water. The interior is all finished in teak and has of headroom. Ventilation is provided by 14 stainless steel opening ports, seven hatches and two deck vent cowlings. For sailing the design is equipped with a mainsheet traveler to the deck. The halyards are mounted internally and the boat has two backstays. There are two speed, self- tailing winches for the mainsheet, halyards and the genoas. The outhaul is rigged internally and there is a main topping lift. The mainsail is equipped with two reefing points, with lines aft to the cockpit. Variants ;Caliber 40 :This model was introduced in 1992. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat has a Japanese Yanmar LIJH3E diesel engine. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of and there is a holding tank forward. ;Caliber 40 LRC :This \\"Long Range Cruiser\\" model was introduced in 1995 and brought increased tank capacities, with aluminum fuel and water tanks. It has a draft of with the standard keel. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 4JH3 (B)E diesel engine. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . Operational history In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood described the Caliber 40 as, \\"a big cutter for cruising, with high displacement, and lots of ballast for stability.\\" Jack Hornor reviewed the boat in the Spinsheet in January 2009, saying, \\"designed by Caliber‚Äôs co- founder, Michael McCreary, the Caliber 40 LRC is moderate in nearly every way. This underbody features a long, low-aspect fin keel and rudder supported by a skeg forward and is a good compromise between the performance benefits of fin- keeled, spade-rudder designs and the directional stability of traditional full-keel designs. Above the waterline, the Caliber 40 LRC is not likely to win any accolades for her classic beauty, but her appearance is well-balanced and contemporary.\\" Zuzana Prochazka wrote a review of the design in 2010 for boats.com, stating, \\"Caliber 40 from Caliber Yachts fits the bill as a couple's boat for blue water cruising ... The design is a moderately heavy displacement cruising boat so it takes a bit of wind to get her going. However, like most cruising boats of this class, sailing 5 ‚Äì 5.5 knots in 10 ‚Äì 12 knots of wind on a beam reach is not bad and can provide 140 mile plus days in the tradewinds. Although the sheeting angles have been tightened as the tracks have been brought inboard, sailing to within 60 degrees of the apparent wind can be expected. Although the boat will kick around in heavy seas, it will do so no more than other cruising boats and it will remain fairly comfortable in big waves as well as big winds.\\" A Blue Water Sailing reader survey summary concluded, \\"a lot of thought has gone into the conception, construction and marketing of the Caliber 40LRC(Long Range Cruiser). That‚Äôs your overriding thought as you study the plans and exhaustive product information provided by Caliber Yachts, Inc. of Clearwater, Florida. Owners of this boat who cruised through the Blue Water Sailing Subscriber Survey appear to be in complete agreement. Says one: 'A well constructed boat, interestingly conceived, reasonably priced.'\\" A review in Sailing Magazine by Greta Reichelsdorfer concluded after a sail in the design, \\"I stepped back into the cockpit for a last look around deck. From the swim step with a freshwater shower to the tip of its sturdy anchor roller on the bowsprit, this boat is one well-built cruiser.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Baltic 40 *Bayfield 40 *Bermuda 40 *Bristol 40 *Dickerson 41 *Endeavour 40 *Islander 40 *Lord Nelson 41 *Nordic 40 References Keelboats Dinghies 1990s sailboat type designs Sailing yachts ","title":"Caliber 40"},{"id":"63960852","text":"Lake Tilden, also considered part of nearby Black Lake,Orange County Water Atlas. is a natural freshwater lake on the west side of Orlando, Florida, in Orange County, Florida.

The nave of the church is the oldest surviving part, dating from the early 12th century. In 1340, the present bell tower was built and the chancel was enlarged. The four bells in the tower date from 1670 and 1744. Further changes to the church were made in 1733, with the addition of the north aisle, which aimed to house the pew for the Lord of the Manor, William Perry. The north aisle also includes a marble monument to William Perry. Two armorial glass windows in the south wall commemorate the connection of the Parry family with the church. \\"Church History\\", The Hambleden Valley Group of Churches. Retrieved on 14 May 2020. Restoration The church was restored on numerous occasions, notably in 1875 when the chancel floor was raised, in 1901 when the vestry was constructed, in 1972 when the roof was repaired and, in 1996 with the new bell-frame and re-tuned peal. The 1901 restoration uncovered a stone coffin containing two skeletons, one dating from the 16th century which had a hole in the skull, indicating a possible murder victim.

Changes in sBCMA levels have been found to correlate with a MM patient‚Äôs clinical status in response to treatment.  Role in biology  BCMA is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, expressed on the cell surface of maturing plasma cells and is involved in supporting normal survival of long-lived plasma cells, production of antibodies, and class switching of immunoglobulins. In MM, BCMA promotes the proliferation and survival of MM cells and is associated with the immunosuppression which is the hallmark of MM. The BCMA molecule is the receptor for APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) and BAFF (B-cell activating factor, also known as BLyS).The binding of APRIL and BAFF to the membrane bound form of BCMA stimulates B-cell proliferation and antibody production. The membrane bound BCMA can be cleaved by gamma secretase, resulting in sBCMA, and released into the blood.  Clinical significance  Serum BCMA is found at low levels in the serum or plasma of normal patients and is generally elevated in patients with MM. sBCMA levels have been found to correlate with the severity of myeloma disease and shown to be predictive of response to therapy. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in MM patients have also correlated with levels of sBCMA. Changes in sBCMA also correlate with changes in disease status among MM patients. In addition to MM, sBCMA also appears to correlate with disease progression in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering myeloma (SMM) and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). = As a biomarker = When BCMA is cleaved from the cell membrane of plasma cells by gamma secretase, a ubiquitous intramembranous protease enzyme, it is solubilized in the serum, where it can accumulate and bind to various targets including BAFF and APRIL. Patients with MM generally have higher levels of sBCMA. Solubilized BCMA can sequester BAFF, preventing it from signaling B cells, resulting in reduced polyclonal antibody levels in patients with MM. In multiple studies, sBCMA levels have been found to correlate with the severity of myeloma. Notably, sBCMA levels are predictive of response to therapy, PFS and OS. In addition, changes in sBCMA predict changes in clinical status more rapidly than conventional markers that are used to track MM patients. For this reason, the biomarker has been used in diagnostic evaluation of myeloma and other B-cell disorders. = In therapeutics = sBCMA can bind to anti-BCMA antibodies used as therapeutics in treating MM. It has been shown that the high levels of BCMA present in the serum of MM patients can inhibit the effectiveness of BCMA-directed therapy. For this reason, the gamma secretase enzyme has been the target of some recent drug therapies. These drugs aim to inhibit the action of the gamma secretase enzyme, thus both increasing the density of BCMA on the MM cell while at the same time lowering the levels of sBCMA in the blood and allowing anti-BCMA antibodies to more effectively bind to the target cells. = In diagnostics = sBCMA has been measured and evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in numerous investigational studies of MM related B-cell diseases. Although still investigational, sBCMA appears to be a novel biomarker to track MM such as M-protein and serum Free Light Chain (FLC). All three biomarkers are generally elevated on initial evaluation of MM, tend to increase as the severity of disease increases, and decrease as patients respond to therapy. Because levels of the biomarkers appear to correlate with disease severity, they have been used in diagnostics as a way to monitor patients‚Äô disease and evaluate response to therapy. Preliminary investigations have indicated that sBCMA, unlike M protein or FLC, is independent of the patient‚Äôs kidney function, and may offer an advantage to monitoring those patients. Additionally, sBCMA is expressed in non-secretory MM, a subset of MM in which patients do not express high enough levels of M protein or SFLC to be accurately followed using these two biomarkers. These patientsgenerally need to undergo bone marrow biopsies frequently to evaluate their status. The sBCMA biomarker may offer an alternative means to evaluate this subset of patients. = In related diseases = Levels of sBCMA appear to progressively increase along the spectrum of plasma cell-related disorders. Serum BCMA is increased in patients with active MM compared with healthy controls. Levels of sBCMA were determined in 196 healthy subjects and showed a right-tailed distribution with a median value of 37.51 ng/mL with a standard deviation of 22.54 ng/mL (range 18.78 -180.39 ng/mL). Among patients with MM, sBCMA levels correlated with the percentage of malignant cells, giving rise to the concept that sBCMA may reflect a patient‚Äôs tumor burden. Levels of sBCMA among patients with MM were elevated when compared with healthy controls (P<0.0001) and those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (P=0.0157). Furthermore, sBCMA levels were significantly higher among patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) and untreated active MM patients than healthy donors (P<0.0001). In a retrospective study of MGUS and SMM patients, the highest levels of sBCMA were observed among patients with SMM who progressed to MM, intermediate levels were seen in patients with MGUS who progressed to MM, and lowest baseline levels were found among patients with MGUS who did not progress to MM. The change in sBCMA over time was lowest in the non-progressing patients with MGUS. Sometimes, MM patients show undetectable levels of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) in the serum or urine. For this reason, these patients are generally monitored using bone marrow biopsies and PET CT scans. It has been found, however, that sBCMA can be reliably measured in these patients, and correlates well with disease activity and changes in their PET scans and the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells during the course of disease. = In response to treatment = sBCMA has been investigated among MM patients undergoing numerous treatment regiments. Changes in sBCMA levels were found to correlate with changes in an individual patient‚Äôs clinical status in response to treatment for MM. Additionally, sBCMA levels were significantly higher among patients with progressive disease than in patients with disease responsive to treatment (P=0.0038). Interestingly, sBCMA levels correlated with response to treatment, independent of the type of treatment. Among patients starting new treatment, changes in sBCMA levels from baseline to one week later (cycle 1 day 8) were found to predict PFS, with >25% increase or decrease in serum BCMA levels on cycle 1 day 8 indicating a much shorter or longer time on treatment, respectively. = As predictor of progression free survival and overall survival = Serum BCMA levels have been reported to predict both PFS and overall survival (OS) in MM. In a study by Ghermezi et al., sBCMA levels were predictive of PFS and OS among patients with MM. PFS was significantly longer for patients with sBCMA levels below the median (326.4 ng/mL) versus those with levels above the median (median, 9.0 vs 3.6 months; P=0.0006). Similarly, OS was significantly longer among those with sBCMA levels below the median compared with those above (median, 155 vs 96 months; P =0.0108). MM patients with sBCMA levels above the median had significantly shorter survival compared with patients with levels below the median concentration (P=0.0014). Patients in the highest quartile showed a markedly shortened survival compared with the remainder of the patients (P=0.0003). In a prospective Phase 1 trial of sBCMA to predict clinical outcomes among patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with lenalidomide, ruxolitinib and methylprednisolone, baseline sBCMA levels were found to be predictive of PFS. Specifically, patients with a baseline sBCMA level in the highest quartile (range, 414.7 ‚Äì 1655.1 ng/mL) had a significantly shorter PFS than those in the lowest three quartiles (range, 10.3 ‚Äì 318.2 ng/mL; median PFS: 1.12 vs. 6.64 months; P=0.006). In the same prospective Phase 1 trial, changes in sBCMA during the first cycle study treatment accurately predicted patients later best response. Notably, changes in sBCMA occurred more rapidly than changes in either M-protein or FLC. Studies to further investigate the role of sBCMA in predicting OS and PFS are ongoing.

The group's music is a unique combination of experimental noise and industrial music with gospel and spoken word performance. Their lyrics directly reference themes of racism, colonialism, and homophobia. ONO is made up of core members vocalist travis (n√©e Travis Dobbs) and multi-instrumentalist P. Michael, alongside a rotating lineup of musical collaborators.  History  = Early years (1980 - 1986) = Prior to joining the group, travis grew up playing piano in church and singing spirituals in his home of rural Mississippi. He served in the US Navy during the Vietnam War, a formative period during which he experienced severe racial discrimination and sexual violence. Native Chicagoan P. Michael grew up in a musical family which included several noted jazz musicians. Prior to forming ONO, he studied music and visual art and worked in academia. ONO began with the meeting of travis and P. Michael in 1980. An early supporter and friend of the group was Al Jourgenson of Ministry, through whom they met scholar, performance artist, and musician Shannon Rose Riley. She has subsquently worked with the band from the 80s to the present. The name \\"ONO\\" was derived in part from onomatopoeia, to emphasize the non-musical, \\"noise\\" character of their sound. The group developed a unique juxtaposition of industrial musique concr√®te and junk metal percussion alongside spoken word and liturgical organ. P. Michael's music was inspired by The Stooges and The Velvet Underground, whereas travis' vocals drew inspiration from Mahalia Jackson. During this period, ONO played extensively in and around Chicago, both solo and alongside acts including Lydia Lunch, Cabaret Voltaire, and Naked Raygun. They performed both in music venues and non-traditional spaces such as art galleries, a wedding, and the smoldering ruins of a still-burning house. From the beginning ONO performances featured a prominent ritualistic and theatrical element. The group frequently utilized confrontational and subversive imagery, including religious and occult iconography, drag, blackface, and other symbols of racial oppression. Early audiences, many of them punks, were divided by the project, and several early performances were disrupted or canceled due to the controversy the group provoked. After early recordings were passed over by Wax Trax!, ONO began a relationship with Thermidor records which produced two albums. From 1986, the project lapsed into a period of inactivity lasting over 20 years. Group members shifted their energy toward other arts and academic projects. = Post-hiatus (2007 - present) = During their time of inactivity, awareness of the group and its work developed and their records become highly sought-after. Re-activation of the group was prompted by support from writer and musician Steve Krakow, who interviewed the group for the Chicago Reader in 2007 and featured them in his Secret History of Chicago Music column. Since their re-activation, the group has played both in the US and internationally, released five new records, and received positive attention from prominent music press including The Wire and The Recording Academy (presenters of the Grammy Awards).  Themes  ONO's work has been focused on themes of queerness, colonialism, historical trauma, and the African-American and Native American experiences. They describe themselves as \\"Exploring Gospel‚Äôs Darkest Conflicts, Tragedies and Premises\\". ONO have frequently referenced specific historical events in their work. The group's 2020 album Red Summer is themed around the Chicago race riots of 1919, and the track \\"Syphilis\\" from the album describes the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. 2014's Diegesis references the Philadelphia MOVE bombing.

Michaletz and Andrey I. Artemenkov.A first publication on TAPA was authored by V. Michaletz in 2005: V.B. Michaletz (2005). \\"Encore on discount rates in appraisal and the income approach methods\\", in Voprosi Ocenki Quarterly #1, 2005 (published by the Russian Society of Appraisers (in Russian) http://sroroo.ru/upload/iblock/059/vo1_05.pdf It provides a basis for reconstructing the Discounted cash flow analysis and the resulting income capitalization techniques, such as the Gordon growth formula (see Dividend discount model), from a transactional perspective relying, in the process, on a formulated dynamic principle of transactional equity-in-exchange. General overview TAPA approach originates with the framing of the dynamic inter- temporal principle of transactional equity-in-exchange for buyers and sellers in an asset transaction, the essence of which is that by the end of the analysis projection period n neither party should be a losing side to the transaction, meaning that the capital of the buyer and the seller bound up in the transaction should be mutually equal at the end of Period n. In TAPA, this dynamic valuation predicate forms an underlying new basis for justifying DCF analyses distinct, on the one hand, from the specific-individual-investor DCF premise developed by the American Economist Irving Fisher in his Theory of Interest 1930 book and the perfect-competitive-market-approach to justifying DCF, developed by Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani in their seminal Dividend policy and growth Paper, on the other hand. Since the Transactional approach to asset valuation, whose genesis can be traced back to Book V of Nicomachean Ethics,V.V. Galasyuk. Determination of the Fair value of object in sales, donation and barter transactions, Art Press, Dnepro 2016, pp.278 https://galasyuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-06-21-pp1-208_Ru_DEMO.pdf implies a distinct accounting for economic interests of both parties to a transaction with an economic asset, the buyer and the seller, it proceeds from developing a dual rate asset pricing model, which is complemented by a deductive-style multi-period discount rate derivation theory, originating as a generalization of the single-period discount rate framework of Burr-Williams, where the single-period discount rate, r, is conceptualized as being constituted of the current income R component and the capital value appreciation v component for a single asset or a portfolio aggregate: r=R+v. The multi-period discount rate evaluation theory within TAPA, on the other hand, is a portfolio-level theory, in that it applies to an investment aggregate. A general formula for evaluating discount rates/rates of return at a portfolio-level in TAPA looks as followsMichaletz, V. and Artemenkov, A.I.

Unlike the Capital asset pricing model(CAPM) which is built in the two-coordinates plane (\\"standard deviation(risk) -- expected (mean) return\\") relevant for pricing liquid securities traded on deep financial markets, the TAPA discount rate model is built in the \\"income growth-capital value growth\\" coordinates plane, thus it is relevant for pricing all types of income-producing assets, such as property, not just the liquid securities. Unlike single-period CAPM, TAPA is an explicit multi-period framework for forecasting market (or specific portfolio) rates of return.Michaletz V.V., Artemenkov A.I.(2018).\\"The Transactional Assets Pricing Approach and Income Capitalization Models in Professional Valuation: Towards a ‚ÄúQuick‚Äù Income Capitalization Format\\", The Real Estate Management and Valuation Journal, Vol 26.

Such a framework with time-variable discount rates is called the TAPA BPE (Basic Pricing Equation): \\\\text{TAPA's Basic Pricing Equation (BPE), with time-variable discount rates: } PV(0)= NOI \\\\cdot\\\\sum_{k=1}^n\\\\frac{\\\\quad\\\\prod_{i=2}^k (1+u_o(i))}{\\\\quad\\\\prod_{i=1}^k(1+r(i))} + PV(0) \\\\frac{\\\\quad\\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1+v_o(i))}{\\\\quad\\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1+r(i))} where, PV(0) stands for the market value of the asset being valued as at the valuation date (t=0) determined under the Income approach; r(i)-is the time-variable discount rate determined under the TAPA multi-period discount rate forecasting framework above; v_0(i) \\\\- is the expected rate of change in the capital value PV(i-1) of the asset being valued (subject asset) over the period i ,(i=1..n); u_o(i) -is the expected rate of change in the net operating income from the subject asset NOI(i-1) over period i. ( NOI =NOI(1)). The first term in the TAPA BPE formula above stands for the discounted (present) value of subject asset's benefits represented by the NOI series; while the second term‚Äîrepresents the residual (reversionary) value of the subject asset at the end of the projection/holding period n, proportioned, via the imputation of v_O(i) terms, to the asset's present value PV(0) sought at the beginning of the projection period. Thus, as can be seen, TAPA's BPE equation of value is a circular equation usually solvable by numeric methods of evaluation. The distinction of v_o(i), u_o(i) vis-a-vis v(i), u(i) variables is emphasized in TAPA. The former represent the properties of the subject asset being valued, the latter - the properties of a benchmark (a market aggregate or a portfolio) against which the valuation of subject asset is rendered.in some applications of TAPA the subject asset can be a part of the benchmark portfolio, giving rise to some interesting circularity properties in the model, and suggesting macro-economic and counter-cyclical valuation applications for TAPA, e.g. see –ú–∞–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∑–µ –ê.–ì \\"–¢–†–ê–ù–ó–ê–ö–¶–ò–û–ù–ù–´–ô –ü–û–î–•–û–î –¶–ï–ù–û–û–ë–†–ê–ó–û–í–ê–ù–ò–Ø (TAPA) –ö–ê–ö –ò–ù–°–¢–†–£–ú–ï–ù–¢ –ê–ù–ê–õ–ò–ó–ê –§–£–ù–î–ê–ú–ï–ù–¢–ê–õ–¨–ù–´–• –°–¢–û–ò–ú–û–°–¢–ï–ô? in Voproci Ocenki #2, 2019 (in Russian) https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=38548460 The discount rate r(i), being based on v(i) and u(i) variables specific to the benchmark portfolio, therefore represents the dynamic (expected performance) properties of the benchmark, not any of the properties of the subject asset being valued. Such a conceptualization of discount rates in the TAPA context emphasizes the explicit comparative nature of any income-approach-based valuation, with TAPA making such a linkage to a valuation benchmark employed explicit via the specification of discount rates in the multi-period analysis framework that it offers. The TAPA theory provides original derivations and conditions under which such BPE can be further reduced to most of the known income capitalization formats within the valuation theory, such as the direct income capitalization format (DIC), The Gordon Growth Model, the Inwood and Hoskald capitalization formats. One novel income capitalization format obtainable from the TAPA BPE is known as the \\"Quick capitalization model\\"  Dual-rate asset pricing model in TAPA Dual-rate asset pricing model developed under TAPA represents a substantial contribution of TAPA to generalizing the Discounted cash flow analysis framework. The General pricing equation for this model is as follows:Michaletz, V. and Artemenkov, A.I. (2019), \\"The transactional asset pricing approach: Its general framework and applications for property markets\\", Journal of Property Investment & Finance, Vol. 37 No. 3, pp. 255-288. https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPIF-10-2018-0078/full/htm \\\\text{TAPA dual rate asset pricing model: } PV(0)\\\\cdot\\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1+r^s(i)) = z \\\\left [ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} {NOI_k \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{i=k+1}^n (1+r^b(i))} +NOI_n +S_{res} \\\\right] where, additionally, r^b(i) and r^s(i) stand for the expected rates-of-return/discount rates utilized by the buyer (b) and seller (s) with reference to Period i, respectively, for the purposes of subject asset transactional pricing (hence, the \\"dual-rate\\" model); S_{res} \\\\- is the expected residual (reversionary) value of the subject asset at the end of its holding period n; z\\\\- is an imputed measure of dis-proportionality between the economic interests of the buyer and the seller, with the left-hand-side of the Equation reflecting economic interests of the seller, and the Right-hand side‚Äîthose of the buyer. If the residual value of the subject asset S_{res} can be assumed to be proportioned to the asset's initial value sought PV(0) via an imputation of the asset's own rates of change in capital value expected over the projection period, v_o(i), like it is assumed in the TAPA BPE context, then the presented dual-rate pricing equation becomes amenable to solutions for PV(0) e.g. by numerical methods. The dynamic principle of equity-in-exchange mentioned above implies z=1; this principle is needed to reduce the dual-rate pricing model to more conventional-looking DCF analyses and TAPA BPE shown above, along with the assumption that r^b(i)=r^s(i)=r(i), i.e. that the buyer's and seller's rates of return converge to some representative market value for such rates,r(i), called \\"the discount rate\\" in the conventional single-rate DCF applications; as mentioned, TAPA's multi- period discount rate evaluation framework summarized in the formula above allows to determine such converged market rates on a valuation benchmark (portfolio) level. Applications TAPA valuation framework is applicable to pricing assets possessing less than perfect liquidity with reference to a selected valuation benchmark for which the discount rates have to be developed, or forecast, by a valuer. In particular, the TAPA approach has found applications for pricing assets to the Equitable/Fair standard of value (valuation basis), which is defined in the International Valuation Standards published by the International Valuation Standards Council.Artemenkov A., Nandy M., Lodh S.

Among all the South American countries, Paraguay has one of the smallest number of migrants from Venezuela, with the number of documented Venezuelan migrants standing at 3,818.  History  Paraguay, a country in South America, is considered to be a transit country, since the majority of Venezuelan immigrants into Paraguay eventually migrate to Brazil, Argentina, or Uruguay. In 2013, according to official data from the Paraguay General Directorate of Migrations (DGM), the number of Venezuelans living in Paraguay has steadily increased.https://robuenosaires.iom.int/sites/default/files/publicaciones/SACM.pdf In 2017, 4,468 Venezuelans entered Paraguay. Venezuela had been experiencing a period with demonstrations, riots, attacks, and general civil unrest; during this time it was not uncommon for people to seek asylum in neighboring states. 3,779 of them left; out of the remaining 669, 192 managed to apply for permanent residency. In January, 2018, 399 Venezuelans entered Paraguay. It is estimated that an additional 300-600 people immigrated off the record. Some of those may have crossed the land border into Brazil, Argentina, or Bolivia. A the Permanent Council session, the Organization of American States (OAS) reports that between 2016 and May 2018, 4,738 Venezuelans arrived in Paraguay. However, the interim general director of Migrations, √Ångeles Arriola, said these Venezuelans do not reside in Paraguay. Paraguay is bounded by Bolivia to the northwest and north, Brazil to the northeast and east, and Argentina to the southeast, south, and west. Asunci√≥n is located on the east bank of the Paraguay River, opposite the mouth of its primary western tributary, the Pilcomayo River. The Paraguay River, which runs from north to south, divides Paraguay into two distinct geographic regions‚Äîthe Regi√≥n Oriental (Eastern Region) and the Regi√≥n Occidental (Western Region), also called the Chaco Boreal. In January 2019, The General Directorate of Migrations registered having granted temporary filings to Venezuelan citizens with 746 being permanent. It was estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 Venezuelan citizens were based in Paraguay. Food Venezuelan immigrants were perhaps initially best known for their cooking: for example, the Di Marcantonio family set up a food stall and received much media attention. They had fled their homeland due to a political, social, and economic crisis, and established a small stall where they offered typical Venezuelan dishes such as arepas and cachapas.https://www.ultimahora.com/con-la-venta-comida-tipica-venezolana- buscan-asentarse-paraguay-n1147828.html The novelty of the venture meant that in a short time the business was consolidated. Similar premises appeared in other parts of the capital, the metropolitan area, and even inland. Since 2015, \\"World Arepa Day\\" is celebrated in the emblematic Palma street on the second Saturday of September. As an icon of Asuncan history and culture, World Arepa Day is celebrated in all countries where Venezuelan communities exist. The festival displays the arepa as an iconic dish of the Cumanagoto indigenous identity and culture (inhabitants of Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela) and shows how they make the famous bread from corn. Today it is a globally recognized gastronomic festival, attracting tourists and highlighting how arepa bread interrelates with the gastronomy in the country it takes place in.

The Urdu ghazal is heavily inspired by Persian influences. The Urdu Ghazal is a literary form of the ghazal unique to South Asia. It is commonly asserted that the ghazal spread to South Asia from the influence of Sufi mystics and the Delhi Sultanate. A ghazal is composed of ashaar, which are similar to couplets, that rhyme in a pattern of AA BA CA DA EA (and so on), with each individual she'r (couplet) typically presenting a complete idea not necessarily related to the rest of the poem. They are often described as being individual pearls that make up a united necklace. Classically, the ghazal inhabits the consciousness of a passionate, desperate lover, wherein deeper reflections of life are found in the audience's awareness of what some commentators and historians call \\"The Ghazal Universe\\", which can be described as a store of characters, settings, and other tropes the genre employs to create meaning.  Craft Characteristics of an Urdu Ghazal  = She'r = A ghazal is composed of five or more ashaar (singular she'r), which are complete texts even when pulled from the rest of the ghazal. In the vast majority of ghazals, there is not logical connection or flow between ashaar in terms of content or theme. They are often described as couplets by Western audiences and critics, yet using the word \\"couplet\\" to describe a she'r is not entirely accurate, as ghazals do not have the rhyme scheme of couplets, nor are they a Western poetic form. A she'r will often contains what Agha Shahid Ali described as \\"voltas\\" or \\"turns\\" from the first misra (line) to the second, where the intention of the poet is to surprise the reader or invert expectations. The matla is the first she'r of a ghazal. In this she'r, the poet established the radif, qaafiya, and beher (meter) that the rest of the ghazal will follow. The maqta is the final she'r of a ghazal, where the poet will often include their Takhallus. These ashaar tend to be more personal by the poet referring to themselves, diverting from the ghazal's universal and self-transcendent qualities. = Beher (Meter) = Meter is considered intrinsic to the craft, with some classical poets being mocked for crafting meter incorrectly. Meter for Urdu is completely unlike meter in English poetry, as scansion of an Urdu ghazal is based upon rules in Arabic scansion. The distinction between long and short syllables is not based on vowel length, like it is in English poetry scansion. Instead, a long syllable generally contains two letters, while a short syllable generally contains one. There are many special rules that poets employ, such as the do chashmi he character, which denotes aspiration in the Nastaliq script, being metrically invisible. Metrical feet (rukn) are represented by mnemonic words called afaail, which both emulate and name the metrical foot. For example, maf'uulan denotes three long syllables in a metrical foot, while fa'lun denotes two long syllables. = Rhyme = The Urdu ghazal makes use of two main rhymes: the radif and qaafiya. The radif is a repeating refrain consisting of a single word or short phrase that ends every second line in the ghazal. However, in the matla, the first she'r of a ghazal, the radif will end both lines of the she'r. The qaafiya is a rhyming syllable that precedes the radif. In this ghazal by Mir Taqi Mir, the qaafiya is bolded and the radif is underlined: > hastƒ´ apnƒ´ habƒÅb _kƒ´ sƒ´ hai_ ye numƒÅ.ish sarƒÅb _kƒ´ sƒ´ hai_ nƒÅzukƒ´ us ke lab > kƒ´ kyƒÅ kahiye pa√±khu·∏åƒ´ ik gulƒÅb _kƒ´ sƒ´ hai_ chashm-e-dil khol is bhƒ´ aalam > par yaa√± kƒ´ auqƒÅt ·∏≥hvƒÅb _kƒ´ sƒ´ hai_ baar baar us ke dar pe jaatƒÅ huu√± hƒÅlat > ab iztirƒÅb _kƒ´ sƒ´ hai_ nuqta-e-·∏≥hƒÅl se tirƒÅ abr≈´ bait ik inti·∏≥hƒÅb _kƒ´ sƒ´ > hai_  History of the Urdu Ghazal  = Emergence of Urdu Ghazal = Literature written in Hindi-Urdu was not common prior to the 1700s. In North India, rich literary cultures existed in Awadhi and Brajbhasha, with earliest Awadhi texts dating to the 14th century. In Delhi, poets wrote in Persian, while Rekhta/Hindvi (what is now recognizable as Hindi-Urdu) did not have the same literary recognition. In the 17th century, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of Hyderabad, composed ghazal in Persian, Urdu, and Telugu. He also began a tradition of arts patronage and promoted Hyderabad as a literary city of Urdu in Southern India. Critic and Scholar Shamsur Rahman Faruqi notes that one story claims the poet Wali was one of the first to draw from the store of Persian literary culture to write ghazal in Hindi-Urdu. = Classical Period = Mushaira in Hyderabad during the 19th century. The poet Mir Taqi Mir is often lauded as ushering in a \\"Golden Age\\" of Urdu ghazal poetry in the early 18th century by mastering the blend of Persian influences with the common and idiomatic Urdu. Another classical poet, Mirza Muhammad Rafi Sauda is notable for his poetry being socially aware, and sometimes even satirical. During this era, poets made a living by attracting the financial patronage of the courts. The Oudh State gained a reputation for being one of the most generous, leading to many poets flocking to Lucknow, Farrukhabad, and Faizabad. In Delhi, the Red Fort served as both a location where mushaira were hosted, and as an institution that provided patronage to poets such as Ghalib, Zauq, Dagh, and Momin. = 1857 = The literary establishment of Delhi was split by the Indian Rebellion of 1857, as Ustad Zauq and Maulvi Muhammad Baqar supported the uprising, believing it would restore the Mughal Court to glory. Both were later hung by the British for treason. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, wrote this verse while imprisoned by the British after the uprising ended: > Sabhi jaada matam-e-sakht hai, kaho kaisi gardish-e-bakht hai Na wo taj hai > na wo takht hai na wo shah hai na dayar hai Everywhere there is the lament > and wails of mourning, how terrible is the turn of fate Neither the crown, > nor the throne, nor the emperor or the kingdom remains In the aftermath of the rebellion, the old institutions of patronage, ustads, and mushaira ended. = Modernism and the Aligarh Movement = In the late 19th century, reform movements of Urdu's literary landscape were influenced by the impacts of British colonialism. One notable leader in the modernist Islamic reform movement was Altaf Hussain Hali, who believed the ghazal to be outdated and limited in its particular rules of craft. Syed Ahmad Khan argued that Urdu literature should be remodeled after the English forms and conventions. While the classical ghazal embraced ambiguity, emotional hyperbole, and wordplay, the Aligarh Movement proposed that literature should be simple, clear, and modern. = Contemporary literary scene = One of the largest organizations dedicated to preserving the Urdu ghazal is Rekhta Foundation, which has digitized over 90,000 Urdu literary works, including ghazal. For the past five years, it has hosted the annual event Jashn-e- Rekhta. Bollywood has also adapted the Urdu ghazal for movie audience, creating a sub-genre called Filmi-ghazal. Movies such as Umrao Jaan (1981 film) and The Chess Players (film) have also portrayed the cultural decadence associated with ghazal. Women writers also began to receive recognition for writing ghazal after carving space for themselves during the 1940s in the masculine, male-dominated mushaira. Writers such as Fahmida Riaz and Kishwar Naheed have expanded the ghazal to explore feminist perspectives and speak on issues in society.  Performance  The Mushaira Jashn-e-Bahar in New Delhi, 2011. The Urdu ghazal can be sung with music in the Sufi Qawalli tradition, which is popular in South Asia. They are also commonly sung outside of Sufi shrines called Dargah. Another way to recite ghazal is tarannum, which is a mix of heightened speaking and low-key singing, often described as chanting. Ghazal are traditionally performed at Mushaira, literary events that were historically held in the Mughal Courts, but in current times can be anywhere. At a mushaira, the order of poets who read their poems is in order from novice to master. The Mushaira is also considered to be a professional workshop, where poets can improve their ghazal after seeing how the audience reacts to certain parts. A group of poets and poetry admirers is called a Mehfil.  Tropes  The Urdu ghazal makes use of a store of common characters, settings, images, and metaphors that inform both readers and poets of how to navigate the aforementioned ghazal universe. These tropes have been cultivated for hundreds of years and are meant to deeply resonate with listeners of the ghazal, invoking their expectations of meaning. Because the ghazal's ashaar are only two lines long, a reader's understanding comes not just from reading a singular she'r, but also from considering that she'r in the context of its relation to pre-established ideas in the ghazal tradition. Readers commonly navigate new she'r by comparing them to other she'r and reflecting upon similarities or divergences. = Characters = The characters of the ghazal create expectations within the audience of how the speaker and addressees of the ghazal might act. The central characters are implicated in the classic love situation of the lover pursuing the beloved, while the other secondary characters mostly add to the lover's troubles. * The Lover (Aashiq) is standard \\"narrator\\" of the ghazal who pursues their beloved (mehbooh). * The Beloved (Mehboob)is aashiq's object of desire. The gender of the mehboob is universal. * The Rival competes with the lover for attention of the beloved. * The Advisor attempts to console the lover, yet typically adds to his suffering with smug or unsympathetic advice. * The Religious Figure claims piety and righteousness yet indulges in alcohol or other sins = Settings = There are common settings wherein ghazals take place that usually shape the circumstances of the ghazal's meaning. * The Garden (bagh), where the poet often takes on the personage of the bulbul, a songbird indigenous to the Middle East and South Asia. Traditionally, this is a metaphor expressing desire for union with the divine. > Hoon garmi-i-nishat-i-tasavvur se naghma sanj Main andalib-i-gulshan-i-na > afridah hoon \\\\- Ghalib I sing from the warmth of the passionate joy of > thought I am the bulbul of a garden not yet created * The Tavern (me'khana), where a wine-bearer (saqi) invites the speaker to deeper and deeper stages of intoxication. The wine-bearer is often a teenage boy or young man who is flirtatious with the speaker. The wine does not refer to sensual intoxication, instead opening up themes of spiritual enlightenment and the Sufi concept of self-annihilation through Fana (Sufism). = Classic Images and Metaphors = The ghazal is notable for its exaggerated, far-fetched, and elevated imagery with highly figurative language. * Moth and Candle (Shama aur parvana): The moth is typically described as enraptured by the glow of the candle, circling it to the point of being incinerated. This image can used as a metaphor to present the lover's obsession with the beloved, and his willingness to destroy himself for union. * The rose (gul) and bulbul: Poets often remark on the smile of the rose, or of its relation to the season of love, where the world blooms into spring. * Arrows: In the same way an animal wounded by an arrow would run around a desert in a fit of passion, so too does the lover wander aimlessly in their obsession of the beloved. Often, the lover is described as physically wounded by the beloved's indifferent cruelty, invoking images of battle. * Medical: Poems often relate existential pain to having a medicinal cure, often invoked through the words dard or ilaaj (cure, medicical treatment). This she'r by Ghalib invokes medicinal imagery as well as the aforementioned candle: > ƒ°ham-e-hastƒ´ kƒÅ 'asad' kis se ho juz marg ilaaj sham.a har ra√±g me√± jaltƒ´ > hai sahar hote tak Asad, what can cure the grief of existence, except dying? > The candle is obliged to burn before extinguishing at dawn. * Layla and > Majnun: This classic Persian romance is often referencing in ghazal, with > the poet comparing themselves to Majnun's state of mind in the tale. In the > story, Majnun wanders the desert, where he lives an ascetic life and > composes verses declaring his love for Layla. Ghazal poets frequently use > this story as a simile or reference point to portray their love as similarly > obsessive and pure.  Themes  = Love ('ishq) = A common theme of the > ghazal is of the tortured ('ashiq) pursuing an indifferent or cruel beloved > (mehboob). The gender of both the speaker and the addressee of a ghazal can > be heterosexual, homoerotic, or fluid and indeterminate. Through this > ambiguity of personhood, the beloved is an ideal of love where deeper > reflections of life, death, and god can be expressed. Therefore, love in the > ghazal is not only that of factual human love affairs (ishq-e-mijazi), but > also of a divine union and mystical transcendence (ishq-e-haqaqi). = > Sufism = Sufi thought first entered the ghazal genre in the Persian > language before eventually entering in Urdu as well. In the ghazal, themes > of love and union with a lover simultaneously refer to union with the divine > in a mystical Islamic tradition. Love for a Sufi is the presence of God, > not the presence of physical passion. Many poets have written she'r which > parody orthodox religious puritans, as in this she'r of Ghalib: > >> What! the Waiz standing aface the tavern door!

Hook ( 1830/18311868) was an American politician who served as the first Mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, while it was still a part of the Dakota Territory with a population of around 600 people. Career Hiram M. Hook was born around 1831, in Pennsylvania. Hook served as the stage station manager in Dogtown, Nebraska, nine miles east of Fort Kearny. From 1864 to 1865, Hook and James Moore pastured cattle in a glade north of Pleasant Valley in Larimer County, Colorado Territory; the area would be later named the Hook & Moore Canyon. During this time he operated a store in Laporte with a man named French. In 1867, he moved his cattle to Cheyenne, Dakota Territory. In Cheyenne he operated a general store called the Great Western Corral. Mayor On August 7, 1867, a meeting was organized in Cheyenne for the purpose of creating a provisional municipal government. On August 9, Ed Brown, who served as the chairman of the meeting, was nominated for the town's mayoralty while another group nominated Hook. On August 10, Hook defeated Brown by five votes and the slate of Hook candidates defeated all of the Brown candidates except for E. Melanger, who was elected as city marshal. Hook served as mayor until January 30, 1868. Death Hook, Jesse Ewing, and several other silver prospectors traveled on the Green River in three boats during the summer of 1868. While navigating the river, his raft overturned due to a whirlpool and he drowned.

The film is narrated by Common, directed by filmmaker and Olympic rower Mary Mazzio, and produced by NBA athletes Grant Hill and Dwyane Wade along with 9th Wonder who also did the hip-hop score for the film. Fifty percent of the film's profits will go to rowing groups focused on diversity and inclusion efforts as well as trauma research.  Plot  A Most Beautiful Thing follows the story of the first African American public high school rowing team in the United States. Formed in the 1990s at Manley High School and based in Chicago's West Side, the team was made up of young men, many of whom were members of rival gangs. Reuniting after 20 years, the team gets back on the water to prepare to race in the 2019 Chicago Sprints, the largest rowing regatta in the Midwest. In the process, Arshay Cooper, the team's captain, takes inspiration from the past and reaches out to the Chicago Police Department to show that rowing can bring even people with the most disparate of backgrounds together. A Most Beautiful Thing features interviews with former US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Olympic coach Mike Teti, Olympic rower David Banks, and Olympic International Committee Member Anita DeFrantz.  Production and release  A Most Beautiful Thing was inspired by team captain Arshay Cooper's 2015 memoir Suga Water, which was republished June 30, 2020 by Flatiron Books under the name A Most Beautiful Thing. The film was executive produced by NBA athletes Grant Hill and Dwyane Wade along with 9th Wonder. Bill Hudson, John H. Carlson, Bill McNabb and Katie McNabb, Ginny Gilder and Lynn Slaughter, Bryan White and Christine White, Bruce Herring and Tricia Herring, Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, Ted Dintersmith, Derek Dudley, Doris Casap, Ashley Bekton, Chaz Ebert, and Rick Lane are also listed as executive producers. Originally selected as a Documentary Spotlight, A Most Beautiful Thing was set to premiere at South by Southwest on March 16, 2020 and premiere nationally with AMC Theatres March 27, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film's release was pushed back to July 31, 2020 when it opened on Xfinity. On September 1, 2020 the film will be showcased on NBCUniversal's streaming service, Peacock before being made available on Amazon Prime October 14, 2020.

Ugwu began her career as a live arts curator, writer and editor, working in the main at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) and the Live Art Development Agency (LADA) with Lois Keidan. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  Career  = Live arts = Ugwu first became involved in the area of performance and related practice in 1986, working freelance with a range of arts organisations and companies, including the Albany Empire Theatre, the Cheek by Jowl theatre company, the Black Theatre Co-operative, Chisenhale Dance Space, the National Review of Live Art (NRLA), and the Islington International Festival. She joined the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in 1991, working with Lois Keidan as Deputy Director of Live Arts, and holding programming, curatorial, and commissioning responsibilities. The platform they created at the ICA is considered to have contributed to the growth of live art (as an artistic practice distinct from theatre or visual arts) in London and the UK during the 1990s. In a 1994 article contributed by Bernardine Evaristo to the black arts listings magazine Artrage, Ugwu described live art as \\"a way of examining cultural and ethnic identity and its effectiveness as a means of constructing and deconstructing identities and representations of ourselves\\". While at the ICA, Ugwu compiled and edited a book of artworks and essays titled Let's Get It On: The Politics of Black Performance that included contributions by bell hooks and Paul Gilroy, and an essay of her own. It was ‚Äúthe first book to offer detailed analysis of black live art in Britain‚Äù and, as a ‚Äúresponse to the absence of black live art history‚Äù, the publication has been described as a ‚Äúlandmark collection‚Äù, and \\"path-breaking\\". It received an Honourable Mention from the Arnold Rubin Outstanding Publication Award Committee of the Arts Council of the African Studies Association (ACASA) in 1998. As a writer, Ugwu also contributed to the Iniva/ICA exhibition catalogue Mirage: Enigmas of Race, Difference and Desire on the work of Frantz Fanon, and the Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture. In 1997, Ugwu and Keidan left the ICA to form Keidan/Ugwu, ‚Äúa company dedicated to locating time-based performance within a critical framework, but outside the institutional context‚Äù. In 1999, Ugwu co-founded the Live Art Development Agency (LADA) with Keidan, serving as co-director until 2000. LADA has been described as ‚Äúthe most significant catalyst for the development of the Live Art sector in London and the UK more widely‚Äù. Ugwu and Keidan also worked as curators and consultants at international festivals around the world, including the 1999 Festival De Beweeging in Antwerp. Artists that Ugwu and Keidan collaborated with, both at the ICA and independently, include Forced Entertainment, La Ribot, Marina Abramoviƒá, ORLAN, Stelarc, Ron Athey, Ron Vawter, and Guillermo G√≥mez-Pe√±a. Ugwu was also a combined arts, dance and drama advisor for Arts Council England and the London Arts Board, chaired the boards of the intercultural arts organisation Motiroti (1996-1998), The Showroom gallery (1996-2000), and the Talawa Theatre Company (1998-2000), and contributed to UK and international conferences on issues of cultural diversity and live arts practice. = Ceremonies and events = Ugwu produced the Millennium Dome Opening Ceremony, held on 31 December 1999. In 2000, she left her position as co-director of the Live Art Development Agency to work as an independent producer on large-scale international events, and was a producer of the Manchester Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony in 2002. A Senior Producer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2006 Doha Asian Games, and for the strategic phase of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Opening, Victory, and Closing Ceremonies, Ugwu went on to work as Executive Producer of the Glasgow Handover Ceremony at the Closing Ceremony of the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games. 247x247pxIn 2010, Ugwu was appointed Executive Producer ‚Äì Production of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Ceremonies, alongside Stephen Daldry (Executive Producer ‚Äì Creative) and Danny Boyle (Artistic Director of the Olympic Opening Ceremony). The Olympic Opening Ceremony was widely praised by the media: The Times described it as ‚Äúa masterpiece‚Äù, while The Daily Telegraph called it ‚Äúbrilliant, breathtaking, bonkers and utterly British‚Äù. Ugwu was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for her work on London 2012. Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the writer of the Opening Ceremony, revealed that the London 2012 cauldron designed by Thomas Heatherwick was codenamed ‚ÄúBetty‚Äù after Ugwu's dog, in order to maintain secrecy. A portrait of Ugwu with her dog Betty, taken by the photographer Jillian Edelstein, was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery, London for its ‚ÄúRoad to 2012: Aiming High‚Äù exhibition and primary collection. In 2013, Ugwu founded her own production company, Betty Productions.

She wrote numerous books and was a contributor to publications including The Century Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Women's Home Companion, and Ladies Home Journal. Her books Slippy McGee and A Woman Named Smith are part of the Library of Congress Collection and have been digitized. Three films have been adapted from her novels. Early life Born Marie Conway in Savannah, Georgia on May 29, 1879, she was the daughter of Helena Browne Conway and Richard Hoban Conway. Her maternal grandmother was born in Tipperary, Ireland and taught her about Irish folklore and fairy tales throughout her childhood. Her paternal grandfather was an amateur naturalist. As a child, she lived with him in Florida, which is where she first met a Red Admiral, a butterfly that had an important role in her book The Purple Heights. Career Oemler's first works were poetry and short stories, published in magazines from 1907 to 1917. Her first book, Slippy McGee, was published in 1917 and had slow sales at first. However, it had repeated printings and became Oemler's most popular novel. In 1919, Oemler's novel A Woman Named Smith was published. The book focused on a love story set in a haunted house in the South. Her next novel, The Purple Heights (1920), became a bestseller. She wrote the 1927 novel The Holy Lover focusing on John Wesley, an 18th century English religious leader. A historical novel, this work deviated from the popular fiction she created during most of her career, and stood alone as her most serious work. Most of her novels were written to appeal to wider audiences, using sensationalist adventure, romance, and suspense in her plots. Her book Where the Young Child Was is a collection of Christmas themed stories. Personal life She married John Norton Oemler in 1901 and had two children, a boy and a girl‚ÄîAlan Norton Oemler and Elizabeth Heyward Oemler, respectively.

It is also called as ‡§ã‡§∑‡§≠. More information and importance of Risabha The following is the information about Risabha and its importance in Indian classical music: * Risabha is the second svara in an octave or Saptak. * Re is the immediate next svara of Sadja (Sa). * The svara of Risabha is Komal and Shuddha. * It is said that Sadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Sadja then we get, Shad And Ja. It means that Shad is 6 and ja is 'giving birth' in Marathi.https://saxonianfolkways.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-7-shadows-of- shadja So basically the translation is : ‡§∑‡§°‡•ç - 6, ‡§ú -‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ . Therefore, it collectively means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music. So the svara Re is formed from Sadja. * The frequency of Risabha is 270 Hz. The frequencies of the 7 svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) ........ (and so on). Consequently, the Re after the Sa of 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) has a frequency of 540 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Re. * There are 3 Shruti's of Risabha. Previously the main Shruti, not only for Re but for all the other svaras, was on the last Shruti but now it is considered to be on the 1st Shrurti. For example, if these are the 3 Shruti's of Re then, Previously this was the position of the main Shruti of Re. ^ 1 2 3 ^ But now this position has become the main Shruti of Re. * All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras , since these svaras don't move from their original position. Svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Shuddha Svaras Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras Ma - Tivra Svaras * Ragas from Bhairav Thaat, Poorvi Thaat, Marwa Thaat, Bhairavi Thaat and Todi Thaat have Komal Risabha. * Ragas where Re is the Vadi svara - Raga Brindabani Sarang, etc. Ragas where Re is the Samvadi svara - Raga Bhairav, etc. * Hypothetically speaking, Re is said to be the Rishimuni, Rishimuni as in, the three main gods, Bhrama, Vishnu and Shiva were first created i.e. Sakar Bhrama (Sa) and then these three gods created Rishimuni i.e. Re. Re is made the acronym of Rishimuni for showing the importance of the syllable Re.https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-significance- of-Seven-Sur-Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa-Dha-Ni-Sa-in-music * Risabha is said to be sourced from the lowing of a bull.https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara- and-shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIShttps://www.dollsofindia.com/library/raga_ragini/ * Risabha is associated with the planet Mars. https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIS * Risabha is associated with Red colour. https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIS Difference in pronouncing In the introductory part of Risabha it is given that, 'Risabha is the long form of the syllables ‡§∞‡•á and ‡§∞‡•Ä. For simplicity in pronouncing while singing the syllable, Risabha is pronounced as Re and Ri'. This given because the pronouncing of the syllable Re is different in the Hindustani classical music and Carnatic classical music. In Hindustani classical music, the pronouncing of Risabha is done as Re and in Carnatic classical music, the pronouncing of Risabha is done as Ri. So a Hindustani classical singer will sing the 7 svaras as : Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa. While a Carnatic classical singer will sing these svaras like : Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa.

The club's address is 65 Cromarty Street, Sydney. Cromarty Tennis Club is a member of Tennis Nova Scotia. Programs offered by the club include junior and senior (adult) lessons, team tennis, competitive ladder, junior ladder, club mixers and socials as well as the Cape Breton Junior Regionals, Masters Championships, and the Cape Breton Open tournaments. There are both organized and unorganized playing schedules with the club operating from mid-May to late November each year. The club has between 150 and 200 members, 100 of whom are children. The club also offers up to three youth summer tennis camps each season. Facilities =Courts= There are 4 hard surfaced courts (synthetic/acrylic over asphalt). All courts are lit for evening play. The courts were completely rebuilt and resurfaced in 1996, and resurfaced again in 2002, 2006 and 2011. =Clubhouse= There is a Clubhouse with a lounge, washrooms, and an outdoor deck overlooking the courts. Cape Breton Open The Cape Breton Open tennis championships was hosted by the Cromarty Tennis Club in 1936, 1940, 1941, 1942, and after pausing for the remainder of World War II, again in 1947, and 1949, as well as hosting the Nova Scotia Open (the Provincial tennis championship), that same year. The Cape Breton Open has been held by Cromarty each year annually thereafter. The Open attracts some of the top tennis players from across the province, drawing 50 to 75 players in open division (men' and women's open singles, open double, and mixed doubles), man's singles over-35, over-45, over-55, and over-65, women's singles over-35, and mn's and women's doubles over-35 Masters divisions. History The first Cromarty Clubhouse, ca. 1908 The Sydney Lawn Tennis Club was incorporated by an Act of the Nova Scotia Legislature on 28 April 1893. The Club was founded by five gentlemen. A few years later, the Sydney Lawn Tennis Club decided to purchase about an acre of land at Sherwood, part of the Dr. McLeod estate on Reservoir Brook in Sydney. They believed this would provide enough land to construct five tennis courts, a bowling green, handball courts, and quiet grounds. The price was to be about $2,500. On the evening of 24 April 1902, a meeting of subscribers to the Tennis Association were held at the offices of Burchell & McIntyre in Sydney. By June 1902 two courts had been completed and were in use every evening by the players. The remaining courts were to be completed as soon as the weather would permit. A formal opening of the Lawn Tennis grounds at Cromarty took place on Saturday afternoon, 19 July 1902 and was largely attended. [Sydney Daily Post, July 21, 1902] The Sydney Lawn Tennis Club's Annual Tournament, held on the club's new grounds at Cromarty Street, commenced on 5 August 1902. The following year, An Act to incorporate the Sydney Tennis Association, Limited was passed on the 11th day of April, A.D., 1903. Five members were named in the Act's introduction. That same year the third annual Nova Scotia Lawn Tennis Association Annual Tournament was held on the grounds of the Sydney Tennis Club. A break in a tennis match at the Sydney Lawn Tennis Courts (now Cromarty Tennis Club), dated late 1920s. The first club house was built by 1905. The association transferred title of the property to the Kinsmen in 1958. The ownership of the property was transferred to the City of Sydney (now the Cape Breton Regional Municipality - CBRM) on 1 January 1963, and the club has since that time been operated by the Cromarty Tennis Club Society (Incorporated 22 May 1980), and its predecessors. The CBRM gives the club a $5,000 annual operating grant.

On the American side, the crossing was connected by US Highway 75 (US 75) in Kittson County, while the Canadian side was connected by Provincial Trunk Highway 75 (PTH 75) in the Town of Emerson (now the Municipality of Emerson ‚Äì Franklin). During the early and mid-20th century, it was one of the busiest road and rail border crossings west of the Great Lakes. The road crossing has been closed since 2006; all cross-border traffic is now diverted to the nearby Pembina‚ÄìEmerson Border Crossing. History The first border station in the region was constructed in 1871 at West Lynne, Manitoba (now part of Emerson) on the west side of the Red River of the North. With the rise in popularity of automobile travel and the construction of the Jefferson Highway, which crossed into Canada at Noyes, the United States opened a border station on the east side of the river in the 1910s. The new crossing quickly became one of the busiest along the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In 1931, the US constructed a large new station and rerouted US 75 to replace the Jefferson Highway. The US Inspection Station at Noyes, one of the first purpose-built border stations in North America, still stands today and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. For many years, the town of Emerson, Manitoba had two border crossings: one on the west side of the Red River opposite Pembina, North Dakota (US Highway 81) and the one on the east side opposite Noyes (US 75). On the Canadian side, both crossings were served by a single customs building located in downtown Emerson. Separate stations were built in the mid-1950s: the station opposite Pembina was called \\"West Lynne\\" while the larger station opposite Noyes was known as \\"Emerson East\\". In 1949, the Manitoba government realigned PTH 75 (formerly designated as PTH 14) to connect with US 75\\\\. A short road was built to connect to the Pembina‚ÄìWest Lynne Border Crossing on the west side of the river. Noyes-Emerson East remained the primary of the two border crossings into the 1960s and 70s; however, this changed after Interstate 29 (I-29) replaced US 81 and new, larger border stations were constructed by both countries at Pembina and West Lynne. Traffic at the Noyes‚ÄìEmerson East crossing decreased substantially as most vehicles diverted to the new Interstate highway and new facilities at Pembina‚ÄìWest Lynne. In 1985, the Manitoba government realigned PTH 75 at Emerson to divert through traffic to Pembina‚ÄìWest Lynne via PTH 29. =Closure= Although the Noyes‚ÄìEmerson East ports of entry were still moderately used in the early 2000s, mainly by local residents, the Canadian government closed its border station as a cost-saving measure in 2003 and merged remaining operations with West Lynne (since renamed \\"Emerson\\"). The former border station was demolished in 2004 and the property later divested by the Canadian government. Only US-bound traffic was permitted until 2006, when the US closed its port of entry and the road between the former border stations was permanently barricaded. United States Customs and Border Protection continued to occupy the Noyes border station until 2011. The border station and property were later put up for sale. Today, all cross-border traffic wishing to continue on PTH 75 in Manitoba or US 75 in Minnesota must detour through the Pembina‚ÄìEmerson (West Lynne) ports of entry. US 75 meets a dead end at Noyes, and PTH 75 has been realigned to connect with I-29. The Lancaster‚ÄìTolstoi Border Crossing is now the westernmost border crossing between Minnesota and Manitoba. The adjacent rail crossing and inspection facilities remain in operation and are managed by the Pembina and Emerson ports of entry. Illegal immigration The border crossing's location and remaining infrastructure have made it a common site for illegal border crossing. The former port began to see an increase in illegal crossings into Canada following Executive Order 13769 from US President Donald Trump in 2017. The increased levels of asylum seekers trying to enter Canada at the current Pembina‚ÄìEmerson and former Noyes‚ÄìEmerson border crossings and other regions along the border have garnered international media attention, resulting in the Canadian government renegotiating the Safe Third Country Agreement with the US government. The practice of crossing the border illegally can be dangerous. A 57-year old Ghanaian asylum seeker died of hypothermia while attempting to cross into Canada from Noyes in May 2017.

Anthusa's feast days in the Orthodox Church are 12 and 18 April, while her feast in the Catholic Church is 27 July. In the Catholic Church, Anthusa is patroness of convents and abbeys. She was the daughter of Byzantine Emperor Constantine V.  Life  = Childhood = During a campaign in Paphlagonia, Emperor Constantine V summoned the abbess Anthusa of Mantinea (Saint Anthousa the Elder), who he had tortured earlier for worshipping icons, and asked for her prayers due to the difficulty of the empress' pregnancy. The abbess predicted the birth of twins, and the daughter was named in her honor. Anthusa of Constantinople was the daughter of the iconoclast Byzantine Emperor Constantine V and one of his wives. Details about her Anthusa's birth are uncertain. According to one source, she and her brother, the future Emperor Leo the Khazar, were twins born on 25 January 750 to Constantine's first wife (i.e. Tzitzak), while another states that she was born in 757, a date which would make Eudokia her mother and rule out the possibility of being a twin, given that it is known for certain that Leo was born on the former date.Grierson, Philip (2001).

However, Anthusa declined the offer. At court, she wore clothes befitting her position as the late emperor's daughter, but underneath her elaborate clothes, she wore a hair-shirt. Anthusa entered the monastery of Saint Euthymia. She was later tonsured by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, and she founded the Omonoia Monastery (\\"omonoia\\" means 'concord' or 'charity') in Constantinople, which became known for its strict regulations. = Death = According to one source, Anthusa lived to the age of fifty-two, and died in 801 AD.

The state formed as a series of small island arcs, deep ocean sediments and mafic oceanic crust were accreted to the western edge of North America, producing a series of deep basins and high mountain ranges. One of the most important events was the advent of the San Andreas Fault around 29 million years ago in the Oligocene when the region subducted a spreading center in the East Pacific Rise. This produced major crustal stretching, volcanism and displacement of up to 125 miles. Geological history The oldest rocks in California date back 1.8 billion years to the Proterozoic and are found in the San Gabriel Mountains, San Bernardino Mountains, and Mojave Desert. The rocks of eastern California formed a shallow continental shelf, with massive deposition of limestone during the Paleozoic, and sediments from this time are common in the Sierra Nevadas, Klamath Mountains and eastern Transverse Range. Active subduction began in the Triassic during the Mesozoic, producing large granite intrusions and the beginning of the Nevadan Orogeny as well as more dryland conditions and the retreat of the ocean to the west. Throughout the Jurassic the Nevadan Orogeny accelerated with large-scale granitic intrusions and erosion into deep marine basins. These basins steadily filled with sediment, with one famous example preserved as the Great Valley beds in the Coast Ranges. Simultaneously island arcs and small sections of continental crust rafted onto the edge of North America, building out the continent. During the Cenozoic, the volcanic and deep water sedimentary Franciscan rocks were accreted to the edge of California and vast areas of marine sedimentary rocks deposited in the Central Valley and what would become the Transverse and Coast Ranges. Examples of filled basins included the Los Angeles Basin, the Eel River Basin around Eureka or the 50,000 foot thick sedimentary sequences of the Ventura Basin. The San Andreas Fault became perhaps most active after the Miocene, potentially resulting in up to 350 miles of offset in some locations. Regional geology =California Coast Ranges= The California Coast Ranges extend from the Oregon line southward 600 miles to the Santa Ynez River. The mountains are drained by the Russian, Eel, Mad and Klamath rivers which tend to follow faults and folds. Per square mile of drainage, the Eel River has the highest suspended sediment load of any river in the US, exceeding the Colorado River and Mississippi River. The Franciscan subduction complex makes up the basement rock for part of the range, with a m√©lange dominated by grayacke first deposited in offshore deep ocean basins. These rocks are rich in plagioclase, quartz and chlorite mica (which gives them a greenish color) and range up to 25,000 feet thick. In some places they are interbedded with shale, limestone and radiolarian chert. Examples of rock formations in the Franciscan subduction complex include the Calera limestone east of the San Andreas fault or the Laytonville limestone which extends north of San Francisco to Eureka. Franciscan rocks have a complex geological structure. In some places, ophiolite sequences preserve remnant oceanic crust rock on land, while other parts of the range are intruded with ultrabasic igneous rocks that have serpentinized to peridotite. In the southern part of the range, between the Nacimiento and San Andreas fault zones, the metamorphic rocks and granite plutons of the Salinian block make up the basement rock. These rocks were likely moved to their current location by the two major faults. Some Great Valley rocks are exposed in the Coastal Ranges as well, like the Jurassic Knoxville Formation shale. Sur Series schist, quartzite, marble, gneiss and granulite in the Salinian block likely deposited in a marine shelf late in the Paleozoic. Shelf and slope deposits would ultimately become Great Valley rocks, while the trench deposits became the Franciscan subduction complex. Major geologic changes began in the Cenozoic with continued continental shelf deposition of shale, sandstone and clay as well as near-shore tropical coal deposits. During the Miocene, the Coast Ranges were flooded again, with underwater volcanic eruptions in the southern part of the range and deposition of fossil-rich shales like the Monterey formation. Uplift took place into the Pliocene and Pleistocene, slowly reducing sea levels inland in the Central Valley. The Coast Range is at even higher risk for damaging landslides than other parts of coastal California due to sheared serpentinite in Franciscan basement rocks. =Central Valley= The Central Valley includes the southern San Joaquin Valley and the northern Sacramento Valley. The Great Valley Sequence is a 40,000 foot thick formation at the western edge of the Central Valley that formed between the Jurassic and Cretaceous, overlying the Franciscan Assemblage and granite rocks associated with the Sierra Nevadas to the east. It represents an ancient forearc basin that took shape as oceanic crust subducted under the west edge of the continent. During the Jurassic, many sediments shed into the region from the rising proto-Sierra Nevada mountains. For much of the Cenozoic the region was filled with lakes and brackish swamps. Thick Miocene sediments formed in narrow seaways from the Pacific. The Stockton fault and White Wolf fault by Bakersfield are both major tectonic features. The 7.6 magnitude 1952 Kern County earthquake was one of the most powerful in California in the 20th century. The subsurface is well known from oil wells and oil fields are bounded in the east by the Kern Front fault. A small andesitic dome near Marysville is the only example of volcanic rocks in the valley exposed near the surface. =Coronado Island= The distinctive Coronado Island in San Diego County helps to create the large sheltered harbor of San Diego. It formed as a sandspit filled in to the north from sediment deposited by the Tijuana River and sheltered from wind and waves by the Cretaceous uplands of Point Loma. Two small islands to the north: North Island and South Island have been connected with fill to create the Naval Air Station. Without continuous dredging, San Diego Bay would fill with sediment and become dry land with deposition from the San Diego, Sweetwater and Otay rivers. =Klamath Mountains= The Klamath Mountains formed as small island arc terranes accreted against the coast of North America before and during the Devonian and overlain by newer rocks, deposited from the Cretaceous to modern times. Geologists have subdivided the four terranes in the mountain range, referring to them as \\"plates.\\" The Klamath Mountains have several areas of preserved oceanic crust. The Josephine ophiolite forms the basement of the western Klamath Mountains, with extensive peridotite from the boundary between the oceanic crust and the mantle, as well as chromite and nickel deposits. It is exposed in the Smith River drainage to the north of US Highway 199 in Del Norte County. By contrast, the Trinity ophiolite is found in the east, known for its numerous ultramafic rocks and being one of the most extensive ophiolites in the US. The Western Jurassic Plate stretches for 220 miles on the western edge of the mountains. The thick Galice formation slate and metamorphosed greywacke overlie the Jospehine ophiolite and likely deposited in a deep ocean environment offshore of the island arc. It also interfingers with up 23,000 feet of volcanic rocks in the Rogue Formation. Some rocks in the Western Jurassic Plate seem to have been subducted, reaching blueschist grade metamorphism in the sequence of metamorphic facies in the South Fork Mountain schist. By contrast, the Eastern Klamath Plate is made up of limestone, chert and pyrocastic rocks, divided in half by the Trinity Ophiolite. A thrust fault, known as the Trinity or Bully Choop thrust, separates the Eastern Klamath Plate from the Central Metamorphic Plate. This region of the mountains was likely underthrusted by the adjoining plates, producing multiple schists around 380 to 400 million years ago in the Ordovician. Many of these schists, like the Condrey Mountain schist are more resistant to erosion than other rocks close by. The Western Paleozoic and Triassic Plate is the most common unit of the Klamath Mountains and is up to 50 miles wide at the Oregon state line. Geologists have struggled to define its structural geology with complex sequences of deep ocean crust, upper mantle rock and tectonic melanges. Granite plutons emplaced during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, forming rock units like the Ironside Mountain diorite, which outcrops for 37 miles from the Orleans Mountain lookout tower to the line between Humboldt County and Siskiyou County or the Shasta Bally batholith at Buckhorn Summit west of Redding. A few may date earlier, like the 400 million year old Mule Mountain. During the Pleistocene, the mountains had a large number of glaciers and cirques and glacially-carved U-shaped valleys are remaining features from that time period. Large boulders have often eroded out of moraine deposits, coming to rest a few miles away. Fast flowing rivers meant that the region has accumulated very little alluvium, except for a rare 400 foot thick deposit in Scott Valley, southwest of Yreka, California. =Modoc Plateau= The Modoc Plateau is an undulating expanse of Miocene to Holocene basalt law flows at the southwest edge of the Columbia Plateau, covering 10,000 square miles. It is drained by the Pit River, which ultimately reaches Shasta Lake and the Sacramento River. The Warner Basalt is the most common rock in the plateau, bordered by the Surprise Valley fault zone that first became active in the Miocene 15 million years ago. Based on faulting in recent alluvial material, the Surprise Valley fault zone is still active. In spite of low rainfall, the numerous lava tubes and volcanic fractures in the plateau produce the Fall River Springs, one of the largest springs in the US. At least 300 lava tubes are known in Lava Beds National Monument, some of which preserve ice year round. The rugged terrain of the Modoc Plateau played an important role in the Modoc War. In 1873, 53 Modoc men held off 650 US troops, killing 70 of them in heavy weather in the lava plateau to the south of Tule Lake. The Modoc exploited collapse pits and lava tunnels, turning to Tule Lake for food (subsequent drainage has reduced the lake shoreline). =Mojave Desert= The Mojave Desert extends into areas of Basin and Range terrain and includes some of the oldest rocks exposed at the surface in California. The movement of the San Andreas Fault and Garlock Fault helped to induce arid conditions during the Cenozoic. Unlike most of California, the Mojave region has numerous Precambrian Proterozoic rocks, such as granitic gneiss or marble intruded with porphyry in the Ord Mountains or schist in the Old Woman Mountains. The Marble Mountain Cambrian quartzite lies unconformably atop Proterozoic granites. During the Jurassic high sea levels retreated, switching to the deposition of the terrestrial Aztec sandstone. Volcanic rocks erupted around Barstow in the Triassic. Lake beds interbedded with volcanic ash are typical of the Cenozoic. Volcanism continued through the Holocene, forming the 300 foot thick basalts of the Cima Volcanic Field or the Barstow- Amboy axis of volcanic craters, which have protected underlying granite from erosion. Unique geology in the region formed bastnaesite mined at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine. Additionally, borate deposited during arid conditions, with mining after 1926. =Newport Bay= At the edge of the Los Angeles coastal plain and just west of the San Joaquin Hills, Newport Bay is a major hub of boating. Geologists have interpreted the bay as the drowned channel of the Santa Ana River. Flow in and out of the estuary has been controlled with a man-made structure since heavy silting in 1915. Virtually all of the islands in the bay are man-made from dredged sediments. However, a bulge in the bay's sand spit records offshore presence of the Newport submarine canyon. In the 19th century, a railroad pier was built out into the canyon to avoid waves closer in to shore when loading and unloading ships. =Peninsular Ranges= The Peninsular Ranges are a group of mountain ranges that extend 125 miles (200 km) from the Los Angeles and Transverse Ranges southward the entire length of Baja California. The eastern ranges, including the Santa Rosa Mountains are typically over 6000 feet high (1800 m) with San Jacinto Peak reaching 10,805 feet, whereas the western ranges like the Santa Ana Mountains, Agua Tibia and Laguna are lower. Like the Sierra Nevadas, the Peninsular Ranges have gentle western slopes and steep eastern faces. The mountains are drained by the Santa Margarita, San Luis Rey, San Diego and San Dieguito rivers, while San Felipe Creek in the east drains into the Salton Sea. The oldest \\"roof\\" rocks in the Peninsular Ranges date to the Paleozoic, such as limestone deposits near Riverside quarried for the concrete industry. The oldest rocks are found in the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains, with schist and gneiss that may be up to 22,000 feet thick. With the exception of some metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, most rocks in the Peninsular Ranges are igneous and Jurassic in age, dating to the time of the Nevadan orogeny. Most intrusive igneous rocks are tonalite, granodiorite, quartz diorite or gabbro. Geologists group the plutons of the Peninsular Ranges as the Southern California batholith, which includes several large individual plutons like the San Marcos Gabbro, Woodson Mountain Granodiorite or Bonsall Tonalite. Compared with the Sierra Nevadas, rocks from this time period tend be more calic than silicic. The rocks likely formed much further away from the Sierras and were relocated by the dramatic movements of faults. A thick sequence of mostly terrestrial sedimentary rocks including the Rosario, Ladd, Trabuco and Williams formations is exposed on the western slope of the Santa Ana Mountains and Santa Ana Canyon, stretching southward to Camp Pendleton, San Onofre, and smaller exposures in Encinitas, Leucadia, Point Loma and La Jolla. These rocks date to the Cretaceous, with a lower sequence of conglomerate overlain by sandstone and shale, with huge ammonite fossils. In the early Cenozoic, widespread erosion of crystalline rocks inland produced huge quantities of sediment which deposited on the Cretaceous rocks of the Peninsular Ranges. Examples include the Silverado Formation with 1400 feet of Paleocene terrestrial sedimentary rock in the Santa Anas or the Eocene Poway Formation near San Diego. The Poway Formation has rounded metavolcanic pebbles with no known source nearby, suggesting an original source somewhere in Sonora before a major offset to the north by faults. Much more recent Pliocene terrestrial sedimentary rocks are also common in the northern Peninsular Ranges like the San Timoteo Canyon and Mount Eden conglomerate, sandstone and siltstone which are up to 7000 feet thick. Fossils are common in the marine rocks of the Pacific Beach and Mission Bay formation around San Diego. The Peninsular Ranges were never glaciated during the Pleistocene. In the nineteenth century, mining began in the vicinity of Julian, extracting nickel and gold, in the Julian Schist. Hot springs including San Jacinto, Eden, Saboba and Gilman are active in the San Jacinto Mountains due to the presence of the San Jacinto fault zone and Elsinore was founded on its hot springs. =San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay= The three interconnected Suisun, San Pablo and San Francisco bays occupy a structural depression dating to the Pliocene which flooded several times due to Pleistocene glaciations. Below the bays, is the Merced Formation, with 45000 feet of marine rocks overlain by 500 feet of terrestrial sedimentary rocks and capped with more modern sediments from the Sacramento River. With much of the bays only 30 feet deep, human activity has accelerated erosion and filling due to historical hydraulic mining and farming. The bay system was the second place in the US to be mapped in 1826 by Edward Belcher and Alex Collie, a surveyor and surgeon respectively on the British vessel HMS Blossom. =Sierra Nevada Mountains= The basement rocks of the Sierra Nevadas date to the Paleozoic and include rocks in the Shoo Fly complex and Grizzly Formation. These deposited as part of a series of small island arcs, \\"rafted\\" against the coast of the proto- North American continent Laurentia. Based on the presence of flat-topped guyot undersea volcanoes with geology similar to the bedded cherts and pillow lavas of the In the Shoo Fly complex, the Bullpen Lake sequence has bedded cherts and cooled pillow lava that closely resembles rocks found on flat-topped offshore volcanic guyots, suggesting a deep-sea origin for the base of the Sierras sometime before the Devonian. In the Triassic, the Paleozoic rocks of the Calaveras complex were heaved under the Shoo Fly complex by the Sonoma orogeny, which is preserved in roof pendants and country rock inclusions. During the Nevadan orogeny in the Jurassic, extensive folding and faulting altered the rocks and huge granite batholiths erupted. The Foothill Metamorphic Belt likely came ashore as an island arc terrane, colliding with the edge of North America to the west of the current Melones fault zone. This added metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks to the slowly building Sierras. Geologists debate how high the early Sierra Nevadas were. Twenty-five thousand feet of Jurassic marine sediments in the Sacramento Valley do not necessarily correspond exactly to the height of the mountains, but fist-sized cobbles in conglomerates from the Cretaceous suggest steep conditions and potentially higher altitudes than today. Most erosion of the Sierra Nevadas was finished by the Eocene and faulting may have reactivated the roots of the mountains to create the current mountain range. The geomorphology of the Sierra Nevadas is comparatively recent, dating to as recently as the Quaternary. Movement along the Sierra Nevada fault helped to create the new Muir Crest and parts of the mountain range rose up to 10,000 feet over the last three million years, creating a steep face to the west of Owens Valley. North of the San Joaquin River, the mountains have a tilted-block pattern caused the Sierra Nevada fault, which is interpreted as being similar to the more common Basin and Range terrain to the east. However, the Greenhorn Fault system is more active to the south, extending to the Tehachapi Mountains and causing more plateau- like landforms. Volcanic eruptions in the Miocene between 9.5 and 3.5 million years ago filled old eroded canyons in parts of the Sierras with lava flows. The Kern River and San Joaquin River both run in valleys \\"refilled\\" with lava. Rhyolite volcanic ash buried other streams during the Oligocene forming tuff that early miners need to dig through to get at placer gold, and many old buildings in the region are made of blocks of tuff. =Transverse Ranges= The Transverse Ranges extend from Point Arguello to Joshua Tree National Park, bounded by the San Andreas Fault to the north. It is the only coastal mountain range in the US‚Äîand potentially North America‚Äîwith rocks older than the Phanerozoic. The Santa Ynez Mountains extend up the coast of Santa Barbara County and contain Franciscan basement rocks (also referred to as the Franciscan basement complex) like the Coast Ranges. These are Jurassic and Cretaceous age greywacke, chert, basalt, ultrabasic rocks and serpentinite from modified oceanic crust. Subsequently, sandstone and shale deposited while the region was still underwater. Up to 10,000 feet of sandstone and red shale deposited during the Eocene, after which sea levels dropped in the Oligocene preserved the sand, gravel and silt of the Sespe Formation. Before the end of the Oligocene, sea levels rose again leaving behind the Vaqueros Formation and then the Miocene deep water silt and clay of the Rincon Formation. As deep basins up to one mile deep formed in the Miocene and filled with thick sediments, volcanic eruptions related to the San Andreas Fault led to rhyolite and basalt eruptions. All of these rocks were uplifted in the Pleistocene at the same time as the Coast Range orogeny, formed an anticlinal arch or tilted block against the Santa Ynez fault in the north. Because the mountain range is young only a very narrow coastal plain has developed around Santa Barbara. Similar rock formations and patterns are found throughout Ventura County, in the Topatopa Mountains and Pine Mountains. Thick Pliocene marine rocks up to 14,000 feet thick are found on the edges of the Santa Clara River Valley and parts of the San Fernando Valley, stretching to Fillmore. Major uplift was going on in Pleistocene, with some marine terraces raised 1000 feet. The Santa Monica Mountains and the Channel Islands are different than the mountains to the north because they have granitic and metamorphic basement rocks more like the Sierra Nevadas. The oldest rock in this part of the range is the Santa Monica Slate. Thick sequences of marine rocks from the Late Cretaceous through the Paleocene and Eocene are common in the mountains and on San Miguel Island. During the Miocene, a deep marine channel filled with up to 15,000 feet of sediment which is most of the rock exposed on the Channel Islands. Pillow structures from rapid cooling water indicate underwater volcanism that produced basalt, andesite and diabase flows during the Miocene. In fact volcanic rocks are 10,000 feet thick in the western part of the Santa Monica Mountains. The San Onofre Breccia also formed during this period with distinct glaucophane schist, gabbro, limestone and greenschist. The Transverse Ranges are poorly drained by streams, but subject to periodic intense flooding, typically every 20 to 25 years. In 1815, the Los Angeles River, which then drained to Long Beach, flooded so substantially that it changed course, joining Ballona Creek and flowing to Santa Monica Bay, before another flood in 1825 redirected it back to Long Beach. Serious flooding in 1862 created a three mile wide lake in the Santa Ana River, while serious flooding in 1938 inundated the San Fernando Valley and parts of the Los Angeles coastal plain, damaging 100 bridges and killing 43 people. Natural resource geology =Gold mining in the Sierra Nevadas= Most of the gold historically mined in California originated in the Mother Lode belt, located in the foothills of the western Sierras. Most of the gold deposits date to the Cretaceous and formed in narrow belt around the Melones fault in quartz veins. Deep hydrothermal systems active in marine sedimentary rocks as they were being metamorphosed emplaced the gold. Initially, hydraulic mining was used to get at placer deposits, but it destroyed the landscape and choked rivers with sediments, ultimately being banned the California government in 1884. =Mining in the Klamath Mountains= Historically, 20 percent of the four million ounces of gold mined in California originated in the Klamath Mountains. Major Pierson Reading found gold in 1848 in the Trinity River near Douglas City. Miners extracted placer gold or dug up fossil placers in the Weaverville Formation and Hornbrook Formation. Gold lodes upstream of the placers were found as well, the largest being French Gulch 15 miles west of Redding. Gold appears in quartz veins that cut through slate, siltstone and shale originating in the Shasta Bally batholith. In addition to gold, platinum is sometimes found with gold placers. Chromite weathers out of peridotite in the Josephine ophiolite in Del Norte County and some beach placers close to Crescent City have up to seven percent chromite. The West Shasta district has a long history of copper and zinc production out of chalcopyrite and sphalerite. These sulfide minerals derive from the Copley Greenstone and or sea floor vents when the region was far offshore and formed as hot water \\"invaded\\" the Balaklala rhyolite. Around Shasta Reservoir are other copper and zinc deposits in the Triassic-age Bully Hill rhyolite. =Mercury and gold mining in the Coast Ranges= About 85 percent of mercury produced in the US throughout its history was mined in the Coast Ranges, with about $200 million worth extracted between 1850 and 1980. Mercury was first discovered in Santa Barbara County in 1796. New Idria, New Almaden and mines in the Mayacmas Mountains have been the main sources throughout history. The New Almaden mine opened in 1824, ultimately extending 2,450 feet below ground. By 1861 it already extended 250 feet below ground and produced 970 flasks of mercury a month. In the late 20th century, enough gold was found in association with the mercury, arsenic, tungsten and thallium to open the McLaughlin mine in the Mayacmas Mountains around Knoxville. =Oil and gas in California= Over 40 different oil and gas fields are found in association with the Transverse Ranges and their surrounding basins. Oil was first extracted in 1850 from the Pico Canyon field, close to Newhall with larger-scale production by 1875. The Ventura Avenue field, north of Ventura is one of the largest fields in California, producing since 1903. The small Conejo field to the east of Camarillo was geologically unusual in that the reservoir rock is fractured volcanic rock from the Miocene. Its main production ran from 1892 to the 1940s, supplying lubricating oil for other refineries. A machinist leased the property and used windmills to get small remaining amounts of oil out. California was the first place in the US to develop offshore oil drilling in the Summerland field, first found in 1896. In all, 20 oil fields are located in the Santa Barbara Channel, with one of the largest‚Äîthe Dos Cuadras field‚Äîfound in 1968, although a major spill on January 18, 1969 hampered interest in the field. Depth to oil is very shallow in the Santa Barbara Channel fields, at only 300 feet below the sea floor. Oil drilling in the Wilmington field cause up to 30 feet of subsidence at the eastern end of Terminal Island between 1937 and 1958. Construction workers needed to build dikes to protect a power plant and jack up bridges. Oil is also abundant in the San Joaquin Valley, but almost non-existent in the Sacramento Valley. Gas was first consumed in Stockton in the 1850s and the massive Rio Vista gas field was discovered in 1936. Substantially folding at the edge of the valley creates famous oil producing dome structures like Lost Hills and Kettleman Hills.

The route travels from the Alabama state line to at SR 18 near Barnesville. Traffic data shows it serves as the primary east-west route of both middle Troup County and Meriwether County. It is considered a medium priority route by the Georgia DOT for its entire length, except between the cities of Lagrange and Greenville, where it is considered a critical priority route. It is also the first east-west state route in west-central Georgia north of the Pine Mountain Range. SR 109 has one Spur route connecting Greenville to Gay. It was first designated on April 7, 1933 much shorter than it is today and shown in August 1933. Route description SR 109 is mostly rural except west of I-85. It serves as access to the middle part of West Point Lake and primary east-west access between LaGrange (I-85) and Greenville. With the exception of between US 27/SR 1 and I-85, SR 109 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =West Point Lake= SR 109 begins as a two lane road at the Alabama state line, where the roadway continues as CR 278, west of Abbottsford. The road heads eastward almost immediately crossing Wehadkee Creek, a tributary of West Point Lake. Then, it passes through Abbottsford, before crossing the main river of West Point Lake (Chattahoochee River). It continues eastward and enters LaGrange and intersects US 29/SR 14\\\\. From the Alabama state line until the aforementioned intersection, the road is named Roanoke Road. This leg of SR 109 serves many public recreation areas of West Point Lake in Georgia both directly and indirectly. SR 109 also provides easy access to the Alabama side of West Point Lake from Georgia; as SR 109 is one of two bridges across the Chattahoochee River of West Point Lake. SR 109 directly serves many of the public accesses and campgrounds for the lake including Pyne Road Park, the Wehadkee Service Area, Indian Springs Group Camp, and the Horace King Access and indirectly serves Highland Marina, McGee Bridge Recreation Area, Holiday Park, Whitetail Ridge Campground, Dewberry Recreation Area (Alabama), Evansville Recreation Area (Alabama), and the former Stateline Park (Georgia and Alabama) A small section just west of LaGrange near the bypass (Pegasus Parkway) =LaGrange to I-185= At the intersection of US 29/SR 14, it now turns eastward, beginning a concurrency with US 29/SR 14 as Vernon Street as a four-lane divided highway. Before entering downtown LaGrange SR 109 services Wellstar West Georgia Medical Center then slims into a two lane road just after the hospital. State Route 109 serves as the primary east-west route through downtown LaGrange. Continuing eastward toward downtown, the route then passes the Hills and Dales Estate and LaGrange College before arriving at Lafayette Square and the Lafayette Fountain. Just past LaFayette Square, the three routes meet US 27/SR 1/SR 219 (Morgan Street). At this intersection US 29/SR 14 depart to the north, along US 27/SR 1/SR 219 north. The road now takes the name Lafayette Parkway and becomes considered a critical priority route. On the east end of town, it services LaGrange Mall and other commercial businesses before it has an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85 Exit 18). East of the I-85 interchange, it helps service an industrial park that includes a Walmart distribution center. Narrowing down to a two lane road, it then crosses over, but does not interchange with I-185. =I-185 to SR 18= The route becomes a rural two lane road after the I-185 bridge with the exception of passing through small unincorporated towns. In Greenville, the highway loses its critical priority status as it meets US 27 Alternate/SR 18/SR 41, as well as SR 100 (North Depot Street). Here, US 27 Alternate/SR 18/SR 41/SR 109 run concurrent around the city square. SR 18 runs concurrent with SR 109 to the east. Just before leaving town named as the Woodbury Highway, they intersect SR 109 Spur (Gay Road). In Woodbury, is an intersection with SR 85 Alternate (Whitehouse Parkway). Then, they meet SR 74/SR 85\\\\. At this intersection, SR 74 joins the concurrency. Just before entering Molena, SR 74 splits off as Crest Highway. In town, SR 18 splits off to the north-northeast, while SR 109 heads east. The road heads northeast to a concurrency with US 19/SR 3, just west-southwest of Meansville. SR 109 heads through town and meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 18, located between Zebulon and Barnesville. =Traffic= The Georgia Department of Transportation average annual daily traffic (AADT) numbers for the year 2018 shows the daily average vehicle load in the thousands for most of its route, except in the city of Lagrange where it sees numbers in the ten- thousands. From its western terminus, the average load starts at 4,290 vehicles and increases to 7,860 near its turn onto US 29/SR 14. Upon joining US 29/SR 14, its value jumps to 17,100 and remains near these values until after it crosses US 27/SR 1 in downtown LaGrange. The volume was so high that a bypass (Pegasus Parkway) was proposed and eventually built. Within a short distance, the daily average vehicle load increases to 21,400 and with one exception, increases steadily to 24,300 at the interchange with I-85 marking this stretch the busiest for the entire route. Eastward of I-85, the values rapidly decrease from 16,300 to 8,360 at the I-185 bridge. As SR 109 continues eastward in Troup County, the values steadily decrease through 5,930 to 3,820 as it crosses into Meriwether County. Until the route reaches SR 74/SR 85, the vehicle load stays between 3,500 and 4,500. After crossing SR 85 and joining SR 74, the vehicle load jumps to 6,470 before lowering back to an average of 5,240 as it crosses into Pike County. After turning northward toward Molena, the load drops to 2,630 before separating away from SR 18. Leaving Molena, the value is the lowest for the entire route at 1,120 and remains at that level until it nears US 19/SR 3 and jumps to 2,790. Eastward of US 19/SR 3, the values drop back into the low one-thousands for the remainder of the route. History =1933‚Äì1970= The first portion of the roadway that is signed as SR 109 today was designated on April 7, 1933 and makes its first appearance in August 1933. It was unimproved but maintained and measuring and went between US 29/SR 14 in LaGrange to SR 41 in Greenville. In October 1933, a small portion near Greenville underwent some type of construction. In January 1935, SR 109 underwent construction from Greenville to the Meriwether‚ÄìTroup county line. Finally in October 1935, the entire length between Greenville and LaGrange was under construction. In April 1937, an unimproved but maintained section measuring travelled in an arc between the Alabama state line and US 29/SR 14 just west of LaGrange. Finally in January 1938, the Meriwether County section of 109 was graded but not surfaced. with the entire Greenville‚ÄìLaGrange section being graded by September 1938. A small section between US 29 and the Chattahoochee River was under some type of construction also at that time. By 1938, the future Pike County sections of SR 109 were built as was the Greenville-Gay section by, 1939 but none of these sections would be designated until later. The Greenville‚ÄìLaGrange section was the last upgrade in the 1930s being finally hard surfaced in January 1940. On September 25, 1940, a third section of SR 109 measured was listed as unimproved but maintained was designated where modern day SR 109 Spur runs, between Greenville and Gay and became hard surfaced by April 1941. In 1944, a fourth section long was designated between Molena and SR 3 in Pike County and by 1945 a small section of it was hard surfaced. Also in 1945, a portion of the second section of SR 109, between US 29/SR 14 and the Alabama state line, was hard surfaced from US 29/SR 14 to just past the Chattahoochee River near the future intersection of SR 244. North of this point to the Alabama state line was only a type of stabilized earth. In April 1949, the Greenville‚ÄìLaGrange section of SR 109 was designated a principal state route. Between January 1952 and September 1953, the section between SR 244 and the Alabama state line was graded but not hard surfaced along with the western half of the section between Molena and US 19/SR 3 while the eastern half of this section was hard surfaced. Also in 1952, SR 109 was shown designated throughout its entire Pike County routing; from SR 18 east of Molena to SR 18 near Barnesville. The eastern leg designation wouldn't show on state maps until 1960. The western half of this section was hard surfaced by June 1954. Between June 1955 and July 1957, more of SR 109 was hard surfaced from SR 244 to just north of the Heard‚ÄìTroup county line. Also, the stretch between Greenville and LaGrange was no longer designated a principal state highway. By June 1960, SR 109 was hard surfaced and designated on state maps for its entire length from the Alabama state line to its current terminus with SR 18 near Barnesville. No recorded changes were made until 1971. =1970‚Äì1997= In 1971, SR 109 begins to closely resemble the modern routing of the route. With the West Point Dam under construction, the 1971 route of SR 109 would soon be underwater which followed modern day Antioch Road and Old Roanoke Road. Thus the short-lived SR 701 and SR 701 Spur was marked under construction as a path over the future lake. In 1975, SR 701, its spur, and West Point Dam were completed as well as the SR 109/I-85 interchange was under construction to be completed in full by 1978. By 1976, the SR 109/I-85 interchange (as I-85 exit 4) was completed and SR 109 rerouted to follow SR 701 and SR 701 Spur respectively. By 1977, SR 109 now officially had two spur routes, one in Meriwether county from Greenville to Gay and one in Troup County from the Alabama state line to Abbottsford. Also in 1977, east of LaGrange began construction of modern day Lafayette Parkway (SR 109). Before and during the construction of this parkway, SR 109 turned north on Broad Street near LaGrange College and travelled through downtown LaGrange parallel with US 29/SR 14 until crossing US 27/SR 1. Continuing eastward, it followed Greenville Street until it met modern day Lafayette Parkway near State Route 14 Spur. East of I-85, the route follows its modern day routing to its eastern terminus. West of LaGrange, SR 109 follows its modern day path from US 29/SR 14 to Abbottsford but in 1980, turns north on modern day Rock Mills Road at its junction with then SR 109 Spur. Spur 109 follows the modern day routing of SR 109 from the Alabama state line to Abbottsford. By 1985, Lafayette Parkway as a two-lane road was opened and SR 109 relocated to it from Greenville Street. In 1986, SR 109 was a four-lane road for a short distance on either side of the I-85 interchange. In 1987, SR 109 became four lanes from just east of US 27/SR 1 to just east of the I-85 interchange. Also in 1987, the Troup county route of Spur 109 is abolished and the mainline takes its path west from Abbottsford to the Alabama state line. Sometime between 1993 and 1996, US 29/SR 14/SR 109 was rerouted from Vernon Road to the recently built Vernon Street. This is a four-lane divided highway from the Vernon Road junction to just after the split off of US 29/SR 14 which also upgraded added a second road entrance to the hospital. 1996 marks the first year with its modern day routing. Major intersections Special routes =Troup County spur route= State Route 109 Spur (SR 109 Spur) was a spur route that existed entirely within the west-central part of Troup County. Sometime in 1986, SR 109 Spur was merged into the SR 109 mainline thus abolishing the route. It began at the Alabama state line, where the roadway continued as CR 278\\\\. The road crossed over a tributary of the recently filled West Point Lake (Wehadkee Creek). It then passed the Harmony Cemetery, before it met its eastern terminus, an intersection with the SR 109 mainline, in Abbottsford. It was originally SR 701 Spur before West Point Lake was filled and while plans to reroute the mainline across the future lake were underway. =Meriwether County spur route= State Route 109 Spur (SR 109) is a spur route that connects SR 18/SR 109 (Woodbury Road) in Greenville to SR 74/SR 85 (Oakland Road) in Gay. It is located in the central and east-central parts of Meriwether County. The roadway itself existed as far back as 1939; however, wasn't designated as a state route until 1941 as mainline SR 109. Finally on March 31, 1976, the mainline was relocated further south with SR 18 and Gay Road changed to SR 109 Spur. A portion of this route is considered part of the Meriwether-Pike Scenic Byway since 2011. The route is known as Gay Road for its entire length.

He was popularly known as Karukurichi Arunachalam after Karukurichi, his native village in the Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu.  Life  Arunachalam was born in 1921 to Palavesam and Chellammal. Arunachalam's father, who was allegedly impressed by the fame and prestige enjoyed by musicians, especially nadaswaram players, wanted to become a nadaswaram player himself. Another account says he was inspired by the virtuosity of the nadaswaram player Koorainadu Natesa Pillai. Though Arunachalam's father trained for several years, he was not successful. Arunachalam's father taught him to play the nadaswaram. Arunachalam trained further on the nadaswaram under Kattumalli Subbiah and Vilathikulam Swamigal, and under Kalakkad Subbiah Bhagavatar and Kalakkad Ramanarayana Bhagavatar for vocal music. Arunachalam's break came when he not only had the opportunity to meet Pillai, but also accompanied him on stage when one of Pillai's deputies, Natarajasundaram Pillai, fell ill just before a concert. Impressed with Arunachalam's talent and love for the art, Pillai embraced Arunachalam as his full-time student (Gurukulavasam). Arunachalam honed his skills under the guru over the years and established a name for himself. Arunachalam quickly became a much sought after artist. Arunachalam's fame soared when he played for the Tamil movie Konjum Salangai, in which the hero is a nadaswaram player. The song \\"Singaravelane Deva\\" was a hit and often played at local events.

Founded in 1733, it was the first church established in the Province of Georgia and one of the first parishes within the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia, earning it the nickname \\"the Mother Church of Georgia\\". The present church building was constructed in 1838 and is located in the Savannah Historic District.  History  On February 12, 1733, colonists from England established the city of Savannah as the first city in the newly chartered Province of Georgia. Henry Herbert, a priest in the Anglican Church, was with them, establishing a mission in the city under the auspices of the Bishop of London. While a lot for a church building had been plotted by James Oglethorpe, the first services for the parish were open air and, after its construction in 1736, held in the city's courthouse. Following Herbert's departure from Georgia in late 1733, several missionaries would serve in the new colony, most notably John Wesley, who served in the city from February 1736 to December of the following year. While there, Wesley founded one of the first Sunday schools in the United States and held services at his house (which he would later cite as being an important moment in the creation of the Methodist movement), but difficulties in evangelizing the Native Americans in the region and friction between Wesley and residents of the city led to his departure less than two years later. Historic American Buildings Survey picture of Christ Church (1934). Following Wesley, George Whitefield would become the parish priest starting on December 1738. During his time in the colony, he founded the Bethesda Orphanage near Savannah in 1740. Shortly after Whitefield's tenure, in 1744, the cornerstone for the first permanent building for Christ Church was laid. The building was completed in 1750 and dedicated on July 7 of that year. In 1760, it received what was possibly the first organ in the province. The building was later expanded in 1765. This original church building burned down in 1796, with construction on a new building starting in 1801 and ending in 1806. This rebuilt building was consecrated by Bishop Theodore Dehon of South Carolina on April 26, 1815 in what was the first visit of a bishop to Georgia. On February 24, 1823, Christ Church became one of the three original parishes of the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia, along with Christ Church on St. Simon's Island and Saint Paul's Church in Augusta, Georgia. On February 26, 1838, construction began on a new building at the same location, which stands today as the current church building. This building, located on Johnson Square in the Savannah Historic District, was designed by James Hamilton Couper, a noted planter from the state. It was consecrated in 1840. During the mid-1800s, the rector was Stephen Elliott, the first bishop of the Diocese of Georgia and the only presiding bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. On January 8, 1854, Thomas Fielding Scott was consecrated bishop at Christ Church. In 2006, the church underwent a schism regarding the Episcopal Church's stance on homosexuality. In March 2006, a majority of the congregation of Christ Church voted to break ties with the Episcopal Church. Following a September 2007 vote to leave the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia, this breakaway group continued to hold service at the historic church building while parishioners who wished to remain with the Episcopal Church met at another nearby Episcopal church. The breakaway group vacated the historic building in December 2011 and began holding services at Independent Presbyterian Church. This was after the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled that the historic building was the property of Christ Church and the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia. The case also ruled that the church held the rights to \\"Christ Church, Savannah\\" and \\"the Mother Church of Georgia\\", with the breakaway group taking the name \\"Christ Church Anglican\\" to differentiate from the Episcopal congregation (sometimes referred to as \\"Christ Church Episcopal\\"). Both churches maintain the same history from 1733 to the split. In 2010, Christ Church Episcopal unveiled a new seal designed by local artist Louise Huntington Shipps, wife of Bishop Harry W.

History In the 1980s, many descendants of Republic of China Armed Forces migrated to Taiwan from Myanmar and Thailand seeking for a better life. Many of them settled in Zhonghe around this street area. The older generations of these people were the troops stationed in southern China who remained the country after the end of Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Those soldiers waited for Chiang Kai-shek's command, who has fled to Taiwan along with his troops, to retake back the mainland from the People's Liberation Army. Since the retake never happened, some of those troops migrated to Myanmar (then part of British India) and Thailand, and some also repatriated to Taiwan, with thousands more coming in the following decades.

A number of bombings targeted public places, such as bank branches,ATM's, commercial institutions and interests generally leaving material damage. Terrorism by context =√ëancahuazu insurgency= Ej√©rcito de Liberaci√≥n Nacional de Bolivia (National Liberation Army of Bolivia; ELN) was a group of mainly Bolivian and Cuban guerrillas led by the guerrilla leader Che Guevara which was active in the Cordillera Province of Bolivia from 1966 to 1967. The group established its base camp on a farm across the √ëancahuaz√∫ river, a seasonal tributary of the Rio Grande, 250 kilometers southwest of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The guerrilla was intended to work as a foco, a point of armed resistance to be used as a first step to overthrow the Bolivian government and create a socialist state. The guerrillas defeated several Bolivian patrols before they were beaten and Guevara was captured and executed. Only five guerrillas managed to survive and flee to Chile. Later that morning on October 9, Bolivian President Ren√© Barrientos ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed by F√©lix Rodr√≠guez to the Bolivian army unit holding Guevara, reportedly despite the US government's desire that Guevara be taken to Panama for further interrogation.Grant 2007 The executioner was Mario Ter√°n, a sergeant in the Bolivian army who had requested to shoot Che on the basis of the fact that three of his friends from B Company, all named \\"Mario\\", had been killed in an earlier firefight with Guevara's band of guerrillas. =Marxist Guerrillas= On June 11, 1990, members of the CNPZ group kidnapped businessman Jorge Lonsdale, the manager of the Vascal bottling firm (a Coca-Cola distributor), shareholder in La Raz√≥n newspaper, and member of La Paz's Club Social. Lonsdale's family members and the authorities were initially unaware that his kidnapping was the act of a political organization rather an ordinary attempt to extract ransom. Members of the N√©stor Paz Zamora Commission publicized its existence with graffiti bearing its initials and the phrase Bolivia digna y soberana (Bolivia dignified and sovereign) in August 1990. The group first gained international attention following an attack on the marine guardhouse at the United States embassy in October 1990.Profiles of Global Terrorism. During the October attack a police guard was shot dead. On December 4, police with the Centro Especial de Investigaciones Policiales (CEIP) captured Evaristo Salazar, one of two members of the Peruvian T√∫pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement operating within the CNPZ, during a sting operation in which Lonsdale's family promised to deliver ransom. Bolivian police fatally tortured Salazar, discovered the location where the group was keeping Lonsdale, and finally shot him later that night. During a police operation to retrieve Lonsdale, the kidnapped businessman and three CNPZ guerrillas were killed by gunshots, while two other CNPZ members were captured alive. A forensic report indicates that at least one of the guerrillas, Italian national Michael Northfuster, was shot at close range in an apparent execution. Another group, the Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation claimed responsibility for an assassination attempt on United States Secretary of State George P. Shultz in August 1988, the bombing of the Bolivian Parliament in December 1988, another bombing which caused a local blackout, the bombing of a The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse, the killings of two American missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on May 24, 1989, and the bombing of the US Embassy in a failed attempt to assassinate US Ambassador Robert S. Gelbard on December 20, 1989. By 1991, most members of the group had been apprehended, tried, convicted and imprisoned, and the organization was effectively disbanded. The most important of this group were the T√∫pac Katari Guerrilla Army, of indigenist inspiration, the movement had a multiracial membership. The organization descended directly from the original revolutionaries trained by Che Guevara in the 1960s. Their objective was to fight for social equality in Bolivia and amongst its indigenous population. They carried out their first attack on July 5, 1991, destroying an electric power pylon in El Alto, a major city which adjoins La Paz, Bolivia's administrative capital. Most of the group's attacks have been similarly small-scale and they had confined their activities largely to Bolivia. The group suffered a major setback in a crackdown in 1992, when much of its leadership was neutralized through incarceration. =21st Century incidents= In 13 may of 2005 an \\"cachorro\\" in front of the Petrobras offices in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Subsequently, different media received a video in which a Frente Nacional Anti-Corruption claims the action, in a video statement which claim a letter to Carlos Mesa and demanding 15 days for the Government to nationalize hydrocarbons and confiscate all the assets of former President Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada.

The Rajajel Columns is an archaeological site that is deemed the oldest archaeological site in the Al-Jawf region in Saudi Arabia, and it is located in the suburb of Qara, south of Sakaka, [1] It consists of 50 groups of erected stone columns called Rajajil, [2] and it has a number of stone pillars carved from sandstone. Their number ranges from three to seven columns, and some of the existing columns are higher than three meters, while they are about 60 cm thick. [1]  Etymology  It is called \\"Rajajil\\" which means men because it looks like a man if it is seen from a distance.  Historical Background  Some historians say that the Rajajil columns may belong to a temple built in the fourth millennium BC. The site contains about 50 groups of erect stone pillars and several broken columns lying on the ground. These groups are distributed in a large circle overlooking a wide sandy plain. Each group includes two to ten columns; one of which is approximately three meters high. Archaeologists say that archaeological assumptions believe that the site dates back to the fourth millennium BC, and the site needs to carry out various excavations to find its secrets and mysteries. These columns are very similar to the stones ( Stonehenge ) found in Britain, which dates back to the third millennium BC. [2] Perhaps this site is a complex of different temples, each group of columns link to a people or a tribe. Therefore, it is believed that the site was a religious center where human groups from outside the region visit to perform their religious rituals. [1]  Domat Al-Jandal Museum document  It is a document found in the Dumat Al-Jandal Museum that indicates that the stone form of the columns may be related to ritual beliefs most of the time, or it is like one of the inferential forms of astronomy. Also, the document indicates that the economic situation of the interior regions in the Arabian Peninsula, which are areas located to The south of the desert of Nafud remained, seemed unchanged until about the second millennium B.C. and represented in the practice of grazing livestock from goats, cows and sheep, in addition to relying on hunting and gathering food. The document adds that, in about 4000 BC, the influence of pottery and the practice of simple agriculture, hunting and grazing came to the north of the Arabian Peninsula. This civilization was established in the north of the Arabian Peninsula to form part of a broader civilization that extended during the fourth millennium BC Sinai, eastern Jordan, southern Syria, and western Iraq. It was called a metallic Stone Age civilization due to its discovery of the copper smelting method. This civilization is distinguished by the stone circles villages that may have been used for seasonal housing. The document refers to the site of Rajajeel by saying, \\"There is an exciting complex of stones and rubble near Sakaka is known as the Rajajil Columns and was an important center. It has similars in the Sinai. \\"[2]  The Antiquities of the Rajajel columns  Through the efforts of the General Administration of Antiquities and Museums, many archaeological sensors were discovered through excavation at the site of the Rajajil columns in 1396 AH-1397 AH (1975-1976). Also, man-made stone tools such as scrapers, broths, blades, and a small number of pottery pieces were discovered. These findings indicate the date of the site that dates back to the copper age in the fourth millennium BC. [4] There is similarity between Stonehenge in Britain and these Rajajeel Columns in Skaka that date back to the third and second millennium BC. Also, there are similarities between the columns of Rajajil in Al-Jawf, and between the patterns of stone circles found in Al-Qassim specifically located in the south of Shoaib Al-Atashan near the center of Hanizal in the north Buraidah.

Built in 1968, Mallick Tower was the first highrise in downtown Fort Worth west of Henderson Street. The building is located on a 1.8 acre lot, is 10 stories high, offers 90,000 square feet of office space, and stands at a height of 112 ft.  History and Opening  The tower was conceived and built by George A. Mallick, Jr. (b.1934 - d. 1999), a successful Fort Worth real estate developer. The lavish opening party that year included the arrival of Congressman Jim Wright to the party by helicopter. The relationship between the two men would later be investigated in the Federal ethics review of Congressman Wright over money given to him by Mr. Mallick. The investigation began in 1988 and concluded with the resignation of the then Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1989.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V17/pdf/GPO- HPREC-DESCHLERS-V17-5-5-1.pdf Mr. Mallick continued to develop other large multi-tenant residential and commercial projects around the Fort Worth area prior to his death in 1999. He is buried in Greenwood Memorial Park and Mausoleum in Fort Worth, TX.  2000 Tornado  The building was one of the downtown high-rises that bore the brunt of the 2000 tornado which destroyed much of downtown Ft Worth. The building sustained near complete damage of the south and west facing sides of the building and sustained a large amount of internal water and wind damage.http://www.depts.ttu.edu/nwi/Pubs/ReportsJournals/ReportsJournals/D3-28-00-Tor- FtWorth.pdf The building was rebuilt and renovated the following year as well as in 2009. In 2013, Mallick Tower was recognized as a City of Fort Worth Smartwater Award winner for changes that allowed savings of over 250,000 gallons of water per year.https://fortworthtexas.gov/savefwwater/commercial/2013-smartwater- winners/  Heliport  Mallick Tower Heliport (TX77) is a rooftop heliport located on Mallick Tower positioned at an elevation of 695 ft.

It was active between 1939 and 1945.  History  The 168th Infantry Division was formed in the G√∂rlitz area on 1 December 1939 as a division of the seventh Aufstellungswelle. It initially consisted of the Infantry Regiments 417 and 429, as well as the Light Artillery Detachment 248. The latter was soon transferred to the 164th Infantry Division, and the 168th was strengthened to full division strength by the addition of a third regiment, numbered 442, and a full Artillery Regiment, numbered 248. The division's deployment took from December 1939 until May 1940. During this time, the 168th Infantry Division remained at home, in Wehrkreis VIII in Silesia. The first divisional commander was Wolf Boysen. On 11 January 1940, Hans Mundt replaced Boysen as divisional commander. In June 1940, the 168th Infantry Division was moved to the reserves of the 1st Army (Army Group C) during the Battle of France. After that campaign's conclusion, the 168th Infantry Division was placed in occupied Poland under the supervision of the XXXXIV Army Corps, which was in turn part of the 18th Army (Army Group B). The 168th Infantry Division remained in Poland between July 1940 and May 1941, at times part of the XXXXIV, XVII, and XXIX Corps, which were in turn at times part of the 18th, 12th, 17th and 6th Armies.Dietrich Kraiss, divisional commander of the 168th Infantry Division between July 1941 and March 1943. In June 1941, during the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the 168th Infantry Division was subordinate to the XXIX Army Corps under the 6th Army, which was part of Army Group South. During the subsequent invasion of the Soviet Union, the 168th stood in the Lublin area in June 1941, moved to the Zhytomyr area in July, then advanced, as part of the XXXIV Army Corps, to the Kiev region in August and September. Here, the 168th Infantry Division took part in the Battle of Kiev of 1941. The division's command had by then been taken over by Dietrich Kraiss, who began his tenure on 8 July. After operations as part of the XXIX Army Corps in the Romny area in October and under LI Army Corps in the Belgorod area in November, the 168th Infantry Division spent the end of the year 1941 in the Kharkiv region, again part of the XXIX Army Corps. Combat in the Kharkiv area dragged on until July 1942. The 168th Infantry Division spent this entire time nominally as part of the XXIX Army Corps, but its forces were heavily subdivided and distributed in parts to the XXXXVIII Corps and the LV Corps, both under the 2nd Army, between January and April 1942. In May 1942, the 168th Infantry Division fought in the Second Battle of Kharkov. In August, the division, again as a whole, was moved out of the 6th Army for the first time since before the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union. It was briefly deployed to the Voronezh region as part of the VII Army Corps under the 2nd Army (Army Group B), before being reassigned again to serve under the XXIV Army Corps, which in turn was part of the Hungarian Second Army at the Don River. The 168th Infantry Division remained part of the XXIV Army Corps between September and December 1942. In January 1943, the 168th Infantry Division was assigned to the Fourth Hungarian Corps at the Don, before serving under Corps Cramer in February and under Corps Raus (Army Detachment Kempf, Army Group South) in the Myrhorod region in March. On 9 March, Walter Chales de Beaulieu assumed divisional command of the 168th Infantry Division. In June, the 168th was reassigned to the XI Army Corps (Army Detachment Kempf). The division returned to the Belgorod area, where it had already fought as part of the LI Army Corps in November 1941. After brief service as part of the III Army Corps in July, the 168th Infantry Division, now again part of the XI Army Corps, was moved once more to the Kharkiv area. The German defeat at the Battle of Kursk cause a wave of German retreats during which the 168th Infantry Division suffered heavy casualties. In September 1943, the XI Army Corps, with the 168th Infantry Division under it, was assigned to the 8th Army and deployed to the Kiev area, where the 168th Infantry Division was again placed under the III Army Corps in October. On 1 December 1943, Werner Schmidt-Hammer assumed command of the 168th Infantry Division. Between November 1943 and February 1944, the 168th Infantry Division served under the 4th Panzer Army as part of the XXIV Army Corps. During this period, the XXIV Corps was active in the Kiev, Shitomir and Vinnytsia areas. Near Cherkasy, the 168th Infantry Division was battered by heavy Soviet attacks after it was trapped in the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket. In March 1944, the XXIV Army Corps was reassigned, along with the 168th Division, to the 1st Panzer Army in the Kamianets-Podilskyi region. Here, the 168th Infantry Division was again trapped by enemy forces, this time the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. Afterwards, the division was briefly allowed to return to Poland to rebuild its strength, but the formation never again exceeded Kampfgruppe strength. Between April and June 1944, the 168th Infantry Division was part of the XXXXVI Corps in the Ternopil area. The corps was still part of the 1st Panzer Army, but the army was now part of the newly formed Army Group North Ukraine. Between July and September 1944, the 168th Infantry Division was part of the XI Army Corps in the Carpathian Mountains. On 8 September 1944, Carl Anders took command of the division from Schmidt-Hammer. In October, the 168th was assigned to the XXXXIX Army Corps, still under the 1st Panzer Army, but now as part of Army Group A. Between November and December, the 168th served again as part of the XI Army Corps. Anders was replaced as divisional commander by Schmidt-Hansen, who started his second tenure in this post, on 9 December 1944. In January 1945, the 168th Infantry Division was subordinate to the XXXXVIII Corps under the 4th Panzer Army in the Baran√≥w area. After Maximilian Rosskopf had briefly taken command of the division on 6 January 1945, Schmidt-Hammer assumed command for the third and final time on 19 February. Between February and May 1945, the 168th Infantry Division spent the last months of the war in Silesia, the same area in which it was originally formed. The final formation that the 168th served under was the XXXX Corps, part of the 17th Army. The final commander of the division was one Oberst Hansen, who took charge of the division in the last few days of the war, as late as May 1945.

It is distributed by Medusa Games, part of Medusa Film, distributor of the trio's films. In the game Aldo, Giovanni and Giacomo are voiced by themselves. The game is imbued with the comedy of the trio and also with some lines already used in theatrical performances. The name \\"Zero Comico\\" (that literally translate as \\"Zero Comic\\") derives from a line from the show of the trio I corti di Aldo, Giovanni & Giacomo, in which the \\"Zero Comico\\", understood philosophically as the simplest comic message possible, is represented by Tafazzi, a character played by Giacomo. Plot The story takes place on Earth in the third millennium. A phantom technocratic regime established by the planetary federation forces the planet's population to live in bunker houses; the only contact with the outside world is television. In one of these bunker houses live Aldo, Giovanni and Giacomo; one day they are contacted through television by an individual (who looks like Tafazzi) who communicates to the three that they are the people who will have to destroy Pdor (a character played by Giovanni in one of the trio's theatrical shows, Tel chi el tel√πn), the head of the regime, and bring happiness back to the whole planet. Upon entering the realm of Pdor, he explains that they will have to go through five levels in the world of video games and other kinds of popular references, and upon completion of each of these levels a piece of the device will be delivered that will restore happiness to the whole planet, thus defeating Pdor. Eventually the three reassemble the device; but when Pdor refuses to admit defeat, Aldo destroys the system by insulting Pdor heavily. The three, however, remain incredulous when they discover that the device that will restore happiness to the whole planet is only a hologram of Tafazzi in his most famous sketch. Gameplay The player controls one character at a time. The first three levels are played entirely with one character each (the others, except in a few cutscenes, remain in one room as non-playing characters), while in the last two levels the characters \\"share\\" the various corridors, \\"giving the change\\" and passing the inventory items. The character is controlled with the directional keys, he can walk or run, collect objects, combine them with each other and use them with elements of the scenario or other characters. Being a graphic adventure, the game is focused on solving puzzles, and the characters have no energy statistics or keystrokes of combat, even if this does not mean that the protagonists never commit violent actions. It is possible at any time to choose between three different types of view: as if there were cameras positioned high along the walls, or in first person view or with a third person view, from behind the back. Development The game is made in polygonal 3D graphics, which is also used during short interludes within the levels. The initial, final and intermission films between the various levels are prerendered. Not all dialogues are dubbed, but only those of prerendered interludes and cutscenes, while the others appear only in text format. The character design was curated by Andrea Cuneo.

The cone is used to hold a to-be slaughtered bird upside down, thus allowing for the animal to be bled more easily.  Description  Killing cones are used to facilitate the slaughter of poultry, normally chicken, ducks, or geese. Such cones come in a number of different sizes to accommodate different sized birds. The cone functions by holding a bird in place - a captive bird can be placed head first into the funnel so that the animal's head hangs down through the small part of the funnel. The animal can then be bled (normally via an incision in the throat) more easily while the funnel contains any wing motions and facilitates the draining of blood. According to some sources, killing cones have the added benefit of inducing a sense of disorientation, relaxation, and euphoria in a captive bird as some birds exhibit tonic immobility when held upside down.SPARREY, J., SANDERCOCK, D., SPARKS, N., & SANDILANDS, V.

Thomasson has studied the impact that pandemics and epidemics can have on education, taking as a case the closure of schools during the 1916 New York City polio epidemic. During that epidemic, school openings in New York City were delayed by two weeks, and Thomasson and her co-authors demonstrated that the closures had a measurable affect on the children who experienced it, lowering the number of achievements they had when they graduated and also decreasing their probability of graduating at all. Thomasson has also shown that once schools did reopen, about 200,000 of the 829,000 students in the city did not return immediately, for fear of contracting the disease. During the widespread school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the NPR outlet WAMU cited Thomasson's research on this topic as a signal that parents might not permit their children to return to school immediately after schools officially reopen. An article in Forbes, citing the WAMU report on Thomasson's research, speculated that many parents might experiment with alternative means of education such as homeschooling shortly after policies allow schools to reopen. Thomasson has been regularly interviewed in news outlets on topics relating to health care and health coverage in America. She has studied the pressures that act on drug prices, and she discussed the economic history of drug prices in an interview for WNYC. She has also been interviewed on the topic of health care in America for NBC, WGBH, and NPR.

Education and personal life Margaret Waugh was born on February 23, 1926 in Willimantic, Connecticut. Her father was agricultural economist Frederick V. Waugh and her grandfather was horticulturist Frank Albert Waugh. She was active in the mathematics club at Oberlin College in the mid-1940s, and graduated from Oberlin in 1947. After earning a master's degree in 1948 from the University of Wisconsin, she completed her Ph.D. in 1951 at the University of Oregon. Her dissertation, Fermat's Theorem for Matrices over a Modular Ring, was supervised by Ivan M. Niven. In 1948 she had married John Edward Maxfield, another student at Wisconsin and the University of Oregon who became her frequent collaborator. As students, both Maxfields visited the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, then known as the Naval Ordnance Test Station, in the summers. After completing their doctorates they worked at the station from 1951 until 1960, when John Maxfield took a succession of academic posts at the University of Florida, Kansas State University, and (beginning in 1981) at Louisiana Tech University. Margaret, also, became a professor of business at Kansas State, and a professor of mathematics and statistics at Louisiana Tech. By 2011 Maxfield had retired, but was still active in mathematics, and noted to her alumni magazine that she was using Wikipedia to find bibliographic material for her papers. She died on December 20, 2016, in Placerville, California. Contributions While at the Naval Ordnance Test Station, Maxfield coauthored the book Statistics Manual: With Examples Taken from Ordnance Development, with Edwin L. Crow and Frances A. Davis. It was published by the station in 1955, and reprinted by Dover Books in 1960. With John Maxfield, she was also the coauthor of Contemporary Mathematics for General Education: Algebra (Allyn and Bacon, 1963, also with S. Gould Sadler) Abstract Algebra and Solution By Radicals (W. B. Saunders, 1971; reprinted by Dover Books, 1992), Discovering Number Theory (W. B. Saunders, 1972), and Keys to Mathematics (W. B. Saunders, 1973) Maxfield was one of the 1968 winners of the Lester R. Ford Award of the Mathematical Association of America for a paper with her father on the rational approximation of square roots.

Officially, the CB was enforced by the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, published on 7 April 2020.  Chronology  = Prelude (27 March) = On 24 March, the Multi-Ministry Task Force announced more stricter measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, after a huge spike in cases originating from returning Singaporeans in the community. These measures include the closure of entertainment venues, tuition and enrichment centres and places of worship. Malls, retail establishments and tourist attractions were required to reduce their crowd density in order to stay open. Gatherings of more than 10 people outside of work and school are prohibited. = Initial measures (7 April) = On 3 April, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced a nationwide partial lockdown, known as a circuit breaker, to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. These measures came after an increase of unlinked cases over the preceding month, as well as the risk of a huge cluster of infections. All non-essential workplaces closed from 7 April, with essential workplaces remaining open. All schools transitioned to home-based learning from 8 April. All food establishments were only allowed to offer take-away, drive-thru and delivery of food. In addition, the wearing of masks by healthy individuals was no longer discouraged. These measures would initially lapse on 4 May. On 14 April, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong made the wearing of masks compulsory when not at home with immediate effect, with fines and prosecution for offenders who refuse to do so. = Tightened measures (21 April) = After discovering that the unknown number of cases was greater than expected, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on 21 April an extension of the circuit breaker to 1 June. Existing measures were also tightened until 4 May initially, including shrinking the list of essential services, such as closing all close-contact service providers such as hair salons, as well as restricting entry to certain hotspots like wet markets and some essential retail franchises going by the last digit of one's ID number. Popular markets utilized an odd/even date entry restriction; ID ending with odd numbers are only allowed entry on odd dates of the month and ID ending with even numbers are only allowed entry on even dates on the month. The Singapore franchise of McDonald's also shut all of its restaurants islandwide, as a response to a number of its employees being infected. = Relaxed measures (2 May) = Some restrictions were relaxed progressively in stages to prepare for the end of the circuit breaker on 1 June. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shops and essential condo activities were allowed to reopen on 5 May, followed by businesses like home-based bakeries (HBBs), some food shops, barbers (only basic haircuts), manufacturing of confectionery, and laundry shops on 12 May. Schools resumed face-to-face lessons for smaller groups in graduating cohorts and those requiring urgent assistance on 19 May. At the same time, the Ministry of Health (MOH) mandated the use of SafeEntry contact-tracing system at all businesses and services from 12 May, but does not include \\"transient\\" locations like the MRT or parks, although people are encouraged to scan to assist in contact-tracing efforts. On 8 May, the MOH announced that all TCM shops are allowed to sell retail products again from 12 May, after receiving feedback from seniors that travelling to TCM medical halls was too far for them.  Post-circuit breaker (reopening)  Three phases of planned reopening were announced on 19 May, namely \\"Safe Reopening\\" (phase 1), \\"Safe Transition\\" (phase 2) and finally \\"Safe Nation\\" (phase 3); the third phase will last until an effective treatment or vaccine is found to stop the spread of COVID-19. Phase 1 started on 2 June, while Phase 2 started on 19 June, and remains in force as of October 2020.

Washington Aluminium Co., 370 U.S. 9 (1962), was a US labor law United States Supreme Court concerning the right of workers to engage in protected concerted activity.

The machine shop employed eight workers and one foreman. Employees had complained of the cold temperature prior to January 5, 1959, when the night watchmen was unable to start the gas furnace, which served as the shops primary source of heat, on a particularly cold day. The seven employees decided to leave for the day. The seven employees were fired that day. The National Labor Relations Board ruled that the employee walk out was a protected form of protest under the National Labor Relations Act's section 7, which protects the rights of workers regardless of whether they are in a union to engage in group activity to improve their working conditions, ordering the company to reinstate the workers. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the walk out was not protected because, although the employees left because of the cold, they did not make a specific demand to their employer.  Opinion of the Court  In an opinion written by Justice Hugo Black, the court overturned the lower court's ruling, arguing that language defining protected concerted activity was written \\"is broad enough to protect concerted activities whether they take place before, after, or at the same time such a demand is made.\\" The opinion also ruled that the workers' prior complaints about temperature in the winter constituted a labor dispute as defined by the National Labor Relations Act..

The paper was founded as the North Bend Post in 1913 and has published continuously since 1923 as the Snoqualmie Valley Record. The paper covers news in the Snoqualmie Valley, which includes North Bend, Snoqualmie, Preston, Fall City, Carnation, and Duvall. History The paper originated from the North Bend Post which began operations on October 16, 1913 in the Tanner district east of North Bend. The paper was published by B.N. Kennedy, who earlier had established the Bridgeport Post in April 1904. In 1913, the paper masthead was changed to the Snoqualmie Post, edited by J.R. Walkup and distributed to the Upper Snoqualmie Valley. George Astel, a printer and publisher, created the Snoqualmie Valley Record In 1923, to serve as another paper for the Snoqualmie Valley as well as a start for his printing business. In 1923, George Astel bought H. W. Rodman's Snoqualmie Post and merged it with the Snoqualmie Valley Record. Once the two papers consolidated, the Snoqualmie Valley Record office was expanded to fit the machinery from the Post. The paper was distributed for free within the Snoqualmie Valley with a reported circulation of 1,500 in 1923. When the two papers merged, Frances Harrison (Astel's wife) took over responsibilities as Editor-In-Chief and Business Manager, as Astel chose to focus his efforts on developing a statewide printing business, Craftsman Press. The Record was purchased by Robert Sawyer in 1928. Sawyer expanded coverage to surrounding areas all the way up to Duvall. The paper credits two staff journalists, but Sawyer would supplement their small staff by receiving news though letter correspondence. In 1944 Sawyer sold the paper to Dale Krebs, a Linotype operator with experience working at weekly publications in Nebraska, California, and Alaska. In 1949, Charlotte Paul Groshell and her husband Ed Groshell bought the newspaper for $30000 from Dale Krebs. While running the paper, Charlotte wrote several best- selling books including the 1955 Minding Our Own Business published by Random House, in which she detailed her and her husbands life purchasing and operating the Snoqualmie Valley Record. The book was dedicated to \\"the Valley Record subscriber\\". The book was a bestseller in 1955 and a sequel titled And Four to Grow was written shortly after. Bob Scott, Sandie Scott, and Gaillard Buchman purchased the paper from Charlotte and Ed Groshell In the mid-1960s and created Falls Printing Co., which owned and operated the paper. Bob Scott became the publisher of the paper. After 36 years, in 1996, Falls Printing Co. sold the Valley Record to Karen and Jim McKiernan, the daughter and son in-law of Bob and Sandie Scott. The newspaper was again sold after just 4 years to King County Journal Newspapers, In December 2000, a company owned by the Horvitz family, which published several newspapers, including the King County Journal. In 2006, King County Journal Newspapers was sold to Sound Publishing, a local newspaper publisher focusing on papers in Western Washington. It was announced on March 25, 2020, that due to the COVID-19 pandemic Sound Publishing would reduce staffing and suspended the print version of the Valley Record indefinitely but continue to publish digitally.

De Vries is a leader in the field of blood brain barrier research. She founded the Dutch Blood Brain Barrier Network and is the President of the International Brain Barrier Society. De Vries‚Äô research explores the interactions between the brain and the immune system and she specifically looks at neurovascular biology in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease.  Early life and education  De Vries was born in The Netherlands. In 1990, she pursued her graduate studies in pharmacology at Leiden University in Leiden, The Netherlands. She graduated in 1995 and then pursued her postdoctoral training at University College London in the United Kingdom supported by the Marie-Curie Fellowship.  Career and research  After completing her postdoctoral research, De Vries received the VIDI grant from the Dutch research council (NWO) which supported her to start her own lab in Amsterdam at the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Universitair Medische Centra) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. De Vries holds the title of Full Professor in the Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology. As the principal investigator of a lab, she focuses her research program on brain- immune interactions in the context of neurological diseases. She probes how blood brain barrier disruptions impact the immune cells in the brain, and how neurovascular biology impacts the inflammatory state of the brain. Her research has led to novel insights into the role of blood brain interactions in Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. She has found that alterations of the neurovascular unit precipitate neurodegenerative diseases and these diseases are also marked by plaque deposits in brain vasculature which impacts brain homeostasis and disease progression. De Vries is a leader in the field of neuroimmunology and neurovascular interactions. As such, she leads and directs multiple national and international groups to support collaboration and scientific discoveries in Blood Brain Barrier research and neuroimmunology research towards finding treatments for disease. De Vries is a member of the management team at the Multiple Sclerosis Centrum Amsterdam, she was the chair of the 2011 Cerebral Vascular Biology Meeting held in Leiden, The Netherlands, and in 2013 she was elected to the International Brain Barriers Society council. In 2015, she founded Brendinn Therapeutics (Brain Endothelial Innovation) and serves as chair to oversee translational and clinical innovations in treating brain diseases through targeting brain-vascular interactions. To promote research on the blood brain barrier, De Vries, along with fellow Dutch Colleagues, founded the Dutch Blood Brain Barrier Network (BBBNedwork). De Vries also promotes and leads blood brain barrier research on the international scale as she was recently elected as the President of the International Brain Barrier Society. = MicroRNAs in blood brain barrier regulation = The blood brain barrier (BBB) is critical to controlling the homeostasis of the central nervous system. Small changes to BBB permeability due to damage or disease can be severely detrimental to brain health and further, changes in BBB have been implicated in various neurological diseases. De Vries and her colleagues made a discovery about the importance of microRNAs in BBB function. They found that specifically the microRNA miR-125a-5p seemed to play a key role in regulating brain-endothelial tightness and immune cell migration into the brain and this microRNA also appeared to be decreased in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Their findings suggest that targeting microRNAs to repair a leaky BBB in disease might hold promise as a novel treatment approach for disease like MS. = Multiple sclerosis = De Vries has conducted extensive research into the mechanisms of MS pathogenesis as well as novel ways it could be treated. In 2007, De Vries explored the potential of targeting reactive oxygen species as a therapy for MS since oxidation is known to precipitate and contribute to MS pathogenesis. De Vries proposed antioxidant therapy as a potential form of treatment for MS to inhibit the development or progression of the disease. Since sphingolipid metabolism had been shown to be implicated in various neurological disorders, De Vries then probed how alterations to the sphingolipid, ceramide, alter disease processes. She found that in the brains of MS patients, astrocytes were the main producers of ceramide. De Vries showed that using Fingolimod could reduce the production of pro-inflammatory lipids by activated astrocytes in MS and serve as a potential therapy. Interestingly, De Vries work has also shown the beneficial side of astrocytes in neuroinflammation. Astrocytes produce retinoic acid which acts as an endogenous anti-inflammatory compound protecting the BBB from degradation and harm due to inflammation. = Cell migration into brain = Much of De Vries work has also focused on how the BBB is involved in immune cell trafficking to the brain. She has found that much of the pathogenesis in MS is caused by CD4 T-cells trafficking across the brain endothelium. Her work also highlighted the mechanisms underlying this trafficking. When myelin is being degraded inside the brain, brain endothelial cells act as antigen presenting cells through presenting myelin-derived antigens in MHC-II to T-cells in the periphery. De Vries‚Äô discovery of a fundamental role of endothelial cells in promoting T-cell infiltration in MS was critical in establishing the antigen presentation capacity of the blood brain barrier. De Vries later found that monocyte diapedesis into the brain during inflammation is mediated by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Continuing to probe the various way that immune cells infiltrate the brain, De Vries found that the NMDA receptor subunit 1 is expressed on the endothelial cells lining the BBB and is involved in regulating tPA which permits the entry of monocytes from the periphery into the CNS. In a following study, De Vries probed the biology of macrophage infiltration into the CNS. She found that activation status played a critical role on the effects of the chemoattractant properties of cytokines. Her work laid the foundation to further understand how activation affects macrophage migration into the CNS both in health and disease.

The composer, Raoul Laparra, was his younger brother.  Biography  His father, Joseph Edouard Laparra (1850-?), was a merchant who originally came from Spain. He began his artistic education at the √âcole de Dessin de Bordeaux then, in 1892, went to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Julian, where his instructors included William Bouguereau, Tony Robert-Fleury and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. He was awarded the Prix de Rome at the age of twenty-two for his painting depicting the Pool of Bethsaida.Biography, in: G√©rald Schurr and Pierre Cabanne, Dictionnaire des petits ma√Ætres de la peinture, Paris, Les √©ditions de l'Amateur, 2008 In 1902, he married Franciszka Wanda Landowska (1879-1904); sister of the sculptor Paul Landowski. He also became acquainted with the painter, Ignacio Zuloaga, who was then living in Paris, and exhibited frequently in several venues, including the Salon. Later, he served as a Professor at the Acad√©mie Julian. A few years after Franciszka's early death, he married Fanny Bertrand (1889-1939); daughter of the geologist, Marcel Alexandre Bertrand, and sister of the painter, Claire Bertrand. As the son of a Spaniard, he was influenced by that country's culture and took an extended trip there from 1908 to 1909; stopping in Burgos, Madrid and Toledo. Upon returning, he settled in Boulogne- Billancourt. He would also travel throughout Italy, Greece and Egypt. In addition to painting, he maintained an interest in the social issues of his time, which was reflected in some of his major works; such as \\"The Steps of Jacques Bonhomme\\"', which was shown at the \\"\\", one of the first workers' cooperatives in France.Bertrand Ducourau, Ic√¥nes et Idoles, Actes Sud, 2008 . His favorite subjects for genre scenes involved daily life among the peasantry; treated in a harsh, somber style, but his portraits tended to more cheerful and featured bourgeoise subjects. Several retrospectives have featured his works; notably at Bordeaux in 1997. Over 100 of his works have been acquired by the R√©union des mus√©es nationaux. His works may be seen at the Mus√©e du Louvre, Mus√©e d'Orsay, √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts, Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Bordeaux and the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Rouen, among many others.

The maximum depth of K√§ina Bay is about 1 meter. K√§ina Bay is separated from the V√§inameri Sea by Kassari Island, √ïunaku Bay and Jausa Bay by a dyke road. There are many thickets of reeds and islets (23). In the southern part of the bay there is mineral curative mud.  Water regime  Average high water level in K√§ina Bay lasts from November until March and critically low water level period is from April until June. Most extreme changes in the sea level; onto which water level in the bay reacts with certain time lag, occur in the open sea from September until March, when stronger winds prevail. Sea level variability in the K√§ina Bay is smaller comparing to Baltic Sea. Two types of water exchange regime occur in the K√§ina Bay, which depend on the water level in the open sea. In the case of higher sea level water in the Vaemla Bay rises faster due to transport through √ïunaku sill comparing to K√§ina Bay and as a consequence, open sea water arrives to the K√§ina bay also through Vaemla channel. In the case of lower sea level water exchange through √ïunaku sill does not occur and therefor saltier water inflow (outflow) to (from) the Vaemla Bay occurs through K√§ina Bay.

Total area of the reserve is , including areas permanently covered by water . The history of this protected area dates back to 1939, when the Kassari and Vaemla Bay curative mud areas were protected. In 1962, two protected areas were established: the Kassari Island Landscape Protection Area and the K√§ina Bay Ornithological Protection Area, which were merged to form the K√§ina Bay-Kassari Landscape Protection Area in 1998. This area is maintained and improved with the support of various public funds, including support from the European Union Cohesion Fund and Enviromental Investment Centre environmental programme. Vaemla region at the K√§ina Bay-Kassari Landscape Reserve on the south-eastern edge received the necessary tools for coastal meadow maintenance. The channels would ensure normal water exchange in the bay and at the same time create a favorable condition for the local habitats and species. Based on the 2017 study of the Taltech Department of Marine Systems about the condition of K√§ina Bay and Vaemla Bay, and the efficiency of water regulators and recommendations therein, the works in the watercourses were implemented in May 2020. During the works, reeds and sediment were removed from Puulaiu, Orjaku sill and Laisna channel. The works commissioned by the Environmental Board were financed from the European Union Cohesion Fund within the framework of investments in the project ‚ÄúPreservation and Restoration of Protected Species and Habitats‚Äù. = Ramsar Site = Hiiumaa islets and K√§ina Bay site has been listed the list of Ramsar sites in Estonia as one of 17 Estonian wetlands of international importance. The Hiiumaa Islets and K√§ina Bay site () is a complex of coastline and small islands on the southeast coast of Hiiumaa Island, which in turn lies off the west coast of the Estonian mainland. The area is hydrologically highly prized for the prevention of coastal erosion, sediment trapping, maintenance of water quality, and support of food chains. Here, too, rich communities of endangered orchids can be found. The mix of state and private lands supports about 100 inhabitants but is an important area for fishing and ecotourism, as well as for environmental education, scientific research, and curative sea mud (peloid). = Biosphere reserve = West Estonian Archipelago, including K√§ina Bay, was from 1990 listed as UNESCO Biosphere Reserve which are wholly or partially World Heritage sites.  Mineral resource deposit  According to the Earth's Crust Act and Environmental Register national mineral resource K√§ina sea mud deposit is located in the western part of K√§ina Bay, where near Orjaku village organic mineral mud is being excavated and used by the cosmetics industry, for curative purposes and SPA industry. Estonian mineral mud has been studied extensively in the past. The latest research was conducted in 2013-2014 by The Centre of Excellence in Health Promotion and Rehabilitation. The results confirm that K√§ina Bay contains the most mineral sediments and the lowest concentrations of heavy metals out of all analyzed mud deposits in Estonia. On the lithological composition on average K√§ina Bay peloid contains 91.4% of minerals, 6.5% of organic matter, and 3.7% of carbonates. The sediments in K√§ina Bay are ecologically cleanest in Estonia.

The furnace was situated in the Churnet Valley in the Staffordshire moorlands. A later Elizabethan-era blast furnace once stood on the site of the present Old Furnace Cottage. That furnace, the first in the north of England, was constructed in 1592 by Lawrence Loggin.\\"Oldfurnace Cottage, Oakamoor\\" - Wessex Archaeology The stone was brought three miles from Hollington by mule down an ancient trackway. This path can still be seen in the field next to the cottage. Problems arose from the outset, and after nine months the site was abandoned, which gave way to its old furnace name. An archaeological evaluation undertaken in 2004, in unison with an episode of the British archaeology television programme Time Team, revealed that iron smelting using the bloomery process, with associated pottery of the 13th and 14th century dates, was well established on the site in the medieval period. An \\"unstratified sherd of late Saxon pottery hinted that iron working on the site may date back to the 10th or 11th centuries.

Length 53m, beam 8.6m, draft 3.7m. Powered by diesel engines, Holmbank was propelled by a single screw. When sailing in New Zealand, it was one of the first vessels on the New Zealand coast with a controllable pitch propeller.  Ownership and name changes  Holmbank was named Anne when launched in 1948, being renamed Sunny Girl the following year. Bought by a New Zealand company, the vessel was renamed Turihau in 1952, before finally being renamed Holmbank in 1962 when bought by Holme Shipping Company.  Voyages  Holmbank was employed in coastal trade throughout New Zealand from 1952 until 1963. Between 1952 and 1961, while named Turihau, the vessel was involved in four casualty incidents. In 1952 it struck a submerged rock off Tuahine Point. In 1954, damage was sustained while berthing in a gale in Auckland. In 1955 Holmbank struck twice on submerged rocks, first on Great Mercury Island, and later on Walker Rock, off Cape Jackson.  Final voyage  On 19 September 1963, Holmbank sailed from Timaru, bound for Wellington with 400 tons of general cargo. It had a crew numbering 16, and was commanded by a Captain Home. Around the southern coast of Banks Peninsula, Holmbank's course was calculated to pass within 2 miles of the Akaroa light.

She was known as the \\"Pastry Queen of Rhode Island,\\" particularly famous for her frosted plum cake.  Early life  The details of Quamino's early life are unclear. She may have been born in Senegal or Ghana, probably in 1739, though the year 1753 has also been suggested. Quamino identified herself as the daughter of an African prince, the origin of her name \\"Duchess\\" (sometimes spelled \\"Dutchess\\"), and was known for her royal bearing. She also went by the name Charity, which may have been her original name or a nickname. She was brought to Rhode Island as a child, on the slave ship Elizabeth. In 1750, she became the property of William and Lucy Channing, a prominent family in Newport, Rhode Island. She worked in their household as a cook and a nanny. Quamino converted to Christianity while working for the Channings, and was an active member of Ezra Stiles' congregation at Second Congregational Church, a white church which the Channings also attended. Most white churches required black attendees to sit in areas concealed by screens, where white attendees could not see them, including the town's Trinity Church, but Quamino was not concealed at Second Congregational. She was known as a pious person.  Marriage  In 1769, Duchess married John Quamino, who was enslaved by Captain Benjamin Church in Newport. During their marriage, they had a number of children. Charles was born in 1772, Violet in 1776, and Katharine Church in 1779. They also had a daughter named Cynthia. Three of their daughters died young: one at birth, one at age fifteen, and Violet at age 18 in 1792. The couple do not appear to have lived together. Their children lived with Quamino at the Channings' household. Her husband John won a lottery and bought his freedom in 1773, after which he attended the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University) to train as a missionary. During the American Revolutionary War, John left his religious vocation to serve as a privateer, in order to raise the money to buy the freedom of his wife and two daughters. However, he died in August 1779, making Duchess Quamino a widow at age forty.  Freedom  By 1780, Quamino was no longer enslaved. It has been said that the Channings manumitted her, but also that \\"she convinced [Channing] that the two races should be considered equal ‚Äî yet he did not free her.\\" Although there is no concrete evidence that she bought her own freedom, it is typically attributed to the success of her business. After being freed, Quamino continued to live with and work for the Channings, now being paid for her labor. Quamino worked as a nanny looking after William Ellery Channing, born in 1780, who would later become a Unitarian preacher. He remembered her fondly in his memoirs and considered her influential in his religious and abolitionist views. Quamino began her catering business from the Channings' house. She delivered cakes to customers and catered large public events. She became known for her specialty dish, a frosted plum cake. She catered at least once for George Washington. By 1782, Quamino eventually earned enough money to purchase her own home. She lived on School Street as a neighbor of Channing, and used the Channings' large oven for major baking projects. In 1792, Quamino became the first black woman invited to join a black male organization in New England, when she purchased a one-sixth share in the business of the Palls and Biers Society of the African Union. An an entrepreneur, she was a prosperous, respected, and well-connected figure in the community.  Death  Quamino died on June 29, 1804. A large funeral was held in her honor. She is buried in Newport‚Äôs Common Burying Ground, in the northern section known as \\"God‚Äôs Little Acre.\\" William Ellery Channing wrote the inscription for her gravestone: \\"In memory of Duchess Quamino, a free Black of distinguished excellence; Intelligent, industrious, affectionate, honest, and of exemplary piety; who deceased June 29, 1804, aged 65 years.\\" In 2017, Quamino's gravestone, and that of her daughter Violet, were restored.

He was the brother of mining engineer and Catholic theologian Franz Xaver von Baader. Life Born into an environment of relative wealth ‚Äì his father, Franz Joseph Baader, became Duke Clement of Bavaria's personal physician in 1768 ‚Äì he originally also pursued a career in medicine. However, following his graduation in 1785, he decided to shift to studies of mathematics and physics instead, widening his knowledge in these areas through a study trip to England from 1787‚Äì1795, where he worked as a civil engineer. After this period, he returned to Bavaria, where he joined the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1796. His theory of suction published in 1797 attracted the attention of the Elector Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, who in 1802 commissioned Baader with the creation of new fountains for the Nymphenburg Palace Park. In 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte called him to Paris, where he submitted plans for the development of a new engine for the Machine de Marly, though these were never realized. Starting in 1807, he began advocating for the construction of railway lines, his involvement in this cause going as far as to present a working model of a railcar in 1818, which he developed into a fully-sized machine in the following years. In 1815, Baader acquired the patent for a freight wagon that was able to travel by rail and road. In 1832, in order to develop the country to build a railway from Rosenheim via Miesbach, T√∂lz, Iffeldorf to Lechbruck and a canal from Iffeldorf to Lake Starnberg and on to Munich, Baader made a plea for a railway connection from Munich to Starnberg. In 1810, he invented what is hypothesized to have been the first modern pedal boat. He was raised to Bavarian nobility in 1813. Following the death of his daughter, Caroline, in 1834, von Baader's own health also began to deteriorate. He died on 20 November 1835.

On March 23, 1979, Rodriguez was taking photos on the corner of Whittier Boulevard and McDonnell Avenue in East Los Angeles for Lowrider Magazine and captured the assault of an innocent man by members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The last photo Rodriguez took was of a police officer pointing directly at him. Soon after, the officers attacked him, confiscated his camera and film, and beat him so badly that he spent three days in the Los Angeles County Hospital. While preparing to leave the hospital, Rodriguez was placed under arrest for allegedly assaulting the officers with a \\"deadly weapon.\\" Rodriguez suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and lost the ability to dream in the aftermath of the incident. From 1979 to 1986, Rodriguez sought justice in court for this incident, which involved two trials and eventually won his case. Rodriguez reported that he began to dream again 20 years following the event after drinking from a medicinal plant in Mexico. The fatal shooting of Michael Brown in 2014 inspired Rodriguez to retell his story and provide a platform for the stories of others who have suffered police brutality in Yolqui, a Warrior Summoned from the Spirit World: Testimonios on Violence (2019). Rodriguez supported students and spoke out at protests, governing board meetings, and other public hearings against the passing of Arizona House Bill 2281 led by Tom Horne, which banned the Mexican American Studies Department Programs and banned and confiscated books on Chicano history, critical race theory, and decoloniality in the Tucson Unified School District. He was arrested with local high school and college students the day the anti- Mexican-American studies legislation was signed into law. In response, Rodriguez stated that the ban was evidence that only \\"Greco-Roman Knowledge\\" was allowed in Arizona Schools and \\"that Indigenous peoples and Indigenous knowledge\\" have been \\"outlawed once again.\\" Rodriguez was attacked by the far- right for his vocal support of the Mexican American Studies Department Programs, which included a threat on his life.

Some of his notable works include the rooftop garden design for Shanghai Grand Cinema, the Japanese Garden of Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo, and the garden of Taiko- en.  Biography  = Early life = Hirofumi Suga was born on May 31, 1972 in Shakujii-koen, Tokyo. In an interview for \\"Green is...\\" magazine, Suga describes how when he was 18-years-old, his friend took him to visit gardens in Kyoto. He was so inspired by the temple gardens he saw there that he decided to pursue a career as a ‚Äúniwashi‚Äù, or Japanese-style gardener. During that time, he met the acclaimed ‚Äúniwashi‚Äù Kasai Tsutomu, who Suga greatly admired for his challenge to traditional methods in Japanese gardening. Suga would occasionally assist Kasai with his projects in order to learn from him. = Business/Career = right He first started working as a gardener for the Tokyo landscape firm Shinwa at the age of 17. After three years of working for the Tokyo firm, he went to work for another gardening firm in Kyoto called Murakami. In 1994, at 22-years-old, he started his own landscape design and construction firm called Ichimoku-Isseki, which later became known as 1Moku (pronounced ‚Äúichimoku‚Äù), currently located in Osaka, Japan. In the earlier years of his company, Suga mainly focused on private projects of garden and landscape designs. However, his lack of knowledge in construction and building requirements limited the extent of his craft, so he began studying in order to earn a degree in architecture. This allowed him to expand into larger areas of commercial landscaping and interior design that took into consideration the more fundamental uses and infrastructural limits of a space. Since its establishment, 1Moku has completed over 80 design and gardening projects of various scales all across Japan, including a number of international collaborations. In 2018, he established a second landscape design company called Tsubaki Studio in Barcelona, Spain.  Philosophical views  Traditionally, the role of a ‚Äúniwashi‚Äù in Japanese culture was considered an important and esteemed position within society. More than simply tending to or creating a garden, a ‚Äúniwashi‚Äù would incorporate a number of symbolic and spiritual components into their designs, including aspects of harmony, balance, use of nature, etc. As such, it is typical for even modern-day ‚Äúniwashi‚Äù to develop their own personal philosophies of design. In this respect, Suga‚Äôs personal philosophies are reminiscent of this traditional role and approach of the ‚Äúniwashi‚Äù. He strives to design with a holistic mindset, considering the entirety of the space so that both the garden aspect and the architecture aspect work harmoniously. He often sources traditional Japanese gardeners, like Jihei Ogawa, for his inspiration in creating ‚Äúmaster plan gardens‚Äù, which is the idea that the gardeners not only design the outside or leftover space, but analyze the land and space as a whole to enhance the value of the architecture. Suga also includes concepts of harmony with nature and surrounding fauna, combinations of traditional and modern methods, and the use of zen-style rock gardens in many of his projects in order to accomplish contemporary yet functional spaces for commercial or public use.

He was the last bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch until the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in the Netherlands in 1853. Life Bergaigne was born in Breda, in the Duchy of Brabant, on 1 May 1588, to a family of Italian descent that later moved to Antwerp.Jules de Saint-Genois, \\"Bergaigne (Joseph de)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 2 (Brussels, 1868), 175-176. He entered the Order of Friars Minor at an early age and was sent to study in Spain, where he obtained doctorates in both philosophy and theology, which he went on to teach in Cologne and Mainz. He became provincial of the Rhine province in 1616, and in 1618 definitor and commissioner general for Germany and the Low Countries. Emperor Ferdinand II entrusted him with a number of sensitive missions, including negotiations concerning the election of the future Emperor Ferdinand III as King of the Romans in 1636. In January 1638 he was appointed bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch. As the city had fallen to the Dutch in 1629, he was not able to enter his see. On 27 October 1641, he was consecrated bishop by Jacobus Boonen, and he exercised his authority as bishop as best he could from Geldrop. On 24 February 1645 he was elected archbishop of Cambrai, taking possession of the see by procuration on 27 July 1646.Honor√© Fisquet, La France pontificale (Gallia Christiana): Cambrai (Paris, √âtienne Repos, 1864), pp. 228-230. On Google Books. As Philip IV of Spain had appointed him his representative at the Congress of M√ºnster, he was unable to visit the see in person. He died in M√ºnster on 24 October 1647, before the conclusion of peace, but after having signed a commercial treaty with the Hanseatic League. He was buried in the Augustinian church there. Over a decade later, his family had his remains transferred to the Franciscan convent in Antwerp where they were reburied on 18 September 1663 in a service led by Ambrosius Capello.

Life  Born in Breckerfeld, Westphalia, Griesbach attended a Gymnasium in Hamburg and subsequently studied composition with Philipp Jarnach and conducting with Eugen K√∂rner at the Musikhochschule K√∂ln from 1937. After completing his studies in 1941 he served in the military in World War II and was taken prisoner of war by the Soviets in 1944, from which he was not released until 1949. The following year Griesbach settled in Dresden, where he lived until his death at age 83. In the years 1952 and 1953 he worked at a Berlin theater for a short time. He also wrote reviews and worked as a dramaturge at the Staatsoper Dresden. From 1952 to 1955 Griesbach taught at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber. From 1966 he worked there, first as a lecturer, from 1968 as professor of composition, until he retired from teaching in 1981. Griesbach was awarded, among others, the of the city of Dresden (1961), the Art Prize of the German Democratic Republic (1967) and the Patriotic Order of Merit (1976). Griesbach's wife Margrit appeared as a pianist and interpreted mainly works of her husband.  Music  Griesbach always tried to write music that was relatively easy to understand. For this reason he took up suggestions from B√©la Bart√≥k and also from Arnold Sch√∂nberg, but in the end he did not completely break with tonality and was, on the whole, a rather conservative composer for his generation. His music is characterized by a concise rhythm, rather rough timbres and concise forms. In his works, Griesbach sometimes referred to political themes. At the beginning of the 1960s he was interested in foreign musical cultures and was also inspired by blues and African music. His Afrikanische Sinfonie (African Symphony), composed at that time, was a considerable success. His main focus is on stage works. In the GDR and especially in Dresden Griesbach was a respected composer, but after the reunification he was largely forgotten.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The old town hall in Poplar High Street The building was commissioned to replace an aging mid-19th century municipal building with a distinctive octagonal tower and dome and mosaic detail on Poplar High Street which had been built in 1870. It had become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar in 1900. The old building on the High Street had been the scene of the Poplar Rates Rebellion, led by George Lansbury, which resulted in 19 councilors being put in prison in 1921. The council sold the old town hall to a developer in 2011 and it was subsequently converted into a hotel. In the 1930s civic leaders decided this arrangement was inadequate for their needs and that they would procure a new town hall: the site chosen for the new building had been occupied by a 19th century vestry hall. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the former mayor, Alderman Charles Key, on 8 May 1937. It was designed by Culpin and Son in the Moderist style in a shape that took the form of a trapezoid. The design involved a rounded frontage at the junction of Bow Road and Fairfield Road; there were layers of continuous stone facing panels above and below a continuous band of glazing on the first, second and third floors. The Builders, a frieze by sculptor David Evans on the face of the building, was unveiled by Lansbury at the official opening of the building on 10 December 1938. The Portland Stone panels commemorated the trades constructing the town hall and symbolised the borough's relationship with the River Thames and the youth of Poplar.Public Monument & Sculpture Association date accessed 1 April 2007 The principal rooms were the council chamber, the mayor's parlour and an assembly hall which benefited from a sprung Canadian maple dance floor. The building was proclaimed by the council to be the first town hall to be erected in the modernist style but ceased to function as the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Tower Hamlets was formed in 1965. After being used as workspace by the council until the mid-1980s, the town hall was sold in the 1990s to a developer who added a roof extension and converted it for commercial use. It was subsequently used as a business centre.

The game also features elements from the real- time strategy genre. It was released in June 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Gameplay The game is played from a first- person perspective. The player assumes control of Romer Shoal, a Gravcycle pilot. The Gravcycle can hover above the ground and from this position, Romer can issue commands to his four-person squad and activate their abilities while providing aerial support. The Gravcycle in the game has three distinct models, with each granting players different advantages. For instance, Heavy can launch strong attacks but it moves at a slower pace. Romer can use his Gravcycle to highlight different areas of interest and resources, which can be salvaged to upgrade the Gravcycle, the ground units, and his own upgrade chip. The game's multiplayer modes can support up to 10 players. In multiplayer, the player can choose to command a crew, which consists of a gravcycle and several ground units. At launch, players can choose from nine crews. Each crew has their own gameplay characteristics and unique abilities. Story The game takes place 150 years into the future. Following a complete collapse of society due to climate change, a group of scientists develops a technique to transfer the human brain into a robotic body in order to reduce the demands placed on Earth's resources, which comes to be known as \\"integration\\". While integration is only temporary in nature, a militant group named Rayonne emerged to become a superpower and began forcing all humans to conform to the integration process. The game follows a group of outlaws, led by Romer Shoal, who had already \\"integrated\\", as they rebel against Rayonne and attempt to \\"reboot humanity\\". Development The game was directed by Marcus Lehto, the co-creator of the Halo series. It is the debut title for his studio, V1 Interactive, which employed 30 employees. While Lehto first began brainstorming ideas for the game in 2014, the actual development took around three and a half years. Initially, the team envisioned the game as a real-time strategy (RTS) title, though he felt that the gameplay was not unique enough. Therefore, Lehto decided to incorporate elements of first-person shooter into the game by converting the RTS camera into an active participant in combat. Myth was one of the games that inspired Lehto when he was designing the gameplay. The game's musical score was composed by Jon Everist, who previously worked on Battletech. Talking about the process, Everist worked closely with the lead audio director and ensured that his music blended well with the gameplay and cinematics, owing to relying on character themes and suites as a basis for the score. Private Division announced that it would publish the game in December 2017. It was officially announced in July 2019. A multiplayer beta was released in January 2020, lasting for two days. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on June 16, 2020. The game's multiplayer support will be completely removed on November 17, 2020, less than six months after the game's initial release. According to V1 Interactive, \\"the game unfortunately struggled to build a significant audience necessary for a compelling multiplayer experience\\".

Initially, the workhouse was located on the north side of Featherstone Street, Bunhill Fields, it having opened in 1724. Being within part of the City of London parish of St Giles without Cripplegate, it fell under the control of two metropolitan authorities. The lease expired in 1782 and a second Local Act enabled the parish to build the new workhouse at a cost of ¬£2,000. Once built, the site consisted of wards, a workshop and a vestry hall. It then fell within the Borough of Finsbury before boundaries were realigned. St. Luke's became the Holborn and Finsbury Institution and then St. Matthews Hospital, when the site was converted to house sick patients. World War II bomb damage destroyed the southernmost block, which was never fully repaired. The vestry hall was sold to the London and Provincial Assurance Company before being demolished in the 1960s. The hospital was closed in 1986. The workshops straddling Shepherdess Walk were renovated and are now modern apartments whilst the wards straddling Wellesley Terrace appear largely original, them too having been sold and converted to apartments.

It marks the north-western entrance to Galway Bay and the port of Galway known as the North Sound. Due to its location it is also known as the Aran North Lighthouse. The lighthouse on Inisheer at the south-eastern end of the islands was also constructed at the same time. Eeragh and Inisheer both became operational in 1857. History The first lighthouse on the Aran Islands was built in 1818 on Inishmore near Dun Oghil, but it became apparent that it was poorly positioned. Firstly, because it could not be seen at the hazardous ends of the Aran Islands chain, where the North and South Sound approaches were located, and secondly, its location on the highest point of the island also meant it could be obscured in poor weather conditions. Requests from the Revenue Commissioners to the Ballast Board, the predecessor of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to relocate the light went unheeded. But in 1850 the Galway Harbour Commissioners asked the Board to construct a new lighthouse at the north-west end of the islands. To meet this request, it was determined that the best approach was to construct two lighthouses, one on Eeragh and the other, the Inisheer Lighthouse, at the south-eastern end of the island chain. The design of both lights was carried out by George Halpin Junior with construction starting in 1853. They were commissioned on December 1, 1857, with the Inishmore light being deactivated that same date. Daniel Crowe & Sons of Dublin constructed both lighthouses and associated buildings, the cost for Eeragh was ¬£15,126.1s.7d. (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) with Inisheer being ¬£14,252.2s.4d (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) Operation Eeragh inherited the light characteristic from the Inishmore light of a 30s flash in a period of 3 minutes, using a flashing optic system from Wilkins of London, whereas Inisheer originally displayed a fixed white light using a Chance Brothers optic. In 1904 a new optic was installed which used vaporized paraffin. In 1958 the characteristic was changed to a 1.2 second flash every 15 seconds. Following automation of the lighthouse in 1978, when the optics were replaced again, a number of different power sources were used to power the light. These included a Thermomechanical generator (TMG) which provided electricity to power the batteries for the revolving lamps, with a backup diesel generator. The TMG proved to be very useful in maintaining the battery charge, but its maintenance overheads meant that it was eventually replaced with a wind generator in 1983. In 2006 the light was switched to one powered by solar panels and its range reduced to 18 nautical miles. The tower made of tough limestone was originally painted white with two red bands, but in 1932 the bands were painted black. Listed buildings The lighthouse tower and associated houses are all listed within the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, where it is noted ‚ÄúThis lighthouse, with its typically flared walls and roof lantern, performed the critical function of safeguarding mariners along the coast around the west end of Aran. The accompanying lighthouse keepers' houses complete an interesting ensemble of maritime heritage interest.‚Äù  See also  * List of lighthouses in Ireland  References  Lighthouses completed in 1857 Lighthouses in the Republic of Ireland Lighthouses on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage ","title":"Eeragh Lighthouse"},{"id":"63964366","text":"Sukhaya Beryozovka () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Sukho-Beryozovskoye Rural Settlement, Bobrovsky District, Voronezh Oblast, Russia.

The upper layers of the mountain are made up of extrusive rocks, which formed at the surface. A succession of lava flows form the bulk of these upper layers. Some solidified mudflows are also present. The rock that forms Round Top was more resistant to erosion than other strata of the volcano. Eventually, over a geologic time scale, these other strata wore away, revealing the erosion-resistant remnants which make up the mountain that remains today. Ecology The north slope of Round Top is home to a number of tree species, most prominently whitebark pine, western white pine, and lodgepole pine. The summit of the mountain rises above the tree line. Western white pine and lodgepole pine grow up to about . The whitebark pine survives in the form of short, stubby krummholz to as high as . A specimen of the Lake Tahoe lupine (Lupinus meionanthus) has been identified at the summit of Round Top. History In 1872, prospectors began exploring the Summit City Creek canyon immediately south of Round Top, ultimately filing more than 30 mining claims in the area. At some point before 1879, George Davidson of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey established a geodetic station on the summit of the mountain, as part of a chain of such stations atop peaks along the Sierra crest. Climbing Round Top is listed on the Sierra Peaks Section peak list. Reaching the summit requires a class 3 ascent. The circumstances of the first ascent are unknown.

According to the evidence from the Saint Agathiyar‚Äôs work \\"Agathiyar-12000\\" and the Saint Bogar's work \\"Bogar - 7000\\", Karuvurar was descended from a noble Vishwakarma Brahmin family. His parents were in the hereditary business of forging idols out of metals and alloys. The parents of Karuvoorar Siddhar were dedicated to creating temple idols, by visiting various places of purity and divine significance, while architecting idols by forging the nine metals, and they honed these skills to make a livelihood. So naturally Karuvurar Siddhar excelled as an alchemist. For some time, he also engaged in the business of doing sculpture work, and developed various god‚Äôs idol through his expert knowledge in the art of sculpting the divine idols as per the evidence from Agathiyar's work \\"Agathiyar-12000\\" verse 466.

The saint Bogar came and instructed the king to release his disciple karuvurar and he is ready to give the gold for compensation. The king and the saint Bogar went to the prison to release Karuvurar. He was nowhere in the cell.

Life Guillaume was born in Amiens, France, on 5 March 1812. He was living in Charleroi when the Belgian Revolution broke out in 1830, and immediately joined the revolutionary forces, becoming secretary to L√©onard Greindl (a future minister of war) just as the surrender of the Dutch garrison in Charleroi was being negotiated.Albert Duchesne, \\"Guillaume (Gustave)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 38 (Brussels, 1973), 289-293. On 20 October he was appointed second lieutenant in the 3rd Regiment of the Line. In 1837 Guillaume transferred to the 8th Regiment of the Line with the rank of captain (second class), and the following year to the newly formed Grenadier Regiment. On 27 November 1843 he was sent the Royal Military Academy, and on 19 July 1845 promoted to captain (first class). On 23 June 1846 he was seconded to the military personnel department of the Ministry of War. He was promoted to the rank of major on 6 April 1849, lieutenant-colonel on 24 June 1853, colonel on 1 August 1855, and major general on 15 July 1863, despite never having had effective command of more than a company. In 1851 he had married the 19-year-old C√©cile-Antoinette Engler. They would have three sons. Guillaume was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium on 9 May 1860, and a full member on 6 May 1867. From 1865 he sat on the editorial committee of the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, which he chaired from 1869 to 1877. In 1875 he became director of the Academy's \\"Classe des Lettres et des Sciences morales et politiques\\". Guillaume resigned from the ministry on 3 January 1868 to take up a position as aide de camp to King Leopold II. Up to 1872 he was involved in royal projects for the expansion of Belgian trade with China and Japan. In July 1870 he was appointed Minister of War in the government led by Jules d'Anethan, in the midst of the international crisis of the Franco-Prussian War. The Belgian Army was mobilised on 15 July to prevent incursions into Belgian territory by either side in the conflict, only returning to a peace footing on 3 March 1871. Guillaume was raised to the rank of lieutenant general on 20 March. He continued as minister under Barth√©l√©my de Theux de Meylandt, pushing for the government to abolish the system of remplacement that allowed wealthy conscripts to pay for somebody else to serve in their place. His failure to obtain reform of the conscription law led to his resignation from the government on 10 December 1872. He remained in place as acting minister until his successor was appointed the following year. He was ennobled by letters patent of 20 January 1873, and briefly served as head of the War College within the Royal Military Academy. He retired from the army on 14 May 1877.

The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The railway tunnel is part of the Glenbrook 1913 double-track deviation, which replaced the Glenbrook 1892 single-track deviation across the Blue Mountains. The tunnel is long and was officially opened on 11 May 1913.  Description At , the 1913 tunnel was shorter than the 1892 Glenbrook Tunnel. However, the 1913 deviation was approximately longer than the 1892 deviation. The 1913 deviation did not improve the time taken to climb or descend the pass between Emu Plains and Blaxland stations, however a reduction in gradient from 1:30 to 1:60 made the pass more manageable and reduced challenges with steam locomotives in tunnels on significant gradients, including reducing the possibility of suffocation. Initially it was planned to continue use of the 1892 tunnel for trains that head east from the Blue Mountains towards Emu Plains station. When the deviation opened in May 1913, the single-track 1892 tunnel, with a gradient of 1:30, was used for east-bound trains and the new 1913 tunnel, with a gradient of 1:60, was used for west-bound trains. After the new line duplication was completed on 25 September 1913, the old (1892) Glenbrook Tunnel was no longer used for trains and the old Glenbrook station was closed. Steel sleepers were used instead of traditional wooden sleepers. Electricity supplied power to the tunnel for lighting and electric fans used to maintain air quality. The improvements to the Main Western Line resulted in rapid development of the Blue Mountains area as both a residential and tourism destination.  Slab track  The track through the tunnel is located on a 300m radius curve. The track through this tunnel was eventually converted to so-called Slab track whereby the ballast was replaced by a concrete slab. This would have improved clearances inside the tunnel. But slab track created a new problems, namely that the slab track was stiffer than the ballasted track that adjoined it, and a transition was needed between the two stiffness levels. The transition was implemented by installing two extra \\"check rails\\" extending, say, 20m into the tunnel and 20m along the ballasted track. This created its own problem in that the last 20m of ballasted track was difficult to tamp because of the extra rails.

The CISAR is under unified coordination and command of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and comprises China Earthquake Administration, National Earthquake Response Support Service Centre, the 82nd brigade of the 82nd Group Army of Chinese People's Liberation Army, and 301 Hospital (or People's Liberation Army General Hospital. The whole team has 480 members, and is the first and the only national professional earthquake search and rescue team.  History  2003 Boumerd√®s earthquake. The CISAR was dispatched for search and rescue abroad for the first time. In 2000, the then Vice Premier of the PRC State Council Wen Jiabao proposed, \\"We should establish three systems for earthquake prevention and disaster mitigation: monitoring and forecasting system, earthquake disaster defense system, and emergency rescue system. For the first two, we have owned well-developed systems. One of the significant measures to establish the third system is to create a professional team, that is, organize the first and only professional national search and rescue team.\\" In the same year, the preparation of the CISAR started, with the goal of building a \\"national earthquake search and rescue team with quick response, high flexibility and strong mobility\\". In December 2000, upon the approval of the PRC State Council and the PRC Central Military Commission, the General Office of the State Council issued the CISAR Construction Scheme and agreed the building of the CISAR. At first, the authorized number of team members was 222, consisting of people from the China Earthquake Administration, engineer corps of the 38nd Group Army and General Hospital of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces. On 27 April 2001, a ceremony was held for the establishment of the CISAR. The then Vice Premier Wen Jiabao presented a flag to the CISAR. On 3 July, the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department and China Earthquake Administration jointly held a \\"Joint Meeting of Onsite Working Team Leaders for Earthquake Disasters\\", at which a joint meeting system for major events was established to coordinate relevant national earthquake search and rescue teams and polices concerning earthquake search and rescue. In 2003, the CISAR developed its ability to search and rescue and was put into use officially. On 24 February, the team was assigned by the Chinese Central Government to severely-afflicted Maralbexi County for search and rescue after an earthquake broke out in Payzawat County, Xinjiang Province. This was the first time for the team to carry on a search and rescue task. On 22 May, the second day after the 2003 MW 6.8 Boumerd√®s earthquake, the CISAR took a flight to the epicentre Boumerd√®s Province for support and successfully saved one survivor. This was the first time for the team to perform a task abroad. On 28 August 2004, the National Earthquake Response Support Service centre was set up. It is responsible for onsite search and rescue, material management and onsite monitoring when an earthquake broke out and assumed the function of being a member and supporting the CISAR. In November 2009, the CISAR passed the Insarag External Classification (IEC) for UN search and rescue organisations and was authenticated as an international heavy search and rescue team. It then became the second UN heavy search and rescue team in Asia and the first in China. In June 2010, the China Earthquake Administration announced that the CISAR had been enlarged with its number of members increasing from 220 to around 480. In August 2014, the CISAR passed the \\"IEC\\" reassessment and again secured its qualification as an international heavy search and rescue team.  Search and rescue ability  The CISAR can finish equipment and supplies gathering in 2 to 3 hours after the earthquake, arrive at the earthquake-stricken area in 48 hours, and carry out search and rescue simultaneously in three cities under complicated conditions. Besides, it is able to perform search and rescue simultaneously in 9 general towns or 18 operation sites, and to set up an onsite coordination and action reception centre during its international search and rescue actions. The team is modularized while remaining manoeuvrable, so that it can be divided into three independent heavy search and rescue teams or several search and rescue detachments, and medical detachments with different functions. Aiming to \\"quickly search and rescue people buried in damaged constructions and buildings due to earthquake or other disasters\\", the team is mainly responsible for assisting the disaster area with first aid, preventive healthcare, search and rescue and post-earthquake restoration and reconstruction. Since its establishment in 2001, the CISAR has participated in more than 20 earthquake search and rescue tasks. As of May 2017, it has performed 19 tasks, saved 67 survivors, cleared more than 3,000 dead bodies, helped other teams confirm more than 400 survivors, and gave medical treatment to more than 40,000 injured people. The tasks included the 2003 Bumirdass Earthquake, 2003 Zhaosu Earthquake, 2003 Bam Earthquake, 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake, and 2005 Kashmir Earthquake, 2006 Indonesian Banda Sea Earthquake, Wenchuan Earthquake, 2010 Yushu Earthquake, 2010 Pakistan Floods, 2010 Haiti Earthquake, 2010 Pichi Lemu Earthquake in Chile, 2011 Christchurch Earthquake, 2011 Northeast Japan Pacific Offshore Earthquake, 2014 Ludian Earthquake, Nepal Earthquake in April 2015, 2017 Jiuzhaigou Earthquake and so forth. The CISAR possesses more than 2,000 rescue equipment such as optical sound wave detectors, sound wave detectors, infrared detectors, hydraulic pliers, moon lamps, airbags, search and rescue dogs, maritime satellite phones, etc. The team is equipped with three RW3 large rescue vehicles, three trailer-type container rescue vehicles, several satellite cluster communication vehicles and command vehicles. The large rescue vehicle is loaded with 280 sets of equipment, including sonic life search instrument, hydraulic power station, gas cylinder respirator, vehicle-mounted generator, etc. Each vehicle allows a detachment of 60 to 70 people to carry out search and rescue work at the same time on two operating surfaces. The CISAR medical detachment is equipped with medical devices such as emergency medical vehicles, net-type tents, portable ventilators, Dash3000 monitors, Lifepak20 defibrillators, electrocardiographs, and field operation beds. After entering the earthquake zone, the mobile hospital of CISAR is able to carry out medical aid in six field emergency units, including the command unit, classified disposal unit, critical illness emergency unit, surgical treatment unit, inspection and test unit, and pharmaceutical equipment unit. According to the experience of the CISAR in earthquake relief, about 80% of the victims will suffer psychological trauma after strong earthquakes, so the medical team has arranged specialized psychological intervention experts to take charge of related matters.  Staffing  CISAR usually takes China International Airlines charter flights to perform rescue missions overseas. The picture shows the B-6076, the national flight plane boarded by the CISAR during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. The CISAR requires \\"quick response, high flexibility and strong mobility, and the ability to perform emergency rescue tasks at any time\\". It has the capabilities of performing management, support, search, rescue, medical rescue and disaster assessment. The team consists of experts from the China Earthquake Administration who are responsible for earthquakes, engineering structures, and dangerous goods, liaisons familiar with the UN's rescue affairs, emergency medical personnel from the General Hospital of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, and professional rescuers from engineer corps of the People's Liberation Army. The National Earthquake Emergency Rescue and Research Team (China International Search and Rescue Team) is organized as a general team, subordinating three detachments and a direct team. The detachment is divided into search unit, rescue unit, medical unit, technical unit and support unit. The direct team consists of the staff officer group, technical group, and security group. The CISAR can be staffed as a 16, 27, 48, or 67 team according to needs. The CISAR is under the leadership of the State Council and the Central Military Commission, with the Joint Meeting of Onsite Working Team Leaders for Earthquake Disasters as the coordinating and managerial body. The Joint Meeting Office is located at the China Earthquake Emergency Search and Rescue Centre. According to the requirements of the China Earthquake Administration and the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, the Joint Meeting is responsible for reviewing the rescue team formation plan, development plan, annual work plan, annual and major expenditure plans; reviewing technical rescue standards, training programs, training outline, training base construction plan and international exchanges; reviewing and approving rescue equipment configuration plan, procurement plan and other significant issues. The Joint Meeting Office is responsible for the preparation of development plans, the formulation of action plans, the organization of personnel training, and the management of personnel appointments of the CISAR. The China Earthquake Emergency Search and Rescue Centre is the composition and supporting unit of CISAR. The Search and Rescue Centre undertakes tasks such as the research and development of earthquake emergency rescue technologies, information services, equipment support, and personnel training at home and abroad, and acts as the business leading and technical guiding body of the People's Republic of China in the field of earthquake emergency rescue. In order to conduct professional skill training for rescue team members, the Search and Rescue Centre established a National Earthquake Emergency Rescue Training Base in Fenghuangling, Haidian District, Beijing. The training base covers an area of 194 acres, and the ruin training ground covers an area of 6,700 square meters. The base can provide emergency management personnel with simulation training and drills in command scheduling and plan deduction, and provide rescue personnel with comprehensive practical training such as building collapse rescue, secondary disaster rescue, and counter-terrorism drills. Among the members of CISAR, search and rescue members account for the largest proportion, reaching about 300 people. The rescue team members are from the 82nd engineer brigade of the 82nd Group Army of Chinese People's Liberation Army. Active soldiers shall undertake emergency rescue work by combining peacetime with wartime operations. At the same time, the search and rescue dog team of CISAR, the first professional team of its kind in mainland China, has more than 40 search and rescue dogs. The medical personnel of CISAR is dispatched by the Third Medical Centre of the People's Liberation Army General Hospital (301 Hospital), including doctors from departments such as emergency, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, dermatology, laboratory and anaesthesiology, responsible for providing medical services for victims in the earthquake-stricken area, and providing medical protection for rescue team members. In 2005, the CISAR Mobile Hospital was formally established, and since then, it provides relevant medical personnel with two months of full- time emergency rescue training and exercises every year.

The events of the story immediately follow those of his 1939 novel Gale Warning in which Richard Chandos and Jonathan Mansel appear as characters. The book was published in the US under the title Were Death Denied.  Plot  The novel is largely set in the countryside around Pau, in South-West France, although Dieppe, Chartres and Vend√¥me also feature. Chandos and Mansel interfere with a gang robbery at Biarritz, and are hunted down with murderous intent by the gang's leader, Daniel Gedge (a.k.a. \\"Auntie Emma\\", previously bested by Mansel in Ad√®le and Co.). Characters familiar from earlier books include Jenny Chandos, John and Audrey Bagot, Carson, Bell, Rowley, Toby Rage, and the minor villain Punter. Other villains include the fallen scholar Brevet, counterfeiter Baron Horace de Parol (owner of the Ch√¢teau of Arx), and his niece, Mona Lelong, a.k.a. \\"The Stoat\\". The latter changes sides and helps Chandos escape capture through a series of partly-flooded caverns lying underneath the chateau.  Background  Red in the Morning was written rapidly by Mercer, who needed at this stage in his life to ensure he remained in the ranks of best-selling authors. Much of his private fortune was tied up in his house \\"Cockade\\", south of Pau (the building of which was described in his novel of the year before, The House That Berry Built) and it was becoming increasingly likely that he and his wife would be unable to live there after the war.  Critical reception  US edition Although the war meant that the book could not be printed in the same quantities as previous books, it was still highly successful for the time. It shows no signs of having been written rapidly, and many followers of Mercer consider it to be one of his best.

Founded in 2012, and based in Chicago, the company has been funded by a series of federal agencies in the United States (National Science Foundation, Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration) since 2013 and began taking venture capital financing backed by the likes of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg, Al Gore and Richard Branson in 2019. As of 2020, the company aims to serve a range of consumer and industrial applications with its protein production platform, including microbial manufacturing needs as well as other space travel uses for NASA. Its protein products are fungus-based rather than plant- or animal-based.  Company and product history  In 2009, co-founder and CSO Mark Kozubal was on a NASA-funded extreme environments study of life that uncovered the \\"Fy\\" protein derived from a microbe, Fusarium strain flavolapis, in Yellowstone National Park's geothermal springs in the Yellowstone Supervolcano. The purpose of the NASA-funded study was to prepare to send a space probe to search for life on other planets. While still a postdoctoral researcher in February 2012, Kozubal determined that the acidophilic fungus, originally dubbed MK7, now Fusarium strain flavolapis, that he found could be converted into a lipid that could be converted into biodiesel. The company was founded on November 13, 2012 as Sustainable Bioproducts LLC. Sustainable Bioproducts partnered with Montana State University in 2013 to understand the marketplace fit of MK7, and it has a profit-sharing agreement with Yellowstone in exchange for the right to harvest from its land. It has been funded by SBIR grants from numerous federal agencies: National Science Foundation (Phase I $149,848 in 2013 and Phase II $620,779 in 2014), Department of Agriculture (Phase I $99,989 in 2014), Environmental Protection Agency (Phase I $99,944 in 2014 and Phase II $300,000 in 2015), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Phase I $123,809 in 2018 and Phase II $749,939 in 2020), Jonas and Kozubal originally teamed up on an effort to use \\"Fy\\" to develop a more efficient biofuel but pivoted to food. At one point the company was focused on converting biological waste. CEO and co-founder Thomas Jonas now describes Fy as a ‚Äúresilient, thrifty little bugger,‚Äù when discussing its potential as a protein source. On February 4, 2019, Sustainable Bioproducts announced a $33-million Series A funding round led by Silicon Valley venture firm 1955 Capital. The round was backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a $1 billion fund led by Bill Gates with additional backing from Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg and Richard Branson as well as ADM Ventures, the venture arm of Archer Daniels Midland; Danone Manifesto Ventures, the venture arm of Danone; Lauder Partners; and the Liebelson family office. At the time of its Series A, the 22-employee company was based out of the University of Chicago's Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and believed itself to be two years from commercialization of its solid, liquid or powder products. The company uses a fermentation process on microbes sourced in Yellowstone National Park that can survive extreme environments. Its competitors in the lab-grown meat space include Memphis Meats, Geltor, Perfect Day and Finless Foods. In March 2020, Sustainable Bioproducts rebranded as Nature's Fynd and closed an $80-million Series B round that enabled it to move into a plant in the Back of the Yards neighborhood near the old Union Stock Yard to produce its geothermal springs- sourced microbe-based product, which has a more efficient production rate and more complete protein than its competitors, and that will join kombucha in the newly evolving fermented consumables category to leverage the consumer appeal of the \\"found in nature\\" designation. The Series B round was done to capitalize on the hot market for funding alternative protein and protein sources. At the time of the Series B round, which was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Al Gore's Generation Investment Management LLP, Nature's Fynd employed 50 people in the new Chicago production center and research & development office in Bozeman, Montana. The company expected to have 100 employees by the end of 2020. The Chicago production facility was built out with the aim of producing branded consumer products such as animal-free cream cheese, chicken nuggets, beef sliders, pork dumplings and chocolate mousse. Meanwhile, the GRAS application was underway and as were product labeling efforts regarding the microbial fermented protein that is fungus-based rather than animal- or plant-based.

Science MK7 was originally known as a fungus that consumed algae, produced a lipid byproduct and upon drying it exuded oil. \\"Fy\\", which is short for Fusarium str. yellowstonensis, contains a complete protein (has all nine essential amino acids needed for human nutrition) that is believed to have potential use in meatless burgers, dairy substitutes and protein powders. Unlike many alternative proteins, it is itself a food rather than a protein additive to complement other processed ingredients. Sometimes called Fusarium Spp, the branching network of mycelial filaments forms a proteinaceous facsimile of meat without so much as a bioreactor in open trays with basic post processing (drying, pressing, and flavoring). The process uses propagation of extremophiles rather than bioengineering, resulting in an end product that is mostly protein with fibers, and oils as well as micronutrients vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron and calcium rather than a substance from which to gather a protein extract. The fermentation is fueled by starches and simple sugars. The fungus-based protein process is far more efficient than either plant-based or animal-based proteins with a season-agnostic biomass doubling time that is measured in hours and is not resource-intensive. Since the process takes 3.5 days, a single baking sheet can produce the equivalent of 30 chickens per year. Thus, the microbial manufacturing has potential to serve untapped opportunity in the developing world and solve significant supply problem for countries like China, and in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The company is working with NASA to develop a bioreactor that will employ the Fy microbe in space travel.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, members of the family assumed important offices within the princely chancellery of the Principality.  Origins  The family is mentioned for the first time in Romanian documents in a charter from 22 September 1411, when the sons of Soldan the Old receive from the prince of Moldavia important feudal domains on the »òomuz valley. In the charter, Alexander the Good offers to Peter Soldan, his wife (the daughter of boyar Ghiulea Capitaneus, captain of the Moldavian army) and to his brother, Miclaus, the Tatar slave villages at Tam√¢rtƒÉ»ôƒÉu»õi on the »òomuz.Ta»ôcƒÉ, George Felix. ‚ÄûDin cei ce au fost Paharnicul lliia»ô fiul lui Dumitru. √én sfatul »öƒÉrii Moldovei intre anii 1407 - 1429\\". Revista Carpica XXVI 1997, p. 8 The estate is called from that moment onwards »òoldƒÉne»ôti. At the same time, Peter and Miclaus Soldan are the first known slave owners in Moldavia in Wallachia. Later on, the family receives numerous privileges and lands, holding estates in Neam»õ, Suceava, Boto»ôani and Bessarabia. Nicolae Iorga believes that the Soldan family were originally Hungarian nobles who settled in Moldavia from Transylvania together with the first prince of independent Moldavia, Bogdan I, and then Romanised their name. Historians Radu Rosetti and Gheorghe GhibƒÉnescu also argue that in the charter from 1411 the family name is written before the first name, this being a custom only in Hungarian documents. Moreover, the first name of Peter‚Äôs brother, Miclaus, could come from the Hungarian form of Nicholas, which is Mikl√≥s. Rosetti is thus convinced that the Soldans were Hungarians from the Maramure»ô region. However, noble families with the name Soldan can also be found in Prussia and Sweden, so a possible German origin of the family should not be excluded. The family might have first become Hungarian in Maramure»ô and then Romanian in Moldavia. The family‚Äôs seal and coat of arms is represented by a lion.  Family members and alliances  For about four centuries, the Soldan family was one of the most important aristocratic (boyar) families in Moldavia. Important members of the family were PƒÉtra»ôco »òoldan, Great Chancellor of Moldavia; Dumitra»ôco »òoldan, Great Vornic; Vasile »òoldan, Great Treasurer of Moldavia. Through marriage alliances, the family connected with princely families such as Racovi»õƒÉ, Lupu, Cantacuzino and MovilƒÉ. Dumitru »òoldan was Vornic (administrator of justice) in the time of prince Petru Rare»ô, being one of his closest boyars. The proof is the financial support Dumitru offered to the prince in order to build Probota monastery, Petru Rare»ô‚Äô princely necropolis. In 1530, as it is written in the monastery‚Äôs inauguration charter, Dumitru paid for the princely house located within the monastery and for one of the towers. PƒÉtra»ôco Soldan, Great Logothete (Great Chancellor) of Moldavia between 1603 and 1610, was probably the son of Dumitru »òoldan and he was married to Antimia, related to the Greek noble Gheorghe Kataratos. They had together eight children: Anghelina, Teofana (married in the princely family Racovi»õƒÉ), Dumitra»ôco, Todera»ôco, Candachia, Catrina (married with the Great Treasurer Iordache Cantacuzino), Todo»ôca, and Tudosia (married to the Chief of Soroca). Appointed Great Logothete by prince Ieremia MovilƒÉ, PƒÉtra»ôco supports after his death the accession to the throne of Ieremia‚Äôs son, Constantin. Despite his very young age, Constantin is elected prince with the help of PƒÉtra»ôco. Dumitra»ôco »òoldan, PƒÉtra»ôco‚Äôs son, has held some of the most important offices of the Moldavian medieval state. He was appointed Steward between 1626-1631, High Steward from 1632 onwards, Great SpƒÉtar (Great Master of Ceremonies and Commander in Chief of the Army), Great Vornic of the Lower Country between 1636-1641 and Great Treasurer from 1642 until his death. He increased the prestige of his family even further by marrying princess Safta Caraiman, whose mother was a direct descendant of prince Stephen the Great. Together they had three children: Alexandra, Tofana, and Stephen, who would become Vornic of Moldavia under prince Vasile Lupu. During his time as Great Vornic, Dumitra»ôco grants Vasile Lupu estates in the county of Suceava in order to support the first princely academy at Trei Ierarhi in Ia»ôi. Moreover, together with princess Safta, he built the defence walls of in 1631 and the ceremony house and a tower at P√¢ngƒÉra»õi monastery in 1642. After their deaths, they were buried at their estate in »òoldƒÉne»ôti. Dumitra»ôco Soldan was also one of Vasile Lupu‚Äôs most trustworthy diplomats and military commanders. In 1637, Vasile Lupu invades Wallachia, ruled by his rival, Matei Basarab. Fearful that Vasile Lupu might take over Wallachia and then aim at Transylvania, George I R√°k√≥czi helps Wallachia to reject Lupu‚Äôs attack. Seeing that the two princes allied against him, Vasile Lupu fears an invasion from the West, so he sends Dumitra»ôco »òoldan to protect the border with Transylvania and he is appointed Protector of Oituz fortress, with a high strategic value. R√°k√≥czi quits his attack plans and, one year later, he seeks peace with both Romanian princes. Vornic Dumitra»ôco »òoldan was sent as Moldavia‚Äôs chief peace negotiator with the mission to close an alliance with the prince of Transylvania. Even if the peace negotiations between Moldavia and Wallachia fail, R√°k√≥czi agrees with the alliance between him and Vasile Lupu, pledging to help each other in case of foreign invasions. Todera»ôco »òoldan, Dumitra»ôco‚Äôs brother, was appointed Logothete in Moldova‚Äôs Chancellery in 1635 and he was later made Vornic of Boto»ôani between 1639-1642, being the first boyar with this title. Candachia »òoldan was the wife of Costea Bucioc, Moldavia‚Äôs chief military commander who fought with the Poles against Ottoman rule. After the defeat at the Battle of Cecora in 1620, he was taken prisoner and impaled by the Turks. Their daughter, Tudo»ôca Costea »òoldan, was the first wife of prince Vasile Lupu. In their turn, Todo»ôca Costea »òoldan and Vasile Lupu had two daughters: Maria, married to the Polish prince Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Court Chamberlain of Lithuania and Voivode of Vilna Voivodeship; and Ruxandra, mother of Catrina, married into the former Byzantine imperial family of the Cantacuzino.  Downfall  In Descriptio Moldavie, a chronicle of Moldavia, prince Dimitrie Cantemir mentions all seventy five noble families representing the ruling class of Moldavia, the »òoldans still being among them at the beginning of the 18th century. Indeed, in the late 17th-early 18th centuries, members of the »òoldan family were still holding important offices within the country‚Äôs government: Todera»ôcu »òoldan was Vornic of Boto»ôani; »òtefan »òoldan was Treasurer; Simion »òoldan was Vornic; Nicolae »òoldan was Postelnic (Chamberlain). However, as the Phanariot regime was imposed by the Ottoman rule, local elites started to be oppressed and old boyar families begin to decay. In 1717, in the context of an Austro-Turkish war, Moldavian noblemen are forced to choose between Ottoman rule, represented by prince Mihai Racovi»õƒÉ, and a western, Christian governance within the Holy Roman Empire which desired an expansion eastward. Chamberlain Nicolae »òoldan, together with two other high-ranking boyars and with the support of the Austrian army, start a riot against Racovi»õƒÉ. Many young noblemen, oriented towards the West rather than towards the Ottoman Empire, joined the rebellion against the Moldavian prince. However, the riot was crushed. In a last attempt to force Racovi»õƒÉ to abandon the throne, Nicolae »òoldan kidnaps his sister and sends her to Kronstadt as the prisoner of the Austrian army.

Administratively attached to the municipality of Varennes, located in the Marguerite-D'Youville Regional County Municipality, in Mont√©r√©gie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. This island has an area of approximately , making it the fifth most extensive island in the Hochelaga Archipelago.After the Island of Montreal, the √éle Jesus, the √éle Perrot and the √éle Bizard.  Geography  Example of banks on the island eaten away by erosion caused by the wake. The Durocher house is threatened by this erosion. √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se is long and wide.. Its subsoil (limestone in the western part, shale clay in the eastern part) is covered with a layer of clay sand suitable for agriculture. The banks of the island are composed of clay and sand and are sensitive to erosion. The 11 km perimeter area is almost uninhabited and accessible only by boat. The island is made up of agricultural land, marshes and forest. A farmer grows soybeans there. The island is surrounded by several chalets, for the most part without occupancy rights, on land belonging to the Government of Quebec.. Some private properties are present such as the Durocher house which is one of the last buildings testifying to the agricultural occupation of the island.  History  The first occupants of Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island were the Amerindians occupying the Saint-Laurent valley. The oldest archaeological remains found on the island date back to about . The sites excavated in the 1980s demonstrate frequent occupation by Amerindians but probably associated with short stays or halts since no trace of intensive occupation has been identified.. The writings of the early days of the French colony testify that the site is used by the Iroquois since in 1665 Charles Le Moyne d'Iberville went there to hunt and was surrounded and captured there. = Under the French regime = In 1662, the island was conceded in noble fief to Ignace Boucher, son of Pierre Boucher. The origin of the name Sainte-Th√©r√®se is unknown but it is mentioned for the first time at this time and probably refers to the new queen Marie- Th√©r√®se. Pierre Boucher mentions this island in his pamphlet of 1664. The island probably remains uninhabited by French settlers until 1667. Michel- Sidrac Du Gu√© de Boisbriand, obtained in 1667 permission to settle on the island and therefore became its first historic occupant. Du Gu√© de Boisbriand is captain of a fireboat in the Carignan Regiment and arrived in America with the expedition Carignan-Salli√®re. In 1667 with the help of Jean Hayet dit Malo, Captain Du Gu√© cleared the island and several oak logs were shipped to the Quebec shipyard. One of the boats built with island wood will be called the Griffon. In 1672, the Intendant Talon conceded to Du Gu√© de Boisbriand what became the seigneury of √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se and which included √éle Sainte- Th√©r√®se and the neighboring islands. Du Gu√© de Boisbriand also has a stronghold on the western tip of the island of Montreal which will bear the name Boisbriand. Du Gu√© de Boisbriand was mainly occupied by his military career (he was part of several of Frontenac's expeditions) and trade (notably the trade in brandy among the Amerindians). He will reside alternately in Boisbriand and on Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island. In 1674, he conceded 2 lots on the west side of the island, one to Mathurin Gauthier dit Landeville and the other to Antoine Hoquet dit le Picard. In 1675, a notarial deed tells us that he rents his farm on the island to Nicolas Ragueneau and Louis Truchon dit L√©veill√© for a period of 5 years. Around 1679 Du Gu√© de Boisbriand moved to Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island with his wife Marie Moyen. It seems that he had a preference for the island and its landscapes and perhaps that is why he will call his first daughter Marie-Th√©r√®se. The census of 1681 mentions that 7 children, 2 servants and a servant reside in the manor of the lord. He has 40 arpents in value, 16 head of cattle and a flour mill. The 1681 census counted 53 residents on the island divided into 14 dwellings. The residences surround the island and are located less than 40 meters from the shore.. Among these islanders is Louis Brien dit Desrochers ancestor of the Brien, Desrochers and Durocher families of America. From Ploermel in Brittany, Louis arrived in Canada a few years earlier. He was first tailor of clothing in Trois-Rivi√®res then in Montreal where he married Suzanne Bouvier in 1681. The same year he settled on Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island where he will have a large descendants of which several representatives will live in the island until 1952. Also among the islanders is Jean Bousquet, who came from Tonin in Guyenne, a master gunsmith who worked at the forges of Saint-Maurice. He married Catherine Fourrier in 1672 and they settled on the island in 1680. There is also Jean Voyne (Venne) who came to the island in 1675 and who married Catherine Bousquet (daughter of Jean Bousquet). They had numerous descendants who bore the name of Venne and several of whom settled in Pointe-aux-Trembles. The name of Nicholas Choquet is also among the first islanders, this soldier from the Carignan-Salli√®re regiment (1665) cultivated on the island in 1667. In 1681 he owned two acres in Varennes and he settled there and left a large number descendants bearing the names of Choquet or Choquette. Charles Desmares is also one of them, this shoemaker from Normandy owns a farm on the island in 1681. By his son Basil, he is the ancestor of the Desmarrais of Varennes and Boucherville.. Du Gu√© de Boisbriand died in 1689 after a full military career, but it seems that he had financial difficulties since the inventory of his property on Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island drawn up in 1688 suggests a neglected domain. The Captain had left his family and his lordship of √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se in the care of his friend Charles-Gaspard Piot de Langloiserie, a French gentleman who arrived in New France in 1691 and who in the same year married the eldest daughter of Du Gu√©, Marie-Th√©r√®se. In 1695, the population of the island increased by 60% compared to the census of 1681, which testifies to the richness of the site. Gideon de Gascogne (Catalonia?) During his visit at the beginning of the 18th century mentions that \\"the land is good for the government to produce all kinds of grains and vegetables, aussy all the inhabitants are very comfortable there\\". Jean-Sidrac Du Gu√© de Boisbriand, eldest son of the first lord of the island, to whom the seigniorial title belonged, sold his title to his brother-in-law, the knight Piot de Langloiserie in 1706. The latter died in 1715, leaving the lordship to the care of his wife Marie-Th√©r√®se Piot (n√©e Du Gu√©) for about a quarter of a century. The lord watched over the grain since in 1740 she obtained from the intendant Hocquart an order prohibiting free grazing on the islands around Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island, a practice then widespread. A land register of the island, made in 1723, has 23 locations on which stand 19 houses. In 1742, Louis-Hector Piot de Langloiserie, eldest son of Hector and Marie-Th√©r√®se became the new lord of the island a year before the death of his mother. From him, we know that there were discussions of marriage between him and Marguerite Du Frost de la Jammerai (who will later be known as M√®re d'Youville) but that he later married Esther Bridge and lived for a time in the English colonies. In 1726 he had obtained from New York legislation the privilege of porpoise fishing and he would have resided in this state for several years before returning to Quebec. When he became lord of the island in 1742, he was an interpreter and worked with the governor in Quebec. During the English conquest, √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se was occupied by General Murray in 1760 to camp his troops there before taking Montreal. Murray will draw a detailed map of the island and its surroundings. = Under the English regime = After the English conquest, Louis-Hector Piot de Langloiserie lost his fief since his heritage was seized in 1778 and was awarded to John Maxwell, an English speculator, who sold it the following year to Louis-Joseph Ainsse (or Hainse) who was resident of Varennes.. Louis-Joseph Ainse had illustrated himself in the trade in Michilimakinac by allying himself by marriage to the Dakota and then as interpreter with the military. According to some the name Ainse comes from the German Heinz. Ainse, a successful trader, officially became lord of √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se in 1781. The same year, he gave a contract to build a first windmill on the island. He died in 1802 and succeeded him as lord of the island his son Joseph Ainse who had married in 1817 Charlotte Vigneau. It is uncertain whether the two Ainse lords have resided on the island permanently or temporarily but their homes are known to them in Varennes. According to local history, an imposing stately-style residence was located at a place called \\"du cass\\" (helmet), located on the south-western tip of the island.. Children of Joseph Ainse and Charlotte Vigneau, two of his daughters will have a role in the uprising of the Patriots of 1837-38. Fran√ßoise Ainse as wife of Doctor Eug√®ne-Napol√©on Duchesnois and Zo√© Ainse as wife of Amury Girod. This agronomist of Swiss origin who published several writings in the form of articles or treatises including in 1834 \\"Conversations on agriculture, by a inhabitants of Varennes\\" and in 1835 a small book called \\"Notes divers sur le Canada\\". We know that he and his wife resided on the island following Local history dictates that the Ainse manor house on Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island housed a printing press which was used to print \\"La Minerve\\", the Patriots' journal.Memory by Jacques Durocher, son of Raoul Durocher. With his brother- in-law Doctor Duchesnois, Girod becomes a member of the Sons of Liberty and keeps a diary in German and Italian which describes in detail the events of 1837. We know in particular that in November 1837 Papineau and Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan canoe from Pointe-Aux-Trembles to √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se to look for Girod, but it is in Varennes the next day that they will find him and it is there that one of the decisive meetings that will have led to the armed insurrection. Girod writes in his journal: \\"I don't remember which one of us is, but it seems to me that it was Boucher [-Belleville] who proposed that a convention be convened and that a provisional government be established. We We acquiesced in his proposal, but added that this first measure amounted to an act of open rebellion and that it would be good to seek means of organizing the people and of obtaining arms and ammunition. We all agreed on this proposal and we started talking about our departure. \\"It is decided that Papineau and the others will go to fight at Saint-Charles and that Girod will go to Saint-Eustache. During the battle of Saint-Eustache he fled and he was subsequently denounced and hunted down and he committed suicide at Pointe-aux- Trembles in December 1837. Maison Durocher, built around 1913. Farm house testifying to the agricultural occupation of Sainte-Th√©r√®se Island. During this first half of the 19th century there was little information on the inhabitants of the island but we know that the population on the island remains stable since between the censuses of 1723 and 1859, the number of locations and houses remains similar on the island ie 19. In 1841 a first school teacher was active on the island. Despite its agricultural wealth, the island having no hamlet or church, the inhabitants are dependent on the cities of Varennes and Pointe-Aux-Trembles for trade and religious and administrative affairs. The population of the island tends to decrease in the second half of the XIXth century. In 1897 there were only 12 locations left on the island, 7 in 1942 and 5 in 1944. In the early 1950s, following the opening of the seaway and the passage of icebreakers which had the effect of isolating the island from the south shore in winter, the last inhabitants of the island packed up. Among them is Raoul Durocher, descendant of Louis Brien dit Desrochers and his wife Marie-Anna Provost. In the 1950s, the island was known for its beaches on its southeast facade, notably the Choquette and Bissonnette beaches, which are served by a ferryman from Varennes and Montreal. The Beaudoin family from Pointe-Aux-Trembles operated some of these ferrymen. In the early 1980s, a park was set up on √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se and a ferryman brought visitors to Varennes and Pointe-Aux-Trembles. A cycle path is provided as well as rest and picnic facilities. This park will stop its activities at the end of the 1980s. During the 2010s, a new park project was developed by the mayors of the cities of Varennes and Pointe-aux-Trembles. In 2015-2016, the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources expelled several vacationers without the right to occupy.  Ecology  √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se, which includes a wide variety of natural environments (woodlands around the perimeter, central meadows and swamps), is considered a site of wildlife interest.Revised development plan for the Lajemmerais RCM, September 28, 2005 In particular, there are fish such as muskellunge, birds such as heron, butor, tern and gulls, and mammals such as field vole, raccoon, red fox, long-tailed weasel and the muskrat. The swallow of shore or sand swallow is also very present on the banks of the island. Waterfowl are also plentiful on the island and Duck Unlimited built a marsh there in the 1980s. √éle Sainte-Th√©r√®se has been the subject of several park projects since the 1970s, but it faces many ecological challenges. Since the opening of the seaway in the 1950s, the south-eastern shores of the island have been affected by erosion caused by the mooring. In certain sectors located a few hundred meters from the seaway, it is between 1 and 2 meters from the shores that erode annually. In the 1980s, the construction of the Rivi√®re-des-Prairies sewage treatment plant and its emissary from √éle aux Vaches, which dumps Montreal's wastewater on the southeast flank of the island, contributed to the deterioration of water quality to the point where swimming, once famous on the island, is now impossible.  Heritage  The island harbors Amerindian and European archaeological sites dating from the beginning of colonization.Montreal Regional Council for the Environment Several of the houses and buildings testifying to the occupation of the island are in ruins. A house built around 1913 by No√´l Alias Durocher is still present and maintained by members of the Durocher family. Several lighthouses of different sizes are located around the island.

It serves as a sequel to his 1932 novel Safe Custody. The book was published in the US under the title The Laughing Bacchante.  Plot  With Austria threatened by the Anschluss, John and Olivia Ferrers ask Richard Chandos and Jonathan Mansel to help them recover the priceless carved jewels collection of the Borgia Pope Alexander VI, that, at the end of Safe Custody, had been left in a walled-up chamber of Hohenems Castle in Carinthia. Punter, a minor villain who had been part of a previous attempt to steal them, tells the educated crook Friar the story of that venture and Friar, along with his associates Sloper, Orris and Goat, decides to make a further attempt. After Mansel foils them, Friar deliberately attracts the attention of a German, Boler, to try and make Mansel's task more problematic. Diana Revoke, apparently an upper-class Englishwoman, appears on the scene and adds to the heroes' difficulties. Having extracted the gems, and briefly taken refuge in Wagensburg Castle (the scene of the action in Blind Corner), Chandos joins a group of strolling players led by Jasper and Colette, to help smuggle them over the border into Italy and eventually to England where a museum awaits them. Other characters from previous novels include the manservants Bell and Carson, Andrew Palin, and Jenny Chandos.  Background  The book was published soon after Mercer had completed the building of a new house in Southern Rhodesia to which he and his wife had retired. This was his replacement for \\"Cockade\\" in Southern France (described in The House That Berry Built) which was empty and still a worry to him.  Critical reception  US edition Mercer's biographer AJ Smithers, writing in 1982, expressed admiration for the way in which Mercer marshalled his characters. By continually bringing back old friends who give the impression of being one big family, his readers feel almost honorary family members themselves.

History  The idea was introduced thirty years ago as the nonlinear approach to the concept of transmission of zeros. The original purpose of introducing the concept was to develop an asymptotic stabilization with a set of guaranteed regions of attraction (semi-global stabilizability), to make the overall system stable.  Initial working  Given the internal dynamics of any system, zero dynamics refers to the control action chosen in which the output variables of the system are kept identically zero. While, various systems have an equally distinctive set of zeros, such as decoupling zeros, invariant zeros, and transmission zeros. Thus, the reason for developing this concept was to control the non-minimum phase and nonlinear systems effectively.  Applications  The concept is widely utilized in SISO mechanical systems, whereby applying a few heuristic approaches, zeros can be identified for various linear systems. Zero dynamics adds an essential feature to the overall system‚Äôs analysis and the design of the controllers. Mainly its behavior plays a significant role in measuring the performance limitations of specific feedback systems. In a Single Input Single Output system, the zero dynamics can be identified by using junction structure patterns. In other words, using concepts like bond graph models can help to point out the potential direction of the SISO systems. Apart from its application in nonlinear standardized systems, similar controlled results can be obtained by using zero dynamics on nonlinear discrete-time systems. In this scenario, the application of zero dynamics can be an interesting tool to measure the performance of nonlinear digital design systems (nonlinear discrete-time systems). Before the advent of zero dynamics, the problem of acquiring non- interacting control systems by using internal stability was not specifically discussed. However, with the asymptotic stability present within the zero dynamics of a system, static feedback can be ensured. Such results make zero dynamics an interesting tool to guarantee the internal stability of non- interacting control systems.

Trees and forests play multiple roles in J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy world of Middle-earth, some such as Old Man Willow indeed serving as characters in the plot. Both for Tolkien personally, and in his Middle-earth writings, caring about trees really mattered. Indeed, the Tolkien scholar Matthew Dickerson wrote \\"It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of trees in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien.\\" Tolkien stated that primeval human understanding was communion with other living things; critics note that Middle-earth was set in the distant past, when primeval forests still existed. Forests play varying roles in his books. In The Hobbit, Mirkwood is the dark forbidding forest of fairy tale. In The Lord of the Rings, forests are more complex; some trees are woken up by the Elves, while others are going bad. Fangorn forest is the realm of Treebeard, a tree-giant or Ent, who herds trees including the Huorns which are halfway between Ents and trees, either becoming animated or reverting to becoming treelike. Some specific kinds of tree are important in Tolkien's stories, such as the tall Mallorn trees at the heart of Lothl√≥rien. In Tom Bombadil's Old Forest, Old Man Willow is a malign and fallen tree-spirit of great age, controlling much of the forest. Early in the creation, the Two Trees of Valinor, one silver, one gold, gave light to the paradisiacal realm of Valinor. Commentators have written that trees gave Tolkien a way of expressing his eco-criticism, opposed to damaging industrialisation. Forests in Middle-earth Tolkien makes use of forests across Middle-earth, from the Trollshaws and Mirkwood in The Hobbit, reappearing in The Lord of the Rings, to the Old Forest, Lothl√≥rien, and Fangorn which feature in chapters of The Lord of the Rings, and the great forests of Beleriand and Valinor mentioned in The Silmarillion. Indeed, while Middle-earth was still \\"in a twilight under the stars\\", the \\"oldest living things had arisen: ... on earth, the shadows of great trees\\".The Silmarillion, \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" For Tolkien critic Tom Shippey, the mention of Mirkwood is an echo of the Norse mythology of the Elder Edda, with the pathless forests of the North over the Misty Mountains mentioned in one of the poems in the Edda, the Skirnismal. The Tolkien scholars Shelley Saguaro and Deborah Cogan Thacker write that while it might seem that Tolkien is using trees and forests mainly to represent the natural world, as against the industrial modern world, they are rather \\"a multi-layered portrayal, with subtle links to fairy tale and folklore, and complex psychological symbolism.\\" They note that forests recur in fairy stories, as places where the protagonist becomes lost, where witches and woodcutters and wolves live. They recall that in Tree and Leaf, Tolkien's account of fairy tales, such stories are in his words \\"unanalysable .. outside Time itself maybe\\". They mention the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim's interpretation, that going into the forest \\"signifies a psychoanalytic space ‚Äì a place separated from everyday experience in which to be lost is to be found\\", and Jack Zipes's alternative view, based on his analysis of the Brothers Grimm, that the forest makes enchantment possible, because the conventions of society do not apply there. They note, too, Tolkien's own position, which is that the primeval human understanding was, as he wrote in Tree and Leaf, \\"communion with other living things\\", now lost. They cite Tolkien critic Paul Kocher as stating that Middle-earth is meant to be the Earth itself in the distant past, when the primeval forests still existed, and with them, a wholeness that is also now lost. As for Mirkwood, they write, its role in The Hobbit is both to be the dark forbidding forest of fairy tale as Bilbo pursues his quest as in \\"a classical quest narrative\\", and to have the familiar qualities of a real wood. The forests and trees of The Lord of the Rings are, however, \\"much more complex\\": trees may change, whether by being \\"woken up by Elves\\" as were the Ents, or \\"going bad\\" like some of the trees in the Old Forest. Saguaro and Thacker comment that Tolkien clearly loved trees; he was often photographed with them, such as with the large black pine in the Oxford Botanic Garden. The \\"mythical mallorn\\" tree may be magical: but for Tolkien, all trees were, they write, in some sense \\"magical\\". Dickerson adds that Tolkien used a tree as a picture of his own subcreation in Leaf by Niggle; and when his friend C. S. Lewis died, he applied the picture to himself, writing that he felt \\"like an old tree that is losing all its leaves one by one: this feels like an axe-blow near the roots\\".Letters, #251 to Priscilla Tolkien, 26 November 1963 Ents Tolkien was inspired by trees and forests in England. An old oak in Savernake Forest Fangorn forest is the realm of Treebeard (also called Fangorn), a tree-giant or Ent (from the Old English for \\"giant\\"), one of the oldest living things, or actually the oldest living thing, in Middle-earth. The Ents are tree-herds; they look much like trees, though they have branch-like arms, root-like legs, faces, and the ability to move and speak. Among their charges are the Huorns, which are either trees in the process of becoming animated, or Ents that are reverting to becoming treelike.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 4 \\"Treebeard\\"The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 9 \\"Flotsam and Jetsam\\" Tree species in Middle-earth Specific kinds of tree also play a role, such as the tall Mallorn trees of Lothl√≥rien; Galadriel gives Sam Gamgee a seed of the more or less magical Mallorn, and he plants it in the party field, near the centre of the Shire, to replace the much-loved tree there cut down by Sharkey's men.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 8 \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\"The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 9 \\"The Grey Havens\\" Tolkien's poem \\"Sing all ye joyful!\\" at the end of The Hobbit has in its last verse a mention of six kinds of tree:The Hobbit, ch. 19 \\"The Last Stage\\" The last phrase naming three English trees echoes Rudyard Kipling's \\"A Tree Song\\", with its refrain \\"Of all the trees that grow so fair, Old England to adorn, Greater are none beneath the Sun, Than Oak, and Ash, and Thorn.\\" The Tolkien critic Tom Shippey writes that while Tolkien does not mention Kipling, he shares the \\"theme of unchanging Englishness\\" seen in Kipling's writing. Tolkien names the same three trees in Tree and Leaf: \\"Each leaf, of oak and ash and thorn, is a unique embodiment of the pattern...\\"; Saguaro and Thacker write that this is \\"a plea for the 'recovery fairy stories help us to make'\\". Dale Nelson in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia writes that the affinity of Kipling's Puck for these three trees \\"make him kin to Bombadil and Treebeard\\". Individual trees =Mythic symbols= The White Tree was the symbol of the Kings of Gondor. The Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion and Laurelin, one silver, one gold, gave light to the paradisiacal realm of Valinor,The Silmarillion, \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", ch. 1 \\"Of the Beginning of Days\\" where \\"Through long ages the Valar dwelt in bliss in the light of the Trees beyond the Mountains of Aman\\". This continued until they were destroyed by the evil giant spider Ungoliant and the first Dark Lord, Melkor, leaving only a flower and a fruit which became the Moon and the Sun for Middle-earth.The Silmarillion, \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", ch. 8 \\"Of the Darkening of Valinor\\" The Tolkien scholar Matthew Dickerson writes that the Two Trees are \\"the most important mythic symbols in all of the legendarium\\". The White Tree in the court at the top of Minas Tirith was the symbol of the Kings of Gondor. During the many years when that land was ruled by Stewards in the absence of a King, the White Tree was dead and leafless but still honoured. On Aragorn's return to the city, as described in The Return of the King, he climbs Mount Mindolluin behind the citadel, and finds a seedling of the same tree that had somehow germinated there in the snow. He returns with it to the citadel and plants it in the court, where it quickly comes to flower.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 5 \\"The Steward and the King\\" Saguaro and Thacker call this \\"deliberately religious language and imagery\\". Dickerson writes that it is the symbol of Aragorn's kingship, being descended from Nimloth, the White Tree of Numenor, itself descended from Telperion. =Fallen nature= Old Man Willow is a malign tree-spirit of great age in Tom Bombadil's Old Forest, appearing physically as a large willow tree beside the River Withywindle, but spreading his influence throughout the forest, who as Tolkien explainsThe Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 6 \\"The Old Forest\\" Tolkien, a Roman Catholic, believed that living things such as trees had been affected by the Fall of Man. Medieval statuary of the Fall at Notre Dame de Paris Saguaro and Thacker comment that critics have puzzled over this depiction, as it does not fit with Tolkien's image as an environmentalist \\"tree-hugger\\". They write that trees (like other creatures) are in Tolkien's world subject to the corruption of the Fall of Man, mentioning Tolkien's Catholicism. They state that while Tolkien's writings on the meaning of trees verges on the pagan, both the Old and the New Testament use trees as symbols, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in Genesis, the Cross, the tree of death in the Gospels, and the Tree of Life in Revelation (22:2); and that Tolkien succeeds in \\"bring[ing] all these elements together\\" in The Lord of the Rings: death, creation, sub-creation, re-creation. Dickerson writes that Old Man Willow indicates both that nature, like Man, is fallen, and that it is actively hostile to Man. The Tolkien critic Jared Lobdell compares the \\"treachery of natural things in an animate world\\" seen in the character of Old Man Willow to Algernon Blackwood's story \\"The Willows\\". Eco-criticism in Tolkien's writings Dickerson comments that trees provide \\"a potent vehicle for [Tolkien's] eco-criticism.\\" The party tree in Hobbiton near the centre of the Shire appears at the beginning and the end of The Lord of the Rings: at the start, as the tree that just happens to be in the party field, a happy place; at the end, cut down by Saruman's ruffians to no useful purpose.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 1 \\"A Long-Expected Party\\" Dickerson writes that Saruman's \\"evil ways\\" are revealed exactly by his \\"wanton destruction\\" of Fangorn's trees, and notes that Treebeard calls Saruman an \\"accursed tree- slayer\\".The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 6 \\"Many Partings\\" The Tolkien critic Paul Kocher notes that Treebeard says that ents have a far closer sympathy for trees than shepherds do for their sheep, because \\"ents are 'good at getting inside other things'\\". He also cites Treebeard's statement that he is \\"not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether on my side ... nobody cares for the woods as I care for them\\", but notes that all the same, he is driven by the knowledge that Saruman has taken sides in the War of the Ring to take action against him. He destroys Saruman's industrial Isengard, whose factories Saruman was fuelling by cutting down Treebeard's trees. After the destruction of the One Ring, Aragorn gives wide lands for new forest; but, Kocher writes, Tolkien gives \\"ominous hints that the wild wood will not prosper in the expanding Age of Man\\" that will follow.

They are best known for their television segments called BodyBreak, which have been in intermittent production since 1988. The program is considered a cult classic among Canadian pop culture. Johnson and McLeod were both international-level athletes, Johnson with baseball and McLeod with the track and field discipline of hurdles. The duo self-financed the pilot for BodyBreak in 1988. Rejected by over 40 companies, they received funding from ParticipACTION for 65 episodes. Over 300 short episodes have been produced, as well as a single-season television series. They have expanded the program into speaking engagements, exercise equipment, and other projects. As a result of racism that Johnson and his parents experienced, their programs and products have intentionally sought to feature an inclusive cast.  Biography  = Hal Johnson = Johnson was born in the United States, and grew up in North York, the child of Black and Irish parents. (Johnson has spoken on the racism they faced for their mixed marriage.) Johnson was diagnosed with dyslexia as a child; he would later memorize all the lines for BodyBreak. The captain of his high school's hockey, baseball, basketball and football teams, Johnson attended the University of Colorado on a baseball scholarship, earning a business degree. An all-star first baseman, he represented Canada at the World Baseball Championship. Over 10 years, Johnson lived in the United States, attending the University of Colorado, and living in Washington, D.C., Long Beach, San Francisco, Denver, and Boulder. After his athletic career, Johnson was hired at TSN as a sports reporter. Network executives rescinded that offer the same day it was made, stating that they didn't want a second Black reporter. As an extra in an advertisement for Woodbine Racetrack, during the 1980s, Johnson was moved so that he wouldn't be sitting next to a white woman. These experiences of racism, as well as the experiences of his parents, helped push Johnson to create BodyBreak as a countermeasure. The show deliberately sought inclusive casting. Johnson has commented that \\"the media has not only a tremendous responsibility, but a tremendous power\\" to influence public perception and acceptance. In 2020, the topic of racism became central, following the protests initiated by the killing of George Floyd. Johnson recorded an unscripted video titled \\"How We Battled Racism\\". The video received wide attention in Canada, and led to Johnson speaking on the subject on many media outlets. TSN issued an apology. Johnson appeared on Off the Record with Michael Landsberg over 100 times. He acted in various television series between 1988 and 1990, including day player roles in T. and T., Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and E.N.G. Johnson's former mustache is well-known. = Joanne McLeod = McLeod is of German and Italian heritage, and grew up in Scarborough with her adoptive family. McLeod's physical education teacher in high school had competed at the 1968 Olympic Games. The teacher encouraged McLeod to join a track club. She became a 4-time national and 7-time provincial hurdle champion. She represented Canada at events including the Pacific Conference Games, World Cup, Tri-Meet-Canada/PolandEngland, and the 1978 Commonwealth Games. As of 2013, McLeod was reported to be still running marathons. = As a couple = Hal and Joanne met in a gym, and started to date. Hal and Joanne married in 1999. They tour the country doing speaking engagements on the topics of health and teamwork. After living in Mississauga, the couple has lived in Oakville, Ontario since 2000.  BodyBreak  = Segments = Over 300 90-second episodes of BodyBreak have been produced, with the first 128 segments created between 1988 and 1994. The show focuses on how exercise can be incorporated into daily life. The program was conceived by McLeod and Johnson after meeting in a gym. Looking to produce a fitness show that was different than the other programs of the era, they looked to create something friendly, representing genders equally, and showing racial and physical diversity, a result of Johnson's experiences. They financed the show's pilot with their last $2000, collectively. Johnson worked on the series, while McLeod worked at Canada Life insurance to pay their bills. Three two-minute segments were filmed in July 1988, in Toronto's Sherwood Park, as a pilot. More than 40 TV stations, ad agencies, and other corporations turned the pitch down. More than one was concerned with the image of people of different ethnic backgrounds interacting as equals. One was open to airing the program, but only if Joanne McLeod was joined by a white man; at least one report lists that broadcaster as TSN. Johnson decided to seek funding for the project from ParticipACTION, a federal government program. The organization commissioned five segments, with an additional order placed in January 1989, before the first airing. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was the first network to air the spots. ParticipACTION dropped the hosts in 1991, after they had completed 65 segments, despite being the agency's most popular spots. They found different funding, and were able to continue production in 1992. They produced segments with Canada's Vitality project from 1993 to 1995. The segments were broadcast during commercial breaks as public service announcements on many Canadian television channels, but the most frequent broadcaster of the program was TSN. = Television series = In 1995, Life Network commissioned a 13 half-hour episode series based on the popular segments, which it aired in primetime. Most of the episodes included people with disabilities. = Business = Johnson has stated that the duo has \\"no business plan,\\" so that they don't close themselves off from unexpected opportunities. In 2020, Johnson commented that \\"as many successes that we've had, we've had a hundred failures. I expect that. I expect to fail... I'll find another way around it.\\" The BodyBreak brand has been used on a treadmill, Ab Master Workout, Step Workout, and other products. Hal and Joanne have also endorsed products without the trademark, including BackJoy. = Appearances = The couple competed in season 1 of The Amazing Race Canada. The possibility of being eliminated early in the season meant that their participation was considered risky. As such, the duo's months-long preparation included driving stick shift cars at the show's sponsor. They finished in sixth place. They feel they were portrayed in the series of \\"very vanilla,\\" until the final episode, in which McLeod accidentally swore. In the months following The Amazing Race, they were the grand marshals of the 2013 Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest Parade, and guest \\"anchors\\" on news comedy program This Hour Has 22 Minutes. Johnson and McLeod appeared in the music video for Sam Weber's \\"Anybodys'\\", chasing an anthropomorphized version of Johnson's mustache. They self-parodied in a promotion for Netflix zombie series Santa Clarita Diet; BuzzFeed deemed them \\"the cutest cannibals.\\" They created a COVID-19 physical distancing segment for Vancouver International Airport.

She transported Jews out of Germany in the early years of the Nazi regime and later emigrated from Nazi Germany to Japan, where she lived for several years before settling in the United States. Life in Germany Hammerstein was born in 1909 in Magdeburg, one of seven children born to Maria von L√ºttwitz (daughter of Walther von L√ºttwitz) and Kurt von Hammerstein- Equord, a general who would later serve as commander-in-chief of the Reichswehr in the 1930s. She and her siblings were encouraged to explore intellectual and political ideas; she had many Jewish friends and planned to move to Palestine with some of them. She enrolled at a public school where she could study agriculture, and went on to attend the University of Berlin. Following Adolf Hitler's ascension to power in 1933, she helped Jews and intellectuals escape Germany by taking them to Prague on her motorcycle. She also provided the Jewish and anti-Nazi community in Prague with newspapers and warned them about Nazi plans that she learned from her father. In 1935, she married John H. Paasche, a man of Jewish ancestry whose father, Hans Paasche, was a known pacifist. Maria and John briefly moved to Palestine before returning to Germany due to a typhoid outbreak. They emigrated to Japan after several interrogations by the Gestapo. Maria's father plotted unsuccessfully to kill Hitler in 1939, and two of her brothers took part in another conspiracy to kill Hitler in 1944; her mother and two siblings were imprisoned in concentration camps until the end of World War II. Life in the United States Maria and John Paasche lived for several years in Japan, where all four of their children were born, but migrated to San Francisco in 1948 due to fears of the German exile community and being monitored by the Japanese police. In San Francisco, Maria initially cleaned houses while John worked in a tomato canning factory. She went on to become a literary researcher, and was fluent in German, French, Russian and English. In later life, she lived in San Francisco's Jewish Home for the Aged; she was the facility's second-ever non- Jewish resident. She died in San Francisco on 21 January 2000 from heart failure.

Sixty years after her death, she remains one of the better remembered representatives of the Worpswede Artists' Colony.Christine Krause: Die Bilderwelt der Malerin Lisel Oppel. page 301: \\"Tod in der Bremer Nervenklinik, dem heutigen Klinikum Bremen-Ost\\"  Biography  = Provenance and early years = Anna Amalie Elisabeth \\"Lisel\\" Oppel was born at Bremen, the youngest of her parents' seven, or more children. Alwin Oppel (1849 - 1929), her father, was a secondary school teacher and a distinguished economist. Her mother, Amalie Oppel, born Amalie Baumann, was her father's second wife and came originally from Herisau (Appenzell) in the traditionally conservative north-east of Switzerland. While Lisel was growing up the family lived at L√ºbecker Stra√üe 31, a town house in the heart of Bremen. During 1914/15 Oppel studied for three terms at the \\"Kunst-gewerbeschule\\" (as the Bremen applied arts academy was then known). Here her teachers included Ernst M√ºller-Scheessel with whom she studied landscape painting. Following the outbreak of war at the end of July 1914 she broke off her studies, concentrating on looking after her parents over the next couple of years. She resumed her studied during 1917/18, spending three terms, this time, at the (subsequently renamed and then merged) \\"K√∂nigliche Kunstgewerbeschule\\" (loosely, \\"Royal Academy of Applied Art\\") in Munich. The academy director, Richard Riemerschmid, was among her teachers. She was also taught by Hermann Groeber: he was particularly encouraging and influential in respect of her subsequent career development. Two of Lisa Oppel's maternal-side aunts in Switzerland were acknowledged painters. Her own wish to train as an artist had triggered no significant parental opposition. She nevertheless rejected suggestions that she should become an art teacher, thereby ruling out the chance to embark on what was seen as a relatively secure career with a regular income. Instead her ambition, according to surviving academy records, was to become a \\"freelance artist\\". = Worpswede = From 1919 she was based in the village of Worpswede which since 1889 had been designated, by a number of influential artists of the period, as an Artists' Colony. Between 1919 and 1929, albeit with several major breaks, she lodged at a succession of farm cottages and other dwellings in and around the village in order to pursue her career as an artist. Art was not always sufficiently lucrative to pay the rent, and she frequently supplemented her income with farm work, especially during the crisis years immediately following the war. Worpswede remained her home base till 1960, the year of her death, although there were a number of extended trips abroad through those years. In 1920 she moved in to live for a couple of years with Martha Vogeler, then newly divorced, at her little museum complex (\\"Haus am Schluh\\"). After a succession of further moves Oppel installed herself in her final Worpswede home, the so-called \\"Weyerberg Hut\\" (\\"Weyerbergh√ºtte\\") in 1954.Christine Krause: Die Malerin Lisel Oppel 1897‚àí1960. Ein faszinierendes Leben in Worpswede und am Mittelmeer, Bremen 2010, pp. 48‚àí54 = Campania = Between 1927 and 1937 Oppel took several trips to Italy, sometimes apparently on a whim, and including at least one visit lasting several years. In Italy she produced watercolors and oil paintings. She also undertook work for ceramics businesses locally. The longest of her Italian trips took her to the Bay of Naples and lasted five years, between 1930 and 1935. Sources conflict over the time line of her five years stay, but according to at least one version she lived initially, following her arrival, in Vietri. Then, in 1932/33, she moved to Positano, also living at one stage on the Island of Ischia. According to at least one source it was between 1930 and 1932 that she worked as a ceramics artist at the \\"Industria Ceramica Salernitades\\" (I.C.S.) ceramics and pottery factory in Vietri. The factory had been set up a few years earlier by an expatriate businessman from Hamburg called Max Melamerson. During the years directly preceding the Second World War it provided employment to a succession of footloose painters from northern Germany. Oppel was also by now receiving - and continued to receive throughout her life - a small monthly payment from an unidentified source in Bremen which she herself identifies in her papers simply as her \\"v√§terliche Rente\\" (\\"paternal pension\\"). Little that is identifyable as Oppel's work survives from her work with the ceramicists, and indeed most of her surviving output comes from work that she produced after 1945. Two large vases with scenic motifs and one image of a kneeling madonna with child, all of them featuring Oppel's painting from the 1930s, have been located in a private collection on Ischia, however. = Claudio = The Bay of Naples and the Amalfi Coastal strip beyond it, along the road towards Salerno, attracted many German intellectuals during the 1920s and 1930s. A network of expatriate artists grew up. Among those in the circle to which Lisel Oppel adhered were Kurt Craemer and his friend Karli Sohn-Rethel who shared a house in Positano till 1938. Others were Irene Kowaliska Armin Wegner. Lissel Oppel's son, Claudio, was born on Ischia during the summer of 1932. As far as is known, she brought the boy up without support from his father, on whose identity sources are conspicuously silent. Claudio would grow up to become a secondary school teacher in Germany like his grandfather. = R√©gime change = When she returned to Worpswede in 1935 Germany's political context had changed violently. Two years earlier right-wing populists had interpreted the country's parliamentary deadlock as a political opportunity, successfully taking power in January 1933. The Hitler government had lost no time in transforming what had been seen as a robust democracy into a one-party dictatorship. The Artists' Colony had also been transformed. In order to pursue any sort of career as an artist it was now necessary to become a member of the government's National Chamber of Visual Artists. Many had already done just that. Lisel Oppel rejected that approach, however, which meant that from now on she was unable to obtain the tools of her craft except through \\"unofficial channels\\". Her rejection of Nazism while living in Nazi Germany displayed self-belief and courage, as she presumably knew, but there will have been many at that time who would have seen it as an unwise choice. Her immediate solution to the tide difficulties she faced was to return to Italy, arriving this time in Calabria, early in 1936. In Italy a post-democratic government was also making life harder for artists not instinctively drawn to support the increasingly bizarre and destructive whims of the leadership, and in 1937 Lisel Oppel again came back to Worpswede. Between 1937 she worked from home for a Bremen-based Stoneware producer. In September 1939 a repeat partition of Poland triggered another major war. Oppel was conscripted to work as a technical draftswoman for the vast AG Weser shipbuilding company, and forced to live in a rented room in Bremen. Claudio at this stage remained in Worpswede, where he continued to attend school and where arrangements were made for him to be looked after. Oppel's career as a conscripted technical draftswoman lasted barely a year. In 1940 she collected her son and together they made their way south again, this time heading for the Chiemsee, a reedy lake in the marshy land between Munich and Salzburg. the move appears to have been the result of a characteristically impulsive decision, although a desire to get the child away from the British bombing would have provided an obvious rationale for the it. Their destination was the so-called \\"Fraueninsel\\", an island in the lake on which she was able to work again as a ceramicist at the island's potters' studio. She was back in Catholic territory again, and her output included more than painted tiles: there were angel-candlesticks and madonnas, kneeling or sitting, cradling a little Baby Jesus in her arms. She lived with her son in a holiday chalet owned by a family who according to the boy's later recollections treated Claudio like one of their own children. For part of her nearly three-year stint in Upper Bavaria Oppel lived and worked at a pottery factory on the shores of another lake, at Die√üen am Ammersee. The nature of her contractual arrangements during this time is not known, but it is evident that at least some of the work she was producing - possibly all of it - was made on the basis that she was working for herself, presumably renting space and equipment from the pottery in question, since she regularly shipped tiles to her friend Martha Vogeler in Artists' Colony so that they might be sold there. Sometimes she even took a train north and handed them over in person. Alongside the commercial work necessary to feed herself and her son, Lissel Oppel never abandoned what she regarded as her real profession, as a \\"fine art\\" painter. = Fine art and war = Every one or two years between 1937 and 1942 Oppel exhibited paintings in Bremen, participating in each of five collective exhibitions organised by the GEDOK, the nationwide association of female artists and art promoters of which she had become a member soon after its creation in 1926. Neither her move to Bavaria nor - at least till after 1942 - the war appear to have inhibited this. She built her reputation with buyers and critics, through her characteristic landscapes depicting the Teufelsmoor (loosely, \\"Devil's bog\\"), the fenland surrounding Worpswede in the otherwise mostly unpeopled countryside north of Bremen. From her time living and working on the island on the Chiemsee there are paintings of boats and the Chiemgau landscape, along with portraits of the potter, his wife, and the family with which she and her son lived there. These paintings are still (2020) in private collections. Meanwhile, Claudio completed his middle school career. In 1943 his mother enrolled him at a boarding school at Krems (on the edge of Vienna). This turned out badly, however, so she removed him from that institution and sent him instead to a \\"Bremen\\" secondary school which had been evacuated to a site at Lofer, just outside Salzburg, where he remained a pupil all the way through till September 1945. With Claudio securely settled in the south Oppel returned to Worpswede where she lived out the rest of the war, supporting herself with work for a ceramics factory in Bremen. She now befriended a French prisoner of war: contacts of this nature were against the rules, and someone denounced her to the authorities. On 21 March 1945 she was sentenced to twelve months of forced labour. Initially she was placed in a prison in Weserm√ºnde (as Bremerhaven had been temporarily renamed in 1939), before being transferred to another prison in nearby Stade. A month later the region was captured by British forces, however, and Oppel was released on 21 April 1945. Twelve months of forced labour had turned out to be no more than one month in prison. = Postwar years = Directly after the war Oppel seriously contemplated relocating to France. Instead she continued to base herself at Worpswede, but continued to be as internationally footloose as ever. She spent several months in Switzerland and revisited Positano and Ischia. She also discovered Spain and Morocco, sending long enthusiastic letters from Marrakesh to a friend. Her penultimate foreign trip was to Egypt, from where she referenced the Nunc dimittis ominously in a letter: \\"Now I can depart in peace, since mine eyes have seen ...\\" By the time she got back to Worpswede she clearly knew she was unwell, but she nevertheless insisted on travelling to Seville to experience the Easter celebrations there, impressions of which she recorded in an interesting series of watercolors. By the time she got home this time her illness could no longer be ignored. She was admitted to the hospital known today as the \\"Klinikum Bremen-Ost\\" where spinal cancer was diagnosed. She died very soon after receiving the diagnosis.  Works  As regards her painting, and in terms at least of the sheer quantity of known output, by far Lisel Oppel's most productve decade was her last, the 1950s. The paintings take forward the expressive approach adumbrated by her early work from the 1920s, but also powerfully reflecting an enhanced emphasis on the stronger colours and light which she had discovered during her visits to Italy during the 1930s, and now reinvigorated by her various extended visits to other parts of the Mediterranean region after 1945. Most of her paintings, especially those produced close to her Worpswede home, were in oils. Themes include people and animals, village life showing both people at work and people celebrating, notably in the moorland basin of the River Hamme. A particular joy in her painting, was children, often at play, in the countryside, which picked up on themes that had also inspired an earlier generation of Worpswede painters. Her image of \\"Lantern Children\\", with a background clearly showing the Hamme flatlands, achieved particular commercial success during the 1950s: this was a subject of which she painted countless variations. The other recurring theme of her later work, during a decade when foreign leisure travel was unaffordable for most Germans, was \\"distant lands\\". She would return from her travels with stacks of water colours. She liked to paint fisherfolk and farmers in southern Italy. There were street scenes of Madrid and Seville, along with paintings of the harbour at Tangier and life among the bazaars in Marrakesh. Her 1954 solo exhibition \\"Bremen Artists on the road\\" at the Kunsthalle was a particular success with the public. Loppel's sheer productivity, especially during her final decade, enabled her to make a good living from her painting. Her pictures were accessible and reassuring in ways that suited the mood of the times. The life of a freelance artist which had eleuded her as a young women became a reality, andn she was no longer driven to offer her services to industrial pottery factories. After her death interest in her work declined, but her reputation has undergone something of a revival following an exhibition of her work presented at the \\"Queen Christina House\\" (\\"Christinenhaus\\") in Zeven to mark the centenary of her birth. Prices at auctions when one of her works has gone on sale have also risen significantly over the past couple of decades. In 2008 her son Claudio, by this point described in sources as a \\"retired teacher\\", gifted a number of her paintings and other elements from her inheritance to the \\"Worpswede Archive\\" in the Barkenhoff, a large reassigned farm house in the heart of the artists' town. That means that more of her work turns up in public displays. Most of her output remains in private collections, however.

It is a Grade II listed building. History In the mid-19th century the local vestry board met in a room on the south-west corner of the Church of St George in the East. Board members decided this arrangement was inadequate for their needs and that they would procure a purpose-built vestry hall for the Parish of St George: the site chosen was to the north-east of the church and already formed part of the church grounds. The vestry hall, the western section of the current complex, was designed by Andrew Wilson in the Classical style and was completed in 1860. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Cable Street; there was a porch with Doric order columns and pilasters and a triglyphed frieze projecting from the central section and a row of windows interspersed with Ionic order columns on the first floor. A cornice bearing the words \\"Erected AD 1860\\" was added at roof level. The principal room was the board room (subsequently termed the council chamber) located on the first floor at the front of the building. On 1 October 1888 the inquest into the death of Elizabeth Stride, the third victim of the Whitechapel murders, was held in the building.Jack the Ripper: The Complete Casebook p. 76 The building was extended eastwards by adding an extra three bays to the five bays that already existed in a similar style in 1899; it went on to become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney as \\"Stepney Town Hall\\" in 1900. The area in front of the town hall was the scene of the Battle of Cable Street on Sunday 4 October 1936 when a clash took place between the Metropolitan Police, sent to protect a march by members of the British Union of Fascists, led by Oswald Mosley, and various anti-fascist demonstrators. A mural, which was subsequently painted on the side of the building to depict these events, was restored in the early 21st century. The building ceased to function as the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Tower Hamlets was formed in 1965. It was subsequently became the home of various community organisations including St George's Boxing Club. After the building was converted for commercial use in the 1990s, a community centre, managed by Unite the Union, was established in the basement in 2013.

Early life Paddock taught music in Cape Town, South Africa, before moving to London to help establish a startup. Career Paddock founded GetSmarter in 2008 as a South African startup. From the outset, GetSmarter aimed to offer short online courses in partnership with major Universities. It began with two educational partnerships in South Africa, one with Stellenbosch University and the other with University of Cape Town (UCT). Robert's co-founder had designed a virtual campus prior to GetSmarter, which was used as the foundation for the online workshop component.

Political and intellectual positions  In the 1870s and 1880s, there were many debates in Japan over the form of government the country was to adopt after the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji restoration strongly influenced by his stays abroad. Azusa Ono took part in the discussions and published numerous articles offering a point of view close to the British model. This was put into action upon his return to Japan by the creating a group of young intellectuals named Ky≈çzon d≈çsh≈´.

It was co-developed by Nintendo EPD and indieszero, and published by Nintendo for Nintendo Switch. It was released on December 27, 2019 in Japan, and January 3, 2020 in Europe and Australia. Dr Kawashima's Brain Training for Nintendo Switch builds upon previous instalments by adding puzzles and mini-games to strengthen the players memory and concentration skills. The game contains previous puzzles in the series, all of which are taught by Dr Kawashima. Puzzles in the game takes advantage of some the Nintendo Switch's functionalities such as the gyroscope and IR sensors. Physical editions of the game include a stylus to aid its touchscreen puzzles as an alternative to using the fingers. Gameplay The player is presented with two modes: Quick Play and Daily Training. This game is played mostly in handheld mode with barely any usage of the TV mode. The Nintendo Switch console is mostly held vertically during play for easier drawing and tapping on the touchscreen. In total, the game contains 24 unique puzzles, all of which utilise the console's technology such as the IR sensor in the right Joy- Con, the Joy-Con shoulder buttons and the touchscreen. In Quick Play, mini- games can be played at the player's own pace, with each mini-game being unlocked daily. This mode allows for multiplayer, a new feature to the series. In Daily Training, the player has full access to a selection of puzzles, unlocking more puzzles the more days they play. The player can perform a \\"Brain Age Check\\", where the player performs three standard puzzles and their performance determines the \\"age\\" of the brain. Solving the puzzles speedily will result in a younger Brain Age. Once a day the player receives a stamp which allows to play more mini-games. This game features a championship mode, where players connect online to compete with players worldwide. This feature uses Nintendo Switch Online. The championship mode takes place every Saturday, where players have up to two attempts per Daily Training puzzle to solve as fast as they can. The fastest attempt is submitted to the championship, where players are read their results instantly after finishing. Players receive access to online players' performances every Monday. The championship mode also allows the user to send messages to other players and compare their results once a day. Development The Nintendo Switch version was developed by most of the original developers of previous Brain Age games, lead by producer Kouichi Kawamoto, who directed most of the series. Additional development was provided by indieszero. The game was announced on the Nintendo Japan YouTube account on September 30, 2019. Two weeks later, it was announced that the game would come to Europe and Australia on January 3, 2020. On December 27, 2019, the game was released in Japan. It has yet to receive a North American release. Reception The game received mixed reviews. Many praised the puzzles' quality and repeatability as well as the game making good use of Nintendo Switch technology. However, the game was criticised for being too similar to previous installments and a lack of variety. Some noted that the game was not suitable for the recently released Nintendo Switch Lite since the system does not have detachable Joy-Cons or IR sensors. The game had also performed to the same quality of other Nintendo games with an awkward handwriting recognition and limited amount of puzzles. In the UK, sales charts showed that the game was number 14 in physical sales within its first week, the highest it has been in the series.

Black markers show the dates of moveable feasts including Easter on the annual calendar ring. Schwilgu√©‚Äôs computus is on the left. A computus clock is a clock equipped with a mechanism that automatically calculates and displays, or helps determine, the date of Easter (and other dependent dates of moveable Church feasts). A computus watch carries out the same function.  Background  The movement of a computus clock provides and/or calculates astronomical and calendar information according to the tradition that Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon (Paschal or ecclesiastical full moon) on or after the spring equinox (21st March), and Easter Sunday should not occur on the same day as the Jewish calendar date Nisan 15th, the first day of Passover week. In early Christianity, the Easter date was calculated each year and announced by the Pope. The later need for Christian clergy living in different territories to be able to calculate the Easter date for themselves forced attempts to establish clear rules for the Easter date calculation and finally the algorithms for this. The determination of the Easter date requires calculating astronomical and calendar cycles ‚Äì the annual motion of the Sun round the celestial sphere, the evolution of the phases of the Moon, the cycle of the days of the week, particularities of calendars and some agreements like the date of the so-called ecclesiastical equinox.Woodman, C. E. Easter and the Ecclesiastical Calendar. Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Vol. 17, p.141 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1923JRASC..17..141W, designated as March 21st, irrespective of the actual astronomical observation by the Church of Alexandria in the beginning of the 4th Century. Specific astronomical data which may be incorrect, misinterpreted or location dependent, were eliminated from the Easter date calculation by the invention of special paschal functions ‚Äì ‚Äúletters‚Äù and ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù.Determination of Easter date. https://promenade.imcce.fr/en/pages4/442.html They include the ‚Äúgolden number‚Äù (which gives the dates of all the new moons for the year in a 19-year Metonic cycle), the solar cycle (the 28-year cycle of the Julian calendar and 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar with respect to the week), the epact (the age of the Moon in days on a certain date), the dominical letter (used to determine the day of the week for particular dates) and the indiction (the number of a given year in a fifteen-year period). The computations after the Gregorian reform of 1582 should also take into account additional corrections necessary due to particularities of the Gregorian calendar, notably the solar equation (taking into account some non-leap century years) and the lunar equation (for correction of the Metonic cycle)C. Philipp E. Nothaft (2018). Scandalous Error: Calendar Reform and Calendrical Astronomy in Medieval Europe. Oxford University Press. The term ‚Äúcomputus‚Äù as the description of the Easter date computation was proposed in 725 by the English Benedictine monk Bede in his treatise ‚ÄúDe temporum ratione‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Reckoning of Time‚Äù).Bede. The Reckoning of Time. Liverpool University Press, 1999. Translated, with introduction, notes and commentary by Faith Wallis. Alexandrian computus, based on rules established by the Church of Alexandria, was universally used from the beginning of the 8th century until the Gregorian calendar reform of 1582. The Roman Catholic Church has used the Gregorian calendar, and accordingly Gregorian computus, to calculate the dates of Easter since 1583. The Gregorian computus was later adopted by most Protestant churches ‚Äì between 1753 and 1845 ‚Äì while most Eastern Churches, including the majority of Eastern Orthodox Churches and Non-Chalcedonian Churches continued to produce the Easter date computation based on the Julian calendar (Alexandrian computus), although both had and indeed still have some complications, described in detail in dedicated studies. The Alexandrian computus gives a 532-year period of Easter dates. Given that all possible dates on which Easter can occur lie within a 35-day period ‚Äì from March 22nd to April 25th (old style dates) or from April 4th to May 8th (new style dates) ‚Äì the Alexandrian Easter algorithm is equivalent to 18620 options (532 x 35), showing the complexity of computus implementation in a compact clockwork. The Gregorian Easter algorithm gives even more options due to the fact that the duration of the period is 5,700,000 years (70,499,183 lunar months or 2,081,882,250 days). The German mathematician Karl Gauss presented a computus algorithm in 1800Photocopy of the first page of Carl Friedrich Gauss‚Äô article ‚ÄúBerechnung des Osterfestes‚Äù. http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/e/2005/gausscd/html/Osterformel/Seite1.htm and finalized it in 1807 and 1811. Gauss‚Äô algorithm is considered to be the most commonly used and although it was intended for calculating the Easter date for the Gregorian calendar, it is also valid for the calculation of the Easter date for the Julian calendar. The indication of the date of the upcoming Easter is one of the rarest astronomical functions of mechanical clocks and watches due to the high levels of complexity involved. Moreover, there is significant discrepancy in computus algorithms due to the differences of the Julian and Gregorian calendars (Easter controversy). The obvious difficulties in implementing computus algorithms in clockwork explain the fact that in the entire history of mechanical clocks and watchmaking, just a few examples of computus clocks and watches have been made.  Computus clock types  ; Tabular computus clocks Clocks with a tabular computus provide the indication of special paschal (ecclesiastical) functions without the automatic counting of the date of Easter, so the date should be determined by the paschal table with the use of indications - the golden number, the solar cycle, the epact, the dominical letter, and the indiction ‚Äì all or some of which, may be with the addition of other indications. It is believed the first Easter function in a mechanical clock was created by the Italian physician, astronomer and mechanical engineer Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio from Padua. He built his complicated astronomical clock ‚ÄúAstrarium‚Äù from 1348 to 1364. The clock has not survived, but the design and construction were described in detail by Dondi in his manuscriptsGiovanni Dondi dall'Orologio. Tractatus astrarii. Edition critique et la traduction de la version A par Emmanuel Poulle. Librairie Droz S.A. Geneve, 2003. and provided enough material for modern clockmakers to build reconstructions.The list of reconstructions of the Astrarium clock of Giovanni de‚ÄôDondi may be found here: https://www.cabinet.ox.ac.uk/giovanni-dondis-astrarium-1364 While few reconstructions have been made, one example of Dondi‚Äôs computus can be found in the Smithsonian Institution (Washington DC, USA). Dondi‚Äôs computus was based on a device with a wheel drive and three chain indicators of the 7980-year Julian period. The first chain with 28 links was used to indicate the dominical letter and the 28-year solar cycle, the second chain with 19 links was used to indicate the golden number, and the third chain was used for the 15-year cycle of indiction.Silvio A. Bedini, Francis R. Maddison (1966). Mechanical Universe: The Astrarium of Giovanni de‚Äô Dondi. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series vol. 56 (part 5). p. 46. The computus was set under the date display ring, which was designed for a 365-day year (in the leap year, Giovanni de Dondi intended to stop the clock for one day). A tabular computus with indications of the dominical letter, the epact, the 28-year solar cycle, the golden number and the indiction was made by the French clockmaker in his monumental astronomical pendulum clock of Besan√ßon Cathedral (France). Built from 1858 to 1860, the clock‚Äôs epact dial has an additional indication of Easter dates for a period of 19 years on cartouches, which should be replaced or repainted every 19 years by the keeper of the clock. Ecclesiastical functions of the 28-year solar cycle, the Julian epact, the Gregorian epact, the Julian dominical letter, the Gregorian dominical letter, the golden number and the indiction were implemented by the Swiss watchmaker Albert Billeter in his supercomplicated monumental ‚ÄúIvanovo‚Äù Universal Clock, which he made in 1873 in Paris and which is kept in Ivanovo Museum of Industry and Arts (also known as the D.G.Burylin Museum, Ivanovo, Russia).The one and only Universal astronomic clock (in Russian). http://stylarium.ru/technics/69Burylin's clock (in Russian). https://www.mkivanovo.ru/articles/2013/05/15/854279-chasyi-buryilina.html The French clockmaker Paul PouvillonBrief biography of Paul Pouvillon and his clock. http://www.my-time-machines.net/pouvillon_restoration.htm included a computus module in his complicated astronomical clock with orrery,Christie‚Äôs.

The module has a single indicator of the Gregorian Easter date in a window with a disc underneath, stamped with the Easter dates for the 19-year period from 1946 to 1964. The moveable feast‚Äôs indicator is set on the tellurium dial, and its adjustment to correct the dates should be made manually. The computus module has 6 ecclesiastical functions ‚Äì the 28-year solar cycle, the Gregorian epact, the Gregorian dominical letter, the golden number, the indiction and the indication of the day of the week of January 1st of the next year, so the computation of the Easter date may be provided with the help of the ecclesiastical functions even for the years after 1964, when the original Easter date disc is no more valid, as noted during restoration works in 2011‚Äì2012.Notes on restoration of Paul Pouvillon astronomic clock. http://www.my-time- machines.net/pouvillon_restoration1.htm Indications of the 28-year solar cycle, golden number and indiction were used by the Norwegian clockmaker and inventor Rasmus Jonassen S√∏rnes in his complicated astronomical pendulum clock No.4 (S√∏rnes No.4), built from 1958 to 1966. ; Computus clocks with automatic mechanical counting devices The most complicated type of computus clock is rather a kind of mechanical computer making automatic Easter calculations based on ecclesiastical indications at the beginning of a given year. The first computus clock with a fully automatic action was made by the French clockmaker and inventor Jean-Baptiste Schwilgu√©, the author of the third astronomical clock of Strasbourg Cathedral (Strasbourg astronomical clock),Henri Bach, Jean-Pierre Rieb, Robert Wilhelm: Les trois horloges astronomiques de la cath√©drale de Strasbourg, 1992. between 1838 and 1843. In 1816 he invented and built the first prototype of his mechanical computus ‚ÄúComput eccl√©siastique‚Äù, and in 1821 he made the final calculations and design of his device, acting as a Gregorian computus. Schwilgu√© embedded his computus into the astronomical clock of Strasbourg Cathedral, where it continues to operate to this day. It includes 5 ecclesiastical functions ‚Äì the 28-year solar cycle, the Gregorian epact, the Gregorian dominical letter, the golden number and the indiction, with the addition of a 4-digit Gregorian year indicator.Alfred Ungerer, Th√©odore Ungerer: L'horloge astronomique de la cath√©drale de Strasbourg, 1922. At the start of each year, the computus changes the indications of the dates of Easter and moveable feasts on the annual calendar ring of the main dial in the central lower part of the clock.The video of Strasbourg astronomical clock functions, computus function starts at 3:25. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S13P_YfqVLo The Danish clockmaker Jens Olsen, while visiting Strasbourg in 1897, was inspired by Jean-Baptiste Schwilgu√©‚Äôs astronomical clock of Strasbourg Cathedral and in 1924 he completed a separate computus module (‚ÄúComput eccl√©siastique‚Äù), that has certain similarities to Schwilgu√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúComput eccl√©siastique‚Äù. Later, in 1928, Jens Olsen made the calculations of a supercomplicated astronomical computus clock. The clock, known as ‚ÄúWorld Clock‚Äù (in Danish, ‚ÄúVerdensuret‚Äù), was finished in 1955, 10 years after his death, by his colleague Otto Mortensen, who took over the project.Otto Mortensen.

The clock is displayed in Copenhagen‚Äôs R√•dhus (City Hall).Jens Olsen's World Clock. https://cphmuseum.kk.dk/en/artikel/jens-olsens-world-clock The computus of Jens Olsen‚Äôs World Clock has 5 ecclesiastical functions ‚Äì the Gregorian dominical letter, the Gregorian epact, the 28-year solar cycle, the indiction and the golden number, while the clock is also equipped with a Gregorian perpetual calendar indicating the date, day of the week, month and the year in four digits. Beneath the ecclesiastical dials there is an unparalleled tabular calendar showing the dates and days of the week of all 12 months of the year, the phases of the Moon for every date, and the dates of Easter and other moveable feasts. The computus and Gregorian perpetual calendar automatically switch at midnight at New Year to calculate the calendar for the following year. The French clockmaker also took his inspiration from the works of Jean- Baptiste Schwilgu√© and his astronomical clock of Strasbourg Cathedral. Vachey spent thirty years ‚Äì from 1938 to 1968 ‚Äì building his supercomplicated astronomical computus clock.Description of Daniel Marius Vachey astronomic computus clock. http://www.patrimoine-horloge.fr/as-vachey.html The computus of the clock has 5 ecclesiastical functions ‚Äì the Gregorian dominical letter, the Gregorian epact, the 28-year solar cycle, the indiction and the golden number. The clock is also equipped with a dial for 6 moveable feasts and a perpetual calendar with date, day of the week, month and bissextile year indicators. ; Computus clock with opto-mechanical indication The Easter date in a computus clock with an opto-mechanical indication is shown by the superposition of the matching holes of perforated discs. This type of display, designed to indicate the date of Orthodox Easter, was invented by Russian watchmaker in 2005 (patent RU2306618Patent RU2306618 ¬´Calendar mechanism to calculate the Orthodox Easter date and dates of moveable feasts (vessions)¬ª (in Russian) (published: 20.09.2007). https://new.fips.ru/iiss/document.xhtml?faces- redirect=true&id;=f3d1b0b2bbaa72b581398781243f978d was published on September 20th 2007). An opto-mechanical Easter date display was built into his ‚ÄúEaster of Christ Computus Clock‚Äù clock of 2005, the first computus clock of this type. ; Orthodox computus clocks A mechanical Orthodox computus was invented by the Russian watchmaker Konstantin Chaykin in 2007 (patent RU2353978Patent RU2353978 ¬´Calendar mechanism to calculate the Orthodox Easter date¬ª (in Russian) (published: 27.04.2009). https://new.fips.ru/iiss/document.xhtml?faces- redirect=true&id;=3974b3e395fa0639e4808a038e6a2d43 was published on April 27th 2009). For the computus mechanism he developed his own version of computus algorithm, that differs from Carl Friedrich Gauss‚Äôs algorithm. The computus mechanism mechanically calculates the Orthodox Easter date at midnight at New Year and sets the calendar for the following year by means of three cam wheels, springs, levers, racks and three differential gears. In total, the computus mechanism consists of more than 300 parts. His Orthodox computus has been used in a series of astronomical desk clocks ‚Äì the ‚ÄúResurrection Computus Clock‚Äù (2007), the ‚ÄúNorthern Computus Clock‚Äù (2015) and the supercomplicated ‚ÄúMoscow Computus Clock‚Äù (2016). ; Computus clock/watch with a program cam wheel mechanism This type of computus mechanism does not provide a mechanical calculation of the Easter date, but shows it by means of a program cam wheel, since the complicated design of a counting computus makes it difficult to integrate into the compact movement of a pocket watch and, in particular, a wristwatch. The only known example of a pocket watch with an indication of the Easter date according to the Gregorian calendar is the supercomplication ‚ÄúCalibre 89‚Äù pocket watch by the Swiss company Patek Philippe. Four copies of the ‚ÄúCalibre 89‚Äù and one functioning prototype were made in 1989 (the prototype is stored in the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva,Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva (Switzerland). https://www.patek.com/en/company/patek- philippe-museum Switzerland). The Easter date display uses a program cam wheel valid for 28 years. It is assumed that this will be replaced as each term for its correct operation expires. An extended program cam wheel mechanism was used in the display of the Easter date in the monumental astronomical clock of Beauvais Cathedral (France), built by the French clockmaker Auguste-Lucien V√©rit√© from 1865 to 1868. The cam wheel is calculated for a period of 300 years,¬´Le cercle ainsi divis√© n‚Äôest qu‚Äôune sorte le calendrier perp√©tuel sur lequel, chaque ann√©e, les f√™tes mobiles viendront s‚Äôaccuser chaqune √† son jour.

A separated computus module  Separated computus module is produced to demonstrate the principle action of a computus device of a clock, to try and check the complicated mechanism. Separated modules are quite remarkable because just a few examples have ever been produced. The world‚Äôs first computus module, realizing the Gregorian computus algorithm, was invented, designed and made by the French clockmaker Jean-Baptiste Schwilgu√© (‚ÄúComput eccl√©siastique‚Äù, 1821, which was stolen from Strasbourg Cathedral in 1944, with the present location unknown). Subsequently, separated computus modules were made by the Danish clockmaker Jens Olsen (also called ‚ÄúComput eccl√©siastique‚Äù; 1924), and by the French watchmaker Fr√©d√©ric Klinghammer, who reproduced Schwilgu√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúComput eccl√©siastique‚Äù in a reduced scale (‚ÄúComput de Klinghammer‚Äù; 1977). The Russian watchmaker Konstantin Chaykin made an Orthodox computus module (‚ÄúComput Orthodoxe‚Äù) in 2007 to demonstrate the principle action of the mechanical Orthodox computus he had invented.

The movie is based on Shekhar Tamhane's famous play of the same name, which starred late actress Reema Lagoo. Synopsis After 8 years of marriage, life of a married couple turns upside down when the wife begins to exhibit alarming behaviour. Her husband tries to find whether she suffers from a personality disorder or something more sinister. Sharad and Kussum Abhyankar are a loving couple married for 8 years, and both partners are successful. However, the couple has been childless and Kussum has been complaining of excruciating stomachaches from time to time for the past 8 years. Eventually, Sharad discovers that Kussum is being possessed by the spectre of Savita Damodar Paranjpe. Flashbacks reveal that Sharad and Savita were great friends. Savita used to flirt with Sharad, but he didn't take it seriously. Sharad fell in love with Savita's best friend Kussum and their parents consented to the marriage. Savita was unable to accept this turn of events and her love for Sharad transformed into an obsession. Sharad vehemently spurned Savita's advances and she immolated herself. Sharad silently blamed himself for Savita's death and since then, remained slightly distant from Kussum, leaving her sexually frustrated. It is revealed that Kussum's miscarriages are being caused by Savita. While possessing Kussum, Savita expressed her desire to sleep with Sharad's friend, Ashok, to sow discord in Sharad's marriage. Kussum, Ashok, and Sharad oppose this. Devastated on learning the whole truth, Kussum decides to immolate herself to end the misery. However Sharad prevents her and tells Savita that although he acknowledges her love, she must respect his marriage to Kussum. Savita leaves Kussum and everyone rejoices. However, Sharad is suspicious that Savita would give up so easily. The movie ends with Sharad discovering that Savita has possessed his younger sister Neetu, and his troubles are far from over.

He joined the Navy as a Garde- Marine in 1741, and took part in the Battle of Toulon at Cape Sici√© on 22‚Äì23 February 1744, serving on the 50-gun Diamant. In 1745, he served on Trident and Esp√©rance in two missions to Martinique. In 1746, he was on Castor and took part in the capture of the British corvette Albany off Acadia. The year after, he was taken prisoner at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre on 14 May 1747. Chabert was promoted to Ensign in 1748. In 1750 and 1751, Chabert conducted a survey of the coasts of Northern America.

Chabert was promoted to Commander in 1764. On 2 April 1771, Chabert was given command of the frigate Mignonne, and conducted a cruise to test a chronometer made by Ferdinand Berthoud. Upon his return, in late November, Chabert was promoted to Captain. From June to December 1776, he commanded the 32-gun frigate Atalante in an expedition to test marine chronometers and survey the coasts of Sicily and Greece. On 16 July, off the Mani Peninsula, near Koroni, pirates attacked Atalante with musket fire, and Chabert was gravely wounded when a bullet struck his left cheek and exited from under the ear. In 1778, Chabert captained the 64-gun Vaillant in the squadron of D'Estaing. He took part in the Battle of St. Lucia on 15 December 1778, and in the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779. On 28 August 1779, D'Estaing's squadron arrived at Boston, and Chabert installed mortars on Gallops Island for the defence of Boston harbour. In October, Chabert took part in the Siege of Savannah. Chabert captained the 80-gun Saint-Esprit in the squadron under De Grasse.

History  No sector was more affected by violence during the years of the Guatemalan Civil War than the country's peasant population. The war left unprecedented death and destruction throughout the countryside, generating, among other reactions, the massive flight of thousands of Guatemalan peasants. In the period 1981‚Äì82, in which more than four hundred towns and villages were razed and thousands of Guatemalans killed, the reaction of the survivors caught between the two forces was to flee, put themselves under the control of the Guatemalan Army and be forced to participate in the Civil Defense Patrols (PAC), or be relocated to the \\"model villages\\" where they were concentrated. Some fifty thousand totally dispossessed people escaped to jungle areas of El Quich√©, spending those years hidden from the outside world and out of government control. A decade later, about half were still there, although the Army's offensives between 1987 and 1989 drove some 5,000 people out. Later others settled on their own outside the CPRs, north of Uspant√°n. In mid-1992, there were about seventeen thousand inhabitants of the Sierra CPRs and about six thousand in Ixc√°n, or a total of approximately twenty-three thousand people. The CPRs of Ixc√°n were made up of mostly K ºiche º people, while in the Sierra communities they were mostly Ixil people, as well as Ladino people. The communities visited highlighted the coexistence on an equal footing of its members from all backgrounds. In January 1994, the CPRs of Ixc√°n made public their intention to settle peacefully from February 2 in their previous locations between the Ixc√°n and Xalbal rivers on the lands of the Ixc√°n Grande Cooperative, whose members are mostly members of the CPR, and invited the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to monitor the situation. On March 9 and 10, 1994, the Quich√© CPRs were visited by members of the Ibero-American Commission on Human Rights (IDEH); the communities visited were Santiaguito, San Luis, San Francisco, Los Altos and La Esperanza, (Ixc√°n) and the CPRs in Cab√° and Santa Clara (Sierra). The commission also visited nearby towns in Centro Veracruz, (Ixc√°n) and Asunci√≥n del Cop√≥n (Sierra), as well as some of the CPR's workers and interviewed military patrols operating in those territories. During these trips, the Delegation was also able to observe other populations in the area, as well as the various barracks that were abandoned by the Army.  Lost communities  The lost communities were spontaneous isolated communities, which were outside the CPR system but close to them in practically isolated areas of El Quich√© and Alta Verapaz, and which were in terrible living conditions. These populations consciously decided to relocate to remote areas not affected by the insurgency and to develop their lives beyond the reach of the various armed groups, developing a subsistence economy and avoiding drawing public attention. Some of the families that comprised them have been part of the CPR in the past and decided to relocate outside the conflict zone.

In 1971, the Q ºeqchi º indigenous people were evicted from the area around Cancu√©n, because it was considered to have oil; the army was used to evict 24 villages from the area. Since 1974, crude oil had been commercially exploited in the vicinity of the Northern Transversal Strip (FTN) as a result of the discoveries made by the oil companies Basic Resources and Shenandoah Oil, which jointly operated in the Rubelsanto oil field in Alta Verapaz. In 1976, when President Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garc√≠a came to visit the Mayal√°n cooperative in the Ixc√°n sector - which had been first populated just ten years earlier - he said: \\"Mayal√°n is sitting on top of gold\\", hinting that the Northern Transversal Strip would no longer be dedicated to agriculture or the cooperative movement, but would instead be used for strategic objectives of natural resource exploitation. After that presidential visit, both oil companies carried out explorations in the lands of Xalbal, very close to Mayal√°n in Ixc√°n, where they drilled the ‚ÄúSan Lucas‚Äù well with unsuccessful results. Those explorations, which opened the way for future oil experiments in Ixc√°n, and the rest of the FTN, were also the main reason for the construction of a dirt road that runs through the Strip. Shenandoah Oil, the National Institute of Agrarian Transformation (INTA) and the Army Engineers Battalion coordinated to build that corridor between 1975 and 1979, which ultimately allowed powerful politicians, military and businessmen of the time to take over many of the lands where the potential timber and oil wealth lay. Senior Guatemalan officials then became large landowners and investors, taking advantage of the migration of peasants, access to privileged information, expansion of public credit, and large development projects; the army even entered the business world, launching the Army Bank. After the civil war, the FTN was abandoned, but oil exploration continued.

Exercise is a bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. Physical activity is number one most common health issue in the world. Staying physically active can help prevent or delay certain diseases, including some cancers, heart disease and diabetes, and also relieve depression and improve mood. A research Physical Activity Fundamental to Preventing Disease published by U.S. Department of Health & Human Services claims that virtually all individuals can benefit from regular physical activity, whether they participate in vigorous exercise or some type of moderate health-enhancing physical activity.  Immediate benefits  = Brain activity = The benefits of physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise, have positive effects on brain function on multiple fronts, ranging from the molecular to behavioral level. According to a study done by the Department of Exercise Science at the University of Georgia, even briefly exercising for 20 minutes facilitates information processing and memory functions. Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts. It increases heart rate, which pumps more oxygen to the brain. It also aids the bodily release of a plethora of hormones, all of which participate in aiding and providing a nourishing environment for the growth of brain cells. Exercise stimulates the brain plasticity by stimulating growth of new connections between cells in a wide array of important cortical areas of the brain. Research from UCLA demonstrated that exercise increased growth factors in the brain‚Äîmaking it easier for the brain to grow new neuronal connections. Some benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include improved thinking or cognition for children 6 to 13 years of age and reduced short-term feelings of anxiety for adults. Regular physical activity can help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of depression and anxiety and help you sleep better. = Weight management = Both diet and physical activity play a critical role in maintaining a healthy body weight, losing excess body weight, or maintaining successful weight loss. Physical activity helps control weight by using excess calories that would otherwise be stored as fat. Most foods we eat contain calories, and everything we do uses calories, including sleeping, breathing, and digesting food. Balancing the calories we eat with the calories we use through physical activity will help us reach and maintain a healthy weight.  Long-term benefits  The most common health risks include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 2 and some cancers. Obesity is a complex disease that affects whole body metabolism and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical exercise results in numerous health benefits and is an important tool to combat obesity and its co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease. Exercise prevents both the onset and development of cardiovascular disease and is an important therapeutic tool to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Some benefits of exercise include enhanced mitochondrial function, restoration and improvement of vasculature, and the release of myokines from skeletal muscle that preserve or augment cardiovascular function. In this review we will discuss the mechanisms through which exercise promotes cardiovascular health. Regular physical exercise has several beneficial effects on overall health. While decreasing body mass and adiposity are not the primary outcomes of exercise, exercise can mediate several diseases that accompany obesity including T2D and CVD. Several recent studies have shown that sustained physical activity is associated with decreased markers of inflammation, improved metabolic health, decreased risk of heart failure, and improved overall survival. There are several risk factors leading to the development and progression of CVD, but one of the most prominent is a sedentary lifestyle. A sedentary lifestyle can be characterized by both obesity and consistently low levels of physical activity. Thus, lifestyle interventions that aim to increase physical activity and decrease obesity are attractive therapeutic methods to combat most non-congenital types of CVD. = Cardiovascular Risk Factors = Regular physical exercise is associated with numerous health benefits to reduce the progression and development of obesity, T2D, and CVD. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions including moderate exercise and a healthy diet improve cardiovascular health in at-risk populations. Individuals with metabolic syndrome who participated in a 4 month program of either a diet (caloric restriction) or exercise intervention had reduced adiposity, decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, and lower total and low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lipid profiles compared to the control group. Both the diet and exercise intervention improve these cardiovascular outcomes to a similar extent. Several previous studies have investigated the effects of diet and exercise, independently or in combination, on metabolic and cardiovascular health and have determined that diet, exercise, or a combination of diet and exercise induces weight loss, decreases visceral adiposity, lowers plasma triglycerides, plasma glucose, HDL levels, and blood pressure, and improves VO2max. Importantly, several of these beneficial effects of exercise are evident independent of weight loss. Studies have shown that exercise can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health independent of changes in body weight, including improved glucose homeostasis, endothelial function, blood pressure, and HDL levels. These data indicate exercise, independent of changes in body mass, results in significant improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic health. Although a detailed analysis of the vast impact of diet on cardiometabolic health is outside the scope of this review, the importance of diet and exercise in tandem should not be ignored, as many studies have shown that cardiometabolic health is improved to a higher extent in response to a combined diet and exercise programs compared to either intervention alone. Exercise has a similar effect on cardiovascular improvements in lean and overweight normoglycemic subjects. In a 1 year study of non-obese individuals, a 16‚Äì20% increase in energy expenditure (of any form of exercise) with no diet intervention resulted in a 22.3% decrease in body fat mass and reduced LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and C-reactive protein concentrations, all risk factors associated with CVD. In overweight individuals, 7‚Äì9 months of low-intensity exercise (walking ~19 km per week at 40‚Äì55% VO2peak) significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness compared to sedentary individuals. Together these data indicate that exercise interventions decrease the risk or severity of CVD in subjects who are lean, obese, or have type 2 diabetes. = Cardiac rehabilitation = Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1‚Äì47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an acute myocardial infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms. One defining characteristic of heart failure is exercise intolerance, which resulted in a prescription of bed rest for these patients until the 1950s. However, it has now been shown that a monitored rehabilitation program using moderate intensity exercise is safe for heart failure patients, and this has now become an important therapeutic for patients with heart failure. Meta-analyses and systemic reviews have shown that exercise training in heart failure patients is associated with improved quality of life, reduced risk of hospitalization and decreased rates of long-term mortality. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60‚Äì70% of heart rate reserve 3‚Äì5 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire). Other studies have shown that exercise-based rehabilitation at a moderate intensity in heart failure patients improves cardiorespiratory fitness and increases both exercise endurance capacity and VO2max (12‚Äì31% increase). More recent studies have examined the effects of high-intensity exercise on patients with heart failure. A recent study found that 12 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in heart failure patients (with reduced ejection fraction) was well-tolerated and had similar benefits compared to patients who underwent moderate continuous exercise (MCE) training, including improved left ventricular remodeling and aerobic capacity. A separate study found that 4 weeks of HIIT in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction improved VO2peak and reduced diastolic dysfunction compared to both pre-training values and compared to the MCE group. These studies indicate that both moderate and high intensity exercise training improve cardiovascular function in heart failure patients, likely related to increased endothelium- dependent vasodilation and improved aerobic capacity.  Other benefits  = Bones and muscles= Routine physical activity is important for building strong bones and muscles in children, but it is equally important as we get older. Your bones and muscles work together to support every movement you make on a daily basis. When you are physically active you strengthen your muscles. Your bones adapt by building more cells and as a result both become stronger. Strong bones and muscles protect against injury and improves balance and coordination. In addition active adults experience less joint stiffness and improved flexibility. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result. Even if you have arthritis, exercise that keeps the muscles around the joint strong can act like a brace that will react to every move you make without the hassle of an actual brace that you have to put on and take off. = Daily activity = The ability to perform daily activities and maintain independence requires strong muscles, balance and endurance. Regular physical activity or exercise helps to improve and prevent the decline of muscle strength, balance and endurance, all risk factors for falling. Balance plays an important role in everyday activities such as walking, getting up out of a chair or leaning over to pick up a grandchild. Balance problems can reduce your independence by interfering with activities of daily living. The good news is that participating in regular physical activity can significantly improve balance and reduce your risk for falling. = Mental health = Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Exercise is also a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in our brain that energize our spirits and make us feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing us to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression. = Sleep = Exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may promote falling asleep. Exercise may also reduce insomnia by decreasing arousal, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Insomnia is commonly linked with elevated arousal, anxiety, and depression, and exercise has strong effects on reducing these symptoms in the general population. These issues count among the most common among most of population. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year.

Origin The founder of what became the House of Qui√±ones was an Asturian nobleman named Pedro Alvarez Qui√±ones, who is first seen in the mid 12th-century as tenente (Lord) of Luna and lord of the village of Qui√±ones del r√≠o in Le√≥n.

McHale (1928‚Äì1989) was an American politician who led the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture from January 1971 to December 1975. Career McHale was born in western Pennsylvania, near Ohio, in 1928. His biological father died in 1933, when McHale was five years old. McHale's mother remarried, to the veterinarian David Royer, in 1937. Royer acquired a farm in Jamestown, Pennsylvania, when McHale was nine, where McHale began working. Aged 15, McHale started working with another farmer, Don Leach. Though McHale had planned to attend veterinary school upon graduating from high school, Leach offered to sell his dairy farm to McHale. After securing loans from his parents, McHale bought Leach's operation. Soon after that, McHale married his first wife, with whom he had five children. On the advice of local agricultural publications, McHale expanded his farming operations. However, this caused McHale to fall into severe debt. In 1957, McHale and other local farmers invested in bulk production and began selling their product to Beverly Farms, the only company in the area equipped to handle bulk production. As milk prices fell, McHale organized a three-week strike in August 1959, as Local 205 of the Teamsters Union. After discovering that he and local farmers were not being paid the price set by the Pennsylvania milk marketing board, McHale met with an attorney, F. Joseph Thomas. Subsequent meetings drew an attendance of 400 farmers, and the collective became the Western Pennsylvania Milk Producers Association. Soon, McHale switched political affiliations from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. In 1961, McHale met with a representative of the National Farmers Union, who called United States Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman and arranged for McHale and Thomas to attended a meeting of agricultural organizations in Washington, D.C. Following the meeting, McHale recruited 1,200 members for the National Farmers Union during the summer. Later, McHale opted to sell his dairy farm and invest in a grain farm, so he could have more time for union work. He divested entirely from farming in 1967, and acquired a new operation in 1973. McHale was appointed to lead the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture on January 5, 1971. There, he met and later married Jane Alexander, who was named a deputy secretary of agriculture in 1972. He stepped down from the office in December 1975, and began an advisership to Governor Milton Shapp's administration, as Special Coordinator for Rural Planning and Programs. McHale was later a consultant for the Appalachain Regional Commission. Upon retirement from public service, McHale became president of J&J; Agri-Products and Services Inc., in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. McHale died, aged 61, on June 6, 1989, at home in York Springs, Pennsylvania.

Biography =Journalistic Studies= Son of the doctor Juan Gilberto Iberico and the nurse Mar√≠a Luisa N√∫√±ez Garc√≠a, he was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where his parents worked. He was barely a year old when his family returned to Peru. He studied at the Colegio Santa Margarita. In 1976, he entered the National University of San Marcos to study psychology, but after a year he opted for journalism, going on to study communications at the University of Lima. He also majored in economics at the Ricardo Palma University. He decided to complete his journalism studies at the Jaime Bausate y Meza University's School of Journalism, where he graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism. He completed a master's degree in journalism at the Universidad de San Martin de Porres. =Career= He began his journalistic career in 1984, working at various Lima newspapers (El Observador, La Noticia, Hoy), as an editor and political columnist. Then he joined Frecuencia Latina (Channel 2), as a reporter for the 90 Seconds program (1985). As the main reporter and political interviewer, he switched to the Contrapunto program (1989). Of his reports, those related to the fight against terrorism stood out. In 1995, he covered the Cenepa war. Between 1995 and 1996 he ventured into the production of ecological documentaries. In June 1996, he assumed the direction of Contrapunto. Under his leadership, the program focused on the allegations of corruption and human rights violations during the government of Alberto Fujimori, which led to the government's intervention against Channel 2 and its main shareholder, Baruch Ivcher. This was materialized with the unconstitutional withdrawal of the Peruvian nationality of said businessman and the taking of this means of communication by minority shareholders Samuel and Mendel Winter. In response to this outrage, Iberico and key Channel 2 journalists quit the company.http://www.congreso.gob.pe/Docs/participacion/museo/congreso/files/files/luis_iberico.pdf He was hired by Astros Producciones (Channel 13), with the project of a new journalistic program, but it proved to be a failure. He subsequently hired as Press Director of ATV (Channel 9), where he lasted til early 2000. Later it became known, thanks to ONE OF the notorious \\"Vladivideos\\", that the channel's manager, Julio Vera Abad, agreed to government pressure to withdraw the journalistic programs on Channel 9, in exchange for a substantial cash payment. In 1998, together with Fernando Via√±a, he founded the newspaper Referendum, which closed after a year, again due to government manipulation through the National Intelligence Service (SIN) led by Vladimiro Montesinos. In 1999, together with Fernando Via√±a and C√©sar Hildebrandt, he started the Liberaci√≥n newspaper, which became the only written press that stood up to the fight against the regime. =Political career= In the wake of Alberto Fujimori's third re-election campaign, Iberico decided to fully delve into politics. In 2000, he was elected to the Peruvian Congress with the Independent Moralizing Front, obtaining a majority of 97,399 votes. He participated in the popular protest called \\"Marcha de los Cuatro Suyos\\" on 28 July 2000, the same day that Fujimori was inaugurating his third term as president. From his seat in Congress, Iberico continued his fight against the government and presented motions in order to investigate Vladimiro Montesinos. In August, along with Fernando Olivera Vega, Gonzalo Carriquiry and Francisco Palacios, he undertook the maneuver that would contribute to the downfall of the regime. Iberico contacted those who offered him the video showing Montesinos delivering money to opposition congressman Alberto Kouri, so that he would switch to the ruling party. On 14 September 2000, the video was shown at a press conference at the Hotel Bolivar, its impact being of such magnitude that it finally undermined the regime. Successively, Montesinos fled, Fujimori's resigned from Japan and a transitional government was established, led by Valent√≠n Paniagua. Iberico's term would be shortened to 2000‚Äì2001.https://andina.pe/agencia/noticia-kourimontesinos-video-hizo-caer-a- un-regimen-interactivo-725162.aspx In 2001, Iberico was reelected to Congress, with a majority of 144,671 votes. From August 2001 to July 2002 he served as Fifth Vice President of the Congress. He failed to attain reelection in 2006, as the Independent Moralizing Front gained 1.5% of the popular vote, and no seats for the new congressional term. The party would be ultimately disbanded, and Iberico switched back to journalism.http://blogs.ubc.ca/peru/2006/02/09/fernando-olivera-declino- candidatura-a-la-presidencia/http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_8336-544-4-30.pdf In 2010, Iberico was invited to join the Alliance for Progress party, and was selected as its Mayor of Lima nominee for the 2010 municipal elections. Though he would only garner 1% of the popular vote, his presence catapulted him for a third term in Congress, being elected in 2011 under the Alliance for the Great Change coalition, obtaining a majority of 53,494 votes.https://portal.jne.gob.pe/portal_documentos/files/procesoselectorales/Documentos%20%20Procesos%20electorales/Elecciones%20Generales%202011/JNE%20congresistas%202011%20final.pdf Once again in Congress, he represented Lima in the PPC-APP parliamentary group. Under Fredy Ot√°rola's congressional leadership, Iberico served as Second Vice President of Congress. As Ot√°rola was appointed Minister of Labor by president Ollanta Humala on 22 July 2014, and First Vice President Carmen Omonte was unable to succeed him for the remainder of the term, Iberico assumed the interim presidency of Congress, for three days, from 22 to 26 July 2014.https://gestion.pe/peru/politica/luis-iberico-asume-presidencia-interina- congreso-66412-noticia/ Iberico was ultimately elected President of Congress for the 2015‚Äì2016 term, defeating Vicente Zeballos in the challenge with a tally of 70 votes against 55.https://elcomercio.pe/politica/congreso/luis- iberico-nuevo-presidente-congreso-184837-noticia/ In 2016, Iberico ran once again for reelection for the Alliance for Progress coalition, but failed after being surpassed in the vote count by 35 votes by congressman and evangelical leader Julio Rosas.https://elcomercio.pe/politica/elecciones/elecciones-2016-julio-rosas- gana-curul-luis-iberico-395907-noticia/ In the following months, president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski appointed him Ambassador to Italy, serving in the position from September 2016 to November 2018.https://gestion.pe/peru/politica/cancilleria-designa-luis-iberico-nuevo- embajador-peru-italia-147987-noticia/ He would ultimately return to Congress on 8 May 2020, as general Edwin Donayre was ousted and left the Alliance for Progress bench with one vacant-seat.

The team lost every game with only one being remotely close. Former captain Edmund Magner served as coach for the season but after the disastrous results there was little surprise that this was his only season behind the bench.Men's Hockey - Year-by-Year, Cornell University, retrieved August 1, 2010.

He worked at the company for thirty years, retiring in 2017. On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that Slaoui would manage the U.S. government's development of a vaccine used to treat coronavirus disease in Operation Warp Speed. Early life and education Slaoui was born on July 22, 1959, in Agadir, Morocco. His father worked in the irrigation business, and died when Slaoui was a teenager, leaving his mother to raise him and his four siblings. Slaoui graduated from Mohammed V High School in Casablanca. In 1976, Slaoui left Morocco at age 17 to study medicine in France but missed the registration deadline due to new registration procedures and his mother being ill. He enrolled at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, where he received a BS in biology and then a MS. During this time he was very politically active. In 1983, Slaoui earned a PhD in molecular biology and immunology from the Free University of Brussels. His thesis was titled Etude de la diversit√© et de la s√©lection des r√©pertoires idiotypiques dans le syst√®me immunitaire. Slaoui's doctoral advisor was immunologist Jacques Urbain. Slaoui took postgraduate courses at Harvard Medical School and the Tufts University School of Medicine, without earning degrees there. In 1998, he received an accelerated MBA from the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne, Switzerland. Career After receiving his PhD, Slaoui moved to the United States with his girlfriend, who was doing post-doctoral research on influenza. She got a position at SmithKline-RIT (which would later become part of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)) and Slaoui got a job teaching immunology at the University of Mons in Belgium. Slaoui co-authored more than 100 research papers. In April 2013, he co-wrote a paper with several other GSK heads that introduced the term \\"electroceutical\\" to broadly encompass medical devices that use electrical, mechanical, or light stimulation to affect electrical signaling in relevant tissue types. In July 2013, he wrote an op-ed in the Huffington Post titled \\"It‚Äôs Time to Further Incentivize Medical Innovation\\", in which he outlined three recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical industry. =GlaxoSmithKline= Slaoui (far right) at a GSK event in December 2016 In 1988, after consulting for SmithKline-RIT for three years, Slaoui joined the company as a vaccine researcher. In 2006, he was appointed head of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, succeeding Tachi Yamada. In 2007, he announced plans to establish a neurosciences research group in Shanghai that would employ a thousand scientists and cost $100 million; it ceased operations in August 2017. In 2008, Slaoui led the $720 million acquisition of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which folded in 2013. In 2012, he oversaw GSK's purchase of Human Genome Sciences for over $3 billion. The Slaoui Center for Vaccines Research in Rockville, Maryland‚Äînamed after Slaoui and GSK's first research and development institute in the United States‚Äîwas opened on December 14, 2016. Slaoui spent thirty years working at GSK. During his time there, Slaoui oversaw the development of numerous vaccines, including Cervarix to prevent cervical cancer, Rotarix to prevent gastroenteritis in children, and an Ebola vaccine. He also spent 27 years researching on a malaria vaccine, Mosquirix, that was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2015 and touted as the first in the world. In 2016, he discussed GSK's development of bioelectronic medicine. Slaoui left GSK on June 30, 2017. In September 2017, he joined European venture capital firm Medicxi. =COVID-19 pandemic= Slaoui in the White House Rose Garden, May 15, 2020 On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump officially announced Operation Warp Speed, a project to develop and deliver 300 million doses of a vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 by January 2021. Operation Warp Speed was managed by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner with the support of the United States Department of Defense and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Slaoui, who called the time frame of 12 to 18 months \\"very aggressive\\" but \\"achievable\\", was named as the chief adviser of the project, working alongside chief operating officer and four-star general Gustave F. Perna. Other candidates for Slaoui's position reportedly included Elias Zerhouni and Arthur Levinson. President Trump described Slaoui as \\"one of the most respected men in the world in the production and, really, on the formulation of vaccines\\", while Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar praised him as \\"arguably the world‚Äôs most experienced and successful vaccine developer\\". To avoid a conflict of interest, Slaoui resigned from the board of the Massachusetts-based biotech firm Moderna, which had been developing a vaccine for the coronavirus. Slaoui faced criticism, particularly from Senator Elizabeth Warren, for continuing to have Moderna stock options worth over $10 million. On May 18, 2020, Slaoui resigned from the board of manufacturing firm Lonza, which Moderna had partnered with to develop a coronavirus vaccine. On May 19, after initially denying a conflict of interest, Slaoui divested his Moderna stock and donated the value it had gained from May 14 onwards to cancer research. On May 20, The New York Times reported that Slaoui had also resigned as an adviser to Brii Biosciences, a firm with sizeable Chinese investments, and would be resigning from Artizan Biosciences and Clazado. According to Michael Caputo, Slaoui's decision to retain his GSK stock, even after being announced as Operation Warp Speed's chief adviser, was cleared by the Department of Health and Human Services. Slaoui was scheduled to speak at the annual Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) conference on June 9, 2020, but ultimately pulled out, citing his failure to brief Congress beforehand. Personal life Slaoui is a Muslim and is fluent in Arabic, English, and French. Slaoui has three sons. Slaoui's younger sister died at a young age from pertussis. One of his two younger brothers and pediatrician, Amine, died from pancreatic cancer. His other brother, Mohamed, is a specialist in gastroenterology and his older sister, Hadia, is a university professor of French literature in Morocco.

Location  The park covers a rectangular area, by , surrounded by Kujawska, Toru≈Ñska and general Stanis≈Çawa Grzmot- Skotnickiego streets, in the Wolno≈õci Hill district () of Bydgoszcz. The park is laid on two hills, south of the city, to above the Brda river valley. The lower elevation can be accessed by climbing stairs either from Kujawska street in the west or from Toru≈Ñska Street in the east. Conversely, many path and trails lead to the upper hillock. In the western area of the park has been built in 2001 the seat of the local television channel TVP3 Bydgoszcz.  History  The park was founded in 1911‚Äì1913, by incorporating the existing natural forest standing on the southern hilly terrain of Bromberg, geologically designated as urstromtal. The park was designed as a mountain forest area, recalling the Tatra mountains. At its inception, it covered . Bydgoszcz Bismarck Tower ca 1915 On May 25, 1913, a Bismarck tower was unveiled in the park, based on a design by Paul Walther, an architect from Berlin. This Bismarck Turm gave its name to the elevation as Bismarck Hill (). The massive squat stone building was high; it housed, among others, a memorial room to Otto von Bismarck who died in 1898, and its highest observation deck offered a remarkable panorama over the entire city. At the recreation of Polish state, the edifice, stripped from its commemorative plaques, was renamed Freedom Tower (), giving the name to the site as Park on Wolno≈õci Hill. A controversial project of converting the tower into a chapel crowned by a grand cross was drawn: the polemic raised by the scheme added to its cost led to the dismissal of the plan. On April 12, 1928, Bydgoszcz city council passed a contentious resolution on the liquidation of the tower. A month later (May 16), the ex-Bismarck tower was blown up using 30 tons of TNT. Nowadays, the only elements left of this building are the stairs from Toru≈Ñska street (between 86 and 88) and the cemented square platform in the Cemetery of Bydgoszcz Heroes. The years following, the park was redesigned by planting pines and silver birches. In 1938, an inventory listed the following species growing in the park: * Bog pines; * Norway spruces; * Silver birches; * Siberian dwarf pines; * Savin junipers. During the occupation, Nazis authorities restored the name Bismarckh√∂he, while the trail and the park, called H√∂henweg, extended farther east, reaching present day's Aleja Jana Paw≈Ça II. After World War II, the Cemetery of Bydgoszcz Heroes was set up in the middle of the park to gather all the victims of executions from the city and its surroundings. Bench with a view on the old town From 1974 to 1980, on the eastern side of the park, the provincial hospital Jan Biziel has been erected. Today, the path does not go further east, wandering between too many private properties. A revitalization project was prepared in 2016 and carried out between 2017 and 2019, associated to an EU funding. Works included, among others: * planting meadows, trees, shrubs, herbs and flowers (681 species in total); * installing small architecture elements (e.g. benches, information boards, nest boxes for birds and bats); * replacing the lighting system; * building new paths for pedestrian and bicycles. The project also comprised the construction of new stairs leading down to Kujawska street. Bydgoszcz council officially bestowed to the park the name Park Wolno≈õci thanks to a resolution passed on June 26, 2019.  An element in the historic green ensemble of the city southern hill  As early as the mid-19th century, the park was subsumed in a larger ensemble located on the southern hilly side of Bromberg. It represented a long walking trail, albeit partially interrupted, from where you could appreciate the panorama upon the city. At that time, the ring of hills was crisscrossed by dry creeks and paths leading the parks. They were identified through time as: * Park on Prince hill () (est. 1834), located between present day Lubelska and Seminaryjna streets. On June 15, 1835, Frederick William IV of Prussia, then crown prince to the Prussian throne, paid a visit to the park, giving it its name. Surviving plots can be found today along the green slope facing Seminaryjna street; The old water tower at Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park * Park on Naumann Hill (est. 1870), located between Szubi≈Ñska, Seminaryjna and Wysoka streets. This park was created by Johann Gottlieb Naumann who was at the time president of Bromberg administrative region and chairman of the Society for the Embellishment of Bromberg. He gave his name to the height (). In 1907, the park was divided between the newly built Catholic seminary and the deaconesses hospital established in 1885 (today's Regional Pulmonology Center); * Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park, called Park on Wissmann hill till 1920; * Aleja G√≥rska, created in 1890 under the name Circular park (); * Park on Wolno≈õci Hill (1913); * Viewing points trails along hills on Wy≈ºyny and Kapu≈õciska districts (1950‚Äì1980). Today, the path along Bydgoszcz hilly southern slopes offers a panorama of the city from Henryk DƒÖbrowski Park to Aleja G√≥rska and Kujawska street. The trail continues east, up the stairs to the current park, reaching Jan Biziel hospital: further eastern segments of this panorama walking path are located in Wy≈ºyny and Kapu≈õciska districts. Several dozen species of trees and shrubs grow in the park. Two trees have been listed as Polish Natural Monument: * an English oak with a trunk circumference of (2011).

The graveyard houses 1169 inhabitants of Bydgoszcz, murdered during the Nazi occupation of the city. It includes the victimes executed at the Old Market square, at the Valley of Death and in the surrounding forests. The corpses have been exhumed from 1946 to 1948 and solemnly buried there. Graveyard gate entrance In the centre of the necropolis stands an urn containing the ashes of 100 inhabitants of Bydgoszcz shot in the village of Otorowo in October 1939. One can find as well the symbolic graves of many local personages murdered by the Nazis: * Leon Barciszewski and Bernard ≈öliwi≈Ñski, presidents of Bydgoszcz during the interwar period; * Konrad Fiedler, a journalist and councilor; * Marian Maczuga, a merchant; * Mieczys≈Çaw Nawrowski, vice-president of Bydgoszcz; * J√≥zef Schulz, priest of the parish cathedral. Nearby have been placed a commemorative plaque and an urn with the ashes of Bydgoszcz residents murdered in concentration camps. There are also interred: * city councilors (Kazimierz Beyer, Jan G√≥ralewski and eng. Tadeusz Janicki) shot on October 5, 1939; * several dozen teachers shot on November 1, 1939 in the Death Valley; * priests, freelancers, craftsmen and workers. In the northern part of the cemetery stands a cross with a field altar. In the north-west corner, a commemorative plaque on a pedestal (designed by Piotr Triebler) has been unveiled in 1949 in honor of the Jews of Bydgoszcz. Close to the gate entrance one can find a monument uncovered in 1985, to celebrate 50 soldiers and officers from the Bydgoszcz Battalion of National Defense () murdered in Boryszew on September 22, 1939, for their alleged participation in Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday (September 3, 1939). The gate is a donation from the craftsmen of Bydgoszcz in 1967: it is adorned with the Order of the Cross of Grunwald, Bydgoszcz coat of arms and two stylized crosses.

He is considered one of the pioneers of photography in Portugal. Most of his photographs from between 1849 and 1859 have been well-preserved. History Frederick Flower was born on 22 February 1815 in Leith, Scotland, where his father had been sent to work. At an early age his parents moved back to England, living in Hull. It was from there that he sailed to Porto in 1834, where he took up a position with the Port wine exporters, Smith Woodhouse & Company. He stayed at the home of the owner of the company, Robert Woodhouse, as was customary for young Englishmen moving to Portugal to work in the wine trade. Following the death of his father, he was joined in Portugal in 1836 by his mother, brother and two younger sisters. It is not known exactly when Flower took up photography or from where he obtained the necessary expertise. He was one of the first people in Portugal to use the salted paper and calotype processes developed by Henry Fox Talbot in England from the late 1830s. He may have learned of the calotype process from Joseph James Forrester, famous for mapping the Douro river, who took up amateur photography around 1853, although information was first made available in the Revista Liter√°ria published in Porto. Flower made most of his calotypes between 1853 and 1858. He was also the Portuguese pioneer of the use of strip photography. Flower is likely to have obtained his photographic supplies from British suppliers and received instructions along with those supplies. View of Porto taken by Flower in 1849 Flower prepared his own photographic emulsion and was known to sometimes touch up the negatives to create an artificial cloud effect. His photographs were usually taken in Porto and in Vila Nova de Gaia on the opposite bank of the Douro, where the port companies were based. However, he also travelled widely in northern Portugal. His photographs provide an important record of aspects of everyday life in Portugal at that time. Preservation and exhibition of photographs Flower briefly returned to England in 1874 for health reasons but he and his wife returned to Porto later, where he died on 18 July 1889. For more than a century, Flower's direct descendants ensured the conservation of his photographs before donating them to the National Photography Archive of the General-Directorate of Cultural Heritage of Portugal. In 1928, his grandson, Harold M. Flower, commissioned new prints obtained from the calotypes and toured the north of Portugal to try to identify the places photographed by his grandfather. The family had carefully preserved the photographs, also collecting historical memories about its author. Although the Flower family remained an Anglo-Portuguese family, they never transferred the photographs to England. Whenever a member of the family returned to England, he or she deposited the collection with another family member who remained in Portugal. The calotype negatives have mainly survived in good condition, but some of the prints have not. Because his photographs were retained by the family, Flower had been relatively unknown in Portugal, apart from through one or two magazine articles. This changed after the State acquired his photographs and an exhibition was held at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Lisbon in 1994. The total collection consists of 216 calotypes and 101 proofs on salted paper (together with later proofs). This allowed the photographs to be appraised not just for their historical record but also for their artistic style, as noted by Andr√© Rouill√© in the Exhibition Catalogue. An examination of the collection shows strong evidence of Flower's technical skills and mastery of photographic techniques as well as deliberate attempts to experiment.

It was also prohibited by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624 in 2005. Overview Legal scholars Daphne Barak-Erez and David Scharia have identified a difference in approach between European and United States laws criminalizing incitement to terrorism; the former tend to focus on the content of the speech and whether it supports terrorist violence, while the latter focuses on whether the speaker is linked to proscribed organizations. The European approach involves explicit limits on freedom of speech, while the United States approach is more indirect. Incitement is an inchoate offense and is punishable even if no causal connection with a terror attack is proven. Merely establishing terrorism as a potential result of the speech is sufficient. One major motivation for criminalizing incitement to terrorism is its potential usefulness as an upstream prevention for deadly terror attacks. Some experts even argue that incitement is a sine qua non for terrorist attacks. International law United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624, unanimously adopted in 2005, is the first international legal instrument which deals with incitement to terrorism. It was prompted by the 2005 London bombings. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1963 authorizes the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council to monitor the passage of laws criminalizing incitement to terrorism in member states. =European law= The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, also in 2005, which requires member countries to pass legislation to criminalize the \\"public provocation to commit a terrorist offence\\". This does not cover apologia for terrorism. Although the European Convention on Human Rights protects freedom of expression, incitement is not protected. In Zana v. Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Mehdi Zana's free speech rights were not violated when he was punished by Turkey for calling PKK, a proscribed terrorist organization, a \\"national liberation movement\\". In Leroy v. France, cartoonist Denis Leroy's conviction and fine for glorifying the September 11 attacks under French law was upheld by the ECHR. By country =France= Article 24 of the French Press Act of 1881 criminalizes the incitement and advocacy of terrorism, as well as apologia for terrorism. , the penalty was up to five years imprisonment and/or a fine up to 45,000 euros. =Israel= Barak-Erez and Scharia identify Israel as belonging to the European tradition, in part because of its legal system's origins in British law. The Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance, enacted in 1948, remains in force, and was for many years the primary provision criminalizing incitement to terrorism. This ordinance empowers the government to designate terrorist organizations and criminalizes being a member of or supporting such a group. Section 4 of the ordinance states that: In Jabareen v. State of Israel, the Supreme Court of Israel found that the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance applied only to designated terrorist organizations rather than the promotion of acts of violence more generally. Following this case, the Knesset replaced Section 4 with a new section, 144D2, which extends the prohibition to incitement of terrorist actions not connected to terrorist organizations. =Spain= Article 18.1 of the Spanish Penal Code criminalizes provocation to commit any criminal offense and by extension apologia for criminal offenses. Organic Law No. 7/2000 explicitly prohibits, with a penalty of one to two years' imprisonment: =United Kingdom= The Terrorism Act 2006 created the offense of encouragement to terrorism, which prohibits \\"a statement that is likely to be understood by some or all of the members of the public to whom it is published as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to them to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences.\\" Indirect encouragement statements include \\"every statement which glorifies the commission or preparation (whether in the past, in the future or generally) of such acts or offences\\".Terrorism Act 2006 However, they are only criminalized if the speaker intends to cause others to commit terrorist offenses. =United States= Because of the First Amendment, incitement to terrorism or other forms of crime and unlawful violence is constitutionally protected free speech, unless it can be proven that the speech is \\"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action\\" and \\"is likely to incite or produce such action\\". However, in 2010 Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, the Supreme Court ruled that \\"a criminal prohibition on advocacy carried out in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization is constitutionally permissible\\". This is because such statements constitute material support for terrorism. Some defendants, including Javed Iqbal, who helped the Hezbollah TV station Al- Manar to broadcast, have been convicted of providing material support for terrorism under United States law. Conflict with free speech Incitement to terrorism offenses are considered by some to be an unjustified infringement of free speech rights, and it is argued that general encouragement of terrorism may be a political statement rather than literal encouragement to commit terrorist offenses. However, some advocates of criminalization, such as Ya√´l Ronen, believe that it is possible and desirable to criminalize a definition of incitement to terrorism which does not excessively infringe freedom of speech.

She wrote that the series is \\"unabashedly feminist\\", and that it \\"does more than just affirm that transgender children exist and matter and are worthy of respect; the show argues for these children's rights.\\" Rebecca Onion, writing for Slate, said, \\"The new show is indeed adorable‚Äîthe multiracial group of suburban middle schoolers earnestly booking gigs from their perch in Claudia Kishi's colorful bedroom is just as plucky and kind as ever . . . The new show has gotten plaudits for its diverse cast and plotlines, but in many important ways, the whole idea is a pure fantasy: of suburban community, of gentle coming-of-age, of meaningful work that teaches responsibility and pays just enough for fancy new paintbrushes.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Lucy Mangan said, \\"What could have been a sugary nostalgia-fest or worse a reboot that indulged the apparently insatiable urge to sex up material from a more innocent time, regardless of the age and/or continued innocence of its audience, is in fact a funny, fresh reimagining. Building on Martin's solid, good-hearted tales, it maintains a contemporary feel without losing the old-fashioned charm at its heart.\\" Petrana Radulovic of Polygon said, \\"Like their book counterparts, all the girls in The Baby-Sitters Club are more in-depth than their one-word trope descriptor (tomboy, goody two- shoes, artsy kid, prep, hippie) implies, thanks in part to the skillful performances from the young actresses. As spunky, outspoken Kristy, Sophie Grace adds nuance to her bossy, bratty attitude, grounding what could be an over-the-top performance with some tender moments. Momona Tamada, of To All the Boys I've Loved Before fame, captures Claudia's quirkiness and energy, but not without pangs of isolation because she feels her family will never understand her.\\" Writing for the Hollywood Reporter, Robyn Bahr called the show \\"not only warm and effervescent, [but] downright among the best shows the streaming platform has produced to date.\\" Kelly Lawler, writing for USA Today, said the show was \\"optimistic but not deluded, youthful but not juvenile and sweet but not mawkish. Its quintet of young actresses (the original four sitters and one mid-season addition) are talented beyond their years, but the dialogue never makes them sound like 40-year-old Hollywood scriptwriters.\\" Hank Stuever, writing for The Washington Post, noted \\"the show's remarkably talented cast of young actresses, all of whom either never learned the kidz- show style of overacting ('schmacting,' we sometimes call it), or were never afflicted with it to begin with. They are wholly believable in the roles of these idealized youths, with especially good performances from Tamada and Baker.\\" Jenny Singer, writing for Glamour, called the show \\"both unbelievably wholesome and seriously entertaining. The girls buy a landline phone on Etsy, hit up local parents with targeted Instagram ads, and make comments like, 'Art shouldn't be only the province of the privileged!' Their comedy is funny, their trauma is real, their style choices (by costume designer Cynthia Ann Summers) slay.\\"  Notes   References  External links 2020 American television series debuts 2020s American comedy-drama television series American television shows based on children's books The Baby-Sitters Club English-language television shows English-language Netflix original programming Television series reboots Television shows based on American novels Television shows set in Connecticut ","title":"The Baby-Sitters Club (2020 TV series)"},{"id":"63967888","text":"right GURPS Fantasy Folk is a supplement published by Steve Jackson Games in 1990 for the GURPS role-playing system.

The tribe inhabited Yemen in the Jahiliyyah.  Traditional Arab genealogy  According to Ibn Hisham the members of the Banu 'Akk tribe are descendants of a man called Al- Dith ibn Adnan () or also known as 'Akk. Akk dwelt in Yemen because he took a wife amongst the Banu Ash'ar and lived with them. The Banu Ash'ar were descended from Nabat ibn Udad ibn Zayd ibn Yashjub ibn Arib ibn Zayd ibn Kahlan ibn Saba'. While regarding the Banu 'Akk lineage, there seems to be a dispute between scholars in determining their origins. For example, According to al-Sam'ani they are of Adnanite origin. On the other hand, Ibn Hazm writes that they were descendant from Qahtan, hence, Qahtanite Arabs. The mother of Madh'hij, who is the founder of the Madh'hij tribe, is said to be from 'Akk. The tribe of Banu Ghafiq from which the general Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi descended, is a branch of Banu 'Akk.  History  = Pre-Islamic period = The Arab tribes were known to go on a pilgrimage to the temples of the pagan deities of Arabia. Banu 'Akk tribesmen would travel from Yemen to Mecca to perform the pilgrimage to the deity Wadd. According to Kitab al-Asnam (The Book of Idols) of Ibn al-Kalbi, The Banu 'Akk had a unique chant and rituals to Wadd. The tribe would bring two young African slaves of theirs in front of the tribesmen, and the slaves proceed to shout: \\"We are the crows of 'Akk!\\" The tribesmen reply and shout: \\"'Akk to you submits, Your worshippers from Yemen. May we once more make this pilgrimage!\\" = Islamic period = The Banu 'Akk participated in many battles and conflicts. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Amr ibn al-'As entered Egypt with an army that included approximately 3,000 to 4,000 men from the tribe of Banu 'Akk. In 817 AD, the Banu 'Akk participated in a revolt alongside Banu Ash'ar against Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun's governor of Yemen  See also  * Wadd * Tribes of Arabia * Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia  References  Tribes of Arabia ","title":"Banu 'Akk"},{"id":"63967950","text":"David Anthony Kenny (born October 11, 1946) is an American social psychologist and Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut.

In two editions of Lives of the Artists, Vasari described Cupid and Psyche and Bacchus and Venus, two mythological oil paintings produced for Francis I of France by Fiorentino. In the first edition (1550) he recorded that the paintings were produced soon after the painter's arrival in France in 1530 and before Primaticcio's arrival two years later. They were both displayed at the end of the Francis I Gallery at Fontainebleau Palace. Almost nothing is known of the painting Vasari called Cupid and Psyche, though it may relate to a Cupid and Venus for which a preparatory drawing survives in the Louvre. B√©guin cautiously identified the Luxembourg work as the Bacchus and Venus mentioned by Vasari. Its poor-to-moderate condition means that it cannot be directly attributed to Fiorentino nor to any of his Fontainebleau collaborators, meaning that the theory that it is an autograph work by Fiorentino has been taken up and developed.

The union was founded in 1881 at a conference in Paris. Initially, it struggled, but under the leadership of Auguste Keufer, it became centralised and espoused reformist social democracy. In 1895, it was one of the main founding affiliates of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). By 1920, the union claimed 20,000 members. After World War II, the union had many closed shop agreements, and few members left to join the Workers' Force-affiliated Book Federation. By 1964, the union claimed 60,000 members. In 1967, it was admitted to the International Graphical Federation (IGF), itself linked to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). This was a unique situation, as the CGT was aligned with the French Communist Party, and its other affiliates were linked with the World Federation of Trade Unions, and it led to the IGF being suspended from the ICFTU. In 1982, the union merged with the National Federation of Paper and Cardboard, to form the Federation of the Book-Paper-Cardboard Industry.

There are two forms of prescription: (1) positive prescription, which creates certain real rights, and (2) negative prescription, which extinguishes both personal and real rights. Prescription is different from limitation, which prevents the raising of court proceedings or litigation in relation to civil law matters in Scottish courts, primarily affecting personal injury claims arising from delict as these are exempt from prescription.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1984 s.2; Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.17.Report on Prescription (2017, SLC Report No 247), page 1. Available: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/reports/2010-present/. The terms prescription and limitation are used in other jurisdictions to describe similar rules, mainly due to shared Roman law and Civil law heritage. The law of prescription, although a long-standing feature of Scots property law, has been the subject of modern reform, primarily following on from reports on the law by the Scottish Law Commission (SLC). The SLC's main reports on prescription, with some of the recommendations of these reports adopted and introduced into statute, are: * Reform of the Law Relating to Prescription and Limitation of Actions (1970, SLC Report No 15) * Prescription and Limitation of Actions (Latent Damage and Other Related Issues) (1989, SLC Report No 122) * Personal Injury Actions: Limitation and Prescribed Claims (2007, SLC Report 207) * Prescription (2017, SLC Report No 247) Despite these reforms, the primary source of law regulating prescription is still the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973. 1973 Act was last subject to major reform under the Prescription (Scotland) Act 2018, which followed on from the SLC's 2017 Report.  Positive Prescription  Positive prescription allows the creation of real rights through the passage of time. It was first introduced into Scots law by the Prescription Acts of 1469 & 1474\\\\. However, it came into greater usage following the Prescription Act 1617, an Act of the Parliament of Scotland: > \\"ACT XII Regarding prescription of heritable rights Our sovereign lord, > considering the great prejudice which his majesty's lieges sustain in their > lands and heritages, not only by the abstracting, corrupting and concealing > of their true evidents in their minority and less age and by the omission > thereof, by the injury of time, through war, plague, fire or such occasions, > but also by the counterfeiting and forging of false evidents and writs and > concealing of the same to such a time that all means of improving thereof is > taken away, whereby his majesty's lieges are constituted in a great > uncertainty of their heritable rights and diverse pleas and actions are > moved against them after expiring of 30 or 40 years, which nevertheless by > the civil law and by the laws of all nations are declared void and > ineffectual; and his majesty, according to his fatherly care which his > majesty has to ease and remove the grievances of his subjects, being willing > to cut off all occasions of pleas and to put them in certainty of their > heritage in all time coming, therefore his majesty, with advice and consent > of the estates of parliament, by the tenor of this present act, statutes, > finds and declares that whatsoever his majesty's lieges, their predecessors > and authors have possessed heretofore, or shall happen to possess in time > coming by themselves, their tenants and others having their rights, their > lands, baronies, annualrents and other heritage by virtue of their heritable > infeftments made to them by his majesty, or others their superiors and > authors for the space of 40 years, continuously and together following and > ensuing the date of their said infeftments, and that peaceably without any > lawful interruption made to them therein during the said space of 40 years, > that such persons, their heirs and successors shall never be troubled, > pursued nor deprived in the heritable right and property of their said lands > and heritages foresaid by his majesty or others their superiors and authors, > their heirs and successors, nor by any other person pretending right to the > same by virtue of prior infeftments, public or private...\\" While the wording of the Act indicates that positive prescription was introduced to serve as a method of rectifying situations where the lieges (ie: the King of Scot's subjects) had lost important documents proving their ownership of held property, commentators such as Wightman argue that the introduction of positive prescription was actually a \\"means to legitimise the appropriation of land which had never been granted to the owner in the first place.\\" and the 1617 Act allowed holders of land to become owner through the passage of 40 years possession. This primarily affected lands owned by the Church of Scotland and its officials, following the Reformation in Scotland. Today, the usage of positive prescription is strictly limited in application to the following circumstances under the 1973 Act: = Positive Prescription of Right of Ownership = The real right of ownership in Scots law can be created as an original mode of acquisition of corporeal heritable property (ie: it is not derivative acquisition, where ownership is acquired from another upon a voluntary or involuntary transfer). Positive prescription of ownership arises where land has been possessed openly, peaceably and without any judicial interruption for ten years and possession followed the registration/recording of a ex facie valid deed in the Land Register/General Register of Sasines.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.1 The registration process that commences the running of the positive prescriptive period is known as a prescriptive claim under the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012. = Positive Prescription of Servitudes = Servitudes, similar to easements in other jurisdictions, are capable of creation by positive prescription.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.3 The requirements are: * The rights under the prescriptive positive servitude has been exercised openly, peaceably and without judicial interruption for a period of twenty years.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.3(1(a)). * The exercise of the rights are founded upon an a non domino deed which terms are sufficient to create a servitude of the nature of the prescriptive servitude.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.3(1(b)). After the 20 year prescriptive period concludes, the existence of the servitude is beyond legal challenge.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.3(3). However, while the servitude may validly exist under Scots law,still may not be appear on the Land Register, as acquisition by prescription is one of the main exemptions from the requirements of registration of real rights. = Positive Prescription of Public Rights of Way = Public rights of way are capable of creation by prescription under the 1973 Act. The requirements are: * The right of way has been exercised openly, peaceably and without judicial interruption for a period of twenty years.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.3(2). After the 20 year prescriptive period concludes, the existence of the public right of way is beyond legal challenge.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.3(3). Similarly to prescriptive servitudes, a public right of way may not be denoted in the Land Register but still validly exist. ScotWays, the Scottish Rights of Way Access Society, maintains a public register of rights of way, the National Catalogue of Rights of Way, in order to raise awareness of the existence of public rights of way in Scotland.  Negative Prescription  Negative prescription allows for the extinction of obligations and rights (both real and personal). This is because Scots law adopts the Roman law principle that vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt (lit: the law assists those that are vigilant with their rights, and not those that sleep on them). The Scottish Law Commission discuss the important aspects of negative prescription: > \\"Negative prescription plays an essential part in balancing individual > interests on the one hand and serving the public interest on the other. > Justice between the parties to litigation means that after a certain lapse > of time it is actually fairer to deprive a pursuer of a right than to allow > it to trouble a defender. That is connected with concerns about stale or > missing evidence and the difficulties facing a court in trying to administer > justice in those circumstances. There is another dimension too: there is > more to prescription than justice between the parties to a particular case. > There is a wider public interest in having litigation initiated promptly if > it is to be initiated at all. That is conducive to legal certainty. Even if > in an individual case prescription may seem to involve hardship, as long as > the law of prescription strikes a fair balance overall, it serves the wider > interests of fairness, justice and certainty. It is for the legislature to > decide what the appropriate time-limits should be, and what should be the > exceptions or qualifications to them. A well moderated law of prescription > will serve the public interest by promoting legal certainty and the > efficient use of resources. In this way it can make a valuable contribution > to a strong sustainable economy\\"Prescription (2017, SLC Report No 247), page > 1. = Short Negative, or quinquennial, Prescription = Short prescription occurs where rights and obligations have a prescriptive period of 5 years.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.6 The 1973 Act provides that monetary obligations (ie: the legal obligation to pay a sum of money to another under contract, delict or unjustified enrichment) are subject to a 5 year-prescriptive period.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.6; Schedule 1. This includes:Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 Schedule 1. * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of interest; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of an instalment of an annuity; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of by of ground annual or other periodical payment under a contract of ground annual; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of rent or other periodical payment under a lease; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of a periodical payment in respect of the occupancy or use of land; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of a periodical payment under a land obligation; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of redress of unjustified enrichment, including without prejudice to that generality any obligation of restitution, repetition or recompense; * any obligation to pay a sum of money arising from an individual acting as negotiorurn gestio, a form of agency in Scots law. * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of liability (whether arising from any enactment or from any rule of law) to make reparation ; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due under a bill of exchange or a promissory note; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of an obligation to account, other than accounting for trust funds ; * any obligation to pay a sum of money due in respect of any obligation arising from, or by reason of any breach of, a contract or promise, not being any obligation already falling within the five-year period. Therefore, if any of the above obligations fail to be enforced within 5 years of its existence, the obligation prescribes and it becomes unenforceable.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1973 s.6 However, the prescriptive period 'clock' does not take into account any period in which the debtor of the obligation (ie: the person obliged to make payment) has acted fraudulently, or his words or conduct induces the creditor to make an error, to prevent enforcement.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.6(4). However, while most monetary obligations are covered by the five year prescriptive period, the following obligations are specifically exempt from the 5-year prescriptive period:Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 Schedule 1, para 2. * any obligation arising from a decree of court, an arbitration award or an order of a tribunal or authority exercising jurisdiction under any enactment; * any obligation arising from the issue of a bank note; * any obligation constituted or evidenced by a probative writ, not being a cautionary obligation nor being an obligation relating to interest. * to any obligation under a contract of partnership or of agency, not being an obligation remaining, or becoming, prestable on or after the termination of the relationship between the parties under the contract; * except for obligation involving negotorium gestio, any obligation relating to land (including an obligation to recognise a servitude); * to any obligation arising out of succession law and inheritance rights under the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964. * any obligation to make reparation in respect of personal injuries or in respect of the death of any person as a result of such injuries = Long Negative Prescription = Any obligation, including those covered or exempted by short-prescription, will prescribe after 20 years, by the passage of the long prescriptive period.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.7 This includes real rights which have not been exercised for over 20 years bar those immprescriptible.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.8. The passage of 20 years is considered the long-stop date for all obligations and real rights bar those specified as imprescriptible or relating to personal injury.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 s.7(2); Schedule 3.Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1984 = Imprescriptible Rights = Certain rights and obligations do not prescribe, either by short or long negative prescription:Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 Schedule 3. * the real right of ownership of corporeal heritable property (land). As this only relates to land, loss of ownership of moveable property is still possible. However, while an owner of land's right cannot be extinguished by negative prescription, it can still be extinguished by operation of positive prescription by a possessor (see above). * the real right of lease, this is only created by leases registered in the Land Register under the Registration of Leases (Scotland) Act 1857. * any right exercisable as res merae facultatis. Despite being a long used phrase in Scots law, the definition of rights res merea facultatis (in Latin, lit: 'through a glass darkly') is uncertain.Paisley, R. R. M. (2007). Right to make Roads and res merae facultatis. Edinburgh Law Review, 11(1), 95-99. https://doi.org/10.3366/elr.2007.11.1.95 It is considered that these are property rights associated with ownership held over corporeal heritable property, either held in the owner's land itself or another neighbouring property, which cannot prescribe. The exact species of rights falling as res merae facultatits is subject to academic debate and conflicting decisions by the Scottish courts.For a comprehensive discussion on res merae facultatis, see Sheriff CUSINE, Res Merae Facultatis: Through a Glass Darkly' In: 'Essays in Conveyancing and Property Law: In Honour of Professor Robert Rennie' [online]. Cambridge: Open Book Publishers, 2015 (generated 16 may 2020). Available on the Internet: <http://books.openedition.org/obp/2089>. * any right to recover property extra commercium. These are described by Lord Polwarth, the then Minister of State for Scotland, as: > \\" property extra commercium comprises various categories of things which > cannot be reduced into private ownership, either because of their nature, or > because of some relevant rule of law. Particular examples are court records > or other public documents which are held by whoever may have custody of them > for the benefit of the community at large and not for the individual > possessor. Where such articles are found in the possession of someone other > than the proper custodian, it has been held that the latter's right to > recover them does not prescribe: the right of recovery persists, however > long may be the period of time during which they have been outside the legal > custodian's control.\\" * Obligation of a trustee to produce accounts of the trustee's dealings with any property of the trust; * Obligations of a trustee to make reparation or restitution in respect of any fraudulent breach of trust; * Obligation to provide property to any person entitled to it under a trust, or the proceeds of any such property, in the possession of the trustee, or the value of any such property previously taken the trustee and appropriated to his own use ; * any obligation of a third party to make furthcoming to any person entitled to any trust property received by the third party otherwise than in good faith and in his possession ; * any right to recover stolen property from the person by whom it was stolen or from any person privy to the stealing thereof; * any right to an estate as heir to an ancestor who died before the commencement of the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964; *any right to take any steps necessary for making up or completing title to any interest in land.

Personal diving equipment shared by more than one user requires disinfection before use. Shared use is common for expensive commercial diving equipment, and for rental recreational equipment, and some items such as demand valves, masks, helmets and snorkels which are worn over the face or held in the mouth are possible vectors for infection by a variety of pathogens. Diving suits are also likely to be contaminated, but less likely to transmit infection directly. The maintenance of personal diving equipment includes cleaning and inspection after use, repair or servicing when necessary or scheduled, and appropriate storage. A large part of this is washing off salt water to prevent it from drying on the equipment and leaving corrosive brine or abrasive salt deposits, which can cause accelerated deterioration of some materials and jamming of moving parts. The ultraviolet component of sunlight can also damage non- metallic components and equipment, and ozone produced by electrical equipment is known to adversely affect some materials, such as the latex seals on dry suits. Storage at high temperatures can also reduce the useful life of some materials. Most diving equipment will last better if stored in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. When disinfecting diving equipment it is necessary to consider the effectiveness of the disinfectant on the expected or targeted pathogens, and the possible adverse effects on the equipment. Some highly effective methods for disinfection can damage the equipment, or cause accelerated degradation of components due to incompatibility with materials. Ultraviolet light - including sunshine, ozone and high temperatures are among these. Chlorinated water in swimming pools will also degrade some materials, but rinsing in fresh water after use will minimise the effect. Effective cleaning and sanitisation procedures are expected of service providers renting diving equipment to the public, and by commercial diving contractors in terms of occupational health and safety legislation, and codes of practice. Pathogens likely to be found on personal diving equipment *Pathogens from a contaminated environment. *Pathogens transmitted in saliva, sputum, nasal mucus and vomit are possible contaminants of masks, demand valves, snorkels, helmets and buoyancy compensator inflation heads and interiors. These potentially include a wide range of viruses and bacteria, including rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. *Pathogens transmitted by contact with skin infections are possible contaminants of diving suits and diving suit accessories. *Pathogens found in bodily discharges including urine and feces are possible contaminants of diving suits. Pathogens which are known to contaminate bodies of water include: *Bacteria, such as: ** ** ** ** ** *Protozoans, such as: ** ** ** ** ** *Viruses Pathogens which may be transmitted between sequential users of diving equipment: *Bacteria: *Viruses: **  General cleaning  Cleaning to remove salt water, sand, mud, and other relatively harmless environmental contaminants is intended to reduce degradation to the equipment and improve comfort during the next use. In most cases soaking or rinsing in fresh water is sufficient, but detergents and occasionally scrubbing before rinsing can speed up the process. This basic cleaning may remove some pathogens and chemical contaminants, but it is not reliable for this purpose. This level of cleaning has traditionally been considered sufficient for equipment only used by one person in environments considered to be free of chemical and microbial health hazards. = Cleaning after use = Cleaning after use is generally intended to remove contaminants which may degrade the equipment, and which may be harmful to persons coming into normal handling contact with the equipment. It may be combined with disinfection suitable to prepare the equipment for use by another person, but the two aspects are not necessarily managed identically or together. = Disinfection before use = Disinfection of equipment before use, or between users, is intended to remove biological contamination that would affect the next diver to use it. This is generally an issue when the equipment is not contaminated by substances or microorganisms which are harmful to the equipment, but could infect and cause illness in the next user, or in the special case of potable water diving, could contaminate the drinking water supply. If there is not sufficient time and facilities to adequately disinfect between users, equipment which could infect the user should not be shared. Targeted disinfection During periods of increased risk relating to a specific pathogen during an epidemic, or after diving in an area known as a high risk for a specific pathogen, disinfection procedures will target that pathogen. During an epidemic, the first line of defence is for symptomatic people and people who have tested positive for the infection to refrain from diving, however in the early stages of some diseases it will not be apparent that the person is infectious, so it is prudent to take reasonably practicable preventative measures when the risk is assessed as significant. =Disinfection to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection= The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 disease is considered easier to kill than the closely related SARS-CoV-1, so in the absence of specific test results for SARS-CoV-2, methods for disinfection of SARS-CoV-1 are assumed to be effective. According to the World Health Organization, SARS-CoV-1 loses infectivity after 15 minutes at , Another study showed that SARS-CoV-1 remains stable between and , and loses infectivity after 30 minutes at . (Duan et al 2003 in DANSA 2020) Divers Alert Network has estimated that a breathing air compressor in a environment, would have an inter-stage temperature inside the cylinder of about . The calculation does not account for anything outside of nominal conditions, but it indicates the instantaneous temperature at the moment of peak pressure. In reality the compressed air is cooled between stages, and the compressor itself is fairly hot, so direct measurement would be relatively simple, but this does not take into account time of exposure to temperature. The actual gas temperature at the outlet from each stage was reported to be around This is considered to be hot enough to kill SARS-CoV-2, so it is considered unlikely that the virus would survive passing through a compressor. Infected droplets exhaled by a person can be as small as 0.5 micron, so the compressor particle filter systems would not reliably remove them. There are many disinfectants that are assumed to be effective on SARS-CoV-2 based on their effectiveness on similar viruses which are considered more resistant to deactivation. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publish a list of disinfectant products which meet the EPA's criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2 in \\"List N: Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2\\" in the absence of specific testing on SARS-CoV-2. Divers Alert Network have recommended following Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advice on using a solution of household bleach diluted 4:100 in water with a contact time of 1 minute followed by a thorough rinse in water to remove residual disinfectant. As of April 24 2020, Steramine, a quaternary ammonium compound popular for disinfecting diving equipment, did not appear on the EPA's \\"List N\\" and is therefore not endorsed for disinfecting SARS-CoV-2. However, many other products using quaternary ammonium compounds are on List N. Sodium hypochlorite bleach is a strong oxidant which has been tested in different concentrations, and is proven to be effective against viruses by damaging the viral genome. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a 1:100 dilution of 5% sodium hypochlorite bleach solution for general disinfection, which yields 0.05% or 50 ppm of the active ingredient which requires a soaking time of 30 minutes or at least 10 minutes wet time if sprayed onto a nonporous surface. Specific studies on SARS-CoV-2 found that a sodium hypochlorite bleach concentration of 0.1% (1,000 ppm) was necessary to adequately reduce infectivity when sprayed onto a non-porous surface, and that it would inactivate the virus within 1 minute. A study on SARS-CoV-1 showed that a 1:100 dilution (0.05%) inactivated the virus after an immersion of 5 minutes. = Pathogens associated with specific environments = Commercial diving operations are often required for maintenance and repair work in water known to have high counts of E. coli and other pathogens. Diving equipment used in these environments should preferably isolate the diver completely from the environment, and the diver and equipment should be decontaminated by competent persons after leaving the water and before removing the encapsulating equipment from the diver.

The film explores the culture surrounding youth basketball in Prince George's County, Maryland, an area that has produced a significant number of talented basketball players, including Durant. Durant and Prince George's County native Victor Oladipo served as executive producers, and local rapper Jason Mills narrated the film. The film was distributed by Showtime Networks and debuted May 15, 2020 on the network's live and digital services.  Synopsis  Due to its role in producing basketball players that have gone on to star in the NBA, WNBA, and college level, basketball players that grew up in \\"PG County\\" attest that there is something \\"in the water\\" there that leads to the production of talented basketball players. The film traces basketball's prominence in the nation's capital back to Edwin Bancroft Henderson, dubbed \\"the father of black basketball,\\" who thought that black youth would benefit from athletic skills. After racial unrest following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., middle-class black families left Washington for suburban Prince George's County, which boasted hundreds of basketball courts at its parks. After the crack epidemic of the 1980s, youth basketball moved indoors to the county's recreation centers, which served as safe places for youth to play basketball and develop friendships. The film also chronicles the career of Morgan Wootten, longtime coach of basketball powerhouse DeMatha Catholic High School, the effects of Len Bias' death on the Prince George's community, the role of Amateur Athletic Union teams in garnering player prestige, the influence of go-go music on players, and the role of AAU coach Curtis Malone in the lives of players before his arrest on federal drug charges in 2014. Durant's philanthropic ventures in the county are also chronicled. The film is dedicated to the memory of Bias, Wootten, and Durant's close friends Cliff Dixon, who died in an Atlanta shooting in 2019, and Jamar \\"Silent\\" Board, a DC playground basketball star who died suspiciously in 2013. Notable interviewees include Durant, Oladipo, Michael Beasley, Jerai and Jerami Grant, Morgan Wootten, Marissa Coleman, James Brown, Jeff Green, Walt Williams, Steve Francis, Brenda Frese, Adrian Dantley, Jarrett Jack, Kris Jenkins, Nate Britt, John Thompson, Michael Sweetney, Quinn Cook, Markelle Fultz, Lamman Rucker, DerMarr Johnson, and Nolan Smith.  Release  Showtime released the film on its digital streaming service on May 15, 2020 ahead of its planned airing on its TV channel that same night.  Reception  Brady Langmann of Esquire gave the film a positive review, comparing it favorably to _The Last Dance_ , a miniseries about Michael Jordan.

His son Nigamshanker, who is studying in a Sanskirt pathshala, suddenly has an attack of smallpox and loses his eyesight. He reconciles himself to his fate, goes to the pathshala and attempts to learn by hearing. A great Sanskrit scholar from Varanasi visits the pathshala; seeing Nigamshanker's desire for knowledge, he takes him to Varanasi. Nigamshanker studies there for 12 years, gaining proficiency in all branches of knowledge. When he returns, his father is on his deathbed. His father had married a girl of his son's age after his mother's death. Nigamshanker does not mourn his father's death. However, he treats his stepmother so well that she persuades her niece Bhagirathi to marry him. Their married life is very happy. Bhagirathi gives birth to a son, Tilak, who is a bright boy. When he is 10 years old, he finds that he cannot read what has been written on the blackboard. When a doctor is consulted, he advises him to give up his studies, but Tilak, encouraged by his father, ignores the advice and pursues his studies. Furthermore, he even learns to play the sitar from Abhijit, his neighbor's son. Abhijit's sister Satya is a naughty girl who continuously teases Tilak about his weak eyesight. Once, when Tilak is attending a sitar concert, Satya abducts him. During a heavy downpour that lasts for several days, the river flowing through the city is flooding. Nigam, Bhagirathi and Tilak have to stand on the staircase for three days. In the flood, Nigam's books and rare manuscripts are destroyed. Nigam is reconciled to the disaster, but Tilak vows to rebuild the library. Satya is very worried about Tilak and tries to control him when he is impulsive. Tilak passes the B.A. examination with a first-class degree and, at the insistence of Gordhandas (the chairman of the governing body), is offered a job as librarian which he readily accepts. Gordhandas's daughter Iksha, who has sisterly feelings for Tilak, wants Tilak to complete his studies. Tilak's father Nigam is the chief priest at the sacrificial ceremony in the adjoining city, where he dies due to a snakebite. One day, Satya comes to the library and asks to marry Tilak. Tilak declines, stating that their children are likely to be blind, given that his grandfather had become blind some years prior to his death, his father's eyesight had deteriorated by the age of 16 and his eyesight is constantly getting worse. Satya promises to follow in the footsteps of Tilak's mother. Even then Tilak does not agree, but she says, \\"I won't accept defeat, I will have my way\\". She is forced to agree to her betrothal to Ajay. However, on the night before her wedding, she goes to Tilak wearing her wedding dress and asks to be implanted with the symbol of Tilak's cultural heritage. They have sex that night, which results in her conception. Satya's husband Ajay is a man of vices and perversions. Satya writes letters to Tilak, informing him about Ajay's behaviour and his insistence on her co- operating with him in his unlawful and criminal activities. In her last letter she tells him that her son has been born, and that she is happy because the son looks just like Tilak. Tilak does not reply, worrying that his letters might be intercepted and Ajay might kill her. Tilak takes his mother on a pilgrimage, leading to a clash between his mother's traditional attitude and Tilak's modernist, rationalist attitude. His mother chides him for not accepting Satya's offer of marriage, and depriving her of a grandson. Tilak, who keeps in mind the events of the night before Satya's marriage and Satya's letter informing him about the birth of a son, uses harsh words in order to hide the fact. Terribly hurt, Bhagirathi goes to the river to drown herself and Tilak has to reveal the secret in order to save his mother's life. After some days, Bhagirathi has a heart attack and dies with Satya's name on her lips. Tilak passes his M.A. examination in the first class and enrolls for a Ph.D. to research tribes. For this purpose he travels widely in tribal areas and reads a lot, causing his eyes to become damaged by the strain. He goes to Bombay to consult an eye specialist, who operates upon his eyes, but his eyesight is not restored. While leaving the clinic, Tilak accidentally sees Satya who has come for her son's eye check-up. Satya, who has now been divorced, takes Tilak to her house. They decide to stay together like a married couple, and go to Tilak's city. There, the people accept them as married, and the child as their son. Not only that, Satya is allowed to perform the traditional temple ritual which is performed by the most pious person. Theme The theme of Asuryalok is a struggle for enlightenment against physical as well as social hurdles. Reception The novel received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1988. The award citation states that \\"meaningful dialogues, lively characterisation and poetic description are the outstanding features of the novel. It is one of the most interesting and significant novels in the traditions of the novel of ideas.\\" The critic Chandrakant Mehta wrote: \\"the novel is a family saga in which social metamorphoses in a period of 60 years are vividly delineated. The narration, characterisation, style and expression all place the novel on a high pedestal. Though there is a tragic strain throughout the story, the main characters successfully fight their destiny, and that is the distinctive quality of the novel\\".

Vietnam War resisters in Canada included American draft evaders and military deserters who found refuge from prosecution in Canada. American war resisters who sought refuge in Canada during the Vietnam War would ignite controversy among those seeking to immigrate to Canada. According to scholar Valerie Knowles, draft evaders were typically college-educated and middle class who could no longer defer induction into the Selective Service System. Deserters were usually lower-income and working class who had been inducted into the armed services right after high school or had later volunteered, hoping to obtain a skill and broaden their limited horizons. Many continued to remain in Canada for their lives, and formed a small community of American war resisters in Canada.  History  = Immigration and politics = Starting in 1965, Canada became the main haven for Vietnam War resisters. Because war resisters they were not formally classified as refugees but were admitted as immigrants, there is no official estimate of how many draft evaders and deserters were admitted to Canada during the Vietnam War. One estimate puts their number between 30,000 and 40,000. American draft evaders were at first assisted by the Student Union for Peace Action, a campus-based Canadian anti-war group with connections to Students for a Democratic Society.Clausen, Oliver (May 21, 1967). \\"Boys Without a Country\\".

The Canadian government initially refused to admit deserters who could not prove that they had been discharged from American military service, this would change in 1968. On May 22, 1969, Ottawa announced that immigration officials would not and could not ask about immigration applicants' military status if they showed up at the border seeking permanent residence in Canada. While Canada openly accepted draft evaders and later deserters the United States never seriously contested Canada's actions, while Sweden's acceptance was heavily criticized. The issue of accepting American exiles became a local political debate in Canada that focused on Canada's sovereignty in its immigration law. The United States did not become involved because American politicians viewed Canada as geographically close ally not worth disturbing. Emigration from the United States continued to be unusually high while the United States was involved in the Vietnam War and maintained compulsory military service. In 1971 and 1972 Canada received more immigrants from the United States than from any other country. = Amnesty and repatriations = In September 1974, President Gerald R. Ford created an amnesty program for draft evaders that required them to work in alternative service occupations for periods of six to 24 months.Author unspecified (14 September 1974). \\" Flexible Amnesty Plan Is Reported Set by Ford\\". The New York Times, p. 9\\\\. Retrieved 28 July 2018. In 1977, one day after his inauguration, President Jimmy Carter fulfilled a campaign promise and offered pardons to any draft evader that requested one. It created controversy, with those on the right complaining of giving amnesty to criminals and those on the left complaining that requesting a pardon required the admission of a crime. According to sociologist John Hagan, after the 1977 amnesty about half of draft evaders in Canada remained while the others returned to the United States.Hagan, John (2001), pp. 3 and 241‚Äì42. Those who choose to return were notably lower class who had trouble finding work in Canada, a minority of leftist radicals who had demanded amnesty, or ethnic minorities who had trouble assimilating to Canadian culture. Despite not being granted amnesty, about 4 out of 5 deserters would eventually return to the United States. = Assimilation = Those that continued to live in Canada would form a visible community of Americans in Canada. The notably young and educated population that remained expanded Canada's arts and academic sectors, and helped promote leftist politics in Canada.These points have been made in a series of academic journal articles by Canadian social historian David Churchill: * Churchill, David S.

People  Interview with Mike Tulley, an American Vietnam War deserter who emigrated to Canada. (For interview, click on gray arrow at lower left of photo.) = Deserters = An estimated one thousand deserters fled to Canada to avoid more service in the Vietnam War. The United States government have not pardoned them and they may still face pro forma arrest if they return to the United States, as the case of Allen Abney demonstrated in March 2006., CBC News = Draft evaders = Estimates vary greatly as to how many Americans immigrated to Canada for the specific reason of evading conscription, as opposed to desertion, or other reasons. Canadian immigration statistics show that 20,000 to 30,000 draft-eligible American men came to Canada as immigrants during the Vietnam era. The BBC stated that \\"as many as 60,000 young American men dodged the draft.\\" Estimates of the total number of American citizens who moved to Canada due to their opposition to the war range from 50,000 to 125,000draft dodgers memorial to be built in B.C., CBC News, 09/08/2004 This exodus was \\"the largest politically motivated migration from the United States since the United Empire Loyalists moved north to oppose the American Revolution.\\"\\"On Strawberry Hill\\" by Chris Turner in The Walrus, September 2007. These young men were often well educated, and alienated from American society, showing a knowledge and distaste for American social problems at the time. Most felt the Vietnam War was immoral, and felt supported by the era's counterculture and protests to make the decision to flee to Canada. Despite a general distaste for the war, only a minority were active political radicals. Most made the decision to immigrate to Canada not because of a major opposition to the morality of the war, but in fear of a removal of personal independence brought by conscription. Many were middle class and needed little assistance assimilating in Canada. Draft evaders of a lower class background were more likely to come to Canada only as a last resort. American draft evaders tended to balance the \\"brain drain\\" that Canada had experienced. While some draft evaders returned to the United States after a pardon was declared in 1977 during the administration of Jimmy Carter, roughly half of them stayed in Canada.Hagan, John (2001), cited above, pp. 167 and 242.

His research at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital in the 1950s helped launch the fields of collagen research. In 1969, Gross was promoted to Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and named Biologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital. In the preceding decades, scientists from around the world traveled to his Developmental Biology Laboratory in the Department of Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital to study his work on collagen structure, wound healing, and limb regeneration. In 1987, Gross became Professor Emeritus of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. The following year, he became the first Paul Klemperer Award recipient at the New York Academy of Medicine. In 1995 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by The Wound Healing Society. Gross spent over 60 years on the faculty of Harvard and in the labs of Mass General Hospital. He died one month shy of his 97th birthday in Waban, Massachusetts, of natural causes.  Biography  Jerome Gross was born in New York City on February 25, 1917. In 1939, he graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While his scientific interests included astronomy and biology, he chose a career in medicine. He subsequently attended the New York University College of Medicine. After a year as an intern at Long Island College Hospital, he served two years in the Army Medical Corps. Gross believed that clues to diseases such as rheumatic fever would be found in the molecular structure and biology of connective tissue. He returned to M.I.T. to join the laboratory of Francis O. Schmitt as a Research Associate, where he began research on structural macromolecules utilizing chemical and electron microscopical methods. Despite many important observations on hyaluronic acid and elastin, he chose to focus on collagen. He was attracted to Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital by Walter Bauer, who thought that many of the secrets of rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatic fever could be uncovered by similar methods. Gross's pioneering findings that collagen molecules could be extracted from tissues using solutions of neutral salt or dilute acid and reconstituted into various structures opened up the field of collagen research. Gross then began to study collagen structure in animal models of human wound healing. In the late 1950s, he became interested in lathyrism and, with Charles Levene, made the critical observations that lathyrism resulted from abnormal aggregation and defective cross-linking of collagen molecules. Alongside his collaborators, Karl Piez and George Martin at the National Institute of Health, Gross discovered that collagen was composed of three polypeptide chains. These experiments opened up the field of collagen biology. In the early 1960s, Gross began searching for mechanisms whereby collagen fibers are degraded during tissue remodeling alongside Belgian postdoctoral fellow Charles Lapiere. Gross reasoned that collagenolytic enzymes, which previously had been identified only in bacteria, could be made only when and where they were needed. They looked for collagenase in the medium from tissue implants in culture. Together, they found the enzyme and characterized its mechanism of action and its unique cleavage site. With such colleagues as Martin Tanzer, Utaka Nagai, Andrew Kang, and others, Gross continued studies of mechanisms of collagenolysis, lathyrism, and wound healing. In 1969, Gross was promoted to Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and named Biologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Scientists from all over the world worked in Gross‚Äôs Developmental Biology Laboratory in the Department of Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Gross continued to make important observations on collagen structure, mechanisms of fibrillogenesis, the role of hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase in wound healing, embryogenesis and limb regeneration, the origin of corneal ulcers, and control of collagenase production.

Established at the end of 2010, it has become one of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan's largest breweries with sales that extend into Wisconsin and Michigan's Lower Peninsula..  History  David Manson and Andy Langlois founded Blackrocks Brewery in Marquette, Michigan, and opened its doors on December 28, 2010. Both were former pharmaceutical salesmen who were laid off in company downsizings during the late 2000s Great Recession.. The brewery takes its name from a set of rocks in Presque Isle Park from where people jump into Lake Superior. The brewery began life in a former Victorian- style residential home, with the first floor serving as an area for patrons and the basement serving as the home of a small one-barrel brewing system.. Manson and Langlois would sell their product until it ran out, which happened on the first day they opened and quickly became a frequent occurrence. As a result, they expanded to a three-barrel system and added a patio to expand the small customer serving area of the establishment. In 2013, Blackrocks expanded again into a purchased former Coca-Cola bottling plant.. They installed a twenty-barrel system in the building, which allowed the brewery to expand production to 4,500 barrels per year, and begin canning its beer. After a rapid growth in demand and a 25% increase in revenue in 2017, the company constructed a addition on the northern side of the former bottling plant in 2018, and installed solar panels on the building's roof in 2019. In May 2020, Blackrocks added two 120-barrel fermentors. = Production and distribution = In 2015 and 2016, Blackrocks expanded its production to 7,000 barrels per year and started selling its products across Michigan's Lower Peninsula and in the neighboring state of Wisconsin. , Blackrocks was the tenth-largest brewery in Michigan by total production and sales within the state. It was also the second largest in the Upper Peninsula, behind the Keweenaw Brewing Company. Blackrocks sold 7,500 barrels of beer in 2018, up from 6,595 in 2017, and 5,066 in 2016. = Mug club = Blackrocks' \\"mug club\\" gives patrons a custom large ceramic mug that are hung in the taproom and able to be used with every beer purchase, receiving a greater quantity of beer at the regular price. The initial membership was limited to 50 people at US$40 apiece, and the brewery found that it had to continually expand the program to meet demand. (See also WBUPs accompanying video with the same name and date, via YouTube.) By 2013, the number of mugs reached 1,100. The brewery eventually ran out of space to store additional mugs on-site, and as of 2015 the club was limited to about 1,400 patrons with rare chances to join.  Location  The customer-facing location of the Blackrocks Brewery is, , located in a former residential home at 424 N. Third Street in Marquette, Michigan. Described by the Star Tribune as looking like an \\"out-of-place ski chalet,\\" it contains two floors for customers and a large patio available year-round, with fire pits installed for use during the winter. The patio, which has proven to be controversial within the mostly residential neighborhood, was expanded in 2017. In winter, the establishment erects temporary igloo-shaped structures for customers to drink inside. A fence running along the edge of the taproom's property line incorporates used skis, some donated by patrons of the brewery. In February 2020, the brewery announced that it had purchased two structures on a taproom- adjacent property at 420 N. Third St. with the intention of expanding the area available to customers.  Recognition and beer  In 2013, Blackrocks was ranked by regional publication MLive as one of the best new breweries in the state of Michigan. Seven year later, their Honey Lav beer was named as \\"beer of the week\\" by the same outlet. , 51K IPA is Blackrocks' most popular beer; the Detroit Free Press has additionally stated that its Mykiss IPA \\"might be one of the best IPAs in the state\\" of Michigan. When the brewery started canning in 2013, they had three mainstay beers that were regularly canned: the 51K IPA, Grand Rabbits Cream Ale, and Coconut Brown Ale. , all three were still being canned alongside four others.

It is named for the detached Keweenaw Peninsula, which projects out to the north of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Established in 2004, it is the largest brewer in the Upper Peninsula, with can and bottle sales that extend into Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan's Lower Peninsula..  History  The Keweenaw Brewing Company opened in 2004. It was founded by Paul Boissevain and Richard Grey, who previously worked at the same oil company in Denver, Colorado, and lost their jobs around the same time.. Keweenaw was the second modern microbrewery in the Upper Peninsula, coming over three decades after the last brewery (Bosch) had closed in Houghton in 1973.. Located on Shelden Street in Houghton's downtown, Keweenaw quickly became financially successful despite not serving food. In the first year after opening, the brewery brewed 400 barrels of beer and took over a storefront next door.. In the following year, they brewed 1,100 barrels, and within three years of opening, they added a deck with parking options and were producing 2,000 barrels. In 2007, the brewpub expanded its production capabilities by purchasing a warehouse in South Range, Michigan, located just to the south of Houghton, and installing brewing and canning equipment within it.. They began canning their beer in the same year, putting Keweenaw in the vanguard of the canning of craft beer in the United States. In 2018, the company sold 11,349 barrels of beer within Michigan, making it the ninth-largest brewer in the state and the largest brewer in the Upper Peninsula. This total was up from 10,469 barrels in 2017, and 9,801 in 2016. , the brewery sold its products in Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan's Lower Peninsula.. By 2018, the brewing company inked a deal with Comerica Park, the stadium which hosts baseball's Detroit Tigers, to distribute their beer.  Location  , Keweenaw Brewing Company's brewpub's interior space measured and contained two bars and a fireplace. The exterior deck looks out over the Keweenaw Waterway, which separates Houghton from the city of Hancock and the rest of Copper Island. , all of the taproom's employees were students at nearby Michigan Technological University, and the brewery's existence was used as a selling point in attracting employees to the college..  Recognition and beer  In 2015, U.S. News & World Report named Keweenaw as one of the best breweries in the Midwestern United States. The most popular beer sold by the Keweenaw Brewing Company is Widow Maker Black Ale, whose name stems from a dangerous one-person drill once used in service of the region's extensive copper mining. They started canning the beer in 2009.

Background  James Mervyn Donahue, son of businessman Peter Donahue of the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad, and John D. Spreckels of the San Diego and Arizona Railway formed the Joggins Raft Company when they incorporated it with capital on September 21, 1889. The intent of the company was to build log rafts of eight to twelve million board feet. The size was dependent on the availability of timber at a particular time. These rafts were to be towed by tugs to San Francisco, where the mills will be located to process the logs into lumber. The cost to construction an 8,000,000 board foot raft was estimated at less than $15,000. A freight rate of approximately $2 per 1,000 board feet of timber was an enormous savings over the traditional shipping methods using railways.

Like the TV series, the player characters wake up in a village they are unable to leave, punished for infractions of multitudinous rules, and unable to find out where they are or why they are there. The book is divided into two sections. The setting is laid out in the first section, and includes a map of The Village, as well as village protocol such as dress and appropriate greetings. The second section provides hints to the gamemaster about how to develop suspense, how to answer players' questions, and how to pepper the adventure with weird encounters.

Contents GURPS Vikings is a supplement that details the Scandinavians of the Dark Ages and the early medieval period.https://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=4484 The book starts with an examination of six different styles of role-playing that can be used in a Viking campaign: * Thoughtful Historic (low fantasy, nonviolent role-playing) * Thoughtful Fantastic (authentic setting with supernatural touches) * Thoughtful Mythic (authentic setting, but with real Norse gods) * Action Historical (little fantasy, much fighting) * Action Fantastic (similar in style to most AD&D; or RuneQuest games) * Action Mythic (player characters actively participate in the conflicts of the Norse gods) Further chapters cover * the historical period, including Norse culture, history, economics, and floorplans of longhouses and forts. * new character classes * magic * religion * new monsters * designing scenarios Publication history In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '80s, game historian Shannon Appelcline noted that Steve Jackson Games decided in the early 1990s to stop publishing adventures, replacing them instead with genre sourcebooks. As Appelcline commented, \\"SJG was now putting out standalone GURPS books rather than the more complex tiered book lines. This included more historical subgenre books. Some, such as GURPS Camelot (1991) and GURPS China (1991), were clearly sub- subgenres, while others like GURPS Old West (1991) and GURPS Middle Ages I (1992) covered genres notably missing before this point.\\" One of these \\"sub- genre\\" books was GURPS Vikings, a 126-page softcover book designed by Graeme Davis, and edited by Steve Jackson, with interior art by Topper Helmers, Don Arburn, Carl Anderson, Denis Loubet, and Doug Shuler, and cover art by John Zeleznik. It was published by Steve Jackson Games in 1991. In 2002, Steve Jackson Games published a second edition of this book to be played with rules of the third edition of GURPS. The 128-page softcover book was again designed by Graeme Davis, with illustrations by Paul Daly, Shane L. Johnson, Garry McKee, Klaus Schwerinski, Carl Anderson, Topper Helmers, David McKay, and Michael S. Wilson, cartography by Mike Naylor, and cover art by Alex Fernandez. Reception In the May 1992 edition of Dragon (Issue #181), Rick Swan thought that this book \\"offers something for Vikings of every persuasion.\\" With regard to the history chapter, Swan was impressed by the author's ability to \\"pack an enormous amount of information into a relatively few pages, emphasizing many intriguing facets of culture and economics.\\" However, he found the chapter on new character classes \\"isn't particularly inspiring,\\" and he also noted that \\"magic is underplayed... a disappointing section.\\" He did like the new monsters, \\"a good mix of the ordinary and the unusual.\\" In conclusion, Swan gave the book 3 stars out of 5, saying, \\"This is the thinking person‚Äôs guide to Vikings. Novices may be overwhelmed by the amount of detail, and the shallow treatment of fantasy may discourage players who are less interested in mastering the Norse legal system than in hacking up sea monsters.

His entire priestly career was dedicated to ministering among the Oglala Native Americans. Fr. Manhart‚Äôs scholarly work in linguistics helped preserve and disseminate the living, native North American Lakota language. He was a firsthand witness and participant in the Wounded Knee incident of 1973.  Early life  Paul I. Manhart was born in Omaha, Nebraska, 2 January 1927, the third of twelve children of Paul Ignatius Manhart Sr. and Catherine Eleanor Steinauer Manhart. He attended Creighton Preparatory High School from 1941 to 1945. On his 18th birthday 2 January 1945 he entered the Society of Jesus at St. Stanislaus Seminary in Florissant, Missouri. He earned an A.B. (artium baccalaureus) in English and Latin from St. Louis University. In 1952 while still in Jesuit formation, Paul I. Manhart was assigned to teach at Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. In 1955 he moved to St. Mary's College (Kansas) where he was ordained a Catholic priest 18 June 1958.  Published works  Beginning in 1902, shortly after arriving in the United States from Germany, Fr. Eugene Buechel, S.J. taught Lakota boys English at the St. Francis Mission school on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. By the time of his death in 1954, Buechel had collected and translated over 28,000 Lakota words, intended to be aggregated into a dictionary. He preserved hundreds of oral histories, cultural objects, and interpretive information that is displayed at the Buechel Memorial Lakota Museum, St. Francis, South Dakota. Starting in 1955, at the request of Fr. John F. Bryde, principal of Holy Rosary Mission school, Fr. Manhart continued Buechal‚Äôs work by compiling, preparing and publishing in 1970 the first edition of Buechel‚Äôs Lakota Dictionary. Fr. George P Casey composed a brief version of Buechel‚Äôs A Grammar of Lakota so that it could be included in the dictionary. Five thousand case- bound books were printed, and in 1980, a second print-run of two thousand copies were produced. Buechel's collected Lakota terms were accompanied by their English definitions, pronunciations, parts of speech, examples of usage, and their sources.Buechel, Fr. Eugene and Manhart S.J., Fr. Paul, Lakota- English Dictionary,1st ed.: Pine Ridge, South Dakota: Holy Rosary Mission, 1970; 2nd ed.: University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London, Nebraska, 2002. p vii Around the time of the Wounded Knee incident of 1973, Fr. Manhart had borrowed Buechel's original manuscript of Lakota Tales and Texts from the Holy Rosary Mission archives with the intention to publish. As a result of the violent occupation, he and two local men, Benjamin White Butterfly and Ruben Mesteth found their office in shambles and the library shelves stripped of all its books‚Äîexcept the Tales and Texts manuscript. The original Lakota manuscript was rescued from destruction and in June of 1978, Fr. Manhart published Lakota Tales and Texts. It wasn't until 1993 that Fr. John Paul, superior of Holy Rosary Mission, asked Fr. Manhart (by then a recognized Lakota linguist) to take a sabbatical to translate and publish Buechel‚Äôs original manuscripts. After five additional years of effort, Fr. Manhart in 1998 commissioned Tipi Press to publish the two-volume set Lakota Tales and Texts in translation.Buechel, Fr. Eugene and Manhart S.J., Fr.

Manhart in 2002 completed his revision of the Lakota Dictionary to include English translations of the term usages, a second edition published by the University of Nebraska Press. Containing over thirty thousand entries, the Lakota Dictionary remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the Lakota language to date, serving everyone interested in preserving, speaking, and writing the language.

Wounded Knee incident  The Wounded Knee incident began 27 February 1973, on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, when approximately 200 Sioux Native Americans, in a military-style operation organized by Dennis Banks, Carter Camp, Clyde Bellecourt, Russell Means and members of the American Indian Movement, confronted Fr. Manhart at Sacred Heart Catholic Church and (using firearms) took him hostage along with ten other residents of the area (Clive Gildersleeve, Agnes Gildersleeve, Wilber Riegert, Girlie Clark, Bill Cole, Mary Pike, Addrienne Fritz, Jean Fritz, Guy Fritz, Annie Hunts Horse).New York Times, \\"Indians at Wounded Knee Free 11 Held for 2‚ÄêDays\\", March 2, 1973, p1 The takeover was described by an observer from the press as, ‚Äúa commando raid in the most accurate sense: well organized, lightning fast, and executed in almost total darkness‚Äù (Rapid City Journal, March 1, 1973, p.1)Lyman, Stanley David, Wounded Knee 1973, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London, Nebraska, 1991. p xxiii The Wounded Knee occupation by AIM lasted 71 days during which two Indian activists were killed‚Äîone struck in the head by a bullet that also pierced the wall of the Catholic church. At one of the roadblocks, U.S. Marshal Lloyd Grimm was seriously wounded when AIM militant gunfire struck his chest and left through his back.Spokane Daily Chronicle, ‚ÄúMarshall Wounded‚Äù, March 27, 1973, p2 The psychological stress of these events required evacuation to Rushville Hospital unconscious hostage Wilber Riegert (87 years of age), at which Fr.

When offered a chance to leave captivity, Fr. Manhart chose to remain in an effort to serve as a, ‚Äúbuffer between the AIM and government forces and that meaningful negotiations might result.‚Äù Omaha World Herald, \\"Serene Scene Greets Hill Hiking Newsmen\\", March 2, 1973, p22 During Means‚Äô federal trial, The Denver Post reported, ‚ÄúThe priest heard the front door unlocked from the inside. He walked quickly to the altar and observed 15 to 20 persons milling about. Four to six had shotguns and rifles and the others carried bayonets, machetes and clubs.‚Äù Means soon entered, and the priest said, ‚ÄúRussell, do you know this is a sacred place?‚Äù Means did not answer. In a few minutes he told his men, ‚ÄòTake him out of here. Take him to the basement and tie him up.‚Äù Thousands of rounds of ammunition were exchanged between AIM members and the FBI from their positions outside the church. After federal officials promised to investigate their complaint, AIM leaders and their supporters ended the occupation on 8 May 1973. On 16 September 1973, After an eight-and-a-half-month trial the U.S. District Court of South Dakota (Fred Joseph Nichol presiding judge) dismissed the charges against Banks and Means for conspiracy and assault because of the U.S. government‚Äôs unlawful handling of witnesses and evidence.Christenson, Ron, Political Trials, 2nd ed.

The Accords were signed by the directors of the national space agencies of the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Luxembourg, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates on October 13, 2020.  History  On 5 May 2020, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was drafting a new international agreement outlining the laws for mining on the Moon. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine officially announced the Artemis Accords on 15 May will be a series of a bilateral agreements between the nation states in the Artemis program. Accords The stated purpose of the Artemis Accords is to \\"provide for operational implementation of important obligations contained in the Outer Space Treaty and other instruments.\\" It is put into effect by a series of bilateral agreements between the signatory parties. The provisions call for * Affirm that cooperative activities under these Accords should be exclusively for peaceful purposes and in accordance with relevant international law. * Confirm a commitment to transparency and to share scientific information, consistent with Article XI of the Outer Space Treaty. * A commitment to use reasonable efforts to utilize current interoperability standards for space-based infrastructure, and to establish standards when they do not exist or are inadequate. * A commitment to take all reasonable efforts to render necessary assistance to personnel in outer space who are in distress and according to their obligations under the Rescue and Return Agreement. * Specifies responsibility for the registration of objects in space, as required by the Registration Convention * A commitment to publicly share information on their activities and to the opens sharing of scientific data. While doing so, signatories agree to coordinate with each other to provide appropriate protection for any proprietary and/or export-controlled information, and this provision does not extend to private sector operations unless conducted on behalf of a signatory. * An agreement to preserve outer space heritage, which they consider to comprise historically significant human or robotic landing sites, artifacts, spacecraft, and other evidence of activity, and to contribute to multinational efforts to develop practices and rules to do so. * An agreement that extraction and utilization of space resources should be conducted in a manner that complies with the Outer Space Treaty and in support of safe and sustainable activities. The signatories affirm that this does not inherently constitute national appropriation, which are prohibited by the Outer Space Treaty. They also express an intent to contribute to multilateral efforts to further develop international practices and rules on this subject. * Reaffirms the signatories commitment to the Outer Space Treaty's provisions relating to due regard and harmful interference with other nations activities, and to provide information regarding the location and nature of space-based activities. Signatories express an intention to contribute to multilateral efforts to further develop international practices, criteria, and rules to assure this. To implement this, the Accords provide for the announcement of \\"safety zones\\", where other operations or an anomalous event could reasonably cause harmful interference. The size and scope of these safe zones should be based on the nature and environment of the operations involved and determined in a reasonable manner leveraging commonly accepted scientific and engineering principles. Within their safety zones, the signatories commit to respect the principle of free access to all areas of celestial bodies by others and all other provisions of the Outer Space Treaty. * A commitment to mitigate space debris and to limit the generation of new, harmful space debris in the normal operations, break-up in operational or post-mission phases, and accidents. Russia has condemned the Artemis Accords as a blatant attempt to create international space law that favors the United States. Two researchers writing in Science magazine's Policy Forum have called on countries to speak up about their objections, and that the United States should go through the United Nations treaty process in order to negotiate on space mining. They were concerned NASA's bilateral agreements, if accepted by many nations, would enable the Accords' interpretation of the Outer Space Treaty to prevail and make the United States ‚Äîas the licensing nation for most of commercial space companies‚Äîthe de facto gatekeeper to the Moon and other bodies in the solar system. The United States has made acceptance of the Artemis Accords a prerequisite for participation in NASA's Artemis lunar program.

They formed some of the first Little Manila communities in the United States, and they played a pivotal role in the farmworker movement. The term manong comes from the Ilocano word for \\"elder brother,\\" while manang means \\"elder sister.\\"  History  In 1898, the United States entered a roughly fifty year period of colonial control in the Philippines. The Spanish American War (April-August 1898) ended Spanish colonial rule in the region, and the Philippines were ceded to the US in the Treaty of Paris. This was followed by the Philippine-American War (1899-1902), in which Filipino independence fighters, led by Emilio Aguinaldo, fought against American forces. The war was brutal, and total of 200,000 Filipino civilians died. Meanwhile, the US government, under William Howard Taft, launched a pacification campaign to win over support from Filipino elites, in 1900. This ultimately helped contribute to the defeat of the Filipino independence forces, and the war officially ended in 1902. Following the U.S. annexation of the Philippines, Filipinos began to emigrate to the United States. In 1903, the first documented group of Filipinos emigrated to the United States. The majority of Filipino immigrants were young, single males, who came to work in agricultural jobs in California and Hawaii. Many of the immigrants worked in farms and tanneries during the growing season. Some also worked in factories. The agricultural and factory work tended to be extremely physically demanding, with harsh conditions and low pay. During the agricultural off season, the manong often worked in cities and towns, such as San Francisco, in primarily service industry and domestic roles, such as cooks, waiters, hotel bellhops, hotel \\"elevator boys,\\" cleaners, chauffeurs, and house servants. Due to anti-miscegenation laws and immigration restrictions, such as the Immigration Act of 1924, it was difficult for many of the manong generation to find partners and start families. For this reason, many chose to create communities, such as Manilatown, San Francisco, where they lived in the same neighborhood and patronized Filipino restaurants, pool halls, and community spaces. They also formed Filipino community organizations, such as Gran Oriente Filipino Masonic and Caballeros de Dimas- Alang. It was common for the manong generation to live in low-cost, single room occupancy hotels, such as the International Hotel, when they were in cities. Many of the manong lived their entire lives as single men. In 1934, Filipino emigration closed down due to the passing of the Tydings-McDuffie Act. Furthermore, the act changed the status of the manong from US citizens to aliens. The manong generation participated in the labor and farmworker rights movement. For example, Filipino workers took part in the Delano grape strike in Delano, California, and some of the earliest meetings of the strike took place at the Filipino Hall. In 1965, Filipino immigration to the United States rose again, due to the Immigration and Nationality Act, which removed national origin quotas. This marked the end of the manong generation, as a new generation of Filipino emigrants were able to move to the United States and form families, without the previous legal restrictions.

The podcast follows Schubert as he reads the Harry Potter series for the first time. Each episode covers a section of the book series, as Schubert and at least one guest analyze the story, writing, and characters. In the US the podcast charts in the top 40 for Arts and Entertainment podcasts and in the top 60 for comedy podcasts on Spotify. History Schubert wanted to start a podcast and was looking for a popular topic that many people felt passionate about. He ‚Äúknew people have incredibly strong feelings about ‚ÄòHarry Potter,‚Äô but I hadn‚Äôt read the series,‚Äù and he believed an adult reading the series for the first time would be a promising topic. In an interview with The Rowling Library magazine, Schubert explained the origin of the name \\"Potterless\\" as a double pun based on both Pottermore (now Wizarding World) and the fact he had not read the series and so was Potter-less. Schubert started the podcast assuming his snarky remarks as he picked apart the books, counterpointed by his Potter-fan guests' outraged defense of the books, would be entertaining listening. He did not expect to enjoy the books but ended up enjoying them. According to TU Delfts' Delta, the podcast was conceptualized as one that would \\"pick apart the story and dethrone it from its lofty perch\\" but turns into one that \\"celebrates as the story gets richer.\\" Schubert began reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone, and the first episode of the podcast launched in October of that year. Episodes were initially released bi- weekly, but the release schedule was switched to weekly in 2019. The last book material was covered in episode 89, after which Schubert began covering the Harry Potter films and spin-off materials such as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Format Each episode of the first 89 is dedicated to a chapter or chapters of the book series in chronological reading order. Episodes are approximately 60 minutes in length, and consist primarily of Schubert and his guest(s) summarizing the plot and providing commentary. Recurring segments include British Quandaries, in which British citizen Dottie James answers questions from Mike and his American guests regarding British-isms and whether things such as treacle tart are British or magical in origin. Schubert donates a portion of his Patreon revenues to charity. Reception Potterless has charted in the US top 40 for Arts and Entertainment podcasts and US top 60 for comedy podcasts on Spotify.

Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity, and Andrew Walls, Director of the Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World (Now renamed as the Centre for the Study of World Christianity), the group gradually grew over the years and becomes a platform for the academic exchange of missiology and world Christianity. As of today, the conference holds alternatively between the venues of Edinburgh and New Haven. As a previous neighbour of Yale Divinity School, the Overseas Ministries Study Center also involves heavily in the conference. According to Dana L. Robert, 'the Yale- Edinburgh Conference reasserted the mediating role of the university-based divinity school as an incubator of scholarship that interwove postcolonial approaches to mission studies with secular historical and area studies....minus the triumphalism of previous generations, the conference demonstrated that university-based and other leading mainline seminaries still had a role to play as promoters of global connections and public scholarship.'

After rising to junior command positions during the Russian Civil War, Iovlev spent most of the 1920s and 1930s with the Soviet Border Troops. Decorated for his performance as a regimental commander during the Winter War, he commanded the 64th Rifle Division in Belarus when Operation Barbarossa began. Iovlev escaped from encirclement and commanded several divisions in the Battle of Moscow and after being relieved of command of the 194th Rifle Division in late 1942 was sent behind German lines to lead partisans. In early 1943 he became commander of the 215th Rifle Division, and in early 1944 was sent to complete a course. Ending the war as commander of an NKVD division in western Ukraine, Iovlev was chief of an NKVD school postwar before retiring in the early 1950s.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Iovlev was born on 30 September 1899 in the village of Krestovskoye, Shadrinsky Uyezd, Perm Governorate. He studied at a higher primary school and then a teachers' seminary in Shadrinsk from 1912. He joined the Shadrinsk druzhina of the Red Army on 24 February 1918 during the Russian Civil War. Sent to the front near Samara with a detachment in May, he participated in fighting against the Czechoslovak Legion. Captured by the Czechs in battle in the vicinity in June, Iovlev spent three months in the Samara prison, then was transferred to the Totskoye camp. He escaped from the latter two weeks later and hid among the local peasants until the capture of Buguruslan by the Red Army. Sent to a hospital in Moscow for treatment, he was assigned to a march battalion on arrival. From May 1919, Iovlev served as a Red Army man and platoon commander in the 104th Rifle Regiment of the 12th Rifle Division. He fought on the Southern Front with the unit against the Armed Forces of South Russia on the Don River, then in the Voronezh‚ÄìKastornoye and Donbass Operations.

Interwar period  Studying at the Lenin Combined Military School in Tashkent from November 1922, Iovlev fought in the elimination of Basmachi in the Chatkal valley with a cadet detachment. Completing training at the school in August 1924, he was posted to Arkhangelsk to serve as a platoon leader in the regimental school of the 29th Rifle Regiment of the 10th Rifle Division. Transferred to the Border Troops in October 1925, Iovlev was appointed assistant commandant of a sector of the Petrozavodsk Border Detachment. He was sent to study at the Frunze Military Academy in October 1927 and upon graduation in May 1930 became a tactics instructor at the Higher Border School in Moscow. From October 1931, he served as a sector head in the OGPU personnel directorate. Iovlev held a succession of positions with the OGPU and NKVD Troops through the 1930s, beginning with the 1st Belorussian NKVD Regiment at Minsk in May 1933. In August 1934 he became chief of staff of the 4th Border School in Saratov, then chief of the Magnitnaya Border Detachment in August 1936. Appointed chief of the combat training section of the staff of the North Caucasus NKVD District at Rostov- on-Don in February 1938, Iovlev served as assistant chief of the combat training department of the staff of the NKVD Border Troops in Moscow from May 1939.  World War II  In December 1939, Iovlev became commander of the 97th Rifle Regiment of the 18th Rifle Division of the 15th Army of the Northwestern Front, fighting in the Winter War. For his \\"courage and heroism\\" in the exit from encirclement of the garrison of south Lemetti as part of the detachment of Kombrig Kozlov, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 20 May 1940. He was appointed commander of the 64th Rifle Division of the Western Special Military District, stationed in Belarus, on 8 June. After Operation Barbarossa began, Iovlev led the 64th in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk, defending the approaches to Minsk as part of the 13th Army. He was credited with \\"skilfully organizing\\" the anti-tank defenses of the division, which allowed the division to hold its positions for a week, although suffering heavy losses. Facing encirclement, the remnants of the division retreated towards the Berezina River and then Smolensk. Iovlev led a group northeast. They acted as partisans before reaching Soviet lines on 26 September in the area of Bely in the sector of the 29th Army.

He led the division as part of the 36th Rifle Corps during the Smolensk‚ÄìRoslavl Offensive, in which it recaptured Smolensk and crossed the Sozh River, receiving the name of Smolensk as an honorific in recognition of its actions. Iovlev's performance in the latter was evaluated by his superior as displaying initiative and personal bravery by leading from the front. He temporarily commanded the corps, defending positions in eastern Belarus, between 17 and 29 February 1944. Sent to study at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy in April, he completed an accelerated course there on 29 December and in January 1945 was appointed commander of the 59th NKVD Rifle Division of the Lvov Military District.

In 1897, he began an open affair with the famous opera singer and beauty Lina Cavalieri and spent huge sums of money on her. His passion for her was serious, and he asked the Emperor Nicholas II to give him permission to marry her, but his parents did all they could to prevent this from happening. In the summer of 1896, they had already had similar trouble, as they saw it, when their youngest son, Vladimir Baryatinsky, secretly married an actress, Yavorskaya. Their oldest son was heir to the dynasty of the Baryatinsky, and a marriage with Cavalieri would have discredited the whole family.

It is taken by mouth. Ripretinib is a kinase inhibitor, meaning it works by blocking a type of enzyme called a kinase, which helps keep the cancer cells from growing. The most common side effects include alopecia (hair loss), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia (muscle pain), diarrhea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (a skin reaction in the palms and soles) and vomiting. Alopecia is a unique side effect to ripretinib, which is not seen with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat GISTs. Ripretinib was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020, and in Australia in July 2020. Ripretinib is the first new drug specifically approved in the United States as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).  Medical uses  Ripretinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a type of tumor that originates in the gastrointestinal tract, who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitor therapies, including imatinib. GIST is type of stomach, bowel, or esophagus tumor.  Adverse effects  The most common side effects include alopecia (hair loss), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia (muscle pain), diarrhea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (a skin reaction in the palms and soles) and vomiting. Ripretinib can also cause serious side effects including skin cancer, hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiac dysfunction manifested as ejection fraction decrease (when the muscle of the left ventricle of the heart is not pumping as well as normal). Ripretinib may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby.  History  Ripretinib was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020. The approval of ripretinib was based on the results of an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (INVICTUS/NCT03353753) that enrolled 129 participants with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who had received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. The trial compared participants who were randomized to receive ripretinib to participants who were randomized to receive placebo, to determine whether progression free survival (PFS) ‚Äì the time from initial treatment in the clinical trial to growth of the cancer or death ‚Äì was longer in the ripretinib group compared to the placebo group. During treatment in the trial, participants received ripretinib 150 mg or placebo once a day in 28-day cycles, repeated until tumor growth was found (disease progression), or the participant experienced intolerable side effects. After disease progression, participants who were randomized to placebo were given the option of switching to ripretinib. The trial was conducted at 29 sites in the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) based on assessment by blinded independent central review (BICR) using modified RECIST 1.1 in which lymph nodes and bone lesions were not target lesions and a progressively growing new tumor nodule within a pre- existing tumor mass must meet specific criteria to be considered unequivocal evidence of progression. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall response rate (ORR) by BICR and overall survival (OS). The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for participants in the ripretinib arm compared with those in the placebo arm (HR 0.15; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.25; p<0.0001). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for ripretinib priority review and fast track designations, as well as breakthrough therapy designation and orphan drug designation. The FDA granted approval of Qinlock to Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada on the review of the application as part of Project Orbis. The FDA approved ripretinib three months ahead of schedule. , the review of the applications was ongoing for the Australian TGA and for Health Canada.

In the summer of 1830, Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá persuaded the people of Jagodina to accuse Mileta of numerous injustices that he allegedly did to them. He also instructed some women and girls in Jagodina to accuse Mileta of adultery. At the end of the trial, Milo≈° forgave Prince Mileta. Milo≈° initiated this trial to show Mileta and the other princes that he was the \\"true master of Serbia\\". Since then, Mileta stopped supporting Obrenoviƒá and become his opponent. In January 1831, Prince Milo≈° informed a great national assembly that he had obtained an imperial edict from the Sultan ending all direct obligations of Serbian peasants to their former Turkish lords, guaranteeing Ottoman recognition of Serbian autonomy in most matters of internal administration, and offering Serbia the prospect of territorial aggrandizement, as well as the express right to institute schools, courts, and a governmental administration of her own. The Sultan's decrees of 1830 and 1833 expanded the same rights to a larger territory, and made Serbia a sovereign principality,with Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá as the hereditary prince. A Metropolitanate of Belgrade was established as an autonomous unit of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Russia's status as the guarantor of Serbia's autonomy was also recognized. When the Principality of Serbia was divided into Serdars in 1834, Mileta was appointed Grand Duke of the Rasina serdar, one of the five serdars into which the then Serbia was divided. In 1835, Mileta Radojkoviƒá led the biggest revolt against Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, which became popularly known as Mileta's revolt. The rebels rose up with the intention of limiting the prince's power by imposing a new constitution. The prince was forced to adopt the Sretenje Constitution (La Constitution de la Sainte Rencontre de 1835)in Kragujevac, the then capital of Serbia, which limited the prince's rights and partially transferred them to the State Council. By the Constitution of Sretenje, Mileta was appointed one of the five ministers in Serbia - the Minister of War (\\"Guardian of Military Affairs\\") and thus became a member of the State Council, which played the role of the government of the Principality of Serbia. However, Milo≈° with the support of foreign powers soon dismissed all the ministers he had appointed by the Constitution of Sretenje, so that Mileta was replaced on 16 March of the same year.–ú–µ—í—É—Ç–∏–º –ú–∏–ª–æ—à —ò–µ —É–±—Ä–∑–æ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ—à–∏–æ —Å–≤–µ –º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–µ –∫–æ—ò–µ —ò–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–æ –°—Ä–µ—Ç–µ—ö—Å–∫–∏–º —É—Å—Ç–∞–≤–æ–º, —Ç–∞–∫–æ –¥–∞ —ò–µ –ú–∏–ª–µ—Ç–∞ —Å–º–µ—ö–µ–Ω –≤–µ—õ 16. –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–µ –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ The move was opposed by neighbouring Austria, the ruling Ottoman Empire and Imperial Russia.It is believed that the three great empires saw the Sretenje Constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government. Metternich's Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and foreign ministry. Milo≈° abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and Turkey, and it was replaced by the \\"Turkish\\" Constitution of 1838. When the older Constitution (the \\"Turkish Constitution\\") was re-enacted in the Principality of Serbia in 1838, Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá appointed seventeen members of the Council and the Grand Court, including Mileta Radojkoviƒá. On June 11, 1842, he became an honorary member of the Society Of Serbian Letters. During the First Serbian Uprising, as the Nahija prince Mileta, he renovated the Monastery of Saint Nikola Mirlikijski in Svojnovo. He built today's church and today's old eastern residence from the remains of the destroyed monastery. Mileta Radojkoviƒá died on September 26, 1852. He was buried in Varvarin next to the Church of the Holy Mother of God. Legacy The street in Belgrade in the municipality of Stari grad was named after him - Knez Miletina Street, and also a street in Jagodina is named after him.

He served in the War of American Independence, earning membership in the Society of the Cincinnati.  Biography  Framond was born to the family of Jeanne Marie Elisabeth C√©sarine de Rochefort d'Ailly, and of Louis Fran√ßois Framond de Gr√®zes, from G√©vaudan. His brothers Charles-Auguste Framond de Gr√®zes and √âtienne Aim√© Fran√ßois Framond de La Framondie also served in the Navy. Framond joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine in 1748. he was promoted to Lieutenant in 1757. In 1765, Framond commanded the 20-gun xebec Cam√©l√©on during the Larache expedition. In 1770, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis. In 1773, Framond was first officer on the 74-gun Protecteur, for a journey from Brest to Toulon. In 1776, he commanded the 26-gun frigate Mignonne for missions to Greece and Cyprus. Framond was promoted to Captain in 1778, and given command of the 32-gun Sultane. He cruised between Cyprus and Toulon, ferrying diplomatic despatches. In 1780, he captained the 64-gun Caton, part of the squadron under Guichen. Caton was later attached to the squadron commanded by De Grasse. He took part in the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780, as well as in the two smaller engagements of 15 and 19 May 1780. At the Battle of Fort Royal, on 29 April 1781, Caton was one of the four ships to come reinforce the squadron under De Grasse, along with Victoire, R√©fl√©chi and Solitaire. He took part in the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781, where he was wounded. On 24 March 1782, he was promoted to Chef de Division. On 10 April 1782, in the run-up to the Battle of the Saintes, Caton found herself becalmed and Framond asked for assistance. Despite having been sent a frigate, Framond decided to anchor at Basse-Terre without authorisation from his hierarchy. He thus failed to take part in the Battle of the Saintes, and a few days after, on 19 April 1782, Caton was captured at the Battle of the Mona Passage. Framond was court-martialed on 27 February 1783 and found guilty. He was expelled from the Navy and imprisoned at Ch√¢teau de Ham to serve a life sentence.

The virus then spread rapidly through the Navajo Nation to the point that the Navajo have a higher per capita rate of infection than any state of the United States. The population according to the 2010 United States Census was 173,667. , the number of confirmed cases was 11,540. A June 2020 concluded that the high rate of COVID-19 infection on the Navajo Nation is influenced by a multitude of underlying issues prevalent on the reservation, such as lack of access to quality healthcare, poverty, and community behavior.  Timeline  = 2020 =  February  On February 27, the Navajo Nation COVID-19 Preparedness Team was established to coordinate efforts to raise awareness and arrange preparations for the virus. The team consisted of officials from Navajo and Federal government agencies. At this time, Michael D. Weahkee, the Assistant Surgeon General and Principal Deputy Director of the Indian Health Service (IHS), said that the risk of contracting COVID-19 was \\"low\\".  March  In a meeting on March 2 with the Navajo Nation Council's Naabi'iyati' Committee, the executive director of the Navajo Nation Department of Health Jill Jim said the Navajo Nation was a low-risk area. The Navajo and Hopi Families COVID-19 Relief Fund was established on March 15 by former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch. The Relief Fund provides aid to elders raising their grandchildren, struggling families, single parents, and those with compromised immune systems. The Navajo Nation is on portions of the U.S. states of northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and northwestern New Mexico. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey ordered all schools in the state to close on March 16. The Navajo Gaming Board of Directors temporarily closed all casino facilities beginning March 17. The pandemic reached the Navajo Nation on March 17 after a 46-year old from Chilchinbito, Arizona (Tsii'chin Bii' T√≥) tested positive for COVID-19. In response, the Navajo Health Command Operations center issued a Public Health Emergency Order to \\"shelter-in-place\\" Chilchinbeto beginning March 19. Many of the early cases were later linked to the Chilchinbeto Church of the Nazarene Zone Rally held on March 7. On March 18, Coconino County, Arizona declared a state of emergency, and Navajo County, Arizona Sheriff David Clouse suspended jail visitation. On March 20, President Jonathan Nez issued a stay-at-home order for the entire Navajo Nation after 14 cases of the coronavirus were confirmed, with an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew enforced. Those found in violation of curfew may face up to 30 days in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000.

Navajo Nation Police also began issuing fines and citations to those violating the imposed curfew. On April 7, a man in Page, Arizona was arrested on a felony charge on suspicion of attempting to incite an act of terrorism for claiming on a Facebook post that Navajo peoples were all infected with COVID-19 and called for the use of \\"lethal force\\" against Navajo to stop the virus from spreading. Beginning April 10, a 57-hour weekend curfew was declared. The Health Command Center was tasked to declare subsequent weekend curfews. At that point, there were 698 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 24 deaths, among members of the Navajo Nation living in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. On April 15, the Navajo Police Department announced that nine of their police officers were confirmed positive for COVID-19. By April 18, there were 1,197 cases.

Antrim's home ground is Casement Park, Belfast. The team's manager is Lenny Abrahamson. The team last won the Ulster Senior Championship in 1951, but has never won the All-Ireland Senior Championship or the National League. History Liam Bradley (left), former manager of the Antrim seniors, with Armagh manager Peter McDonnell (right) at the launch of the 2009 Dr McKenna Cup Antrim were the first Ulster county to appear in an All Ireland final, in 1911 and repeated the feat again in 1912, losing on both occasions. Antrim's surprise football semi-final success came out of the blue in 1911. The Ulster secretary got sick that year and never organised a provincial Championship. So Antrim arrived with no practice to play Kilkenny and won by 3-1 to 1-1. The following year they beat Kerry. Heavy rain on the day, and over-indulgence at a wedding the day before were blamed for the shock 3-5 to 0-2 defeat. Antrim's County Board decision to introduce a City League in 1908, one of the first in Gaelic history, was a more legitimate explanation. The 1946 Antrim football team was regarded as one of the most exciting of the era, taking advantage of the newly reintroduced handpass. Joe McCallin's two goals helped beat Cavan in the Ulster final but Kerry roughed them out of the All Ireland semi-final. The opening of Casement Park boosted the games in Belfast, but from the late 1960s the troubles hampered sporting life in the football heartlands of Belfast, particularly Ardoyne. Political violence meant that the county could not build on the under-21 team of 1969, one of the finest in Ulster history (Din Joe McGrogan, scorer of the goals that put Antrim in the final, was killed by a Loyalist bomb). The county's Vocational Schools team has made it to 2 All Ireland Finals in 1968 where they beat Galway and in 1971 where they were beaten by Mayo. A drawn Ulster semi-final with Derry in 2000 was one of the highlights of Antrim's recent football career alongside winning the Tommy Murphy Cup in 2008, beating Wicklow in the final and gaining revenge for losing the 2007 final to the same opponents. Antrim reached the 2009 Ulster Championship final, the first Antrim team to do so for 31 years. They were runners-up to All-Ireland champions Tyrone.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Ulster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Fermanagh's home ground is Brewster Park, Enniskillen. The team's manager is Mickey Harte. The team has never won the Ulster Senior Championship, the All-Ireland Senior Championship or the National League. History Fragments of a poem from 1806 describe a football match between Louth and Fermanagh at Inniskeen, County Monaghan. Fermanagh are the only team in their province to have never won the Ulster Senior Football Championship. Fermanagh beat Cavan in the 1914 Ulster semi-final and were nominated by the Ulster Council to play against Wexford in the All-Ireland semi-final. Because the train schedules did not allow them to get back for Sunday night, and the Great Northern Railway Company refused to run a special train because they were opposed to sport on Sunday, Fermanagh had to abdicate the responsibility to Monaghan, who later beat them in the Ulster final anyway. One of Ulster's great footballers, Armagh-born Jim McCullough, played for Fermanagh in the mid-1930s and helped them reach the 1935 Ulster final and 1936 National League final. Peter McGinnity was the outstanding player of the under-21 team which reached two All Ireland finals and defeated Derry and Tyrone to reach the 1982 Ulster final, Despite a Peter McGinnity goal that put them in the lead with 20 minutes remaining, they lost 0-10 to 1-4 to Armagh. Under manager Pat King, they managed a hat-trick of success in 1997 in the B Championship, McKenna Cup and Division 4 of the National League. beating Derry in 2008 and joining Armagh in the final. That game was played on 20 July 2008, a closely fought game finishing in a draw after normal time. Armagh eventually ran out winners by 6 points in the replayed game on 27 July. Fermanagh were a beneficiary of the change to the GAA championship in the 2000s. In 2003, in Charlie Mulgrew's first season in charge, they beat Donegal in the Ulster championship, then Meath and Mayo in the All Ireland qualifiers to reach the quarter-final. They went to a replayed semi-final in 2004, beating Meath, Cork and Donegal and most memorably of all Armagh, thanks to a late point by Tom Brewster, before losing to Mayo. In 2006 despite running All-Ireland favourites Armagh close twice in the Ulster Championship, Fermanagh yet again ended the season without a trophy after losing out to neighbours Donegal in the fourth round of the Qualifiers. The 2007 season saw Fermanagh lose their National League Division one status having failed to register a single point from the seven match campaign. They performed quite well in the championship however, only losing by an injury-time point to Tyrone in Ulster. They defeated Wexford (for the second consecutive season) in the first round of the all-Ireland qualifiers. However, they were unable to record a third win in four seasons over Meath in Navan in July, losing narrowly by two points despite dominating the latter stages. Charlie Mulgrew, manager for four seasons, stood down after this match. He was succeeded by Malachy O'Rourke. O'Rourke's first season led to promotion from Division 3 and a first appearance in an Ulster Final for 26 years, losing eventually in a replay against Armagh.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Leinster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Kildare's home ground is St Conleth's Park, Newbridge. The team's manager is Jack O'Connor. The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 2000, the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 1928 and has never won the National League. History Donegal defeated Kildare in the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in Jim McGuinness's first season in charge. Kildare first entered the All- Ireland Senior Football Championship in 1888, and lost to Dublin by a score of 2‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì1. Kildare made a major contribution towards the evolution of rules and tactics in Gaelic football. The county was the first to abandon the tradition of playing 21 people on each team, using 16 on each team for a period. Kildare players invented the hand pass: a polished team tactic since 1903; The toe-to-hand was pioneered by the Roseberry (now Newbridge Sarsfields) club. A team made up of players from the two strongest clubs in the county, Roseberry and Clane, played Kerry three times for the All-Ireland Championship of 1903; the matches drew the first mass interest in a field sport in the country, had an aggregate attendance of 50,000, and were regarded as the games which \\"made the GAA.\\" Kildare's four All-Ireland titles were won between 1905 and 1928: over Kerry in 1905, Galway in 1919, and Kerry again in the 1927 and 1928 finals. Kildare became the first team to win the Sam Maguire Cup in 1928. They haven't won it since. Tactics such as the hand pass were perfected by those early Kildare teams, but they also developed what became traditional catch-and-kick football. Olympic high jumper Larry Stanley was regarded as one of the greatest fielders in the history of the game, and first winner of the all-time All Star award. Despite winning a Leinster Senior Football Championship in 1956, reaching the National League final in 1958 and 1968, and winning the All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship in 1965, Kildare footballers seemed to have difficulty maintaining their proud tradition. The county lost six Leinster finals in the twelve years between 1966 and 1978. Although the Raheens club won a Leinster Senior Club Football Championship title in 1983. In 1991, former Kerry manager Mick O'Dwyer took charge of the county football team. Kildare lost two more Leinster finals to Dublin in 1992 and 1993, as well as the National League final of 1991. When Dublin came back for a draw in 1994 and won the replay, O'Dwyer was succeeded by Dermot Earley for two years. He returned in 1997, and guided the county to victory over Laois with 13 players and a dramatic, twice replayed series of matches with Meath (which they lost) that captured the imagination of the public and steeled the side for further honors. In 1998, the Kildare team became the only team in 110 years of championship football to beat the previous three champions, Dublin, Meath and Kerry in turn only to lose to Galway in the All-Ireland final; despite leading by three points at half time. Another Leinster followed in 2000, but Galway defeated them in the semi-final. Leinster Final defeats followed in 2002 and 2003, against Dublin and a Laois side back-boned by their All-Ireland MFC winning sides of the late 1990s. In (2005), Kildare enjoyed mixed success and finished in the top six in the National Football League, but was knocked out of the championship by Sligo.http://www.rte.ie/sport In 2008 under the new management of Kieran McGeeney Kildare made a bit of unfortunate history by becoming the first team ever to lose a championship game to Wicklow in Croke Park, losing in the first round by 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì9. However Kildares season took a turn for the better after that by beating Cavan, Limerick and Fermanagh in the all- Ireland qualifiers to reach their first ever all-ireland quarter-final. To date in 2009, an improved Kildare side reached the Leinster Final only to suffer a defeat to Dublin. Kildare advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-final to play then All- Ireland champions Tyrone after beating Wicklow only to be knocked out by Tyrone. 2010 saw Kildare lose to Louth in the 2nd round. However Kildare had a great run through the qualifiers beating teams like Antrim, Leitrim, Derry and Monaghan to once again reach the All-Ireland Quarter-final to face Leinster champions Meath which they got a slow start but enjoyed the 2nd half as they ran out winning 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì12. to reach the All-Semi-final for the first time since 2000. On 29 August 2010 Kildare faced Down for the first time ever in the championship which turned out to be a very tense game but Down ran out winners 1‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì14 after a very frantic finish. 2011 saw Kildare advance to the Leinster semi-final after defeating Meath in the Leinster quarter-final only to be defeated by Dublin. Kildare had a good run in the qualifiers beating teams like Laois, Meath & Derry to advance to the All-Ireland quarter- final to face Ulster champions Donegal which turned to be a very poor performance but the 2nd half was a real contest from both sides with the sides finishing level to drag the game into extra-time only to be defeated by a single point by Donegal.

During the mid-2000s Laois football became a strong force at all age levels. Under former Kerry and Kildare manager Mick O'Dwyer, Laois were National Football League runners-up and Leinster Senior Football Championship winners in 2003. Laois would go on to contest the Leinster Senior Football Championship Final again in 2004 (lost after a replay) and 2005 (lost by 1 point). During the same period the Minor team were All-Ireland Minor Champions in 2003, and Leinster Champions in 2004, 2005 and 2007, while the U-21 panel were Leinster Champions in 2006 and 2007. In 2006, Mick O'Dwyer's management of Laois ended and he was replaced by the former Limerick manager, Liam Kearns. After two years Liam Kearns was replaced by Sean Dempsey in 2008. Dempsey who had led the Laois minors to All-Ireland success in 2003 commenced a major re-building exercise in 2009 but failed to achieve any success and was replaced by Justin McNulty for the 2011 season. After three seasons in charge, McNulty stepped down to be replaced by Tom√°s √ì Flatharta. √ì Flatharta lasted until 2015, resigning after a Leinster quarter- final loss to Kildare and an All-Ireland qualifier exit against Antrim. Mick Lillis from Clare replaced him. Lillis led Laois to bottom of Division 2, a Leinster quarter-final exit and then an All-Ireland qualifier exit to Clare before he resigned in 2016. He also used seven substitutes in a win causing the game to be replayed, complained about a fixture against Dublin being held at Nowlan Park and dropped Gary Walsh when he cursed at him after being substituted. Peter Creedon was the next manager; he too did not last long, exiting under heavy criticism from county board delegates, with Mick Lawlor claiming the county would be set \\"back by five or six years\\" if Creedon were not ousted. He went, amid allegations of a drinking culture within the squad, Laois having been relegated to Division 4 and knocked out of the All-Ireland by Clare. In September 2017, John Sugrue from Kerry was appointed senior manager of the Laois football team. He spent two seasons with the county, guiding them to two promotions that brought them from Division Four to Division Two of the National Football League, making Round Four of the All- Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifiers in both years and bringing Laois to the 2018 Leinster Senior Football Championship final. In October 2019, Mike Quirke, another Kerryman, succeeded Sugrue.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Connacht Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Leitrim's home ground is P√°irc Se√°n Mac Diarmada, Carrick-on-Shannon. The team's manager is Terry Hyland. The team last won the Connacht Senior Championship in 1994, but has never won the All-Ireland Senior Championship or the National League. Considered \\"Connacht's traditional minnows\\" and \\"one of the GAA's Cinderella counties\\", Leitrim is never considered seriously as likely to win a major title. History Leitrim's football history has brought sparse reward. They first competed in the All-Ireland in the 1907 championship. They were beaten by Roscommon on a score of 0-03 to 0-01 in the Connacht semi-final in their first ever match. The county won its first ever match in the 1910 championship, beating Sligo in the Connacht quarter-final by 0-03 to 0-00. They were then beaten by Galway in the semi-final. Leitrim did not record another win until the 1914 championship. They beat Sligo by 5-07 0-02 to qualify for their first ever Connacht final but were beaten by Roscommon in the decider. In the semi-final of the 1924 Connacht Championship, Leitrim forced Mayo to a draw, then refused to play extra-time. Galway went on to be beaten in the final by Mayo following a replay. In 1927, with training from Sean O'Hehir, father of the veteran radio commentator Miche√°l and with the help of good fortune when Connacht semi-finalists Roscommon had to line out without five players whose car had broken down, Leitrim won their first ever Connacht title. Leitrim won the Connacht title and held Kerry to two points in the semi-final of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. In the days of Cathal Flynn, Colin McNulty and Packie McGarty, both Connacht Railway Cup players, Leitrim lost four successive Connacht finals to Galway between 1957 and 1960, coming closest in 1958 when they equalised midway through the second half but were defeated by two points (Cathal Flynn scored 1-6). Flynn retired in 1966 from inter-county football while McGarty was at the end of his career when Leitrim were heavily beaten by a score 4-15 to 0-7 against Mayo in the Connacht final in 1967, scoring only one point from play. Leitrim won the National Football League Division 2 title and contested the 1959 NFL semi- final with a changed fullback line but were beaten by Derry by seven points. A new generation of Leitrim under-21 players hosted and nearly beat the great Kerry team at Carrick-on-Shannon in 1977 before losing by five points, 3-13 to 3-8. The expected breakthrough from Michael Martin and his men never happened. John O'Mahony was appointed Leitrim manager to build on the success of the Under-21 team that won the 1991 Connacht Championship. He took Leitrim to the final of the 1994 Connacht Championship. Leitrim did not have an easy route to the final, beating Roscommon by a point and only overcoming Galway by a point in a replay. They took on Mayo in the final, overcoming O'Mahony's native county by two points in Hyde Park. O'Mahony's feat in leading the team that is traditionally the weakest in the province to that title is still heralded nationally to this day. Leitrim were ultimately beaten in the All-Ireland semi-final by Dublin at Croke Park. Since losing to Sligo in 1989, Leitrim had suffered a series of near-misses, and might have followed up 1994 against Galway, losing by a single point in 1995 and two points in 1996. The first county to benefit under the parentage rule was also the first to lose their big catch, with the loss of Declan Darcy to Dublin depleting the panel in 1998, bringing Leitrim's most successful era to an end. Leitrim sprung a massive shock when they won the FBD Insurance League in 2013, defeating their southern neighbours Sligo in the final. This was the county's fourth ever trophy and their first since 1994. As the Irish Independent reported, \\"There may have been no danger of any cows going unmilked in Leitrim after this game, but winning their first FBD League title ‚Äì and their first trophy in 19 years ‚Äì sparked off some understandable early season celebrations for Connacht's traditional minnows\\". They retained the title in 2014, defeating Roscommon in the final. The county's Vocational Schools team have made it to two All- Ireland Vocational Schools Championship Finals losing to Carlow in 1972 and Donegal in 1995. Next overseas championship trips for Leitrim for London moved from 2022 to 2023 while New York expected to be moved from 2023 to 2024 due to COVID-19 a change of rotional year is required for London and New York games.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Leinster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Louth's home ground is Drogheda Park, Drogheda. The team's manager is Wayne Kierans. The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 1957, the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 1957 and has never won the National League. History The earliest recorded inter-county football match took place in 1712 when Louth faced Meath at Slane.http://www.the-kingdom.ie/news/story/?trs=cwsnkfauoj A fragment of a poem from 1806 records a football match between Louth and Fermanagh at Inniskeen, Co Monaghan. When Louth GAA sent the team into training in Dundalk for the 1913 Croke Memorial replay under a soccer trainer from Belfast, the move caused more than a ripple through the Association. For thirty years full- time training in bursts of a week or so before a big match were common. After that the two or three times a week gatherings became more popular. Between 1945 and 1953 Louth and Meath met 13 times. The crowds got bigger and bigger each time as they played draw after draw in the Championship. The attendance of 42,858 at a thrilling 1951 replay remained a record for a provincial match other than a final for forty years the four match series between Meath and Dublin in 1991. The rivalry with Meath has never fizzled out, as witnessed by a stirring Leinster semi-final in 1998. Nor has controversy, as witnessed by Graham Geraghty's \\"wide\\" 45th minute point. In 1957 showband star Dermot O'Brien was late for the All-Ireland final and joined the team when the parade was completed. Prior to the game O'Brien had captained the side in the semi final success, when the regular captain Patsy Coleman had been injured. Both Ardee men tossed a coin to see who would captain the team. O'Brien won the toss. Coleman today still has the match ball. O'Brien played a key role as Louth beat Cork with the help of a goal from Sean Cunningham with five minutes to go. Dermot O'Brien died on 21 May 2007. As both Cork and Louth wear Red and White, on that day Louth wore the green of Leinster, while Cork wore the blue of Munster. Eamonn McEneaney was manager from 2006 to 2009 and guided them to their most recent success, the O'Byrne Cup when they defeated DCU in the 2009 final played in the Gaelic Grounds in Drogheda. On 27 June 2010, Louth reached their first Leinster Senior Championship Final in 50 years. During the Leinster Final on 11 July that year, anger and controversy erupted when, during the 74th minute of the match against Meath, a goal was awarded by the referee after brief consultation with only one of the match umpires (although close circuit camera evidence shown on the RT√â Two coverage of the game proved that the ball was carried over the line by a Meath player). However, Meath received the 2010 Leinster Title and the cup. Louth have been represented by two players in the International Rules versus Australia in recent years, Paddy Keenan and Ciaran Byrne. =2010 Leinster Football Final= On 11 July 2010, Louth reached the Leinster Senior Football Championship Final where they took on neighbours Meath. Meath won what was a highly controversial match. Deep into injury time in the 74th minute of the match, the referee awarded a highly contentious goal to Meath. He did so after a brief consultation with only one of the match umpires, although television coverage of the game showed that the ball had been carried over the line by Meath player Joe Sherdian. Prior to the referee's decision, Meath were trailing Louth by one point. The referee blew his whistle shortly afterwards. The \\"goal\\" proved to be the decisive score. Irate Louth fans stormed the pitch and commenced a process of chasing and physically assaulting the referee, who had to be led away by a Garda escort in scenes broadcast to a live television audience. Other scenes of violence saw bottles being hurled from a stand, one striking a steward who fell to the ground and Meath substitute Mark Ward was hit by a Louth fan. The situation led to much media debate in the days that followed, the violence was condemned and there were many calls in the national media for the game to be replayed (including from former Meath players Trevor Giles and Bernard Flynn). GAA President Christy Cooney said the events were a \\"watershed\\" and one where the \\"circumstances were bizarre. I have never seen circumstances like it as long as I have been a member of this Association\\". He promised life bans for those who assaulted the referee. The day after the match the GAA released a statement confirming that Sludden admitted he had made an error. The GAA also stated that the rules left it powerless to offer a replay and that this would be decided by Meath. Following a Meath County Board meeting it emerged that, in his match report, the referee had originally blown for a penalty for Meath but when the ball ended up in the net he decided to award the \\"goal\\" instead. The county board decided not to offer a replay and judged that that would be \\"the end of the matter\\". This decision was met in some quarters with mixed feelings and commented upon in one national newspaper, the Evening Herald, by three times All-Ireland winning manager Mickey Harte who said the Meath county board was even more culpable because their officers had time to form a considered opinion. In the statement, the Louth County Board spoke of the enormous sense of injustice which was being felt in Louth GAA. They also questioned the referee's official report saying it was contrary to Playing Rules where he indicated in his report that he blew the whistle for a penalty, but then changed his mind and awarded a goal instead. The referee also wrote that \\"he made a terrible mistake\\". Louth County board referred to Rule 6.41 Award //facts of game: The award of the game rests with the committee / council in charge acting on the referees report. In doing so the Louth County Board intimated that the committee/council in charge erred in leaving the matter to Meath County Board to offer a replay without seeking clarification from the referee in relation to his match report and his statement that \\"he made a terrible mistake\\". The debate concerning which team were official winners of the game is now over, with Meath recorded in the annals of history as the victors. However, numerous TV replays show that the Meath \\"goal\\" was indisputably a technical foul with regard to the Playing Rules of Gaelic football, as quoted below and as outlined in the GAA Official Guide. Also Paddy Keenan (St.Patricks) is the only Louth All-Star. - Part 2. =2010 All- Ireland Qualifiers= Louth exited the All-Ireland championship on July 24 when defeated fairly convincingly by Dublin in the last qualifier round by 2-14 to 0-13.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Ulster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Monaghan's home ground is St Tiernach's Park, Clones. The team's manager is S√©amus McEnaney. The team last won the Ulster Senior Championship in 2015 and the National League in 1985. The team has never won the All-Ireland Senior Championship. History Football was recorded in Inniskeen in 1706 in a poem. Monaghan were prominent in Ulster championship competitions during the period 1914-30 and one of the first Ulster counties to contest an All-Ireland final. Monaghan beat Kildare in a semi-final to reach the 1930 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, where Kerry beat them by 3-11 to 0-2 without their goalkeeper touching the ball. In 1979 the Monaghan team won the Ulster Senior Football Championship for the first time in 41 years with a defeat of Donegal. In the final Monaghan Kieran Finlay scored 1-09, which was a record in an Ulster final for 20 years, until Armagh's Oisin McConville bettered it with a 2-07 tally against Down in 1999. They also won the Dr McKenna Cup in 1979. Victories in the Ceannarus Tournament against Roscommon and Dublin in 1979 brought gloss to the county's finest year on the football field in almost half a century. In the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1979 semi-final at Croke Park, Monaghan were again beaten by Kerry, 5-14 to 0-07. In 1984 the Centenary Cup final was reached following wins over Limerick, Mayo, Offaly (quarter final) and Derry (semi-final after extra time) The Offaly and Derry games were played in Croke Park as was the final against Meath which Monaghan lost by 0-10 to 0-08. Monaghan also won Division 3 of the National Football League that year and lost to Meath in the quarterfinal. 1985 was the county's most successful year to date when a National Football League final victory against Armagh in 1985 created a momentum that peaked in 1985 when future Monaghan manager Eamonn McEneaney kicked one of the most spectacular equalizing points in many years from 48 metres out near the sideline beside the Hogan Stand to draw the All-Ireland semi-final against Kerry on a scoreline of Monaghan 2-09 to Kerry's 1-12. Kerry won the replay on a 2-09 to 0-10 score. That National football league title of 1985 was won by Monaghan on a 1-11 to 0-09 score against pre-match favourites Armagh. The game was effectively settled by an Eamon McEneaney penalty in the first half when referee John Gough from Antrim decided that an Armagh defender had taken too many steps in his own penalty area. Armagh got to within a point in the second half but a flurry of exceptional long range points from Bernie Murray, Eamon McEneaney and Ray McCarron brought the trophy to Monaghan for the first time. That year's Ulster Senior Football Championship was also a stirring success. An easy first round victory over Donegal in Castleblayney, marked by a spectacular Eamon Murphy goal, followed by a lucky draw against Armagh in the semi-final and one-point victory in the replay saw Monaghan meet Derry in the Ulster Senior Football Championship final. The first day against Armagh, Monaghan relied on pure luck to survive for a draw, as Armagh dominated the game from start to finish, doing everything but score. Paddy Linden saved a penalty, while and Armagh player saw the line barely 30 seconds after coming onto the field as a substitute, following an apparent high tackle on Declan Flanagan. The replay was a better match but a late Armagh goal had Monaghan concerned. However they won by 1-11 to 2-07. In the Ulster final against Derry Eamon McEneaney helped himself to 2-04 as Monaghan recorded and easy 2-09 to 0-08 win. As stated the drawn All-Ireland semi-final against Kerry was a thriller but the absence of David Byrne through injury in the second half probably cost Monaghan victory. Eamon McEneaney's last gasp equaliser was something special but in the replay Kerry were ruthless and despite serious Monaghan pressure the Kingdom won by 5 points. Monaghan's run that year was something special considering the fact that they were missing Declan Loughman, Gerry Hoey and Bernie Murray (all with broken legs). All three were prominent in the National Football League win over Armagh while they would form the spine of the Ulster Senior Football Championship winning side of 1988. Monaghan reached the 1986 National Football League final but this time the opposition was Laois. Played in front of over 30,000 supporters the Laoismen edged out Monaghan by 2-06 to 2-05. Monaghan's championship run in 1986 consisted of a draw against Down in Castleblayney thanks to a last gap Eamon McEneaney free while in the replay Down emerged victors in Newcastle on a 2-11 to 0-11 score. A promising season was over before it had begun. In 1987, Monaghan reached the National Football League semi-final again where they played out a thrilling game against Kerry at Croke Park. A superb second half performance against the wind had Monaghan leading by a couple of points near the end but a Pat Spillane goal and a late point by Mikey Sheehy saw the Kingdom win by 2-11 to 2-09. Monaghan's goals came from Mick O'Dowd and Hugo Clerkin. Disappointment followed in the Ulster championship with a shock 0-14 to 0-12 loss to Cavan in Breffni Park. The early promise of 1985 looked over as two successive seasons of flattering to deceive left the county in a state of gloom. In 1988, the team reached the National Football League semi-final again but ended in a 4-12 to 1-08 drubbing from Dublin at Croke Park. However a good league run prior to that had rescued a season where relegation to Division 2 of the National Football League looked a distinct possibility. A change in management during that league run also added to the merit of the achievement. The 1988 All Ireland semi-final against Cork was even less memorable. Monaghan were holding out against a gale-force wind in the first half and were 0-08 to 0-01 behind at the break. Goalkeeper Paddy Linden had saved a penalty from Larry Tompkins. Two early second half points brought Monaghan to within 5 points. A highly controversial goal following an apparent foul on Monaghan's Brendan Murray rocked the Monaghan revival and Cork took over. Linden's display in that match was a significant factor in him being the first Ulster goalkeeper to receive an All-star award that year. As stated the game was decided when Cork scored a dubious goal and the All-Ireland dream died again. With that defeat, the successful team of the mid 80s started to break up. However 1988 will be remembered for the Ulster title win over Tyrone when a \\"Nudie\\" Hughes goal following a fumble by Tyrone keeper Aidan Skelton saw Monaghan win by 1-10 to 0-11. An interesting facet of this particular game was that all Monaghan's scores came from play. Previous wins over Cavan (0-16 to 0-14), again marked by a 5 star performance from Nudie Hughes and Down (1-11 to 0-09) had brought Monaghan to the Ulster final. In 1989 Monaghan scraped home with an 0-08 to 0-05 win against Antrim in Casement Park, Belfast, where the homesters literally kicked the game away. Down ended Monaghan's run in Castleblayney a few weeks later. The 1990s and early part of the 2000s were lean years for the county. Notable wins in that period were championship successes over Donegal in 1995 and defending All-Ireland champions Armagh in 2003. They won the Dr McKenna Cup in 1995 against Derry and in 2003 against Tyrone. Another noticeable effort was a dramatic second half display against Derry in 1992, which saw a 9-point deficit hauled back to earn a draw. Wins were also recorded over Antrim in 1990 and Cavan in 1993 and 1994. After losses to Fermanagh in 1999 and 2000, a win over them was recorded in 2001. The National Football League run of 1998 was also memorable for Monaghan when they surprisingly qualified from a \\"group of death\\" that included Tyrone, Dublin, Kerry, Cavan and Sligo to qualify for the quarter- finals against Down in Croke Park. Behind at one stage early in the second half by 1-05 to 0-02, the Down goal scored by James Mc Cartan, a rousing rally with goals by Darren Swift and Stephen Mc Ginnitty and a spectacular individual point by Peter Duffy saw Monaghan cause a mild surprise with a 2-05 to 1-06 win. The semi final against Derry was less memorable and defeat on a score of 1-12 to 0-08 was the result. The game had a bit of controversy too when a Mark Daly goal was disallowed and a Monaghan player was sent off. It set the tone for a niggly Ulster Senior Football Championship meeting between both sides a few weeks later. Monaghan's Edwin Murphy was sent off on the advice of a linesman but video evidence subsequently cleared him. However it didn't stop Monaghan suffering a heavy defeat on the day to Derry. 1999 was even less memorable at senior level, the big highlight being the county U-21 side winning the Ulster championship with a final success over Donegal thanks to a last gasp super point from Kieran Tavey. The run ended with a 2-10 to 0-08 defeat to eventual champions Westmeath in Croke Park. At minor level there was an upsurge in fortunes with the county U-18 team reaching the Ulster minor league finals in 2000 and 2002 losing to Tyrone on both occasions by a point. The Ulster championship final was reached in 2001 for the first time in 18 years when a splendid effort fell short with a 2-13 to 0-13 defeat again to Tyrone. A missed penalty late on when only 4 points separated the sides was a big blow, however on reflection it was Monaghan's misfortune to meet Tyrone sides that would backbone their senior All-Ireland winning sides of 2003 and 2005. In 2001 the counties Vocational Schools team won the Ulster and All- Ireland championships. 2005 was another memorable year for the county when they contested the Division 2 National Football League final against Meath at Croke Park. However it took a last gasp point from Paul Finlay in the final league game against Longford in Clones to earn a draw and automatic promotion to Division 1 for the first time in 18 years. The league semi final against Derry in Clones was also a thriller from a Monaghan perspective. A goal within 15 seconds of the throw in by Tommy Freeman set Monaghan on their way and despite Rory Woods being sent off Monaghan held out for a 1-13 to 1-11 win. The NFL Division 2 final was a thrilling ding dong battle between two well match sides and was full of top drawer scores. It had the 40,000+ crowd on their feet from start to finish. Fortunes ebbed and flowed between both sides and in injury time Meath looked like holding onto a 2-point victory. However a Paul Finlay free with the last kick of the game (sounds familiar) from 40 yards out was deflected into the Meath net by a Meath player and Monaghan edged out 3-13 to 3-12 winners. This game preceded the National Football League final which saw Armagh overcome Wexford to gain their first league title. This marked Monaghan's first visit to Croke Park in 7 years, that resulting in a 1-12 to 0-08 defeat in a National Football League semi-final to Derry back in 1998. Derry gained revenge in the Ulster Senior Football Championship with a 1-17 to 2-08 win, but \\"back door\\" wins over London, Wexford and Louth brought Monaghan to a last 12 meeting with eventual All- Ireland champions Tyrone in Croke Park. In a very entertaining game the tactic of isolating Tommy Freeman up front caused havoc for Tyrone in the first 25 minutes as they leaked 1-05, the goal a spectacular effort from Freeman. However a shrewd management move from Tyrone resulted in a player being brought back to double mark Freeman and the Farney threat was quashed. On the day Monaghan had no plan \\"B\\" and Tyrone took over. They ran out flattering 2-14 to 1-07 winners in the end, limiting Monaghan to a single point from a free in the second half. All the pre-match hype surrounded the question as to whether or not Tyrone's Ryan McMenamin would be playing, having been suspended following an incident in the Ulster final. He missed the game but later returned for the quarter-final against Dublin. Freeman's exploits in the summer of 2005 brought him an All-star nomination and an \\"Irish News\\" Ulster All star award on the \\"40\\". 2006 saw Monaghan compete in Division 1A of the National Football League but apart from a win over Dublin and a draw with Offaly, there was little else to celebrate despite battling displays against Kerry and Tyrone and relegation followed in the spring. The season ended in the championship qualifiers with a desperately poor display against Wexford resulting in an 0-08 to 0-06 defeat. The Dr McKenna Cup final was also reached early in the year but ended in a heavy defeat by Tyrone. The Ulster championship started with a 0-10 to 0-10 draw against eventual Ulster champions Armagh in rain soaked Clones. Six days later Armagh emerged victorious on a 1-13 to 0-10 score, the main difference between the sides being that Armagh took their chances and Monaghan didn't. Two missed goal opportunities on the day proved costly. A 2-19 to 3-05 win over Wicklow in the qualifiers saw Monaghan meet Wexford in Clones in what was probably the worst game of 2006. The continuous rain and wet conditions didn't help but it was the performance of the referee that grabbed the headlines on the day. Wexford who had Matty Forde controversially on board following an incident against Offaly for which he would be subsequently suspended won out by 0-08 to 0-06 and thus Monaghan's year ended on a dismal note. =2007 season= 2007 saw Monaghan compete in Division 2A of the National Football League. A backroom clean out of trainers and selectors didn't augur well but the introduction of Tyrone native Martin Mc Elkennon to the Oriel set up proved to be a master stroke by Seamus Mc Eneaney for the year ahead. A straight run of seven successive victories in matches away to Roscommon and home to Longford and Carlow and away to Clare and away trips to London and home to Offaly and away to Leitrim were fashioned out of great work ethic and spirit and no little skill. The semi-final match is against Meath. The Ulster Championship saw Monaghan play in the quarter final against the winners of Cavan and Down; who meet in the preliminary round. If successful there they would play the winners of Derry and Antrim in the semi-final. Having avoided the \\"big 2\\" namely Armagh and Tyrone, this was viewed as Monaghan's best chance of reaching an Ulster final for the first time in 19 years. However, in recent seasons they had flattered to deceive and have disappointed their supporters when something big was expected from them. This was a big year for the Farney county. Monaghan reached the Dr McKenna Cup semi-final where they suffered a heavy defeat to Tyrone under floodlights in Kingspan Breffni Park, Cavan on 13 February 2007. They had initially qualified from Section A of the competition as runners up to Armagh. National Football League Division 2A Monaghan enjoyed a fantastic run in the National Football League, winning all their 7 games. The platforms for both successes against Roscommon, Longford and Carlow were excellent first half displays where big scoring returns were racked up. The second half display against Clare was probably the best of the season so far. Next up was an away trip to London which Monaghan easily won by 0-16 to 1-05. The game against Offaly in the penultimate round in Clones could well be called the defining match in the group. As it turned out it was and a last gasp Paul Meegan point in injury time was enough to give Monaghan a 0-13 to 0-12 win, guaranteeing them a semi final place as table toppers and an all important position in the revamped Division 2 in 2008. This was achieved with a game in hand against Leitrim which was scheduled for 15 April and won by Monaghan on a 1-14 to 2-10 score. The league semi-final against Meath was played in Croke Park and it was a disaster for the Farney men as two early Meath goals gave them a cushion that they built a winning platform on. Despite the early concession of 2 goals within the first 3 minutes Monaghan dominated and could have been in front at half time but instead went in 2-04 to 0-05 in arrears. The concession of a third goal early in the second half settled matters and despite a late Monaghan rally Meath emerged winners on a 3-10 to 0-12 score. This game asked more questions than it answered and it was obvious from this game that Monaghan's full back line and team in general needed a major overhaul prior to the Ulster championship meeting against Down in Newry on 10 June. Ulster Senior Football Championship P√°irc Esler in Newry was the venue for Monaghan's first game of the Ulster championship where they faced a Down team who had disposed of Cavan in the preliminary round after a replay. This was the day Ciar√°n Hanratty announced his arrival on the county stage with a 2-goal salvo which inspired Monaghan to a 2-15 to 1-15 success. The defence had tightened up considerably and a couple of late fantastic points by Paul \\"Jap\\" Finlay near the end were other highlights in a resolute display in front of 17,000 vocal onlookers. The semi final against Derry in Casement Park on 24 June was also another triumph for Monaghan as they easily defeated Derry by 0-14 to 1-09. The scoreline doesn't in any reflect Monaghan's superiority on the day as they stuck to a rigid game plan and easily disposed of a fancied Derry side. The news that Paul Finlay wouldn't play any part due to illness proved no handicap to Monaghan and his replacement Rory Woods game a tigerish display on the \\"45\\" bringing much needed bulk and skill to trouble Derry's vaunted defence. The only disappointment on the day was the lack of credit given to the victors as the media seemed to concentrate solely on Derry's poor display when in fact credit should be given to Monaghan for playing them off the green carpet that was Casement Park. The final set for 15 July in the home of Ulster football that is Clones was between Monaghan and Tyrone, ironically the same pairing as 1988 when Monaghan recorded their last Ulster Senior Football Championship success and final appearance. Tyrone were favourites in everyone's eyes for this game but in the Oriel county there was an inner belief that their side could upset the formbook and win a title that seemed so unlikely in January 2007. Sales of Monaghan jerseys, flags and anything white and blue went through the roof as the county lit up in anticipation of a great day out. The question on everyone's lips was whether or not Paul Finlay would be cleared by the medical experts to play some part on a stage he was born to grace. He was awaiting results for a viral infection and up to the throw in no-one apart from the doctors treating him, the team management, players and Finlay's family was sure what the diagnosis was. Monaghan folk crossed their fingers in the hope this talented lad would get his chance to play in an Ulster senior football final- an arena he deserved to be part of. In the end Finlay started the match: a match which Tyrone won by a scoreline of 1-15 to 1-13. However the scoreline doesn't tell the story of a cracking match which at one stage had Monaghan trailing by 8 points. A cracking goal by Philip Jordan after 6 minutes put Tyrone in the driving seat but slowly and surely Monaghan came back to trail by 1-08 to 0-07 at half time. Another strong Tyrone rally at the start of the second half put Tyrone on their way. Monaghan goaled in the 51st minute through Tommy Freeman and a succession of high balls on a beleaguered Tyrone defence saw Monaghan plunder the scores to leave just 3 points in it going into injury time. Monaghan had numerous chances to level the game but they had to settle for an injury time point from converted full back Vincent Corey whose switch from No. 3 to No 14 was the catalyst for the Farney fightback. Alas it was a case of too little too late and Tyrone edged out winners by 2 points. All-Ireland qualifiers It was the qualifiers next and Monaghan were drawn against Donegal in Healy Park in Omagh. This was probably Monaghan's finest display of the year as they won against the National League Division One champions by 8 points in a game they controlled from start to finish. Superb displays by Dessie Mone, Eoin Lennon, Tommy Freeman and man of the match Vincent Corey were chief factors in a 2-12 to 1-07 win which saw the Donegal manager retire afterwards but in August 2007 it appeared as if he may rescind that decision according to newspaper reports. Donegal on the night had simply no answer to Monaghan's power, passion, poise and frightening will to win as the T√≠r Chonnail men reverted to type and fell away long before the end. All-Ireland quarter-final The quarter final draws were made as Monaghan entered this arena for the first time since the qualifiers were started. They were drawn against Kerry and Croke Park was named as the venue as part of a triple header involving a minor hurling semi final involving Tipperary and Kilkenny and a senior hurling semi-final involving Waterford and Limerick. The game was fixed for 12 August 2007, almost 22 years to the day that Eamon Mc Eneaney earned his place in Monaghan folklore for a massive equalising point against the same opposition who were as now defending all-Ireland champions. Monaghan were raging outsiders against the Kingdom where the defending champions were odds on to stroll to a semi final against Dublin. Monaghan started on fire with points from Rory Woods and Tommy Freeman. A 7th-minute penalty was awarded to Monaghan when Ci√°ran Hanratty was dragged down whilst bearing in on the Kerry goals. Tommy Freeman coolly stuck the ball away to give Monaghan a commanding lead in front of 80,000 spellbound spectators. However Kerry fought back to parity at the interval on a 0-08 to 1-05 score. The second half was a thrilling affair and despite the concession of a slack goal Monaghan led by 2 points entering the final 8 minutes. However a combination of panic and inexperience both on the field and on the line told as Kerry fought back to level terms and go a point in front with a minute left. Monaghan strived might and main for an equalising point but a series of missed passes and downright hard luck proved to be their downfall. It ended in heartbreak on a score of Kerry 1-12, Monaghan 1-11. A standing ovation was given by the Monaghan supporters to a team that in the words of their manager had left everything they had on the pitch. They gave their all but just came up short. That ended Monaghan's run of 2007 but in terms of the previous 2 decades what a run it was. The county was buzzing again, everywhere was a sea of blue and white and people were proud of their team once more. Afterwards manager S√©amus McEnaney vowed they would be back again in 2008 and as a unit all Monaghan folk hoped they would be, especially team coach/trainer Martin Mc Elkennon, who brought this group from a bunch of also-rans to a team of great potential. On reflection this game was one that got away as it was there for the taking. The only plus was that it meant we were good enough to have beaten anyone in Ireland but Kerry. It also showed this group of players that they could indeed compete with the best. Kerry though went back home to the south to prepare for a semi-final meeting with Dublin on 26 August which they duly won by 1-15 to 0-16 to qualify for the final against Munster rivals Cork. This turned out to be a complete mismatch as the Kingdom crushed a very weak Rebel side without ever slipping into top gear. The eventual champions were quoted many times in the immediate aftermath that their joust with Monaghan had brought them on in leaps and bounds and steeled them sufficiently for the tests against Dublin and Cork. For Monaghan it was a case of a lot done and more to do. Martin Mc Elkennon had the team in superb shape, a fact that received comments from throughout the country. Hopes were high that he would stay on board for 2008 as he was the key to success. The hopes of the county were realised when Mc Eneaney, Mc Elkennon and Trappe decided to stay on board for 2008 and this was ratified by the county committee in September 2007. The only retiree was kit man Michael Mc Kenna who stepped down for work reasons. A big miss to a solid team. Mc Eneaney promised to freshen things up and raise the bar again for 2008, a year that Monaghan fans are looking forward to with relish. The year finished with Monaghan being awarded 7 Irish News Ulster GAA all-stars but more significantly a Vodafone All-star award for Thomas Freeman at right corner forward. As well as that he was chosen as the Irish News and Ulster GAA writers Ulster Gaelic football player of the year. Manager Seamus Mc Eneaney picked up the Ulster GAA writers personality of the year award as well to end 2007 on a high note. Under 21s The under-21 side also managed by the senior team management reached the Ulster final following emphatic wins against Cavan and Fermanagh respectively. They played Armagh in the final on 14 April and after a good showing they lost out to a late Armagh resurgence on a 1-16 to 1-09 score. The seven-point victory flattered the winners on the day as Monaghan were level with minutes to go. =2013 Ulster Senior Football Championship= In the 2013 championship, Monaghan were handed a \\"favorable\\" draw. They were drawn against Antrim in the first round in Casement Park, Belfast. Monaghan had previously brushed aside the Antrim men in the National League. Monaghan started shakily and took a while to get going. They survived some scares but the free taking of Conor McManus powered them over the line 0-11 to 0-6. In the Ulster semi final Monaghan were pitted against local neighbours Cavan. The game was a tight affair with both teams trading scores tit for tat. In the end it finished on a score of 1-11 to 0-13. Coming into the final Monaghan faced the reigning Ulster and All Ireland Champions, Donegal. Nobody had given Monaghan a hope coming into the final but the Farney men took the Tir Chonaill boys by surprise rushing into a 4-0 lead while also keeping Donegal scoreless for 32 minutes. Drew Wylie and Colin Walshe were outstanding marking Colm McFadden and Paddy Mcbrearty respectively. At half time Monaghan led 05-02. Despite the 3 point advantage Donegal were still much fancied but Kieran Hughes stuck over 3 quick points in succession to buffer the Farney Men's advantage. With Vinny Corey's rough housing of Michael Murphy, Donegal failed to get going. Monaghan beat Donegal at their own game using the blanket defence system while Darren Hughes and Conor McManus remained outstanding. It was tight up until the last 10 minutes when Monaghan added some scores to put a gloss on the scoreline. Tommy Freeman one of the greatest servants of Monaghan coming off the bench and firing over the last point. At the end of the game Monaghan had won their first Ulster Senior Football Championship in 25 years. This result was coupled with the Minors superb comeback win earlier in the day defeating Tyrone to complete an historic double. Owen Lennon lifted the Anglo Celt Cup as no Monaghan Captain had done for 25 years.

While commanding the II Varcianorum Italus distinguished himself -- most likely campaigning against the Bructeri in the years 77-78 -- and was awarded dona militaria by the emperor Vespasian, receiving one corona aurea and one hasta pura.Valerie Maxfield, \\"The Dona Militaria of the Roman Army\\" (Durham theses: Durham University, 1972), pp. 86-88 This was followed by a commission as tribunus angusticlavius with Legio VI Victrix stationed at the time in Hispania Tarraconensis. Italus concluded his military career as praefect of the Ala I Flavia Singularium, a unit comprising 1000 horsemen. Italus then began his next part, advancing up the civil ranks of the equestrian order. His first appointment was as procurator of Hellespontus, a district in the Senatorial province of Bithynia et Pontus. At some later point he was appointed procurator in the adjacent Senatorial province of Asia. While Italus held this appointment, \\"a mysterious individual came forward claiming to be Nero\\" (to use Suetonius's wordsThe Twelve Caesars, \\"Nero\\", 57.2) appeared in Asia. Even twenty years after his death, the name of the last Julio-Claudian emperor could rally supporters, and Domitian expected the governor of the province, the proconsul Gaius Vettulenus Civica Cerealis, to handle the threat. Instead, according to Brian Jones, Civica ignored the pretender, possibly fearing \\"that intervention might exacerbate the situation, involve war with Parthia and prejudice the successful conclusion of the Dacian campaign.\\"Jones, \\"C. Vettulenus Civica Cerialis and the False Nero of AD 88\\", Athenaeum, 61 (1983), p. 520 Domitian had Civica murdered and ordered Italus to replace him as governor. In reward for his loyalty, Italus was afterwards promoted to procurator ducenarus of the Lactorates, located in the provinces of Gallia Lugdunensis and Aquitaine. His mission was probably to manage the production of imperial goods of these subject peoples. Despite the death of Domitian, Italus was still favored, and this initiated the third or final part of his career. Under Trajan he was appointed Praefectus annonae, or the person in charge of the public dole of bread to the inhabitants of Rome; he is assumed to have held this post between 95 and 100. His next recorded appointment was as governor of Roman Egypt; his tenure in this office has been dated from 100 to 103.Guido Bastianini, \\"Lista dei prefetti d'Egitto dal 30a al 299p\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 17 (1975), p. 279 His primary concern as governor was to safeguard the harvest and delivery of grain to the populace of Rome, but surviving letters from his administration show his responsibilities extended further. One, written in Latin and dated 19 February 103, concerns 6 recruits to be added to the ranks of a cohort commanded by one Celsianus.Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1022; English translation in A. S. Hunt and C.C. Edgar, Select Papyri, II. Non-literary Papyri. Public Documents (London: Loeb, 1932), pp. 572-575 A second, written in Greek and dated to 19 May 103, concerns the ruinous state of records office for the Arsinoite nome, and orders the strategi of the nome to build a new one at a cost of 3,282 drachmae.S.B. 7378,1; English translation in Hunt and Edgar, Select Papyri, II, pp. 574-577 His life after the year 105, the year the statue was erected by order of the municipal senate, is unknown, as well as whether he married and if so had any children.

In the 1990s, Sligo opted for predominantly white shirts with black shorts with exceptions in 1995 and 1996 when they wore an all-black strip. In 2001, Sligo was fined by the GAA for not wearing their registered county colours and after a win over Kildare decided to make the all-black kit their first choice. Sligo's crest features Benbulbin in the background, one of the iconic landmarks of County Sligo. =Kit evolution= History Due to its much smaller population than both County Galway and County Mayo, the two dominant forces in the province of Connacht, and competition from professional League of Ireland soccer team Sligo Rovers in the county's capital town. The Sligo county football team have never been able to break free of the shackles inherent in the provincial championship format. They have won only three Connacht championships, with about 50 years between each win. These championships came in 1928, 1975 and 2007. Sligo have never appeared in an All-Ireland final. The 1922 Championship is the closest they have come, defeating Roscommon, Mayo and Galway to win the Connacht title, and beating Tipperary in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final that followed. However an objection from Galway on what is described as \\"a flimsy technicality\\" led to the Connacht decider being brought to a replay, which Sligo went on to lose. Sligo met the same fate in the inaugural National Football League campaign of 1926, beating Laois to reach the final, only for Laois to object on the grounds of a Sligo player's name being misspelled; Sligo lost the replay. This gives Sligo the unique position of having qualified for an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final and a National Football League Final, without ever having contested either. In 1954, Sligo reached the Connacht final against Galway, only for an equalising goal in the final minute to be disallowed. In 1962, Sligo reached the Connacht final against Roscommon, and led for much of the match only to be blighted by a sudden string of injuries, miss a 50 while two points ahead in the final minute, and then gift soon-to-be All-Ireland finalists Roscommon a goal in what is considered \\"one of the great football tragedies in Connacht\\". In 1965, Sligo reached the Connacht final against Galway and gained a seven-point lead, only for one of their players to be \\"mysteriously sent to the full-forward spot\\", causing \\"the entire team [to lose] momentum\\" and the match. Since the 2001 introduction to the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship of a qualifier system for teams eliminated from their provincial championship, Sligo, despite historically having a poor record, has enjoyed some modest, though noteworthy, success. The new format together with a prolonged period of competing in Division 1 of the National Football League helped bring about an upward turn in the county's fortunes. In 2002, having narrowly lost the Connacht Senior Football Final to Galway, the defending All-Ireland champions, Sligo went on to defeat Tyrone in Croke Park, turning over a seven-point deficit in the process. A similar comeback against the eventual All-Ireland champions Armagh two weeks later led to a replay, but Sligo's run was halted when they had claims for a penalty in injury time of the second game turned down. On 8 July 2007, Sligo claimed their first Connacht title since 1975 with a one-point victory over Galway. The following year they were trashed by Mayo and ended up in the Tommy Murphy Cup, after a league campaign that had seen them relegated to Division 4. Star player Eamonn O'Hara said he was embarrassed by the team's rapid decline back into mediocrity. On 27 June 2010, Sligo hosted Galway and led 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì2 at halftime but were shocked by an undeserved draw ending 1‚Äì10 each. The replay saw Sligo defeat the Tribesmen on the scoreline 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì16 to advance to the Connacht Senior Football Final. Once there, after all their hard work and continued misfortune, Roscommon defeated them by 0‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì13. Sligo football descended to a new depth on 26 May 2013 when they were dumped out of the Connacht Championship by London in their first game. The scoreline was 1-12 to 0-14. This was London's first victory in the Connacht Championship since 1977. Lorcan Mulvey scored the vital London goal. The county Vocational Schools team reached two All-Ireland finals in 1962 and 1963, losing both to Dublin City.

Westmeath's home ground is Cusack Park, Mullingar. The team's manager is Jack Cooney. The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 2004, but has never won the All-Ireland Senior Championship or the National League. History Westmeath's history is that of a minor county which only recently rose to the higher ranks of football. Its 2004 Leinster provincial title was presaged by a 1995 All-Ireland Minor title and victory in the 1999 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship. Another generation of Westmeath players took part in the first week-night fixture in the GAA championship: on 20 June 1935 they played Meath in Kells and lost by 2-7 to 0-9. The footballers won the 1929 junior championship, lost to Dublin by ten points in 1960 and then defeated Dublin to reach the 1931 Leinster final. They defeated Carlow, Laois and Offaly to go into a 1949 final against Meath, but were well beaten on both occasions. Twenty years later they reached the National Football League semi- final. Westmeath defeated Dublin again in the 1967 Championship and the 1984 Centenary Cup campaign and qualified for their second League semi-final in 1994. In 2001, the team went on an All-Ireland journey through an unprecedented nine games including an extra-time win over Mayo in Roscommon. Notable players in this campaign were Ger Heavin, Dessie Dolan, Rory O'Connell, Damien Healy and David Mitchell, with other players to star occasionally, including Martin Flanaghan, Fergal Wilson, Paul Conway, David O'Shaughnessy and Fergal Murray. Westmeath lost out to Meath in a quarter- final replay. Disappointing 2002 and 2003 seasons followed and Westmeath parted terms with its then manager, Luke Dempsey. Kerry footballing legend P√°id√≠ √ì S√© was brought in to manage the senior team some months later, after he had been removed from the Kerry Senior team management. The following year, Westmeath progressed to the 2004 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final and won their first ever Leinster senior football title with a replayed victory over Laois (having previously beaten Wexford, Dublin and Offaly). However the team tamely exited their second All-Ireland Quarter Final - losing to Derry. The documentary Marooned followed Westmeath during their 2004 season. √ì S√© quit Westmeath at the end of a very poor 2005 season and was replaced by his assistant Tom√°s √ì Flatharta. After a poor league campaign, in which they were nevertheless promoted from Division 2, the team was knocked out of the Leinster Senior Football Championship in the first round by Offaly. However wins over London, Limerick, Sligo and then a historic defeat of Galway in Pearse Park in Salthill set up a third All-Ireland Quarter Final for the team in six years - this time against Dublin. Westmeath did not live up to expectations in the Quarter Final meeting against Dublin and lost by 10 points. Westmeath staged a strong second half display to capture the 2008 Division 2 National Football League title for the third time, and the first since 2003 following a five-point win over Dublin at P√°irc Tailteann, Navan. The score line was Westmeath 0-15, Dublin 0-10.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Leinster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Wexford's home ground is Wexford Park, Wexford. The team's manager is Paul Galvin. The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 1945, the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 1918 and has never won the National League. History Wexford had one of the greatest football teams in the history of the GAA in the 1910s, winning six consecutive Leinster titles and the first team to win four All-Ireland titles in a row.Wexford Four in a Row The team was trained by 1900 star James 'the Bull' Roche, who had fought for the World heavyweight boxing championship. The team featured Fr Ned Wheeler, Aidan Doyle and the O'Kennedy brothers, Gus and Sean. The latter was the team captain. The feat of six Leinster titles in a row was only equalled in 1931 when Kildare won the sixth in a sequence that began in 1926. Wexford's last major football success was winning the Leinster title in 1945. From then on, hurling took precedence in Wexford and as a consequence the Wexford footballers suffered, with the team descending into obscurity for many years. More recently, Wexford have had a strong team. The team reached the Division 1 League final of 2005 under the management of Pat Roe but were beaten by a strong Armagh team that day. In April 2008, in Jason Ryan's first year as manager of the team, Wexford beat Fermanagh to win the Division 3 League final. This proved to be the first success of what would be a historic year for Wexford football, as they reached their first Leinster final in over 50 years. Along the way they stunned Meath by coming from ten points down to win their quarter-final in Carlow, and then beat Laois comprehensively in the semi-final. This was Wexford's 5th consecutive appearance in the provincial semi-final, but their first victory. In the final they were comprehensively beaten by a strong Dublin team, 3‚Äì23 to 0‚Äì09. However, Wexford recovered from their humiliation and came through the back door, beating Down by seven points in a shock result to reach the last eight and a match-up with Armagh. From here, they produced one of the shocks of the championship, winning by 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì12 to reach their first All Ireland semi-final since 1945. They were beaten by 6 points by Tyrone, having been within two points of the eventual champions in the closing stages. Wexford again reached the Leinster final in the 2011 Leinster Championship. Wexford had an easier run to the final than in 2008, facing Offaly, Westmeath and Carlow. In the final they faced Dublin again, but ran them much closer. A poor performance from Dublin's star player Bernard Brogan helped Wexford stay in touch with Dublin throughout the match, but a bizarre own goal meant they ultimately lost by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì12, to the team that went on to win the All- Ireland. Wexford entered Round 4 of the qualifiers where they faced Limerick, but they were beaten by a single point, on a score of 1‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì17.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Leinster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Wicklow's home ground is Aughrim County Ground. The team's manager is Davy Burke. The team has never won the Leinster Senior Championship, the All-Ireland Senior Championship or the National League. History Wicklow are one of two counties never to have won a senior provincial championship (the other is Fermanagh), but Bray Emmets, the leading side of the early 1900s, won Leinster and All-Ireland honours when they were playing in the Dublin Championship. Wicklow were twice proclaimed Leinster champions for short periods. Bray were representing Wicklow in 1889, and when they beat Newtown Blues of Drogheda by 1-7 to 1-4 they claimed that they had won the \\"final of Leinster\\" because Queens County or Kilkenny had not shown up for a final. But four days later the result was quashed. In 1897 they became Leinster champions for a week. A downpour caused Dublin to presume the Leinster final would not be played, Dublin went home, the referee awarded a walk-over to Wicklow. But the following meeting of the Central Council ordered the match to be replayed and Wicklow lost by 1-9 to 0-3. A League semi-final in frostbound 1947 came about in bizarre fashion: Wicklow were picked to represent an unfinished group in which some of the teams had not yet played. In 1954 Wicklow were leading Meath by two points after sixty minutes of play but Meath were saved by the clock. Nine minutes of lost time had elapsed before Meath scored the winning point! After surviving the \\"long count\\" Meath went on to win the All-Ireland, and Wicklow lost their best player of the decade, John Timmons, to Dublin. In 1986 they pulled off a huge upset beating newly crowned League champions Laois in the Leinster Quarter-final on a scorching hot June day in Aughrim by 2-10 to 1-9, Wicklow legend Kevin O'Brien scored 2-3 in that game. However, they were no match for Meath, who knocked them out in the Leinster semi-final. A near thing against Meath, just off their four-match with Dublin in 1991 (Wicklow drew 0-12 to 1-9 and lost the replay by three points) heralded a great start to the 1990s. But Wicklow's only championship wins since were against Longford and Westmeath, and a 1996 League quarter-final appearance against Donegal their nearest to a breakthrough. Lying in wait for complacent opponents, particularly in Aughrim, for unsuspecting opposition has been the Wicklow trademark since. Exploits included a 1986 win over newly crowned League champions Laois at Aughrim, and a 1981 defeat by just two points against Dublin in the Leinster quarter-final, after a miracle save in the last minute by Dublin's goalkeeper John O'Leary. =Since 2000= The early part of the 00s were very lean for Wicklow, with them winning very few championship matches however they did produce a number of competitive results and were unfortunate in several games. Under the management of Hugh Kenny Wicklow lined out against Meath in the opening round of the 2004 Leinster Championship. They were playing exceptionally well and were leading Meath by 1-6 to 0-7 early in the second half when midfielder Ciaran Clancy was harshly sent off. This seemed to knock the stuffing out of Wicklow who never recovered and were hammered 2-13 to 1-8, Derry then knocked Wicklow out of the championship in the Qualifiers by 1-15 to 1-10. Against Kildare in the opening round of the 2005 Leinster Championship they came very close to a first win leading Kildare but unfortunately for Wicklow, the age old problem of not being able to close out a game surfaced, and they were ultimately beaten by 1-17 to 2-12, Donegal then knocked Wicklow out of the Qualifiers beating them by 0-16 to 0-12. =Under Mick O'Dwyer= In October 2006, legendary former Kerry manager and player Mick O'Dwyer took over as Wicklow manager. During his tenure Wicklow's championship results improved, while Wicklow had shown promise in 2004 and 2005, they suffered two heavy defeats in the 2006 championship. In 2007 under Mick O'Dwyer they played Louth in the first round of the Leinster Championship, taking Louth to two replays before finally being beaten; however, later that year, they went on to win the Tommy Murphy Cup, defeating Antrim in dramatic fashion with a late Tommy Gill goal in extra-time,\\"Wicklow 3-13 Antrim 1-17 (AET)\\". RT√â Sport. 4 August 2007. securing the Wicklow senior footballers a second ever national trophy, and first ever win in Croke Park. As Wicklow were a Division 4 team they were not permitted to enter the 2007 backdoor. Going into the 2008 championship, Wicklow had not won a championship game since beating London on June 8, 2002 and had not won a Leinster Championship 1st round proper game since beating Longford by 1 point in 1996 (they won a Leinster group game in 2000, but this was the only year under that format). They faced a heavily fancied Kildare in the 1st round and completed arguably their greatest ever championship win beating Kildare 0-13 to 0-9, this was also their first ever championship win in Croke Park, they went on to lose narrowly to Laois in the Quarter-Final. Again as they were a Division 4 team they were not permitted to enter the qualifiers, so they went on to try and defend the Tommy Murphy Cup but ultimately lost to Antrim in the final. The 2009 Championship was one of the most memorable in Wicklow's history, they won their Leinster 1st-round game against Longford by 2-12 to 1-13 before narrowly losing to Westmeath in the next round by 0-16 to 1-10. Division 4 teams were allowed to enter the Qualifiers again by 2009 and so Wicklow began their campaign by beating Fermanagh 0-17 to 1-11 in the 1st round, they then comfortably beat Cavan by 1-12 to 0-8 in the 2nd round, they dramatically beat Down by 1-15 to 0-17 thanks to a late 45' that was scored by Tony Hannon before their famous run finally came to an end when Kildare beat them by 1-16 to 2-9 in the last round of the Qualifiers. In 2010, Wicklow beat Carlow in the 1st round of the Leinster championship but again narrowly lost out in the Quarter-final, this time to Westmeath by a single point, 0-15 to 1-11 but unfortunately they were unable to repeat their historic 2009 Qualifier run losing out to Cavan in the 1st round, agonisingly by a single point again, 0-15 to 2-8. Wicklow's 2011 Leinster campaign started poorly with a 0-12 to 0-5 1st round defeat by Kildare; however, they bounced back well, defeating Sligo by 1-18 to 0-16 in the 1st round of the Qualifiers, in the 2nd round they drew with Armagh 0-19 to 2-13 before losing the replay at home by 2-9 to 0-10.

History  The style was born in New York dance parties named GHE20G0TH1K, which started in 2009. These parties featured voguers, punks, and fashionista,, took place in warehouses across Brooklyn and Manhattan and started to radicalize the city's nightclub scene within a year. The style that defined the deconstructed club movement was directly shaped by the possibilities of CDJs, and DJ sets, in turn, have inspired producers to imitate this chaotic experimentation in their own music, creating feedback that continued to re-imagine the expectations of the dance-floor music. The MP3s used by DJs on GHE20G0TH1K had a crunchy, cruddy texture while being played on a big sound system, which came to define their aesthetic. Each member of the collective came from a different background, but they incorporated those differences into the mix, hybridizing a melange of Jersey club, Baltimore, Footwork, Grime, Ballroom, and Punk music, as well as elements of House and Techno. Because of Deconstructed club's relationship to vogue and prominent LGBTQ originators, the genre's identity is tied to the underground party scene in NYC and alternative queer nightlife. Artists from the labels Fade to Mind, and Keysound, that mixed together rebooted ballroom/vogue house, jersey club, and the new wave of instrumental grime, all with a stark, hi-tech machine sheen are also cited as pioneers of the genre. The term itself started circulating in the mid-2010s and was used as an umbrella term to describe a disparate, international genus of producers pushing the limits or boundaries of club music and turning it avant-garde.  Characteristics  The genre steps away from traditional and mainstream dance music tropes, such as four on the floor beats, stable tempos, build-ups, and drops. Instead, it is identified by an aggressive, frantic, post-industrial sound design, featuring metallic or staccato sounds such as samples of glass smashing, gunshots, etc., deconstructed club aims for an excessive, apocalyptic-sounding soundscape, with constant rhythmic switch-ups and atonality. Deconstructed club proposes a chaotic mix and a sonic canvas where ballroom samples, field recordings, a cappella rapping and industrial soundscapes are adjusted into dance-floor music. The genre is characterized by its disruptive elements and a wide dynamic tempo range, often utilizing jersey club kick-patterns, grime claps, and jittery footwork production to create a sensation of frenetic high-BPM tracks; in addition, tracks delve into experimental soundscapes and alternating atmospheric breathers. The genre's ethos and ideas are decidedly post-structuralist towards conventional music production and dance music.  Visual art  The music, often accompanied by music videos, resembles visual art. Some of the artists, such as Matthew Barney, studied visual arts rather than music. The visuals are often abstract and despicable mutational grotesque, decomposing forms. This crossing between the visuals and experimental electronic music has become such a thing that one of the key labels in the genre PAN has launched an imprint, \\"Entopia\\", dedicated to producing soundtracks for art installations, films, theater works, dance, and fashion podiums. Reception The music journalist and critic Simon Reynolds called the style conceptronica and said that \\"it isn't a genre as such, but more like a mode of artistic operation\\". He compared the genre with 1990s IDM, saying that the pioneers of the early IDM, such as Aphex Twin or Luke Vibert produced their music with juvenile humor, creating a chilly background for unthinking daydreaming rather than intellectual thoughts of the latter. But genres are rather connected by their background, while IDM was a commentary on the last days of the club and rave trends, the deconstructed club is also able to work over the dance music history, e.g. Berlin duo Amnesia Scanner gleaned inspiration from the Euro-techno sound known as hardstyle, Stine Janvin did loose homage to the 90s rave trends completely based on manipulating the sound through her voice, while Venezuelan producer Arca drastically decimate hedonistic rap and R&B; in her early track \\"Doep\\".

He was a prolific translator from Syriac into Arabic and also wrote original works of philosophy, ethics, theology, medicine and meteorology. Ibn al-KhammƒÅr has an entry in the biographical dictionary of Ibn Abƒ´ U·π£aybi øa. He was born in November or December 942 (c. AH 330) in Baghdad. He became a surgeon at the  øA·∏çudƒ´ hospital in Baghdad, where he taught Ibn al- ·π¨ayyib and Ibn Hind≈´. According to ·∫íahƒ´r al-Dƒ´n al-Bayhaqƒ´, writing over a century later, Ibn al-KhammƒÅr spent his last years in KhwƒÅrizm and Ghazna, where he converted to Islam. His death can be dated in or after 1017. The manuscript Arabe 2346 in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France contains an Arabic translation of Aristotle's Organon copied from a copy made by Ibn al- KhammƒÅr, itself copied from a copy made by his teacher, Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn  øAdƒ´. Arabe 2346 contains various scholia on the Organon by the philosophers of Baghdad, including some by Ibn al-KhammƒÅr. In the debates between the mutakallim≈´n (Islamic theologians) and the falƒÅsifa (Islamic philosophers) concerning whether God was known by intuition or by inferential reasoning, Ibn al-KhammƒÅr took the side of the falƒÅsifa. Most of his works are lost, but the titles of two are known: MaqƒÅla fƒ´ l-taw·∏•ƒ´d wa-l-tathlƒ´th (Treatise on the Unity and Trinity) and KitƒÅb al-tawfƒ´q bayna arƒÅ æ al-falƒÅsifa wa-l-Na·π£ƒÅra (The Concordance of the Views of the Philosophers and the Christians). Nothing is known about them beyond what can be inferred from their titles. Ibn al-KhammƒÅr translated from Syriac into Arabic the Categories, On Interpretation and Prior Analytics of Aristotle; the Isagoge and two books of the History of Philosophy of Porphyry; the Meteorological Phenomena of Theophrastus; and the Book of Allƒ´n≈´s. His translations were praised by al-Taw·∏•ƒ´dƒ´ for their elegance. Ibn al-KhammƒÅr was revered by his contemporaries. Ibn al-Nadƒ´m, who knew him, praises him as a logician.  øAlƒ´ ibn Ri·∏çwƒÅn, the Egyptian physician, recorded that Sultan Ma·∏•m≈´d of Ghazna kissed the ground before him out of respect. His fame was such that the philosopher Avicenna expressed an intention to meet him, which ultimately went unfulfilled.

History and origins  The Banu Awd are descendants of Awd ibn Sa'd al-'Ashirah ibn Madh'hij. A Qahtanite tribe that mostly settled in Yemen in the pre-Islamic period. Awd is recorded to have two sons: Munabbah and Ka'b. Although Arabic history books scarcely mention Banu Awd, they are recorded in most of the Arabic genealogist works. Banu Awd is recorded to have participated in the Battle of Siffin on the side of Ali's army. A man from Banu Awd named 'Amr ibn Aws was among the captives from the battle. They were delivered to Muawiya I to determine their fate. General Amr ibn al-'As suggested to the caliph to kill all them, the captive Amr ibn Aws interrupted and said to Muawiya: \\"You are my maternal uncle so do not kill me\\" The Banu Awd came from Kufa and Syria to ask the caliph to release their fellow tribesman. Muawiya then asserted that if the man was telling the truth and that he was indeed this man's uncle he would release him without the need for the tribe to intervene. Amr ibn Aws proceeded to explain to the caliph that he is the son of Umm Habibah Muawiya's sister and the wife of the Prophet (The wives of the prophet were given the honorific title Mother of the Believers) Muawiya, astonished at the man's words said: \\"Among these there is nobody who would have thought of it other than he!

Biography  Dunkle was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and grew up in Indiana, United States. He attended the University of Kansas and Harvard University. At Harvard, he studied under Alfred Romer and obtained his PhD in 1939. Afterward, he worked at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH), where he studied and published papers about arthrodires from the Cleveland area. He also led two trips to the west to bolster the museum's collection of fossils in the 1940s. A notable object he collected for the museum was CMNH 7541, a dinosaur skull upon which the controversial Nanotyrannus genus is based on. After Dunkle collected the skull in 1942, Charles W. Gilmore described the genus in 1946, classifying it as a new species in the tyrannosaur genus Gorgosaurus. Dunkle left the CMNH in 1946 to work as a vertebrate paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History, although he continued working with the CMNH and returned in the 1960s to advise the museum on an operation salvaging fossils from Interstate 71. He left the National Museum in March 1968, and worked at the CMNH until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Virginia. He died in Tappahannock on January 3, 1984.  Legacy  Juvenile Dunkleosteus terrelli skull, Cleveland Museum of Natural History Through his lifetime, Dunkle published around fifty papers that mostly deal with the fossils of fish.

He worked for the United States Department of Agriculture from the 1920s to the 1970s. Early life and education Waugh was the brother of Albert Waugh, long-time provost at the University of Connecticut, and the son of Frank Albert Waugh, who was a professor of horticulture and landscape architecture at the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst) and the namesake of the Frank A. Waugh Arboretum at the university. He enlisted in the United States Army Ambulance Service for World War I, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his service. After the war, he graduated from the Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1922. He earned a master's degree in 1924 from Rutgers University, became an instructor at the University of Connecticut in 1925, and completed a Ph.D. in 1929 at Columbia University. Recognition Waugh is one of the namesakes of the Frisch‚ÄìWaugh‚ÄìLovell theorem in econometrics. He became a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 1945, and a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 1947. In 1957, the Agricultural & Applied Economics Association named him as a fellow. In 1968, he and his daughter, mathematician Margaret Maxfield, won the Lester R. Ford Award of the Mathematical Association of America for a paper on the rational approximation of square roots.

Early life and education  Adrian Gerard Barnett was born in Northampton, England in January 1973. He was awarded a first class honours B.Sc. in statistics from the University College London in 1994. On graduating from UCL he worked as a statistician for SmithKline Beecham and for the Medical Research Council (of Great Britain) before moving to Australia to study for his Ph.D in mathematics. He was awarded a Ph.D in 2002 by the University of Queensland.  Career  Barnett is committed to open research and concerned to make medical science more reproducible and less wasteful and, together with colleagues, lodges prospective study protocols on F1000Research where they can be critiqued by the worldwide community. In part, as a result of this commitment, he collaborates with scientists from New Zealand, from China, from the US, as well as from Australia. He has published articles on environmental health, in particular, on the effects of high temperatures on work related injuries, on death rates, on other temperature-related health issues, and on the statistical methods for the analysis of such data. Much of his work has been towards improving hospitals. Air pollution and its effects on health is another area to which he and his colleagues have made many contributions. His work on public health has meant that he enters the public arena in order to bring scientific knowledge into the public debate. Thus at the time of the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire in the Latrobe Valley, Barnett publicly criticised the handling of the fire, arguing that at least 11 additional deaths resulted from the long-burning fire and its toxic smoke. He served as an expert witness in the inquiry which followed. Barnett has criticised air quality standards in Australia as giving apparently safe cut- offs for air pollution concentrations whereas his and others' work shows that there are no safe levels for air pollutants, and thus the \\"standards\\" increase the health risks to all Australians. He has used The Conversation to further discuss issues concerning the toxicity of air pollution.

The street stretches from the Willamette River on the west, (although it continues over the river via the Hawthorne Bridge and becomes Madison Street through Downtown Portland), and 92nd Avenue on the east. Mount Tabor blocks the street between 60th Street and 72nd Avenue. Hawthorne Boulevard is a principal street west of 50th Avenue and a residential street to the east. The most famous portion of Hawthorne Boulevard is between 29th Avenue and Cesar Chavez Boulevard (formerly 39th Avenue) which serves as a cultural hot spot for Portland's hippie movement. This section of the street is filled with local businesses, boutiques, restaurants, and gift stores, as well as the first Fred Meyer grocery at 36th and Hawthorne, and a bakery at 12th and Hawthorne. It the grocery closed in the 1930s. Hawthorne Boulevard is often compared to Haight Street in San Francisco due to the similar culture of both streets. The street is named for Doctor James C. Hawthorne, a politician and physician. Dr. Hawthorne donated land for the Oregon Hospital for the Insane near the modern day Colonel Summers Park in 1862. The Hospital for the Insane is often called the Hawthorne Asylum, and the street, originally named U Street, took on the moniker Asylum Avenue. The Asylum closed in 1883, and an ordinance was passed to rename the street to Hawthorne Avenue in 1888. Anticipation of growth and connection by the Morrison Bridge occurred in the 1880s, leading to land speculation. The bridge opened in 1887, and served Hawthorne indirectly with a streetcar on Morrison/Belmont in 1887, and then directly by the Mt. Tabor Street Railway steam car in 1888. During the time, the centers of activity were \\"lower Hawthorne\\"'s 34th to 39th Avenues, and 46th to 50th Avenues, called \\"upper Hawthorne\\"; the latter cluster developed where a streetcar line to Foster split off Hawthorne at 50th. The Madison Bridge opened in 1891, and the street was connected to downtown via streetcar. Portland's eastside was annexed into Portland in the same year. The street was \\"completely macadamized\\" (paved) by 1907, and SE 39th Avenue was improved as part of the Good Roads Movement in 1910. These, as well as other factors, led to the demise of the streetcar, and by 1918 Hawthorne was one of the busiest streets for car traffic in Portland. The sidewalks were narrowed to give room to car traffic in 1931, and the streetcar tracks were removed as part of a WPA project in 1936. The streetcar line became a trolleybus in that year, operating as Portland Traction Company. Despite the removal of the lines, mass transit use boomed with the population influx of the 1940s. Portland's last streetcar, which ran on Belmont up to Mt. Tabor, stopped running in 1948. 39th Avenue was widened in 1950, a traffic light was placed at the intersection with Hawthorne, and the modern Fred Meyer superstore opened in 1951. This led to a significant drop in grocers and butchers along the street. Notable buildings on Hawthorne include the Spanish Mission Revival Santa Barbara Apartments, and the similarly-styled Bagdad Theater, built in 1927.

The name suggests the instruments' portability, with battery operation being a consistent feature across the line. Many of these keyboards were designed for children with small keys and simple preset functions suitable for educational use. In 1982 the line introduced a card reader system which allowed players to learn and play along with sequenced songs. The PSS line features mini keys and the PSR line features full size keys. Some of the higher-end keyboards have advanced features like programmable synthesizer controls, midi capability, and sampler functions.  Contemporary use  Electronic musicians and sound engineers have used these instruments to achieve an authentic lo-fi sound and some modify them with circuit bending to extend their sound palettes. As of 2015, musician Dan Friel continues to use a Portasound that he received as a gift in 1984.

The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act or Heroes Act () is proposed legislation acting as a $3 trillion stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to supplement the earlier CARES Act stimulus package. The bill for this Act of Congress was proposed by Representative Nita Lowey of New York on May 12, 2020, and was passed by the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 208‚Äì199 on May 15, 2020.  Stipulations  The Heroes Act includes about $1.13 trillion of emergency supplemental appropriations to federal agencies, as well as economic assistance to governments at the state, local, tribal, and territorial levels. There would be about $485 billion in safety net spending, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, increased funding utilities payments and job training for low-income individuals, and a 25% increase in aid to disabled veterans. There would be about $435 billion for additional rebates, which would include an additional $1200 stimulus check per individual. There would be about $382 billion for health care, which would include reimbursing health care providers for lost revenue, covering the COBRA premium costs for employees laid off between March 2020 and January 2021, increasing funding for testing and contact tracing, eliminating cost-sharing for coronavirus treatment, and increasing funding for health agencies and centers. Employers would also need to implement infectious disease control panels. There would be about $290 billion to support small businesses and employee retention, with modifications to the Paycheck Protection Program. This would expand employee retention credit, provide credits for employer expenses, extend and expand paid leave (such as paid sick days, family and medical leave), and provide a 90% income credit for self-employed individuals. There would be about $290 billion to reduce income taxes and $191 billion for student loan relief and funding for higher education. There would be about $202 billion for housing-related costs and expenses, including the establishment of an emergency rental assistance fund and a homeowner's assistance fund. Some eviction and foreclosure moratoriums would be expanded as well, being extended for up to another year and expanding the moratorium to cover all renters and homeowners rather than specific cases as previously done in the CARES Act. There would be about $190 billion for hazard pay for essential workers. In addition, there would be $32 billion for communication systems (such as the U.S. Postal Service), $48 billion for pensions and retirement relief, $31 billion for agricultural spending, and $254 billion for a limited business loss deductions.  Status  After the bill's passage in the House, Republicans in the Senate called it \\"dead on arrival\\", saying it was \\"unrealistic\\" and a \\"partisan offering\\". Some progressives also threatened to vote against the bill prior to its passage, saying it did not go far enough, and that any payments to citizens needed to be recurring, additional payroll support for businesses needed to be included, business liability protections had to be limited, as well as that any aid to businesses needed to be targeted more at small- and medium-sized enterprises rather than larger corporations. On July 24, 2020 (two months following the passage of the Heroes Act), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he hoped a package could be agreed on \\"in the next few weeks\\", with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying that there was a \\"fundamental agreement\\" on a $1 trillion package, which would include the $1200 stimulus checks, as well payroll tax cuts wanted by some Republicans, and that relief checks would be available by August 2020. On July 27, 2020, McConnell announced the proposal of the Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools (HEALS) Act, a smaller $1 trillion package. The HEALS Act includes increased funding for schools and higher learning institutions, as well as hospitals. The HEALS Act would not provide additional funding for state and local governments short on tax revenue due to shutdowns and business closures, and would also reduce expanded unemployment benefits from $600 per week to $200. After a late-August phone call with Mnuchin, Pelosi said: \\"Sadly, this phone call made clear that Democrats and the White House continue to have serious differences understanding the gravity of the situation that America's working families are facing.\\" She indicated House Democrats were willing to negotiate reducing the House bill's cost to $2.2 trillion.\\" Senator Bernie Sanders admonished McConnell, saying, \\"Do your job.

The area was developed from the 1920s as WhangƒÅrei's port, and in the mid-1960s it was the ninth-busiest port in New Zealand.. It needed more space to handle the increasing size of ships, and Northport was developed at Marsden Point to replace it, with the transition complete in 2007. There has been a suggestion that the Royal New Zealand Navy might establish a base at Port WhangƒÅrei. Demographics The statistical area of Port-Limeburners, which includes a slightly larger area than Port WhangƒÅrei, had a population of 102 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 63 people (161.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 51 people (100.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 36 households. There were 69 males and 30 females, giving a sex ratio of 2.3 males per female. Of the total population, 9 people (8.8%) were aged up to 15 years, 9 (8.8%) were 15 to 29, 66 (64.7%) were 30 to 64, and 18 (17.6%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 64.7% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 26.5% MƒÅori, 2.9% Pacific peoples, 14.7% Asian, and 2.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 35.3, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 58.8% had no religion, 26.5% were Christian, and 14.7% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 12 (12.9%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 15 (16.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $22,800. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 51 (54.8%) people were employed full-time, 6 (6.5%) were part-time, and 3 (3.2%) were unemployed.

Foundation Facade of the former Artists Space Gallery at its original location in Essendon, as seen in 2020. The Gallery occupied the top floor, entered via stair from door left of shop. The gallery was founded in 1978 by Melbourne painter and photographer Wes Placek. He was joined in the early 80's by his partner Sophie Nowicka a textile designer and artist, who assisted in administration of the gallery and in curatorial selection of exhibitions.  Location  When it opened, the gallery occupied the top floor of a 1920s shopfront in the main street at 127 Buckley St., near the railway station in the working-class suburb Essendon. In 1987 the Gallery was relocated, closer to Melbourne CBD and amongst a growing number of other galleries.Cason, J. (1991). The photo gallery & workshop handbook. New York, NY: Images Press. Though it also showed other media, it was among contemporary specialist photography galleries The Photographers' Gallery, Brummels and Church Street that revived the medium as an art form. The new space, with four times the floor area,Beatrice Faust, 'Getting enough space is only half the job,' The Age, Wednesday, 19 Aug 1987, p.14 was in a former warehouse in North Fitzroy at 150 Park Street on the corner of Best Street, opposite a linear park created from the Inner Circle Railway Line which had closed in 1981. Reception A range of exhibitions included emerging artists and those well recognised nationally and internationally. While located in Essendon, in the opinion of The Age newspaper art reviewer Beatrice Faust, Placek's exhibitions \\"accumulated a lot of critical capital,\\" as it \\"showed small collections of consistently good and sometimes excellent work,\\" including Robert Mapplethorpe's 1983 photogravure suite 'Flowers', and also Bettina Rheims. However, in her 1987 review, just after the relocation, Faust feared the extra space would affect the quality of the work shown, though favourable reviews continued. It signifies the impact of the Gallery, that founder Placek was himself included, among many of the past exhibitors at Artists Space, in the landmark survey show and publication of photography of the 1970s and 1980s, The Thousand Mile Stare.

The duo participated in the 2016 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, losing in the first round to the team of Austin Aries and Roderick Strong. The duo returned and had their first televised victory on the March 29 episode of NXT, defeating the team of Mike Marshall and Jonathan Ortagun. = SmackDown (2019‚Äì2020) = Tucker Knight made his first televised main roster appearance at the Greatest Royal Rumble event in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, entering the Royal Rumble match at #24 and eliminating Drew Gulak before being eliminated by Big E. On the December 17 episode of Raw, Heavy Machinery were advertised as two of six NXT wrestlers to be moved to the main roster. With the shortened names of Otis and Tucker, they debuted on the January 14 episode of Raw interrupting an interview between Alexa Bliss and Paul Heyman. On the April 16 episode of SmackDown, the team was moved to the SmackDown brand during the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up. At WrestleMania 35, Otis and Tucker competed in the sixth annual Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, but failed to win. In May, they started a feud with SmackDown Tag Team Champions Daniel Bryan and Erick Rowan. The duo participated at the 51-Man Battle Royal at the 2019 Super ShowDown, but they were both eliminated during the match. After weeks of mind games from the champions, Heavy Machinery faced Bryan and Rowan at Stomping Grounds in a losing effort. On the July 2nd episode of SmackDown, Otis and Tucker defeated Dolph Ziggler and Kevin Owens to become the number one contenders to the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. At Extreme Rules, Heavy Machinery lost to Bryan and Rowan and The New Day. On the September 30 episode of Raw, Heavy Machinery made an appearance via the wild card rule to challenge for the Raw Tag Team Championship, but lost to champions Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode. At Crown Jewel on October 31, Heavy Machinery competed in a tag team turmoil match, but were eliminated by The New Day. At Survivor Series, Heavy Machinery participated in an interbrand tag team battle royal which was won by Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode. By the end of 2019, Otis had entered into a romantic storyline with Mandy Rose. On the February 14, 2020, episode of SmackDown, Otis had a date with Rose but saw Dolph Ziggler sitting at her table, causing Otis to walk away heartbroken. On the March 6 episode of SmackDown, Otis and Tucker tried apologized to Rose, but Rose dismissed his apology. On the March 20 episode of SmackDown, Ziggler distracted Otis and Tucker by showing pictures of him and Rose and caused them to get disqualifed in a match against The Miz and John Morrison. On the April 3 episode of SmackDown, Tucker was attacked by Ziggler ahead of Ziggler's WrestleMania match with Otis. The following week on SmackDown, Tucker challenged Ziggler to a rematch but was unsuccessful. At WrestleMania 36, Otis defeated Ziggler with the help of Rose, who kissed him after the match. On May 10 at Money in the Bank, Otis won the briefcase after AJ Styles and King Corbin tussled over the briefcase and dropped it to Otis unintentionally. As part of the 2020 Draft in October, Tucker was drafted to the Raw brand and Otis remained on the SmackDown brand, splitting the team.

It is a multi-component stratified site representing several Prehistoric Upper Mississippian occupations as well as minor Late Woodland and Early Historic components. The site contains a total of 12 burial mounds, the main ones being the Big East Mound and the Big West Mound. Around the mounds are 50 house pits.  History of archaeological investigations  George Langford, a mechanical engineer, located the site and excavated it for several years, eventually bringing it to the attention of the archaeological world. According to Langford, he first visited the site in 1898 and by 1906-1907 he was excavating on a small scale with the assistance of Howard Calmer. In 1922 the site began to be impacted by farming activities and Langford realized the loss of information that was taking place. This spurred him into large-scale excavations with his associate Albert Tennik, starting in 1924. In 1927 Langford issued the first site report. After Langford's work, additional excavations took place under the auspices of the University of Chicago and the WPA.  Results of data analysis  Excavations at the site yielded Prehistoric and Historic artifacts, burials, house structures, pit features, animal bone and plant remains. = Stratigraphy = Three distinct Upper Mississippian levels were observed in Langford's excavations, each with its own diagnostic artifacts, especially related to changes in pottery styles. There were also differences in skeletal morphology, especially in the shape of the skull. J.W. Griffin in a 1948 paper referred to these levels as ‚ÄúPeriods A, B and C‚Äù, with Period B having by far the most material. The surface soil formed a layer to a depth of 3 feet, which Langford called the ‚ÄúUpper Level‚Äù. Underneath was a one-inch layer of blackened soil which was called the ‚ÄúBlack Seam‚Äù. Underneath the Black Seam was 1-1/2 feet of soil and gravel underlain by a 6-inch layer of white ashes, black charcoal, brown earth, bone and shell called the ‚ÄúAsh Layer‚Äù. Following these layers carefully, Langford was able to assign each burial to its correct stratigraphic level. The earliest phase is represented by several ‚Äúlong head‚Äù burials without grave goods, in the gravel beneath the Upper Mississippian layers. The upper levels contain small amounts of Late Woodland and Historic materials in disturbed contexts. In between laid the Upper Mississippian deposits.  Period A  Period A represents the earliest Upper Mississippian phase represented at Fisher. It is located below the Ash Level close to and below the actual ground level. There are no radiocarbon dates available at the Fisher site, but comparisons with sites yielding similar artifacts with radiocarbon dates suggest a time period of approximately A.D. 1100‚Äì1300. The burials associated with Period A are extended burials with short high heads. Most of the pots have shell spoons and had a greasy texture and small fragments of bone, as if they originally contained food when they were buried. The primary diagnostic artifact of Period A is the distinctive shell-tempered cordmarked pottery with elaborate decoration originally termed ‚Äúantler-point‚Äù pottery by Langford since he assumed the incised lines of decoration were applied in the wet clay by the tip of an antler prior to firing in the kiln. The predominant vessel form was globular with restricted orifice and vertical to excurved rim profile. Lips were frequently notched. The following non-pottery artifacts were recovered from the Period A deposits. Most of these were grave goods. Significantly, bone artifacts outnumber stone artifacts in both Periods A and B: * Bone artifacts - detached antler tines, worked fish spine, fish hooks, cut animal jaws, socketed antler projectile points, ‚Äúgolf-tee‚Äù-style antler projectile points and celt-like antler scrapers * Shell artifacts - beads, pendants, hoes, scrapers and spoons * Chipped stone artifacts - triangular projectile points * Ground stone artifacts - celts and hammerstones * Copper artifacts - beads and ear discs * Mineral - red ochre  Period B  Period B corresponds to the deposits between the Black Seam and the Ash Layer. It dates to a time period of approximately A.D. 1200-1500 based on comparisons with sites yielding similar artifacts with radiocarbon dates. The burials associated with Period B are extended burials with differing skull types: short high, long or round heads. Burials 115 and 116 in the Big East Mound contained a unique artifact and bone cache including 3 triangular projectile points, 1 slender projectile point, 2 tarsal bones from turkey and heron, 2 deer ankle bones, 2 beaver incisors, a mink jaw bone, bird bones and antler projectile points. Another skeleton was buried with 2 wildcat humeri, and otter, raccoon and mink skulls. The house structures present at Fisher are thought to be associated with Period B. They show signs of double-walled design and wall-trench construction like houses found associated with the Heally Component at the Zimmerman site. The pottery from Period B was grit- tempered with predominantly cordmarked surface finish. Decoration was similar to the shell-tempered ware in Period A but less elaborate. Vessel form was similar except that lip notching was less frequent. The following non-pottery artifacts were recovered from the Period B deposits. Most of these were grave goods: * Bone artifacts - detached antler tines, scapula awls, splinter awls, beads, beamers, cut beaver incisors, game counters (antler or bone cylinders often accompanied by a stone tablet, which seemed to comprise a \\"game set\\"), perforated deer phalanges, harpoons, antler hoes, fish hooks, mat needles, pins, socketed antler projectile points, ‚Äúgolf-tee‚Äù-style antler projectile points, collared projectile points, flat bone projectile points and celt-like antler scrapers. The game counters have been recovered from other sites in the area but have not been reported with the tablets. At Fisher sometimes the counters are stuck to the tablets as if they were originally enclosed in a leather bag when included in the grave goods. * Shell artifacts - beads, fish hooks, hoes, scrapers and spoons * Chipped stone artifacts - triangular projectile points and drills (both simple and expanded-base) * Ground stone artifacts - arrowshaft straighteners, abraders, celtiform tablets (paired with antler game counters, as described above), discoidals, mullers, smoking pipes (equal-arm type), celts and hammerstones * Copper artifacts - beads, celts and ear discs * Mineral - red ochre  Period C  Period C corresponds to the deposits located above the Black Seam. This layer was not clearly demarcated from the Late Woodland and Historic material above it; and in relation to cultural remains was not well-represented compared to the first two periods. The pottery was grit-tempered like the previous period but undecorated. The only artifacts reported were chipped stone projectile points, shell beads and bone harpoons. The time period for this phase is thought to be after approximately A.D. 1500. = Animal remains = According to Langford, animal bone was common throughout the site. Deer bones predominated but other species were also represented such as elk, bear, dog, wildcat, otter, beaver, mink, weasel, skunk, raccoon, muskrat, rabbit, turkey, heron and goose. These remains were not modified into tools like the bone artifacts described elsewhere, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of some species, the remains of ceremonial activities or grave goods with spiritual significance. Dog sacrifice and dog meat consumption was observed to have ceremonial and religious implications in early Native American tribes. Bear ceremonialism has also been reported in Native American tribes of the American Midwest. Finally, the bones of some animals were used in medicine pouches as part of the practices of medicine societies such as the Midewiwin and False Face Society. The presence of species like mink, wildcat and heron, especially in burials, implies these bones may have been part of medicine bundles intended to accompany the deceased into the afterlife. = Plant remains = Plant remains were not systematically collected in the Fisher excavations since the use of flotation techniques were not yet widely adopted. However, it was reported that large quantities of maize were recovered and there is little doubt that the Fisher inhabitants were an agricultural society, although hunting still provided for a large portion of their subsistence. = Pottery = Archaeologists often find pottery to be a very useful tool in analyzing a prehistoric culture. It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture. Many complete or reconstructable vessels were found with the Fisher Mound burials, which greatly facilitated the artifact analysis. In 1927 Langford described the pottery found in the three Upper Mississippian levels, but it was not until 1948 that JW Griffin developed a detailed typology. He called the shell-tempered pottery in Period A Fisher Ware, and the grit- tempered pottery in Periods B and C Langford Ware.  Fisher Ware  * Fisher Trailed - shell-tempered, globular vessels with cordmarked or smoothed- over cordmarked surface finish and restricted orifice with vertical to excurved rim profile. Lips are often notched. Loop and strap handles, as well as lugs, are sometimes present. Decoration occurs between the rim and shoulder in the form of wide-trailed lines often combined with punctates forming festoons, arches and chevrons. Langford called this style of decoration ‚Äúantler-point‚Äù because it seemed to him that the width and depth of the lines could have been the result of using the point of an antler tine to trace the patterns in the wet clay before the vessel was fired. The presence of antler tines in some of the burials suggested to him that the tools used to create the pot may have been left in the grave along with the vessel itself. * Fisher Noded - same as Fisher Trailed except for the presence of nodes extruding outward on the surface, created by pressing the wet clay from the interior.  Langford Ware  * Langford Trailed - grit-tempered with cordmarked or smoothed-over cordmarked surface. Similar decorations as Fisher Trailed except less elaborate, with arches being more common than festoons. Vessel form is similar to Fisher Trailed. Unlike the Fisher ware, notched lips are uncommon, as are handles and lugs. * Langford Corded - same as Langford Trailed except no decoration * Langford Plain - same as Langford Trailed except no decoration and surface is not cordmarked * Langford Noded - same as Langford Trailed except for the presence of nodes extruding outward on the surface, created by pressing the wet clay from the interior. = Cultural summary =  Fisher Tradition  The Upper Mississippian Fisher Tradition is thought to have emerged after the establishment of the large Middle Mississippian city of Cahokia in the southern part of Illinois in approximately A.D. 1050. The Cahokian culture probably exerted a great deal of influence on the surrounding communities, and recent evidence indicates it was Cahokia that introduced maize agriculture to most of the eastern portion of North America. Fisher was first identified at the Fisher Mound Group but other sites have been found with similar material culture elsewhere in Illinois as well as northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan (where it is part of the Berrien Phase at Moccasin Bluff). The presence of shell-tempered cordmarked pottery at the Griesmer and Fifield sites in Indiana associated with a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1530 along with late-period artifacts implies that this tradition survived in some form almost until the Protohistoric and/or early Historic Period. This could potentially mean that Fisher represents one of the historic Native American tribes encountered by the early European explorers and fur traders.  Langford Tradition  The material culture of the Upper Mississippian Langford Tradition has been identified at many sites in the Kankakee, Des Plaines and Illinois River valleys in Illinois. It corresponds to the Heally Component at the Zimmerman Site, and is also present at the Plum Island and Gentleman Farm sites on the Illinois River near Zimmerman. Radiocarbon dates of A.D. 1210-1490 have been reported for Langford, which makes it mostly contemporaneous with Fisher. The formation of Langford (like Fisher) may be related to the rise of Cahokia, and it has been noted that most Langford sites have small amounts of Middle Mississippian pottery in their assemblages.  Significance  The Fisher site, which was first excavated over a century ago, was one of the first Upper Mississippian sites in Illinois to be investigated intensively by archaeologists. The stratified deposits present at the site aided in the development of a timeline for cultural timeline of the region. As a result, subsequent excavations at Upper Mississippian sites in the American Midwest were often analyzed through the typological framework developed at Fisher. Comparisons with other sites have helped archaeologists define the cultural identity of the Fisher and Langford Traditions and how they relate temporally and spatially with other Upper Mississippian cultures such as Huber and Oneota.

She previously worked as a senior staffer in the United States Department of Health and Human Services and White House policy advisor during the presidency of Barack Obama and was an aide to Hillary Clinton during her time in the United States Senate.  Early life and education  Palm was born and raised in Star Lake, New York. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in human services studies from Cornell University and Master of Social Work from the Washington University in St. Louis.  Career  Palm began her career as a legislative assistant for California Congressman Bob Matsui. She then worked as a Health Policy Advisor to then-U.S. Senator, Hillary Clinton. In 2009 Palm was appointed Deputy Assistant United States Secretary of Health and Human Services for Legislation by President Barack Obama. Since the role of Assistant Secretary for Legislation was vacant, she served as Acting Assistant Secretary during that time. Palm then served as a policy advisor to the United States Domestic Policy Council at the White House. She rejoined the Department of Health and Human Services to serve as an advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Health and Chief of Staff of the HHS. = Wisconsin DHS = In January 2019, Governor-elect Tony Evers nominated Palm to serve as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Palm and other Evers-nominated cabinet secretaries began performing their duties while their confirmation hearings were pending. Palm's nomination stalled in the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature, with members citing Palms decision to name a former Planned Parenthood lobbyist as her deputy. Wisconsin State Senate Majority Leader, Scott L. Fitzgerald, has continued to block Palm's nomination from appearing before a full Senate vote.  COVID-19 response  While still acting as Secretary-designee, Palm has been tasked with managing Wisconsin's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Various mayors requested that Palm use her authority as Secretary to prevent in-person voting during the 2020 Wisconsin Democratic primary. Governor Tony Evers signed an executive order for all- mail-in election, but the order was rejected by the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature. In May 2020, the Legislature filed a lawsuit against Palm personally, accusing her of \\"violating state law by extending the governor's emergency rules, exceeded her authority by closing businesses and locking down individuals, acting 'arbitrarily and capriciously' in her order, and usurping the legislature's oversight powers\\". Member-elect of the U.S. House of Representatives Tom Tiffany later called on Palm to resign. An updated stay-at-home order, issued by Palm, was struct down in a ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, effectively reopening several businesses in the state against warnings by public health officials. In the decision, the Court ruled that while Governor Evers had emergency powers authority, Palm did not.  Personal life  Palm is married to Dan Utech, a former advisor in the United States Department of Energy and United States Domestic Policy Council. Utech later served as Deputy Assistant to Barack Obama for Energy and Climate Change before becoming a lecturer at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies.

The church was founded in 1866 by African American members of another Baptist church in the city. The current building, built in 1888, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.  History  In 1865, African American members of First Baptist Church in Marietta, Georgia (many of whom had been slaves prior to the Civil War) petitioned the church for dismissal in order to form a black church under their own administration. This dismissal was granted the following year and Zion Baptist Church was officially founded on April 8, 1866, with Reverend Ephraim Rucker as the church's first pastor. The 88 original members of this congregation constructed a wooden church house on land donated by First Baptist. In 1888, this building was converted to a brick church building. This building would serve as the congregation's meeting house until 1978, when a new building was constructed across the street from this structure. As membership continued to grow, another building was constructed by the church in 2007. The 1888 building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 11, 1990. Today, tours are given of the restored building, which occasionally hosts weddings.

It is situated 63 kilometres northeast of the city proper, on the east bank of the Pulangi River. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 2,324 people.  Geography  Saint Peter is bounded to the north by Busdi, to the east by the province of Agusan del Sur, to the south by Zamboanguita and Caburacanan, and to the west by Kulaman. It is subdivided into eleven purok and four sitios. The sitios are Mahayag, Pinuwakan, Tawantawan, and Balaudo. Saint Peter is an entry point to Sitio Bendum of Barangay Busdi. It is situated between the Pulangi River and the Pantaron Range and is characterized by a mountainous terrain and dense forests. It is drained by the Tigpaniki and Namnam rivers, which ultimately flows into the Pulangi River. Like the rest of the Pantaron Range, Saint Peter also hosts a diverse wildlife, including some endemic species of trees, plants, birds, and mammals. Four new species of pitcher plant was recently discovered in Sitio Mahayag and Sitio Balaudo.  Socio-economic profile  Situated in the hinterlands of central Mindanao, Saint Peter is a relatively poor community relying on agriculture as its chief economic activity. Rice, corn, abac√°, coffee, and rubber are the chief crops produced there. There is a well-maintained road leading into Saint Peter from Zamboanguita and there are hanging bridges from Caburacanan and Kulaman across the Pulangi River. In the education sector, Saint Peter is under the administration of the Division of Malaybalay City in District X. There are three elementary schools, two of which are schools for indigenous peoples. These are Saint Peter Elementary School in the village proper, Pigpamulahan Elementary School in Mahayag, and Yandang Elementary School in Balaudo. There is also one high school, Saint Peter National High School, which was recently separated from its mother school in Silae. The peace and order situation in the village is not good, some of its sitios are sometimes raided by the rebel New People's Army who use these hamlets to traverse into the Caraga Region, threatening the peace and order of the community. This led to the local government to declare such group as persona non grata.  History  The natives call the area of what is now Saint Peter as Sumpilen or Sumpilon. It was settled by the Higaonon people as a hamlet which eventually grew into a sitio of the much older community of Caburacanan. According to folk history, it was Dat√π Lauman Aninayon who founded the village. Later, Catholic and Protestant missionaries proselytized the Upper Pulangi area and converted the populace. The name of the village was changed as a result of a joke when then- Malaybalay Mayor Lorenzo Dinlayan and the provincial warden Pedro Abunda asked for the real name of the village, to which the people replied \\"Pedro\\". After an actual deliberation of the name change, the name \\"Saint Peter\\" was agreed to commemorate the Christian influence on the community. In 1972, as per Republic Act 3590, the village of Saint Peter‚Äîformerly Sumpilen‚Äîwas separated from Caburacanan and converted as a regular barangay of Malaybalay  References  Barangays of Bukidnon Barangays of Malaybalay ","title":"Saint Peter, Malaybalay"},{"id":"63971527","text":"The 2006 Junior Pan American Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships was held in Toronto, Canada, August 27‚Äì29, 2006.Folha de Londrina (in Portuguese)USA Gymnastics - November/December 2006The Gazette Tuesday, August 29, 2006 - Page 36 Medal summary { - ! scope=row style=\\"text-align:left\\"   Anastasia Torba Rachel Marmer Marlee Shape  Demetra Mantcheva Jessica Ho Rose Cossar  Sofia Sanchez - ! scope=row style=\\"text-align:left\\"     - ! scope=row style=\\"text- align:left\\"     - ! scope=row style=\\"text-align:left\\"      - ! scope=row style=\\"text-align:left\\"     - ! scope=row style=\\"text- align:left\\"     - ! scope=row style=\\"text-align:left\\"     } References 2006 in gymnastics Pan American Gymnastics Championships International gymnastics competitions hosted by Canada 2006 in Canadian sports ","title":"2006 Junior Pan American Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships"},{"id":"63971545","text":"David Clifford Vigen (October 5, 1933 ‚Äì May 9, 2019) was an American Christian minister and politician.

He is the co-founder of The Walter and Shirley Wang Foundation, and JMM Foundation, a philanthropic organization. He is also the CEO of JM Eagle, a global manufacturer of plastic pipe. Wang's father was Wang Yung-ching, founder of the plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group and one of the wealthiest individuals in Taiwan before his death in 2008. His sister is Cher Wang, co-founder and chairperson (since 2007) of HTC Corporation and integrated chipset maker VIA Technologies.  Early life and education  Wang's father was Taiwanese billionaire, Wang Yung-ching, who is known informally as Y.C. Wang. Y.C. Wang died on October 15, 2008, at age 91. Wang is the youngest of Y.C. Wang's five children by Wang Yang Chiao. When Wang was nine years old, Wang Yang Chiao left Taiwan against Y.C. Wang's wishes, forgoing fame and fortune, despite having helped to build the Formosa Plastics conglomerate, in order to bring Wang to California to shield them from the family strife in Taiwan. They moved to Berkeley, California to be closer to one of Yang Chiao's older children, Cher Wang. Wang attended University of California - Berkeley before moving back to Taiwan to work for his father's corporation, Formosa Plastics Group, in 1988. He met his wife, Shirley Wang, in 1990. Three months later, Y.C. Wang summoned Walter Wang to move to New Jersey, to help turn around the struggling JM Manufacturing. Career In 2005, Wang purchased JM Manufacturing through syndicated loans from his father. In 2007, Wang bought PW Eagle, another large PVC pipe producer, to form JM Eagle. JM Eagle continues to exceed $1 billion in sales. JM Eagle relocated its headquarters to Los Angeles, California in 2008. The company has over 1,300 employees in 21 plants throughout the U.S., Mexico, and China. Wang is a board member of the publicly listed Formosa Petrochemical and Formosa Chemical and Fiber Corporations in Taiwan. He is also a member of the Young Presidents Organization Los Angeles and Intercontinental chapters. He belongs to the World Economic Forum and the Committee of 100 (C-100). Wang sits on the Board of Directors for the Danny Thompson Memorial Leukemia Foundation, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, the DEA Educational Foundation, the Chinese Overseas Exchange Association, and the Boao Forum in China. Along with his wife, Wang is a trustee of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and both serve on the board of the Los Angeles Olympic Committee 2028.  Philanthropy  Wang is a benefactor to causes in the United States and internationally, ranging from education to healthcare, social and immigration issues, anti-drug campaigns, and efforts to raise cultural awareness. He is co-founder of the Walter and Shirley Wang Foundation and the JMM Foundation, along with his wife. JM Eagle participates in various philanthropic efforts, namely those where polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping can help facilitate the acquisition of natural resources in underprivileged communities. In 2009, The Earth Institute of Columbia University's \\"Millennium Project\\" partnered with the United Nations and JM Eagle to establish innovative water systems in several Sub-Saharan countries, including Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda. This project provided water to 13,500 people with 70 miles of pipe to 52 villages. JM Eagle donated over 300 miles of pipe that bring water to over 300,000 people in Africa as well as plastic pipe and other materials to transport drinking water from a mountain spring to a community of 5,000 people in Honduras. JM Eagle has also provided scholarships for young African girls to assist in education through college and aided in water delivery and sanitation systems in Northern Thailand. JM Eagle supports China's initiative to provide its entire population with clean water. JM provides piping to low income housing through Habitat for Humanity, as well as helped to build the New York Outward Bound inner city youth center. Together, the Wangs established an endowed chair at the Cedar Sinai Medical Center for Pediatric Surgery, both to fund novel research in pediatric surgery and to assist underprivileged children in need of surgery. In 2012, the Walter and Shirley Wang Foundation provided emergency relief blankets for Syrian refugees in Jordan. The Walter and Shirley Wang Foundation helped establish the DEA Museum in Los Angeles, California, with the goal of educating the public on illegal drugs and trafficking. They also support Doctors Without Borders. Walter and Shirley Wang established an endowment at University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA), Shirley Wang's alma mater, to support students from middle-income families and have given scholarships in chemistry and biochemistry to students, graduate students, middle-income students, fellowships, and study abroad programs. The Wangs have also endowed a chair for Asian American Studies and a chair for Medicinal Discovery at UCLA. The couple also funded Wang Hall at Harvard Westlake School in Los Angeles, California, and provided the lead donation for the renovation of the Harvard Westlake Humanities and Art Building. At UCLA, they endowed the first academic chair on U.S.-China relations and Chinese American studies in the United States. In the interest of Chinese-U.S. relations, the Wangs funded six staff positions at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Los Angeles to help provide legal services to immigrant survivors of domestic violence. Likewise, the Wangs funded three documentaries on Chinese-American history and pressing social issues in China, where they also strongly support AIDS-prevention campaigns. The documentary The Blood of Yingzhou District, which focuses on the AIDS epidemic in China, won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). A second film, The Warriors of Qiugang, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 2010, propelled the Chinese government to invest the American equivalent of $30 million to clean up the toxic waste around the waterway where the film takes place. The Wangs are the most prominent sponsors of the Emmy-nominated PBS documentary Becoming American: The Chinese Experience by [Bill Moyers]. The three-part, six-hour documentary examines immigration, citizenship, and the Chinese- American experience. In the wake of the COVID-19 global pandemic, JM Eagle and Plastpro, Inc. also donated surgical masks to Ohio facilities local to the Plastpro, Inc. factory. Walter and Shirley Wang donated $1 million to the Mayor's Fund of Los Angeles, in addition to supplies for face shields intended for use at Cedars Sinai Medical Center and the Innovation Lab at UCLA. Recognition Wang received the Model Overseas Chinese Young Entrepreneur Award, presented by the president of Taiwan, in 1998, the Best Manufacturer Award from the Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce in 2005, and was the recipient of the Committee of 100 Philanthropy Award in 2007. Wang personally received the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2006. His wife, Shirley Wang, received the award in 2011 on behalf of her work with the Walter and Shirley Wang Foundation. The Wangs have been supporters of projects to address social and healthcare problems in China, including seed-stage and ongoing support for the China AIDS Initiative, an awareness and prevention program. Through this organization, they have funded public service announcements that have reached 500 million people to help stop the spread of AIDS and discourage cigarette smoking in China. Wang and his wife have been recognized by the China AIDS Initiative in 2006, the Museum of Chinese in America in New York in 2007, and the Los Angeles Chinatown Public Safety Association in 2008, as well as honored by Asian Americans Advancing Justice with its 2010 Public Service Award. In August 2011, Mr. Wang was inducted into the DEA Education Foundation Board of Directors. The Foundation conducts fundraising, advocacy, educational outreach, exhibit sponsorship, and educational program development in support of the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum, which enlightens the public on the issues of illegal drugs and trafficking. On May 29, 2013, Mr. Wang received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the DEA for his advocacy in the prevention of drug use. The Wangs received both the China Institute's Blue Cloud Award and the Philanthropy Award from the Asia Society in 2016. The couple were honored by the Anti-Defamation League with their Humanitarian Award in 2018. Personal Life Ten days after purchasing JM Eagle in 2005, Wang was diagnosed with stage-four nasal cancer. He was issued a clean bill of health in mid-2006. During Wang's chemotherapy treatments in a Hong Kong hospital, JM Eagle, then known as J-M Manufacturing, faced a whistleblower lawsuit. In January 2006, an engineer accused JM Eagle of selling billions of dollars' worth of defective pipe to states and municipalities around the United States, and the company was sued under the federal False Claims Act. A Los Angeles jury found JM Eagle liable for failing to make 100 percent of its pipe, according to Underwriters Laboratories standards, though an Underwriters Laboratories engineer testified that the company never fell out of compliance during repeated audits. The whistleblower, John Hendrix, had been fired after a customer complained Hendrix had attempted bribery to favorably resolve a warranty claim. Only two of the five municipalities suing in the first phase of the trial reported any defective pipe, and two others, the state of Nevada and Norfolk, Virginia, both admitted they continued to purchase JM products while aware of the allegations in the lawsuit. JM Eagle sued Phillips & Cohen for libel for post- verdict comments suggesting its products are dangerous and defective. J-M Manufacturing was involved in a federal qui tam action brought on by various public entities, but while the lawsuit was pending law firm Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton went on to represent one of the public entities involved. Both clients had signed engagement agreements stating they had waived any such conflicts of interest, but the agreements did not disclose the specific conflicts, and Shepard did not advise either client of the conflicts. In August 2018, the California Supreme Court reversed a fee award that had been granted in favor of the law firm, maintaining that the firm's conflict of interest invalidated its entire agreement with J-M Manufacturing, including the arbitration clause, and thereby rendered its fee award a nullity.

It was released on November 14, 2019, as the lead single from his second studio album Gr√¶ through Jagjaguwar. The song was written by Sumney alongside industrial rock duo, YVETTE, consisting Noah Kardos-Fein and Dale Eisinger. It was produced by Sumney, with additional production by Andrew Chugg, Ben Baptie, also electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never under the alias, Daniel Lopatin. Composition The track explores about the concept of masculinity. As described by Elizabeth Aubrey of NME, lyrically, through this song Sumney \\"thrashes against the status quo\\" as stated with lines: \\"You've got the wrong guy / You wanna slip right in / Amp up the masculine / You've got the wrong idea, son.\\" Similar idea is echoed by A.D. Amorosi of Variety. He commented that \\"Sumney taking the piss out of everyday machismo and the rarity of gallantry.\\" Jayson Greene of Pitchfork interpreted the lyrics as \\"a withering send-up of the pointlessness of toxic masculinity in a world where the body inevitably turns to dust and matter.\\" The track is instrumentally complete with strings, guitar, percussion, drums, harps, cello, flute, piano and bass. Musically, Aubrey commented that the song's \\"gentle harps and soft flutes are overwhelmed by thunderous beats and clashing synths.\\" Max Freedman of The A.V. Club called the musical direction of the track as \\"arena-ready grunge\\". Kitty Empire of The Observer described the sound of the track as \\"allied with waves of lavish instrumentation and pugnacious rhythms.\\" Critical reception The track was met with favorable reviews. Timmhotep Aku of Afropunk praised Sumney's \\"signature falsetto\\" and called it \\"gives way to guitar power chords\\". Ben Kaye of Consequence of Sound praised the track and described it was \\"hard to pin down\\" and as \\"a clash of TV on the Radio indie and thudding The Smashing Pumpkins alternative with the drama of an art-rock opera.\\" While reviewing the associated album, A.D. Amorosi of Variety called the track as the album's \\"musical moratorium\\". Comparing the track's tone to his debut studio album Aromanticism, Marcus J. Moore of Entertainment Weekly called the track \\"verges closer to a positive declaration, as Sumney pushes through darkness toward a semblance of light.\\" Elisa Bray of The Independent praised the track and described it as \\"a satisfying contrast of textures incorporates a growling drone, soft flute and his angelic vocals.\\" Music video The accompanying music video of \\"Virile\\" was released the same day as the track. It was directed by Sumney himself as his directorial debut. About the video, Sumney commented the video took place \\"in a post-human world, the last remaining man is caught between beauty and brutality's battle to dominate the earth and his body.\\" The video features Sumney performing an interpretive dance number, as he convulses across the fog-swirled floor of a meat locker while carcasses swing behind him on hooks. Digital video channel, Nowness described the video that \\"Sumney tiptoes between the topics of brutality and beauty, masculinity and femininity, as well as, constrain and freedom.\\" Personnel *Moses Sumney ‚Äì vocals, songwriting, production, engineering *YVETTE ‚Äì songwriting **Noah Kardos-Fein ‚Äì guitar *Andrew Chugg ‚Äì additional production, engineering *Ben Baptie ‚Äì additional production, engineering, drum programming, mixing *Daniel Lopatin ‚Äì additional production *Alexis Berthelot ‚Äì engineering *Joe LaPorta ‚Äì mastering *Rashaan Carter ‚Äì harp engineering *Thundercat ‚Äì bass *Ian Chang ‚Äì drums *Brandee Younger ‚Äì harp *Nubya Garcia ‚Äì flute *Rob Moose ‚Äì string, string arrangement *Keith Tutt II ‚Äì cello Credits adapted from the liner notes of Gr√¶.

Dog Police is a short-lived 1980s new wave band from Memphis, Tennessee that briefly gained notoriety for the music video of their 1982 single, \\"Dog Police\\". In 1983, the video was featured on MTV's late-night show Basement Tapes, which aired homemade music videos and asked audience members to call in and vote for their favorites. \\"Dog Police\\" won a semi-final round in January 1984, but came in second in the finals. The video played in light rotation on MTV through February 1984. The band was a side project of the Tony Thomas Trio, a Memphis jazz band that began performing together in 1979. After their Basement Tapes appearances, the \\"Dog Police\\" video aired on USA Network's Night Flight in July 1984, and Weird Al Yankovic's MTV show Al TV in September 1984. In 1990, an eight and a half minute television pilot was made called The Dog Police, with a modified version of the song as the theme. The cast of the pilot includes Jeremy Piven and Adam Sandler, filmed just before Sandler's breakthrough on Saturday Night Live. Band The Tony Thomas Trio is a Memphis jazz band that formed in 1979, including keyboard-vocalist Tony Thomas, bassist Sam Shoup and drummer Tom Lonardo. The band's music has been described as \\"late 70s-era progressive- tinged fusion jazz-rock,\\" similar to The Mothers of Invention. As a side project, the trio formed a novelty new wave band called Dog Police, using the pseudonyms Clark Radio (Thomas), Squeek Owens (Lonardo) and Random Ax (Shoup). The band was inspired by new wave pioneers Devo. In 1982, the band released a self-published album, Dog Police, with ten songs, including \\"1-800\\" (which also had a music video), \\"Are You Middle Class Enough?\\", \\"I'm Butch\\" and \\"Positive Reinforcement.\\" The album was re-released in 2019 on vinyl and digitally by Toxic Toast Records, including two bonus tracks. The Tony Thomas Trio has released several non-canine albums, including LST on Jazzoid (1979) and Progreso from Genuine Memphis Music (2010). The band has also performed with Ella Fitzgerald and the Duke Ellington Orchestra, and has recorded many commercial jingles. Song The song tells the story of a young man who takes a woman out for a blind date. He describes her as \\"a chick from the canine scene\\" who scratches a flea when she gets out of his car, but he appears to be enamored with her nonetheless. They have a seat and order drinks at the Lone Star bar, but when the man comes back from a brief trip to the bathroom, he finds that his date is being arrested by the Dog Police. The second verse implies that the man went on to have \\"puppies\\" with his date. The song's catchy chorus, repeated many times, runs: :(woof! woof! woof! woof!) :Dog Police! :Where are you coming from? :Dog Police! :Nobody knows who you are! It has been pointed out that this chorus has the same lyrics as the theme for \\"Spidey Super Stories\\", the Spider-Man segment that aired from 1974 to 1977 on the educational children's TV show The Electric Company. Video In the video, Tony Thomas plays the man on a date, picking up a beautiful woman wearing a dog mask. When the Dog Police show up, the three band members perform as hound-faced detectives in trench coats. The three are also seen on stage, singing in bright-colored outfits; at the end of the video, they mix the costumes, wearing the dog faces and hats but dressed as band members from the neck down. The \\"Dog Police\\" music video was produced by Wayne Crook and directed by Joe Mulherin, with costumes and dog masks by William \\"Bill\\" Knopfler and cinematography by documentary filmmaker Larry McConkey. The club scene was shot in the Madison House, a Memphis club. Dog Police got their big break on MTV's Basement Tapes, a late-night show that premiered in March 1983, holding a monthly competition to select the best unsigned band. Bands were invited to submit videocassettes of their performances, and viewers were given a 1-900 number to vote for their favorites. The \\"Dog Police\\" video won the semi-final round in January 1984, winning five thousand dollars in equipment and the right to compete in the finals in April. The final prize was $25,000 worth of equipment and a recording contract with EMI. The band took second place in the finals. Following the song's January win, the video was a minor sensation on MTV, and played in light rotation (two plays a day) during the month of February. The video also aired on USA Network's Night Flight on August 17, 1984, and MTV's Al TV on September 3rd. Television pilot An eight-and-a-half minute TV pilot titled The Dog Police was produced in spring 1990. The pilot also stars three dog-faced detectives in trenchcoats and hats, with marginally more realistic canine heads, who work for the police department in an otherwise human workplace-sitcom world. The theme song states that the dogs come from outer space, with no further explanation. The song has new lyrics, replacing the \\"Spidey Stories\\" plagiarism with a new chorus: :(woof! woof! woof! woof!) :Dog Police! :They're righting every wrong :Dog Police! :Helping wherever you go! The three detectives are Bowser, his ex-wife Mia and his best friend Ollie. The dogs are endowed with superpowers: they have ESP, they can run 50 miles an hour, and they can hear conversations from two miles away. Jeremy Piven appears in the show as a beat cop, and Adam Sandler plays Shifty, an ex-criminal that's friends with the dogs. The pilot never aired. The pilot opens with a sequence of the Dog Police tracking down a pair of criminals with their psychic powers. After the theme, the dogs are introduced, and there's a scene of them interacting with fellow cops in the police precinct. An emergency call comes in, and the harried chief sends the dogs out to solve the crime. In the final scene, the dogs find Shifty taking the wheels off their police car; they have to use their special alien-canine powers to put the car back together before they can ride away to fight crime. Bowser wraps up by saying, \\"Every dog has his day. Ours is Saturday. Come join us for action and adventure, as we sniff out crime, and maybe a laugh or two. And remember: with us around, criminals might as well roll over and play dead.\\" There are no credits.

It was founded in August 1936 and at the time of its dissolution in 1938 it had around 350,000 members between the ages of 6 and 18. It represented the youth organization of the Fatherland Front.  History  Already in 1933, under Engelbert Dollfuss, there were plans to set up an \\"apolitical, patriotic youth organization\\" with the name \\"Young Fatherland\\".Johanna Gehmacher: youth without a future. Hitler Youth and the Federation of German Girls in Austria before 1938, Picus, Vienna 1994, , pp. 401‚Äì420 (dissertation Uni Wien 1993, under the title: National Socialist Youth Organizations in Austria, 479 pages). In March 1934, the Catholic youth organizations were united in the \\"Austrian Young Front\\", officially, but mainly for the planned state youth closed to preserve the patriotic interests and to counter strengthened. An organization \\"Young Fatherland\\" was also created, however, as an organization of the home guard (which at the time acted as \\"Austrian Homeland Security\\"), it finally had 70,000 members in 2000 local groups across Austria. The Fatherland Front wanted a youth organization based on the Italian Balilla or the German Hitler Youth. The foundation in 1936 was preceded by a working group of the youth organizations of the Austrian Homeland Security, Young Fatherland, Ostm√§rkische Sturmscharen, and the Ostmarkjugend.  Creation and development  On August 12, 1936, Guido Zernatto announced for the first time the name of the planned youth organization, \\"Austrian Young People\\". The √ñJV was founded on August 28, 1936, through the amalgamation of Young Fatherland and Ostmarkjugend. In the law on the patriotic upbringing of youth outside school, which came into force the next day, [2]All non-denominational youth clubs and groups outside of the state youth were subject to an authorization requirement. The continued existence of youth groups was linked to the membership of the association's membership in the √ñJV, provided that it was not an association solely for the purpose of vocational training or Catholic youth organizations. In November 1936, the Christian-German gymnastics youth joined the √ñJV. There was a further strong increase in membership when, in the course of 1937, the Catholic youth associations with large members were also incorporated into the state youth. This was done under pressure from the regime and against the agreements of the concordat signed in 1933, in which the Catholic youth organizations were guaranteed in their existence. However, the church retained certain independence, the members of its youth organizations were members of both organizations and they could only be used for events of the √ñJV with the consent of the church authorities. Even though membership was never mandatory, the monopoly of the √ñJV was gradually expanded. For example, admission to the officer's career in the army or the granting of school fees were linked to membership in the state youth. Even after the membership ban for the Patriotic Front (VF) on October 31, 1937, members of the √ñJV who were under the age of 18 could still be admitted to the VF. Nevertheless, the regimen intended to summarize the entire Austrian youth in the √ñJV ultimately could not be realized. Among other things, this was due to the extensive activity of anti-regime, illegal youth associations, in particular the Austrian Hitler Youth, but also the Revolutionary Socialist Youth and the Austrian Communist Youth Association. These groups tried, sometimes successfully, to infiltrate the state youth and to influence the politically indifferent members in an anti-regime sense. Further reasons were the completely insufficient financial resources and the hostility of large parts of the Catholic clergy towards the state youth. The question of whether Protestant or Jewish youth associations (such as the Betar or the Hakoah ) should also be included in the √ñJV remained unanswered for a long time. Finally, in January 1938, it was decided that the same agreements should be made with Protestant youth associations as with Catholic ones, but that the Jewish associations should be grouped together in Austria's newly founded Jewish Youth Association. This was done with regard to latent anti-Semitismin large parts of the population, officially it was said that this should not be seen as anti-Semitism, but \\"it is hardly to be expected of Jewish parents to send their children to an organization in which the youth are raised according to the principles of Christianity\\" and one wants \\" take into account the self- chosen special position of Judaism. ‚ÄùHowever, Jews were not explicitly prohibited from joining the √ñJV. Due to the integrated, non-denominational Austrian Scout Association, a larger number of Jewish youths were also integrated into the state youth. In March 1938, after the Berchtesgaden Agreement, the National Socialists became more and more likely to take power, and many left-wing young people, including Hugo Pepper, joined the √ñJV in the hope of being able to form a united front for young people against the National Socialist threat. In fact, in the days leading up to Austria's integration, the state youth was one of the few active organizations on the part of the regime.  Resolution  After the \\"connection\\" the √ñJV was dissolved. While most of the members let themselves be integrated into the Hitler Youth without resistance, a small number of former members decided to actively resist National Socialism. Well-known √ñJV members in the Catholic conservative youth resistance were the brother's Fritz and Otto Molden and the lawyer Hubert Jurasek.  Organization  According to its statutes, the √ñJV was managed by a directorate. This consisted of Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, State Secretary Guido Zernatto, Minister of Education Hans Pernter, and Ernst R√ºdiger Starhemberg, who had been de facto disempowered since May 1936. The federal youth leader Georg Thurn-Valsassina, a brother-in-law of Starnberg, was responsible for the practical management. He was subordinate to the nine- state youth leaders and subsequently the district youth leaders and local youth leaders. Independent of the √ñJV local groups, so-called groups existed in much higher schools. Student Free Corps in contrast to the usual local groups were not led by adult youth leaders, but by senior middle school students.  Education content  The contents of the √ñJV were strongly oriented towards the state youth organizations in Germany and Italy. Physical training and pre-military upbringing were given absolute priority in the male sub-organization. In the age group of 14 to 18-year-olds, a field combat day with small-caliber shooting and training on the radio was planned as well as four physical exercise hours per month. In addition, the work program included a patriotic-cultural training and, to a lesser extent, a moral-religious one instruction given by the local priest. In addition to hiking afternoons and gymnastics, the main focus of the female √ñJV groups was training in reproductive activities such as cooking, childcare, and sewing.  Uniform and symbols  The uniform of the male members was strongly based on the adjustment of the former home guard. It consisted of an olive green shirt, a black tie and a green cap with the √ñJV badge. A cross was sewn on the sleeve. The female √ñJV members wore a dirndl dress with a shoulder scarf, which was held together by a brooch with the √ñJV badge. The badge was a stylized interleaving of the letters OeJV. The flag was green on one side and showed the association symbol, on the other white with a prickly cross..  See also  * Deutsches Jungvolk  Literature  * Johanna Gehmacher: youth without a future.

He was instrumental in the development of long-range bombing and the development of the rigid airship as an efficient, high altitude, all-weather aircraft.

As such late in the war Strasser planned a five Zeppelin raid on the United Kingdom. The raid would be dynamic with the exact target changing depending on the weather. His orders were to attack south or middle England hoping to even reach London. On the afternoon of 5 August 1918, LZ 112 took off from Friedrichshafen with four other airships. They headed for the east coast of England, timing their flight to arrive off the coast just after dark. The commander of LZ 112 was Fregattenkapit√§n Peter Strasser, the F√ºhrer der Luftschiffe (\\"Leader of Airships\\", the commander of all Naval airships). However, the airship squadron was spotted out at sea by the Lenman Tail lightship, which signalled their course and position to the Admiralty. British RAF Major Egbert Cadbury was attending a charity concert at which his wife was performing when an RAF orderly found him. Cadbury drove back to the airfield, where he was informed that three Zeppelins had been reported about to the north-east, and knowing there was only one aircraft available, an Airco DH.4, he grabbed his flying kit and ran for it, beating a rival pilot to the cockpit by a split-second. With Captain Robert Leckie in the rear gunner's seat, Cadbury climbed up to over by jettisoning his reserve fuel and some small bombs, where he saw three Zeppelins ahead and above him. He later recounted: > At 22.20 we had climbed to 16,400 feet and I attacked the Zeppelin ahead > slightly to the port so as to clear any obstruction that might be suspended > from the airship. It was a most fascinating sight ‚Äì awe inspiring ‚Äì to see > this enormous Zeppelin blotting the whole sky above one. The tracers ignited > the escaping gas, the flames spreading rapidly and turning the airship into > a fireball in less than a minute. The LZ 112 dived headlong into the clouds. > It was one of the most terrifying sights I have ever seen to see this huge > machine hurtling down with all those crew on board. Cadbury and Leckie, and another pilot Lieutenant Ralph Edmund Keys, then attacked and damaged another Zeppelin, which promptly turned tail and headed for home. All three received the Distinguished Flying Cross. These airmen, Cadbury & Leckie, had already shot down two Zeppelins: prior to LZ 112, Cadbury had downed L 21 and Leckie, L 22.

The riots arose after the second Reform Bill was voted down in the House of Lords, stalling efforts at electoral reform. The arrival of the anti- reform judge Charles Wetherell in the city on 29 October led to a protest, which degenerated into a riot. The civic and military authorities were poorly focused and uncoordinated and lost control of the city. Order was restored on the third day by a combination of a posse comitatus of the city's middle-class citizens and military forces. Much of the city centre was burnt, up to ¬£300,000 of damage caused and up to 250 casualties incurred. The city's mayor Charles Pinney was tried for failing to prevent the riot and acquitted. The military commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Brereton was court-martialled on a similar charge and committed suicide before he could be sentenced. A renewed third reform bill passed in 1832, as the Great Reform Act, introducing sweeping changes to the electoral system. Local government in Bristol was likewise reformed with the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.  Background  Charles Wetherell In early 19th-century Britain there were large discrepancies in the size of constituencies of the lower house, the House of Commons. Some seats, so called rotten boroughs returned up to two Members of Parliament (MPs) from a small number of electors, while seats in new urban centres, such as Manchester, had no MPs. In March 1831 an attempt was made by the Whigs to introduce a Reform Bill to address the matter. This was defeated in parliament and the prime minister, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, resigned. Grey was returned to office with a majority in the subsequent general election and introduced a second Reform Bill. This passed in the House of Commons but was defeated in the Lords on 8 October 1831. Bristol, a city of 100,000 people, was represented by just two members of parliament. The rejection of the bill and the second resignation of Grey resulted in a period of political upheaval which has since been characterised as \\"the closest that Britain came to revolution\\". Inhabitants of cities and towns were angry at the failure to pass the bill and there were serious disturbances in London, Derby, Leicester, Yeovil, Sherborne, Exeter, Bath, Worcester and Bristol. The disturbances in Birmingham were so severe that the British Army's Scots Greys cavalry regiment was deployed to the city. Full scale riots erupted in Bristol, Nottingham and Derby. The Bristol Recorder (senior judge) Charles Wetherell was a noted opponent of the Reform Bill. Although he was given a hero's welcome in the city in 1829 for his opposition to Catholic emancipation, he sparked controversy in 1830 for stating in parliament that the people of Bristol opposed reform. The city had, in fact, sent a petition of 17,000 names to support reform and hosted large pro-reform public meetings in the first week of October. Wetherell himself was MP for the Yorkshire rotten borough of Boroughbridge. Boroughbridge, with just 48 electors, was set to be abolished by the Reform Bill. Wetherell was due to attend the court of assizes in Bristol at the end of October.  Preceding days  A soldier of the 3rd Dragoon Guards The Mayor of Bristol and head of its local authority, the Bristol Corporation, was Charles Pinney, a Whig and a supporter of the Reform Bill. His election, in September, may have been arranged by the other aldermen of the city, who were mainly anti-reform Tories, to curry favour with pro- reform elements and to reduce the likelihood of unrest. Pinney, by virtue of his office, was responsible for leading the response of the civil authorities to the riots. The citizens were angered as they regarded Pinney, who had not publicly supported electoral reform since taking office, as having abandoned the cause to join the Establishment. The Bristol Political Union (BPU), under William Herapath, was a key organisation in the city supporting reform. On 18 October the BPU broke up a meeting of sailors who were discussing forming a bodyguard for Wetherell's arrival. On 24 October a riot was narrowly averted when pro-reform citizens protested the arrival of George Henry Law, Bishop of Bath and Wells for the consecration of a new church in Bedminster. Law had voted against the Reform Bill in the House of Lords. The BPU met with the city magistrates in October and agreed to maintain neutrality during any civil disturbance, provided that troops were not used. Herapath called off the agreement on 25 October, when he learnt that the magistrates had requested troops be sent to the city. Herapath later stated that he was confident that he could have maintained order in the city, had the troops not been deployed. The Bristol under-sheriff had command of only 100 constables and estimated that at least 300 would be required to deal with the anticipated size of the protests against Wetherell. Herapath refused to allow BPU members to be enlisted as special constables and there were few volunteers from the middle class who were traditionally called upon to provide this service. The magistrates managed to enlist 119 volunteers, but many of these were of known violent tendencies. Despite having the power to do so the magistrates did not order the yeomanry or half-pay and retired army personnel to be called up. They did, however, clear weapons from the city's gun smiths in case of looting. The city magistrates requested British Army troops be sent to help with any disorder. The government was reluctant to send any, knowing that it would be unpopular with the public, but eventually the Home Secretary William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne authorised the deployment of a force of 93 soldiers to be only used in the case of an \\"absolute emergency\\". These were a mix of men from the 14th Light Dragoons and the 3rd Dragoon Guards. The 14th were unpopular in Bristol as they had recently been involved in the suppression of disorder in the West Country, where they had earned the nickname the \\"Bloody Blues\\". During the course of the riots men of this regiment, recognisable in their distinctive blue uniforms, would be jeered by the crowd while those of the 3rd, a regiment based locally, were cheered. Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Brereton was commander of the 3rd Dragoon Guards and led the military response to the riots. He was a supporter of reform and, after the riots, would be accused of having sympathies with the mob. When the troops arrived in the city the aldermen and magistrates refused to ride at the head of the troops as they crossed the city boundary, as tradition demanded. The officials were fearful that doing so would cause the mob to single out their businesses for looting and arson.  29 October  A 1901 depiction of the attack on Sir Charles Wetherell The location of Wetherell's entrance into the city had been changed for security reasons but soon became common knowledge and he was met with a mob upon his arrival on 29 October. The carriage carrying Wetherell and Pinney was stoned and they sought refuge at the corporation's Mansion House. Violence escalated, particularly after the special constables carried out a number of charges into the crowd, one of which led to the death of a member of the public. There were disputes between the dragoons and the constables over the perceived heavy-handedness of the latter. Pinney twice spoke to the crowd to attempt to regain control, but felt he had no option but to read the Riot Act at dusk, by which time many of the special constables had abandoned their posts. The rioting continued into the night and the Mansion House was stormed, the 14th Light Dragoons attempted to halt the riot and shot one man dead whilst doing so. Wetherell fled the Mansion House via the rooftop to an adjacent building and Pinney escaped to seek refuge at a friend's house where he spent much of the following day.  30 October  A contemporary depiction of a warehouse set ablaze during the riot The looting of the Mansion House continued from 7 am on 30 October, a Sunday. Its wine cellar was emptied and the building set on fire. Efforts to control the riot were hampered by a crowd of middle-class onlookers, who encouraged the rioters. Pinney ordered a notice to be read out in the city's places of worship that morning that ordered a posse comitatus to be formed. However, fewer than 200 men answered the call and these mostly dispersed when the civic authorities failed to organise them effectively. Part of the problem was that the civic authorities moved their headquarters between a number of different buildings. This meant that their leaders were hard to locate at key times, for example on 30 October a force of 57 men from the Dodington yeomanry arrived in the city but were withdrawn by their officer when no magistrate could be found to requisition lodgings. Herapath spoke to the mob but failed to halt the violence, he later offered to mobilise the BPU members as a peacekeeping force but was refused by Pinney who thought it would reflect badly upon the authorities. There was mistrust between the civic and military leaders and confusion over what actions to take. Pinney's orders to Brereton were vague and did not explicitly authorise the use of deadly force; at one point Brereton had to dissuade Pinney from issuing direct orders to fire into the crowd. Brereton had never served in a public order role before and behaved indecisively, he consistently overestimated the size of the rioting crowd and underestimated his ability to control it. Brereton may have been affected by the criticism the armed forces received for its actions in Manchester in 1819, in which 18 people were killed when cavalry charged a crowd in the so-called Peterloo Massacre. A charge by the 14th Dragoons in Corn Street against a mob attacking the Council House resulted in the deaths of two men. Brereton believed an element in the 14th were provoking trouble with the crowd and, assured by the mob that they would disperse if the \\"Bloody Blues\\" were sent away, ordered them to withdraw. There was a short lull in the fighting, during which Wetherell escaped from the city disguised as a woman, but the mob afterwards attacked the town gaols. The few soldiers of the 3rd Dragoon Guards left on the scene were powerless to stop them; the Bridewell Jail, Lawford's Gate Prison and Gloucester County Prison were overrun and the prisoners freed. Further destruction was inflicted upon houses, warehouses, tollhouses and civic buildings, particularly on Queen Square, Prince's Street and King Street. There was an attempt to attack the Bristol Corporation's dock company and the dock gates were burnt. Fires set at the Bishop's Palace, customs house, excise office and at other buildings were reportedly visible from Newport, Wales. Chants from the crowd included \\"Oh! It's only Corporation property!\\" to justify the destruction of civic buildings and \\"Down with the churches and mend the roads with them\\". It is known that a number of \\"fireballs\\" of flammable tow and pitch were manufactured for use by rioters; though otherwise they were armed only with improvised sticks, railings, and tools looted from blacksmiths.  31 October  The destruction caused during the night of 30/31 October, in which many private houses were attacked, shocked the citizens of the city. The middle classes were provoked into action and some 3,000 men reported for duty in the posse comitatus on the following morning. An additional 100 soldiers from the 14th Light Dragoons arrived in the city later that day. Their officer, Major Beckwith, and a war office liaison officer, Major Mackworth, took control of the situation, without regard for Brereton's seniority. They responded to a rush of rioters on the southern side of Queen Square with a charge by the 3rd Dragoon Guards that effectively quelled the riot. The posse comitatus had largely restored order across the city by the time General Sir Richard Downes Jackson arrived from London with several hundred soldiers to do so.  Aftermath  The riots were the worst in an English city since the 1780 Gordon Riots in London. The total death toll is unknown but twelve citizens are known to have been killed in clashes with the authorities; many other corpses were recovered later from within burned buildings. Historian Mark Harrison in 1988 estimated between 120 and 250 casualties from all parties. A large part of the city centre was destroyed and up to ¬£300,000 of damage caused. Bristol was governed by Jackson and his troops for four months. Many in parliament had no confidence in the local government under Pinney and set up a committee of enquiry to remove the Bristol magistrates from office, opposed by Melbourne, who claimed he lacked jurisdiction. Pinney was eventually brought to trial before the Court of King's Bench in October 1832 and acquitted. A contemporary depiction of the court-martial of Colonel Brereton Trials of the rioters were held in January 1832, 102 were tried and 31 were sentenced to death. One of the men sentenced to hang was a retired tradesman whose only crime was to shout encouragement to the rioters. He was singled out by the court for particular punishment because of the respectable position he held in society. Clemency was granted to all bar four of those sentenced to death after a petition of 10,000 names was presented, which included the names of people whose houses had been destroyed in the riot. Some 22 people were transported to Australia and 43 imprisoned. Captain Warrington of the 3rd Dragoon Guards was court-martialled and cashiered for failing to pass on a message to Brereton during the riot. The colonel himself was arraigned before a court-martial in January 1832. During the proceedings he offered to plead guilty to charges of failing to control the riot if the court agreed not to call any more witnesses. The court refused this request and Brereton committed suicide before a sentence could be passed. Both pro-reform and anti-reform activists blamed the other for the riots. Pro- reformers suspected the Tory aldermen of Bristol of wanting the riots to get out of hand to discredit the movement while the Tories blamed the Whig government of withholding troops from the city authorities. It was alleged that the riots were directed by an external party; allegations were made of French involvement (revolutionaries there had overthrown Charles X in July 1830) and of members of the Birmingham Political Union travelling to the city, but not substantiated. Reform campaigners, eager to avoid any political connection to the riot, claimed the rioters were all youths, the unemployed and \\"women of abandoned character\\" from St Philips and Lawford's Gate areas of the city. However court records show the rioters seem to have largely been men aged 20‚Äì40 from the Temple and St James districts. Only one of those convicted of rioting was unemployed, for example. Another common misconception of the time was that troublemakers had come from the Kingswood collieries; though the pit owners stated that their men had largely remained at work throughout the riots. No defendant claimed a political motive in court and many pleaded drunkenness as mitigation for their behaviour. The Third Reform Bill, known afterwards as the Great Reform Act, finally passed in 1832 after a political crisis known as the Days of May. The Royal Commission on Municipal Corporations of 1833 thought Bristol's local authority was jealous of its power and incapable of controlling the city; with many city officials viewing their positions as sinecures. The corporation was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Pinney returned to the corporation that year as an alderman, a position he held for 18 years. W. J.

He played baseball at Northwestern, and performed in musical groups affiliated with the college. Giebink continued his career as a student athlete on the golf team of the University of Minnesota, as he was accepted to the University of Minnesota School of Law in 1936. After one year, Giebink decided to study medicine. He earned a medical degree in 1942, from the University of Minnesota Medical School. He enlisted in the United States Army Reserve, completing an internship at Minneapolis General Hospital before receiving active duty status as a member of the United States Medical Corps. Originally assigned to an American military hospital in Paris, Giebink was soon transferred to the 120th Infantry Regiment. For actions during the Battle of the Bulge, Giebink was awarded the Bronze Star, an oak leaf cluster, and a Purple Heart. He was discharged in 1945, and began a medical residency. Giebink's residency in orthopedics lasted three years, and was split between Minneapolis General, Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Hospital, Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare, and Shriners Hospitals for Children in Minneapolis. In 1950, he cofounded what became known as the Park Nicollet Clinic. From 1953, Giebink operated a medical practice in Sioux Falls. He retired from medicine in the 1980s. Giebink helped establish the Sioux Vocational School for the Handicapped, later known as South Dakota Achieve, in the 1950s. He was also active in Dakotabilities, another advocacy organization for people with disabilities, as well as other civic service groups. A Republican, Giebink served in the South Dakota House of Representatives from 1969 until his resignation on May 21, 1971, after which he was replaced by David Vigen.

Property refers to legally protected claims to resources, such as land and personal property. Property can be exchanged through contract law, and if property is violated, one could sue under tort law to protect it. United States property law is primarily an area for state law, although there are also federal laws (for example, on patents and copyright) and some local laws involvement (on areas such as zoning and tenancy). Property law in the states generally originate from the common law and have been modified by statutes. The Restatements on Property gives an overview of certain areas of property law in the United States.  Theory of property rights  = Definition of property rights = There are two main views on the right to property in the United States, the traditional view and the bundle of rights view. The traditionalists believe that there is a core, inherent meaning in the concept of property, while the bundle of rights view states that the property owner only has bundle of permissible uses over the property. The two views exist on a spectrum and the difference may be a matter of focus and emphasis. William Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, wrote that the essential core of property is the right to exclude. That is, the owner of property must be able to exclude others from the thing in question, even though the right to exclude is subject to limitations. By implication, the owner can use the thing, unless another restriction, such as zoning law, prevents it. Other traditionalists argue that three main rights define property: the right to exclusion, use and transfer. An alternative view of property, favored by legal realists, is that property simply denotes a bundle of rights defined by law and social policy. Which rights are included in the bundle known as property rights, and which bundles are preferred to which others, is simply a matter of policy. Therefore, a government can prevent the building of a factory on a piece of law, through zoning law or criminal law, without damaging the concept of property. The \\"bundle of rights\\" view was prominent in academia in the 20th century and remains influential today in American law.  Acquisition of property  = First Possession = Under American law, the first possessor of a property generally acquires the property. The first possessor is the first person who intends to assert control over the object and in fact exercises significant control over the object. A seminal case on first possession is Pierson v. Post.3 Cai. R. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1805). Post was a hunter who was chasing a fox through a vacant land, when Pierson, knowing it was being chased by another, killed the fox and took it away. The issue before the court is whether Post exercised enough control over the fox, a wild animal, to become first possessor. The majority of the court cited the Justinian Code and various jurists, before concluding that possession required certain control. With wild animals, the majority held, only one who mortally wound or seize the animal can acquire possession, merely giving chase is not sufficient. The dissenting opinion would require only a reasonable prospect of capture, close pursuit in the case would satisfy the rule. The dissent cited jurists as well as the custom among hunters. The majority and the dissent also differs in their view of the policy implications of the ruling. The majority would prefer a clear rule, easy for all to understand and allowing individuals to settle disputes with that rule. The dissent raises the issue of incentives, arguing that the \\"reasonable prospect\\" rule would incentivize hunters to hunt foxes, which are considered pests. = Adverse possession = Theories of adverse possession are summarized in an article by Thomas W. Merrill.  Types of estates  = Estates and future interests = Land ownership in American law is highly complex, based on feudal categories inherited from English law. Although feudalism is no longer relevant in modern Unite States, the law in most states have not been simplified to reflect modern circumstances. However, new types of land ownership is generally disallowed, under the numerus clausus principle, unless they are introduced by legislation. In most states, full ownership of land is known as fee simple, fee simple absolute, or fee. Fee simple refers to a present interest in the land, which continues indefinitely into the future. One other type of ownership is the defeasible fee, which is like fee simple, except that it can end upon some event occurring. The defeasible fee is sometimes seen with property donated to charity for a specific use, where the grantor specifies that the ownership may end if the property is no longer used in a certain way. Another type of present interest is the life estate, by which the grantor gives the life tenant full rights during the life tenant's life. But after his death, the estate will either go back to the grantor (known as a reversion) or to another person (known as a remainder). Remainders can be vested or conditional, based on conditions of the remainder. Remainders are \\"vested\\" when the condition of the remainder is fulfilled, even if the possession has not yet been transferred. For example, in a grant \\"to A for life, then to B if he graduates high school by age 18\\", the remainder to B vests when B graduates high school by age 18, although the possession will not transfer until A dies. There is also the executory interest, which is a future interest that cuts off a preceding interest when a condition is met. The focus on vesting is important in many states because contingent remainders (and certain other future interests) are invalidated if they might vest after the period defined by the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP). The Rule Against Perpetuities traditionally requires an interest to vest \\"if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.\\"John Chipman Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities ¬ß201 (Roland Gray ed., 4th ed. 1942). Any future interest not conforming to the Rule Against Perpetuities is traditionally invalid. Many states have reformed the RAP with \\"wait-and-see statutes\\" or abolished it all together. = Co-ownership = Under the common law, real estate can be jointly owned at a given time. In most states, in a tenancy in common, co-tenants each have a theoretical right to possess the whole property. Co-tenants must also share rents received from third-parties, as well as upkeep expenses and taxes. However, if they cannot work out how to divide the use of the property, one co-tenant can prevent another from taking possession, but must be liable to the ousted tenant for the rent.

He worked on fate maps in Drosophila imaginal discs and was noted for his experimental skills and teaching. Hadorn was born in the family of farmers in Forst in Bernese Oberland. Even as a child he was interested in the development of frogs from their eggs each summer. He worked as a teacher in a local village and earned enough money to study biology at the University of Berne under Fritz Baltzer studying nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. He received a PhD in 1931 and began to teach graduate students. He began to conduct research in his basement on amphibia and with Baltzer's encouragement he applied for a Rockefeller fellowship and went to Rochester University and met Curt Sturn and began to work with Drosophila. He returned to Switzerland and later joined the University of Zurich where he worked until 1972. His research included mechanisms of gene expression and regulation, especially with experiments on mosaic genomes, with the experimental introduction of a foreign genome into a cell. One of his experiments was on the mutant Drosophila that had larvae that did not turn into pupae due to a defective hormone function. In 1955 he published Developmental Genetics and Lethal Factors which was translated to English in 1961. This earned him the Marcel Benoist Prize. His other major work was on imaginal discs begun in 1945 and he worked out the fate of different regions producing \\"fate maps\\" using experiments with transplanting tissues and studying transdetermination. Hadorn was known for his enthusiasm in teaching and conducted intense workshops. In his spare time he took an interest in birdwatching. Hadorn was one of the founders of the journal Developmental Biology. He died at Wohlen near Bern.

Emma emigrated with her parents Carl August Sobels and Johanna Wilhelmine Sobels, n√©e Diemann, six brothers and a sister aboard Hermann von Beckerath from Bremen in December 1847. Minna received early training from Moritz Heuzenroeder and Fred Ellard of Adelaide and Lucy Chambers of Melbourne. At age 16 she joined the Italian Opera Company, which toured New Zealand and Australia and undertaking further study in Germany, she performed concerts in London and elsewhere. In 1877 she was a member of Mme Simonsen's opera company touring Wallace's opera Maritana as \\"Wanda\\", Charles Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot in the dual roles of \\"Babet\\" and \\"Herailie\\", Carlo Broschi (Baildon's adaptation of Auber's La part du diable) as \\"Casilda\\", Lecoq's Girofl√©-Girofla as \\"Pedro\\", Bellini's La Sonnambula as \\"Lisa\\", Flotow's Martha, Harris's Satanella, The Hermit's Bell (Baildon's translation from Maillart's Les dragons de Villars), as \\"Georgette\\", all supporting roles, but to glowing reviews.

Lewis in July 1878, and Fischer was in the cast of the first production, Oxygen by Farnie and Reece. She was well received in several burlesques at the Adelaide Theatre Royal, but apart from an appearance at the Liedertafel made few further performances in 1878. On 28 May 1879 she married the celebrated Australian actor Herbert Flemming in Melbourne and had two sons before they had a major disagreement and separated.

According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 8,272 people.  Geography  Kalasungay is located 3 km west of the city proper. It is bounded to the north by the Tugisan and Tagoloan rivers, separating it from Impalutao and Manalog, respectively. It is bounded to the east by Sumpong and Impalambong; to the south by Casisang and Imbayao; to the southwest by Capitan Angel; and to the west by Dalwangan and Patpat by the Sawaga River and Kabakahan Creek, respectively. It is subdivided into eight purok. The Sawaga River bisects Kalasungay into a hilly and forested northern half and a gently rising southern half which touches the foothills of the Kitanglad Mountain Range. The forests of northern Kalasungay is a project of the Bukidnon Forests, Incorporated in a consortium with the New Zealand government. The southern half is classified as agricultural land.  Socio-economic profile  According to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan of the city government, Kalasungay is planned as an agricultural and industrial zone aimed to \\"limit the expansion of poultries [sic] and piggeries\\". Areas along the Sayre Highway are dedicated for commercial and residential purposes. Agriculture is the major source of livelihood of the people. Corn, sugarcane, coffee, pineapple, and vegetables are the primary crops produced. Poultry and hog farms are located throughout the outskirts of the village, which also provide employment to the locals. Due to its proximity to the Poblacion District, commerce is a growing activity. A significant fraction of the population is employed in the service sector. Kalasungay has a well-maintained road network leading into and out of the barangay, with the Sayre Highway as a major thoroughfare. A new by- pass road from San Jose to Dalwangan aimed to divert traffic to avoid congestion in Poblacion District passes by Kalasungay in Sitio Karangkarang. Kalasungay has one public elementary school and one high school, all of them administered by the Department of Education, Division of Malaybalay City District I. These are Kalasungay Central School and Kalasungay National High School.  History  Map of Misamis in 1899, showing barrio Calasungay. According to the accepted historical narrative of Kalasungay, the Higaonon people started to occupy the Lumayagan Creek in northern Kalasungay from the Tagoloan River around the time of the Spanish occupation of Mindanao.. The community was then called Galnarah√°n, which means \\"a place of pomelo (garnada)\\" in Binukid, due to the abundance of pomelo in the area. The word garnada came from Spanish granada, which means pomegranate, a fruit that looks similar to pomelo as far as the Higaonon were concerned. Galnarah√°n was closely associated with Sil-ipen, an old name for Dalwangan In one event, two carabao bulls were locking horns and in an effort to separate them, the village chieftain was fatally gored. The phrase \\"Kalabaw nagsungay!\\" (Binukid: The carabao gored him!) was purportedly said by the witnesses about the event to other villagers. The phrase was then corrupted into kala-sungay, which has been used to describe the area where the event occurred and eventually included Galnarah√°n altogether. These events are anecdotal, and no further reference supports or refutes the narrative. In the early 19th century, the Spaniards had had contact with the natives in Kalasungay, and eventually incorporated the village as part of the province of Misamis in 1845.. In 1850, Kalasungay was reportedly burned down in a skirmish between the natives and the Spaniards. In the narrative published in the website of the city of Malaybalay, the Spaniards burned down the village in a battle against the natives, even going as far as to claim there are atrocities committed. However, the historical narrative presented in the 2015 Citizen's Charter published by the city government stated that Kalasungay was burned down by the natives themselves as a result of an earlier atrocity in 1845; furthermore, it stated that there was no open warfare. In 15 June 1877, Kalasungay was integrated into Oroquieta del Interior, a pueblo encompassing the present-day Bukidnon province.

She is often considered to be Poland's first female philosopher. She wrote Thoughts on the Education of Women, and edited the journal Pielgrzym (Pilgrim). She has been described as a \\"anti-Hegelian\\" and a conservative. She was born on a manor in Jasieniec which belonged to the Okƒôcki family where her father was employed as an administrator. She was educated by her grandmother, also Eleonor, who emphasized readings of contemporary romantic poets such as Adam Mickiewicz, J√≥zef Bohdan Zalewski and Franciszek Karpi≈Ñski. She published her first poems at eleven years old in 1830, in a magazine for children (Dziennik dla Dzieci), edited by Stanis≈Çaw Jachowicz. Subsequently, she began contributing regularly to various periodicals, such as Tygodnik Polski, Magazyn Powszechny and Pierwiosnka, publishing literary works (short stories, fairy tales) and editorials. She married Antoni Ziemiecki in 1834 and together with her husband left for Dresden where they lived until 1840. The family then moved to Warsaw. Anti-Hegelism After moving to Warsaw she became interested in philosophy, including the works of John Locke, √âtienne de Condillac and French spiritualists, then that of German philosophers, including Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Friedrich Hegel. She made references to these philosophers in her travelogues published in Pierwiosnek. Ziemiecka became associated with conservative Polish intelligentsia of Congress Poland who opposed the growing influence of Hegelism, seeing it as a threat to traditional values and social order. In particular she was became close to the circle of traditionalist Catholic publicists with ties to the magazine Tygodnik Petersburski (Petersburg Weekly), which included Henryk Rzewuski, bishop Ignacy Ho≈Çowi≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Cho≈Çoniewski and Micha≈Ç Grabowski (so called \\"Petersburg clique\\"). Although Ziemiecka herself never became part of the circle and never published in the Tygodnik, these individuals supporter her intellectual efforts. Ziemiecka objected to the clique's servile attitude towards Russia and she saw their traditionalism as extreme. Instead, she wanted to synthesize new intellectual currents with traditional religious values. As a result of the Petersburg connection Ziemiecka became fascinated with the philosophy of Friedrich Hegel and undertook to develop a critique of then current German philosophy, in particular its pantheistic aspects. This led to her first major philosophical work, My≈õli o filozofii (Philosophical Thoughts), published in 1841. In it, she criticized Hegel and attempted to defend the autonomy of religious beliefs. On the other hand, she regarded the philosophy of Immanuel Kant in a positive light. Although this book established Ziemiecka as the first female Polish philosopher, at the time it was widely criticized by other philosophers such as Bronis≈Çaw Trentowski, Edward Dembowski, and Fryderyk Henryk Lewestam. Trentowski in particular wrote in response to her work that women had no business engaging in philosophy. In 1842 Ziemiecka founded a conservative- Catholic monthly journal Pielgrzym (Pilgrim) where she published literary, philosophical and political essays, as well as translations of French religious works. Despite support from important literary figures like J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, the journal never acquired wide readership and Ziemiecka closed it down in 1846. Women's Issues Ziemiecka also focused on role of women in society and in particular on women's education. In 1842 she met Narcyza ≈ªmichowska, a young author who had recently made her publishing debut in Pierwiosnek. ≈ªmichowska was influenced by Ziemiecka, who published a number of her literary pieces in the Pielgrzym. During this time the journal became one of the main publications which focused on women's issues. In 1843 Ziemiecka published My≈õli o wychowaniu kobiet (Thoughts on the Education of Women) in which she covered the traditional calls for cultivating morality and character, but also made novel for the time appeals for providing young women with a modern education. In her opinion, a reform was needed in the sphere of women's education and upbringing, which would focus on both emotional and intellectual aspects. At the same time she also criticized romance novels, as in her view these overstimulated the imagination, were too emotional, and led to detachment from reality which resulted in family strife and failures in life.

Adopted as an infant, Bowman was raised by her adoptive father, Dennis Bowman. At age 14, she accused him of molesting her. A short time after this incident, Bowman vanished from her family's rural property. Dennis claimed she had stolen money from her adopters before running away. She remained a missing person for over 30 years, and her case was classified as a runaway. In November 2019, Dennis Bowman was arrested for the September 1980 murder of Kathleen Doyle in extradited to Virginia in February 2020 to face charges in Doyle's murder, and in May 2020, was charged with Aundria M Bowman's murder. Bowman's case has received national media attention, including coverage by Inside Edition and Oxygen. In 1993, she was one of several missing children whose photographs were shown in the music video for the Soul Asylum song \\"Runaway Train\\". Background Bowman was born Alexis Miranda Badger on June 23, 1974 in New Orleans, Louisiana. At five months old, she was placed for adoption by her biological mother, Cathy Terkanian, and, after a period in foster care, was adopted by the Bowman family of Michigan at 21 months old, and renamed Aundria. Disappearance In late 1988, Bowman raised concerns with staff at her high school when she expressed fearfulness of going home from school. Staff at the school involved police, who interviewed Bowman, during which she claimed that Dennis was molesting her. A social worker returned Bowman to her family's residence, and confronted them about Bowman's allegations; Dennis and his then-wife both refused the allegations, claiming that the Bowman's rebelliousness had been sparked by her family's recent disclosure that she had been adopted as an infant. Shortly after this incident, the Bowmans relocated to a mobile home in a rural area of Allegan County. This was the last place Bowman was seen. When her family reported her missing, Dennis claimed she had stolen money from him before running away. Bowman's case was classified as an \\"endangered runaway.\\" Investigation Following the reporting of Aundria as missing, her family relocated from the property where they had resided. In the intervening months, Bowman's adoptive mother made several calls to police in which she stated she had been told of numerous sightings of Bowman, though these could not be substantiated. Dennis Bowman's criminal record at the time of Aundria's disappearance was notable: In 1980, he was arrested after a young woman claimed he attempted to lure and assault her in a wooded area in western Michigan. He pleaded guilty to the assault after working out a deal with prosecutors. In 1993, Bowman's photograph was shown in the music video for the Soul Asylum song \\"Runaway Train\\" (1993), among other missing children. Facial reconstruction of Racine County Jane Doe, initially thought to be Bowman, but later proven via DNA profiling to be Peggy Johnson In 1998, Bowman was arrested for breaking and entering the home of a coworker in Ottawa County to steal items, including the woman's lingerie. Before his sentencing in the case, Bowman referenced his missing daughter, Aundria, in a letter to the presiding judge: \\"I am the father of two lovely daughters, one 25 and the other 11, and feel that being a parent is one of the most important and sobering things a person can undertake.\\" A Jane Doe discovered in a Wisconsin corn field in 1999, later determined to be Peggy Johnson, was suspected to potentially be Bowman due to a notable resemblance. However, Bowman was ruled out as a possibility through DNA profiling provided by her biological mother, Cathy. Later developments =Arrest of Dennis Bowman= Bowman's adoptive father, Dennis, was arrested in November 2019 for the unsolved homicide of 25-year-old Kathleen Doyle in Norfolk, Virginia, which occurred on September 21, 1980. During this time, Dennis had been in the midst of the court proceedings for his breaking-and-entering of his coworker's home, though he was unable to attend court hearings for a two-week period in September 1980, claiming he was a member of the United States Army and was required to attend a two-week summer camp. =Confession and recovery of remains= In early February 2020, it was reported the Dennis Bowman, incarcerated while pending trial for the murder of Kathleen Doyle, confessed to police that he had murdered his adopted daughter, Aundria. Several days later, it was announced that skeletal remains had been recovered at 200 block of 136th Avenue of Monterey Township (near the home of Bowman) in Allegan County, concealed by a thin layer of cement. On February 9, 2020, Dennis Bowman was extradited to Virginia to face charges in Doyle's murder. It was subsequently confirmed via DNA that the remains were in fact Aundria Bowman. On May 15, 2020, Dennis Bowman was charged with the murder of Aundria.

Philanthropy  After the death of her husband in 1900, Sladen was determined that his collection would be available for the public and endowed a new gallery and curatorial position at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. She also endowed the Percy Sladen Memorial Trust in 1904 to provide funding for fieldwork for biologists and geologists around the world. Sladen died at Northbrook Park on 17 January 1906, an attack of influenza the previous year meant her health had declined. She died, according to the Linnean Society of an \\"obscure disease\\" after some months of illness. She is buried with her husband in the graveyard at St Luke's Church in Exeter.  Legacy  After her death, Sladen was described as \\"a great benefactor of science\\" by the Linnean Society.Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London. (One Hundred and Eighteenth Session, 1905‚Äê1906.) 2 November 1905, to 21 June 1906.

He began with the intention of becoming a goldsmith as well; serving an apprenticeship with his father from 1892 to 1832. That year, the Goldsmith's Guild promoted him to Journeyman. Two years later, aged only twenty, he achieved the status of Master. Shortly after, he went to Vienna to sharpen his skills, but his exposure to the cosmopolitanism there diverted his attention to a different kind of artistic endeavor. In 1835, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts. His teachers there included the portraitist, , Johann Nepomuk Ender, Leopold Kupelwieser (a friend of Franz Schubert), and the landscape painter, Joseph M√∂ssmer. His first paintings were mostly landscapes and vedute. After 1845, he was able to continue his studies with the assistance of a patron; Count . View of Bansk√° Bystrica from the East He loved to travel and created several lithographic albums of his travels throughout Europe. His first exhibition came in 1840, with views of Budapest. In 1848, he published a book with views of Bad Ischl and, the following year, one of Salzburg with scenes of the Salzkammergut region. From 1849 to 1850, he travelled from Bavaria to Southern Italy; painting views for Archduke John of Austria. A trip to Egypt from 1855 to 1856 resulted in an album of 45 color lithographs, for which he received an award from Alexander von Humboldt in 1857. A planned trip to the Americas was never realized, due to Von Humboldt's death. His first lithographs of his hometown appeared in 1852, when he made a lengthy return visit. Five years later, he returned again and focused on drawing castles; notably at Orava and Zvolen. During his visit in 1883, he also made sketches in Sklen√© Teplice and ≈†trbsk√© Pleso. His last visits came in 1884 and 1886, when he made sketches on Mount Urp√≠n. His last drawings were made in Salzburg, in 1887. On Christmas Eve, he always gave clothing and shoes to poor children. He left a ten-page will, which included a large donation to the Evangelical Elementary School in Bansk√° Bystrica. Single and childless, he was given a modest funeral and, per his wishes, his heart was pierced. His original works may be seen at the Slovak National Gallery, the , the East Slovak Museum, the Albertina and the Hungarian National Gallery.

It was staffed by French Orientalists, ethnographers and intelligence officers who specialized in indigenous affairs in an effort to help administer the new colony. The bureaux arabes had a significant influence on the formulation of French policy, driven by colonial beliefs of being part of a civilizing mission where offers saw themselves as an elite bringing modernity to Muslim Algerians and their society. Being well embedded with the locals, the bureaus also served as an intelligence collection operation for the army. Described by Ramzi Rouighi as the \\"public face of the military pacification of the natives\\", the bureaux arabes subjected Algerians to \\"a constant regime of both euphemised and overt violence...which endured for a century thereafter\\", as James McDougall writes in A History of Algeria (2017). Eug√®ne Daumas was a notable officer who served in the Bureaux arabes in the 1830s. He was promoted to the rank of general, and was made director of Algerian affairs in the Ministry of War after April 1850.

At the age of 20, Nag co-founded Stem Cell Theranostics which uses patient-specific stem cells in a drug discovery platform. Nag is also the founder of StartX Med, Stanford University‚Äôs student healthcare accelerator program. At Apple, Nag leads a team designing tools that help ease communication between healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients to guide scientific innovation and improve health outcomes.  Early life and education  Nag was born in California and grew up in El Dorado County. Her parents immigrated to the United States from Jaipur, India before she was born. Nag's father, Harish Nag, is a software programmer at Intel, and he taught her from a young age to surround herself with people that are better than her. Nag attended Rolling Hills Middle School where she was the student body president. At age 13, Nag she became the youngest student ever to enter Folsom Lake College. With a desire to learn more and better herself, Nag then pursued high school at Mira Loma High School in Sacramento where she could partake in the International Baccalaureate Program. During her time at Mira Loma, Nag had a desire to work alongside scientists. She contacted many scientists at the University of California, Davis and secured an internship as a high school student in the lab of Alexandra Navrotsky where she explored the use of nanoparticles in the prevention of forest fires, like the ones that were ravaging her hometown at the time. Her work elucidated that addition of quartz to soil would increase the temperature threshold for fires to start and now quartz is being added to prevent accidental fires in campgrounds. Nag was accepted to Stanford University in 2009 and pursued her undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering and Medical Anthropology. She immediately started research in the lab of Joseph Wu studying stem cells, their induction, and their potential use in transplantation. She also explored various aspects of cardiovascular disease. Within one year she had dozens of publications and had begun to work alongside Wu and two other Stanford professors, Andrew S. Lee and Robert C. Robbins to create a drug testing platform where rapid assessment of the efficacy of drugs on human heart tissue could be tested to expedite both drug discovery and patient treatment. They founded the company Stem Cell Theranostics in 2011 to begin to put their ideas to use in the healthcare sphere. One year later, Nag founded StartX Med, a spin-off of the accelerator program StartX at Stanford in order to help students like herself begin the process of biotechnology innovation and healthcare entrepreneurship. By 2012, Nag was heavily involved in both Stem Cell Theranostics and StartX Med so she decided to discontinue her studies at Stanford to lead her company and organization at the age of 20.  Career and research  = Stem Cell Theranostics = Nag co-founded Stem Cell Theranostics in 2011. Stem Cell Theranostics is a biotechnology company that pioneered the use of skin cell derived stem cells to use in drug discovery platforms. Specifically, they would take skin cells and convert them to stem cells and then re-differentiate them into heart cells through the addition of transcription factors. Since the heart cells, now being grown in a dish, are derived from a patient, they contain genetic profile and thus drugs can be tested in a patient specific manner. The motivation behind Nag's company lies in the fact that most drugs do not make it to the final stages of clinical trials due to cardiovascular effects and further, most drugs that are recalled after passing the final stages, are recalled due to negative effects on the cardiovascular system. Nag wanted a cheap and fast way to test the effects of a drug on human cells, instead of in mice, so speed up the drug discovery process and bring harmless and specific treatments to patients as quickly as possible. When they tested their technology on drugs that had been recalled due to cardiovascular effects, they found that their platform identified dangerous or harmful drugs 100% of the time. = StartX Med = Nag founded StartX Med, a spin-off of StartX, at Stanford University in 2012. StartX Med is an organization that supports students in their path towards innovating and developing healthcare based startup companies through Stanford. She was inspired by her own experiences starting Stem Cell Theranostics as she saw added hurdles in starting a healthcare startup compared to the typical technology startup that StartX supported. She wanted to help students navigate their way through finding laboratories and FDA approval as she had to for her company as well as create a collaborative environment for students interested in starting companies in the healthcare sector. StartX Med has now helped over 100 health technology companies, raised over $100 million in aggregate, and partnered with top 10 pharmaceutical companies to bring ideas into practice. = Career at Apple = In 2014, Nag was recruited to work at Apple in the Special Projects unit to innovate novel ways to make healthcare data easily usable by both patients and researchers. She leads a team that created ResearchKit, which is an app based tool that enables collection of health data from any user with a smartphone thus allowing researchers to broaden their subject and patient pools to expedite discovery and translation in medicine. The app allows doctors to alter patients to follow their prescribed treatment plans and also allows patients to provide updates to physicians. The app also allows patients to track their health and disease conditions in novel ways.

Mark Terry is a Canadian scholar, explorer, and filmmaker. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and teaches at the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change, York University and the Faculty of Arts, Wilfrid Laurier University. Education He received his PhD from York University in Toronto defending his dissertation titled The Geo-Doc: Remediating the Documentary Film as an Instrument of Social Change on January 18, 2019. Career In 2009, Terry produced and directed the documentary feature film The Antarctica Challenge: A Global Warning (2009) and was invited to screen it at COP15, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen that year. The film was screened 25 times at the two-week conference and viewed online 60,000 times by delegates. The screenings established a relationship with Terry and the Communications Department of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that continues to this day. He was asked to produce a second film on Arctic research for the subsequent climate summit, COP16 in Cancun. The film he made was called The Polar Explorer (2010) and profiled the research team from ArcticNet during a crossing of the Northwest Passage, the first film to document a complete crossing. The film was once again screened 25 times at the conference and was included in a policy-writing session as a resource. The resulting resolution - Enhanced Action on Adaptation: Section II, Subsection 25 of the Cancun Accord - was co-authored by Terry. While the medium of the documentary film was welcomed as a communications tool by the UN, a demand for more visible evidence of climate change was made. To accommodate this, Terry conceived of the Geo-Doc to provide multiple documentary shorts of climate research from around the world on one digital map. The project was an extension of the Youth Climate Report, a curation project conceived by Terry and Toronto-based lawyer John Kelly in 2011. The project called for the global community of youth to produce short video films of climate research in their home countries. From 2011 to 2015, the best films were edited together to create a feature-length documentary film that was screened for delegates attending the annual UN climate summits. In 2015, the Geo-Doc format was introduced at the Paris climate summit. It was adopted by the UNFCCC the following year as a partner program to showcase the best videos submitted to the Global Youth Video Competition. The Youth Climate Report GIS Project continues to this day. =Filmography= Mark Terry has contributed to 66 film and television productions as a producer, director, writer, publicist, actor, and even stunt driver.

It is a Scheduled Monument. History The village is mentioned, as Ultone, in the Domesday Book of 1086. In 1165 the settlement was part of the Barony of FitzAlan, and for several generations was held by the descendants of Alan de Upton. In the late 14th century the Cressetts, through marriage, succeeded to the title of Lord of Upton. St Michael's Church and Upton Cressett Hall, both Grade I listed buildings, are adjacent to the site. The church, dating from the 12th century, is thought to be on the site of a Saxon church, from which some material may have been re- used for the later building. The hall, mostly of the 15th century, is thought to be on the site of an earlier moated house. The desertion of the village may relate to the creation of a deer park. In 1517, in Thomas Wolsey's Inquisition of Enclosures, Upton Cressett Park is first mentioned: it was alleged that Thomas Cressett had emparked 40 acres of arable land. A 1647 map of Upton Cressett shows that the site of the settlement is within the park. Earthworks The site, of area , is east of the church and hall. It is bisected by the former main street of the settlement, a substantial feature running south-east. Most of the earthworks are to the south-west of this: there are three or more house platforms alongside the street, and other linear features on this side, which were perhaps paddocks or other enclosures. In the south-east of the site, there is a less distinct former street, at right- angles to the main street. Building platforms can be discerned alongside, including a large platform about by , perhaps a barn.

ESET researchers found various versions of the malware, and believe that in May 2020 it was still under development. They numbered the versions Ramsay Version 1, Ramsay Version 2a and Ramsay Version 2b. The very first encounter with the malware was a sample that was uploaded from Japan to VirusTotal. The first version was compiled in September 2019. The last version that they found was most advanced. The discovery of Ramsay was seen as significant as malware is rarely able to target physically isolated devices. Authorship While authorship has not been attributed, it has many common artefacts with Retro, a backdoor by hacking entity Darkhotel believed to operate in the interests of South Korea. Workings of the malware The three versions of Ramsay that ESET found have different workings. Ramsay version 1 does not include a rootkit, whilst the later versions do.

From 1990 to 1997 he was rector of the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig.  Life  Born in Chemnitz Thiele was born the son of a craftsman. Already at the age of twelve he created his first compositions. He had music lessons with Werner H√ºbschmann and Gustav William Meyer and took part in the studio choir of the Volksb√ºhne Chemnitz, directed by . After his Abitur in 1952 at the Thiele studied musical composition with Wilhelm Weismann and Johannes Weyrauch from 1953 to 1958, conducting with Franz Jung and Heinz R√∂gner and piano with Rudolf Fischer and Amadeus Webersinke at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig. From 1958 to 1962 he was teacher as well as choir and orchestra conductor at the music schools in Radeberg and Wurzen. From 1959 he performed his chamber music, symphonic and choral symphonic works at home and abroad. Since that time he has also been active in the Leipzig congregation of The Christian Community as a musician and composer for liturgical and other works. From 1960 to 1962 Thiele studied composition with Leo Spies at the Academy of Arts, Berlin.

Among his students were Bernd Franke, Walter Thomas Heyn, Thomas Reuter, Reinhard Pfundt and Steffen Schleiermacher. On the occasion of the opening of the Neues Gewandhaus zu Leipzig on 8 October 1981, Thiele created the great commissioned work Ges√§nge an die Sonne for alto and tenor solo, organ, choir and orchestra. It was premiered in the opening concert under the direction of the then Gewandhaus Kapellmeister Kurt Masur, who wanted the new large organ of the Gewandhaus to be appropriately included in this composition. Thiele took the texts from the Prolog im Himmel from Goethe's Faust, Schiller's poem An die Sonne and H√∂lderlin's Dem Sonnengott. Only after Masur's intervention was this play allowed to be performed at all at the opening, since the Zentralkomitee der SED did not like the texts.Thiele, Siegfried on Grove Music Online On 1 October 1990 Thiele took office as the newly elected Rector of the Academy of Music and Theatre in Leipzig.

The building, which is the headquarters of Wandsworth London Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building. History In the mid-19th century Wandsworth Vestry met in the vestry room of All Saints Church. After civic leaders found this arrangement was inadequate, they decided to procure a purpose-built vestry hall: the site selected was a row of properties in the High Street. The new building was designed by George Patrick in a mixture of the Italianate and French Renaissance styles, built by Mr Parsons of Wandsworth and completed in 1882. It went on to become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth as \\"Wandsworth Town Hall\\" in 1900. A modest two-storey structure faced in red-brick over channeled stone, designed by Ernest Elford in the Classical style, and now known as the \\"civic suite\\", was erected in the High Street to the east of the vestry hall in 1927. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with eleven bays facing onto the High Street; the left section of two bays featured a canopied doorway on the ground floor with a pediment containing the borough coat of arms above; there was a row of round-headed windows interspersed with Doric order pilasters on the first floor. A projecting clock was erected on the outside of the building. This was followed by a huge stone facility to the east on the corner of the High Street and Fairfield Street, designed by Edward A. Hunt in the International Moderne style, built by Dove Brothers of Islington and originally known as the \\"municipal buildings\\". The corner section of Hunt's building featured a vehicle entrance leading to a central courtyard at ground level; there was a Vitruvian scroll bearing the borough coat of arms with five tall windows on the first floor; the corner section connected two blocks each of which had finials on the roof. The High Street facade of Hunt's building, which extended to 15 bays, was embellished by a frieze, carved by David Evans and John Linehan, depicting local historical scenes. The municipal buildings were officially opened by Queen Mary on 14 July 1937. The principal room was a polygon-shaped council chamber which projected from the rear of the building. The complex continued to function as the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Wandsworth was formed in 1965. The original vestry hall, which had suffered considerable damage during the Blitz in the Second World War, was demolished in the 1970s to make way for a modern office block designed by Culpin and Partners, located to the west the civic suite, which was completed in 1975. Princess Alexandra opened a new borough register office in the town hall in 1993 and returned to attend a citizenship ceremony the council chamber in May 2012.

It shows the New Pipe Plant Pervouralsk. Thomas Kellner (born May 28, 1966) in Bonn) is a German fine-art photographer, lecturer and curator. He became known above all for his large-format photographs of famous architectural monuments, which, through many individual images and a shifted camera perspective, look like \\"photo mosaics\\".  Life  From 1989 to 1996, Kellner studied Art and Social science at the University of Siegen to become a teacher. At the chair of Professor J√ºrgen K√∂nigs, a genuine \\"school of pinhole camera photography\\" developed at the University of Siegen's Department of Art, Kellner intensively studied the possibilities and limits of this technique. At the same time he experimented with other methods of photography such as Salt- paper prints and Cyanotype. He also worked with various noble printing processes such as silver gelatine and Gum bichromate. In 1996, Kellner was awarded the Kodak Young Talent Award. In 2003 and 2004 he was a visiting professor for Fine-art photography at the University of Giessen. In 2012 he held a teaching position for photography at the Paderborn University. In 2004 Kellner initiated the project Photographers:Network in his hometown, an annual exhibition curated by him with changing themes and international artists. In 2013, the network's last exhibition took place in his studio in Siegen with the tenth exhibition. For this exhibition Kellner had selected works by 18 artists from seven countries and three continents. Starting in 2005, the artist traveled to Brazil several times to take photographs as part of his commission to represent architectural monuments in Brasilia. In 2010 the photos were shown in Brasilia on the occasion of Brasilia's 50th anniversary.\\" In 2006 Thomas Kellner undertook extensive travels to the United States, Latin America, Syria and China, where he photographed famous monuments such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Boston Athenaeum, and the Great Wall of China in his special technique. In 2010 he designed a photo project together with pupils from the Gesamtschule Gie√üen-Ost, which theme was the Telecommunications bunker in Gie√üen. The project was financially supported by the city of Giessen as part of the competition Stadt der jungen Forscher (City of young researchers). The focus of the students' photographic‚Äìartistic work on the bunker was to use Kellner's methodology of deconstructing buildings and reconstructing them in his photographs \\"as a procedure and transforming it to the conditions on site\\" (in German \\"als Verfahren aufzunehmen und auf die Gegebenheiten vor Ort zu transformieren). For this purpose, categories for working with and on the individual components were developed in cooperation with the pupils and topic areas were formulated. Afterwards, the pupils photographed the individual areas with their cameras. The resulting photos were compiled into collages and PowerPoint presentations: \\"Through the segmentation and subsequent recombination of the different perspectives, a comprehensive and new, but also critical picture of the former bunker complex and the current headquarters of the Musik- und Kunstverein was created[...] The students found the aesthetic examination of National Socialism in a place that is itself a cultural-historical testimony, both haunting and moving.\\" (in German \\"Durch die Segmentierung und anschlie√üende Neukombination der unterschiedlichen Perspektiven entstand ein umfassendes und neues, aber auch kritisches Bild von der ehemaligen Bunkeranlage und vom heutigen Sitz des Musik- und Kunstvereins.[...] Die √§sthetische Auseinandersetzung mit dem Nationalsozialismus an einem Ort, der selbst ein kulturhistorisches Zeugnis ist, empfanden die Sch√ºlerinnen und Sch√ºler als eindringlich und bewegend\\"). In 2012 Thomas Kellner travelled to Russia on behalf of RWE to work in Ekaterinburg and Perm to photograph industrial architecture (Genius Loci). Both cities were founded by Georg Wilhelm de Gennin from Siegen. Gennin was invited by Peter the Great in the 18th century on account of his expertise to promote the economy of the Urals and mining in the region. The factories he founded processed steel and metal. Kellner photographed not only on site in Russia, but also in the surrounding area of Siegen to capture the connection between the two regions in the processing of steel and metal. Since 2004 Thomas Kellner is a member of the German Society for Photography (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Photographie, DGPh). Kellner lives and works in Siegen.  Photographic technique  Thomas Kellner works with a single-lens reflex camera and uses 35mm film small image rolls. Each picture has a dimension of 24 √ó 36 millimetres. Each roll of film consists of 36 individual frames. In order to transport the film, perforations are made at the top and bottom of each frame, on which both the type of film used and the number of each frame are noted. After developing the film, Kellner cuts it into strips of equal length and assembles them into one large negative. This is then used to produce the contact sheet, on which the meta-information about the film and the respective number of the shot is still visible. Usually photographers use the contact sheet to make a selection of the photographed individual images, which are then enlarged. Normally it is never part of the finished photographs. The material as the carrier of the image information remains invisible. But Kellner allows for the information to still be visible on the film in his finished photographs. On the one hand, this info separates the individual images from one another, thus creating a rhythm and structure of the photographed object, and on the other hand, the viewer thus can follow the artist's working process: \\"The materiality in photography is treated quite rarely, unlike all other genres such as in painting, sculpture, graphics, etc. Today we always discuss the style, the chosen material itself, such as pigments, canvas, stone, etc. In photography, which is strongly mediatized, everyone tends to look only at the window of the Renaissance, at the object depicted, at most the composition or authorship behind it. Rarely is the chosen photographic paper, its surface, its pigments, or its grain or meaning of the pixels negotiated. This would, however, have been necessary long ago in view of the inclusion of photography in art according to contemporary criteria. [...] The chosen material, the characteristic style of the photographic process should be part of the author's decision and be an indispensable part of the picture's message.\\" (in German \\"Die Materialit√§t in der Fotografie wird recht selten behandelt, im Unterschied zu allen anderen Genres. In der Malerei, in Bildhauerei, in der Grafik, etc. Immer diskutieren wir heute den Duktus, das gew√§hlte Material an sich, wie die Pigmente, die Leinwand, den Stein, etc. In der Fotografie, die stark medialisiert ist tendieren alle immer dazu nur das Fenster der Renaissance zu betrachten, den abgebildeten Gegenstand, maximal die Komposition oder die Autorenschaft dahinter. Seltenst wird √ºber das gew√§hlte Fotopapier, seine Oberfl√§che, seine Pigmente, oder sein Korn, bzw. Bedeutung der Pixel verhandelt. Dies w√§re allerdings mit R√ºcksicht der Einbeziehung der Fotografie in die Kunst nach zeitgen√∂ssischen Kriterien l√§ngst notwendig. [...] Das gew√§hlte Material, der Duktus des fotografischen Prozesses sollte mit zur Entscheidung des Autors geh√∂ren und zur Bildaussage unabdingbar hinzugeh√∂ren.\\" When Kellner takes on a project, he makes sketches beforehand by dividing the object to be photographed into square sections and noting the planned camera settings for each section. When actually photographing the object, there can be several hours between the first and the last picture of a roll, because Kellner takes his photographs in chronological order, one after the other. Whereas Kellner used to work with only one roll of film in the beginning ‚Äì with the finished photograph consisting of only 36 individual 35mm images - he now uses up to 60 rolls of film. For his photograph of the Grand Canyon, 2160 individual pictures were thus created, and with them 2160 different views of the natural wonder, which he then assembled into a single photo with a length of 5 meters.  Effect of the pictures  The first photograph Kellner created with this technique was an image of the Eiffel Tower (1997), which he conceived as a homage to the Cubist artist Robert Delaunay. Delauney was very fascinated by what was then the highest building in the world and dedicated much of his work to its depiction. Kellner took the typical cubist \\"multi-view\\" (in German \\"Mehransichtigkeit\\") approach of the objects and developed it into the central design element of his photographs. The perspective of the individual images ‚Äì shifted in relation to the Central perspective ‚Äì gives the impression of movement of the immobile architectural icons: \\"The viewer thinks that by dismanteling a building into individual pieces of an image and by tilting the camera several times the most famous sites in the world ‚Äì from the Eiffel Tower to the Brooklyn Bridge ‚Äì begin to rock, to sway, even to dance. Architecture is turned upside down.\\" When Kellner traveled to Mexico in 2006 to photograph important buildings there, one critic noted that his photos looked very similar to those taken after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. \\"Kellner‚Äôs photographs are often read as deconstructing the landmarks of human culture. From this perspective, his pictures are a visual manifestation of the way in which culture has become vulnerable, broken, and collapsing.\\" Dance and destruction thus lie close together in the works of Kellner. The perception of large objects is usually not perceivable to humans at a single glance. Only as the eye wanders and adds up a \\"total view\\" of many different impressions does the depicted object become clear: \\"Our brain completes incoming sensory information into a uniform whole and ascribes meaning to this perception\\" (In German \\"Unser Gehirn erg√§nzt einlaufende Sinnesinformationen zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen und schreibt dieser Wahrnehmung Bedeutung zu\\"). Kellner not only shows exactly this combination of individual images to form a Gestalt perception in his works, but the viewer himself actively recreates this experience when watching a Kellner photograph. His eyes, too, constantly move back and forth between the perception of the individual images to the overall shot and the photographs of Kellner thus can be perceived as a kind of experimental arrangement for a direct experience of what happens when we see large objects: \\"It is no coincidence that Kellner‚Äôs works should look like assembled puzzles because they engage the thoughtful viewer into unraveling ‚Äîboth visually and intellectually‚Äîthe meaning of these architectural structures. We decode the scenes from the fragments he puts together, from the automatic expectations submitted by our brain, and from the more or less vague memories we have of the structures.\\".

In Shang Dynasty and the Western ZhouÔºåit was a carnival where lovers could date. Gradually, it became a sacrifice ritual to appease/in honour of Tudishen (God of the Soil and the Ground). People usually celebrate this festival on the fifth Wu Day (according to Sexagenary cycle) after Lichun, which is near Chunfen. According to folklore, the date could be February 2, February 8, February 12, February 15 based on the lunar calendar. The record of Chunshe can be traced as far back as on oracle bones. With a history of more than 2000 years, It is one of China's oldest festivals. Chunshe remained a significant traditional festival in China before the Yuan Dynasty. Nowadays, though part of China (including mainland and Taiwan) still keeps the custom of worshiping Tudigong on February 2 (lunar calendar), the new celebration, now called Tudidan (the birthday of Tudigong), is not exactly the same as the traditional one. The Longtaitou Festival (meaning dragon raising its head), which is celebrated by the northern region of China, also retains some customs of Chunshe. A scholar once summarized the whole trajectory of Chunshe as \\"originating in the period of the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, springing up in the Qin and Han dynasties, continuing in Wei, Jin, and the Northern and Southern dynasties, flourishing in Tang and Song dynasties and declining in Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties.\\". Like many other traditional festivals relevant to sacrifice, Chunshe can be divided into two types according to different hosts, namely the official Chunshe and the folk Chunshe. Official celebrations were grand and solemn with complex ceremonials, while the folk ones were full of life. People would hold parties in their communities and attend various leisure activities at that day. The customs included beating drums, feasting, drinking and watching drama in the community. Such merry occasions were rare. The Chinese word ‚ÄúShehui\\" (society) actually has its root in community activities in Chunshe. Every year, the festival of Sheri (Community Day) is held two times, one in spring and one in autumn. It was because ancient Chinese believed that \\"the prayer in spring can be rewarded in autumn\\":540. Shang Binghe, a famous scholar of I Ching at the turn of the Republic of China, described Sheri as \\"the oldest and the most prevailing festival in Chinese history\\". One of its legacies is the temples housing the Tudishen which are still common across China.  History  = Originates in the period of the Xia, Shang and Zhou Dynasties = In ancient China, \\"She\\", according to Shuowen Jiezi, refers to the deity of the land . In ancient times, the main way of food acquisition in China changed from fishing, hunting and animal husbandry to agriculture. Therefore, people came to realize the importance of the land and began to worship it. The land was personalized and then the idea of \\"deity of the land\\" came into existence. The rulers, as well as the people at that period, began to offer sacrifices to the deity Ôºâ. The descriptions of the ceremony could be found in oracle bone scripts.ÂºïËá™„ÄäÁî≤È™®ÊñáÂÖ®ÈõÜ¬∑13505„ÄãÔºåËΩΩÔºö‚ÄúÂ∑±‰∫•ÂçúÔºåË¥ûÁéã‰æëÁü≥Âú®È∫ìÂåó‰∏úÔºå‰πçÈÇë‰πã„ÄÇ‚Äù Áéã‰æëÁü≥‚ÄùÊåáÂïÜÁéãÁ≠ëÈÇëÊó∂ÁöÑÁ•≠Á§æ‰πã‰∏æ„ÄÇ Gradually, these customs of sacrifice developed into what people later called Chunshe. It is fair to say that Chunshe can be dated back to the time when the \\"deity of the land\\" was created, namely the late patriarchal clan society„ÄÇ. In general, the purposes of Chunshe include: Ôºö * pray for a good harvest * pray for good weather * pray for good luck * entertain the deity and the people * pray for a good marriage and for having children * pray for victory A considerable amount of scholars reckon that In addition to the deity of the land, people also offer sacrifice to the deity of five grains. In the early Qin Dynasty, celebrations of Chunshe could last for a relatively long time as all sacrifices made to the land in spring can be called Chunshe. At that time, the celebrations included two major types. One type was the sacrifices to the land and ancestors :42 while the other one called Chunxi (spring carnival) was more entertaining in which people can have orgies. Before the Warring States period, \\"Shela\\" was the only festival :414. Once, after the recovery of a disease, King Zhaoxiang of Qin ordered to kill the cow and offer it as a sacrifice. However, he was dissuaded by Gongsun Yan as the time for Shela was yet to come.ÂºïËá™„ÄäÈü©ÈùûÂ≠ê¬∑Â§ñÂÇ®ËØ¥¬∑Âè≥‰∏ãÁ¨¨‰∏âÂçÅ‰∫î¬∑ËØ¥‰∫å„ÄãÔºåÂéüÊñá‰∏∫Ôºö‚ÄúÁß¶Ë•ÑÁéãÁóÖÔºåÁôæÂßì‰∏∫‰πãÁ•∑ÔºõÁóÖÊÑàÔºåÊùÄÁâõÂ°ûÁ•∑„ÄÇÈÉé‰∏≠ÈòéÈÅè„ÄÅÂÖ¨Â≠ôË°çÂá∫ËßÅ‰πãÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö‚ÄòÈùûÁ§æËÖä‰πãÊó∂‰πüÔºåÂ•öËá™ÊùÄÁâõËÄåÁ•†Á§æÔºü‚ÄôÊÄ™ËÄåÈóÆ‰πã„ÄÇ‚Äù  Types of Chunshe  Chunshe can be divided into different types according to its hosts.

Since the early period of Qin, the official Chunshe did not see many changes in terms of ritual, process and function. However, in different dynasties where there are different political systems and various names for the administrative unit, the name of Chunshe also changed accordingly. During the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period, great changes took place in the social and political structure. The types of Chunshe was no longer determined by the rank of the host but by regions. Zhi'she gradually evolved into ‚ÄúLi'she‚Äù (the folk Chunshe). Li'she was usually presided over by the local government official and the cost was shared by the people themselves. This form of activity greatly boosted public enthusiasm to participate in social affairs, strengthened the social function of the folk Chunshe, and finally settle it as a festival. The official sacrifice has to follow a full set of etiquette including burying the sacrificial offering, dropping blood on the ground and using a human sacrifice „ÄÇ During the spring and autumn period, there were mainly two ways of offering sacrifices in Li'she. One was to offer to gods the quarry hunted together by 25 families. The second was to offer sacrifices together. After the sacrifice, all participants gathered together, eating and drinking to their heart‚Äôs content . This was a festival that the whole community would participate in.„ÄäÁ§ºËÆ∞¬∑ÈÉäÁâπÁâ≤„ÄãËΩΩ‚ÄúÂîØ‰∏∫Á§æ‰∫ãÔºåÂçïÔºàÈÄö‚ÄúÊÆö‚ÄùÔºåÂ∞ΩÔºâ‰∫ÜÈáå„ÄÇÂîØ‰∏∫Á§æÂõΩÔºåÂõΩ‰∫∫ÊØï‰Ωú„ÄÇ‚ÄùÂ≠ôÂ∏åÊó¶Ê≥®‚ÄúÂîØ‰∏∫Á•≠Á§æÔºå‰∏ÄÈáå‰πã‰∫∫ÂçïÂá∫ÔºåÊØèÂÆ∂‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰∏∫Á§æÁî∞Á´≠Âäõ„ÄÇ‚Äù It was a time for party and feast Ôºå.ÂºïËá™„ÄäËØóÁªè¬∑Â∞èÈõÖ¬∑Áî´Áî∞„ÄãÔºåÂéüÊñáËßÅËµ∑Ê∫êÈÉ®ÂàÜÂè≥‰æßÊ°ÜÂÜÖÊñáÂ≠ó„ÄÇ There is a lively description of the scene of Chunshe in Lao Tzu ‚Äúthe street is dense with the merry crowd‚Äù.ÂºïËá™„ÄäÈÅìÂæ∑Áªè¬∑Á¨¨‰∫åÂçÅÁ´†„Äã Shang Binghe called it ‚Äúan orgy in the name of sacrifice‚Äù .

Early life Born into a clerical family, he was the son of the Rev. Edward Stillingfleet (died 1777), vicar of Wolverley and later of Hartlebury, and his wife Elizabeth Jackson. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford in 1759. His older first cousin James Stillingfleet (1729‚Äì1817), also a grandson of Dean James Stillingfleet (1674‚Äì1729), was at that time in Oxford as an academic. The elder James Stillingfleet, a Fellow of Merton College until 1767, was prominent in Oxford as a leading evangelical: he led Methodist prayer meetings, associated with Richard Hill and was a contact of John Newton who mentioned him to Alexander Clunie in 1766. James Stillingfleet the younger, of Queen's, graduated B.A. in 1762, and M.A. in 1765. He found his way to an evangelical position on justification by grace, initially by reading William Law. He was ordained deacon in 1764, and priest in 1766, by James Johnson, Bishop of Worcester. In Yorkshire Stillingfleet took up in 1766 the position of chaplain to Richard Richardson of Bierley Hall. Bierley Chapel was constructed at this time. His patron, Richard Richardson the younger (1708‚Äì1781), son of the physician Richard Richardson (1663‚Äì1741), had building work carried out on Bierley Hall, and a chapel added on his North Bierley estate. Preaching at a place in Bowling lying now within the City of Bradford, Stillingfleet attracted an audience from Bradford itself. With the foundation of the Elland Clerical Society in 1767, a Yorkshire evangelical network began to take shape. In 1771 Stillingfleet became a parish priest, at Hotham, south of the market town Market Weighton in the East Riding. At a later point, he set up the Hotham Society, to emulate the Elland Society in the West Riding founded by Henry Venn at Huddersfield, which from 1777 was in a position to fund an Oxbridge education for potential ordinands. Stillingfleet became a close friend of Joseph Milner, who taught at Hull Grammar School from 1767, and was curate at North Ferriby from 1768. A third in the group of close friends was William Richardson of York (1745‚Äì1821): he was a pupil at St Bees School of John James (1729‚Äì1785), ordained in 1768 by Robert Hay Drummond to a curacy at Kirbymoorside. Milner's The History of the Church of Christ became a standard work, and was a product of the early years of the 1770s when he had become a convinced evangelical, and lost friends in Hull. Much of it was written at Stillingfleet's rectory. The evangelical clerical societies of the later 18th centuries worked to provide graduate priests.Charles Smyth, The Evangelical Movement in Perspective, The Cambridge Historical Journal Vol. 7, No. 3 (1943), pp. 160‚Äì174, at p. 169. Published by: Cambridge University Press Robert Wasney (1772/3‚Äì1836) was a product of this Yorkshire milieu. He was a pupil of Milner at Hull Grammar School, and went on to Clare College, Cambridge in 1791, associating with followers of Charles Simeon, and graduating B.A. in 1795. He was ordained priest in 1796, to Waghen, but soon went as curate to Stillingfleet at Hotham. He was much impressed by the trio, with Robinson. He moved to St Thomas's Chapel, Newcastle upon Tyne. Stillingfleet in 1775 built a house, Hotham Villa, near the existing rectory which was a cottage; from 1870 to the 1950s it was used as the rectory. In 1797, he won a Gold Medal of the Society of Arts for the cultivation of rhubarb. He died on 19 December 1826 at age 85, and was buried in the parish church on 27 December. Works Thomas Adam, parish priest at Wintringham for half a century, ran a \\"Parson's Club\\" and associated with Stillingfleet and his friends. His Posthumous Works (1786) were edited by the Hotham Society group of Stillingfleet, Joseph Milner and William Richardson of York, with Stillingfleet providing the biographical introduction signed \\"J.S\\".Isabel Rivers, William Law and Religious Revival: The Reception of A Serious Call, Huntington Library Quarterly Vol. 71, No. 4 (December 2008), pp. 633‚Äì649, at p. 639 note 30. Published by: University of Pennsylvania Press A slim volume of diary entries from these Works, entitled Private Thoughts on Religion, became a religious classic. It was in demand from Anglican evangelicals, and was reprinted through the 19th century in the UK and USA.Ed Potten, The Rest of the Iceberg: Reassessing Private Book Ownership in the Nineteenth Century, Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society, Vol. 15, No. 3, Great collectors and their grand designs: a centenary celebration of the life and work of A.

Published by: Cambridge Bibliographical Society Through the work, Thomas Adam was known in the family of Jacques Reclus.Lucien Carrive, Lettres √©crites par les filles du pasteur Jacques Reclus √† Zo√© Tuy√®s (Steeg) 1856-1863, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de l'Histoire du Protestantisme Fran√ßais (1903-2015), Vol. 143 (Octobre-Novembre- D√©cembre 1997), pp. 663‚Äì730, at p. 680. Published by: Librairie Droz In 1848 Edward Bickersteth combined \\"Thoughts on Religion\\" from the Pens√©es with Private Thoughts, which was organised in a similar way. John Henry Overton, writing in 1881, called Private Thoughts a \\"once popular devotional book\\", but also \\"of no small merit\\", characterising Stillingfleet as Adam's \\"pious and accomplished biographer\\" who revived interest in William Law. Stillingfleet himself published: *A Sermon Preached at the Opening of the General Infirmary at Hull, on Wednesday the First of September, 1784. *A Short and Familiar Explanation of the Church-Catechism (1787) He edited: *Sermons on important subjects : selected from the papers of the Rev. John King, B. A. Late Vicar of Middleton, near Pickering, and Minister of St. Mary's, Hull (1782), with a funeral sermon. Family In 1774 Stillingfleet married Elizabeth Taylor, daughter of William Taylor (died 1752) of Great Hadham, and the sister of William Taylor How of Stondon Place in Essex. William Taylor How was a friend of Thomas Gray, a graduate and Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and died in 1777. Stondon Place, and the requirement to change his surname, came from a distant relation, John How (died 1748). Elizabeth was co-heiress, but the house went to her sisters Jane (died 1793) and Ann. Edward William Stillingfleet, who was curate of Hotham from 1814 to 1844, was James's son.

Based at the Staatsoper Stuttgart from 1955 to 1992, she performed roles such as Verdi's Azucena and Eboli at leading opera houses in Europe and the Americas. Her signature role was Wagner's Brang√§ne, performed at the Bayreuth Festival, among others.  Life  Goldie Hoffman was born on January 14, 1921, in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of Hungarian origin. She studied literature and musicology and received her first vocal training from Lila Robeso, then with Friedrich Schorr and Giuseppe Gentile as well as Mario Basiola in Rome. In 1951 she won a singing competition in Lausanne. She made her debut in 1951 with the touring Wagner Opera Company as Lucia in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. The same year, she appeared as the Priestess in Verdi's Aida at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. In 1952, she performed at the Opernhaus Z√ºrich as Azucena in Verdi's Il trovatore and remained there until 1955. She then moved to the Staatsoper Stuttgart, where she was a member of the ensemble until 1992. She appeared as a guest at La Scala in Milan in 1955, in the role of Fricka in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre, opposite Martha M√∂dl, Wolfgang Windgassen, and Hans Hotter. She returned to that theatre in 1974, for Herodias in Salome, with Dame Gwyneth Jones. The dramatic mezzo-soprano performed regularly at the Royal Opera House in London and the Vienna State Opera, where she sang from 1961 to 1990. Hoffman performed at the Bavarian State Opera, the San Francisco Opera, the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, the Paris Op√©ra, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, the Op√©ra national de Bordeaux, the Teatro Comunale Bologna, La Fenice in Venice, Teatro San Carlo in Naples, La Monnaie in Brussels, the Copenhagen Opera House, the Philadelphia Opera, and the Liceu in Barcelona.

She returned to the Met in 1971, again in Tristan und Isolde, now opposite Jess Thomas, Birgit Nilsson, and John Macurdy, conducted by Erich Leinsdorf. In 1964, she sang Elisabetta in a concert version of Donizetti's Maria Stuarda at Carnegie Hall. From 1957 to 1970, Hoffman performed at the Bayreuth Festival in her signature role as Brang√§ne in Tristan und Isolde (1957‚Äì59, 1966, 1968‚Äì70), as well as in Der Ring des Nibelungen as Siegrune (1958, 1960‚Äì64), Waltraute (1960‚Äì61, 1964, 1968‚Äì69), the Second Norn (1961‚Äì64) and Fricka (1962‚Äì64), in 1967-68 also as Ortrud in Lohengrin. A few months after the death of Wieland Wagner, Bayreuth toured his production to the Osaka International Festival, in 1967, of Die Walk√ºre, when Hoffman portrayed Fricka with Anja Silja, Theo Adam, Helge Dernesch, and Thomas, conducted by Thomas Schippers. It was televised, though it has never been published commercially.

In 1963, she joined the theatre company of Duro Ladipo, whom she married the following year. Acting in her husband's epic plays, she was particularly successful in the role of Oya in Oba Koso and in the title role of Moremi. In the 1960s and early 1970s, she appeared across Europe in several international festivals. Since her husband's death in 1978, Abiodun has appeared in Nigerian television series and in films promoting African culture, once again playing Moremi in the 2009 film of the same name. Biography Abiodun was born into a royal family at Ijan-Ekiti in Nigeria's Ekiti State.

Biography Paolo Woods grew up in Italy in a Dutch-Canadian family. From 1991 to 2000 he ran a black and white professional photo lab and a photography gallery in Florence named Print. In 1999 he turned to documentary photography and went to Iran to document the reforms President Khatami was trying to implement. There he met the writer and journalist . From 2000 to 2002, together with Michel, Woods travelled through twelve countries ‚Äì among them the United States, Iraq, Angola, Kazakhstan and Russia ‚Äì following the route of oil production and trade, conducting a behind-the-scenes investigation of the industry. In 2002 and 2004 they worked in Afghanistan and Iraq, producing a detailed reportage on the westerners' debacle there that eventually became the book American Chaos. In the same years, Woods, Michel and founded Riverboom, a collective and publisher, later joined by Gabriele Galimberti and Edoardo Delille. In 2005 Woods won his first World Press Photo award in General News. In 2007 and 2008 Woods worked across Africa documenting the birth of \\"Chinafrica\\",Chinafrica, anglicizing of the French term Chinafrique, itself a blend of Chine and Afrique. the spectacular rise of the Chinese who were then massively investing in Africa and had changed the geopolitical order (see Africa‚ÄìChina economic relations). The resulting book, coauthored with Serge Michel and Michel Beuret, has been translated to eleven languages and has been acclaimed as the most thorough investigation of the phenomenon, and as an example of art and documentary photography united. It sold more than 40,000 copies in France alone. In 2010 Woods completed the work Marche sur mes yeux, an intimate portrait of Iran, hoping to overcome the stereotyped vision of the country and show the complexity of its identities. The photographs were widely published and exhibited in galleries and festivals such as the Rencontres d'Arles in France and in Switzerland. In 2010 Woods moved to Haiti. For four years he worked there on the project State, which recounts the islanders' experience and describes the dynamics at work in all the developing countries: international organisations versus local government, civil society versus executive power, private versus public money. The project grew three-dimensional in Haiti including a book, coauthored with a prize- winning\\"Arnaud Robert remporte le prix Jean Dumur\\", RTS, 29 November 2012. Accessed 30 July 2020. Swiss journalist , that was translated into Haitian Creole, an exhibition outside Facult√© d'Ethnologie (Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti) of Port-au-Prince and the outdoor installations across the city realised with the support of local artists. The first exhibition of the project in Europe was hosted at the Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e in Lausanne. In 2012 he received his second World Press Photo award in the Daily Life section for his reportage on the importance of the radio network in Haiti. In an interview with the New York Times, Woods said about his work: > Photojournalists tend to divide the world into good and bad. You constantly > find those two elements that we so clearly think define our vision of the > world. But things are a lot more mixed. There are not just bad guys and good > guys. That is what is interesting to me, to get into the nuances and make > images that are not answers, but raise more questions. In 2013 Woods and Robert published another book set in Haiti, P√®p√®. In 2014, in collaboration with an Italian photographer, Gabriele Galimberti, Woods completed The Heavens, an investigation into tax havens.

It relates to political pressure and cabinet government. History What we know as the Shawcross principle was the subject of parliamentary debate on 29 January 1951. In a lengthy defense of his conduct regarding an illegal strike, Attorney-General Shawcross cited hundreds of years of precedent as to the firm foundation of his actions. The principle (or doctrine) states that the Attorney General: * must take into account matters of public interest, * that assistance from cabinet colleagues must be limited to advice, * that responsibility for the decision is that of the Attorney General alone, and * that the government is not to put pressure on him or her. The 1964 Rivard affair in Canada caused the sitting Attorney-General, Guy Favreau, to resign because of his non-prosecution of senior officials in the Pearson government over their attempted bribery of American officials in Rivard's case. The Shawcross principle was cited by Australian Attorney-General Bob Ellicott who cited attempts by his boss, Malcolm Fraser, to control his discretion. In 2004 in the context of the Tony Blair's invasion of Iraq, a whistleblower by the name of Katharine Gun risked prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Lawyers for Gun, who was formerly a GCHQ translator, asked for disclosure of advice on the legality of the Iraq war given by Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith in his role as the government's legal adviser. Goldsmith said that he had conducted what is known as a \\"Shawcross exercise\\". Goldsmith sent a \\"Shawcross letter\\" to the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, who was responsible for GCHQ, advising him that HMG should decline to pursue Gun.

The building dates from the 15th century, and has a 12th-century font. It was listed on 1 March 1963 as a fine example of a substantial mediaeval double-nave church with important memorials. Parish history The ancient parish of Rudbaxton was in the hundred of Dungleddy, a corruption of the Welsh for two Cleddau, referring to the Eastern and Western Cleddau rivers, which form part of the parish boundary. It appeared as Redbaxton on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. The Haverfordwest to Fishguard turnpike (now the A40) ran through the western half of the parish. Once entirely rural and agricultural, the parish now includes the northeastern part of the expanding county town of Haverfordwest. There were two chapels of ease in the parish, dedicated to St Margaret and St Catherine, but both were in ruins before the 1830s. The former parish of Rudbaxton is now in the combined parish of Daugleddau in the Diocese of St Davids. Opposite the church is Rudbaxton Rath, the remains of a prehistoric fortification whose origins are obscure. Church The earliest record of a church on the site was made by Wizo, one-time lord of Wiston, in a grant to the Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem in the 12th century, referring to it as Ecclesia Rudepagstona. Before it was dedicated to St Michael, a church on the site was dedicated to St Madoc. A royal commission in 1920 listed the church as having 13th century origins with a later added aisle and a two storey tower with 24 stairs, and noted that a spring outside the churchyard was named St Madoc's Well. =Structure= The parish church of St Michael was originally established prior to the fifteenth century (there is a 12th century font), but the present building, built of rubble stone with slate roofing, retains some late-15th or early-16th century features. The building was restored \\"from a state of ruin\\" by the rector in the 19th century. The tower has a vaulted base. The nave is probably earlier than the chancel, the arch of which, along with the roofs, was replaced in 1845 by Ewan Christian. In 1892, the church was further restored by R. G. Pinder of Bournemouth, who replaced all the roofs and many of the fittings, bringing the building to its present state whilst retaining many parts of the earlier structures. The internal walls are plastered and painted. The tower was lime-rendered in 2000. =Fittings= The oak pulpit is 20th century. The font, rectangular and scalloped with a round base, is 12th century. The 1892 renovation added simple pine pews to the nave and chancel; the pews in the aisle are earlier, grained wood. Several windows have stained or coloured glass fitted in the 19th or 20th centuries. =Memorials= Howard Howard Memorial There is a significant monument to the local Howard family, probably commissioned by Joanna, wife of the Reverend James Howard in 1685 and depicting several family members and described as one of the finest memorials in the county. Pevsner describes it as \\"splendidly large\\" and notes that the carved figures have no parallels in Pembrokeshire, suggesting that they may have been imported from Bristol. The authors criticise the modern repainting, undertaken \\"without research as to the original scheme\\". Picton Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton, the most senior officer to die at the Battle of Waterloo, has a memorial slab in the chancel floor and a Romanesque bust in the wall. Picton was born in Haverfordwest in 1758, and grew up at Poyston Hall in the parish. Other Pictons are memorialised in the church, including Thomas's brother John, also a general in the army, who is buried in the church, and another General Picton, William, who died in 1811 and was buried in the family vault in St George's, Hanover Square. John Picton's memorial is framed by a lion, a shield and banners, although Pevsner notes that the sculptor, Daniel Mainwaring of Carmarthen, had \\"clearly never seen a lion\\". Others There are numerous other 18th, 19th and 20th century monuments and memorials dating from 1665 to 1909 to local people from servant to architect to archbishop, this last being a brass plate to William Laud, who was rector from 1622 to 1626, during his time as Bishop of St Davids. There is a plaque remembering six parishioners who lost their lives during World War I.

In the form visible today, it is the result of several construction phases, under the property of different noble families, and subsequent partial destructions. History The castle's origin is connected to a tower house belonging to the Visconti family and dating back at least to the 13th century. It was taken by the Della Torre around 1270, during the period of the conflict between the factions supporting the two families. To consolidate their position in the Legnano area, the Della Torre enlarged the tower house. After the defeat of the Della Torre, the fortification passed again to the Visconti. In the 15th century, the Duke of Milan Filippo Maria Visconti granted the castle to Oldrado II Lampugnani. He intervened on the castle, adding to the old building a larger external enclosure with an entrance tower and six semi-cylindrical turrets. The construction material was the bricks, commonly used in the Visconti castles of the flat regions under their rule. However, the semi-cylindrical turrets make it different from that type. A large moat surrounded the castle. A drawbridge over the ditch conducted to the gate of the entrance tower. During the following centuries, the castles decayed, the vegetation attacked and partially compromised the building. Two of the semi-cylindrical towers (those on the southern side) went lost. In the 20th century, the Municipality of Legnano, owner of the castle, secured and restored it. Aerial view Today After its restoration, the Municipality of Legnano opened the castle to the public. Around it, the Parco del Castello, a public park, was created on the island and the area near the Olona river. The moat is devoid of water. Since 2008, the castle and its park have been included in the wider Parco dei Mulini extended to other municipalities along the Olona river.

He painted as team with his father, John Henry Hintermeister, and together they created more than 1000 works. Henry may have begun began his professional career as early as 1914 (age 17), when a copyright for a Henry Hintermeister was registered. He is best known today for his \\"American themed paintings.\\" Henry‚Äôs earliest published works featured family, images of women and children, dogs, horses and recreation. He also painted fantastic scenes, with Indian maidens and scantily clad Romans and Egyptians. In later years he created ionic and semi-comical works, with subjects including the multiple dangers of crossing the street, children and grandparents, fishermen, policemen, boy scouts and hunters. One of his iconic works was the \\"Uncle Natchel\\" series of paintings for Chilean Natural Soda, which debuted in 1935 as a calendar print and ran into the early 1960s. While Henry surpassed his father in 21st century databases, by being the main person associated with the signature \\"Hy Hintermeister,\\", he got his start teaming with his father. Collectors have found it difficult on some works to tell the creator from the signature alone. When Henry began having works published in his name in 1919, his father had been working for about 30 years. When his father died in 1945, Henry continued to paint for about 25 years more. Between them, their shared \\"Hy Hintermeister\\" had mature painters signing it for decades. Name Henry appeared on documents for most of his life without a middle initial. However, his birth certificate named him Henry August Adam Hintermeister, and on the 1910 census he was Henry A. A. Hintermeister. He was Henry A.

It was constructed from 1637 to 1642.  Construction  = Previous structures = In the 14th and 15th centuries the southern part of the current location of the citadel was part of the city proper. It contained the Orthen Gate, which had been constructed between 1315 and 1350. Later Bastion Orthenpoort was constructed to protect this part of the city. In 1541 a first attempt to construct it had been made with the assistance of the Italian architect and engineer Alessandro Pasqualini. In 1617-1618 the Bastion was finally constructed when the threat of the Dutch Republic became ever more real. = Construction of the citadel = The citadel's gunpowder magazine dates from 1750 In 1629 the Dutch Republic conquered 's-Hertogenbosch after a famous siege. It spelled the end for Bastion Orthenpoort, and the Orthen Gate was demolished in 1635. In 1637 construction of the citadel started. The design was probably by Pieter Bilderbeeck, inspector of national fortifications. He chose a regular pentagonal form with bastions with brick walls. This was a kind of ideal type of fortification, cf the Citadel of Lille. It got the name Fortress Willem Maria, after two children of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, conqueror of the city. The fortress had two functions: It strengthened the city defenses, and it kept the city under control. Because of the latter it received the nickname papenbril. The Dutch word 'papen' referred to the suspected popery of the Catholic inhabitants. The citadel kept the inhabitants in line because it interrupted the city walls. I.e. the inhabitants could revolt, but then they would not be able to defend the city. The fort was probably completed in 1642, when the future Stadholder Willem II visited. = Construction of the Esplanade = 'Guardhouse' or arsenal of the citadel In order to be able to defend the city-side of the citadel, in case that the city fell, an open area was required. Without it, an attacker which had conquered the city, could simply move its siege guns into buildings near the citadel, and destroy its walls at close range. Therefore 40 houses of the Ortheneind quarter were demolished together with the St Peter and Paul Church., totaling about 4 hectares of the city. The open space that was created would become known as De Plein (the esplanade). Ideas that the Republic simply demolished part of the town so it could fire on potential rebels are popular, but are not supported by facts. In fact, the demolition of the buildings on the Esplanade would only be completed in 1646, because the new masters of the city negotiated with the owners of the buildings which they wanted to remove. = Rivers Dommel, Aa and Dieze = The confluence of the rivers Dommel and Aa formed the western boundary of the terrain where the citadel was built. From their confluence they flowed north to the Meuse as the river Dieze. At the time the Aa river flowed along the north western city walls, like it does now. On the advice of Hendrik Nobel the Aa was widened in 1639. In order to prevent the city from overflowing in case of inundations, there were two dams in the moat of the citadel. The first was near the confluence with the Dieze. The other was where the north west city wall had been. Close by a new Orthen Gate was constructed.  Citadel of 's Hertogenbosch  Situation in late 1780s (Probable date) Up till the end of the eighteenth century there was no permanent habitation of the citadel. In 1789 a military prison was built in the citadel. This building also housed the military court. There is a map which shows the gunpowder magazine from about 1750, as well as an outline of the military prison. It can therefore be dated between 1750 and 1789, and probably to the late 1780s. At the time the citadel had a house for the commander, the gunpowder magazine, a magazine for cannonballs, a magazine for stakes to use for the palisades, and a laboratory to make grenades and other gunpowder products. There was also a cellar for ice in the later demolished bastion I. Of particular interest is that the map also shows the building near the north west gate, and calls it the 'Arsenal', just like Hattinga did in 1749. In 1785 the inspecting Lt- General van der Drissen mentioned a 'Verbuswinkel', probably a corruption of 'Bushuis', which also means arsenal. = The citadel during the 1794 siege = Main building of 1789 During the first of the coalition wars against the French Republic, the territory of present day Belgium was lost in the Flanders campaign of 1794. The French armies then moved north against the Dutch Republic. On 22 September 1794 the French army took the unoccupied Fort Orthen, about 1 kilometre from the citadel. On the 23rd the French howitzers started to bombard the citadel and town from Orthen. The besieging French artillery did quite some damage in the town, but generally the town's artillery had the upper hand. On 27 September 1794 Fort Cr√®vecoeur on the Meuse was taken by the French. It allowed them to somewhat lower the inundations around the town, and gave them many guns to press the siege. The French attack towards the citadel and the adjoining harbor would get closest of all the approaches. Later it was claimed that a breach had already started in the wall of the citadel when the town surrendered. On 9 October the governor agreed to hand over the city by treaty. Perhaps the town could have held out longer. However, it's probable that the early surrender enabled most French emigr√©e soldiers to march out in uniform together with the garrison on 12 October. Those who tried to escape in civilian clothes, where mostly captured, some of them betrayed by citizens. They were imprisoned in the citadel and mostly hanged on the grounds. = The citadel during the 1813-1814 liberation = In November 1813 Prince William landed in the Hague. Within a month he ruled the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands. However, many fortresses remained under French control. 's Hertogenbosch was one of these. Commander Colonel Moul√© de la Raitrie had been in 's-Hertogenbosch for four years, and was quite aware of how it could be defended. On 12 december 1813 the garrison was reinforced by the retreating troops of general Molitor. On 15 December the Prussian commander Adolf Friedrich von Oppen crossed the Meuse. On the 18th Molitor left 's Hertogenbosch for Grave, but 500 soldiers were left behind to garrison the citadel, even though there were few supplies. On 19 December Oppen bombarded the citadel, and demanded its surrender. In light of their superior artillery, the defenders flatly rejected this demand. However, even from a short term perspective, there was little hope for the garrison. It had eighty guns, and a lot of war material, but only a 1,000 men. Such a garrison was way too small for 's-Hertogenbosch. Even so, it could have held out against Oppen's forces if it had been supported by the populace, but this was not the case. On the contrary, in the night of 6-7 January 1814 a resistance committee published its desire to get rid of the French on the streets of the town. The French were not able to find out who headed the resistance. Next, an alliance negotiator appeared on 15 January 1814, but he was sent back. The resistance then coordinated an uprising in the town with an assault from the outside. During the night of 25-26 January 1814 multiple city gates were assaulted from within the town and from the outside. The French were defeated, and retreated to the citadel. Now the victors could make very credible threats to the French, who were very far from their own army. On the morrow of taking the town, 26 January, the French capitulated on adverse terms. The officers were free to leave on promise of not serving for a year, but the soldiers became prisoners of war. = Construction of the first barracks = After the Belgian Revolution of 1830-1831, the military prison in the Citadel was abandoned, and became a ruin. The Revolutions of 1848 prompted the government to repair the fortifications of 's-Hertogenbosch. In June 1853 the minister of defense decided to tender the renovation of the prison as a barracks. The estimate was 18,000 guilders. In July the job was finally awarded for 13,700 guilders. The plan had been made by Mr. van Maaren. It included better lodgings for men and officers. Other measures were directed at creating the possibility to make the building 'bomb free', probably by packing earth against it. The attics of the building were lowered. In 1854 the last phase of the reconstruction of the fortress started when work on the citadel's walls commenced. It seems that in 1855 the soldiers of the Tolbrug barracks were the first to use the new barracks. In 1858 the punishment battalion from Medemblik of 240 soldiers was quartered in the citadel. It was a good place for this battalion on account of the citadel's isolation, and there were many stories of soldiers attempting to escape. The municipality however was worried about the combination of this battalion with the 50,000 kg of gunpowder in the citadel.  Non-fortified military use  The 1899 guard house at the southern gate = 1870: The citadel becomes obsolete = During the whole nineteenth century the significance of the fortress and citadel had steadily diminished. In 1870 the citadel was 'mobilized' for the last time, but now it was only a small part of a fortified position that started at the 'Lunetten van Vught'. Furthermore, it was only prepared against a raid, not against a serious siege. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 changed the Dutch defensive strategy. It led to the 1874 Fortification law, which recognized that fortifications like the citadel were obsolete. It determined that the fortress 's-Hertogenbosch would be dismantled. The government remained owner of the citadel, but it no longer had a function in the city's defenses. The esplanade was returned to the municipality. The military would remain in the citadel till the 1960s. = NCO school (1869-1890) = In March 1869 the minister of defense wanted to improve the scientific education for non-commissioned officers in the infantry. Therefore all NCO's that entered into education to become a lieutenant second class were divided in two classes. The second class was given with each regiment, and led to the second class. The first class, which led to the exam for lieutenant 2nd class, would be given only in the major garrisons of 's-Hertogenbosch and Maastricht. In 's-Hertogenbosch this was the 5th regiment, which would have four lieutenants to give the course, known as 'Hoofdcursus' in Dutch. In April 1869 it became known that the citadel would be the home of the course, and three companies of the 1st battalion of the 5th regiment were moved out. The warehouse of clothing for the 5th regiment remained in the citadel. During the 1870 mobilization of the fortress, the NCO's participating in the course were sent back to their regiments. Later the course was resumed. In 1877 there was a suspicion of fraud at the course in Maastricht, and so that school was disbanded, and the students divided over the remaining infantry institutes in 's-Hertogenbosch and Kampen. In 1880 the course for cavalry course NCO's was also split in two classes, and the first was merged into the infantry 'hoofdcursus'. The 'hoofdcursus' was given with the intention that all students were good enough to succeed, and would become officers. Therefore the number of students was related and limited to the number of officers vacancies. In 1883 the school had 59 students for the infantry, and 6 for the artillery, and was dividend in two study years. On 1 October 1890 the school was merged with that in Kampen, and its building became available for a new purpose. = A bastion is lost to shipping (1880) = The Zuid-Willemsvaart was an important canal dug which had been dug between 1823 and 1825. It had been dug through the quite north-west side of the town's center, south of the citadel. In the succeeding years ships on the canal became bigger, and steam propulsion was introduced. Now it became increasingly troublesome to navigate in the small space between Bastion I, which stuck out into the canal, and the water gates of the town's harbor. This was not only a matter space, but also had to do with currents. In 1880, Bastion I was therefore almost completely demolished to facilitate shipping. = Second barracks (1890) = In 1890 the minister of defense asked to increase the 1891 budget by 42,000 guilders. He planned to change the main building and renovate the citadel, so a complete infantry battalion could be housed. The new barracks were finished somewhere in 1891-1892. The changes included four new wings that were attached to the building, resembling a letter 'H'. In 1899 the current guard house was built next to the southern gate.  Current situation  In the 1980s a major restoration of the citadel began. In 1984 the four wings, which had been added to the 1789 building in 1891, were demolished again. Big concrete basements were dug out for a new use of the building as archives. During the excavations the medieval city wall and Orthen Gate were located. The big building is now the home of the Brabants Historisch Informatie Centrum, a merger of the national archives for Noord Brabant and several community and other archives. The citadel is still owned by the state.

Her work provided the first demonstration that a fertile polyploid hybrid had formed between two cultivated plant species. Education and personal life She was born 31 July 1877 in Chelsea, London, UK. She was the second of the four children of Sir Kenelm Edward Digby and Hon. Caroline Strutt who had married on 30 August 1870. She studied at the Royal College of Science. By 1907 she was living in Kingsford, Colchester, and she died in Colchester, Essex, UK on 27 November 1972. Scientific career Digby was active in research within both botany and malacology, where she applied the technologies of cytology. Her application of cytology to the Kew primrose (Primula kewensis) provided the first example of a polyploid hybrid to be recorded. This fertile polyploid species arose through chromosome doubling in an otherwise infertile hybrid. The fertile polyploid with 36 chromosomes was formed at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew among infertile hybrids between P. verticillata, originating from Africa and Asia, and P. floribunda, from the Himalayas. The hybrids had been noticed in 1899 by staff at Kew, particularly Frank Garett, and were awarded a First Class certificate at a Royal Horticultural Society meeting in 1900. They were large plants with attractive flowers. The lack of fertile seeds despite repeated efforts at crossing the parents was a problem until some were obtained in 1905. Digby was thus able to compare both fertile and infertile hybrids. P. kewensis continued to be cited into the 21st century as an example of a new species originating from human activities. She made measurements of chromosome length, width and number during meiosis in both plants (such as smooth hawk's-beard (Crepis virens) and Primula) and animals such as Helix pomatia and Homarus gammarus. She collaborated with John B Farmer and John E S Moore, early investigators of the units of heredity. This included analysing the structure and taxonomy of some gastropods Moore had collected in Lake Tanganyika. This was at a time when the relationship of chromosome structures to inheritance was under active investigation. In addition, after the success of genetic studies in Drosophila, the selection of additional model organisms was needed to ascertain whether these findings could be generalised to all plants and animals. Smooth hawk's-beard was proposed as another model organism. Digby had studied its cytology, determining that it had 3 pairs of chromosomes. Her work on the structure of chromosomes, their changes during mitosis and meiosis and their relationship to the units of heredity was early support for the chromosome theory of inheritance. She spent some of her career at the Biological Laboratory, Royal College of Science and at the Jodrell Laboratory, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. During the First World War she spent time working as a laboratory assistant at the South African Military Hospital in Richmond Park, London. In 1919-1920 she was working with E.E. Glynn of University of Liverpool to study pneumococcal infections using serological and bacteriological methods, financed by the Medical Research Council.

She wrote under pen name Jahan ().  Life  Her birthdate is not known, but her parents were married in 1324, so she must have been born after that date. Her father was Jalal ud-Din Masudshah and mother was a daughter of Ghiyas al-Din Hamadani. Her step-mother was a Chupanid princess, Sultanbakht - daughter of Dimashq Khwaja, who married Masudshah in Baghdad in 1342. After his father's marriage, she too got married between 1343 and 1347. Groom was Amin al-Din Jahromi, companion of Injuid ruler, his uncle Shaikh Jamal al-Din Abu Ishaq. Masudshah was deposed in 1339 by allied powers of Shams al-Din Muhammad and Chupanid Pir Hosayn and fled to Luristan and was finally murdered in bath by Yagi Basti's men in 1342.Jahan Malek was brought up and guarded by his uncle Abu Ishaq. Abu Ishaq too finally fell from power in 1353 when Mubariz al-Din Muhammad captured Shiraz and executed Ishaq in 1357.  Poetry  Jahan Malek Khatun's poetry was usually love poetry. Besides, she also mentioned several rulers in her poems, like Mubariz al-Din Muhammad, Shah Shoja Mozaffari, Ahmad Jalayir, Shah Mansur and Miran Shah, giving a clue about her lifespan. She was a contemporary of Ubayd Zakani, Khwaju Kermani and Hafez. She was at odds with Ubayd Zakani who mocked her poetry alongside Kamal Khujandi. Her divan is the largest known divan from any woman poet of pre- modern times. It contains 4 qasidas, one strophe-poem, a lengthy elegy, 12 fragments, 357 rubai and 1413 ghazals. Only 4 known manuscripts are located at British Library, National Library of France, Topkapi Palace and Cambridge University Library. She was influenced by Saadi and other women poetesses of her time including Padshah Khatun and Qutluqshah Khatun (wife of √ñljait√º and daughter of Irinjin).  Publications  Being mostly out of scope of academic interest, she was published in 1995, Tehran for the first time for modern readers.

The game is set in the future and features science fiction and cyberpunk elements. It was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 15, 2020. Gameplay The player takes control of Rania, a new delivery driver for the illegal company Cloudpunk. The player has to maneuver a HOVA, a flying car, through a Cyberpunk city, collecting and delivering packages as well as passengers. It is also possible to park the car on certain parking spaces and explore parts of the city by foot. During some missions, the player can make decisions that influence the outcome and lead to different dialogues with the characters. Furthermore, the player can collect optional story items that are scattered throughout the city to unlock additional side quests and stories. It is possible to upgrade the HOVA to increase the speed and damage control, as well as buy items for Rania's apartment to decorate it. Plot Rania moved from the countryside to the city of Nivalis and is now working for Cloudpunk, a not quite legal delivery company. She gets her missions from a person called Control and has to deliver the packages without opening them and without asking questions. During her missions delivering packages, she drives around in her HOVA and visits different parts of the city. Along the way she meets different characters, including androids, AI, and humans at every level of society. Over the course of the night, Rania will be faced with different moral dilemmas as she discovers the truth about a rogue AI. Her loyal companion dog Camus joins her as a so-called Automata in the frame of the HOVA as Rania tries to collect enough money to buy a dog frame for him and make a living in this city. Development Ion Lands is an independent game developer based in Berlin, Germany and was founded in 2015. The game was announced on November 7, 2018 and was supposed to be released in 2019. It was later postponed and was released on April 23, 2020. Marko Dieckmann was the director of the game, while the story was written by Thomas Welsh. The music was created by Harry Critchley, while the voxel art was done by Ma√´va Da Silva, David Gulick, No Hoon, Maryam Khaleghi, Peter King, Sergey Munin, Niklas M√§ckle, Paul Riehle, Elo√Øse Tricoli, and Christophe Tritz. The character portraits were done by William Sweetman. The game was localized into several languages by Warlocs. The game features a cast of voice actors, including Andrea Petrille as Rania, Mike Berlak as Control, Cory Herndon as Camus, and Cam Cornelius as Huxley. Reception Cloudpunk received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 38 reviews. Richard Hoover from Adventure Gamers gave the game a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, indicating \\"very good\\", and praised the Blade Runner-esque aesthetic, the wide variety of characters, the bustling, expansive city, and the customizable vehicle, home, and outfit while criticizing that some dialogs drag on too long, traffic patterns unaware of your presence, and the lack of a save system. Hoover called the game a \\"highly compelling sci-fi experience\\". Adzuken Q. Rumpelfelt from the online magazine Destructoid gave the game a mixed review with a rating of 6.5 out of 10, saying \\"Cloudpunk is certainly a game worth seeing, but beyond that, there's not much to back up its cyberpunk aesthetic. Flying around in your hover car is a joy, and the city is a consistently surprising visual treat, but whenever the game gets around to providing context to all of it, it stumbles. You largely get what it says on the box, but Cloudpunk would have benefited from more compelling gameplay and a more focused story. It's not that it's badly designed or horribly written, it just doesn't quite reach the clouds.\\" Both Willem Hilhorst from Nintendo World Report and PJ O'Reilly from Nintendo Life were disappointed in the Nintendo Switch port of the game, criticizing the inconsistent framerate and limited draw distance evident in the port, and the downgraded visuals compared to the PC version, but praised the atmosphere and art style.

It is the headquarters of Westminster City Council. History The old Westminster City Hall in Charing Cross Road In the late 19th century the parishes of St Margaret and St John held their meetings at the old Westminster Town Hall in Caxton Street. However, after the enlarged Metropolitan Borough of Westminster was formed in 1900, civic leaders decided the Caxton Street building was inadequate for their needs, and decided to find larger facilities; they selected an existing building in Charing Cross Road which had been designed by Robert Walker and completed in 1890. The Charing Cross Road building, which adjoined the Garrick Theatre, was renamed 'Westminster City Hall' and enlarged to meet the administrative requirements of the council in 1902. In the early 1960s, in anticipation of the impending further enlargement of the council's area, civic leaders again decided they needed larger facilities; the site they selected formed part of a larger development by Land Securities on a site previously occupied by Prince's Mansions in Victoria Street. The proposed development was a high, 20-storey glass tower, designed by Burnet Tait & Partners in the modern style, which was built by Taylor Woodrow Construction. The enlarged City of Westminster was formed in March 1965, shortly before the completion of the new town hall in April 1965. Initially Westminster City Council only used the 20th floor, but gradually expanded to take the whole building. The principal rooms were the Mayor's parlour on the 19th floor and the committee rooms on the 18th floor, which were used for cabinet meetings as well as committee meetings. The building was stripped back to a concrete shell during an extensive refurbishment between 2017 and 2019.

She is known for writing Wuhan Lockdown Diary, a diary she wrote during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China. Her work has appeared in or has been covered by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Guardian, and BBC News among others. Her book, Wuhan Lockdown Diary, was published in March 2020 by Taiwan Linking Publishing Company (Âè∞ÊπæËÅîÁªèÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ). Guo is also known for her feminist activism. In 2014, she sued a company in Zhejiang Province for gender discrimination and won. Guo Jing's case is believed to be the first time in China's history that a job seeker won a gender discrimination case against a potential employer. Early life Guo was born in Henan province, China. Wuhan is her home town. Career In June of 2014, Guo applied for a copywriter position at The New Oriental Cooking Vocational Skills Training School. After failing to receive any responses, Guo called the School and asked about the position she applied for. Guo was told by the School that only male candidates would be considered for the position based on the fact that the position required many business trips and carrying heavy suitcases. Guo told the school she was happy to travel and was physically strong enough to carry heavy suitcases. Guo subsequently filed a lawsuit at Xihu District People's Court in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province on the basis that the school violated Article 3 of the Employment Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China, which requires that ‚ÄúThe workers enjoy the right to employment on an equal footing and to choice of jobs on their own initiative in accordance with law. In seeking employment, the workers shall not be subject to discrimination because of their ethnic backgrounds, races, gender, religious beliefs, etc.‚Äù The school argued that the copywriter position had a special consideration in that it required many business trips with the management of the school, all of whom are male. Therefore, they reasoned, it was out of consideration and care to the plaintiff that they did not recruit her. In November 2014, Xihu District People's Court in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province ruled in Guo's favor, finding that the school did not provide any evidence to prove the specialty of the position and the legal reasons for the unsuitability of female worker, and therefore had violated the woman's right to equal employment. The Court ruled that the school should pay Guo 2,000 yuan ($323) in compensation.

It is an economic model practiced widely by Igbos and originated in South-Eastern Nigeria. Its purposes were and still remains to spur economic growth and stability, and sustainable livelihood by financing and investing in human resources through vocational training.  Introduction  The Igbo apprentice system is an extension of their entrepreneurial spirit where an induction strategy is utilised to induct mostly young Igbos into entrepreneurial ventures by established entrepreneurs locally referred to as Oga. This venture can be a trade, an enterprise or a vocation, in some cases serving also as a domestic help. The Ogas are former apprentices that had served and were handed resources to begin their own enterprises. This system is informal and has unstructured training programs to learn and master skills required to embark on own enterprise.  History  The Igbo culture of entrepreneurship can be traced back to the slave trade business from the 15th century. By 1800s about 320,000 Igbos have been sold at Bonny, as well as 50,000 at Calabar and Elem Kalabari. This process continued until the abolition of slave trade in the 1900s. Unlike most African communities, slaves from the Igbo ethnic group were exposed to entrepreneurship by their owners trading commodities like spices, sugar, tobacco, cotton for export to the Americas, Europe and Asia. This action kindled the entrepreneurship spirit of the Igbo people and galvanized them to quickly venture into various forms of entrepreneurship during the pre- colonial era. The colonial era met the Igbos as the leading exporters of palm oil and kernel, craftsmen, traders, merchants, cottage industrialists, etc. This culture of entrepreneurship has been sustained till the present age through the apprenticeship framework.  Elements  Various skills are imbibed in the apprenticeship training period. These skills are the technical, management and interpersonal skills. Some of them are Forecasting, Human relationship management, Inventory control and Analysis, Opportunity recognition and Utilization, Supply-chain Management, Quality control, Bookkeeping and Accounting, Oral communication, Linguistic, Plan and Goal setting, Monitoring, Innovative, Marketing, Change orientation, Finance, Visionary, Leadership, Listening, Organisational culture, Network building, Negotiation, Venturing, Coaching, Customers‚Äô Relationship Management and Team playing. They also are tutored to focus on returns on investment to enhance enterprise expansion, while maintaining no familial relationship when it concerns business. These training are evidenced in provision of the sales and services solutions covering all industries and sectors the Igbos are involved in spanning the Transportation, Construction, Manufacturing, Real estate, Commerce (import and export), Mercantile Trading, ICT equipment, Artisanship, Film, Automotive, etc.  Types  The system has 3 major types - Igba-boi also known as Igba Odibo (become an apprentice), Imu Oru also known as Imu Oruaka (learn a craft) and Imu Ahia (learn a trade). While all types are geared toward the transfer knowledge of entrepreneur skills, they differ in approach. Unlike the Igba-boi/Igba Odibo where a mentee will be tutored for free for a period of pre-agreed years, in the Imu Oru/Imu Oruaka and Imu Ahia types tutorship are paid for by the mentee or mentee's parents/sponsors.  Phases  The Igbo apprentice system is a rational economic decision that uses cheap labour to build up human resources, while creating the opportunity of developing self-employed individuals. The system has three main phases or stages: Talent (or Ability) Identification, Scholarship (or Knowledge training), and Graduation (or Clearance). 3 stages of Igbo apprentice system = Talent Identification = This begins from the household on identification of the potential entrepreneur skills of a future mentee. It can also be the inability of the household to sponsor further literary education of the mentee, or the truancy of the mentee in following basic household rules and regulations. The family sets out to communicate and search for an entrepreneur to mentor their child. When a match-up is done, a traditional handing-over ceremony is conducted and parents advise the mentee on the virtues and expectation of apprenticeship. During the ceremony, the apprenticeship agreements are set and agreed by all parties to remove all instance of ambiguity. = Scholarship = The mentee is offered boarding and is expected to perform household chores as part of the training program. The basic ways of living, according to a mentor's preference is initiated at this stage. Then mentee is taken to the enterprise location to begin the induction into entrepreneurship. Both steps usually happens within the first three months of the mentee's arrival and also serves as trial period to check compatibility to the scholarship rigors. The compatibility check verifies the \\"willingness to learn,\\" \\"resilience\\" and \\"trustworthiness\\". Failure to pass at least 2 of the 3 checks leads to termination of scholarship and the mentee sent back. Specific programs tutored at this stage includes: competitiveness, business language and bargaining strategy. Others are entrepreneurial opportunities, customer relationship management, negotiation, innovative skills, and transaction processes. 3 players in the Igbo apprentice system As the Igbo‚Äôs understanding of entrepreneurship and business is embedded in a market worldview, where individuals ‚Äúbargain‚Äù themselves in or out of any situation. Hence, the entrepreneurs sees every interaction with a customer as an opportunity to bargain for a good outcome. There is equal opportunity for everyone to bargain and everything is subjected to this bargaining process. This philosophy is passed unto the apprentice. = Graduation = The completion of the entire program is typified by attaining the pre-agreed scholarship period. The mentor offers the mentee capital for a start-up subject to the mentee‚Äôs efficiency and commitment during the scholarship and the financial capacity of the mentor. This is usually done in presence of the mentee's people who host a small ceremony to mark the occasion. This stage sums the entire learning process and begins the innovation process. The essence of settlement is to initiate potential entrepreneurs into the entrepreneurship journey. They establish a venture with the rewards under the custody of their mentor. It is assumed that they must have been familiar with basic approaches required to drive an innovation, requisite skills and market linkages for alliances. Entrepreneurs use the approach to achieve market penetration, gradually delve and diversify their innovation in a perfect competitive market. Sometimes, mentors establish a little innovation, sort of extension or an outlet for their enterprise for the mentee to control under a close watch while they operate others. This is significant to enterprise growth and expansion. There is a mutual benefit to the approach. In terms of the mentees, they learn skills and benefit from rewards in the end of the contract. On the other hand, the mentor expands its enterprise using their mentees. The circle continues to revolve in view of the fact that mentees graduate to mentors and absorb mentees.  Evolution  As more Europeans gained access into South-Eastern Nigeria which is populated by the Igbos, many new types of craftmanship were introduced as a result of the Industrial Revolution, such as Painting, Mechanic, Bicycle repairing, Driving, Printing, Sewing and others. This new job fields led to the collapse of family members monopoly on providing resources to apprenticeship, as choosing job outside the family enterprise expertise started to gain prominence. This borned the ‚ÄòImu- Oru Aka‚Äô (learning a craft or skill) distinction of the System and quickly followed by ‚ÄòImu-Ahia‚Äô (learning to trade) to trade in after-sales market of the new technologies introduced into their communities as a result of the industrial revolution and had become the dominant type of the Igbo entrepreneurship and apprenticeship system.  Problems  The apprenticeship system problems are # The system has low age and educational entry barrier and lacks formal training and certifications. # Lack of teaching skills by most masters or 'Ogas' deter pupils from apprentice training completion # Lack of guaranteed access to start up funding after apprentice training completion due to general economic conditions # Lack of written contract to enable legal and regulatory backing by government or its agencies. # Innate interests, ability and capability of apprentice are not primary considerations when matching pupils with their masters # General belief that apprenticeship is for persons from poor households and unable to cope with formal education.

The drinking well is located at the foot of The Slopes (formerly St Ann's Cliff) and opposite the Crescent hotel and the Old Hall Hotel. St Ann's Well Dressing in 2007 The natural warm waters of Buxton have been revered since Roman times. By the 1520s the spring was dedicated to St Anne (mother of the Virgin Mary) and the curative powers of the waters from the well were reported. A 16th-century act of parliament ruled that a free supply of the spring water must be provided for the town's residents. The geothermal spring rises from about 1km below ground and about a million litres of water flow out per day. The mineral water emerges at a steady 27¬∞C. Analysis of the water has indicated that it has a high magnesium content and that it originated from rainwater from around 5,000 years ago. The same spring water is bottled and sold as Buxton Mineral Water. Bronze lion spout of St Ann's Well  Roman baths  The Roman settlement of Aquae Arnemetiae was based around Buxton's natural warm spring. Aquae Arnemetiae means 'Waters of Arnemetia'. Arnemetia was the Romano-British goddess of the sacred grove (the name Arnemetia was derived from the Celtic for beside the sacred grove).Miranda J. Green. Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend. Thames and Hudson Ltd, London, 1997. The Romans built a bath at the location of the main thermal spring. In the late 17th-century Cornelius White operated bathing facilities at the hot spring at the site of the Buxton Old Hall. In 1695 he discovered an ancient smooth stone bath (20m long by 7m wide) as well as a lead cistern (2m square) on an oak timber frame. When the Crescent hotel was built on the site in 1780, a Roman bath was identified and described as ‚Äòa leaden cistern'. The bath is now buried beneath the Crescent, next to the Natural Mineral Baths building that was constructed next to the hotel. Near to the site of the main spring, excavations in 2005 revealed the entry passage and doorways to the Roman baths. Between 2009 and 2012 further underground cisterns and a large iron cauldron were revealed. The main spring was excavated in the 1970s and a hoard of 232 Roman coins was found, spanning 300 years of the Roman occupation of Britain. Coins would have been thrown into the sacred waters to seek the favour of the Gods. The coins and pieces of bronze jewellery found with them are on display in the Buxton Museum.  Healing waters  In the 1460s antiquarian William Worcester wrote of the Buxton spring waters in his book Itinerarium: > \\"Memorandum that Holywell ... makes many miracles, making the infirm > healthy, and in winter it is warm, even as honeyed milk.\\" During Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries, Thomas Cromwell closed St Ann's Well in 1538, ordering it to be \\"locked up and sealed\\". In 1572 Dr John Jones wrote the first medical book on Buxton waters entitled 'The Benefit of the Auncient Bathes of Buckstones'. Mary Queen of Scots visited the well most years from 1573 to 1584, under guard and for up to a month at a time. By command of Queen Elizabeth I, she was held prisoner at Chatsworth House several times between 1569 and 1584. Mary was granted permission by the Queen to ‚Äòtake the cure‚Äô for her rheumatism at St Ann's Well in Buxton. Before leaving in 1584, she etched in Latin on the window of her room at the Buxton Old Hall: > \\"Buxton, whose fame thy milk-waters tell, Whom I, perhaps, no more shall > see, farewell.\\" The Seven Wonders of the Peak were described in the 17th century by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes. After touring the High Peak in 1626, Hobbes published his 84-page Latin poem De Mirabilibus Pecci in 1636. It was published with an English translation in 1676. He recounted: > \\"Of the High Peak are seven wonders writ. Two fonts, two caves. One pallace, > mount and pit.\\" He wrote about St Ann's Well (one of the 'two fonts'):  Georgian and Victorian spa  St Anne's Drinking Well in 1784 St Ann's Well was declared to be public property by the 1772 Buxton Enclosure Act, with an obligation for it to be maintained in good condition. Each Easter week the parish Vestry appointed a poor woman as the 'Well Woman' to take care of the well and to help those taking the water. Martha Norton performed this role for 15 years between 1775 and 1820. The position was unpaid and depended on tips, until paid attendants were appointed from 1875. Architect John Carr designed the 1783 drinking well to comply with the Enclosure Act. The Georgian spa town blossomed with the building of the Crescent in the 1780s opposite St Ann's Well. It was commissioned by the 5th Duke of Devonshire and it was also designed by John Carr. Buxton's development as a Victorian spa town centered on the reputed healing powers of its natural mineral baths. The Buxton Bath Charity and numerous independent establishments offered hydropathic treatments using the thermal spring waters. Dr William Henry Robertson wrote the definitive guide to the Buxton waters, with its analysis of their medicinal properties. St Ann's Drinking Well of 1852 The new St Ann's drinking well of 1852 was designed by architect Henry Currey and it dispensed warm chalybeate (mineral-bearing) spring water alongside a cold water pump. The Pump Room was built next to St Ann's Well in 1894 to dispense the well's water from taps for drinking. The building (designed by Henry Currey) was a gift to the town by the 8th Duke of Devonshire, to safeguard the free public access to the water. In 1895 a new public drinking pump was erected next to the Pump Room. The current water fountain was built in 1940 and is a Grade II listed structure. It is made of ashlar gritstone with a brass lion's head spout pouring water into a marble trough. The inscription over the well is a tribute to Emelie Dorothy Bounds, Councillor of this Borough, by her husband and daughter. The Pump Room is a Grade II listed building and is now the Buxton Tourist Information centre. St Ann's Drinking Well of 1895 Buxton Pump Room at the foot of The Slopes The annual celebration of well dressing (a centuries-old tradition in Derbyshire) was re-established in Victorian Buxton. In 1949 Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip attended the St Ann's Well dressing during their visit to Buxton.  Buxton Mineral Water  Drinking water from St Ann's Well has been bottled for sale since the 19th-century. The London Morning Advertiser on Tuesday 17th April 1855 carried a front page advert for: > \\"Buxton Mineral Waters ‚Äì Bottled by authority at St. Ann‚Äôs Springs. ‚Äì Sold > in Pint Bottles, with direction for Use, by Francis E. Nielson, > Pharmaceutical Chemist, the Quadrant, Buxton\\" A trademark for bottled Buxton Water (sourced from the well) was registered by the Buxton Mineral Water Company in 1876. The trademark was embossed in a diamond shape on the glass Hamilton bottles. To retain the effervescence of the water, a Codd bottle used a rubber seal and a sliding marble within its neck. From the 1920s, soda syphons (seltzer bottles) became popular for buyers of Buxton Water. During the later 20th-century there was a move to screw caps glass bottles and more recently plastic bottles. Nestl√© acquired the Buxton Mineral Water Company in 1992. In 2012 it opened its new bottling plant at Waterswallows, with water piped from the original source at St Ann's spring two miles away.

It is protected by the central government as a National Historic Site. Overview In what is now the city of ≈åsh≈´, the Kitakami River makes a 180 degree bend. This was a naturally defensive location, and the 8th son of Abe no Yoritoki built a fortified settlement at this location towards the end of the Heian period. This was destroyed by the Minamoto clan during the Former Nine Years' War of 1051 to 1063. At the time of the Gosannen War (1083-1089), Fujiwara no Kiyohira occupied this location and built a palace. As a result of archaeological excavations in 2003 and 2017, it was confirmed that this location was fortified with a moat and earthen rampart, and had a pier and a crafts production area. It appeared to be both a center for riverine traffic on the Kitakami River, but also a manufacturing location supporting the Northern Fujiwara capital of Hiraizumi. A number of crystal beads (1.8 cm in diameter) that closely resembles the beads on statues at the temple of Chuson-ji were found, along with many Chinese and domestic ceramics shards and broken roof tiles. The remains of a blacksmith's forge were also found. A porcelain kiln remained functioning at this location into the Kamakura periods and a village existed until the Edo Period. The site received protection as a National Historic Site in 1997, together with the Yanagi-no-Gosho ruins in Hiraizumi and the Ch≈çjagahara temple ruins in ≈åsh≈´. It was included in the original 2006 nomination of \\"Hiraizumi - Cultural Landscape Associated with Pure Land Buddhist Cosmology\\". However, it was removed from the nomination after the failure to secure inscription in 2008, although there are continuing efforts to secure its inclusion through future extension.

She was unraced as a two-year-old but quickly established herself as a top-class performer in the spring of 2003, winning her first three races including the Prix Melisande and Prix de Diane. She sustained her first defeat in the Prix Jacques Le Marois but then produced her best performance to overcome a strong international field in the Prix du Moulin. She failed to win in 2004 but ran well in defeat to finish third in both the Prix d'Astarte and the Sun Chariot Stakes and fourth in the Queen Anne Stakes. After her retirement from racing she produced several winners. Background Nebraska Tornado is a dark bay mare with a narrow white blaze and two white socks bred in Kentucky, by her owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. She was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre at Chantilly in France. She was from the twelfth crop of foals sired by Storm Cat, a high-class racehorse who won the Young America Stakes and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 1985. He went on to become an exceptionally successful breeding stallion, and was the Leading sire in North America in 1999 and 2000. The best of his progeny included Aljabr, Bluegrass Cat, Cat Thief, Forestry, Sophisticat, Giant's Causeway, Hold That Tiger, Jalil, Life Is Sweet, One Cool Cat, Storm Flag Flying and Tabasco Cat. Nebraska Tornado's dam Media Nox showed high-class racing ability in a brief track career, winning the Prix du Bois in the first of her three starts, and went on to become a successful broodmare, producing several other winners including the Prix Eug√®ne Adam winner Burning Sun. She was descended from the American broodmare Woozem (foaled 1964) who won the Demoiselle Stakes and was a half-sister to Gallant Romeo (Vosburgh Stakes). Racing career =2003: three-year-old season= Nebraska Tornado did not race as a juvenile and began her track career in the Prix Hildegarde, a maiden race over 1600 metres on soft ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 5 May. Ridden by Olivier Placais she started the 1.4/1 favourite and won by one and a half lengths from Precious Pearl after taking the lead 200 metres from the finish. Christophe Soumillon took the ride when the filly was steppe d up in class and distance for the Listed Prix Melisande over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse seventeen days later. Starting at odds of 4.5/1 in a twelve-runner field she went to the front in the straight and won by one and a half lengths from La Sabana. In the Group 1 Prix de Diane at Chantilly Racecourse Nebraska Tornado was partnered by Richard Hughes and was made the 5.5/1 third choice in the betting behind Fidelite (winner of the Prix Saint- Alary) and Musical Chimes (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches). The other seven runners included Cassis (Musidora Stakes), Baie (Prix Finlande), Vallee Enchantee (Prix Isonomy) and Campsie Fells (Prix Vanteaux). After racing close behind the front-running outsider aaaaa Nebraska Tornado gained the advantage 400 metres from the finish, accelerated into a clear lead, and then kept on well under pressure to win by three quarters of a length from the British- trained Time Ahead. After a break of over two months Nebraska Tornado was dropped back in distance at Deauville Racecourse on 17 August for the 1600 metre Prix Jacques Le Marois, a race which saw her matched against male opposition for the first time. She was amongst the leaders from the start and went to the front 200 metres out before being outpaced in the closing stages and coming home sixth behind Six Perfections, Domedriver, Telegnosis, Special Kaldoun and Dubai Destination. On 7 September at Longchamp Nebraska Tornado, with Hughes in the saddle, started a 14.6/1 outsider for the Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres on good-to-soft ground. The 2002 Prix de Diane winner Bright Sky went off favourite while the other twelve runners included Domedriver, Telegnosis, Special Kaldoun, Soviet Song, Reel Buddy, Refuse To Bend, Where Or When and Clodovil (Poule d'Essai des Poulains). In a race run in heavy rain, Nebraska Tornado settling in second behind the Japanese challenger Lohengrin before going to the front in the last 200 metres and winning by half a length. Very few of the other runners were able to get into contention, although Bright Sky and Soviet Song finished strongly to take third and fourth. After the race Andr√© Fabre said \\"I'm delighted as I know she's a top-class filly with a lot of speed ‚Äì I'm not surprised or I wouldn't have run her. She's a filly who has really only just come to herself as she was growing in the summer\\" while Hughes commented \\"That was brilliant. She's as good as Banks Hill if not better.\\" Although she was expected to run in the Breeders' Cup Mile Nebraska Tornado did not race again in 2003. In the International Classification for 2003 (the forerunner of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings) Nebraska Tornado was given a rating of 117, making her the 73rd best racehorse and the second best three-year-old filly. =2004: four-year-old season= Nebraska Tornado began her second campaign in the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp on 23 May when she started second favourite but was reluctant to enter the starting stalls and finished last of the five runners behind the Italian-trained outsider Prince Kirk. She was then sent to England to contest the Queen Anne Stakes on good-to-firm ground at Royal Ascot and produced a better performance, taking the lead three furlongs from the finish and maintaining her advantage until being outpaced in the closing stages and coming home fourth behind Refuse To Bend, Soviet Song and Salselon. In the Prix d'Astarte at Deauville on 1 August she returned to all-female competition and started the 1.1/1 favourite in an eight-runner field. Ridden as in her last two races by Gary Stevens she disputed the lead from the start but was again beaten for pace in the last 200 metres and finished third to Marbye and Majestic Desert, beaten just over a length by the winner. After a break of two months, Nebraska Tornado returned on 2 October to contest the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and finished third behind Attraction and Chic, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. For her final race she was sent to Texas for the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Lone Star Park on 30 October. Competing on dirt for the first time she raced in second place before dropping out of contention in the straight and coming home eighth behind Ashado. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Nebraska Tornado was retired to become a broodmare for Juddmonte. She produced at least six foals and four winners: *Panorama Ridge, a bay filly, foaled in 2006, sired by Empire Maker. Won one race. *Cornhusker, bay colt (later gelded), 2007, by Dynaformer.

Headed by a special director general of police-rank officer and headquartered at New Delhi, it is the largest sector of CISF in terms of number of personnel deployed. It provides security coverage to 63 national and international airports in the country.  History  CISF was first inducted at Jaipur Airport The security of commercial airports in India was under the control of airport police of respective states where the relevant airports were situated before it was decided that a single agency should hold this responsibility. After the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 on 7 December 1999, the Government of India decided on 7 January 2000 to handover the security of airports in the country to the Central Industrial Security Force in a phased manner. First such induction of CISF was happened on 3 February 2000 when it took over the security of Jaipur Airport in Rajasthan. The process of inducting CISF at the different airports was accelerated after the September 11 attacks in the United States in which four passenger aeroplanes were hijacked by terrorists.  Structure  The Central Industrial Security Force is divided into various sectors with each headed by an inspector general-rank officer known as the Sector Inspector General.

He practised medicine in Baghdad and wrote in Arabic about medicine, canon law, theology and philosophy. His biblical exegesis remains the most influential written in Arabic and he was an important commentator on Galen and Aristotle. He also produced translations from Syriac into Arabic. Life Ibn al-·π¨ayyib studied medicine and probably philosophy under Ab≈´ al-Khayr ibn SuwƒÅr ibn al-KhammƒÅr. Some modern authors also make him a student of Ab≈´  øAlƒ´  øƒ™sƒÅ ibn Zur øa. He taught and practised medicine at the hospital (al-mƒÅristƒÅn) al- øA·∏çudƒ´ in Baghdad. Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn,  øAlƒ´ ibn  øƒ™sƒÅ al-Ka·∏•·∏•ƒÅl and Ab≈´ al-·∏§usayn al-Ba·π£rƒ´ were among his pupils. The main source for his medical career is Ibn Abƒ´ U·π£aybi øa's biographical dictionary. Ibn al-·π¨ayyib held the office of patriarchal secretary (kƒÅtib al-jƒÅthalƒ´q) under two patriarchs of the Church of the East, Y≈´·∏•annƒÅ ibn NƒÅz≈´k (1012/13‚Äì1020/22) and Eliya I (1028‚Äì1049), and was responsible for the synod that elected Eliya. As secretary to the latter, he approved the apologetic work of Eliya of Nisibis. According to Bar Hebraeus, writing in the 13th century, he was a monk, but this is difficult to square with his career as a physician. There are hints that Ibn al-·π¨ayyib suffered a nervous breakdown from intellectual strain. His contemporary, Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ, seems to have heard about it. There is some uncertainty about the date of Ibn al‚Äë·π¨ayyib's death. According to al-Qif·π≠ƒ´, writing early in the 13th century, he died between AH 420 and 435, that is, between January 1029 and July 1044. According to Bar Hebraeus, he died in the month of first Tishrƒ´n in the year 1355 of the Seleucid era, which corresponds to October 1043. Writing the 14th century, ·π¢alƒ´bƒÅ ibn Y≈´·∏•annƒÅ places his burial in AH 434, that is, between August 1042 and August 1043. He records that he was buried in the chapel of the monastery Dayr DurtƒÅ. After his death, a debate took place in Cairo between his student Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn and  øAlƒ´ ibn Ri·∏çwƒÅn concerning whether a medical student should learn only through books or through teachers as well. Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn defended the role of his teacher. Works Over forty works written by Ibn al-·π¨ayyib have been identified and all are written in Arabic. Besides his knowledge of Syriac and Arabic, he may have known some Greek. Samir Khalil Samir notes that in all his works in every genre, Ibn al-·π¨ayyib always structures his introduction or prologue in the same way as a series of answers to seven implicit questions: who wrote it, to whom, for what purpose, etc. =Exegesis= Ibn al-·π¨ayyib \\"remains the foremost biblical exegete in Arabic\\" who produced \\"the greatest exegetical collections of Christian Arabic literature\\". He wrote a compendious biblical commentary, Firdaws al-na·π£rƒÅniyya (Paradise of Christianity), drawing heavily on Syriac sources, such as the Scholion of Theodore bar Koni, the Selected Questions of Isho ø bar Nun and the commentaries of Isho ødad of Merv and Moshe bar Kepha. This work circulated widely and brought the Coptic and Ethiopian churches into contact with the exegetical tradition of the Church of the East. In Ethiopia, it was translated into Ge'ez and subsequently into Amharic. It was highly influential on the Amharic Andemta commentaries. Besides the Firdaws, he wrote separate commentaries on the Psalms and the Gospels. For the former, he translated the Psalms from the Syriac Peshitta into Arabic. He started a commentary on the Pauline and general epistles, but it is now lost. The three separate commentaries seem to have been abridged for incorporation into the Firdaws. Although his exegetical works are the longest he wrote on religious topics, they are still largely unedited and unpublished. Only the commentary on Genesis in the Firdaws has seen a critical edition. The opening section of the introduction of the Firdaws is lost. Ibn al-·π¨ayyib's exegesis belongs to the traditions of the school of Antioch, emphasising literal, moral and historical interpretation. According to the introduction to his commentary on the Gospels, his goal was the preservation of the Syriac exegetical tradition in Arabic. This seems to have been a motivation in all his exegetical writing. To that end, he was a compiler and synthesist more than an original interpreter. When he relies on Greek fathers like Theodore of Mopsuestia and John Chrysostom, he appears to be drawing from other compilations. =Theology and canon law= Ibn al-·π¨ayyib wrote over a dozen treatises on theology. His theological magnum opus was MaqƒÅla fƒ´ l-us≈´l al-dƒ´niyya (Treatise on Religious Principles). It is lost, although a description of its contents survives. Al- Mu ætaman ibn al- øAssƒÅl records that he wrote a fourteen-chapter systematic theology (possibly the MaqƒÅla) and a treatise on christology, the KitƒÅb al- itti·∏•ƒÅd. Despite his close proximity to Muslims, Ibn al-·π¨ayyib never mentions Islam in his theological works. A desire to defend against Islamic accusations of tritheism may lie behind his emphasis on the unity of the Trinity. He held to the traditional theology of the Church of the East and wrote a \\"Refutation of Those Who Say that Mary is the Mother of God\\", denying the Virgin Mary the title of Theotokos. He also wrote a defence of theological rationalism in Qawl fƒ´ l- øilm wa-l-mu øjiza (Treatise on Science and Miracle). He wrote a treatise on the canon law of the Church of the East, Fiqh al-na·π£rƒÅniyya (Law of Christianity). This compilation cited canons from the ecumenical councils Nicaea and Chalcedon, from the councils of the Church of the East as collected by Patriarch Timothy I and from later councils down to his own day. He also made extensive use of the late 9th-century Syriac legal collection of Gabriel of Ba·π£ra. The work was organized thematically. Topics include betrothals, marriages, guardianship, taxes, debts, deeds and inheritance. The importance of these topics lay in the fact that the Christian dhimma was permitted to judge these matters among themselves, but errors could lead to lawsuits taken to Islamic courts. He also wrote a short \\"Response to an Enquiry about the Ending of Marriages and Divorce\\". Ibn al-·π¨ayyib is probably responsible for the Arabic translation of the Syriac Diatessaron of Tatian. =Philosophy= In philosophy, Ibn al-·π¨ayyib was an Aristotelian, albeit influenced heavily by the Neoplatonists Porphyry, Ammonius Hermiae, Olympiodorus the Younger, Simplicius of Cilicia, John Philoponus and Elias. He is sometimes regarded as the last in a long Christian Aristotelian tradition in Baghdad following ·∏§unayn ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq, Is·∏•ƒÅq ibn ·∏§unayn, MattƒÅ ibn Y≈´nus and Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn  øAdƒ´. The Muslim philosophers Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and the Jewish philosopher Maimonides were all acquainted with his philosophy. He wrote commentaries on the entire Organon of Aristotle, but only that on the Categories has survived in full and only an abstract of the commentary on the Posterior Analytics survives. He also wrote a commentary on the Isagoge of Porphyry, which was itself an introduction to the Categories. Taken all together, this Aristotelian project seems to have been designed as a curriculum for teaching logic. His commentaries are not particularly original. In structure and content they follow closely the commentaries of Olympiodorus. He is more systematic than his models, endeavouring to build an Aristotelian system exclusively from the texts of Aristotle. His interpretations of Aristotle never derive from other commentators but always exclusively from the Aristotelian texts. Ibn al-·π¨ayyib's commentary on the Metaphysics, mentioned by Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn, is lost. Notes from hi lectures on Aristotle's Physics were kept by al-Ba·π£rƒ´. Although these are mostly just summaries of Aristotle's arguments, Ibn al-·π¨ayyib differed from Aristotle in arguing that the First Mover's first movement must have been an act of creation. Ibn al-·π¨ayyib's commentary on the History of Animals survives only in a Hebrew translation, which was popular among the Jews of medieval Spain. Only a few questions are preserved from the original work in Arabic. It evidently relied on ·∏§unayn ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq's revision of Aristotle's text. It was cited as a source by Pedro Gallego in his Book of Animals in the 13th century. Ibn al-·π¨ayyib epitomised and paraphrased the Laws of Plato, although he was working from a synopsis of Plato, either Galen's or al-FƒÅrƒÅbƒ´'s. A lecture on Aristotle economics is attributed to Ibn al-·π¨ayyib. He also wrote some ethical treatises, including a commentary on the Arabic translation of the Tabula Cebetis of Ibn Miskawayh. He also translated the pseudo-Aristotelian On Virtues and Vices from Syriac. =Medicine= Ibn al-·π¨ayyib wrote several medical treatises, including commentaries on Hippocrates and Galen. He wrote commentaries called thimƒÅr on the sixteen collected volumes of Galen known as the Summaria Alexandrinorum, which formed the basis of the curriculum in the medical school of Alexandria. RisƒÅla fƒ´ l-QuwƒÅ al-·π≠abƒ´ øƒ´ya, his commentary on Galen's On the Natural Forces, prompted a rebuttal by Ibn SinƒÅ and the two works were often copied together.

He was the mayor of Philadelphia from 1769 to 1771 and served in various positions in the city including councilman, member of the Provincial Assembly, Justice of the Peace and treasurer from 1755 to 1778. Shoemaker was a committed British loyalist during the American Revolution. Biography Samuel Shoemaker was born in 1725 in Philadelphia. His parents were Benjamin Shoemaker and Sarah Coates. Benjamin was politically active in Philadelphia, serving three times as the city's major, between 1743 and 1760. The Shoemaker family was descended from a German family from Cresheim in Germany. Early in his career, Samuel was an attorney with the Pennsylvania Land Company in London. he was also a founder of Pennsylvania Hospital, the first hospital in the United States. In 1755, was elected as a common councilman and in 1766 was elected to the Board of Aldermen. In 1767, he became the city treasurer, taking over from his father. Shoemaker was elected as mayor on October 3, 1769 and was re-elected the following year. After his term as mayor, he joined the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly in 1771. Shoemaker was a loyalist during the American Revolution. In 1777, he was arrested but was not deported to Virginia when he promised to confine himself to his house and not communicate with the British. After the capture of Philadelphia by the British Army in late 1777, Shoemaker served as a justice under the occupation. In June 1778, British General Henry Clinton took over command and ordered his troops to abandon Philadelphia and reinforce New York City after the British defeat at the Battle of Saratoga. Shoemaker and other loyalists accompanied the army north. In New York, Shoemaker reportedly helped obtain the release of some American prisoners in the city with the help of his relationships. The Treaty of Paris ended the American Revolution in September 1783 and, in November of that year, the British Army withdrew from New York. Shoemaker and his son Edward sailed for England with the British. Because of his loyalism, Shoemaker was considered to have committed treason and, as a result, much of his property was seized by the American government in 1783 and sold. The conclusion of the peace treaties preserved the remainder of his property. While in England, he became friends with Benjamin West, a Pennsylvania-born artist known for his scenes including, The Death of Nelson. Shoemaker's diary recorded a meeting with King George III that West arranged. In 1789, Shoemaker returned to Pennsylvania. On October 10, 1800, Shoemaker died in Philadelphia. Personal life and family Shoemaker married Hannah Carpenter in 1746. They had 11 children together before her death in 1766. In 1767, he married Rebecca Rawle, the widow of Francis Rawle and had a son, Edward, and a daughter, Ann. Their home, now known as Laurel Hill Mansion still stands in east Fairmount Park and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Published in 1926 by William Heinemann, it is a Georgic celebration of the rural landscape, traditions and history of the Kentish Weald where Sackville-West lived. The poem was popular enough for there to be six print runs in the first three years of its publication aided in part by its winning the Hawthornden Prize for Literature. Background Sackville-West began working on the poem while accompanying her husband Harold Nicolson, who was an English diplomat, to the East. Nicolson records in his diary before leaving that Sackville-West had ‚Äúan idea of writing a sort of English Georgics‚Äù. It has been speculated that the poem was a response to the homesickness that she felt for her home in Kent.Glendinning, Vita, 119. Form and content The poem adopts the traditional Georgic structure of the four seasons and is divided into four parts, running from Winter to Autumn, and documenting the agricultural traditions and changing landscape through the year. The poem‚Äôs intention to capture the natural processes that exist outside of history are made clear in the opening lines: In this respect, Sackville-West‚Äôs poem can be read within a transhistorical poetic tradition that includes Virgil‚Äôs Georgics (which provides the book‚Äôs epigraph), Hesiod‚Äôs Works and Days, and James Thomson‚Äôs The Seasons. Sackville-West, however, claimed not to have read the Georgics until more than half of the poem had been written.Blyth, 'A Sort of English Georgics‚Äô, 21-22. Some critics have read Sackville-West‚Äôs poem as a response to the bleaker outlook and modernist style of T.S. Eliot‚Äôs The Waste Land, which was published four-years prior. Where Eliot‚Äôs work is famously difficult, pushing the boundaries of form, Sackville-West‚Äôs turn to tradition can be seen as an act of literary conservatism. Yet, while The Land is often read as a work steeped in tradition, critics have pointed to the way in which the poem‚Äôs seeming conservatism allowed it to smuggle expressions of lesbian desire past the censor. For instance, Suzanne Raitt reads the poem as ‚Äòtypical of the homosexual subculture of the 1920s and 1930s‚Äô in it suggestive use of natural metaphors and rural spaces.Raitt, Vita & Virginia, 12. The poem also arguably expresses Sackville-West‚Äôs frustration with being disinherited from Knole on account of her sex: Reception and awards The poem was awarded the Hawthornden Prize in 1927. The poem‚Äôs broader critical reception was more mixed. In her review of the poem for T.P.‚Äôs Weekly, the writer Rebecca West described the poem as having ‚Äòthe least chance of survival‚Äô since, while ‚Äòa very fine achievement‚Äô it neither gives ‚Äòintense pleasure‚Äô nor ‚Äòextend[s] our knowledge of reality by making explicit a certain phase of our experience‚Äô.West, 'Poetry of 1927', 388-89 The Land in Orlando Virginia Woolf satirises The Land in her novel Orlando: A Biography, whose central protagonist is partially based on Sackville-West, who was her lover during the 1920s. Orlando is described as working on a poem entitled ‚ÄòThe Oak Tree‚Äô, which the novel presents as having ‚Äònothing of the modern spirit‚Äô but nonetheless winning a popular literary award. Later, when Orlando tries to bury the poem at the base of the oak tree which inspired it, Woolf writes that it was ‚Äúa return to the land of what the land has given me‚Äù. Many critics have picked up on this intertextual dimension and seen it as reflecting Woolf‚Äôs ambivalence towards Sackville-West‚Äôs literary output.Bazargan, 'The Uses of The Land, 36-37.

They would have a healthy rivalry throughout their careers. In 1930, Chakraverti joined the Royal Indian Marine (RIM) as a cadet. He was trained in the United Kingdom for three years, among which he spent on the Heavy cruiser . He was appointed a sub-lieutenant in the RIM on 1 September 1934.On 2 October 1934, the RIM was renamed Royal Indian Navy (RIN). He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in the RIN on 1 September 1937. =World War II= With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Chakraverti underwent a specialist gunnery course in the United Kingdom. He returned to India in March 1941 and was appointed Second- in-command of the RIN Gunnery School in Bombay. He was promoted to the acting rank of Lieutenant Commander in October 1943 and was appointed Staff Officer Gunnery at Naval Headquarters. He was involved in minesweeping operations off Burma and the Malacca Strait in the far-east. Chakraverti was promoted substantive Lieutenant Commander on 18 September 1945. For distinguished services during the war in the Far-East, he was mentioned in dispatches in June 1946. As the senior-most Naval officer, he led the Naval contingent at the London Victory Celebrations of 1946. In 1946, he attended the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. After completing the year-long staff course, he returned to India and was appointed Commanding Officer of the gunnery school, HMIS Himalaya, in Karachi. In June 1947, he was promoted to the acting rank of Captain. He subsequently took over as the Chief of Administration (COA) at Naval HQ. =Post-Independence= After the partition of India, Chakraverti continued as COA.

More than 99.9% of people are positive for the Lan antigen. Individuals with the rare Lan-negative blood type, which is a recessive trait, can produce an anti-Lan antibody when exposed to Lan-positive blood. Anti-Lan antibodies may cause transfusion reactions on subsequent exposures to Lan-positive blood, and have also been implicated in mild cases of hemolytic disease of the newborn. However, the clinical significance of the antibody is variable. The antigen was first described in 1961, and Lan was officially designated a blood group in 2012. Molecular biology Autosomal recessive inheritance The Lan antigen is carried on the protein ABCB6, an ATP-binding cassette transporter encoded by the ABCB6 gene on chromosome 2q36. The Lan-negative blood type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, being expressed by individuals who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of ABCB6. Some variant alleles cause a weak positive phenotype, which may be mistaken for a Lan-negative phenotype in serologic testing. As of 2018, more than 40 null or weak alleles of ABCB6 have been described. ABCB6 is involved in heme synthesis and porphyrin transport and is widely expressed throughout the body, particularly in the heart, skeletal muscle, eye, fetal liver, mitochondrial membrane, and Golgi bodies. The Lan antigen is more strongly expressed on cord blood cells than on adult red blood cells. Despite the protein's wide distribution, Lan-negative individuals do not appear to experience any adverse effects from the absence of ABCB6. It is thought that other porphyrin transporters, such as ABCG2 (which carries the Junior blood group antigen), may compensate. A 2018 study found that Lan-negative blood cells exhibited resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. Epidemiology The prevalence of the Lan antigen exceeds 99.9% in most populations. The frequency of the Lan-negative blood type is estimated at 1 in 50,000 in Japanese populations, 1 in 20,000 in Caucasians, and 1 in 1,500 in black people from South Africa. Clinical significance When Lan-negative individuals are exposed to Lan-positive blood through transfusion or pregnancy, they may develop an anti-Lan antibody. Anti- Lan is considered a clinically significant antibody, but its effects are variable. It has been associated with severe transfusion reactions and mild cases of hemolytic disease of the newborn, but in some cases individuals with the antibody have not experienced any adverse effects from exposure to Lan- positive blood. It is recommended that individuals with anti-Lan are transfused with Lan-negative blood, especially if the antibody titer is high. One case of autoimmune hemolytic anemia involving auto-anti-Lan has been described. Laboratory testing Serologic reagents and molecular assays for Lan antigen typing were not commercially available as of 2013. Anti-Lan antibodies are typically composed of immunoglobulin G and may bind complement. As an IgG antibody, anti-Lan can be detected using the indirect antiglobulin test. The antibody is resistant to treatment with ficin, papain, trypsin, DTT, and EDTA/glycine-acid. History The Lan antigen was first described in 1961 by Van der Hart et al., when a Dutch patient suffered a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction. The patient was found to produce an antibody that reacted with all but 1 out of 4,000 blood donors tested. The causative antigen was identified and designated \\"Langereis\\" after the patient's last name. Lan was officially designated a blood group by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in 2012, following the discovery of the molecular basis of the Lan-negative phenotype.
